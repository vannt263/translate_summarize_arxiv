    "research on directed transport at the microscopic level has benefitted enormously from the interaction and mutual stimulation of applied studies close to experimentally accessible phenomena and theoretical analyses , the paradigm case being the concept of brownian motors @xcite as it emerged from the discovery of motor molecules generating directed transport in the living cell @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , the distance between the two endeavours remains large .",
    "an example is the degree of structural complexity , reflected in the number of degrees of freedom involved , of the models considered on either side : while realistic molecular - dynamics simulations of biomolecules typically include the full set of hundreds or thousands of nuclear freedoms , plus possibly some of the surrounding solvent ( for a review see , e.g. , ) , the key notion of ratchets has been developed considering mere point particles in one - dimensional periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "efforts are under way on both sides to bring these ends closer to one another . on the one hand , in molecular biophysics ,",
    "the concept of functional degree of freedom @xcite has been conceived for large - scale conformational changes on long timescales that are immediately responsible , e.g. , for the catalytic activity of a protein , and can be identified on basis of objective criteria such as normal - mode analysis to establish a hierarchy among the modes from slow to fast and from collective ( global ) to microscopic . on the other hand ,",
    "elementary ratchet models are being endowed one by one with additional freedoms to study their possible rle in directed transport @xcite .",
    "the present work is intended to insert another stepstone from the side of abstract ratchet models towards biophysical realism , by incorporating a few crucial features of molecular motors : we devise a model that includes an internal freedom to represent some functionally relevant conformational change .",
    "the concept of molecular _ combustion _ motor is incorporated replacing the familiar periodic external driving by a chemical freedom as coherent energy source which maintains the system far from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous rle of thermal fluctuations is modeled , as usually , by random forces . at the same time , we avoid the detailed reconstruction of any specific system such as @xmath0-atpase @xcite or even their reduction to `` mechanical toy models '' @xcite which typically still are tailored to represent a certain ( species of ) motor molecule and therefore involve some contingency .",

    "the dynamics of our model is simulated in the underdamped regime , allowing for complex deterministic motion , and in the presence of thermal noise , analyzed as to transport mechanisms involving the internal freedom as essential element .",
    "we find evidence , above all , that it serves as a temporary energy storage which partially decouples directed transport from the energy source and thus decorrelates the discrete steps in the external freedom from the likewise approximately quantized discharges of chemical energy into the system  certainly desirable features from the point of view of robustness , efficiency , and versatility of a molecular motor .",

    "the formulation of our model is inspired in various respects by the example of f1-atpase , a prototypical rotational molecular motor @xcite , but does not intend its reconstruction in any biophysical detail , i.e. , is to be considered an impressionist view , at most , of that molecule .",

    "we find convincing evidence that it serves as an interface which effectively decouples the output of mechanical work in the form of transport steps from the energy input through hydrolysis or similar reactions .",
    "we can observe directly how energy is being stored temporarily in the internal degree of freedom before being channeled to the external freedom .",
    "in addition , the internal freedom induces transitions towards a more irregular dynamics of the external freedom , which also contributes to the generation of directed currents .    these results direct attention to processes of energy transfer and dissipation within the molecule , and in particular indicate the functional advantage of a cascaded energy redistribution through intermediate steps @xcite , refining the simple picture of an external ( transport ) degree of freedom coupled directly to a structureless bath . even within the scope of our three - dimensional model ,",
    "such questions could be studied by changing the configuration of couplings , e.g. , coupling the external to the chemical freedom only through the internal one instead of internal  external  chemical as in the present work .",
    "subtler effects of noisy nonlinear dynamics like stochastic resonance have not been considered in depth . in the context of our model , it is expected to occur in a parameter regime of weak noise close to a resonance of the chemical with the external freedom , cf .   sec .",

    "quantum effects have not been taken into account , either .",
