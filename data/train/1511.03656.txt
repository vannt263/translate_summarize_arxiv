    "the advanced ligo interferometers ( aligo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have very recently started observational science runs , soon to be joined by other upgraded detectors .",
    "for the first time there is a realistic prospect for detection of an astrophysical gravitational wave ( gw ) transient , with a range of possible electromagnetic counterparts @xcite .",
    "rapid multi - wavelength followup might then allow detection and characterization of astrophysical gravitational wave sources ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , greatly enhancing the scientific utility of such a discovery .",
    "for instance , we might be able to conclusively determine the origin of short - duration grbs ( sgrbs ; see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) which are generally accepted to originate from neutron star - neutron star mergers .",
    "even before aligo begins operation , prompt radio followup of sgrbs may give clues as to their origin and help tie them to other mysterious phenomena .",
    "specifically , a number of authors have suggested the possibility of prompt , coherent radio emission right before , during or right after neutron star - neutron star mergers through a variety of physical mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may serve as an explanation @xcite for fast radio bursts ( frbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : impulsive ms bursts of dispersed radio emission with peak flux densities of @xmath2jy or more at 1.4ghz and apparently cosmological origins .    searches for prompt radio emission from grbs have been conducted for decades but most have concentrated on the more - common long - duration grbs ( lgrbs ) and/or not been very sensitive ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent discussions ) .",
    "observations that covered the times of the grbs were usually from less - sensitive all - sky instruments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while more sensitive pointed observations often took several minutes to slew before starting to observe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we instead take advantage of the capabilities of the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite )  a low frequency ( 80300mhz ) interferometer located in western australia  for rapid , sensitive followup . with fully - electronic steering and a wide field - of - view",
    ", it can respond to astrophysical transients within 20s of receiving an alert as we demonstrate below .    here",
    "we present a search for prompt low - frequency radio emission associated with the short - duration grb  150424a  using the mwa .",
    "grb  150424a  was detected on 2015 april 25 at 07:42:57ut by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on board the _ swift _  satellite @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-ray emission consists of multiple very bright pulses with a duration of about 0.5s , followed by weak @xmath3-ray emission up to 100s after the initial pulses @xcite .",
    "grb  150424a  is thus classified as a sgrb with extended emission ( ee sgrb ) : a small population of grbs whose properties are most consistent with sgrbs despite their long durations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and where the origin of the extended emission is still being debated but may involve a magnetar central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began observing the location of grb  150424a  87.9s after the burst and found a bright , fading x - ray source .",
    "followup observations @xcite identified a redshift @xmath4 galaxy @xmath5 ( projected separation of 22.5kpc ) away from the optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found a fainter potential host galaxy with a likely redshift of @xmath6 underlying the grb location .",
    "we note that the density of the medium surrounding this grb is unknown and , if high , may impede the detection of coherent radio emission @xcite .",
    "all cosmological quantities in this paper are computed based on @xcite .",
    "we use a nominal redshift of 0.7 for our calculations , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the mwa monitor and control computer received a socket - based notice from the gamma - ray coordinate network ( gcn ) at 07:43:10ut and quickly scheduled 30min of observations of grb  150424a . to save time , the telescope stayed in the same configuration as the previous observation which had been solar observing .",
    "this used an unusual configuration with the 24 coarse 1.28mhz channels spread out in a `` picket fence , '' mode , with 2.56mhz sub - bands spread between 80mhz and 240mhz ( and using 0.5s correlator integrations with 40khz frequency resolution ) .",
    "observations started at 07:43:20ut , 23s after the grb .",
    "this was during the day at the mwa ( sun at @xmath7 elevation ) and with the grb somewhat low in the sky ( elevation @xmath8 ) , although it was @xmath9 away from the sun . because of the low elevation the mwa had less sensitivity and a more irregular primary beam shape than usual .",
    "the observations consisted of 15 individual 112s scans , separated by 8s .",
    "the processing followed standard mwa procedures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we performed initial phase calibration using an observation of hydra  a taken earlier in the same day in the same mode .",
    "we then imaged the scans with @xmath10 @xmath11 pixels in the xx and yy instrumental polarizations using ` wsclean ` @xcite , using 40,000 ` clean ` iterations and allowing for one round of amplitude and phase self - calibration ( as demonstrated by @xcite , this does not remove transients as long as they do not dominate the total flux density of the image ) .",
    "finally , we corrected the instrumental polarization to stokes i ( total intensity ) using the primary beam from @xcite .",
    "the synthesized beam was elongated with an axis - ratio of 2.6:1 because of the low elevation ; the major axis varied from @xmath12 to @xmath13 over the different sub - bands .",
    "examining the images from the different sub - bands , the upper 6 sub - bands ( frequencies @xmath14mhz ) suffered significant image artifacts , mostly due to uncleaned sidelobes from hydra  a ( @xmath15 to the north west of grb  150424a ) and primary beam grating lobes that encompassed the sun .",
    "we ended up discarding the upper 6 sub - bands as we could not satisfactorily improve the image quality . for the remaining sub - bands",
    ", we combined individual 2min scans into a single 30min mosaic ( as in @xcite ) ; we show the mosaics for each sub - band in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the flux density scale was corrected so that the bright , unresolved source pks  j0949@xmath162511  ( @xmath17 away from grb ) averaged over each 2min observation matched the spectral energy distribution we interpolated from values from the nasa extragalactic database , given in table  [ tab : limits ] .",
    "we then also created images with 4s integration times , using the corrected @xmath18 data but only performing 100 ` clean ` iterations on each .",
    "l c c c c c c flux density of pks  j0949@xmath162511  ( jy ) & 22.5 & 21.8 & 21.1 & 20.1 & 19.1 & 17.9 + 4s flux density limits for grb  150424a  ( jy ) & 8.7 & 7.7 & 5.7 & 4.9 & 4.2 & 3.0 + 2min flux density limits for grb  150424a  ( jy ) & 3.5 & 1.9 & 3.0 & 2.4 & 1.0 & 1.1 + 30min flux density limits for grb  150424a  ( jy ) & 2.6 & 2.4 & 1.9 & 1.4 & 1.3 & 0.9    for each set of images : 4s , 2min , and 30min mosaics , we measured the flux density of pks  j0949@xmath162511  along with the flux density at the position of the grb ( position uncertainty @xmath19pixel ; we verified that the position variation of pks  j0949@xmath162511  due primarily to ionospheric refraction was @xmath20pixel ) and the image noise properties . in figure",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] we show the flux densities at the position of grb  150424a  for each sub - band from both the 4s and 2min images .",
    "there is some degree of correlation between individual points @xcite , but as a whole the data are noise - like with reduced @xmath21 values near 1 ( 0.760.98 depending on the band ) .",
    "we searched for statistically significant peaks in each of the sub - bands over a range of timescales from 4s2min and see nothing exceeding 3@xmath1 , much less anything that is correlated between the sub - bands ( with a possible delay allowing for interstellar dispersion ) .",
    "we then determined 3@xmath1 flux density limits , shown in figure  [ fig : limits ] and table  [ tab : limits ] .",
    "note that the 88.9 and 119.7mhz sub - bands are slightly anomalous in that the limits from the 30min mosaics are slightly worse than those from 2min images .",
    "this may be from a combination of source confusion limiting the sensitivity of the mosaics and residual poorly - cleaned sidelobes from hydra  a. as a whole , though , the 4s sub - bands behave well , and the limits from the longer integrations are lower , almost by the factor of 5 expected from the integration time .",
    "in our discussion of grb  150424a , we consider how our observations constrain the potentially related phenomena of sgrbs and frbs , and furthermore the implications of these results on low - frequency radio follow - up of gw transients . but first , we need to address the effects on any radio signal of propagation through intervening ionized media .      any prompt radio signal from grb  150424a",
    "is expected to be modified by its propagation through the interstellar medium ( ism ) of its host galaxy , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and the ism of the milky way @xcite .",
    "free electrons will introduce dispersion , causing lower frequencies to arrive later while inhomogeneities will cause scattering that smears out temporal structure .",
    "dispersion is quantified by the dispersion measure ( dm ) : the integral of the line - of - sight electron density .",
    "we can expect a dm of about 80@xmath0  from the milky way @xcite , and perhaps a roughly similar contribution from the grb s host galaxy .",
    "we expect the dm from the igm to be roughly @xmath22 for a redshift @xmath23 @xcite , so we can expect dm@xmath24@xmath01000@xmath0  depending on the actual redshift of the grb , and a total dm of 500@xmath01200@xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] we plot the time delays in each sub - band for a range of dms . even for the lowest possible dms ( just the milky way )",
    "our observing covered the delayed time of any prompt signal , especially in the lower sub - bands .",
    "our 30min observation spans the nominal dm range quite well , and we sample up to a dm of 2800@xmath0  for the lowest sub - band or 7700@xmath0  for the highest .",
    "note that the dispersion across a bandpass of 2.56mhz would last 9s40s depending on the sub - band for a nominal dm of 1000@xmath0 , so a fast pulse would last 210 of our 4s images .",
    "we assume that scattering does not significantly smear out any signal @xcite , but note that this may need to be revisited as more information is gained about frb behavior .",
    "given the observed sgrb , we can constrain any associated prompt , coherent radio signal such as those predicted in models of neutron star - neutron star mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or more generic grb phenomenon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these models have poorly - predicted efficiency factors which we are able to constrain directly from our observations .",
    "we show example predictions that have been adjusted to not exceed our 4s limits in figure  [ fig : limits ] . for the rapid magnetized spin - down model of @xcite ,",
    "we have spin - down luminosity @xmath25 and assume an efficiency scaling exponent @xmath26 , while for the similar but lower @xmath27 model of @xcite , we have efficiency @xmath28 , along with nominal magnetic field @xmath29 g and initial spin period @xmath30ms . and for coherent radio emission from the magnetized wind of a magnetar central engine colliding with the ambient medium as in @xcite , we have ratio of radio to @xmath3-ray fluence @xmath31 .",
    "note that our constraints here are for a fixed observed timescale of 4s , which limits the dm to 444@xmath0  for 133mhz observations . at higher dms",
    ", our constraints will scale up accordingly .",
    "these constraints will be explored further in rowlinson et al .",
    "( 2015b in prep ) . with a detection",
    "we can use the fluence , duration , and delay of any coherent emission to strongly constrain any model .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we compare our observations to other grb searches from the literature .",
    "to compare observations at a range of frequencies and timescales , we convert them to a common sensitivity assuming @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that sensitivity scales as @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 the integration time ) .",
    "we see that our limits are a factor of @xmath35100 deeper than those from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assuming no detections ) or @xcite , and cover far closer to the time of the grb than the former .",
    "some of the models for frbs tie them directly to neutron star - neutron star mergers and sgrbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite predict a frb when a magnetar central engine powering the grb collapses to form a black hole , which might happen at the end of the extended emission phase ( * ? ? ? * but see @xcite ) .",
    "since our observations cover from right after the grb ( allowing for dispersion ) to well past the end of the extended emission , we can place the first constraints on this model for the extended emission .    in our most sensitive sub - bands of 133mhz",
    ", we set a 3@xmath1 limit to the flux density of any short - duration emission of @xmath36jy .",
    "this translates into a fluence limit of @xmath37s , compared to frb fluences at 1.4ghz of @xmath38jyms to @xmath39jyms @xcite . assuming flux densities scale @xmath40",
    ", we can only exclude frbs with spectral indices @xmath41 .",
    "this is not particularly constraining ( unlike * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , largely because of the reduced sensitivity of the mwa at this low elevation ( cf .",
    "* ) and with the contribution of the sun to the system temperature .",
    "it is also possible that the 1.4-ghz frb detections have been aided by interstellar scintillation @xcite which would not help at these frequencies .",
    "finally , we can consider the constraints on gw transients .",
    "the aligo detectors were not operating during grb  150424a , so no direct gw limit can be determined , but we can consider the prospects for mwa followup of gw transients . as discussed in @xcite , the error regions for gw",
    "triggers in 20152016 can cover hundreds of square degrees .",
    "moreover , they need not be compact or simply connected . while the nominal field - of - view of the mwa is about @xmath42 at 150mhz , we can not always cover all of the expected error regions . unless the gw event occurs within the mwa s field - of - view ( chance of @xmath43% ) , we will need to re - point following a gw trigger .",
    "given the expected range of redshift / dm for gw events ( intergalactic dms of 1050@xmath0 , or total dms of 50200@xmath0 ) , we expect time delays from the gw event of only @xmath44s , not including possible internal delays @xcite . as we have demonstrated , 20s is sufficient for mwa followup , but the bigger question is the latency of the gw detection and notice .",
    "currently the low - latency compact binary coalescence pipeline is expected to send out notices with a time delay of 90120s after the gw event @xcite , although this could decrease as the signal - to - noise increases , with a detection potentially even occurring before the merger @xcite .",
    "although this can be mitigated at some level by moving to frequencies @xmath45mhz where the dispersive delay increases to surpass the gw event delay this delay may ultimately be a significant limitation for the prospects of prompt gw followup @xcite .",
    "if we are able to point appropriately , we expect a limiting flux density of about 0.1jy , or luminosity limits of @xmath46 for typical distances .",
    "since gw sources would be at redshifts @xmath47 compared to 0.31 here , any radio emission would be significantly brighter by a factor of 501000 .",
    "this would lead to much more realistically constraining models for frbs and sgrbs , with e.g. , @xmath48 from @xcite close to the value of @xmath49 seen for radio pulsars , or an @xmath50 from @xcite close to the range inferred from modeling extended emission in sgrbs @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated prompt followup with a pointed radio telescope that we have used to set stringent limits to any prompt , coherent emission from the short grb  150424a .",
    "looking on our fastest timescale of 4s , we set 3@xmath1 flux density limits of 3.0jy at 133mhz .",
    "these limits are a factor of @xmath51 lower that most prior limits , and cover delays of 23s30min after the grb , corresponding to dms of 1007700@xmath0 .",
    "we did not detect any frb coincident with the grb , but these limits are not very constraining compared to the population of frbs because of reduced sensitivity for this particular pointing .",
    "we plan to continue our grb followup program over the next year , although given the preferred elevation range of @xmath52 the rate of _ swift _  sgrbs suitable for mwa followup is @xmath53 .",
    "however , this serves as a demonstration and template analysis for future followup of gw transients  particularly timely given the very recent start of science runs with the aligo detectors .",
    "we will work to improve the analysis time for the mwa data to facilitate multi - wavelength followup over the large gw error regions @xcite .",
    "additional work in reducing the latency of the gw triggers will also be helpful since that is expected to be a limitation on the robustness of any conclusions from low - frequency radio searches .",
