    "in a previous measurement @xcite of the reaction @xmath0 , covering several backward - pion cm scattering angles and photon energies between 0.5 and 1.0 gev , a structure has been observed in the excitation function at @xmath4=130@xmath3 between 0.7 and 0.8 gev which could not be explained in terms of non - exotic mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , an approach including an intermediate on - shell @xmath1-meson rescattering ( which has been successful in describing a similar feature of the @xmath5 elastic backward excitation function @xcite ) might be able to account for such an enhancement around the @xmath1-photoproduction threshold .",
    "an intermediate on - shell @xmath2 formation should appear in the @xmath0 excitation function close to the @xmath2-photoproduction threshold @xcite .",
    "thus , if the finding in @xcite is confirmed , a detailed study of this process extended to higher beam energies and broader angular range may prove to be a valuable tool for studying @xmath1n and @xmath2n interactions , which is the goal of our efforts .",
    "the experiment was performed in hall b at jefferson lab using the clas detection system @xcite .",
    "electrons from the cebaf accelerator hit a thin gold radiator and produced a bremsstrahlung beam that was then incident on a 10-cm thick liquid - deuterium target .",
    "the energies of the incoming photons were measured directly with the hall - b photon tagger @xcite , whereas the reaction products were detected using clas .",
    "the intensity of the photon beam was @xmath610@xmath7 tagged photons / s and the generated luminosity was around @xmath8 s@xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "data were obtained for electron energies of 2.5 and 3.1 gev , which corresponds to photon energy ranges of 0.5 - 2.4 and 0.8 - 2.9 gev .",
    "the number of collected @xmath11 events was @xmath6@xmath12 and @xmath6@xmath13 for the two electron beam energies , respectively .",
    "since clas is very well suited for detecting charged particles and has limited acceptance for neutrals , our analysis is based on detecting the deuteron and applying the missing - mass technique to identify the reaction . the data were divided into 50-mev - wide photon - energy bins and 0.1- or 0.2- ( depending on the statistics ) wide cos@xmath14 bins . for each energy and angular bin ,",
    "background subtraction was done by fitting the background in the deuteron missing - mass - squared distribution and subtracting it from the total yield . in order to determine the detector acceptance ,",
    "10@xmath15 phase - space - distributed @xmath11 events were generated and processed through the geant - based simulation code gsim @xcite and the same analysis chain as the data .",
    "the acceptance varies between 40@xmath16 and 70@xmath16 , depending on the beam energy and cm scattering angle .",
    "roughly estimated , the acceptance systematic uncertainty is at the level of 10@xmath16 .",
    "preliminary cross sections were extracted by normalizing the yields to the photon flux and the number of target nuclei , and applying an acceptance correction .",
    "after analyzing the 2.5-gev data set , we were able to extract preliminary differential cross sections up to a photon energy of 1.2 gev for backward - pion cm scattering angles and up to 2.0 gev for forward angles .",
    "the most backward - pion cm scattering angle accessible in our data is 148@xmath3 and is defined by the forward hole in clas . the most forward accessible cm angle varies between 32@xmath3 and 76@xmath3 , depending on the beam energy , and is limited by the detector energy acceptance for deuterons .    our preliminary results for several pion cm scattering angles , compared with previous measurements ,",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : yilieva_fig1 ] . the uncertainties shown are statistical ( 3 - 12@xmath16 ) and systematic due to background subtraction ( up to 3@xmath16 ) added in quadrature .",
    "fairly good agreement with the previous data is observed .",
    "all excitation functions corresponding to @xmath17123@xmath3 show a structure around the @xmath1-production threshold , which becomes more prominent as the cm angle increases .",
    "this confirms the finding reported in @xcite .",
    "however , the shape of the structure we see is somewhat different compared with the results of the previous measurement : at @xmath4=130@xmath3 our data show an enhancement around 0.7 gev , whereas the data from @xcite show a broad plateau between 0.7 and 0.8 gev . in order to understand this difference we are currently in the process of a detailed analysis of the systematics of our experiment . due to statistics limitations",
    ", we might not be able to study the effect of an intermediate on - shell @xmath2-state .",
    "obtained with the clas detector ( solid symbols ) .",
    "previous data @xcite are also shown ( open symbols ) .",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath2-photoproduction thresholds are indicated by arrows . ]",
    "the reaction @xmath0 was measured at photon beam energies above 0.5 gev .",
    "this is the first detailed measurement of that process spanning wide ranges in energy and angle . at photon energies and cm angles where there are existing data , our preliminary cross sections are in good agreement with the previous measurements @xcite .",
    "we confirm the existence of a structure in the excitation function at @xmath4=130@xmath3 close to the @xmath1-photoproduction threshold .",
    "moreover , our data extend to larger cm angles where the structure is clearly more prominent .",
    "an approach including intermediate on - shell @xmath1-meson formation @xcite will be used to describe the data in order to study the properties of the @xmath1n interaction .",
