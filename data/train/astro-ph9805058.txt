    "the colours calculated for stars later than mid a - type are affected by treatment of convection .",
    "small systematic errors were found in the colours calculated using atlas6 ( kurucz , 1979 ) , which could be due to convection or missing opacity in the models ( relyea & kurucz , 1978 ) .",
    "recent improvements in opacity in atlas9 models ( kurucz , 1991 ) ought to ensure that opacity is now a less dominant source of the discrepancies .",
    "this leaves convection as a possible source of the discrepancies .",
    "we have compared mixing length theory ( see castelli et al . , 1997 ) with the turbulent convection model of canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "the atlas9 code was used to calculate @xmath0 colours .",
    "the computations were identical , except for treatment of convection .",
    "we considered three cases :    1 .   mixing - length theory with approximate overshooting ( mlt_ov ) , 2 .   mixing - length theory without approximate overshooting ( mlt_noov ) , 3 .",
    "the kupka ( 1996 ) implementation of the canuto & mazzitelli theory ( cm ) .",
    "here we present a summary of the main findings from the comparisons between the three treatments of convection outlined above .",
    "full details can be found in smalley & kupka ( 1997 ) .",
    "the ultimate test of any model colours is to compare them to the colours of stars whose atmospheric parameters have been obtained from direct , model - independent methods .",
    "the fundamental stars presented by smalley & dworetsky ( 1995 ) were used to test the colours obtained from the three grids .",
    "we adopted the following methodology in the testing procedure : the observed @xmath0 photometry of the fundamental star was de - reddened using moon s ( 1985 ) uvbybeta programme .",
    "for each grid in turn , values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 were obtained by interpolation within the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) colour grid .",
    "we then compared either @xmath1 or @xmath2 with the corresponding fundamental value .",
    "this way we could compare @xmath1 and @xmath2 independently , since very few stars have fundamental values for both parameters .    figure  1 shows the comparison between the fundamental @xmath1 values and those obtained from the 3 grids .",
    "the cm model gives the best agreement .",
    "the mlt_noov grid is somewhat discrepant , but still within the error bars .",
    "the mlt_ov grid is widely discrepant .",
    "figure  2 shows the comparison between the fundamental @xmath2 values and those obtained from the 3 grids .",
    "there is little difference between cm and mlt_noov grids , but mlt_ov grid is clearly discrepant .",
    "however , the cm models give less scatter and no hint of a possible systematic trend at low @xmath1 observed in the mlt_noov models .    from the comparisons with fundamental stars we find that the cm grids give the best agreement .",
    "the mlt_noov grids are only marginally less successful in recovering the fundamental values .",
    "the mlt_ov grids are however significantly discrepant .",
    "since there are very few stars with fundamental values of @xmath1 or @xmath2 , the comparisons were also performed using non - fundamental stars .",
    "whilst this allows for significantly more stars in the comparisons , there is a very real danger that model - dependent systematic errors could bias any result .",
    "however , similar results were found using stars which have values of @xmath1 obtained using the infrared flux method ( blackwell & lynas - gray 1994 ) , once known spectroscopic binaries had been excluded .",
    "open cluster stars can be used as surface gravity standards by fitting evolutionary models to the cluster photometry . in this case",
    "the stellar interior calculations can be influenced by the treatment of convection ( e.g. stothers & chin 1995 , canuto et al . 1996 ) . nevertheless , similar results were found for hyades stars with @xmath2 obtained from evolutionary models .",
    "overall , the cm model has the greatest success in recovering the @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained from both fundamental and non - fundamental methods .",
    "however , the mlt_noov grids are only marginally less successful than the cm grids .",
    "the mlt_ov grids are clearly discrepant .",
    "the colours of late - a and f stars can be significantly affected by metallicity , due to the vast amount of metal lines .",
    "the @xmath5 metallicity index can be used to estimate [ m / h ] in late - a and f stars , usually via empirical relations ( smalley 1993 ) .    in all the three cases considered here ,",
    "the theoretical @xmath5 values are found to be discrepant .",
    "none of the model results based on the different convection treatments agrees completely with the standard main - sequence reference line , and all are discrepant for late - type stars .",
    "the problem may not be due to convection alone , but could be related to microturbulence ( smalley & kupka 1997 ) , because microturbulence is probably closely related to the small - scale part of the photospheric convective flow ( holweger & strenburg 1993 ) .",
    "investigations into the causes of this discrepancy are being undertaken .",
    "from a comparison with the observed @xmath0 colours , we have found that the cm grid gives results that are generally superior to those with mlt theory without overshooting ( mlt_noov ) .",
    "models with overshooting ( mlt_ov ) are found to be clearly discrepant ."
