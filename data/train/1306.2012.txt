    "since @xmath264 and @xmath265 , we have that @xmath266 for @xmath3 sufficiently large , by definition of @xmath96 .",
    "lemma  [ sumcor2 ] applies and gives an upper bound @xmath267 now @xmath268 , which leads to @xmath269 if @xmath270 then the lower bound given by lemma  [ sumcor2 ] is the same as the upper bound ( [ upper ] ) , within the stated error term , establishing the result in this case .",

    "then ( [ l - rev ] ) shows that @xmath272 if @xmath273 then @xmath274 and hence @xmath275 , so in this case the trivial lower bound of 1 matches the upper bound ( [ upper ] ) , within the stated error term .",
    "if @xmath276 then using ( [ lrat ] ) with @xmath277 , we obtain @xmath278 since here @xmath279 , this expression matches the upper bound ( [ upper ] ) , within the stated error term .",
