    "in this paper we revisit the calculation of the two photon width of @xmath0 , highlighting newest experimental results and updating the potential model calculation .",
    "this allows for a reliable estimate of the two photon width of @xmath1 , which is been searched for in @xmath4 collisions @xcite .",
    "we shall see that the expected two photon width of @xmath1 is within reach of the precision in the lep data being analyzed .",
    "the charmonium spectrum has been the basic testing grounds for a variety of models for the interquark potential , ever since the discovery of the @xmath5 in 1974 @xcite .",
    "the experimental scenario describing the @xmath6 bound states is close to completion , with the observed higher excitation states @xmath7 , @xmath8 and spin 2 @xmath9 states @xcite : decay widths into various leptonic and hadronic states have been measured and compared with potential models @xcite .",
    "most of this note is dedicated to examine the theoretical predictions for the electromagnetic decay of the simplest and lowest lying of all the charmonium states , i.e. the pseudoscalar @xmath0 . in sect .",
    "2 we shall compare the two photon decay width with the leptonic width of the @xmath5 , which has been measured with higher precision @xcite and found to be 15% higher than in previous measurements @xcite .",
    "this implies that a number of potential models whose parameters had been determined by the leptonic width of the @xmath5 may need some updating , and so do some predictions from these models .",
    "potential model predictions for @xmath10 can be found in sect .",
    "3 , together with a value for the two photon width of @xmath1 extracted from the coulombic potential . in sect .",
    "4 we show the predictions for @xmath0 decay widths , using the procedure introduced in  @xcite for the description of mesons made out of two non relativistic heavy quarks , by means of the non relativistic quantum chromodynamics  nrqcd . in sect .",
    "5 we compare these different determinations with the experimental value of the @xmath11 decay width expanding some recent theoretical analyses on this subject ( see for instance  @xcite ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first evidence of the @xmath0 state has been found in the inclusive photon spectra of the @xmath12 and @xmath3 decays  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , through @xmath13 collisions , the decay width of @xmath0 into two photons has been measured in different experiments .",

    "this estimate agrees within @xmath21 with the value given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : etactogamgam ] ) .",
    "here we assumed the @xmath17 scale to be @xmath22 .",

    "any given model , sources of error in this calculation arise from the choice of scale in the radiative correction factor and the choice of the parameters .",

    "predictions of course will be affected by the error due to the parametric dependence of the given potential model , an error which can be quite large since most of the parameters have been tuned with the charmonium system . on the other hand , the coulombic",
    "potential gives results for the charmonium system in agreement with all the other models , and , at the same time , is relatively free of such parameter dependence . with only the scale of @xmath20 in the wave function to worry about , it can be used for a reliable estimate . for this purpose",
    "we shall make use of the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : widsc1l ] ) where this time @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "we will present now another model which admits other components to the meson decay beyond the one from the colour singlet picture ( bodwin , braaten and lepage )  @xcite .",
    "nrqcd has been used to separate the short distance scale of annihilation from the nonperturbative contributions of long distance scale .",
    "this model has been successfully used to explain the larger than expected @xmath3 production at the tevatron and lep . according to bbl , in the octet model for quarkonium ,",

    "this result in turn is used to compute the @xmath2 decay widths .",
    "the bbl model gives the following decay widths of the @xmath2 meson : ( _ c ) = 9.02 0.65 0.14 and ( _ clh ) = 14.38 1.07 1.43 where the first error comes from the uncertainty on the @xmath3 experimental width , the second error from @xmath20  .",
    "this results agree with experimental data within @xmath49 , confirming the applicability of the bbl model to the charm system .",

    "the advantage of this method is that we are giving a prediction from first principles , without using any experimental input .",
    "the second evaluation , given by bbl using the experimental values of the @xmath3 decay , is off by 1@xmath51 from the central value .",
    "this is true also for the determination of the bbl model with nonperturbative long distance terms taken from from the lattice calculation  @xcite , affected from a large error .",
    "the advantage of the latter is that its prediction , like the one from potential models , does not make use of any experimental value . next is the point given by the singlet picture from the electromagnetic decay of the @xmath3 , in agreement with the central value of the @xmath2 .",
    "the last point is obtained also from the singlet picture with the @xmath3 decay into light hadrons , and is in disagreement with the experimental measure .",
