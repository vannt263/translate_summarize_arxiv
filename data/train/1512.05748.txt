    "the study of neutrino interactions presents unique challenges . unlike for its electroweak counterpart , the charged lepton , the energy of a neutrino is generally difficult to measure .",
    "existing accelerator technologies are able to provide a neutrino beam with a well defined direction , and yet the beam energy spectrum , which is of critical importance in neutrino oscillation analyses  @xcite , is not well known . with a nuclear target , where neutrinos interact with bound nucleons , uncertainties from various nuclear effects arise . with accelerator neutrinos in the gev regime ,",
    "individual bound nucleons are resolved .",
    "their momenta , due to fermi motion ranging up to @xmath0  mev/@xmath1 , need to be considered ; the energy required to release one of them ( binding energy ) causes further fluctuations in the initial kinematics .",
    "moreover , multinucleon correlations have recently been conjectured to contribute significantly to the measured cross sections in this energy regime , evoking a reexamination of the long - used impulse approximation  @xcite . because the hadronic final states are produced inside a nuclear medium ",
    "the nucleus containing nucleons undergoing fermi motion ",
    "they experience final - state interactions ( fsis ) before exiting and therefore both their kinematics and identity can be altered . in response to this",
    ", the nucleus can be excited or it can break up , emitting nucleons , pions and photons  collectively known as _ nuclear emission_.",
    "these effects further modify the final states from the _ basic _ neutrino - nucleon interaction , which could have already been biased by multinucleon correlations , and introduce ambiguities , in both measurements and calculation , to efforts to identify the interaction channel .",
    "the highly convoluted nature of the problem is made manifest by the fact that these nuclear effects are all present in different channels for all nuclei except hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "experimental efforts to understand charged - current ( cc ) neutrino - nucleus interactions , on which spectrum measurements of accelerator neutrinos are based , have been focused on inclusive and semi - inclusive observables , such as total cross sections and lepton kinematics , which depend strongly on the neutrino energy and can not be directly compared across experiments because the neutrinos are produced in wideband fluxes . to interpret the data , theories of the basic interactions and nuclear effects have to be folded into approximated neutrino energy spectra .",
    "therefore , on one hand , accessing the nuclear effects precisely is difficult , while on the other hand , understanding the nuclear effects helps determine the spectra .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that , with moderate fsis , the calorimetric approach of neutrino energy reconstruction outperforms kinematic methods ; yet models of fsis have not been extensively tested because of the lack of measurements of the final - state hadrons .    in this work",
    ", we propose to measure nuclear effects via the transverse kinematic imbalance between the charged lepton and the primary final - state hadron in an exclusive cc channel , such as quasielastic scattering ( qe ) and resonance production ( res ) .",
    "the measurement in res is especially important for a better understanding of nuclear effects in both neutrino and antineutrino interactions .",
    "our discussion starts with the impulse approximation .",
    "we will first demonstrate the minimal dependence of hadronic variables on the neutrino energy , and describe the nuclear medium response to fsis .",
    "then we illustrate how these variables are affected by fermi motion and fsis .",
    "subsequently the issue with respect to multinucleon correlations and an extension of the technique to electron - nucleus scattering will be addressed briefly .",
    "consider a cc interaction on a nucleus . at the basic level the neutrino @xmath2",
    "interacts with a bound nucleon @xmath3 which then transits to another hadronic state @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the charged lepton . in the rest frame of the nucleus ,",
    "the bound nucleon is subject to fermi motion with momentum @xmath7 , and an energy - momentum @xmath8 carried by a virtual @xmath9-boson ( @xmath10 ) is transferred to it as the neutrino scatters . in characterizing the interaction , the virtuality @xmath11 and the invariant mass @xmath12 of @xmath4",
    "following energy - momentum conservation ( the binding energy is neglected compared to the initial nucleon energy  @xcite ) , the energy transfer reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of @xmath3 , and the last line follows from averaging out the direction of @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ eq : polarization ] , which is a first order approximation because the _ polarization _ term @xmath15 with opposite orientations of @xmath7 for a give @xmath16 does not exactly cancel as the @xmath10-@xmath3 cross section is slightly different with the varying center - of - mass energy  @xcite .",
    "below the deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) region  especially in qe and res where @xmath12 equals the nucleon and dominantly the @xmath17 resonance mass , respectively ",
    "the cross section is suppressed when @xmath18 is larger than the nucleon mass . the hadron momentum in these channels , as indicated by eq .",
    "[ eq : etrans ] ,  saturates \" if the neutrino energy is above the scale @xmath19 beyond which the charged lepton retains most of the increase of the neutrino energy .",
    "once the final state hadron @xmath4 is produced , it starts to propagate through the nuclear medium  @xcite . under the assumption that the basic interaction ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ccintele ] ) and the in - medium propagation are uncorrelated ( i.e. , are _ factorized _ ) , the momentum of @xmath4 , which depends weakly on the neutrino energy , completely determines the medium response , including the in - medium interaction probability @xmath20  @xcite and the energy - momentum transfer @xmath21 to the medium ( if @xmath4 decays inside the nucleus , the total effect of all decay products is considered ) .",
    "it is the latter that leads to nuclear excitation  @xcite or break - up and consequently nuclear emission . the nuclear emission probability , @xmath22 , correlates the medium response to the in - medium energy - momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "the factorization assumption suggests that @xmath22 is independent of the neutrino energy @xmath23 , which is consistent with the implementation in the nuwro  @xcite simulation shown in fig .",

    "to make a neutrino energy - independent measurement of nuclear effects , the in - medium energy - momentum transfer ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) would be the ideal observable ; this however is not experimentally accessible because of the unknown initial nucleon momentum and the initially unknown neutrino energy .",

    "if fsis could be switched off , @xmath30 and @xmath31 would be the transverse projection of @xmath7 and of the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , to first approximation , the distribution of @xmath30 would be independent of the neutrino energy , and that of @xmath31 would be flat due to the isotropy of fermi motion .",
    "the fsi acceleration ( deceleration ) of the propagating @xmath4 adds in a smearing to @xmath32 and pushes @xmath30 forward ( backward ) to @xmath33 , making @xmath34 ( 180 ) degrees .",

    "can be inferred by its more pronunced upper tail in the distribution .     in qe and @xmath56 ( p@xmath57 ) production .",
    "nominal genie events that experienced proton and pion elastic fsi are removed stepwise to separate the effects ; similar features are also exhibited in the p@xmath58 and p@xmath59 channels . ]    another interesting example from the transverse kinematic imbalance in res is the pauli blocking of the resonance decay product . if it does not affect the resonance momentum",

    "so far the discussion only considers the in - medium energy - momentum transfer and nuclear emission that are induced by fsis . in reality ,",
    "multinucleon correlations in the initial state could have significant impact in both processes that are however non - distinguishable from being fsi - induced on an event - by - event basis .",
    "their contribution to the kinematic imbalance results in an additional convolution to each of the single transverse variables .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath31 distributions  especially in the regions beyond the fermi momentum and around the backward peak , respectively  may therefore provide a kinematic constraint on the multinucleon correlations .",
    "furthermore , because the nuclear emission probability is enhanced , its correlations against the single transverse variables may be of interest to provide sensitive signatures .",
    "in general , samples of qe and res can be produced by selecting events with at least one proton and no pion , and at least one proton and one pion , respectively , in a cc inclusive sample .",
    "neutrino energy - dependent contamination comes from other channels where incomplete final states are selected .",
    "in addition , because of their intrinsic kinematic imbalance , such non - exclusive backgrounds mimic the exclusive signals that experience fsis and/or multinucleon correlations .",
    "however , quantitatively they may behavior differently : because of the characteristic strengths of the imbalance , one would expect that the single - transverse variables from the background , the signal with fsis , and that with multinucleon correlations form a certain ordering , based on which it might be possible to perform efficient channel purification and nuclear effect identification .",
    "the observation of the transverse kinematic imbalance relies on the momentum reconstruction of both leptonic and hadronic final states .",
    "since the @xmath30 distributions reveal nuclear effects including fermi motion , deflection and acceleration / deceleration in fsi , efforts in improving the momentum and angular resolution , as well as in understanding the momentum scales of the final - state lepton , proton and pion might be needed for current experiemnts .",
    "experiments with trackers , for example t2k  @xcite and miner@xmath2a  @xcite , might be capable to perform pioneering measurements to validate the different model predictions presented in the previous section .",
    "the prospect in miner@xmath2a with its multiple - type nuclear targets is of special interest because the transverse kinematic imbalance would directly show the evolution of the nuclear effects as the target type varies .    throughout this work",
    ", it is emphasized that the equivalence between nuclear effects and transverse kinematic imbalance is invariant with the neutrino energy .",
    "in fact this equivalence is invariant with _ all _ physics at the neutrino - nucleon interaction level . in analogue to the minimal neutrino energy dependence , transverse kinematic imbalances are also minimally influenced by nucleon level model uncertainties , such as the details of the nucleon form factors ( fig .  [ fig : maqe ] ) .",
    "this further reduces the uncertainties in measuring nuclear effects .",

    "in such a case , as the electron beam energy is well known , the energy imbalance between the initial and final states can also be studied .",
    "in this work , for a measurement of nuclear effects independent of the neutrino energy , transverse kinematic imbalance has been systematically examined .",
    "its novel application to the resonance production is important for experiments with high energy neutrinos produced in the numi and lbnf  @xcite beam lines because of the significant production cross section ; it is also unique for the study of nuclear effects in antineutrino interactions where the final - state neutrons in quasielastic scattering can not usually be measured .",
    "an extension of the single - transverse kinematics in the resonance production is the double - transverse momentum imbalance  @xcite , which is defined on the axis perpendicular to both the neutrino and charged lepton momenta , with a sensitivity to the difference between the proton and pion fsis .",
