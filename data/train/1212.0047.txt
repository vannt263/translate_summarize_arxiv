    "from the time when it was revealed that the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems promise significant gains , which had never been achievable with any advanced single - antenna systems , in the spectral efficiency and the reliability of communication systems , the mimo systems have been intensively studied in many different perspectives @xcite . in recent years , along with the advances in implementation technologies , the implementation and deployment of mimo systems have become active research topics .",
    "for example , advanced space - time coding techniques are being adopted by the standards of modern communication systems , such as high - throughput wireless lan ( ieee 802.11n ) and 3gpp long term evolution . in particular ,",
    "very large mimo systems @xcite , also known as massive mimo , are currently being studied to meet the increasing needs for high - efficiency , green communication systems .",
    "basically , most of these mimo technologies are based on the premise that the capacity and diversity gains are improved with the increasing number of antennas .    in a number of early studies on the mimo fading channel ,",
    "the rich scattering environment was often assumed and the channel was modeled as a random matrix with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) elements , each of which represents the fading channel coefficient between transmit and receive antennas . in the landmark work by telatar @xcite",
    ", it was shown that , for the mimo channel with i.i.d .",
    "fading , the channel capacity grows linearly with the numbers of the transmit and receive antennas .",
    "in much subsequent work followed , the i.i.d .",
    "mimo channel was thoroughly studied and lots of insight on the mimo system was gained . in particular , many space - time coding schemes were designed based on the understanding of i.i.d .",
    "mimo channel model @xcite .",
    "however , in the real applications , the i.i.d .",
    "mimo channel model has very limited importance because the scattering environment is rarely rich enough and the channel coefficients are correlated @xcite . to address the requirements for more realistic mimo channel models ,",
    "the kronecker model was introduced @xcite . in this model ,",
    "correlation between channel coefficients is posed by multiplying transmit and receive correlation matrices on the right and left of a matrix of i.i.d .",
    "things become more complicated than the i.i.d . case , but it was shown in @xcite that the capacity of the kronecker model still grows in proportion to the number of transmit and receive antennas .",
    "that is , the correlation introduced in the kronecker model only impacts the rate of growth of the capacity , not the linearity itself .",
    "though the kronecker model facilitates the capacity analysis through the powerful random matrix theory , it fails to capture the dependence between the transmit and receive correlation characteristics and has also proven to be inconsistent with measurement results @xcite .",
    "recently , efforts were made to incorporate more physical natures of scattering into channel modeling . in the literature related to physical channel modeling @xcite",
    ", it was stated that , while the transmit and receive signals can be described by the excitation current distribution on antenna arrays ( _ array domain _ ) , the propagation environment can be better explained in the _ angular domain _ in terms of the strength of the electromagnetic fields radiated from or impinging on the arrays .",
    "the two domains are convertible to each other through an appropriate transform determined by the geometry of the arrays . in particular , for linear arrays , the mapping between them is given by the fourier transform , and there exists an analogy between the time - frequency domain and angle - array domain pairs .",
    "given spatial distributions of scatterers , the electromagnetic fields at the transmit and receive sides are related in the angular domain through the _ green function _ , and the joint response between them , in terms of the angles of arrival and departure , is given by a scattering response function ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "simplified angular domain channel models were presented based on discrete antennas and discrete scattered paths .",
    "though many insightful observations were made from the discrete path modeling , it is less realistic because the scattered paths are often continuously dispersed and clustered in many practical situations such as urban and indoor environments .",
    "also , for the angular domain channel model , it was shown in @xcite that putting more antennas in a fixed array aperture does not always bring increasing gains due to increased correlation between channel coefficients . instead , it was observed that the size of the array aperture is more important than the number of antennas and , thus , in @xcite , the notion of a continuous array , which corresponds to the infinite number of infinitesimally - spaced antennas packed in a given aperture , was adopted .",
    "based on this model , the intrinsic channel characteristics independent of the antenna configuration , such as the capacity and the diversity , were derived as functions of the aperture size and the total angular spread of scattering clusters . in particular , in @xcite , three different mechanisms of scattering , i.e. , specular reflection , single - bounce diffuse scattering , and multi - bounce diffuse scattering , were introduced and their individual impacts were analyzed .",
    "[ t ]    [ t ]    in this paper , we focus on another intrinsic characteristic of the channel , which has not been addressed in existing literature ; the correlation in the scattering response function .",
    "the clusters of scatteres are often composed of a large but finite number of scattering objects .",
    "though the scattered fields by a single object can be statistically correlated @xcite , due to the limited spatial resolution of the arrays , only combined and smoothed effects of the fields that are scattered by multiple scatterers in the resolvable angle are observed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arraylowresol ] .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the scattering response is given by an uncorrelated ( or white ) gaussian random process in the angular domain as in @xcite , based on the central limit theorem .",
    "however , when we are concerned with a very large array , the spatial resolution can be so high that only a few objects falls into the resolvable angle as in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrayhighresol ] .",
    "in such a case , the uncorrelated scattering model seems no longer plausible and some correlation characteristics may need to be appended to the conventional model . for this purpose , we consider a simple correlated scattering model based on the notion of bandlimited white gaussian random process . for the sake of distinction",
    ", we refer to the conventional uncorrelated scattering model in @xcite as the white scattering model , and our correlated scattering model as the colored scattering model .    in section [ sec :",
    "scatteringmodel ] , we first introduce the colored scattering model and justify it compared to the conventional white scattering model . assuming multi - bounce diffuse scattering , section [ sec : spectraldecomp ] provides a canonical representation for the colored scattering response by the spectral decomposition technique .",
    "also , section [ sec : capbound ] shows how the channel is divided into subchannels with linear transmit and receive arrays .",
    "the key tools used in sections [ sec : spectraldecomp ] and [ sec : capbound ] are the karhunen - love theorem @xcite and prolate spheroidal wave functions @xcite .",
    "they have been widely used in the analysis of time- and bandlimited signals , either deterministic or random , and can be directly applied to the analysis of the scattering response due to the analogy .",
    "that is , the counterparts of time- and bandlimited signals in the time - frequency domains are the array aperture- or correlation- , and angular spread - limited responses in the angle - array domains .",
    "based on the decomposed subchannel model and assuming the fast - fading channel , the ergodic capacity is derived .",
    "it is shown that , for a given signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the pre - log factor of the ergodic capacity , which is also known as the number of degrees of freedom , is bounded by the product of the array length and total angular spread .",
    "this is consistent with the previous result for the white scattering model in @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the previous case , an interesting observation is made for the colored scattering model that the number of degrees of freedom is saturated to a certain value determined by the correlation characteristic of the channel .",
    "similarly in @xcite , it has already been shown that the degrees of freedom is saturated to the number of discrete and independent propagation paths in the channel .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between the two saturation phenomena since the scattering response is assumed to be clustered rather than discrete in this paper . to verify the theoretic result derived in section [ sec : capbound ] , a mimo system with discrete antennas",
    "is considered in section [ sec : numericalresult ] , and its capacity bounds are numerically computed in the colored scattering environment .",
    "the numerical results show that the capacity bounds do not linearly increase with the array size but eventually get saturated to certain values .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] discusses extensions of the result of this paper .",
    "though multi - bounce diffuse scattering , linear arrays , and fast - fading are mainly assumed in the analysis of this paper , some extensions to the other situations , such as single - bounce diffuse scattering and slow - fading , are straightforward .",
    "also , some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the following notations are used throughout this paper .",
    "the dirac delta function is denoted by @xmath5 and , for integers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the kronecker delta is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the sinc function @xmath10 .",
    "vectors or matrices are denoted by boldface symbols and the superscripts @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 denote conjugate , transpose , and conjugate transpose , respectively .",
    "the determinant and trace of a square matrix @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 , respectively , and @xmath17 is the identity matrix of the appropriate size .",
    "the sets of real and complex numbers are denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . for real numbers",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 $ ] is the closed interval @xmath24 . the statistical expectation is denoted by @xmath25 and , for a set @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes the lebesgue measure .",
    "@xmath28 , with no indicated base , denotes the logarithm of base 2 and the natural logarithm is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "finally , @xmath30 is the standard little - o notation .",
    "to focus on the intrinsic characteristics of the channel , we consider the continuous array model as in @xcite , which yields results not depending on the array configuration , such as the number and positions of the antennas .",
    "thus , the conventional discrete antenna model can be seen as a sampled version of the continuous array model .",
    "more specifically , we assume linear arrays of length @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are normalized to the wavelength , at the transmitter and the receiver , respectively . at the transmitter and the receiver ,",
    "we indicate specific positions on the arrays by scalar coordinate variables @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] , respectively .",
    "then , for a narrow band transmit signal , which is represented by a current distribution @xmath35 on the transmit array , the received signal , which is also represented by a current distribution @xmath36 on the receive array , is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the channel response and @xmath39 is the zero - mean white gaussian noise process with an autocorrelation function ( acf ) @xmath40 for @xmath41 $ ] . at the transmitter ,",
    "the transmit power constraint is imposed as @xmath42 physically , the channel response is modeled as a cascade of the transmit array response @xmath43 , the scattering response @xmath44 , and the receive array response @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are directional cosines for the transmit and receive arrays , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 is physically meaningful only for @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] and vanishes for other values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in far - field scattering , where the scatterers are sufficiently far from both the transmitter and the receiver , the array responses of the linear arrays are given by    @xmath51    note that , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are variables in the angular domain , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 are variables in the array domain . as mentioned in the introduction , the main benefit of assuming linear arrays is that the mapping between the array and angular domains is done by the fourier transform , which greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "hence , an equivalent angular domain representation of the relationship in ( [ eq : rxsigarray ] ) is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are fourier transform pairs of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "that is ,    @xmath58    and @xmath59 in ( [ eq : rxsigangle ] ) , we can observe the convolution operations with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which operate as low - pass filters . in other words , the transmit and received signals are smoothed in the angular domain due to the finite apertures of the arrays . as noted in the literature @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , those smoothing operations are closely related to the notion of spatial resolution of the arrays . as the array sizes @xmath31 and @xmath32 grows , the smoothing functions have narrower main lobes , which leads to the higher resolution for paths in the angular domain . note that the convolution between @xmath61 and @xmath55 in ( [ eq : rxsigangle ] ) is redundant because @xmath55 in ( [ eq : txsigangle ] ) is smoothed by construction due to the finite - length transmit array .",
    "nevertheless , we will not leave it out for later convenience .",
    "now , let us establish the characteristics of the scattering response @xmath44 . in the clustered scattering environment ,",
    "the scattering response is modeled as a continuous random process .",
    "the support of the scattering response , on which the response may have nonzero values , is determined by the placement of scattering clusters . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] , we suppose that there are @xmath62 and @xmath63 disjoint clusters seen at the transmit and receive arrays , respectively . at the transmit side , the angular subintervals of @xmath47 subtended by the scattering clusters are denoted by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and the union of the subintervals is defined as @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , at the receive side , the angular subintervals of @xmath48 are denoted by @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and the union of the subinterval is defined as @xmath69 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the statistical characteristics of the scattering response depend on the scattering mechanisms , such as specular reflection , single - bounce diffuse scattering , and multi - bounce diffuse scattering .",
    "in particular , the specular reflection is deterministic in nature , and the responses for diffuse scattering are assumed to be zero - mean white ( uncorrelated ) random processes with an acf @xmath70 where the support is @xmath71 for multi - bounce diffuse scattering and @xmath72 for single - bounce diffuse scattering ( @xmath73 ) . elsewhere outside of the support ,",
    "the scattering response is always zero .",
    "though it has been quite often subsumed in the literature @xcite , the validity of the above white scattering model for diffuse scattering is somewhat suspicious . in @xcite ,",
    "the correlation functions of electromagnetic fields scattered by random objects or rough surfaces were studied .",
    "the overall correlation function for a scattering cluster can be characterized by superposing the contributions of the constituent objects . however , when there is a huge number of scattering objects in the cluster , finding the exact correlation function for the cluster is almost impractical . moreover , since the spatial resolution of the arrays is limited in practice , only smoothed effects of those scattered fields are observable as shown in ( [ eq : rxsigangle ] ) and fig . [",
    "fig : arraylowresol ] .",
    "therefore , it seems rather acceptable to assume that the scattering response is a white random process and the observed channel response is gaussian distributed with zero - mean by the central limit theorem . in terms of the number of degrees of freedom of random processes , white random processes have an infinite number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "how many of those degrees of freedom can actually be used is solely determined by the spatial resolution of the array .",
    "it follows that the number of usable degrees of freedom increases linearly with the array sizes @xcite .",
    "depending on the composition of the scattering clusters and the array resolution , this may be true to some extent .",
    "however , though it could be very large , the number of scattering objects in each cluster is finite in practice .",
    "moreover , as we increase the array size , we may reach a point at which the spatial resolution of the array is comparable to the angular interval subtended by a single scattering object as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrayhighresol ] . at this point",
    ", the correlation of scattered fields can be captured by the array and the white scattering model may no longer be reasonable . instead , as a generalization of the white scattering model , we assume that scattering response is a zero - mean proper gaussian random process with @xmath74 where the support is given by ( [ eq : multidiffsupport ] ) or ( [ eq : singlediffsupport ] ) depending on whether it is multi - bounce or single - bounce diffuse scattering . the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 are referred to as the correlation widths at the transmitter and the receiver , respectively , and determines the extent of correlation in the angular domain .",
    "in contrast to the acf of the white random process ( [ eq : whitediff ] ) , the acf ( [ eq : coloreddiff ] ) corresponds to that of a bandlimited white random process @xcite .",
    "note that the acf ( [ eq : coloreddiff ] ) approaches to that of the white scattering ( [ eq : whitediff ] ) as @xmath75 and @xmath76 tend to zero .",
    "therefore , the new model includes the white scattering model as a special case . in distinction from the white scattering model",
    ", we refer to the scattering model with the acf ( [ eq : coloreddiff ] ) as _ the colored scattering model_. for notational simplicity , we denote the acf ( [ eq : coloreddiff ] ) as @xmath77 where    @xmath78    for @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the multi - bounce case and @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath65 , in the single - bounce case , and    @xmath83    for @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the multi - bounce case and @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath65 , in the single - bounce case . in the remainder of this paper , ( [ eq : txcorr ] ) and ( [ eq : rxcorr ] ) are referred to as the transmit and receive acfs , respectively .    when there are more than one scattering cluster , it is plausible to assume that the channel responses for different scattering clusters are uncorrelated .",
    "for example , for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 , we should expect @xmath91 .",
    "one shortage of the correlation functions ( [ eq : txcorr ] ) and ( [ eq : rxcorr ] ) is that the uncorrelatedness between scattering clusters is not accounted for in the multi - bounce case .",
    "however , when @xmath75 and @xmath76 are very small , which is generally the case , and the separation between the clusters is large enough , the acf ( [ eq : coloreddiff ] ) does not lose its generality and simplifies the analysis , which follows in the next section .",
    "through a spectral decomposition with properly chosen basis functions , random processes can be disassembled into uncorrelated random variables providing the canonical representation of the underlying process . in particular , for the scattering response whose acf is factorized into the transmit and the receive acfs as in ( [ eq : acffact ] ) , the spectral decomposition can be applied separately to each side giving the notion of transmit and receive subspaces .",
    "the number of effective subspaces with non - vanishing gains and the way that the transmit and receive subspaces are related give us the insight to the intrinsic number of degrees of freedom and the diversity gain of the channel .",
    "it has been discussed in the literature @xcite that bandlimited white random processes with a bounded time support can be decomposed using the prolate spheroidal wave functions ( pswfs ) as the basis . from the analogy between the time - frequency domains in waveform channels and the angle - array domains in linear arrays ,",
    "the pswfs can also be used for the spectral decomposition of the clustered and colored scattering response .",
    "thus , in this section , we first introduce some properties of the pswfs and then study the spectral decomposition of the colored scattering response @xmath92 . in this and the following sections , we are particularly interested in the multi - bounce diffuse scattering whose support is given by ( [ eq : multidiffsupport ] ) .",
    "the extension to the single - bounce case is discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .      before proceeding further , we first introduce some essential notions and theorems .",
    "we denote by @xmath93 the set of all complex valued functions @xmath94 defined on the real line @xmath18 and square integrable , i.e. @xmath95 analogously , the set of all complex valued functions @xmath94 defined on @xmath26 , which is a compact subset of @xmath18 , and square integrable on @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath96 .",

    "also , the set of all @xmath108-bandlimited functions is denoted by @xmath111 .",
