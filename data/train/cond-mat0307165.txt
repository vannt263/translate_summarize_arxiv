    "gaas can be doped with mn to form a dilute magnetic semiconductor with a curie temperature as high as 160 k. @xcite it is generally accepted that holes created by the substitution of mn for ga mediate the ferromagnetic interaction between mn dopants in this material.@xcite naively , each substitutional mn is expected to produce one hole ; therefore the nominal hole concentration , _ p _ , should be equal to the mn concentration . for typical mn fractions of 5% , this implies a hole concentration @xmath0 @xmath1 . measured hole concentrations of as - grown material are much less than this , typically by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "the source of this compensation remains somewhat controversial , having been variously attributed to either excess as in the form of antisites and interstitials@xcite or mn interstitials .",
    "@xcite recent experiments show that careful annealing near the growth temperature can significantly enhance the conductivity and hole concentration.@xcite this , as well as recent ion channelling experiments,@xcite suggests that interstitial mn is the more likely source .",
    "a complete picture is lacking , however ; for example , the distribution of mn interstitials in as - grown material is still unclear .",
    "cross - sectional scanning tunneling microscopy ( xstm ) is an effective tool for addressing this issue because it can image , with atomic resolution , the structural and electronic configuration of impurities and defects as they are present in the bulk .",
    "there are several recent xstm studies of mn - doped gaas;@xcite these studies used the correlation between transport data , level of mn doping , and observed defect density to infer the location ( substitutional versus interstitial ) of mn dopants and as antisites",
    ". the relative abundance of as antisites and interstitial mn deduced by these studies lacks a clear consensus : one study finds that antisites are not present at all,@xcite while another finds that both antisites and interstitial mn are present , and compensate substitutional mn.@xcite    to investigate the nature of dopants and defects in this material , we performed high resolution xstm measurements on a ( 110 ) cleavage plane of mn - doped gaas and used first - principles calculations to interpret the images . specifically , we used density - functional theory to simulate stm images for a number of mn configurations near the gaas ( 110 ) surface .",
    "configurations were chosen based on their calculated energetic stability , and included several metastable configurations that would probably be kinetically stabilized .",
    "a detailed comparison of the resulting simulated and experimental images leads us to the following conclusions : ( 1 ) isolated substitutional mn as well as pairs of substitutional mn occur with roughly comparable frequency in bulk mn - doped gaas , and ( 2 ) interstitial mn is typically bound in complexes with substitutional mn in several different configurations .",
    "the mn - doped gaas sample used in this study was grown by molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) using well established methods and conditions.@xcite a buffer layer of high quality undoped gaas was first grown on an _ n_-type gaas substrate .",
    "this was followed by growth of a 100 nm thick gaas buffer layer grown at 250@xmath3 c and a 260 nm thick layer of mn - doped gaas at the same temperature .",
    "growth quality was monitored by reflection high - energy electron diffraction .",
    "the mn concentration was determined with x - ray diffraction to be 0.6% .",
    "this sample was then characterized by xstm measurements in a multichamber ultrahigh - vacuum facility .",
    "it order to obtain an atomically abrupt cleave across the epilayer , the samples were thinned _ ex situ _ to @xmath4200 @xmath5 m . after being loaded into the xstm chamber ( base pressure @xmath410@xmath6 torr ) , the samples were scribed and cleaved _ in situ _ to expose a ( 110 ) surface ( perpendicular to the mbe growth direction ) , as previously described.@xcite the constant - current ( 40 pa ) images shown here are of filled electronic states measured with a sample bias of @xmath72.5 v.    figure  [ expt_stm ] shows the results of filled - state xstm measurements on this sample .",
    "the scan area of this image is 170 @xmath8 170 @xmath9 and displays @xmath21500 surface atoms .",
    "filled state stm images of gaas ( 110 ) reveal the as surface sublattice ; the surface ga sublattice evident in empty - state images , on the other hand , is not directly revealed in this image . since only the top as atoms contribute , stm of the gaas ( 110 ) surface reveals only every other layer in the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "figure  [ expt_stm ] reveals many surface features not normally seen in stm of the gaas ( 110 ) surface .",
    "several occur with enough regularity to warrant close attention .",
    "feature a is an elliptical region of intensity in an as ( 001 ) plane with major and minor axes the size of two and one as surface atoms , respectively .",
    "feature b is circular , and only slightly larger and more intense than the contributions from the surrounding as .",
    "feature c is more diffuse and broad than both a and b , with intensity spread over two pairs of as atoms in neighboring ( 001 ) planes . as discussed in more detail below , this is what one would expect if there were two a features in neighboring as ( 001 ) planes .",
    "feature d is of similar shape to that of c but is more asymmetric , with one side of the defect the size of a single surface as atom .",
    "there does not appear to be a preferred crystalline orientation of feature d as different orientations are visible in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] .",
    "feature e is a dark region close to a surface as atom displaced in the ( 00@xmath10 ) direction ; there is also an overall apparent depression in the vicinity of this feature , characteristic of band bending that occurs near positively charged defects on a _",
    "p_-type surface.@xcite    on the basis of the experimental data alone it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to determine what dopants or defects produce these features . as we show in this work",
    ", however , when interpreted with first - principles theory , these measurements resolve both the type and crystalline orientation of mn dopants in gaas .",
    "we modeled the gaas ( 110 ) surface in a supercell slab geometry consisting of 5 layers of gaas in a 4@xmath84 surface unit cell .",
    "a vacuum region of 13.4   was used for all the calculations . in such a cell",
    "the separation between a dopant and its periodic image is @xmath216  , sufficiently large to ensure that dopants interact only negligibly with their periodic images .",
    "the bottom layer of the slab was passivated ; the atomic positions were fully relaxed in all but the bottom two layers .",
    "the wavefunctions and charge density were expanded in a plane - wave basis and evaluated using an ultrasoft pseudopotential approach@xcite as implemented in the vasp code.@xcite electron correlations were treated at the level of the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) with total energies converged to 10@xmath11 ev .",
    "a single wave vector was used to sample the brilloun zone of the slab supercells and a plane - wave cutoff of 227.24 ev was used for all the calculations . for supercells containing mn , atoms within @xmath27.0   of the mn site(s ) were fully relaxed until the total energy between two structural configurations changed by less than 10@xmath12 ev .",
    "theoretical stm images were simulated using the method of tersoff and hamann.@xcite in this approach , the central quantity is the the local density of states ( ldos ) near the surface .",
    "the ldos is integrated over an energy range determined by the experimental bias voltage ; contours of constant energy - integrated ldos simulate a constant - current image . for filled state imaging ,",
    "the upper bound of this energy range is the fermi level .",
    "the mn - doped gaas sample under consideration in this work is _",
    "p_-type with an estimated hole density of 10@xmath13@xmath1 , so that the fermi level should be near the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "since we do not know the distribution of donors and acceptors present in the sample , this information alone is not sufficient to determine the exact location of the fermi level for our sample .",
    "however , we have found that , as a consequence of the large bias , the simulated images are rather insensitive to the value of the fermi level used in the ldos integration , and so we choose arbitrarily a point 0.4 ev above the vbm as the upper bound for all the stm simulations . for this choice , the fermi level is above the acceptor level of substitutional mn and below the donor levels of interstitial mn .",
    "simulations performed with the position of the fermi level shifted by @xmath140.3 ev give similar results .",
    "the location of the vbm for each type of dopant was determined by inspection of the total dos relative to that projected onto the dopant site .    as a measure of the agreement between simulated and measured stm images ,",
    "we consider mainly the overall shape and spatial extent of features of interest .",
    "the defect - free ( 110 ) surface has a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror plane symmetry , so it is also useful to note whether a particular dopant configuration preserves , even approximately , this symmetry .",
    "finally , we use qualitative arguments to judge whether the number of observed features are consistent with our total - energy calculations .",
    "substitutional mn dopants are of primary importance for the magnetic and transport properties of mn - doped gaas , and hence we discuss the simulated stm images for these types of dopants first . since stm is a near - surface sensitive probe , we have only considered substitutional mn dopants in the top three layers near the ( 110 ) surface , as shown in fig .  [ struk_new](a )",
    ".    we will use the notation @xmath15 to denote a substitutional mn in layer @xmath16 ( with the topmost surface layer defined as @xmath17 ) .",
    "figures  [ mnga_stms_combined](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show the simulated images from @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively . the @xmath18 and @xmath20 images are strikingly similar , for the following reasons . the @xmath18 mn atom forms bonds with two as atoms that are nominally in the same plane ; likewise for the @xmath20 mn atom .",
    "thus the overall shape of the dopant consists of three overlapping maxima , centered on the two as atoms and on the mn atom , giving rise to an elongated feature with a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror - plane symmetry .",
    "hence , both of these sites are consistent with feature a in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] .",
    "the @xmath19 dopant on the other hand , has a very different image . in the @xmath19 location",
    "the mn forms a bond with an as atom in the top layer , with the bond pointing toward the surface .",
    "the perturbation due to @xmath19 is centered on the surface as site involved in the bond .",
    "this overlaps with the contribution from the mn dopant itself , and thus the shape is more circular compared to the @xmath18 and @xmath20 dopants .",
    "it is also larger in size than surface as atom contributions and has a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror - plane symmetry .",
    "these agree qualitatively with the characteristics of feature b in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] , leading us to identify those features as arising from @xmath19 dopants .",
    "since there will always be some fraction of neighboring mn that occur simply by chance , we consider pairs of substitutional mn as well . figures  [ mnga_stms_combined](d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) show simulated images of pairs of mn substitutionals @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . for the @xmath23 pair , we note that even though the two mn involved are @xmath26.8   apart , and in different atomic planes , because of the projected view of the stm scan the appearance of this pair is quite similar to those of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 pairs .",
    "all three of these simulated images have a shape comparable to that of feature c in fig .  [ expt_stm ] .",
    "common features include a region of low intensity between the two dopants , a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror - plane symmetry ( the experimental data appear to only approximately have this symmetry ) and a similar spatial extent involving four surface as atoms .",
    "it is also interesting to note that these pairs have simulated images that are essentially a linear superposition of the images of the isolated substitutionals shown in figs .",
    "[ mnga_stms_combined](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "this suggests that , at the level of detail that stm reveals , two substitutional mn do not interact very strongly when they are next - nearest neighbors .",
    "figures  [ mnga_stms_combined](g ) and ( h ) show the simulated images for nearest - neighbor substitutional pairs @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "overall , the simulated images of these pairs are similar to what one would obtain from a linear superposition of the images of the isolated defects .",
    "however , the simulated image for @xmath24 clearly reveals that the contribution from the @xmath18 dopant is now asymmetric , lacking a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror plane .",
    "this indicates that substitutional pairs interact more strongly when they are in near - neighbor configuration than in the next - nearest - neighbor configuration described in the paragraph above .",
    "the shape of these simulated images is generally consistent with that of feature d in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] , with a characteristic `` l '' shape involving three as atoms , two of which are in the same as ( 001 ) plane .",
    "we have not found any other dopants that yield such a favorable comparison to the experimental data , leading us to identify feature d as @xmath24 and @xmath25 pairs . in the experimental data",
    "one can observe three of the four possible crystal orientations of these pairs of substitutionals .",
    "an estimate of the number of neighboring pairs of mn substitutionals based on a random distribution of mn on the ga sublattice is much lower than the number of compound features , in particular those labeled `` c '' , seen in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] . even if there is some positional correlation among the substitutional dopants , for example , the strong short - range attraction between mn found in a recent theoretical study,@xcite it is unlikely that a description based entirely on substitutionals and clusters of substitutionals can describe the frequency and shapes of all the features in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] .",
    "this suggests that other mn complexes , in particular those involving interstitial mn , may help explain the remaining features .",
    "it has recently been shown that although the formation energy of interstitial mn is much higher than that of substitutional mn in bulk gaas , the presence of the ( 001 ) growth surface significantly enhances the likelihood of mn occupying interstitial sites.@xcite thus one expects that both substitutional and interstitial mn will be present in typical mn - doped gaas samples , as shown by recent measurements of the mn distribution in mn - doped gaas.@xcite    in the bulk , the barrier for diffusion of a charged ( @xmath262_e _ ) interstitial mn is @xmath20.5 ev ; therefore at room temperature we expect interstitial mn to rapidly diffuse throughout the bulk material unless it becomes kinetically trapped . since substitutional dopants are acceptors , they are a natural trap for interstitials , electrostatically binding to them in a number of different physical configurations . clustering phenomena for compensating dopants such as these",
    "have recently been predicted using monte carlo techniques.@xcite on the other hand , since interstitial mn in bulk is a double donor with charge of @xmath262_e _ , under conditions of filled - state imaging ( for which the tip is positively biased relative to the sample ) free interstitial mn will be repelled away from the surface , leaving behind only those interstitials that are bound in complexes . to determine which such interstitial - substitutional complexes are most likely to be present",
    ", we turn to total - energy calculations .    to simplify the discussion , we extend the notation introduced earlier to now include mn interstitials , and complexes of interstitial and substitutional mn .",
    "isolated interstitial mn in layer @xmath16 , coordinated to as and ga , will be referred to as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . for reference ,",
    "the configuration of isolated interstitial dopants in the first two layers is shown in fig .",
    "[ struk_new](b ) .",
    "complexes composed of interstitial and substitutional mn will be referred to with a composite notation that takes into account the crystalline orientation of the atoms involved .",
    "for example , since the gaas ( 110 ) surface does not have a ( 001 ) mirror - plane symmetry , there are two distinct ways of forming a complex of interstitial and substitutional mn . in fig .",
    "[ struk_new ] the surface ga atoms are to the right of the surface as atoms to which they are bonded , so that we may consider complexes where the interstitial mn is to the left or right of the neighboring substitutional dopant ; such complexes will be denoted as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ struk_new](c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) shows the configuration of near - surface complexes we have considered in this work .",
    "thus , for example , fig .",
    "[ struk_new](c ) shows the complexes @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which we discuss below .",
    "figure  [ defect_energies ] shows the calculated total energies of mn complexes relative to that of the @xmath32 dopant , which we identify as the lowest energy configuration . there is a large variation in the energies , up to @xmath21.3 ev above the energy of @xmath32 .",
    "we also note that for complexes involving only mn atoms on the surface ( figs .",
    "[ defect_energies](a ) and ( c ) ) the lowest energy configuration occurs when the interstitial site is nearest the substitutional site .",
    "relative to these nearest - neighbor complexes , when interstitial mn is displaced by lateral translations in the ( @xmath1010 ) direction , the energy increases dramatically ; the next lowest energy configurations are @xmath20.3 ev higher in energy .",
    "thus , diffusion of surface interstitial mn from high - energy locations ( denoted with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) to low - energy configurations is likely to form nearest - neighbor complexes on the surface .",
    "it is difficult to estimate , on energetic grounds alone , the expected number of such complexes .",
    "the presence of both the surface and the stm tip create additional complications .",
    "for example , the energy of interstitial mn depends strongly on its proximity to the gaas ( 110 ) surface ; an interstitial mn in the interior of gaas far from the surface can lower its energy as much as @xmath21 ev by moving to a location just below the surface.@xcite this suggests that interstitial mn will diffuse from the bulk - like region toward the surface ; during the stm scans these `` excess '' interstitials will be observed only if they are bound in complexes .",
    "such phenomena are difficult to quantify and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead we choose simply to report simulated stm images of several low - energy complexes within the shaded regions of fig .",
    "[ defect_energies ] .        figure  [ mnga_si_combined ] shows the simulated images for the low - energy configurations of substitutional - interstitial complexes . the simulated image of the lowest energy substitutional - interstitial surface complex , @xmath35 , is shown in fig .  [ mnga_si_combined](a ) .",
    "there is a reduction in intensity of the as surface atom to the right of the @xmath18 site and in the region between the as ( 001 ) planes to the left of the @xmath18 site .",

    "all four of these simulated images are generally consistent with the characteristics of feature e in the experimental data of fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] . however , since the @xmath32 complex is much lower in energy ( @xmath20.5 ev ) than the other complexes just described , and since there appears to be only two such features in fig .",
    "[ expt_stm ] , we suggest that feature e is most likely a @xmath32 complex .",
    "if this is correct , then the observed apparent displacement of the surface as atom results mainly from an electronic effect rather than a real atomic displacement .",
    "the simulated image of the @xmath38 complex shown in fig .  [ mnga_si_combined](b ) is rather different than those for the complexes just described .",
    "this simulated image obviously has a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror - plane symmetry and a `` butterfly '' shape with a region of lower intensity between the mn atoms .",
    "since there is no ( 001 ) mirror plane , the left and right wings of the butterfly are clearly different , with the contribution from the @xmath18 mn more intense than that of the @xmath39(1 ) .",
    "overall , these characteristics are similar to those of feature c , which appears to involve four as surface atoms in neighboring ( 001 ) planes .",
    "as we discuss below , there are other energetically competitive complexes with similar simulated images , so that we postpone any conclusions regarding feature c until all the relevant complexes have been discussed .    the simulated image of the @xmath31 complex shown in fig .  [ mnga_si_combined](e ) does not have a ( @xmath1010 ) mirror plane symmetry . in this configuration",
    "there is an oblate region of intensity along the as ( 001 ) plane and a reduction in the surface as atom intensity nearest the interstitial site .",
    "on the basis of the available stm data , we can not rule out the possibility that some of those features labeled b in fig .",
