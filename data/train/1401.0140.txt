    "we look at even higher - order polarizabilities and compare theoretical predictions to results obtained from dispersive approaches to compton scattering . in sec .  5 , we discuss how virtual compton scattering has been used in order to determine polarizability distributions within the proton .",
    "finally , in a concluding section 6 , we present a brief summary of what has been learned as well as a glimpse into possible future work in this area .",
    "in classical physics when elementary systems having structure are probed via application of an external electric field , various responses are conceivable . in the simplest case , the applied field leads to a charge separation and thereby to an induced electric dipole moment , with positive ( negative ) charges moving in the direction ( opposite to the direction ) of the field @xcite . in the case of orientation polarization , preexisting but",
    "initially randomly oriented permanent dipole moments are lined up by the applied field . in anisotropic materials , even though the polarization still depends linearly on the field , its direction is not necessarily parallel to the applied field but is determined in terms of a polarizability tensor of second rank @xcite . finally , in ferroelectric materials the polarization is a nonlinear function of the electric field showing , in addition , a hysteresis effect .    in the first of the above cases ,",
    "the electric polarizability @xmath1 of a system is simply the constant of proportionality between the applied static and uniform field @xmath2 and the induced electric dipole moment @xmath3 , @xmath4 corresponding to a potential energy @xmath5 the factor of @xmath6 is related with the ( standard ) use of gaussian units for the polarizabilities but natural units in field - theoretical calculations .",
    "clearly the electric polarizability is expected to be a positive quantity and its magnitude provides a measure of the `` stiffness '' or resistance to deformation of the system .    similarly , when a static and uniform magnetizing field @xmath7 is applied to such an elementary system there are two competing mechanisms at work . on the one hand , if the fundamental constituents of the system themselves possess intrinsic magnetic dipole moments , they tend to align in the direction of the applied field , producing a positive ( paramagnetic ) effect . on the other hand , by lenz law",
    "an applied field induces currents which produce an induced magnetic moment opposite to this field , yielding a negative ( diamagnetic ) effect . using the definition @xmath8",
    "corresponding to a potential energy @xmath9 the magnetic polarizability can be either positive of negative depending on which mechanism is dominant .",
    "an equivalent means of expressing these results is in terms of the energy density of a dilute macroscopic collection of such polarizable particles randomly distributed within a volume @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the number density of these particles then the energy density of the ( dilute ) system including polarizability effects is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote given external electric and magnetic fields applied to the medium .",
    "for the moment we assume a constant and uniform number density @xmath15 .",
    "comparing with the definition of the dielectric constant @xmath16 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the net fields in the presence of the induced dipoles , we see that at the classical level we identify at leading order in the number density @xmath20 thus eq .",

    "the magnetic polarizability of the hydrogen atom is much smaller than its electric counterpart .",

    "next we move to consider the polarizabilities of strongly interacting particles , namely , hadrons .",
    "we begin with a simple charged spinless particle such as , e.g. , a @xmath62 . because the particle is charged , the use of macroscopic samples and a constant external electric field is not feasible .",

    "however , in the near future this situation will change substantially due to compton scattering experiments involving polarized photons and polarized targets .",
    "this effort should take place at mami , where such work has already begun and at higs , where improved mirrors should enable a viable future program . at mami ,",
    "a series of measurements is envisioned in the photon energy range of about 80 - 300 mev and is of three types :    * linearly polarized photons either parallel or perpendicular to the scattering plane with an unpolarized target ( usually called the beam asymmetry ) : @xmath82 * circularly polarized photons and target spin aligned longitudinally with the beam direction : @xmath83 * circularly polarized photons and target spin aligned transverse to the beam direction : @xmath84    here the measurements of @xmath85 and @xmath86 have already been accomplished , while the remaining measurement of @xmath87 is scheduled to take place in 2014 @xcite .",

    "it is obvious that the concept of polarizabilities can be generalized to even higher orders @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a definition of so - called dynamical polarizabilities ) .",
    "for example , in the spin - independent sector the @xmath89 generalization of the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xcite @xmath90 the meaning of these new quadratic terms is clear .",
    "the quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 represent dispersive corrections to the leading electric and magnetic polarizabilities and measure the frequency dependence of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities via @xmath93 likewise , it is clear that the quadrupole polarizabilities @xmath94 and @xmath95 measure the size of the induced quadrupole moments in the presence of an applied field gradient via @xmath96 where @xmath97\\big|\\psi\\big\\rangle\\ ] ] is the induced electric quadrupole moment and @xmath98 is its magnetic analog .    these four new polarizabilities can be calculated in various pictures of the nucleon .",

    "in the region 50 mev@xmath119 100 mev the dipole polarizabilities come into play and it is this region which has been used in the experimental determination of these quantities . even at these relatively low energies , however , there are important contributions from the higher - order terms and these must be estimated ( usually dispersively ) in order to perform the experimental extraction of @xmath120 .",
    "this problem is exacerbated at higher energies so that it is not realistic to think that one can extract quadrupole polarizabilities or higher in this fashion .",
    "it _ is _ , however , possible to make an experimental determination by _",
    "indirect _ means .",
    "that is , one can use subtracted fixed-@xmath121 dispersion relations to provide a complete low - energy analysis of the compton amplitude and then to extract the relevant polarizabilities from this calculated amplitude . in this approach , one writes each invariant amplitude @xmath122 in the form @xcite @xmath123 = a_i^{\\rm born}(\\nu , t)+[a_i(0,t)-a_i^{\\rm born}(0,t ) ] + \\frac{2\\nu^2}{\\pi}p \\int_{\\nu_0}^\\infty d\\nu'\\frac{{\\rm im}_s[a_i(\\nu',t)]}{\\nu'({\\nu'}^2-\\nu^2 ) } , \\label{eq : gh}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the average of the incoming and outgoing photon energy@xmath125and @xmath126 $ ] denotes the discontinuities across the @xmath127-channel cuts of the compton process .",
