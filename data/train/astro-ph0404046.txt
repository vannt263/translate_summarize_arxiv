    "3c  111 ( @xmath0 ) is an x - ray bright broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) which is classified as a fanaroff - riley type ii source with a double - lobe / single jet morphology ( linfield & perley 1984 , see figure 1 ) and reported superluminal motion ( preuss et al .",
    "it is a well - known x - ray source , and was observed by every major x - ray observatory since _",
    "heao-1_.    during the last decade",
    "numerous attempts were made to compare the x - ray properties of radio quiet seyfert  1 galaxies and bright broad - line radio galaxies ( blrg ) ( e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 , woniak et al .",
    "1998 , eracleous et al .",
    "it was shown that the typical spectral shape of radio quiet seyfert  1 is well described in the 2500 kev energy range by an intrinsic power law with @xmath1 with an exponential cutoff energy of the order of several hundred kev and a compton reflection component due to reflection of the power - law photons from cold matter covering a solid angle of @xmath2 ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 , zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ) . as for the blrg",
    ", their average spectrum , with a photon index @xmath3 power law , seems to have no , or little indication of the reflected component .",
    "if associated with the jet their x - ray emission is likely to be related to non - thermal compton scattering . with the present data a thermal origin of the emission still can not be ruled out .    main attention in all the x - ray observations of 3c",
    "111 has been focused on characterizing its spectral shape . in the 2  20 kev energy range",
    "all measured spectra are consistent with a power - law spectrum modified by the effects of neutral absorption ( e.g. weaver et al .",
    "1995 , nandra & pounds 1994 , reynolds et al .",
    "1998 ) .    for the hard x - ray spectrum we have less reliable results .",
    "observations by _ hexte _ , _ osse _ and _ bepposax _ are not sufficient enough to confirm or to rule out the break in the hard x - ray tail of the source spectrum ( woniak et al .",
    "1998 , eracleous et al .",
    "2000 , grandi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "no significant short time variability was reported ( see eracleous et al . 2000 for a discussion on _ rxte _ 1997 data ) . as for the long term variability ,",
    "the 2 - 10 kev flux of 3c  111 varied by a factor of @xmath45 during its whole observation history ( e.g. reynolds et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the _ integral _ and _ rxte _ observations of 3c  111 , and compare them with the results of previous missions .",
    "we retrieved the _",
    "data from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc).the _ integral _ and part of the _ rxte _ data presented here are unpublished so far .",
    "the first time 3c  111 was in the _ integral _ field of view occurred during the galactic plane scan observations in march / april 2003 .",
    "unfortunately the source was too weak to be significantly detected in 6.2 ksec during which the source had offset of less than 10 degrees .    the second time _ integral _ observed 3c  111 during revolution 102 starting august 14 2003 for 57 ksec , during the calibration observations of the crab .",
    "the observations were performed in staring mode , during which 3c  111 was 9off - axis . staring mode is the worst one for spi , as in this case spi data can not be used to reconstruct images and spectra of sources which are not on - axis ( vedrenne et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "because of the offset of the source in both series of the observations , 3c  111 was neither in _ integral _ x - ray monitor jem - x , nor in the _ integral _ optical monitor omc field of view .",
    "the _ integral _ on - board imager ibis ( ubertini et al .",
    "2003 ) consists of two detectors , isgri and picsit , working in the energy band 15 kev  10 mev , and allows to localize sources with an accuracy down to 30 arcseconds . the current version of the picsit data analysis is not working with more than eight degrees off - axis sources . thus in our analysis",
    "we were able to use only the data obtained by the ibis / isgri detector ( lebrun et al .",
    "version 3.0 of the isdc s ( courvoisier et al . 2003 ) offline standard analysis software ( osa ) was used .    in figure 2 the august ibis / isgri significance map of the crab region in 20 - 30",
    "kev energy range is shown .",
    "it is a mosaic image of all the observations with 3c  111 in the field of view , which results in a total exposure of 57 ksec .",
    "the crab is the brightest source of the region . besides it , 4u",
    "0352 + 30 ( x - persei ) is clearly detected at a significance level of 22.6 @xmath5 .",
    "3c111 is detected at a significance level of 5.2 @xmath5 , the resulted form of the source is not round , and the source position is only adjacent to the brightest and most significant pixel ( figure 3 ) .    such a behavior can be explained if we look at the right panel of figure 2 , in which the image obtained without ghost subtraction is shown .",
    "unfortunately 3c  111 is located in the area affected by the crab .",
    "thus the only information that we can extract from isgri data is the upper limit of the 3c111 flux , which is 9 mcrab in 20 - 30 kev , 3 mcrab in 30 - 40 kev and 6 mcrab in 40 - 60 kev energy ranges .",
    "_ rxte _ public data are present in the heasarc archive for 1997 , 1999 , 2001 and 2003 . for the _ rxte_/pca data reduction we used standard programs of the ftools",
    "/ lheasoft 5.2 package . for estimation of the background we applied the `` l7_240''-based model .",
    "the results of the 1997 observations were already published in the paper of eracleous et .",
    "al 2000 .    in figure 4 the lightcurve of the _",
    "rxte_/pca observations of 3c 111 is presented .",
    "no significant fluctuations on time scales less than an hour were observed . in 1999",
    "the source was monitored for more than a month . during this period",
    "the source flux increased from 1.0 to 1.8 mcrabs .",
    "there are also significant variations on the time scale of years . during the _ rxte_/pca period of observations the intensity of the source varied from 1 mcrab in 1999 to 4.5 mcrab in 2001 . in 1997 and 2003",
    "the source was at an intermediate level of 2.5 and 2.7 mcrab , respectively .",
    "the observed _ rxte_/pca flux in the 20 - 30 kev energy range is consistent with the upper limit observed by _ integral_/isgri .    in figure 5 the pca spectra of the brightest and faintest states of 3c111 during the _ rxte _",
    "observations are shown along with the average hexte spectrum and sax / pds spectrum . in the 2  20 kev energy range 3c",
    "111 has typical for blrgs spectrum , consistent with a power - law spectrum modified by the effects of neutral absorption and fe k@xmath6 line emission .",
    "available high energy data do not provide information whether the spectrum has a cutoff at higher energies . in table 1",
    "the best - fit parameters for the spectra averaged over the given time period are listed . only in 2001 emission line at 6.4 kev",
    "significantly improves the @xmath7 statistics . in 2003 ,",
    "due to problems with the response matrix , the spectrum is meaningful only above 6 kev .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in figure 6 the history of the 3c  111 flux in 2 - 10 kev energy range , and its power - law index variation is summarized .",
    "_ rxte _ was lucky to observe the source during one of its faintest states ( january 1999 ) and its brightest state ( march , 2001 ) .",
    "however , no significant spectral changes are observed , except the fact that the brightest state is the only one where the introduction of the fe emission line significantly improves the @xmath7 statistics . but this effect can be easily explained by the higher data quality .",
    "authors are grateful to m. revnivtsev for the help in rxte data reduction .",
