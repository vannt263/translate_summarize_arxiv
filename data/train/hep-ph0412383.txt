    "the flux of atmospheric tau neutrinos in the gev to tev energy range comes from both the intrinsic atmospheric @xmath0 flux and the flux due to the neutrino flavor oscillation @xmath3 .",
    "the importance of understanding such a flux is twofold .",
    "first , the detection of atmospheric @xmath0 flux is important for confirming the atmospheric @xmath4 oscillation scenario which is so far established only by the @xmath5 disappearance measurement @xcite .",
    "second , the atmospheric @xmath0 flux is also an important background for the search of astrophysical @xmath0 fluxes @xcite or exotic @xmath0 fluxes such as those arising from dark matter annihilations @xcite , if an effective tau neutrino astronomy can be developed in the future .",
    "the techniques for identifying the tau neutrinos in the gev to tev energy range are discussed both in the experiments for atmospheric tau neutrinos @xcite and in the accelerator - based neutrino experiments @xcite . due to growing attentions on the direct @xmath0 detections ,",
    "it is important to investigate closely the flux of atmospheric tau neutrinos in such an energy range .",
    "the calculation of atmospheric @xmath5 and @xmath6 fluxes has reached to a rather advanced stage @xcite .",
    "the upward atmospheric @xmath0 flux can be calculated easily from the above @xmath5 flux by multiplying the @xmath4 oscillation probability arising from neutrino propagation inside the earth .",
    "in such a case , the @xmath4 oscillations in the atmosphere is generally negligible .",
    "however , the atmospheric neutrino coming with a zenith angle @xmath7 less than @xmath8 directly arrives at the detector",
    ". hence oscillations of these neutrinos in the atmosphere are precisely the problems one has to deal with . in this regard , an estimation of the atmospheric @xmath0 flux is given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the two - flavor neutrino oscillation framework @xcite .",
    "a detailed calculation of this flux in the same neutrino oscillation framework is given in @xcite for zenith angles @xmath9 , where the earth curvature can be neglected in the calculation .",
    "the extension of such a calculation to large zenith angles is important .",
    "first of all , the path - length for the neutrino propagation in the atmosphere increases drastically from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . as a result ,",
    "the atmospheric @xmath0 flux also increases drastically in this zenith angle range by the enhanced @xmath4 oscillation probabilities .",
    "secondly , the calculation of upward atmospheric @xmath0 flux is also important since most of the neutrino telescopes aim at detecting upward neutrino fluxes . in this paper",
    ", we shall extend the calculation in @xcite to the entire zenith angle range .",
    "the calculations of atmospheric @xmath0 flux for zenith angles @xmath12 and zenith angles slightly larger than @xmath8 are much more involved as we shall discuss later . besides extending our previous calculation to the entire zenith angles",
    ", we also extend its validity from the energy range @xmath13 gev to the energy range @xmath14 gev .",
    "this improvement is accomplished by including the muon - decay contribution @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the intrinsic atmospheric @xmath5 flux , in additional to those arising from two - body @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays .",
    "such a contribution also generates @xmath0 flux by @xmath4 oscillations .",
    "this part of @xmath0 flux is non - negligible for @xmath19 gev .",
    "furthermore , it contributes to the total @xmath0 flux in a growing percentage as the zenith angle @xmath7 increases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the method for calculating the intrinsic muon and tau neutrino fluxes .",
    "particularly we outline the strategy for dealing with atmospheric neutrino flux for @xmath20 . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the atmospheric tau neutrino flux taking into account the neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "we discuss implications of our results in sec .",
    "we follow the approach in @xcite for computing the flux of intrinsic atmospheric muon neutrinos which could oscillate into tau neutrinos .",
    "this approach computes the flux of muon neutrinos coming from pion and kaon decays .",

    "@xcite , the atmospheric @xmath0 flux taking into account the oscillation effect also contains uncertainties beginning at a few hundred gev s . in the same figure",
    ", we also plot the corresponding atmospheric @xmath5 flux .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath0 fluxes are comparable for @xmath245 gev . in such a case , the footprint of @xmath0 might be identified by studying the energy spectra of shower events induced by neutrino interactions @xcite . at @xmath155 gev ,",

    "here we have done the calculation with the best fit value of @xmath251 and @xmath162 taken from @xcite .",
    "furthermore we include the contribution of intrinsic atmospheric @xmath0 flux and its associated uncertainties .",
    "the understanding of atmospheric @xmath0 flux is important for exploring the tau neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , an estimation of the atmospheric @xmath0 flux has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite while a detailed calculation of this flux for zenith angles @xmath252 is given in ref .  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "comparisons of the galactic - plane @xmath0 flux with the atmospheric @xmath0 flux are also made for illustrating the possibility of the tau neutrino astronomy .",
    "now that we have obtained a complete result of the atmospheric @xmath0 flux for the entire zenith angle range , we compare this flux with two astrophysical fluxes : the galactic - plane tau neutrino flux just mentioned and the cosmological @xmath0 flux due to neutralino dark matter annihilations @xcite .",
    "the comparison is depicted in fig .",
    "[ various_tau ] where the flux of galactic - plane tau neutrinos is taken from the calculation of ref .",
    "one can see that the galactic - plane @xmath0 flux dominates over the downward ( @xmath171 ) atmospheric @xmath0 flux for @xmath22 greater than a few gev .",
    "hence , in this direction , it is possible to observe the flux of galactic - plane tau neutrinos in the gev energy range . for near horizontal directions , the atmospheric @xmath0 flux grows rapidly with zenith angles .",
    "therefore , for @xmath11 , the energy threshold for galactic - plane tau neutrino flux to dominate over its atmospheric counterpart is pushed up to @xmath253 gev .",
    "we further see that the galactic - plane @xmath0 flux does not dominate the upward atmospheric @xmath0 background ( @xmath254 ) until @xmath247 gev . however , it is noteworthy that , in the muon neutrino case , galactic - plane neutrino flux is overwhelmed by the atmospheric background until @xmath255 gev @xcite .",
    "such a difference between @xmath5 and @xmath0 shows the promise of the tau neutrino astronomy in the gev energy range as pointed out in @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ various_tau ] , it is also clear that the atmospheric @xmath0 flux is a non - negligible background to the cosmological tau neutrino flux due to neutralino dark matter annihilations @xcite .",
    "in fact , two fluxes are comparable in the downward direction while the atmospheric @xmath0 flux dominates in horizontal and upward directions .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented a semi - analytical calculation on the atmospheric @xmath0 flux in the gev to tev energy range for downward , upward , and horizontal directions .",
    "the atmospheric @xmath0 flux at @xmath11 is two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding flux at @xmath171 for @xmath256 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fluxes with zenith angles between @xmath257 and @xmath258 degrees merge for @xmath259 gev , provided that the intrinsic atmospheric @xmath0 flux is calculated with perturbative qcd .",
    "should one adopt a non - perturbative model for the intrinsic @xmath0 flux , the resulting @xmath0 fluxes on earth at different zenith angles would merge at an energy lower than @xmath260 gev .",
    "we have observed that the upward atmospheric @xmath0 fluxes show oscillatory behaviors . for the averaged flux with @xmath254 ,",
    "the atmospheric @xmath0 flux is found to be comparable to the atmospheric @xmath5 flux for @xmath245 gev .",
    "the comparison of this flux with the horizontal atmospheric @xmath0 flux is also interesting .",
    "two fluxes are in fact comparable for @xmath261 gev .",
    "this shows that the @xmath4 oscillation is already quite significant in the horizontal direction for such an energy range .",
    "nevertheless , the upward atmospheric @xmath0 flux takes over from @xmath196 gev until @xmath262 tev where two fluxes merge again . concerning the uncertainties in our calculations ,",
    "we have studied the dependencies of atmospheric @xmath0 flux on the @xmath65 moment @xmath62 for representative zenith angles @xmath171 and @xmath11 .",
    "we have also discussed in detail the uncertainty of intrinsic atmospheric @xmath0 flux due to different models for charm hadron productions .",
    "the consequence of such a uncertainty on the determination of oscillated @xmath0 flux is studied as well .",
    "concerning the technique for calculating the atmospheric @xmath0 flux from large zenith angles , we have verified the validity of using @xmath190 in eq .",
