    "high transverse momentum particles in central au+au collisions are found to be significantly suppressed compared to that from p+p collisions.@xcite this is consistent with the picture that high energy partons are quenched when propagating through the dense medium created in central nucleus - nucleus collisions;@xcite and this suppression is thus a probe for the quark gluon plasma .",
    "light hadron suppression at rhic has been described by a gluon radiation energy loss mechanism.@xcite recent rhic data@xcite show that the suppression of non - photonic electrons ( electrons from heavy quark decays ) has almost the same magnitude as that of light hadrons in central au+au collisions .",
    "this implies that heavy quarks may lose a substantial amount of energy , which can not be explained by current theoretical predictions based on gluon radiation as the dominant mechanism for energy loss.@xcite heavy quark would lose much less energy because the gluon radiation is suppressed at small angles due to the mass of heavy quarks ( dead cone effect@xcite ) .",
    "recent calculations including both gluon radiation and collisional energy loss increase the heavy quark energy loss.@xcite in both scenarios electrons from charm decays are always more suppressed than those from bottom .",
    "however , theoretical calculations contain large uncertainties with respect to the relative contributions to non - photonic electrons from charm and bottom quarks .",
    "another important tool to study the quark gluon plasma properties is the angular anisotropy @xmath4 .",

    "the width of near - side peak for electrons from @xmath1 decays is much narrower than those for the @xmath2 decays .",
    "the wide width from @xmath2 meson decays is due to the larger energy release ( @xmath22 value ) in the @xmath2 meson semi - leptonic decays leading to a broad angular correlation between daughter hadrons and electrons in the laboratory frame . for an electron at high",

    "electrons will deposit almost all of their energy in the bemc while this is not true for hadrons .",
    "further hadron rejection is provided by the shower maximum detector ( smd ) , which allows us to cut on the shower size with high spatial resolution .",
