    "many imaging techniques reconstruct a signal from its frequency or fourier measurements .",
    "but in practice the phase information of the data in the frequency domain may not be available to the detecting and sensing devices , e.g. , in x - ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "it therefore arises the problem of recovering a signal from its fourier magnitude only measurements , known as phase retrieval .",
    "other applications of phase retrieval include optics @xcite , diffraction imaging @xcite , astronomical imaging @xcite and magnetic resonance imaging @xcite , to name just a few .",
    "since more than one signal can result in the same fourier magnitude measurements , the phase retrieval problem is ill - posed .",
    "for example , a solution to the problem can be subject to so - called global phase ambiguity including a constant global phase , spatial shift and conjugate inversion .",
    "though such ambiguities are acceptable in practical applications , there may exist infinitely many solutions beyond these trivial associates . to resolve the problem , it is shown in @xcite that twofold oversampling in each dimension in the frequency domain",
    "almost always specifies a unique solution ( up to global phase ) for finitely supported , real - valued and nonnegative signals while it does not work for 1d signals . due to the nonlinear relationship between the magnitude measurements and the signal of interest , the algorithm design remains a major problem in phase retrieval .",
    "current approach to signal reconstruction with the oversampling technique include the popular iterative projection algorithms @xcite and recent convex optimization method @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to reduce the required number of measurements in phase retrieval since every single one of the measurements may have a potential time and/or power cost .",
    "moreover , oversampling can be inconvenient or impossible in applications , e.g. , bragg sampling from periodic crystalline structures @xcite . compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite is an emerging technique which aims at reconstructing a high dimensional signal from its low dimensional linear measurements under a sparsity prior .",
    "a prosperous direction is to combine cs with phase retrieval , known as compressive phase retrieval ( cpr ) @xcite , which reduces the required number of measurements by exploiting the signal sparsity .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a sparse 2d image can be uniquely determined ( up to global phase ) with significantly reduced , undersampled fourier magnitude measurements .",
    "modified iterative projection algorithms are proposed in @xcite for cpr in the noise free case .",
    "convex optimization method is developed in @xcite inspired by @xcite with slow computing speed .",
    "the state of the art is generalized approximate message passing ( gamp ) based algorithm which is introduced in @xcite and shown to have good performance in both recovery accuracy and computing speed .    in this paper ,",
    "nonconvex @xmath0 minimization problems are formulated for noiseless and noisy cpr problems inspired by existing cs results .",
    "a desirable property is shown in the widely studied scenario of real - valued , nonnegative image reconstruction that the image of interest is an optimal solution of the formulated @xmath0 minimization problem in the noise free case .",
    "first - order iterative algorithms are proposed to solve the formulated problems based on the alternating direction method ( adm ) @xcite in convex optimization .",
    "numerical simulations are provided for simulated sparse images and nonnegative image to demonstrate the fast , accurate and robust performance of the proposed approach .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] presents our problem formulations for the noiseless and noisy cpr problems .",
    "section [ sec : algorithm ] presents the adm - based algorithms for the proposed @xmath0 minimization problems .",
    "section [ sec : simulation ] provides the simulation results and section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we study the recovery of sparse signals from their fourier magnitude measurements , known as compressive phase retrieval . inspired by the recent cs technique , we propose to solve the following lasso - like optimization problem where @xmath1 is the signal of interest , @xmath2 denotes the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) constrained on the index set @xmath3 , @xmath4 denotes the observed ( generally noisy ) fourier magnitude measurements on @xmath3 and @xmath5 is a regularization parameter .",
    "the second term in ( [ formu : lasso ] ) fits the observed magnitude data while the @xmath0 norm is used to promote the signal sparsity",
    ". an equivalent formulation of ( [ formu : lasso ] ) is where @xmath6 controls the fidelity of the reconstruction to the measured data .",
    "it is known that ( [ formu : lasso ] ) and ( [ formu : bpdn ] ) are equivalent with appropriate choices of @xmath7 and @xmath6 . as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , both ( [ formu : lasso ] ) and ( [ formu : bpdn ] ) reduces to in the noise free case .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 minimization problem ( [ formu : bp ] ) has been studied in @xcite .",
    "however , there have been few theoretical results on its performance analysis . the following theorem deals with a practical and widely studied scenario where the signal of interest is nonnegative ( nonnegative means real - valued as well in this paper ) .",
    "although far from satisfactory , this result nevertheless provides some assurance on the reliability of the proposed @xmath0 minimization approach .",
    "if @xmath10 and its fourier magnitudes @xmath11 is observed , where @xmath3 contains the zero frequency , then @xmath12 is an optimal solution to ( [ formu : bp ] ) .",
    "[ thm : optimality ]    _ proof : _ we need to show that the inequality @xmath13 holds for any @xmath1 satisfying @xmath14 . to do this , consider the dc ( zero frequency ) term of the frequency data which is proportional to the sum of all elements of the signal vector .",
    "so the dc term must be nonnegative since @xmath10 .",
    "it follows from @xmath14 that @xmath15 . as a result , where the last equality follows from the positivity of @xmath12 .    ' '' ''    theorem [ thm : optimality ] states that a nonnegative signal has the least @xmath0 norm among all possible candidates which result in the same fourier magnitudes . though our focus is on the recovery of sparse signals , theorem [ thm : optimality ] does hold for general nonnegative signals and hence brings new insights to the applicable scope of the @xmath0 optimization .",
    "it is noted that the proposed @xmath0 optimization methods do not result in a unique solution .",
    "in fact , they suffer from at least the same ambiguities as existing approaches to conventional phase retrieval .",
    "for example , an optimal solution to either one of ( [ formu : lasso])-([formu : bp ] ) after a modification of constant global phase , spatial shift and/or conjugate inversion remains optimal .",
    "the augmented lagrangian alternating direction method ( adm ) solves the structured optimization problem where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are convex functions of @xmath1 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the augmented lagrangian function of the problem is given by where @xmath19 is a lagrangian multiplier and @xmath20 is a penalty parameter . starting with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the adm iterates as follows : where @xmath23 guarantees the convergence under some technical assumptions @xcite .",
    "the adm is very efficient when explicit solutions are available for ( [ formu : solvex ] ) and ( [ formu : solvez ] ) .",
    "the adm has been a popular approach to solutions of large scale problems , since it can typically produce a modestly accurate solution within a few tens of iterations though its convergence to high accuracy may be slow @xcite .",
    "problems ( [ formu : lasso])-([formu : bp ] ) are nonconvex due to the presence of the magnitude operator . in this section",
    "we solve ( [ formu : lasso])-([formu : bp ] ) using the adm .",
    "problem ( [ formu : lasso ] ) can be formulated into according to ( [ formu : admproblem ] ) , we see in this case that @xmath24 is convex while @xmath25 is nonconvex . by recognizing that the dft is unitary",
    ", @xmath1 can be explicitly updated using a soft thresholding operator ( later given in ( [ formu : xupdate_lasso ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath26 .",
    "then the augmented lagrangian involving @xmath18 is expressed as where the ` @xmath27 ' in the inequality holds if @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a constant independent of @xmath18 . as a result , the augmented lagrangian obtaines the minimum at the @xmath18 such that @xmath33 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "so the alternating direction algorithm for ( [ formu : lasso ] ) is summarized as follows : where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a soft thresholding operator with @xmath36 .",
    "next , ( [ formu : bpdn ] ) can be formulated as where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is an indicator function with @xmath39 if @xmath40 , and @xmath41 otherwise . as a result , we have @xmath24 and @xmath42 is nonconvex since the set @xmath43 is nonconvex .",
    "denote @xmath44 the projection ( in euclidean norm ) onto @xmath43 . according to the adm we obtain the algorithm for ( [ formu : bpdn ] ) which is the same as that for ( [ formu : lasso ] ) except for the update rule of @xmath18 , @xmath45 .",
    "so , provided @xmath46 we have where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is defined as before .",
    "a detailed derivation of ( [ formu : zupdate_bpdn ] ) is omitted .",
    "as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , both ( [ formu : zupdate_lasso ] ) and ( [ formu : zupdate_bpdn ] ) reduce to the following update rule of @xmath18 for solving ( [ formu : bp ] ) : while again the updates for @xmath1 and @xmath19 are the same as ( [ formu : xupdate_lasso ] ) and ( [ formu : yupdate_lasso ] ) , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the proposed adm algorithms can not be guaranteed to converge .",
    "in fact , the convergence issue remains a difficult problem in the nonconvex phase retrieval problem and a mathematically rigorous analysis has not been found for many existing algorithms for conventional phase retrieval including hio , hpr and raar @xcite .",
    "the performance of the proposed algorithms will be numerically studied in section [ sec : simulation ] , where we observe that the proposed algorithms can either converge to a good result or not converge at all .",
    "we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed adm algorithms in this section .",
    "2d random sparse images and a nonnegative satellite image shown in fig . [ fig : satellite ] are considered . due to the page limit , a thorough comparison of our method with existing approaches will be reported in a future publication .",
    "* algorithm implementation : * the algorithms start with @xmath49 and a random @xmath22 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath52 is set such that a fixed portion , @xmath53 , of the elements of @xmath54 are kept nonzero with @xmath55 .",
    "we set @xmath56 for random sparse images and @xmath57 for the satellite image .",
    "the algorithm is terminated if @xmath58 or a maximum number of iterations , 500 , is reached .    in the first simulation ,",
    "we consider random images in the noiseless case and study the success rate of recovery versus the sparsity level @xmath59 .",
    "three types of images are considered including complex , real and nonnegative ones to test whether they have different recovery performance since theorem [ thm : optimality ] holds only for nonnegative signals .",

    "an image is claimed to be correctly recovered if the relative root mean squared error ( rmse ) @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes the recovered image after removing the possible ambiguities of constant global phase , spatial shift and conjugate inversion . for each combination of @xmath59 and the image type",

    "the proposed algorithm is observed to converge to the correct solution in most trials starting from a random point .",
    "moreover , it is shown that nonnegative images have the highest success rate of recovery followed by real and then complex ones .",
