    "<S> several conclusions on the behavior of the coherent and incoherent responses can be drawn from equations ( [ e-1 ] ) and ( [ j-1 ] ) , some of them being also valid for realistic interacting systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the incoherent response @xmath35 of the free fermi gas is positive defined for all energies between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and vanishes out of this range . at fixed @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath35 is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath51 with its maximum located at @xmath52 , thus being symmetric around this point . </S>",
    "<S> hence , both @xmath35 and its derivatives are continuous .    at momentum transfer @xmath53 , @xmath47 is non  zero and negative in the range @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> it is split in two different parts , one defined at negative energies and the other at positive ones . at fixed @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> both functions are quadratic polynomials in @xmath51 that differ only in the sign of the linear coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this peculiarity gives rise to a symmetric and continuous @xmath55 that , at @xmath56 , presents both a minimum and a discontinuity in the first derivative . at @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> s greater than twice the fermi momentum , the coherent response vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> the total response @xmath57 , which is the sum of @xmath35 ( [ e-1 ] ) and @xmath47 ( [ j-1 ] ) , is the well known lindhard function @xcite,@xcite that becomes totally incoherent at @xmath58 . at @xmath50 s smaller than 2 , both the coherent and incoherent responses contribute and , even though they are of opposite sign in the free fermi gas , the total response remains always positive . </S>",
    "<S> this is a general property of the dynamic structure function of all systems , as is apparent from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aa-1 ] ) . for instance , if at a certain energy one of the two responses is negative , its absolute value has to be smaller than the value of the other one at that point , which should be positive , as this is the only way to produce a total @xmath0 that is either positive or zero .    </S>",
    "<S> this feature is particularly apparent at negative @xmath59 s , as the energy conserving delta appearing in the definition of @xmath0 ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aa-1 ] ) ) forces the non  zero contributions to appear at positive energies only . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of the response in its coherent and incoherent terms breaks this constrain and both @xmath60 and @xmath14 can locate part of their strength at @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the total response is zero in this range , @xmath14 has to be equal to @xmath62 at @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this is once again a requirement for the response derived directly from its definition , and so does not depend on the kind of system under study . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to check from equations ( [ e-1 ] ) and ( [ j-1 ] ) that this holds for the free fermi gas .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 1,2 and 3 show the total response of the free fermi gas and its incoherent and coherent parts at @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper plots show the lindhard function ( solid line ) , while @xmath35 and @xmath47 are drawn below ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are three main regions at @xmath67 where the lindhard function changes its behavior due to the different @xmath51 dependence of @xmath35 and @xmath47 . at negative </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 s lying between @xmath48 and 0 , @xmath68 and the total response vanishes . at positive energies smaller than @xmath69 , </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the two responses cancel the terms quadratic in @xmath51 ( see equations  ( [ e-1 ] ) and ( [ j-1 ] ) ) and the total @xmath57 is linear . </S>",
    "<S> finally , at @xmath70 the coherent response vanishes and the dynamic structure function becomes entirely incoherent and quadratic in @xmath51 . out of these limits </S>",
    "<S> all three functions are zero .    the different behavior of @xmath35 and @xmath47 is also reflected in figures 13 . at very low values of the momentum transfer , both @xmath35 and @xmath47 are large , but strong cancelations produce the strength of the total @xmath57 to be drastically reduced . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in this limit the region @xmath71 where @xmath57 has only incoherent contributions covers a range @xmath72 , which is much smaller than the range where the two responses coexist . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath57 looks linear in @xmath51 ( see figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath50 increases , as seen in figure 2 , both @xmath35 and @xmath47 are spread and quenched , but the former still shows a maximum well centered at @xmath52 and the latter a minimum at @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum of the coherent response coincides with the point where the two functions defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j-1 ] ) join ( @xmath56 ) , and the different value between the left and right derivatives at that point produces a peak that sharpens with increasing @xmath50 . at @xmath65 the range where the coherent response is non  </S>",
    "<S> zero becomes maximal , going from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , but the incoherent response has a wider range of existence , and the total @xmath57 presents two well differentiated regions , one linear and another quadratic in @xmath51 . as @xmath50 rises above this value , @xmath47 reduces both its magnitude and its range of definition and , in particular , at @xmath66 becomes much smaller than @xmath35 ( see figure 3 ) , thus producing a total @xmath57 that is mostly incoherent .    </S>",
    "<S> another useful tool in the study of the dynamic structure function are the energy weighted sum rules , which can be also derived for @xmath35 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> they are defined to be the moments of the different responses @xmath75 and , even though @xmath76 and @xmath77 integrate over all energies , @xmath78 , built from their sum , is an equivalent integral of the total @xmath57 but obviously restricted to positive energies .    </S>",
    "<S> the first moments read @xmath79 and are the same in a correlated system replacing @xmath80 by the appropriate static structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> for the free fermi gas , all odd moments of @xmath47 cancel due to the symmetry of the coherent response around @xmath56 , while even ones are related to derivatives of @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as @xmath35 is entirely given by the impulse approximation , all odd order incoherent moments centered at @xmath52 vanish . </S>",
    "<S> particle correlations in realistic systems may cause the static structure factor to be greater or smaller than 1 as a function of @xmath3 , as happens in liquid helium . </S>",
    "<S> even though this change in the sign of @xmath82 can be obtained from a @xmath14 symmetric around @xmath83 that has no nodes , it seems more reasonable to think about a coherent response that has at least one point where the function changes sign , located in such a way that both @xmath82 and @xmath84 are fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this difference in the behavior of the zero moment points towards a change in the structure of the coherent response entirely induced by particle correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of @xmath35 and @xmath47 at @xmath63 , moments ( [ l-1a ] ) to ( [ l-1d ] ) differ from those obtained integrating over positive energies only . </S>",
    "<S> in particular for the fermi sea , the first moments of @xmath35 integrated at @xmath85 are @xmath86 and coincide with the previous ones at @xmath58 where @xmath87 the residual terms appearing in the right hand side of equations ( [ m-1a ] ) and ( [ m-1b ] ) are the manifestation of the negative energy contributions , and are the same in realistic systems when the incoherent response is described by the impulse approximation . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in such systems the momentum distribution @xmath26 extends up to infinity , and so those terms contribute no matter how large @xmath50 is . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , @xmath26 decreases rapidly with @xmath88 and they become vanishingly small as @xmath50 increases .    in summary , a direct calculation of the coherent and incoherent density responses of the free fermi gas has revealed significant differences between them and with respect to the total dynamic structure function . while the latter is known to be non  zero and positive at @xmath89 only </S>",
    "<S> , none of those constrains apply to the coherent and incoherent responses separately . in particular , and for the fermi gas </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath14 is negative and symmetric around @xmath83 and both @xmath60 and @xmath14 present non  </S>",
    "<S> negligible contributions at @xmath90 that cancel exactly once added up . </S>",
    "<S> this cancellation also holds in any realistic system . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is also reflected in the energy weighted sum rules </S>",
