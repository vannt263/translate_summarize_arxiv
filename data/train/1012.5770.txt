    "the size distribution of main - belt asteroids ( mbas ) traces their collisional history since the formation of primitive planetesimals .",
    "previous survey observations for small solar system bodies have revealed the size distribution of mbas down to sub - km size ( ivezi et al .",
    "2001 , yoshida & nakamura 2007 , gladman et al .",
    "2009 ) . understanding the collisional processes of mbas",
    "provides insight into the initial size distribution and collisional and dynamical evolution of planetesimals in the inner protoplanetary disk .",
    "several models for collisional and orbital evolution of mbas suggest a dynamical excitation event at the final stage of the planet formation @xcite .",
    "this event produced several features seen in the current main belt , such as a high eccentricity / inclination asteroid population and the radial mixing of taxonomic classes .",
    "the dynamical excitation also ejected most asteroids out of the main belt , depleting more than 99% of the primordial mass @xcite .",
    "the relative velocities among asteroids were elevated during this phase . in the main belt ,",
    "asteroid collisions mostly occurred at higher velocities than the present average velocity of @xmath64 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the relative velocity between a body in the remnant main belt population and one in the ejected population from the main belt zone exceeded 10 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the fragment size distribution and ejecta velocities of such high - velocity collisions are still unclear ; reproduction by laboratory experiments is difficult @xcite .    in our approach to this problem , we focus on mbas with high inclination",
    ". the mean relative velocity of highly - inclined mbas at collisions with other mbas can be as large as @xmath610 km s@xmath0 @xcite . comparing the size distributions between low - inclination ( low-@xmath7 ) and high - inclination ( high-@xmath7 ) mbas could provide meaningful insight into disruptions at high velocity .",
    "for investigating high-@xmath7 mbas , several published asteroid catalogs are available , but their detection limits are no smaller than kilometer size .",
    "we performed observations for sub - km high-@xmath7 mbas to obtain their size distribution .",
    "the inclination distribution of the known mba population drops steeply at @xmath8@xmath9 , where @xmath7 is the inclination . the scarcity of high-@xmath7 mbas is due not only to the small numbers but also to an observational bias .",
    "most previous mba surveys have searched intensively around the ecliptic , but high-@xmath7 mbas only pass through the ecliptic plane briefly , spending most of their time in high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "high-@xmath7 bodies are more likely to be found at @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the heliocentric ecliptic latitude than at low ecliptic latitudes ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we surveyed high ecliptic latitudes to detect high-@xmath7 mbas .",
    "ivezi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that the surface density of asteroids in @xmath13 is only @xmath610 @xmath14 of that in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the geocentric ecliptic latitude ( a factor of 1.52 smaller than @xmath11 at opposition for mbas ) . to find a number of high-@xmath7 mbas , a wide - field survey is indispensable .",
    "we performed a wide - field survey for faint mbas using data derived from the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "in addition , efficient observation is necessary to collect large amounts of data within a limited amount of time .",
    "we adopted a less usual procedure , observing each field only two times with an interval of about 20 minutes .",

    "( 2007 ) developed a new reduction technique to find asteroids efficiently in such two - visit observation data sets .",
    "observations were conducted on june 3 2008 ( ut ) with the subaru telescope at the summit of mauna kea in hawaii .",

    "the observational fields are near r.a.(j2000 ) = , dec.(j2000 ) = corresponding to @xmath20 at opposition .",

    "the detection limit range was @xmath2 = 23.824.2 mag for moving objects whose motion corresponded to mbas ( see section 4.2 ) .",

    "the available data includes 14 fields , 3.6 deg@xmath22 ( table 1 ) .",

    "the selected data were taken where the ecliptic latitudes with respect to opposition were within @xmath24 , allowing reasonably accurate orbital estimations from the short arcs .",
    "we avoided star crowding regions around the galactic plane .",
    "each field was taken at least twice , at intervals of 5 minutes to 1 hour .",
    "we searched a total of 28 fields ( table 2 ) .",
    "the images were processed chip - by - chip using iraf produced by the national optical astronomy observatories ( noao ) .",
    "the raw data were reduced with standard processes consisting of bias subtraction , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , distortion correction , and positional correction .",
    "we also used sdfred , the software package for suprime - cam data reduction ( yagi et al .",
    "2002 , ouchi et al .",
    "2004 ) to subtract the sky background and correct for geometric distortion .    detecting a moving object from two - visit data",
    "is a three - step procedure : ( i ) masking fixed stars and galaxies in the field , ( ii ) detecting the remaining sources from the processed images , and ( iii ) removing non - object sources such as cosmic rays .",
    "first , the fixed objects were masked with the image - processing technique developed by terai et al .",
    "two types of composite images were made from raw images : one excluding smaller values of each pixel (  or \" image ) and one excluding larger values of each pixel (  and \" image ) . the or image included all objects in either of the raw images , whereas the and image consisted of only fixed objects .",
    "the and image was used to make a mask image whose pixel values were replaced with 0 for light sources and 1 for background .",
    "this was multiplied by the or image to mask the fixed objects .",
    "a moving object was recognized as a pair of light sources in the final processed image ( see fig .",
    "the remaining sources were detected with the sextractor software @xcite .",
    "the detection threshold was set to 2@xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the root - mean - square value of the background . but a large number of false sources were also identified .",
    "most were discriminated using criteria such a sharpness of the point spread function ( psf ) , velocity of motion , and direction of motion .",
    "an object pair that fulfils all of these criteria is considered a moving object candidate .",
    "finally , each candidate was inspected visually to determine whether or not it was in fact a moving object .",
    "we searched for moving objects in our observation data of 14 fields and the archival data of 28 fields . in the total area of 9.0 deg@xmath22",
    ", 656 moving objects were detected .",
    "the apparent motion of each object was measured from the shift in position between two images .",
    "figure 2 shows the apparent motion distribution of the detected objects .",
    "most of the objects have motion of @xmath63040 arcsec hr@xmath0 along the ecliptic longitude , corresponding to mbas .",
    "the smallest motion rate was 3 arcsec hr@xmath0 , equivalent to a trans - neptunian object , and the largest was 107 arcsec hr@xmath0 .",
    "highly inclined asteroids exhibited large motions in both the ecliptic longitude and latitude .",
    "the flux of each moving object was measured from the total intensity of pixels within a non - circular aperture .",
    "we used a capsule - shaped aperture given by a trail of a circle with the triple - fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) diameter in length of the motion during the exposure time .",
    "the apparent magnitude of an asteroid was estimated from the mean flux in the two images .",
    "flux calibration was conducted using several stars listed in the sdss database for our observation @xmath2-band data and the landolt standard stars for the archival @xmath26-band data . the limiting magnitude for moving objects",
    "was evaluated by artificial trails added to the raw images .",
    "they were made by imbricate pseudo point sources with the same fwhm of stars in the image .",
    "we used 100 artificial trails with brightness steps of 0.1 mag .",
    "we regarded the brightness corresponding to detection probability of 80 % as the limiting magnitude , which for our observational data was @xmath2 = 24.0 mag .",
    "this was transformed to 23.8 mag for the @xmath26-band @xcite .",
    "we used the archival data when its limiting magnitude was larger than @xmath26 = 23.8 mag . within the limiting magnitude ,",
    "the photometric error was less than 0.1 mag .",
    "to determine the orbit of an asteroid , we need at least three observations at different epochs . in this study",
    ", we could not obtain precise orbits for the detected moving objects because we observed a field only twice in a short arc of several dozen minutes .",
    "instead , we assumed a circular orbit .",
    "this enabled us to estimate the semi - major axis and inclination of a moving object from its sky motion ( bowell et al .",
    "1990 , nakamura & yoshida 2002 ) .",
    "these elements were calculated using the equations for geocentric motion rate of a moving object presented by jedicke ( 1996 ) with an eccentricity of zero .",
    "an object was excluded as an inaccurate orbit if its inclination was calculated to be larger than 40@xmath27 ( 9 objects ) .",
    "we examined the estimation accuracy using the monte carlo simulations in nakamura and yoshida ( 2002 ) .",
    "we generated 10,000 pseudo - mbas with randomly distributed orbital elements .",
    "the ranges of their semi - major axes ( @xmath28 ) , eccentricities ( @xmath29 ) , and inclinations ( @xmath7 ) were @xmath302.13.3 au , @xmath310.00.4 , and @xmath320@xmath2730@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity of each orbit was given with a probability based on the actual eccentricity distribution of known mbas .",
    "the true anomaly was set with a probability following kepler s second law .",
    "the apparent velocity of motion was calculated for a hypothetical observation field from the formulae in jedicke ( 1996 ) .",
    "then , we estimated the semi - major axis and inclination assuming a circular orbit from the velocity of motion .",
    "the accuracy of each element was represented by the standard deviations of differences between the estimated value and the given value .",
    "if the separation from opposition in ecliptic longitude was less than 15@xmath27 , the semi - major axis error was @xmath60.10.15 au for a semi - major axis range of 2.53.3 au .",
    "the error was larger than 0.15 au for semi - major axes between 2.02.5 au .",
    "the inclination accuracy depends strongly on inclination .",
    "nakamura and yoshida ( 2002 ) mentioned the degradation in inclination accuracy for @xmath33 ( the random error of inclination is more than 5@xmath27 ) .",
    "however , accuracy is improved in high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "the inclination error is 3@xmath274@xmath27 at @xmath20 where most high-@xmath7 mbas were detected .",
    "this is small enough to obtain precise size distributions for low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 mbas .    the semi - major axis distribution of the detected moving objects is shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "the distribution is concentrated between 2.0@xmath343.3 au , similar to what is known for in the main belt .",
    "we regarded 616 objects within this zone as the mba sample .",
    "the semi - major axis distribution of the sample with @xmath35 2.5 au was similar to the actual population , which had a local minimum at 2.8 au and an outer edge at 3.3 au , corresponding to the 5:2 and 2:1 mean - motion resonances ( mmr ) with jupiter , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the distribution in @xmath36 2.5 au did not appear to replicate the known distribution well .",
    "the inclination distribution is shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "the two local peaks at @xmath610@xmath27 and @xmath616@xmath27 are quite different from the known distribution in the main belt .",
    "this is because many of the surveyed fields are situated at geocentric ecliptic latitudes ( @xmath16 ) of 11@xmath27 , 17@xmath27 , and 25@xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath37 7@xmath27 , 11@xmath27 , and 16@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "this means that the highest probability mba detections occur at inclinations of around 7@xmath27 , 11@xmath27 , and 16@xmath27 ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "the distribution of semi - major axis vs. inclination is plotted in figure 4 .",
    "most bodies were located between the secular resonance @xmath38 and the 2:1 mmr , which agrees with the distribution of known mbas .",
    "the absolute magnitude of an asteroid is defined as the brightness observed at a hypothetical location of @xmath2 = 1 au and @xmath39 = 1 au with the sun , the asteroid , and earth in a straight line .",
    "it is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath42 is the apparent magnitude in a given wavelength band .",
    "the apparent magnitude is reduced by the phase angle @xmath43 , the sun - asteroid - earth angle following the phase function given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the gradient of the phase function @xcite .",

    "although these are @xmath53-band values , we applied them to @xmath2- and @xmath26-band data .    the relationship between absolute magnitude and diameter ( @xmath54 ) is described by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the magnitude of the sun , -27.29 mag in the @xmath26-band @xcite .",

    "the population ratio of s - like to c - like asteroids varies with heliocentric distance .",
    "yoshida and nakamura ( 2007 ) showed that the ratio for asteroids of @xmath61 0.6 km are 1:1 in the inner belt ( 2.02.6 au ) , 1:2.3 in the middle belt ( 2.63.0 au ) , and 1:4 in the outer belt ( 3.03.5 au ) .",
    "we estimated the mean albedo in each of the three zones from the population ratio and mean albedos of the s - like and c - like mbas .",
    "we adopted the mean albedos as ( @xmath59+@xmath60)/(1 + 1 ) = 0.14 for 2.0 @xmath62 2.6 au , ( @xmath59 + 2.3@xmath60)/(1 + 2.3 ) = 0.11 for 2.6 @xmath62 3.0 au , and ( @xmath59 + 4@xmath60)/(1 + 4 ) = 0.10 for 3.0 @xmath62 3.3 au .",
    "although , as discussed in section 5.2.2 , the population of s - like mbas is small in high inclination , the difference is negligible with respect to mean albedos .",
    "the absolute magnitude is converted to diameter using these albedo values and eq.(4 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the diameter distribution for the detected mbas .",

    "considering the photometric error of @xmath60.1 mag and semi - major axis error of @xmath60.1 au , the inaccuracy of diameter estimation is about 15% .",
    "when the error on the albedo ( @xmath60.06 ) is included , the added inaccuracy is 15% .",
    "the detected mba sample included some observational bias , which had to be removed .",
    "the most remarkable bias was a decrease in detection probabilities for faint objects .",
    "the limiting magnitude ( 24.0 mag in the @xmath2-band or 23.8 mag in the @xmath26-band ) corresponded to @xmath54 = 0.7 km at a semi - major axis of 3.3 au with a typical phase angle of 25@xmath27 and a typical albedo of 0.1 .",
    "we regarded asteroids with @xmath61 0.7 km as the sample for estimating size distribution .",
    "in addition , we excluded asteroids with @xmath36 2.5 au for two reasons . first , this zone contains only a small population of high-@xmath7 mbas and s - like asteroids are abundant in this region , unlike in the outer zone .",
    "if these asteroids were included in the sample , the fraction of s - like asteroids would differ significantly from the low-@xmath7 to high-@xmath7 mbas .",

    "2001 , yoshida & nakamura 2007 , wiegert et al .",
    "an excess of s - like population in the low-@xmath7 mbas could cause a bias in comparing size distributions between low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 mbas .",
    "this bias is discussed again in section 5.2.2 .",
    "second , the estimated semi - major axis for an asteroid with @xmath36 2.5 au has a large error ( @xmath630.15 au ) . ultimately , 178 asteroids with @xmath61 0.7 km were selected in @xmath28 = 2.53.3 au .",

    "the csd slope of each sample from 0.7 km to 50 km in diameter was @xmath70 = 2.17 @xmath3 0.02 for low-@xmath7 mbas and @xmath70 = 2.02 @xmath3 0.03 for high-@xmath7 mbas .",

    "for confirmation we adjusted the high-@xmath7 csd to the low-@xmath7 csd at @xmath54 = 50 km , and its power - law index was transformed to the same value as the low-@xmath7 csd ( see fig 10 ) .",

    "the @xmath87-value is @xmath122 16.2 much greater than @xmath123 ( 2.43 ) , which rejected the null hypothesis at the 99% confidence level .",

    "collisional fragmentation is characterized by impact strength , @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath124 is the critical specific energy to fragment the target and disperse half of its mass .",
    "it depends on asteroid size , generally expressed as @xmath125 the @xmath124 curve has two different power laws with opposite signs . for small bodies , @xmath124 decreases with increasing diameter ( @xmath126 ) , in what is called the strength - scaled regime .",
    "in contrast , strength increases with increasing diameter ( @xmath127 ) for large bodies , in what is called the gravity - scaled regime .",
    "the two slopes join at the transition diameter ( @xmath128 ) of 0.11 km @xcite . obrien and greenberg ( 2003 ) showed that the power - law index of the csd with @xmath129 is determined by the power - law index of the @xmath124 curve in the gravity - scaled regime , @xmath130 . according to the collisional steady - state scenario ,",
    "this relationship is described by @xmath131    in the present study , the overall csd slope of high-@xmath7 mbas ( @xmath70 = 2.02 ) was smaller than that of low-@xmath7 mbas ( @xmath70 = 2.17 ) , corresponding to @xmath130 = 0.91 and @xmath130 = 1.43 , respectively .",
    "the most remarkable difference between the low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 mbas was collision velocity .",
    "the mean relative velocity among mbas , most of which are low-@xmath7 bodies , is 3.8 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , high-@xmath7 mbas often collide at high velocities , around 10 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "benz and asphaug ( 1999 ) performed impact simulations for basalt at two different collision velocities , 3 km s@xmath0 and 5 km s@xmath0 , and found that @xmath130 did not vary between the two velocities .",
    "however , jutzi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , using impact simulations , reported that the @xmath130 of basalt targets for 5 km s@xmath0 ( @xmath130 = 1.29 ) was smaller than that for 3 km s@xmath0 ( @xmath130 = 1.33 ) .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath70 = 2.06 and @xmath70 = 2.05 , respectively .",
    "this difference is too small to be recognized through observations .",
    "their results showed that @xmath130 does not depend strongly on collisional velocity enough to shift @xmath70 .",
    "but the relationship between the @xmath124 curve and collision velocity , especially in the hypervelocity collisions around 10 km s@xmath0 , is still uncertain .",
    "our study might present evidence for an increase in @xmath130 in hypervelocity collisions around 10 km s@xmath0 .      examined qualitatively ,",
    "it is possible that the different spatial distributions between taxonomic groups caused the discrepancy in the csd slopes between low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 mbas .",
    "the population ratio of s - like to c - like asteroids is not uniform with inclination .",
    "moth - diniz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that a smaller fraction of s - complex mbas with @xmath61 7 km appears in the high eccentricity / inclination regime . meanwhile , several observations have indicated different csd slopes for different taxonomic groups , mostly in low inclination ( ivezi et al .",
    "2001 , yoshida & nakamura 2007 , wiegert et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this difference in abundance between the taxonomic groups could induce an apparent decrease in the csd slope in high inclination .",
    "we checked this effect using the sdss moc data .",
    "the sdss asteroids were separated into s - like and c - like groups by @xmath132 color defined in eq.(6 ) .",

    "the csd slope of high-@xmath7 mbas was not as small as that of the observed csd .",
    "consequently , these results show that a small ( compound ) slope @xmath70 in the high-@xmath7 mbas requires a smaller s - type slope @xmath133 for that region . in model 2",

    "the test was performed assuming that high-@xmath7 mbas have the same population ratio as low-@xmath7 mbas .",
    "the csd power - law indexes were set to match the sdss moc data , ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) = ( 2.66 , 2.41 ) for low-@xmath7 mbas and ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) = ( 2.26 , 2.36 ) for high-@xmath7 mbas .",

    "this indicates that the scarcity of s - like asteroids with high inclination had little influence on the csd slope .",
    "we conclude that the shallow csd of the high-@xmath7 mbas was due to the small csd slope of s - like mbas with high inclination .",
    "we suggest that @xmath130 values for high - velocity collisions ( around 10 km s@xmath0 ) of s - like asteroids are large , while @xmath130 values for similar c - like asteroids are not .",
    "one possible cause is the variation in porosities between s - like and c - like asteroids .",
    "c - type asteroids have porosities of 3560% , whereas s - type asteroids have porosities of around 30% @xcite .",
    "jutzi et al .",

    "note that these considerations include uncertainty .",
    "the wavy structure of the csd may differ between s - like and c - like mbas . estimating the csd slopes from a narrow size range is not appropriate for comparing the overall slope @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , previous surveys have presented a variety of results .",
    "ivezi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed @xmath70 = 3.00 @xmath3 0.05 for both groups with @xmath136 5 km , and @xmath70 = 1.20 @xmath3 0.05 for s - like asteroids and @xmath70 = 1.40 @xmath3 0.05 for c - like asteroids with @xmath137 5 km .",

    "dynamical processes , as well as collisional processes , affect the shape of the csd . obrien and greenberg ( 2005 ) showed via numerical simulations that the csd slope of mbas is reduced from @xmath620 km in diameter through the action of the yarkovsky effect and resonances .",
    "the yarkovsky effect causes a drift in the semi - major axis , the rate of change of which increases with decreasing size down to 0.01 km in diameter .",
    "asteroids caught in a strong resonance are removed from the main belt .",
    "smaller asteroids are removed more quickly from the main belt .",
    "although the yarkovsky effect is independent of inclination , several secular resonances appear at high inclination . within the heliocentric distance of 2.53.3 au , none of these resonances appear at @xmath66 . in contrast , the strong secular resonances of @xmath138 , @xmath38 , and @xmath139 lie in @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "high-@xmath7 asteroids in this zone are subject to removal .",
    "these secular resonances together with the yarkovsky effect could cause significant losses of high-@xmath7 mbas , possibly enough to diminish the csd slope .",
    "this action increases the difference in @xmath70 between the low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 mbas at small sizes ( @xmath140 km ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure 10 , the difference in @xmath70 is almost constant as the diameter decreases from @xmath141 km .",
    "this is inconsistent with the above expectation .",
    "hence , dynamical removal does not decrease @xmath70 in high inclination .",

    "\\(1 ) a smaller fraction of small asteroids ( 0.7 km @xmath71 1 km ) appear in high inclination .",
    "the power - law index of the csd for the 0.72 km diameter range is 1.79 @xmath3 0.05 for low-@xmath7 mbas ( @xmath142 ) and 1.62 @xmath3 0.07 for high-@xmath7 ( @xmath143 ) mbas .",
    "the sub - km asteroids at @xmath143 have a lower index than the low-@xmath7 sample at the 95% confidence level based in a statistical @xmath87-test .",
    "\\(2 ) the single power - law slope of the combined csd for diameter in the 0.750 km range is 2.17 @xmath3 0.02 for the low-@xmath7 mbas and 2.02 @xmath3 0.03 for the high-@xmath7 mbas .",
    "the high-@xmath7 csd is shallower than the low-@xmath7 csd for the entire size range at the 99% confidence level .",
    "this is not caused by the difference in the wavy pattern of the csds .",
    "\\(3 ) the csd of s - like asteroids has a small slope in high inclination , whereas that of c - like asteroids shows little variation in slope with inclination . through modeling",
    "we showed that the shallow csd of the high-@xmath7 mbas is not caused by the spatial distribution of the taxonomic groups , but by the shallow csd of the s - like mbas with high inclination .",
    "\\(4 ) the difference in slope of csds between the low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 mbas is constant across @xmath144 km .",
    "the shallow csd of the high-@xmath7 mbas is not the result of dynamical removal due to the yarkovsky effect and the secular resonances .",
    "we suggest that the small @xmath70 of s - like mbas with high inclination is due to a collisional effect .",
    "the possible explanation is that the @xmath124 curve has a large gravity - scaled regime @xmath130 slope under hypervelocity collisions ( around 10 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "asteroid collisions often occurred with such high velocities in the dynamical excitation phase in the final stage of planet formation .",
    "we suppose that during this phase , mbas experienced oligopolistic collisional evolution ; small bodies were more easily disrupted relative to large bodies than at present .",
