    "since the rebirth of non - commutative quantum field theory @xcite , people encountered a major difficulty . a new kind of divergences appeared in non - commutative field theory @xcite , the uv / ir mixing .",
    "it is a kind of infrared divergence which appears after integrating the high scale variables and ca nt be eliminated .",
    "it lead people to declare such theories non - renormalizable . but",
    "a real breakthrough of that deadlock came from h.grosse and r.wulkenhaar @xcite .",
    "they found that the right propagator for the scalar field theory in non - commutative space should be modified to obey the langmann - szabo duality @xcite . in a series of paper they proved that the @xmath2 scalar field theory in 4 dimensional moyal plane , @xmath3 for short , is renormalizable to all orders using polchinski s equation @xcite in the matrix base .",
    "rigorous estimates on the propagator required by the grosse - wulkenhaar analysis and a more explicit multiscale analysis were provided in @xcite . then gurau et al",
    ". gave another proof that the non - commutative @xmath3 is renormalizable , also with a multiscale analysis but completely in position space @xcite .",
    "the corresponding parametric representation of the model was also built in @xcite .",
    "recently the model has been shown to have no landau ghost , so that it is actually better behaved than its commutative counterpart @xcite and can presumably be built non perturbatively .",
    "apart from the @xmath3 theory , many other theories in non - commutative space have now also been proved to be renormalizable to all orders , such as the gross - neveu model in 2 dimensional moyal plane @xcite , the lsz model @xcite and the @xmath4 theory in various dimensional space @xcite . for an updated review ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we prove that the orientable non - commutative complex @xmath5 field theory , @xmath6 for short , in @xmath7 dimensional space , with two dimensions equipped with non - commutative moyal product and the third one which commutes with the two others , is renormalisable to all orders of perturbation theory . in the first section we derive the propagator and establish the @xmath1-space power counting of the theory . in the second section",
    "we prove that the divergent subgraphs can be renormalized by counterterms of the form of the initial lagrangian .",
    "our proof , based solely on @xmath1 space with multiscale analysis , follows closely the strategy of @xcite . for technical reasons ,",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the simpler orientable case , but we plan to study the nonorientable case or real scalar @xmath0 model as well .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that the quantum hall effect at finite temperature should also be described by a 2 + 1 dimensional field theory with two anticommuting space and one commuting imaginary time coordinates @xcite .",
    "our model is therefore a first step towards understanding how to renormalize such theories .",

    "the position routing associated to the tree @xmath62 solves this system by passing to another equivalent system of @xmath70 linear equations , one for each branch of the tree .",
    "this equivalent system is obtained by summing the arguments of the @xmath52 functions of the vertices in each branch . to do this we firstly fix a particular branch @xmath66 , with its subtree @xmath72 . in the branch sum",

    "obviously the jacobian of this transformation is 1 , so we simply get another equivalent set of @xmath70 @xmath52 functions , one for each branch .",
    "for instance in the particular case of figure [ fig : exbranch ] , the delta function is @xmath78        for an orientable graph , the position routing is summarised by :    we have , calling @xmath79 the remaining integrand in ( [ amplitude ] ) : @xmath80 } \\\\ & & \\prod_{v_6}{[}\\delta(x_{v,1}-x_{v,2}+x_{v,3}-x_{v,4}+x_{v,5}-x_{v,6}){]}i_g(\\{x_{v , i},x^{0}_{v , i}\\})\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int \\prod_{b}\\delta \\left(\\sum_{l\\in t_b \\cup l_b } u_{l }   + \\sum_{f\\in x_b}\\epsilon(f ) x_f\\right)i_g(\\{x_{v , i},x^{0}_{v , i } \\})\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is @xmath82 depending on whether the field @xmath69 enters or exits the branch .    using the above equations one can at least solve all the long tree variables @xmath74 in terms of external variables , short variables and long loop variables , using the @xmath63 non - root branches .",
    "there remains then the root branch @xmath52 function .",
    "if @xmath66 is orientable , this @xmath52 function of branch @xmath65 contains only short and external variables .",
    "here we should nt forget that each external variable can be written as linear combination of short variable and long variable .",
    "if @xmath66 is non - orientable one can solve for an additional  clashing \" long loop variable .",
    "we can summarise these observations in the following lemma just like that in @xcite :    [ lemmarouting ] the position routing solves any long tree variable @xmath74 as a function of :    * the short tree variable @xmath73 of the line @xmath44 itself , * the short tree and loop variables with both ends in @xmath83 , * the short and long variables of the loop lines with one end inside @xmath83 and the other outside , * the true external variables @xmath1 hooked to @xmath83 .    in the orientable case",
    "the root branch @xmath52 function contains only short tree variables , short loop variables and external variables but no long variables , hence gives a linear relation among the short variables and external positions . in the non - orientable case it gives a linear relation between the long variables @xmath84 of all the clashing loops in the graph some short variables @xmath85 s and all the external positions .    from now on ,",
    "each time we use this lemma to solve the long tree variables @xmath74 in terms of the other variables , we shall call @xmath86 rather than @xmath74 the remaining @xmath87 independent long loop variables . hence looking at the long variables names the reader can check whether lemma [ lemmarouting ] has been used or not . [ filkreduc1 ]      in this section we follow the standard procedure of multiscale analysis @xcite .",
    "first the parametric integral for the propagator is sliced in the usual way : @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90    we have an associated decomposition of any amplitude of the theory as @xmath91    for some constants @xmath92 ( large ) and @xmath93 ( small ) : @xmath94 } \\ ] ] ( which a posteriori justifies the terminology of  long \" and  short \" variables ) .",
    "we can use the second order approximation of the hyperbolic functions near the origin to prove this lemma .",
    "taking absolute values , hence neglecting all oscillations , leads to the following crude bound : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the standard assignment of an integer index @xmath97 to each propagator of each internal line @xmath44 of the graph @xmath42 , which represents its  scale \" .",
    "we will consider only amputated graphs .",
    "therefore we have only external vertices of the graph ; in the renormalization group spirit , the convenient convention is to assign all external indices of these external fields to a fictitious @xmath98  background \" scale .    to any assignment @xmath96 and scale @xmath99",
    "are associated the standard connected components @xmath100 , @xmath101 of the subgraph @xmath102 made of all lines with scales @xmath103 .",
    "these components are partially ordered according to their inclusion relations and the ( abstract ) tree describing these inclusion relations is called the gallavotti - nicol tree @xcite ; its nodes are the @xmath100 s and its root is the complete graph @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely for an arbitrary subgraph @xmath9 one defines : @xmath104 the subgraph @xmath9 is a @xmath100 for a given @xmath96 if and only if @xmath105 .",
    "now we should choose the real tree @xmath62 compatible with the abstract gallavotti - nicol tree to optimise the bound over spatial integrations , which means that the restriction @xmath106 of @xmath62 to any @xmath107 must still span @xmath107 .",
    "this is always possible ( by a simple induction from leaves to root ) .",
    "we pick such a compatible tree @xmath62 and use it both to orient the graph as in the previous section and to solve the associated branch system of @xmath52 functions according to lemma [ lemmarouting ] .",
    "we obtain : @xmath108 } \\prod_b\\delta_b    \\ ; \\nonumber\\\\ \\les   k^n\\prod_l m^{i_l}\\int\\prod_l du_l du^{0}_l dw_l   e^{-c \\big [ m^{i_l}\\vert u_l \\vert + m^{i_l}\\vert u^{0 } \\vert + m^{-i_l } \\vert v_l ( u , w , x ) \\vert \\big ] } \\delta_{b_0}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then we can find that any long variable integrated at scale @xmath99 costs @xmath109 .the integration over the non - commutative short variable at scale @xmath99 brings @xmath110 , and the commutative one brings @xmath111 ( there is no long variable in the commutative dimension ) so the integration over each tree line at scale @xmath99 brings a total convergent factor @xmath112 .",
    "the variables  solved \" by the @xmath52 functions bring or cost nothing . for an orientable graph we should solve the @xmath63 long variables @xmath74 s of the tree propagators in terms of the other variables ,",
    "because this is the maximal number of long variables that we can solve , and they have highest possible indices because @xmath62 has been chosen compatible with the gallavotti - nicol tree structure . we should study more carefully the commutative variable which is the @xmath113 dimension of any tree line of @xmath62 . while the model for the non - commutative variables is non local , it is local for the commutative variables .",
    "so we ca nt integrate over all the position variables ( or the equivalent line variables ) but have to save one , the root ( we name it @xmath114 ) .",
    "we will use this point when we perform the renormalisation where the amputed amplitude of any connected component depends only on one commutative external position @xmath114 .",
    "this point is also very important for the power counting of the non - orientable model as it implies the maximal number of commutative short variable we can integrate over is @xmath63 not @xmath70 .",
    "finally we still have the last @xmath115 function ( equivalent to the overall momentum conservation in the commutative case ) .",
    "it is optimal to use it to solve one external variable ( if any ) in terms of all the short variables and the external ones . since",
    "external variables are typically smeared against unit scale test functions , this leaves power counting invariant .",
    "we now define @xmath116 the set of long variables to be solved via the @xmath52 functions hence the set of @xmath63 tree lines as there are only orientable graphs in our model .",
    "gathering all the corresponding factors together with the propagators prefactors @xmath117 leads to the following bound : @xmath118    in the usual way of @xcite we write @xmath119 and @xmath120 and we must now only count the number of elements in @xmath121 .    as remarked above @xmath122 , and the cardinal of @xmath123 is @xmath124",
    ".    using the fact that @xmath125 we can summarise these results in the following lemma :    [ crudelemma ] the following bound holds for a connected graph of @xmath6 model ( with external arguments integrated against fixed smooth test functions ) : @xmath126 for some ( large ) constant @xmath92 , with @xmath127    this lemma proves the power counting for orientable graphs .",
    "but it is not yet sufficient for a renormalization theorem to all orders of perturbation .",
    "indeed only planar graphs with a single broken face look like moyal products when their internal indices become much higher than their external ones .",
    "so we must prove that the non - planar graphs or graphs with more than one broken face have better power counting than what lemma [ crudelemma ] states .",
    "vertices oscillations should be taken into account to prove that , and this is done in the next section .",
    "recall that for any non - commutative feynman graph @xmath42 we can define the genus of the graph , called @xmath9 and the number of faces  broken by external legs \" , called @xmath128 @xcite . for a general graph",
    ", we have @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    in the previous section we established that @xmath131 the subgraphs with @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    "are called _ planar regular_. we want to prove that they are the only non - vacuum graphs with @xmath134 .",
    "it is easy to check that planar regular subgraphs are orientable , but the converse is not true . to prove that _ orientable non - planar _ subgraphs or _ orientable planar _",
    "subgraphs with @xmath135 are irrelevant requires to use a bit of the vertices oscillations to improve lemma [ crudelemma ] and get :    [ improvedbound ] for orientable subgraphs with @xmath136 we have @xmath137 for orientable subgraphs with @xmath138 and @xmath135 we have @xmath139    this lemma is sufficient for the purpose of this paper .",
    "it implies directly that graphs which contain only irrelevant subgraphs have finite amplitudes which are uniformly bounded by @xmath140 , using the standard method of @xcite to bound the assignment sum over @xmath96 in ( [ assignsum ] ) .    the rest of this subsection is essentially devoted to the proof of this lemma .",
    "we return before solving @xmath52 functions , hence to the @xmath141 variables .",
    "we will need only to compute the oscillations which are quadratic in the long variables @xmath141 s to prove ( [ improvednonplanar ] ) and the linear oscillations in @xmath142 to prove ( [ improvedbrokenfaces ] ) .",
    "fortunately an analog problem was solved in momentum space by filk and chepelev - roiban @xcite , and adapted to position routing by gurau et al .",
    "we just borrow from the method of @xcite .",
    "as the procedures for our paper are almost the same as that for @xmath143 in @xcite , we reproduce the argument as concisely as possible , and we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "the short variables are inessential in this subsection , as the integration of them always bring about convergent terms .",
    "but it is convenient to treat on the same footing the long @xmath141 and the external @xmath1 variables , so we introduce a new global notation @xmath144 for all these variables . then the vertices rewrite as @xmath145 for some inessential signs @xmath146 and some symplectic matrices @xmath147 and @xmath148 . as there are no oscillations for the commutative coordinates , there are no filk moves for them .",
    "since the precise oscillations in the short @xmath85 variables is not important to this problem , we will note in the sequel @xmath149 any linear combination of the @xmath85 variables .",
    "let s consider the first filk reduction @xcite , which contracts tree lines of the graph .",
    "it creates progressively generalised vertices with even number of fields . at a given induction step and for a tree line joining two such generalised vertices with respectively @xmath150 and @xmath151 fields ( suppose @xmath150 is even and @xmath152 is odd ) , we assume by induction that the two vertices are @xmath153 using the second @xmath52 function we see that : @xmath154 substituting this expression in the first @xmath52 function we get : @xmath155    the quadratic terms which include @xmath156 in the exponential are ( taking into account that @xmath150 is an even number ) : @xmath157 using the expression ( [ solveyp ] ) for @xmath156 we see that the second term gives only terms in @xmath158 , as @xmath159 is antisymmetry .",
    "the first term yields : @xmath160 which reconstitutes the crossed terms , and we have recovered the inductive form of the larger generalised vertex .    after each filk move we will have two more vertices . so by this procedure we will always treat only even vertices .",
    "we finally rewrite the product of the two vertices as : @xmath161 where the exponential is written in terms of the _ reindexed _ vertex variables . in this way we can contract all lines of a spanning tree @xmath62 and reduce @xmath42 to a single vertex with  tadpole loops \" called a  rosette graph \" @xcite . in this rosette to keep track of cyclicity is essential so we draw the rosette as a cycle ( which is the border of the former tree ) bearing loops lines on it ( see figure [ fig : exrosette ] ) .",
    "remark that the rosette can also be considered as a big vertex , with @xmath162 fields , on which @xmath57 are external fields with external variables @xmath1 and @xmath163 are loop fields for the corresponding @xmath164 loops . when the graph is orientable , the long variables @xmath165 for @xmath44 in @xmath62 will disappear in the rosette .",
    "let us call @xmath166 the set of remaining long loop and external variables .",
    "then the rosette vertex factor is @xmath167    we can go on performing inductively the first filk move and the net effect is simply to rewrite the root branch @xmath52 function and the combination of all vertices oscillations ( using the other @xmath52 functions ) as the new big vertex or rosette factor ( [ rosettefactor ] ) .",
    "the second filk reduction @xcite further simplifies the rosette factor by erasing the loops of the rosette which do not cross any other loops or arch over external fields .",
    "putting together all the terms in the exponential which contain @xmath168 we conclude exactly as in @xcite that these long @xmath166 variables completely disappear from the rosette oscillation factor , which simplifies as in @xcite to @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the antisymmetric  intersection matrix \" of @xcite ( up to a different sign convention ) . here",
    "@xmath171 if oriented loop line @xmath99 crosses oriented loop line @xmath172 coming from its right , @xmath173 if @xmath99 crosses @xmath172 coming from its left , and @xmath174 if @xmath99 and @xmath172 do not cross .",
    "these formulas are also true for @xmath99 external line and @xmath172 loop line or the converse , provided one extends the external lines from the rosette circle radially to infinity to see their crossing with the loops .",
    "finally when @xmath99 and @xmath172 are external lines one should define @xmath175 if @xmath150 and @xmath152 are the numbering of the lines on the rosette cycle ( starting from an arbitrary origin ) .",
    "if a node @xmath176 of the gallavotti - nicol tree is orientable but non - planar ( @xmath177 ) , there must therefore exist at least two intersecting loop lines in the rosette corresponding to this @xmath178 , with long variables @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "moreover since @xmath176 is orientable , none of the long loop variables associated with these two lines belongs to the set @xmath116 of long variables eliminated by the @xmath52 constraints .",
    "therefore , after integrating the variables in @xmath116 the basic mechanism to improve the power counting of a single non planar subgraph is the following : @xmath181 in these equations we used for simplicity @xmath182 instead of the correct but more complicated factor @xmath183 ( see [ tanhyp ] ) ( of course this does not change the argument ) and we performed a unitary linear change of variables @xmath184 , @xmath185 to compute the oscillating @xmath186 integral .",
    "the gain in ( [ gainoscill ] ) is @xmath187 , which is the difference between @xmath188 and the normal factor @xmath189 that would be generated by the integrals over @xmath179 and @xmath180 if there were not the oscillation term @xmath190 .",
    "so after the integration of the non - commutative part of the two clashing lines the gain is almost @xmath191 .",
    "this basic argument must then be generalised to each non - planar leaf in the gallavotti - nicol tree . actually , in any orientable non - planar  primitive \" @xmath178 node ( i.e. not containing sub non - planar nodes ) we can choose an arbitrary pair of crossing loop lines which will be integrated as in ( [ gainoscill ] ) using this oscillation .",
    "the corresponding improvements are independent .",
    "this leads to an improved amplitude bound : @xmath192 where now @xmath193 if @xmath178 is orientable and non planar ( i.e. @xmath194 ) .",
    "this bound proves ( [ improvednonplanar ] ) .",
    "finally it remains to consider the case of nodes @xmath178 which are planar orientable but with @xmath195 . in that case",
    "there are no crossing loops in the rosette but there must be at least one loop line arching over a non trivial subset of external legs in the @xmath178 rosette ( see line 6 in figure [ fig : exrosette ] ) .",
