    "the elm survey has so far discovered 55 binaries , all with @xmath7 d , including 32 that will merge within a hubble time @xcite .",

    "@xcite identified 0931  as a uv - excess object in the palomar schmidt plates , and @xcite confirmed it as a da wd based on optical spectroscopy .",

    "however , there seems to be a systematic effect that leads to overestimating the m dwarf distances in da + m systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the distance estimates for the wds and m dwarfs in the 58 post - common - envelope - binaries presented in @xcite differ by as much as 3@xmath17 .",
    "hence , the inconsistent distance estimates for the wd and m dwarf do not rule out physical association . @xcite also point out that the m dwarf in 0931  has a poorly defined na i doublet , possibly due to orbital motion .",
    "if so , the relatively hot wd would cause significant heating of the secondary star , which would be detected as a reflection effect in the optical lightcurve .",

    "when the mass transfer starts , 0931 will most likely have unstable mass transfer @xcite .",
    "however , the merger outcome is uncertain because of the unknown inclination angle and the companion mass . for a relatively high inclination angle of @xmath50",
    ", the companion would be a very low - mass wd with @xmath51 , and the merger will lead to a single he - burning subdwarf star . for an inclination of @xmath52 , 0931  would be an equal mass binary with a merger time of 4.4 myr , and @xmath53 .",
    "this is similar to the gravitational wave strain from the verification binary hp lib @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of the secondary wd in our spectroscopy implies that the companion is cooler ( like cs 41177 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or more massive ( like j0651 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the gravitational wave strain of 0931  may be even higher than this estimate , potentially making it one of the best verification sources known .",
    "there is growing interest in triples containing an inner double wd binary .",
    "@xcite suggest that mass loss in an evolving triple system leads to orbital instability , triggering close encounters or collisions in the system .",
    "this mechanism could explain prompt supernovae ia , and contribute to the ia event rate @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find this rate to be low .    to explore the eccentricity of the 0931  binary , we fit both circular and eccentric orbits to the radial velocity data .",
    "the 3@xmath17 upper limit on eccentricity is @xmath54 , and the @xcite test strongly prefers a circular orbit .",
    "this suggests that the kozai mechanism is not important for 0931 , and we are yet to find a triple system containing an eccentric double wd inner binary .",
    "given the size of the orbit ( 0.19 ) , and the lack of evidence for mass transfer and a reflection effect , the m dwarf that contaminates the sdss spectrum of 0931  can not be a member of the 20 min period binary .",
    "the distance estimate also puts the m dwarf significantly further away than the wd , though the distance uncertainty is rather large .",
    "cross - correlating with a template spectrum of an inactive m1 dwarf @xcite",
    ", we measure velocities of @xmath55 and @xmath56  for the na i doublet from the gemini and mmt spectra , respectively . these are significantly different than the systemic velocity of the wd binary ( 74.3 @xmath16 2.3 ) .",
    "hence , the m dwarf is likely a background source .",
    "based on six epochs from the usno - b and the sdss , @xcite measure a proper motion of ( @xmath57 ) mas yr@xmath18 .",
    "0931  is unresolved in the palomar plates and the sdss images .",
    "if the proper motion measurement is correct , 0931  would have moved only 1@xmath20 between the first palomar observations and the sdss .",
    "hence , the current proper motion measurements are inconclusive in deciding if the m dwarf is the tertiary component of the 0931 system .",
    "if the m dwarf is a background object , the hubble space telescope observations may be able to resolve the wd and the m dwarf and confirm or rule out any physical association based on common proper motion .",
    "we identify 0931  as a new _ elisa _ verification source , only the ninth such system known .",
    "0931  is a 20 min orbital period detached binary wd , the second - quickest merger system currently known .",
    "it contains a 0.32  wd and a @xmath1  companion . the m dwarf in this system may or",
    "may not be associated with 0931 , and we propose follow - up proper motion measurements to distinguish between the two scenarios . since the companion wd is not detected in our spectroscopy or photometry , it is likely cooler and/or more massive than the elm wd .",
    "a more massive companion would make it one of the strongest sources of gravitational radiation currently known .",
