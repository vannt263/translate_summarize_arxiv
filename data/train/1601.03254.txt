    "there is a growing literature on the formalization and representation of topological questions ; see @xcite for a survey of the field .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of the self - affine sets is the _ connectedness _ , which roughly means the attractor can not be written as a disjoint union of two pieces .",
    "this property is important in computer vision and remote sensing @xcite .",
    "we mention that connected self - affine fractals are curves ; thus , they are sometimes referred to as self - affine curves @xcite .",
    "there is some motivation for studying connected self - affine tiles because they are related to number systems , wavelets , torus maps .",
