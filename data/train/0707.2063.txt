    "<S> however , the high quality factors achievable for microwave cavities and the good sensitivity of microwave detectors allow for a projected sensitivity for photon - paraphoton mixing of the order of @xmath0 to @xmath1 , for paraphotons with masses in the @xmath2 to @xmath3 range  exceeding the current laboratory- and astrophysics - based limits by several orders of magnitude </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , this experiment bears significant discovery potential for hidden sector physics .    </S>",
    "<S> extensions of the standard model often contain extra u(1 ) gauge degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> if the corresponding additional gauge bosons have direct renormalizable couplings to standard model matter , they are usually referred to as @xmath4-bosons . </S>",
    "<S> negative collider searches for the latter have constrained their mass to @xmath5 , for couplings of weak or electromagnetic strength  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in many cases , notably in realistic string - based scenarios standard model matter is uncharged under the additional u(1 ) symmetry and the corresponding gauge boson belongs to a `` hidden sector '' , typically interacting with the standard model particles only via feeble gravity - like interactions . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the only renormalizable interaction with the standard model visible sector can occur via mixing  @xcite of the photon @xmath6 with the hidden sector photon @xmath7 , often dubbed `` paraphoton '' . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the sensitivity of collider experiments to photon mixing is extremely limited , in particular if the hidden sector photon has a small mass in the sub - ev range . </S>",
    "<S> presently , the best laboratory limits on a low mass paraphoton and its mixing with the photon arise from cavendish - type tests of the coulomb law  @xcite and from the search for signals of @xmath6@xmath7 oscillations with laser `` light shining through a wall '' experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best astrophysical limits come from considerations of the energy balance of stars , in particular the sun , and from the non - observation of photon regeneration in helioscopes  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a laboratory experiment to search for signatures of @xmath6@xmath7 oscillations by exploiting high - quality microwave cavities . </S>",
    "<S> our setup seems to be realizable with current technology and has a large window of opportunity for the discovery of low mass , @xmath8 , hidden sector photons , exceeding the current limits on @xmath6@xmath7 mixing by several orders of magnitude .    for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider an extension of the standard model where one has , at low energies , say much below the electron mass , in addition to the familiar electromagnetic u(1)@xmath9 , another hidden - sector u(1)@xmath10 under which all standard model particles have zero charge . </S>",
    "<S> this may occur quite generally in string embeddings of the standard model ( for general reviews , see e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , no matter whether they are based on compactifications of heterotic ( e.g.  @xcite ) , iia </S>",
    "<S> ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and iib ( e.g.  @xcite ) string theory . </S>",
    "<S> the most general renormalizable lagrangian describing these two u(1 ) s at low energies is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the field strength tensor for the ordinary electromagnetic u(1)@xmath9 gauge field @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the field strength for the hidden - sector u(1)@xmath10 field @xmath15 , i.e. , the paraphoton . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms are the standard kinetic terms for the photon and paraphoton fields , respectively . because the field strength itself is gauge invariant for u(1 ) gauge fields , the third term is also allowed by gauge and lorentz symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this term corresponds to a non - diagonal kinetic term , a so - called kinetic mixing  @xcite . from the viewpoint of a low - energy effective lagrangian </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 is a completely arbitrary parameter . embedding the model into a more fundamental theory , </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that @xmath17 holds at a high - energy scale related to the fundamental theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , integrating out the heavy quantum fluctuations generally tends to generate non - vanishing  @xmath16 at low scales . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , kinetic mixing arises quite generally both in field theoretic  @xcite as well as in string theoretic  @xcite setups . </S>",
    "<S> the last term in the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) accounts for a possible mass of the paraphoton . </S>",
    "<S> this may arise from the breaking of the paraphoton u(1)@xmath10 via a higgs mechanism and choosing unitary gauge , or , alternatively , may be just an explicit stckelberg mass term  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ limits ] ) .        </S>",
    "<S> before we start with a detailed calculation , let us present a simple estimate based on a comparison with the familiar `` light shining through a wall '' setup , which exploits an optical cavity and a laser with wavelength @xmath42 . in optical cavities , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial extent of the laser beam transverse to the beam direction ( @xmath43 ) is much greater than the wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the wave is effectively a plane wave propagating in the beam direction and the problem is effectively one - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for microwave or radio - frequency ( rf ) cavities where the size of the cavity is similar to the wavelength in all three directions . nevertheless , let us for the moment imagine an unrealistic cavity which has infinite extent in two directions . </S>",

    "<S> maximal sensitivity to the mixing parameter @xmath16 will be achieved if both sines in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> using this we can get a rough idea of what may be accomplished by a similar experiment using microwave or rf cavities ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cavityexp ] ) instead of optical cavities . using @xmath53 , where @xmath40 is the quality factor of the cavity </S>",
    "<S> , we roughly expect @xmath54 to get an idea of the sensitivity which such an experiment can reach let us plug in some numbers . the power output @xmath55 of the detector cavity and the @xmath40 factor via @xmath56 . ] will be @xmath57 in terms of the power @xmath58 put into the emitter cavity . </S>",
    "<S> an input power of @xmath59  w is quite realistic used in the tesla cavities and with a @xmath60  @xcite this corresponds to an energy @xmath61 stored inside the cavity . ]  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and an emission of @xmath62  w is just on the verge of being detectable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high quality cavities based on superconducting technology can reach @xmath60  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> plugging these numbers into eqs .   and </S>",
    "<S> , we infer that , very optimistically , a setup based on microwave or rf cavities might be sensitive to values of the mixing parameter as small as @xmath0 , in the mass range corresponding to the frequency range , i.e. @xmath8 .    motivated by this estimate , let us proceed to more realistic situations , taking into account the appropriate fully three - dimensional geometry . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point are the equations of motion for the photon field @xmath63 and the paraphoton field @xmath64 ( lorentz indices suppressed as the gauge potential . using coulomb gauge @xmath65 , which is compatible with lorentz gauge , we can immediately relate @xmath63 to electric fields via @xmath66 . ] ) following from eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 our strategy is as follows ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cavityexp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the ordinary electromagnetic field inside the first `` emitter '' cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this field acts as a source for the paraphoton field . </S>",
    "<S> the paraphoton field permeates the shielding and in turn acts as a source for an electromagnetic field inside the second `` detector '' cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we will always consider the lowest non - trivial order .    </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order in @xmath16 , we can obtain the electromagnetic field inside the emitter cavity by solving @xmath68 , i.e. the standard equation of ordinary electrodynamics . implementing </S>",
    "<S> the ( time independent ) boundary conditions of the cavity is a textbook exercise  @xcite . using the separation ansatz @xmath69 accounting for a finite quality factor @xmath40 of the cavity , and including a driving force @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> , we have , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an eigenfunction of the spatial part of the wave equation including the appropriate boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to choose a normalization , @xmath73 for example , if the cavity is a cube with side length @xmath74 , the eigenfunctions for the electric field in the @xmath75-directions are @xmath76 where @xmath77 are normalization factors . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues are in this case given by @xmath78    employing an oscillating driving force , @xmath79 the amplitude will eventually approach , @xmath80 for @xmath81 and a driving force that is resonant with the cavity , @xmath82 , the amplitude is enhanced by a factor of @xmath40 with respect to the driving force , @xmath83    the field @xmath84 now acts as a source on the right hand side of the equation of motion for the paraphoton fields , eq . . </S>",
    "<S> the paraphoton does not interact with ordinary matter and no boundary conditions are enforced at finite @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate solution are therefore obtained from the ( retarded ) massive greens function , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the volume of the emitter cavity and @xmath88    in our detector cavity , the field @xmath89 now acts as a source , i.e. a driving force . </S>",
    "<S> the wave equation can again be solved by a separation ansatz analog to eq . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath90 , @xmath91 the driving force @xmath92 can be obtained by remembering that the spatial eigenfunctions of cavities form a complete orthonormal set . inserting the separation ansatz into eq . , multiplying by the eigenfunction @xmath93 and integrating over the volume @xmath94 of the detector cavity , we find @xmath95 to get resonant enhancement we choose @xmath96    the integral in eq </S>",
    "<S> . has dimensions @xmath97 . taking this into account we write @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a dimensionless function that encodes the geometric details of the setup , e.g. relative position , distance and shapes of the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it depends on the mass @xmath100 via @xmath101 , @xmath102 it is typically of order one , as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ formfactor ] , where we show @xmath99 for a setup with two identical cubic cavities .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 200,140 ) ( -7,128)[l][1.3]@xmath103 ( 195,-8)[l][1.3]@xmath104   for a setup with two identical cubic cavities with side length @xmath105 in the @xmath106 mode of eq . . </S>",
    "<S> the cavities are placed parallel and are separated by a distance @xmath107 ( red ) , @xmath108 ( blue ) and @xmath109 ( green ) along the z - axis . as expected @xmath103 scales roughly with @xmath110.,title=\"fig : \" ]    after some time the amplitude in the detector cavity will approach @xmath111    finally , we have to relate the amplitudes to the power input / output in the emitter / detector cavities . </S>",
    "<S> the quality factor is directly related to the power consumption / emission of a cavity , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the energy stored inside the cavity . using this relation , </S>",
    "<S> the probability for a photon to pass through the shielding and to be emitted by the second cavity is @xmath114 if we choose the cavity frequency to be @xmath115 , our expression agrees up to a factor of order unity with our estimate  .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to the @xmath100 dependence of the effect . as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ formfactor ] , the @xmath101 and therefore @xmath100 dependence of @xmath103 is not very strong . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the latter is non - zero for all allowed @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the sensitivity of the proposed experiment to the value of the mixing parameter @xmath16 decreases roughly as @xmath117 when going to smaller masses . </S>",
    "<S> what happens for @xmath36 ? in this case @xmath118 is imaginary and @xmath103 drops exponentially as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the distance between the cavities . since some distance between the cavities is necessary to allow for shielding etc . </S>",
    "<S> , the experiment will not be very sensitive in this region .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ limits ] , we sketch the sensitivity region of two scenarios :    * an optimistic scenario where we basically stick together the best cavities @xmath121 , @xmath30  w , best detectors @xmath122  w , and assume that perfect shielding is possible and * a more modest scenario where we use @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath30  w , and a detectable power of @xmath125  w.    in both cases the achieved sensitivity is better than the current laboratory _ and _ astrophysical limits . the sensitivity region can be further extended by performing several experiments at different frequencies or , even better , scanning through a whole region of frequencies ( thin dashed dotted line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ limits ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> at last we note that one can also obtain a bound from the observed maximal @xmath40 value of the emitter cavity itself . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion of photons into paraphotons leads to an energy loss in the emitter cavity . from our discussion above we can estimate that the probability for a photon to convert to a paraphoton during one pass through the cavity is @xmath126 assuming that conversion into paraphotons is the only source of energy loss we infer that the maximal possible @xmath40 is @xmath127 at the resonance frequency , @xmath115 , an observed value @xmath128 will then translate into a bound of roughly @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> as above , the bound becomes weaker as @xmath130 , for smaller @xmath100 , and drops off sharply for @xmath36 .    finally , let us comment on a few experimental issues . </S>",
    "<S> first , since we use cavities both for production and detection we have to assure that both cavities have the same resonant frequency . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely the frequencies have to agree in a small range @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non - trivial task . </S>",
    "<S> however , compared to optical frequencies ( as proposed in @xcite ) , this should be significantly simpler for microwave of rf cavities : the wavelength is longer and correspondingly the allowed inaccuracies in the cavity are much larger . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the cavities originally developed for the tesla accelerator  @xcite may be mutually tuned in frequencies to a @xmath132  @xcite . with a resonance frequency of roughly 1 ghz </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to an allowed quality factor of the detector cavity of @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used even a somewhat smaller @xmath124 in our modest scenario . </S>",
    "<S> second , one needs to provide sufficiently good shielding between the cavities to prevent exciting the detector cavity by ordinary electromagnetic fields leaking from the production region . </S>",
