    ", growing theoretical effort has been devoted to establish a microscopic description of strongly correlated lattice models out of equilibrium .",
    "yet the numerical simulation of quantum many - body systems in nonequilibrium beyond weak - coupling perturbation theory remains a challenge , in particular for extended systems in dimensions greater than one , where the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite or an exact solution of the schrdinger equation is no longer feasible .    a promising framework to capture both ultrafast dynamics and strong electronic correlation is the nonequilibrium formulation of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , which generalizes dmft  @xcite to the keldysh formalism . in the framework of dmft , a lattice model such as the hubbard model",
    "is mapped onto an effective impurity model , which consists of a single site of the lattice ( impurity ) coupled to a non - interacting medium , where electrons are exchanged between the impurity site and the medium .",
    "one of the key developments for advancing dmft to the nonequilibrium regime is to establish methods to solve the real - time dynamics of this impurity model far from equilibrium .",
    "impurity solvers that have been used so far include real - time continuous - time quantum monte carlo  @xcite , which is numerically exact , but restricted to short times , as well as strong-  @xcite and weak - coupling expansions  @xcite , which have been employed in many studies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) but are restricted to certain parameter regimes . recently , a hamiltonian - based impurity solver scheme has been developed , which further maps the dmft impurity model onto a single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) with a finite number of bath orbitals  @xcite .",
    "the latter is then solved to self - consistency by an exact diagonalization method being equivalent to time - dependent full configuration interaction ( tdci )  @xcite , and one is thus not restricted to either weak or strong on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "the mapping of the dmft impurity model to a siam is similar to the related exact - diagonalization approach to dmft in equilibrium  @xcite , but nevertheless there are important conceptual differences : apart from the description of the initial state , the representation of the dmft bath can be made _ exact _ for small times , while it requires an increasing number of bath orbitals to reach longer times  @xcite ( note that other representation schemes might be useful to obtain qualitatively correct descriptions with few bath orbitals  @xcite or to describe the steady state  @xcite ) .",
    "intuitively , increasing the number of bath orbitals allows the discrete model to develop the finite memory time that is inherent in the original infinite dmft bath , i.e. , the state can explore a larger hilbert space without ever returning close to its initial state .",
    "despite the accuracy of the exact diagonalization method , the exponential scaling of the hilbert space dimension as a function of the number of bath orbitals therefore prohibits us to acquire the dynamics at long time scales .",
    "various approaches in different areas of physics have been developed to overcome this course of dimensionality by finding efficient representations of the wave function . in condensed matter physics , this includes ( time - dependent ) dmrg  @xcite , which is based on a matrix product state representation , and tensor - network representations of many - fermion states  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we introduce the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method , which has originally been developed for the time propagation of nuclear wave packets in molecular quantum dynamics  @xcite , to treat the real - time dynamics of the siam .",
    "the mctdh method provides a route to represent the wave function with a minimal set of time - dependent basis functions that co - move with the evolving state .",
    "this feature can lead to a tremendous reduction of the configuration space .",
    "moreover , the more powerful extension of mctdh , the multi - layer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( ml - mctdh ) method  @xcite , allows for well - adapted tree - tensor network decompositions of the many - body wave function .",
    "while mctdh propagation schemes have recently been used to study transport in the anderson and anderson - holstein model  @xcite , the requirements for a nonequilibrium dmft calculation are often quite demanding : the hamiltonian representation of the dmft impurity model typically implies strongly time - dependent parameters , the regime of interest includes strong coulomb interactions , and , in particular , a fast calculation is required because one needs to perform a large number of simulations to obtain the impurity green s function as a function of two time variables . in order to judge the usefulness of the mctdh method for nonequilibrium dmft it is thus important to provide a comparison of the numerical performance of the method , i.e. , to analyze the ability of the ansatz to compress the siam wave function in the typical parameter regime relevant for dmft and thus to improve on the exponential increase of the numerical effort on the simulation time which we have described above .",

    "an exact solution is more favorable than mctdh , because the latter is implemented in second quantization representation ( mctdh - sqr ) where the state vector is defined in fock space and contains redundant electronic configurations which are unphysical for simulating a system with a given number of electrons ( and spin - orbitals ) . for large systems , as needed to solve the dmft problem at long times , mctdh can become favorable . using the concept of mode combination , we have provided the dynamics of a siam , which describes a typical dmft bath with @xmath175 bath orbitals and is not feasible to be solved by exact diagonalization at reasonable computational cost .",

    "although the efficiency to directly compute the green s function with the standard heidelberg mctdh package for system sizes as large as @xmath231 must still be proven , there are no conceptual difficulties to upscale the scope of the method .    in order to push the applicable regime of the mctdh - based impurity solver to even larger siams and",
