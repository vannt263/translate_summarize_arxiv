    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( sometimes also referred to as doped magnetic semiconductors  we will use the abbreviation `` dms '' to denote both of these equivalent terminologies ) have recently attracted a great deal of attention@xcite for their potential in combining ferromagnetic and semiconductor properties in a single material .",
    "the prototypical dms material is ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as@xcite ( typically @xmath3% ) with the mn ions substitutionally ( in the ideal situation ) replacing ga at the cation sites .",
    "mn ions in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as serve a dual purpose , acting both as dopants ( acceptors in this case ) and as magnetic impurities , whose spins align at the ferromagnetic transition . for @xmath4% , ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as",
    "is found to be ferromagnetic with the ferromagnetic transition temperature ( or , equivalently , the curie temperature ) @xmath5k .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath6 , which corresponds to the highest value of reported value of @xmath7 , is around 5% .",
    "other dms materials of current interest include in@xmath0mn@xmath1as,@xcite ga@xmath0mn@xmath1p,@xcite ge@xmath0mn@xmath1,@xcite and ga@xmath0mn@xmath1sb.@xcite    in spite of a great deal of recent experimental and theoretical activity,@xcite there is not yet a consensus on the fundamental mechanism leading to ferromagnetism in these systems as well as on the definitive predictive theory quantitatively describing this ferromagnetic mechanism .",
    "it is therefore important to work out detailed and experimentally falsifiable consequences for various proposed theoretical models and ideas . in this context , it is unfortunate that much of the theoretical dms literature , perhaps due to the considerable technological motivation in creating room - temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors for projected spintronics applications , has concentrated on the calculations of @xmath7 in various dms materials .",
    "such theoretical predictions of @xmath7 invariably involve tuning free parameters ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , the strength of the exchange coupling between carriers and local moments ) , whose values are often unknown _ a priori_. this significantly reduces the practical importance of these predictions except perhaps in the broadest qualitative sense of identifying the crucial controlling parameters which determine and limit @xmath7 in dms materials . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence @xmath8 of the spontaneous magnetization possesses many characteristics , such as concavity / convexity of the curve , value of saturation magnetization , critical behavior at the point of ferromagnetic transition _ etc .",
    "_ , which can not all be described by just tuning parameters of a given model .",
    "thus study of @xmath8 has a very high potential for elucidating the physics behind dms ferromagnetism in real systems .",
    "a particular issue of considerable significance in dms ferromagnetism has been the non - trivial non - mean - field - like behavior of the spontaneous magnetization as a function of temperature .",
    "this was already apparent in the very first reported observation@xcite of dms ferromagnetism in a iii@xmath0mn@xmath1v material , namely in@xmath0mn@xmath1as , where the experimental @xmath8 curve exhibited an untypical outwardly concave shape strikingly different from the usual convex @xmath8 behavior expected within the textbook weiss mean - field theory@xcite and seen routinely in conventional ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the in@xmath0mn@xmath1as ( with @xmath9 ) system studied in ref .",
    "was an insulating system ( _ i .",
    "e. _  with resistivity increasing monotonically with decreasing temperature ) , and the insulating ferromagnetic dms systems studied so far in the literature almost always exhibit qualitatively similar non - mean - field - like concave @xmath8 behavior.@xcite    two of us have recently shown @xcite that such a manifestly non - mean - field - like concave @xmath8 behavior in insulating dms materials can be understood on the basis of a magnetic percolation transition of bound magnetic polarons in the strongly localized carrier system .",
    "earlier numerical simulations @xcite in the strongly localized regime had already indicated that the @xmath8 behavior of dms ferromagnets could have concave outward shapes as seen experimentally .",
    "very recent numerical simulations @xcite in the strongly localized regime have verified our polaron percolation picture of dms ferromagnetism in the insulating regime .    even in the `` metallic '' ( _ i .",
    "e. _  with resistivity decreasing with @xmath10 below the ferromagnetic transition temperature ) dms systems , @xcite such as optimally doped ga@xmath11mn@xmath12as , where long range magnetic ordering of the mn magnetic moments is created presumably by a dilute gas of delocalized holes mediating the magnetic interaction , the experimentally observed @xmath8 often appears to be very different from the classic mean - field shape.@xcite although the `` metallic '' ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as dms system does not exhibit the manifestly concave temperature dependent magnetization seen in insulating dms systems , the observed @xmath8 in metallic dms is often @xcite almost linear in temperature for @xmath13 , with a temperature - dependent behavior intermediate between the concave @xmath8 shapes of the localized theory@xcite and the textbook convex magnetization curves.@xcite    we mention that very recent annealing experiments @xcite in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as ( with @xmath14 ) demonstrate that @xmath8 behavior ( as well as the value of @xmath7 ) can be strongly affected by annealing , and in particular , `` optimal '' annealing ( to be found empirically for each sample purely by trial and error since the precise role of annealing in improving the materials quality is unknown at this stage ) may lead to reasonably mean - field - like convex @xmath8 shape with a concomitant enhancement of @xmath7 .",
    "`` non - optimal '' annealing , on the other hand , leads to suppression of @xmath7 and strongly non - mean - field - like ( and non - universal ) @xmath8 behavior .",
    "finally , most of dms magnetization measurements in the literature , particularly for the insulating dms systems , show a saturation magnetization ( for @xmath15 ) considerably smaller in magnitude than that expected from the full ordering of all the magnetic ions , indicating that a large fraction ( sometimes as much as 90% ) of the magnetic ions do not contribute to the global dms ferromagnetism .    motivated by the desire for illuminating the physical mechanisms underlying dms ferromagnetism , we theoretically consider in this paper the temperature - dependent magnetization @xmath8 in three - dimensional dms systems using a number of complementary theoretical approaches .",
    "the calculations we present here are based on the static ( weiss ) molecular mean - field theory,@xcite the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite and the percolation theory.@xcite of particular interest is the important issue of correlations between magnetic and transport properties of various dms materials since such correlations should ( and do ) exist in magnetic systems where the ferromagnetism is mediated by carriers leading to the global ordering of the dopant local moments . while earlier studies invariably concentrated on either localized - carrier ( `` insulating '' ) and itinerant - carrier ( `` metallic '' ) material ,",
    "we consider both these regimes as well as the crossover between them . we provide detailed numerical results for our calculated magnetization @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the applied external magnetic field and @xmath10 the temperature , in various regimes of the system parameter space .",
    "these @xmath16 results should help ascertain the applicability of various theoretical models to specific experimental dms materials of current interest .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we describe our model and our theoretical approaches based on the weiss mean - field theory , dmft , and the percolation theory , and present our numerical results for @xmath16 in each of the theoretical approaches providing brief discussion of our results in light of the existing experimental data in the literature .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] summarizing our qualitative findings and providing a critical perspective on what our theoretical results on magnetization imply for the microscopic mechanisms underlying dms ferromagnetism with the particular emphasis on the correlations between transport characteristics ( `` metallic '' or `` insulating '' ) and @xmath8 behavior ( convex , concave , or `` linear '' ) .",
    "we assume in this work that the fundamental mechanism underlying ferromagnetism in dms materials ( _ e .",
    "g. _ iii@xmath0mn@xmath1v , ge@xmath0mn@xmath1 ) is the carrier  local - moment ( kinetic or @xmath18-@xmath19 ) exchange coupling , which eventually leads to a global ferromagnetic ordering of the impurity local moments ( _ i .",
    "e. _ mn ) for @xmath20 overcoming any direct antiferromagnetic ( super - exchange ) interaction between the local moment spins themselves .",
    "this is certainly the prevalent viewpoint for dms ferromagnetism , at least for ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as system following the pioneering work of ohno and his collaborators .",
    "it is natural to ask about the evidence for this belief in carrier - mediated dms ferromagnetism induced in the mn local moments .",
    "first - principles band theory calculations indicate that there is strong @xmath18-@xmath19 hybridization between the mn @xmath19-levels and the valence band @xmath18-states of gaas .",
    "this leads to strong kinetic exchange coupling between hole spins and mn spins , which is the basis of our model .",
    "experimentally , there are a number of compelling circumstantial indications of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as being a carrier - mediated ferromagnetic material .",
    "first , there is the strong correlation ( made even stronger by the recent annealing experiments ) between transport and magnetic properties .",
    "this , however , is not definitively conclusive since strongly insulating ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as ( and in@xmath0mn@xmath1as ) samples are also found to be ferromagnetic ( albeit with much lower @xmath7 values ) . perhaps the most compelling evidence supporting the carrier - mediated ferromagnetic mechanism is the observed agreement ( so far available only in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as dms systems ) between the magnetization measured directly using a squid magnetometer and that inferred by analyzing the anomalous hall effect data .",
    "such an consistency between direct and `` transport - inferred '' magnetization strongly suggests a carrier - mediated exchange mechanism underlying dms ferromagnetism .",
    "in addition , there are a number of experiments dealing with optical properties ( again , available only for ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as so far ) which indicate very strong correlation between the magnetic band structure and the magnetization of the system , leading again to the condition that the global ferromagnetic ordering of the mn local moments is most likely induced by the hole spin polarization in dms systems . the related issue of whether these carriers are valence band holes or impurity band holes is more difficult to settle . given the strong inherent disorder in dms materials and rather strong exchange coupling between hole and mn spins ( leading to local binding of holes and mn ions ) , it is natural to think that all of the physics ( both localized and delocalized ) are essentially impurity band physics .",
    "this viewpoint , which we have adopted in our theories presented in this paper , has received strong support from recent optical experiments .",
    "also our dmft results , as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2b ] , clearly demonstrate the important role of impurity band physics in dms magnetic properties .",
    "since the most intensively studied dms materials of current interest are mn - doped iii - v semiconductors iii@xmath0mn@xmath1v ( _ e .",
    "ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as , in@xmath0mn@xmath1as , ga@xmath0mn@xmath1p , ga@xmath0mn@xmath1n , ga@xmath0mn@xmath1sb ) , where the carriers are typically holes , we will other refer to the semiconductor carriers as `` holes '' in the rest of the article without any loss of generality .",
    "so our basic model is that of a finite density @xmath21 of magnetic dopants ( `` impurities '' ) interacting through a local exchange coupling with a finite density @xmath22 of holes in the host semiconductor material with @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that magnetic impurities under consideration enter substitutionally at the cation sites ( _ e .",
    "g. _ mn impurities at ga sites ) .",
    "recent experimental annealing studies of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as have shown @xcite that lattice defects may be playing an important role in determining magnetic and transport properties of the samples , but we assume in our work that these defects enter our theory only in determining the basic parameters of the model , namely , the density of magnetically active dopants @xmath21 , the hole density @xmath22 , and perhaps the local effective exchange coupling @xmath24 between the holes and the magnetic impurities , and do not include any defects into our model explicitly .",
    "examples of such defects which enter our model through its parameters rather than directly are given by antisite defects in the host semiconductor material ( _ i .",
    "e. _ as at ga sites in gaas ) and mn interstitials ( _ i .",
    "e. _  mn atoms at interstitials sites rather than cation substitutional sites ) , which may very well be important in providing substantial compensation in the semiconductor , leading to the experimental fact that the hole density @xmath22 is usually a small fraction of the magnetic dopant density instead of there being a one - to - one correspondence between dopants and holes .",
    "the local moment density @xmath21 in our model is not necessarily the total mn concentration in the system , since the presence of mn interstitial defects could lower the density of magnetically active mn ions . in this work",
    "we use @xmath21 to denote local moment volume density and @xmath6 to denote the fraction of ga atoms replaced by mn dopants .",
    "similarly , consistent with the spirit of our minimal model we also neglect all band structure effects in our theory , making the simplest approximation such as a single parabolic band with a single effective mass or a single simple tight - binding carrier band characterized by an effective band width parameter .",
    "this is not because realistic band structure effects are not of any importance in dms ferromagnetism , in fact we believe that spin - orbit coupling in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as valence band hole states may play a quantitative role in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as ferromagnetism , particularly in the relatively disorder - free `` metallic '' ( @xmath25 ) systems where the holes are likely to be gaas valence band hole states with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our reasons for neglecting spin - orbit coupling and other band structure effects in our theory are the following : ( 1 ) our interest in this paper is in theoretically exploring @xmath16 within a minimal model , which requires only @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 , leaving out all non - essential complications ; ( 2 ) if needed , band structure effects can be systematically included in the future by appropriately extending the model ; ( 3 ) due to the inevitable presence of strong exchange coupling and strong disorder in dms materials , a starting point based on perfect `` realistic '' valence band hole states may be inapplicable  in fact , we believe that much of the dms physics is occurring in the impurity band of the host semiconductor with the itinerant and the localized carriers being the extended and the localized hole states in the impurity band of the system and not the valence band states , a view point strongly supported by several recent experimental results.@xcite    the hamiltonian of exchange interaction between magnetic impurities and holes we use in this paper reads @xmath26 where @xmath24 , which has units of energy , is the exchange coupling between an impurity spins @xmath27 located at @xmath28 and a hole spin density @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the unit cell volume needed for proper normalization .",
    "the impurity spin * s * in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is assumed to be completely classical in the theory whereas the carrier spin * s * is treated quantum - mechanically .",
    "this is justified because the impurity spin is large , _",

    "@xmath31 for mn in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as .    our model ( except for the mean - field theory considerations of sec .",
    "[ sec:2a ] ) omits the direct mn@xmath32mn antiferromagnetic exchange interaction assuming its effects to be either negligibly small or incorporated into the effective parameters of the model .",
    "actually , in the parameter range of interest to us ( @xmath33 ) , where dms ferromagnetism typically occurs , the magnetic impurities are separated from each other by non - magnetic atoms , and this antiferromagnetic interaction , which rapidly decays with the distance , should be negligible .",
    "we also ignore any specific hole - hole interaction effect in our theory .",
    "these approximations are nonessential and are done in the spirit of identifying the minimal dms magnetic model of interest .",
    "both of these effects , which may be of quantitative importance in some situations , can be included in the theory by adjusting the parameters of the model or perhaps at the cost of introducing more unknown parameters characterizing these interactions .",

    ".    the local exchange coupling can be ferromagnetic ( @xmath46 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath47 ) without affecting dms ferromagnetism [ first principles band theory @xcite suggests local antiferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath47 ) for the holes in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as ] .",
    "finally , we mention that the magnetic interaction hamiltonian defined by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is sometimes referred to as the _ s - d _ ( or _ s - f _ ) exchange hamiltonian @xcite or the zener model @xcite in the literature although it was originally introduced @xcite by nabarro and frhlich in a slightly different context .",

    "we mention that we choose @xmath31 and @xmath48 in all our numerical calculations below .",
    "unfortunately none of the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 of our model is directly experimentally measurable .",
    "this is why we have emphasized throughout this work qualitative behavior in temperature - dependent magnetization as a function of the system parameters .",
    "the carrier density @xmath22 is hard to measure even in metallic ferromagnetic materials because of the problems associated with anomalous hall effect ( and the situation is obviously worse in strongly insulting systems ) .",
    "the local moment density @xmath21 is unknown because only a fraction of the incorporated mn atoms are magnetically active due to the invariable presence of mn interstitials and other possible defects in the system .",
    "what is known about ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as is that it is a heavily compensated system in the sense that the density of holes , is much less than the density of mn , typically @xmath49 .",
    "much of this compensation most likely arises from various defects invariably present in low - temperature mbe grown ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as .",
    "the two most `` harmful '' defects in this respect are mn interstitials and as antisites . both of these defects act as effective double donors , producing two electrons each .",
    "thus the holes produced by the magnetically and electrically active `` desirable '' mn@xmath50 ions ( sitting at substitutional cation sites ) , with each substitutional mn ion producing one hole , could be heavily compensated by the defects leading to the existing situation in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as where @xmath51 .",
    "all aspects of kondo physics are completely negligible for the current problem .",
    "kondo physics is relevant only in the complementary regime of high carrier density ( @xmath52 ) , where a paramagnetic carrier ground state entails as the impurity spin is quenched by the free carriers . for itinerant delocalized carriers ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , metallic dms ) , the indirect exchange coupling between the local moments ( induced by carrier spin polarization ) is precisely the rkky interaction . the relevance ( or perhaps even , the dominance ) of rkky physics ( leading to a magnetic ground state ) over the kondo physics in the low carrier density limit of the kondo lattice system has occasionally been mentioned in the kondo - effect literature.@xcite    the crucial element of rkky physics playing a key role in dms ferromagnetism is the relatively low values of carrier density in these materials leading to @xmath53{n_{\\textrm{i } } } \\ll 1 $ ] ( where @xmath54 is the fermi wavevector associated with the carrier density @xmath22 and @xmath55{n_{\\textrm{i}}}$ ] is the characteristic inter - impurity separation ) so that the rkky interaction is essentially always ferromagnetic , and the rkky spin - glass type behavior predominant in disordered magnetic metallic systems may not arise here since the interaction is mostly ferromagnetic avoiding effects of frustration .",
    "in principle one could start from the general hamiltonian ( [ ham_full ] ) , and try to develop a theory for carrier localization and magnetism on an equal footing . such an ambitious attempt would be essentially futile , due to the enormous complexity of the problem , which would require both disorder and exchange interaction to be treated non - perturbatively .",
    "we therefore adopt the reasonable empirical approach of building into our basic model the metallic ( itinerant carriers ) or the insulating ( localized carriers ) nature of the system , and develop separate complementary theoretical approaches for the two situations in order to compare and contrast the nature of dms ferromagnetism in metallic and insulating systems , both with the local exchange magnetic hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) coupling the impurity moments to carrier spins .",
    "we use complementary theoretical approaches ( degenerate- and non - degenerate - carrier weiss static mean - field theory , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , and percolation theory ) in this paper ; two of which apply to the limiting cases of extended `` metallic '' system ( degenerate - carrier mean - field theory and dmft ) and the other two to the strongly localized `` insulating '' system ( non - degenerate - carrier mean - field theory and percolation theory ) . in principle , dmft can interpolate smoothly between the systems with extended and localized carriers , but we have neglected localization effects in our dmft calculations carried out so far . our results for temperature- and magnetic - field - dependent magnetization @xmath16 exhibit qualitative behavior very similar to that seen in experiments which , given the minimal nature of our theoretical model , is all we can expect of the theory . in our view , at this early stage of the development of dms materials and their physical understanding ( and given the metastable and fragile complex nature of the dms systems ) , where all the materials details ( _ e .",
    "g. _  defects and disorder of many possible types ) qualitatively affecting the system magnetization may not even be known at the present time , it is premature to demand ( or impose , for example , by tuning the parameters of the theoretical model ) quantitative agreement between theory and experiment . in this respect",
    "we strongly disagree with the statements asserting that dms ferromagnetism is a well - understood problem based on a model of free valence band holes interacting with mn local moments .",
    "the excellent qualitative agreement between our calculated magnetization results in different theoretical approaches and the experimental magnetization data in the existing literature provides useful insight into the possible magnetic mechanisms underlying `` metallic '' and `` insulating '' dms systems .",
    "the basic idea underlying the static mean - field theory , as applied to ferromagnetism in dms , is to represent action of all impurity / hole spins upon a given impurity / hole spin as an effective `` mean field , '' whose value is determined by the average values of the spins acting upon this given spin .",
    "the resulting equations for the spins of impurities and holes are to be solved self - consistently , finally yielding the equilibrium magnetization at a given temperature .",
    "the difference between the mean - field theory considered in this section and the canonical weiss mean - field model arises from the existence of two interacting species of spins , those of holes and of impurities in a dms system . as a result",
    ", we have two effective fields ",
    "one determined by the average value of a hole spin and the other determined by the average value of an impurity spin . in the framework of hamiltonian  ( [ ham_full ] ) , the effective field acting upon holes has contributions coming from magnetic impurities and from the external magnetic field @xmath56 , @xmath57 where the direction of the @xmath58 axis is chosen to coincide with the direction of applied magnetic field @xmath45 , or , in the case of @xmath15 , with the direction of spontaneous magnetization of impurities .",
    "the effective field acting upon impurities is a sum of contributions from holes and the external magnetic field .",
    "relative simplicity of the static mean - field theory allows us to account also for possible direct antiferromagnetic interaction between magnetic impurities by adding the following term to the hamiltonian @xmath59 which yields one more contribution to the effective field acting upon magnetic impurities : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the effective number of surrounding impurities a given impurity interacts with .",

    "the temperature - dependent magnetization results presented in this work for different but interrelated theoretical models are qualitatively consistent with one another .",

[ sec:2a2 ] ) and the dynamical mean - field theory ( see sec .  [ sec:2b ] ) , both give onwardly convex @xmath8 carriers , similar ( but not identical ) to that in the textbook molecular mean - field result , with the convexity being enhanced ( suppressed ) with increasing ( decreasing ) delocalized carrier density . in typical situations involving itinerant carriers in metallic dms systems ,",
    "we find temperature dependent magnetization curves which are almost linear at lower temperatures in excellent agreement with experimental observations in metallic gamnas systems .",
    "such apparent `` non - mean - field - like '' magnetization behavior , found here both in our delocalized - carrier static and dynamic mean - field theories , arises from a combination of reasons : ( 1 ) the double brillouin function [ _ i .",
    "e. _ @xmath244 form of the coupled field magnetization [ see eq .",
    "( [ sieq ] ) ] ; ( 2 ) the low values of @xmath77 , leading to the mn moments feeling on the average a much reduced number of free carriers .",
    "as the carrier density is increased , for example by suitable annealing in recent experimental studies , such linear magnetization curves evolve toward the more conventional outwardly convex magnetization , as can be seen in our results and in recent annealing experiments.@xcite in the case of localized carriers appropriate for insulating dms systems ( many of which are also found to be ferromagnetic with well - defined curie temperatures , _",
    "ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as for @xmath245 , in@xmath0mn@xmath1as,@xcite and ge@xmath0mn@xmath1@xcite ) , our two complementary theories , namely the non - degenerate - carrier static mean - field theory ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2a1 ] ) and the percolation theory ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2c ] ) , give qualitatively similar magnetization behavior . in particular , at low carrier densities the @xmath8 curves in strongly insulating dms systems exhibit strikingly `` non - mean - field - like '' outwardly concave magnetization behavior , as often observed in insulating dms systems .",
    "again , this unusual concave magnetization behavior arises from a combination of the strongly localized nature of the carrier system and the low values of the carrier density ( _ i .",
    "e. _ @xmath51 ) in dms materials .",
    "we emphasize , however , a very important feature of theoretical results presented in this work : the convex magnetization behavior in the strongly metallic case and the concave behavior in the insulating case are _ not _ a sharp dichotomy in dms properties  these are really the two extremes of a continuum of possible magnetization behavior in dms materials , as can be inferred from the results of sec .",
    ". the typical dms magnetization behavior should lie somewhere in between these two extremes of highly concave ( low carrier density and strongly localized insulating dms ) and highly convex ( high carrier density and strongly delocalized metallic dms ) magnetization , leading to the generic experimental observation of almost linear @xmath8 behavior in ferromagnetic ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as .",
    "another often - mentioned peculiar aspect of dms magnetization , namely the low value of the saturation magnetization ( compared with the number of mn ions in the sample as given by the value of @xmath6 in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as ) , is also apparent in our theoretical results presented in this work . in particular",
    ", the presence of direct antiferromagnetic coupling between the mn moments may drastically suppress the saturation magnetization , as can be seen in the results presented in figs .",
    "[ mft_fig2 ] and [ mft_fig5 ] of this paper .",
    "this absence of complete magnetization saturation in our mean - filed results is akin to having effective ferrimagnetism in the system .",
    "in addition , the calculated magnetization is may be much lower than the saturation value except at very low temperatures , see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0_vs_t ] , which could also explain the lack of magnetization saturation .",
    "it is likely that in the real dms materials an appreciable fraction of the mn moments are magnetically inactive because they do not sit in cation substitutional sites , but rather at defect sites such as interstitials and are antiferromagnetically coupled to other mn moments .",
    "such magnetically inactive mn atoms could be one of the reasons for the low values of saturation magnetization in ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as .",
    "we also note that our percolation theory provides another possible explanation for the observed low values of saturation magnetization in low carrier density insulating dms materials .",
    "since the infinite cluster of percolating bound magnetic polarons triggering the long - range ferromagnetic ordering necessarily leaves out a large number of mn moments ( which are not parts of the infinite cluster except at @xmath246 ) , one naturally expects a very low saturation magnetization except perhaps at @xmath247 .",
    "a recent series of potentially important annealing experiments in metallic ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as samples by several different groups may eventually shed considerable light on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dms ferromagnetism .",
    "these experiments , while differing somewhat on the details , all find that suitable low temperature `` optimal '' annealing may enhance the magnetic properties of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as by increasing @xmath7 and more importantly for our purpose , by enhancing @xmath8 to more convex almost standard mean - field - like behavior .",
    "this enhancement of magnetization seems to correlate well with improvement in the metallicity of the annealed sample ( _ e .",
    "g. _ higher conductivity ) and with an increase in the hole density .",
    "annealing may also be enhancing the magnetic properties by annealing away some of the mn interstitials .",
    "our theoretical results are in excellent agreement with these annealing experiments , since increasing @xmath77 does lead to enhanced ( and more convex ) magnetization in our theory . in this context",
    ", it will be very helpful to have more detailed information on the @xmath8 behavior in strongly localized insulating samples both for ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as with @xmath245 and for other insulating dms materials ( _ e .",
    "g. _ ge@xmath0mn@xmath1 ) .",
    "our final comment addresses the role of disorder ( essentially neglected in our work , except for the percolation theory part , as we treat it in the virtual crystal approximation , _",
    "i.  e. _ , we assume that holes and local moments only feel the average effective field ) , which is invariably strong ( and not yet well understood ) in dms materials .",
    "in particular , even the `` metallic '' dms systems are in effect very poor metals with mean - free paths which are at or below the ioffe - regel limit ( with low - temperature mobilities of the order of a few @xmath248/v@xmath249s only ) , indicating the presence of very strong disorder.@xcite in the presence of such strong disorder , various spin glass ground states may compete with ferromagnetic ground states .",
    "we believe that it is important to look for signatures of spin glass physics in low - temperature dms magnetic properties .",
    "it may very well turn out that spin glass phases dominate the regime of parameter space ( _ e .",
