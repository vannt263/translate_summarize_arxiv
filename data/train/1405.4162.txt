    "with the advances in nanotechnology enabling a controlled miniaturization and a functionalization of nanostructured materials , questions related to the thermodynamical properties are gaining an increased attention .",
    "several theoretical proposals were put forward for nanoscale brownian motors @xcite , refrigerators @xcite and quantum heat engines @xcite . on the other hand , for finite systems , the application of the laws of thermodynamics is the subject of an ongoing debate @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental questions concerns the size limit to which the working substance might be scaled down .",
    "recent studies point out that the quantum nature of a size - quantized working substance , e.g. a quantum heat engine , may lead to a close connection between the efficiency of the cycle and quantum correlations @xcite , which can be quantified in terms of the entanglement @xcite , a behavior that is atypical for classical engines . according to the fundamental laws of thermodynamics ,",
    "the efficiency of a classical engine is independent of its detail and is solely determined by the character of the cycle itself and the temperatures of the heat baths . the quantum nature of the working substance , however , has key consequences for the engine output power as well .",
    "recently it was shown that purely quantum phenomena , such as noise - induced coherence , yields greater engine output power @xcite .",
    "+ in general , physical phenomena at the crossover of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics are the subjects of the emergent field of quantum thermodynamics where , among other topics , questions are addressed as to what extent standard classical thermodynamic cycles , such as carnot or otto cycles , can be reformulated for quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a key issue thereby is the difference between thermodynamic and quantum adiabatic processes .",
    "for example , a thermodynamical adiabatic process does not necessarily mean that the occupation probabilities are invariant during an adiabatic transition .",
    "as usual , thermodynamical adiabatic processes are identified in terms of the conservation of the entropy and the isolation of the system from the heat exchange with the thermal bath . an essential requirement for the quantum adiabatic process is that the population distributions remain unchanged .",
    "thus , quantum adiabaticity is a stricter requirement than the thermodynamic one .",
    "the adiabatic quantum process is also adiabatic in the thermodynamic sense , the opposite is however not true in general .",
    "therefore , quantum adiabaticity entails a relatively low power output from a slowly operating quantum engine , unless the energy spectrum of the working substance has nodal crossing points , however , this is not a generic feature of realistic physical systems .",
    "landau zener transitions are avoided during an adiabatic segment of the cycle by slowly varying the control parameters @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "the subtlety of quantum engines is related to the internal connection between essentially quantum phenomena such as entanglement and the thermodynamic characteristics of the cycle . in this regard , the choice of the working substance for the operating quantum engine is an important issue @xcite .",
    "+ recently , there has been a great interest in composite multiferroic ( mf ) materials that possess coupled ferromagnetic ( fm ) and ferroelectric ( fe ) properties @xcite ( for a review we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "these materials allow for a multitude of novel applications based on the control of magnetism ( ferroelectricity ) with electric ( magnetic ) fields .",
    "they offer new opportunities for the design and control of new circuits for quantum information processing . for an interesting class of magnetoelectrics ,",
    "the me coupling is rooted in a chiral magnetic ordering that is coupled to an electric polarization @xmath1 such that@xcite @xmath2 above @xmath3 , is the relative spatial vector between the effective spins @xmath4 and @xmath5 localized at neighboring sites . though eq.([eq.1 ] ) was derived initially phenomenologically , a fully microscopic theory based on the electronic states was developed shortly thereafter @xcite . the emergence of an electric polarization , when coupling the spatial degrees of freedom to the spin chirality , renders possible an efficient manipulation and control of the spin order parameter via an applied external electric field .    in the present project",
    ", we will study a model for a quantum otto engine operating on the basis of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) finite size mf chiral spin chain that acts as a working substance .",
    "the possibility of controlling the efficiency of the quantum heat engine via an external electric field motivates our choice of the working substance . for small working substance consisting of four spins with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "we provide an analytical solution to the problem . for a larger size of the working substance",
    "an exact numerical diagonalization reveals the connection between the thermal entanglement and the cycle efficiency .",
    "our theoretical model is experimentally feasible .",
    "recently discovered materials such as the quantum @xmath6 spin chain magnets @xmath7 , possess simultaneously ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties .",
    "@xmath8 patterns of the chain magnets can be manufactured using @xmath9 powders and a @xmath10 stove @xcite .",
    "then , a spin chain magnet doped on the @xmath11 or nonmagnetic @xmath12 substrate could serve as a working substance , while a @xmath10 stove could be implemented as a thermal bath for controlling the temperature of the working substance .",
    "the cycle we are going to study consists of two thermodynamic adiabatic and two isochoric strokes . during the two isochoric strokes , the multiferroic spin chain interacts with the heat baths . during the two thermodynamic adiabatic strokes the amplitude of the electric field is changed ( cf .",
    "fig.[system ] for a schematic illustration ) .",
    "since the energy levels of the system depend on the electric field , a change in the electric field modifies the energy levels . in this way",
    "work is done by the engine during the thermodynamic adiabatic strokes . in what follows",
    ", we will study the connection between the cycle efficiency , the entanglement and the electric field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our model . in section",
    "iii we present analytical results obtained for the multiferroic chain working substance consisting of four spins . in particular we study : the dependence of the pair and the nonlocal many - body entanglements on the temperature and the amplitude of the electric field and the temperature dependence of the quantum chirality and the electric and magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "each of these quantities has a particular meaning : quantum chirality is a measure for the spin frustration and allows to drive the cycle and to control the cycle efficiency by an external electric field .",
    "the electric and magnetic susceptibilities can be used to detect the thermal phase transitions in the working substance , and the local and many - body entanglements are useful to observe the connection between the cycle efficiency and the quantum correlations . in section iv we discuss details of the thermodynamic cycle and in section v we evaluate the scaling of the cycle efficiency with the size of the working substance . in section vi we study the quantum otto cycle in the semiclassical limit and wrap up in section vii .",

    "what follows , we suppose that @xmath38 and go over to dimensionless units such that @xmath39 , i.e. , we measure the zeeman energy and the interaction energy with electric field in units of the exchange constant . as was mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the purpose of the present project is to investigate a possible control of the cycle efficiency and thermal entanglement via an external electric driving field . for clarity",
    "we combine analytical and full numerical approaches and start with a solvable model consisting of a four spins with periodic boundary conditions as a working substance .",
    "following standard definitions @xcite we calculate the pair concurrence between two arbitrary spins of the working substance @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the reduced density matrix of the system of two spins obtained from the density matrix of the system @xmath40 ( [ eq.3 ] ) after tracing out two remaining spins @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "after some rather straightforward calculations we obtain    @xmath53    similarly we calculate for the other components    @xmath54    @xmath55    in view of eqs .",

    "this indicates that a major amount of the entanglement of the mf working substance is stored in the long - range , multi - spin correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the one tangle , the pair correlation is sensitive to the increase in the temperature .",
    "in particular , we observe the existence of a threshold temperature for the two tangle @xmath78",
    ". the stronger the electric field amplitude , the higher is the threshold temperature , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] . the same behavior we encounter for the chirality , as well ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] ) .",
    "in particular , with increasing the temperature the thermal chirality undergoes strong changes and for the threshold temperature @xmath165 of the two tangle @xmath78 , the thermal chirality reaches its minima .",
    "thus , the thermal chirality is related rather to the pair correlations in the system , not to the nonlocal entanglement .",
    "we also studied the relations of the magnetic and the electric susceptibilities to the temperature . according to the definition eq.([eq.11 ] ) , the maximum of the susceptibilities corresponds to a minimum of the fidelity . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] - fig .",
    "[ fig.9n ] with fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , we conclude on a direct correlation between the threshold temperature of the pair entanglement @xmath78 and the minimum of the fidelities . the maximum of the electric and the magnetic susceptibilities are related to the corresponding threshold temperatures of the pair correlations .",
    "the maximum of the electric susceptibility is observed almost at the threshold temperatures @xmath110 of the pair entanglement @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , the quantum engine with a mf working substance is much more sensitive to the electric field than to the magnetic field which we think is favorable from an experimental point of view .",
