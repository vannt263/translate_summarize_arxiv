    "in 1975 peter szekeres @xcite discovered a very interesting family of exact inhomogeneous solutions of the einstein field equations , for which the matter source is a comoving , zero pressure fluid ( dust ) .",
    "there are 6 arbitrary functions that depend on the  radial \" coordinate .",
    "although one of these functions can be used to remove the re - scaling freedom in the  radial \" coordinate , there is no canonical choice that does not restrict the physical possibilities @xcite .",
    "there are actually two classes of szekeres model , the more commonly used one is a generalisation of the lematre - tolman  @xcite and ellis @xcite metrics , and the other is a generalisation of the datt - kantowski - sachs @xcite metrics . since the latter can be viewed as a limit of the former @xcite , we focus on the lematre - tolman - ellis - like metric .",
    "three of the szekeres arbitrary functions are identical to those of the  underlying \" lematre - tolmanor ellis metric , and the other three control the deviation from spherical , planar , or hyperboloidal ( pseudo - spherical ) symmetry .",
    "a key result for this metric was the proof by bonnor , suleiman and tomimura ( bst ) that it has no killing vectors @xcite .",
    "this is despite the constant time 3-surfaces being conformally flat @xcite , and the lack of gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "in fact the bst paper only considered the quasi - spherical case , though one would expect it to generalise ; a task which we complete here along the way .",
    "nolan and debnath @xcite , in investigating shell focussing singularities , have shown that if a quasi - spherical szekeres spacetime has a  radial \" null geodesic , then the spacetime is axially symmetric and the ray lies along the axis ; if there is more than one radial null geodesic , it is spherically symmetric .",
    "further , they showed that all axi - symmetric szekeres models are equivalent .",
    "krasinski & bolejko @xcite considered light paths and redshifts in szekeres models . in general , light rays emitted from the same matter point at different times , and received by the same observer , do not follow the same comoving spatial path .",
    "the authors asked under what conditions the spatial paths of two such light rays might be repeated .",
    "they showed that if all light paths between every emitter - observer pair are repeated the spacetime must be a ( dust ) flrw model , and if there exists a repeated ray along a single direction then the model is axi - symmetric about that direction .",
    "they also generalised the nolan and debnath result to quasi - hyperbolic and quasi - planar models . for the lematre - tolman  and ellis models , only the  radial \" rays have repeatable paths .",
    "neither of the above papers claimed they had found all the axi - symmetric szekeres models , and the possibility , in the quasi - hyperbolic and quasi - planar models , of other , non - rotational single symmetries was not considered .",
    "sussman & gaspar @xcite studied the location of extrema of density , expansion and spatial curvature , and they produced some very nice numerical examples and plots of szekeres models with complex structure .",
    "they also mentioned cases where one or two of the non - spherical arbitrary functions are constant , and suggest some are axially symmetric .",
    "more complex szekeres matter distributions  networks of matter structure  were investigated by sussman , gaspar & hidalgo @xcite .    though there is a significant body of work on the szekeres models , @xcite , and",
    "there has been a renewal of interest recently , the lack of killing vectors makes this metric relatively hard to work with .",
    "the quasi - planar and quasi - hyperboloidal cases have been especially neglected .",
    "therefore the symmetric special cases with a single killing vector would be useful as stepping stones between full spherical , planar or hyperboloidal symmetry and the general szekeres case .",
    "a fuller description of the szekeres metric and its properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "the line element is @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and we write @xmath9 the evolution function @xmath10 obeys a friedmann equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and solving this de introduces the bang - time function @xmath13 .",
    "the matter is comoving , @xmath14 , and has a dust equation of state ( @xmath15 ) , the density being given by @xmath16 each 2-surface of constant @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a unit 2-sphere if @xmath2 , a unit 2-pseudo - sphere ( or hyperboloid ) if @xmath0 , and a 2-plane if @xmath1 .",
    "the shape function @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are stereographic coordinates on each 2-surface .",
    "the transformation between stereographic coordinates @xmath25 and the more regular  polar \" type coordinates can be found in @xcite for each of the three @xmath3 values .",
    "@xmath26 gives the evolving scale area of the constant @xmath27 shell , since its square multiplies the unit - scale surface , ( [ ds2unit ] ) .",

    "the dipole is due to the factor @xmath45 ; on each @xmath24 2-sphere , it is zero on an  equator \" , maximum at one  pole \" , and minimum at the opposite  pole \" , with @xmath46 .",
    "the strength and orientation of the dipole depend on coordinate radius @xmath27 through ( [ erees])-([qe ] ) .",
    "the quasi - hyperboloidal szekeres metric , with @xmath0 , has been much less studied .",

    "only one of the two sheets can be free of shell crossings and only if @xmath48 in this latter case too there is a kind of hyperboloidal ( or pseudo - spherical ) dipole with strength ( [ erees ] ) and orientation defined by ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ qe ] ) .",
    "if ( [ qhszcondit ] ) is not satisfied , ( [ erees ] ) is not real , and extrema with respect to @xmath49 & @xmath50 do not exist .",
    "the quasi - planar szekeres metric , given by @xmath1 , does not have an extremum of @xmath45 , so one can not talk about a  dipole \" .",
    "it should be noted that a single spacetime can have both @xmath2 and @xmath0 regions , joined by an @xmath1 region which may be thin ( a 3-surface ) or may have finite width .",
    "[ szsingsymm ]    the szekeres metric  in its fully general form  has no killing vectors @xcite .",
    "however , it contains the spherically - symmetric special case , the lematre - tolman  model @xcite .",
    "for example , if we choose the functions @xmath36 , @xmath51 & @xmath52 to be constant @xmath53 we will find a lematre - tolman  model .",
    "therefore we expect that axially symmetric special cases exist ; and indeed examples such as @xmath2 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are known .    the spherical symmetry of lt models results from the fact that every const .",

    "the same references also showed the 3 cases for each @xmath227 are equivalent since they can be transformed into each other .",
    "there is a theorem that in any spacetime with a symmetry , the locus of fixed points is a totally geodesic submanifold .",
    "in particular , with axial symmetry , the locus of fixed points , that is the axis , must be  straight \" , i.e. geodesic in the constant @xmath30 3-spaces . for szekeres models we found that the dipole extrema also lie on this locus .",
    "in section [ extrmgd ] , we asked a slightly different question , and showed that if the locus of dipole extrema is required to be geodesic , then we get the same family of symmetric szekeres models .    in section [ szequiv ]",
    "we have presented the full set of equivalences between general szekeres models .",
    "if two szekeres metrics have the same @xmath78 , @xmath69 and @xmath228 , and their @xmath36 , @xmath51 & @xmath52 are related by one of these equivalences , or a combination of them , then they are physically equivalent , and can be transformed into each other .",
    "the list in @xcite was not quite complete .",
    "[ bstkv ]    we here review the salient part of @xcite and comment on generalising to @xmath229 . assuming a non - vanishing killing vector field of the form ( [ kvform ] )",

    "thus , by ( [ alpha2alpha3 ] ) , ( [ ke12 ] ) and ( [ ke13 ] ) we have @xmath240 we next take the @xmath27 derivative of ( [ ke22 ] ) , apply ( [ deltaconst ] ) & ( [ btgmindepr ] ) , @xmath241 and substitute for @xmath242 from ( [ ke11 ] ) @xmath243 to get @xmath244 noting that @xmath245 this reduces to @xmath246 again we do nt allow @xmath247 to vanish , in order to avoid singularities , and therefore @xmath248 after a derivation with respect to @xmath30 and multiplying with @xmath249 , we can use the friedman equation ( [ rtsqeq ] ) and its @xmath30 and @xmath27 derivatives to eliminate @xmath250 .",
    "in addition we use equation ( [ aldteq ] ) to eliminate @xmath251 .",

    "however the result follows for all @xmath3 , if we alter the assumption regarding @xmath256 slightly . for @xmath227 we must have @xmath257 and",
    "thus also @xmath258 .",
    "clearly this is not an interesting model we have a vacuum model , which forces spherical symmetry to avoid shell crossings @xcite . ] , and by assumption ( [ fnotm32 ] ) , we exclude this choice of special lt - functions .    for @xmath58",
    "we only have @xmath259 which we again exclude by ( [ fnotm32]).const .",
    "allows for a constant @xmath30-component @xmath251 and an @xmath27-component @xmath260 of the killing vector . ]",
    "therefore we must have @xmath261 , and from equation ( [ aldteq ] ) it follows that @xmath262 .",
    "the killing vector now has the form ( [ btgmpq ] ) , which is used in section [ kleqs ]",
    ".    bst go on to show that either there must be a linear relation between the three functions @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , or the killing vector must vanish everywhere .",
    "this means a necessary condition for a non - vanishing killing vector field is @xmath266 where @xmath267 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 are constants , not all zero .",
    "this condition emerged in ( [ pqsint ] ) and ( [ case3cond ] ) .",
    "_ remark : _   strictly speaking , bst only proved their theorem for @xmath56 , but they used general expressions for most of their proof , so it is not difficult to generalise it .",
    "they used the restriction @xmath268 on only two occasions .",
    "first , it is used to show that in their notation @xmath269 , which is needed in deriving their eq ( 4.22 ) .",
    "but this is true for all @xmath3 models , because there exists a coordinate transformation in the @xmath61 surface so that @xmath270 even if @xmath271 initiallly",
    ". the proof can be found in plebanski & krasinski @xcite .",
    "because of this , we are able to write @xmath272 and our notation is well defined .",
    "second , as mentioned above , they used @xmath56 to show @xmath273 using ( [ mwlindep ] ) . a slight correction in the assumption regarding @xmath256",
