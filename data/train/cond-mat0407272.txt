    "understanding the physics of strongly correlated many body systems is a main focus of condensed matter physics today .",
    "however , most models with strong interactions can not be solved exactly except in one dimension .",
    "presently , there are no systematic non - perturbative analytic methods which work in higher dimensions . largely because of this reason , numerical simulations such as exact diagonalization ( ed ) , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , quantum monte - carlo ( qmc )",
    "are extensively performed to study strongly correlated systems . however , each of the numerical methods has its own limitations .",
    "the ed can only be performed in a very small sample size , and the dmrg method is largely restricted to one - dimensional systems .",
    "in contrast , qmc simulation is the only systematic and scalable method with sufficient numerical accuracy for higher dimensional problems .",
    "however , qmc also has the notorious fermion sign problem which makes low temperature properties inaccessible .    in lattice systems ,",
    "a particular version of qmc uses the auxiliary field method introduced by blankenbecler , scalapino and sugar @xcite , with fruitful results . because one can not directly sample the fermionic grassmann fields , the standard process is to perform a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation to decouple the four - fermion interaction terms , and then to integrate out the fermions @xcite .",
    "the resulting fermion functional determinant works as the statistical weight for sampling the auxiliary fields . however , generally speaking the fermion determinant may not be positive , and can even be complex in some cases . the sign or",
    "the phase of the fermion determinants can lead to dramatic cancellations which makes statistical errors to scale exponentially as the inverse of the temperature and size of the system .",
    "this notorious sign problem is the major obstacle in applying qmc to fermionic systems .",
    "a successful solution to the sign problem would obviously lead to great advances in quantum many body physics .",
    "there are a few exceptions where the sign problem is absent , such as the negative @xmath0 hubbard model and the positive @xmath0 hubbard model in a bipartite lattice at the half - filling @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the fermion determinant after the hs decomposition can be factorized into to two real parts with the same sign .",
    "it is therefore positive - definite .",
    "unfortunately , general fermion determinants may not be factorizable for more complicated models and the majority of models do have the sign problem . in recent years",
    ", several other algorithms have been proposed which partially solves the minus sign problem @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the minus sign problem can be eliminated without relying on the factorizibility of the fermion determinant , therefore , a broader class of models can be simulated by the qmc algorithm@xcite .",
    "the fermion determinant can always be expressed as a product of its eigenvalues ; under certain conditions , the eigenvalues of the fermion determinant always appear in complex conjugate pairs , thus making the fermion determinant positive definite . in this article",
    ", we shall show that the property of conjugate eigenvalue pairs follows from the time reversal symmetry of the hs decoupled hamiltonian , and can be viewed as a generalization of the kramers theorem in quantum mechanics .",
    "we shall call this method the _ @xmath1-invariant decomposition _ ( time reversal invariant decomposition ) . this method does not lead to any improvement for the single band hubbard model , but significantly extends the applicability of the qmc to multi - band , multi - layer or higher spin models .",
    "this algorithm is particularly useful for hubbard models with higher spins , which can be accurately realized in systems of cold atoms .",

    "however , applying our method of @xmath1-invariant decomposition without requiring factorizibility , we shall show that multi - band or higher spin hubbard models can be simulated for an extended parameter regime without scarifying the spin rotational invariance .",

    ", we shall show now that it significantly improves the qmc algorithm for multi - band , multi - layer and higher spin models , since the conditions for our theorem is far less restrictive than the condition for the factorizibility of the fermion determinant .",
