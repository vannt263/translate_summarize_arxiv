    "reliable cross - section measurements of radiative capture - reactions are of utmost importance to understand the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than iron , in particular the @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this process is believed to be mainly responsible for the production of the 30 - 35 neutron - deficient @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "since the involved cross sections are typically in the @xmath4b range or even lower , a reliable measurement is very challenging .",
    "various techniques are used for the measurement of radiative capture cross - sections .",
    "one of the most widely applied is the activation technique , which has provided a large amount of experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , this technique is limited to reactions resulting in an unstable reaction product with appropriate half - lives . in order to overcome this limitation ,",
    "mainly two different other methods are applied , namely the in - beam 4@xmath5-summing technique @xcite and the in - beam technique with high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrometer horus ( * * h**igh efficiency * * o**bservatory for @xmath1-**r**ay * * u**nique * * s**pectroscopy ) @xcite in combination with a recently developed target chamber can be used for the latter technique . with this method , the prompt @xmath1-decays of the excited compound nucleus are observed . by measuring the angular distributions using a granular high - efficiency hpge @xmath1-ray detector array like horus at the university of cologne , absolute reaction cross - sections can be determined . moreover , since the individual @xmath1-decay patterns are observed , further insight into the structure of the residual nucleus is provided .",
    "this might also lead to new nuclear structure results , @xmath6 spin and parity assignments , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , a new setup utilizing the @xmath1-ray spectrometer horus is presented . in section  [ sec : horus ] the design of the horus spectrometer is introduced followed by the target chamber dedicated for nuclear astrophysics experiments in section  [ sec : chamber ] . in section",
    "[ sec : experiments ] the results of a first experiment on the @xmath2y(p,@xmath1)@xmath3zr reaction are discussed .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrometer horus is located at the fn tandem ion accelerator at the institute for nuclear physics in cologne .",
    "it consists of up to 14 hpge detectors , where six of them can be equipped with active bgo shields in order to actively suppress the compton background .",
    "the horus spectrometer has a cubic geometry and the 14 detectors are mounted on its eight corners and six faces , respectively .",
    "thus , the detectors are placed at five different angles with respect to the beam axis , namely at , , , , and , see fig .",
    "[ fig : horus ] .",
    "this allows the measurement of angular distributions at five different angles , which is important to determine absolute cross sections .",
    "the distances of the hpge detectors to the target can be freely adjusted . due to the geometry of the target chamber and",
    "mounted bgo shields , the distances typically vary between and . because of its flexible architecture",

    "-ray spectrometer .",
    "the 14 hpge detectors are mounted on the eight cornes and six faces of a cube geometry .",
    "this allows the measurement at five different angles relative to the beam axis , namely at ( detectors 12 and 13 ) , ( detectors 7 and 8) , ( detectors 0 to 5 ) , ( detectors 6 and 9 ) , and ( detectors 10 and 11 ) . ]      the signal processing at horus is performed digitally using dgf-4c rev .",
    "f modules , manufactured by the company xia @xcite .",
    "each module provides four input channels for the preamplifier signals of the semiconductor detectors as well as four channel - specific veto inputs , which are used for the active compton - background suppression with bgo shields .",
    "the preamplifier signals are digitized by adcs with a depth of and a frequency of .",
    "the modules allow the extraction of energy and time information as well as traces of the individual digitized preamplifier signals , if required by the experimentalist .",
    "an earlier revision of these modules has been successfully applied to the data acquisition of the miniball spectrometer @xcite . using these modules , it is possible to acquire data over a wide dynamic range of up to tens of mev , which is important for astrophysical applications , since very high - energy @xmath1 rays must be observed for this purpose . by storing the data event - by - event in a listmode format ,",
    "it is possible to obtain @xmath7 coincidence data , see section [ sec : coincidence ] .      in order to obtain a reliable determination of the proton energy ,",
    "the resonance of the @xmath8al(p,@xmath1)@xmath9si reaction was used @xcite . by scanning this resonance ,",
    "one obtains a calibration of the analyzing magnet . in a first step ,",
    "the resonance was scanned by varying the projectile energy in small energy steps of down to . by normalizing the peak volume stemming from the @xmath8al(p,@xmath1 ) reaction to the accumulated charge ,",
    "a resonance yield curve was obtained , see fig .",
    "[ fig : yield_curve ] .",
    "this yield curve shows a sharp low - energy edge and a plateau .",
    "the width of the sharp rising edge of the resonance yield curve is determined by the energy spread of the incoming protons .",
    "the location of the plateau is important for the efficiency calibration at high @xmath1-ray energies , see section  [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "since the natural width of this resonance is smaller than @xcite , the width of the plateau is determined by the proton - energy loss inside the @xmath8al target . by fitting the resonance yield curve ,",
    "a spread in the proton energy of was found for the present setup .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : yield_curve ] , that the center of the rising edge of the yield curve is not located at the literature value of , but shifted by @xmath10   to higher energies .",
    "this has mainly two reasons .",
    "first , the earlier calibration of the analyzing magnet , relating the nmr measurement of the analyzing magnet to the particle energy , might not be exactly valid , since this is very sensitive to the exact geometry of the beamlines and slits defining the entrance to the analyzing magnet .",
    "for this purpose , a measurement of the exact proton energy must be done during every conducted experiment , where the particle energy must be precisely known .",
    "secondly , a finite opening angle of the slits in front of the analyzing magnet allows a geometrical uncertainty for the beam entrance into the analyzing magnet , @xmath11 a skew pathway of the beam .",
    "however , since these parameters do not change during the experiment , the beam uncertainty and energy offset can be considered as constant .",
    "this constant offset must be taken into account in the data analysis , especially when it comes to determine the energy straggling inside the target material , or when comparing the measured cross - section results to theoretical calculations .",
    "al(p,@xmath1)@xmath9si reaction .",
    "this resonance was scanned by varying the proton energy in small steps .",
    "this yield curve is used to exactly determine the energy of the incident protons as well as their energy spread .",
    "moreover , this resonance is used for a relative full - energy peak efficiency calibration for @xmath1-ray energies up to , when measuring on top of the resonance .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "the absolute full - energy peak efficiency is mandatory to derive absolute reaction cross - sections . up to a @xmath1-ray energy of about the full - energy peak efficiency",
    "can be determined using standard calibrated radioactive sources . however , for astrophysical applications , the absolute full - energy peak efficiencies for @xmath1-ray energies of up to more than must be precisely known . for this purpose , more sophisticated techniques such as measuring resonances of capture reactions or inelastic scattering reactions must be applied . for this setup ,",
    "the resonance of the @xmath8al(p,@xmath1)@xmath9si reaction was used @xcite , which allows the determination of the full - energy peak efficiency up to an energy of .",
    "the resonance with an excitation energy of is populated , when measuring on top of the resonance plateau , see fig .",

    "they can be used to determine the relative full - energy peak efficiencies , which are subsequently scaled to an absolute efficiency calibration obtained with calibration sources .",

    "[ fig : efficiency ] shows the absolute full - energy peak efficiency for a typical hpge detector used in the horus spectrometer as a function of @xmath1-ray energy .",
    "the full - energy peak efficiencies for the lower energy range up to a @xmath1-ray energy of were obtained using standard calibrated @xmath12eu and @xmath13ra sources .",
    "finally , the full - energy peak efficiencies were obtained by fitting a function of the form    @xmath14    to the experimental efficiencies .    in order to obtain a reliable efficiency determination over the whole energy region and",
    "allow for coincidence summing effects , monte carlo simulations were performed using the geant4 toolkit @xcite .",
    "these simulations agree very well with the experimentally obtained full - energy peak efficiencies over an energy range from up to the highest @xmath1-ray energy of , see fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] . due to the large distance of the hpge detector to the target and low count rates ,",
    "summing effects are negligible . below a @xmath1-ray energy of",
    ", the geant4 simulation tends to overestimate the experimental data .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the very details of the detector geometry become significant at such low energies .",
    "this includes , @xmath6 , the exact thickness of the detector end caps or dead layers of the hpge detectors , which might not be known to a sufficient precision .",
    "however , this does not play a significant role for the efficiency determination , since the full - energy peak efficiencies for the lower energies can be well determined using standard calibration sources .",
    "-ray energies higher than were obtained by using the resonance of the @xmath8al(p,@xmath1)@xmath9si reaction .",
    "the decay of this resonance provides @xmath1 rays with energies of up to , which are used for a relative efficiency determination .",
    "the remaining ones were obtained using calibrated radioactive sources .",
    "the experimental full - energy peak efficiencies are compared to the efficiencies obtained with a geant4 simulation ( dashed line ) , which shows an excellent agreement over an energy range from up to the highest @xmath1-ray energy of . ]",
    "the combination of the high granularity of the horus spectrometer and the event - by - event data format facilitates the construction of @xmath7 coincidence matrices .",
    "the @xmath7 coincidence technique is a powerful tool to suppress the beam - induced background .",
    "although it can not be applied directly to the determination of absolute cross sections , it is most helpful to unambigiously identify the @xmath1-ray transitions visible in the spectra . with this",
    ", it can be proved , for instance , that the observed @xmath1-ray transition corresponding to the reaction of interest is free from contaminants from other decaying nuclei resulting from target contaminants .",

    "the three marked transitions from higher lying states feeding the -state in @xmath3zr can hardly be recognized due to the large beam - induced background .",

    "moreover , @xmath1-ray transitions from the observed compound nucleus with a low intensity might vanish in the beam - induced background .",
    "these transitions would be missing later on , when the total cross section is determined . using the @xmath7 coincidence technique ,",
    "the beam - induced background can be reduced so efficiently , that even the weakest @xmath1-ray transitions become visible in the coincidence spectra .",
    "the absolute influence of such a transition on the cross section might not be determined using @xmath7 coincidences .",
    "but it strongly supports determining an upper limit of the impact of a transition on the total cross section , which is hidden in the beam - induced background .",
    "thus , using this method , systematic uncertainties concerning missing @xmath1-strength during the data analysis are drastically reduced .",
    "the target chamber mounted inside the horus spectrometer was optimized for nuclear astrophysics experiments .",
    "the chamber itself measures in length and in width , see fig .",
    "[ fig : targetchamber ] .",
    "the dimensions of the target chamber were kept as small as possible , in order to facilitate a preferably short distance from the hpge detectors to the target , which allows a high full - energy peak efficiency .",
    "the body of the target chamber is made of aluminum with a thickness of .",
    "it provides a tantalum coating inside with a thickness of , which is used to suppress competitive reactions on the aluminum housing .",
    "the thickness of the tantalum coating was optimized in a way , that on the one hand it is thick enough to stop protons and @xmath17-particles , but thin enough not to significantly absorb @xmath1 rays down to an energy of .",
    "moreover , this coating can be removed for activation experiments , when @xmath1 rays with lower energies have to be observed with the horus spectrometer after the activation .",
    "the target is surrounded by a copper tube cooled by @xmath18 .",
    "this tube serves as a cooling finger and is used to minimize residual gas deposits on the target material .",

    "the chamber is coated with tantalum to avoid competetive reactions on the aluminum housing .",
    "the cup closely behind the target can be tilted to stop the beam downstream the horus spectrometer . ]",
    "since the total number of particles impinging on the target must be known for the cross - section determination , the beam current is read out at three different positions .",
    "firstly , the current is measured at the target itself and at a faraday cup , which is located at a distance of behind the target .",
    "this faraday cup can be tilted , @xmath11 , one can choose to stop the beam in the faraday cup closely behind the target or the beam dump downstream the horus spectrometer .",
    "additionally , the current is separately read out at the target chamber itself , in order to measure released secondary electrons as well as scattered beam particles .",
    "the accumulated charge is individually determined by current integrators with an overall uncertainty of about . a negatively charged aperture with a voltage of at the entrance of the target chamber is used to prevent secondary electrons from hitting the beamline upstream .",
    "the target chamber additionally houses a silicon detector , which is used for rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) measurements , see fig  [ fig : targetchamber ] a ) .",
    "it is placed at an angle of relative to the beam axis at a distance of to the target to monitor target stability during the experiment and to measure the target thickness . since the rbs setup became available after the @xmath2y(p,@xmath1 ) measurement , the proof of principle for this setup",
