    "late time accelerated expansion of the universe was indicated by measurements of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . this was confirmed by observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , and the large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies observed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to account for this phenomenon within the framework of general relativity containing only matter .",
    "therefore , a number of models containing `` dark energy '' have been proposed as the mechanism for the acceleration .",
    "there are currently many dark energy models , including cosmological constant , scalar field , quintessence , and phantom models @xcite .",
    "however , dark energy , the nature of which remains unknown , has not been detected yet .",
    "the cosmological constant , which is the standard candidate for dark energy , can not be explained by current particle physics due to its very small value , and it is plagued with fine - tuning problems and the coincidence problem .",
    "an alternative method for explaining the current accelerated expansion of the universe is to extend general relativity to more general theories on cosmological scales . instead of adding an exotic component such as a cosmological constant to the right - hand side ( i.e. , the energy - momentum tensor ) of einstein s field equation , the left - hand side ( i.e. , the einstein tensor , which is represented by pure geometry ) can be modified .",
    "typical models based on this modified gravity approach are @xmath1 models @xcite and the dvali  gabadadze  porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .    in @xmath1 models , the scalar curvature @xmath2 in the standard einstein ",
    "hilbert gravitational lagrangian is replaced by a general function @xmath1 .",
    "by adopting appropriate function phenomenologically , @xmath1 models can account for late - time acceleration without postulating dark energy .",
    "the dgp model is an extra dimension scenario . in this model ,",
    "the universe is considered to be a brane ; i.e. , a four - dimensional ( 4d ) hypersurface , embedded in a five - dimensional ( 5d ) minkowski bulk . on large scales , the late - time acceleration is driven by leakage of gravity from the 4d brane into 5d spacetime .",
    "naturally , there is no need to introduce dark energy . on small scales ,",
    "gravity is bound to the 4d brane and general relativity is recovered to a good approximation .    according to various recent observational data including that of type ia supernovae @xcite",
    ", it is possible that the effective equation of state parameter @xmath3 , which is the ratio of the effective pressure @xmath4 to the effective energy density @xmath5 , evolves from being larger than @xmath6 ( non - phantom phase ) to being less than @xmath6 ( phantom phase @xcite ) ; namely , it has currently crossed @xmath6 ( the phantom divide ) .",
    "@xmath1 models that realize the crossing of the phantom divide have been studied @xcite . on the other hand , in the original dgp model @xcite and a phenomenological extension of the dgp model described by the modified friedmann equation proposed by dvali and turner @xcite , the effective equation of state parameter never crosses the @xmath3 = @xmath6 line .    in this paper",
    ", we develop the `` phantom crossing dgp model '' by further extending the modified friedmann equation by dvali and turner @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the effective equation of state parameter of dgp gravity crosses the phantom divide line , as indicated by recent observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the original dgp model , and check the behavior of the effective equation of state . in section [ sec:3 ] , we describe the modified friedmann equation by dvali and turner @xcite , and we also demonstrate that the effective equation of state does not cross the @xmath3 = @xmath6 line in this framework . in section [ sec:4 ] , we construct `` the phantom crossing dgp model '' by extending the modified friedmann equation proposed by dvali and turner .",
    "we show that the effective equation of state parameter of our model crosses the phantom divide line , and investigate the properties of our model .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the dgp model @xcite assumes that we live on a 4d brane embedded in a 5d minkowski bulk .",
    "matter is trapped on the 4d brane and only gravity experiences the 5d bulk .",
