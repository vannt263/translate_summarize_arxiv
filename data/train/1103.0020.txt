    "compounds containing rare - earth ( re ) or actinide elements display many intriguing solid state phenomena such as heavy fermion behavior and high - temperature superconductivity . when partially filled f - orbitals are involved , the ground state predicted by the density functional theory ( dft ) clearly places the f - electrons in narrow bands piled at the fermi energy @xmath3 , interacting only weakly with other electrons . in sharp contrast",
    "however signatures of f - bands are often found in spectroscopic measurements not at @xmath3 , as band theory predicts , but several evs above or below the @xmath3 depending on the nature of the spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "here we show how this dilemma can be resolved and how this seemingly contradictory behavior of f - electrons in solid - state systems can be modeled within the framework of the dft .",
    "in essence , we have carried out dft calculations constrained to simulate the process of electron excitation . in this way , we adduce that when f - bands are excited , their spectroscopic image will generally avoid @xmath3 even when these bands lie at the @xmath3 .",
    "we consider ncco as an exemplar complex system , which is interesting not only because it is a high-@xmath5 superconductor @xcite , but also because it contains nd - f bands co - existing with the broader cu - o bands @xcite .",
    "this allows us to delineate relative differences in the way localized bands get excited in comparison to the itinerant bands .",
    "our computations are based on the final state rule and the @xmath6-self - consistent field ( @xmath6scf ) method , which have been invoked previously to investigate x - ray absorption and emission @xcite , and x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) of core levels @xcite .",
    "the final state rule postulates that the electronic structure of the excited state can be obtained by using the potential of the final state in which the hole is present in the valence band , i.e. the hole is long - lived and the electronic system relaxes before the hole recombines with an electron . in standard computations ,",
    "the excitation energies are approximated by band energies , but in the @xmath6scf method the energies are significantly more realistic because they are obtained by computing the total energy difference between the unperturbed ground state and a relaxed cell calculation for the final state .",
    "our goal is to capture the fundamental mechanism responsible for why f - electron excitations avoid @xmath3 , without consideration of probe dependent matrix elements @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce a method beyond the many body perturbation theory @xcite for calculating the energy cost of localized f - state relaxations .",
    "filled states can be probed via x - ray emission or photoemission spectroscopy , and empty states through x - ray absorption or inverse photoemission or bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy , issues of surface sensitivity of photoemission notwithstanding .",
    "formally , the energy for exciting an electron requires us to compute the difference between the total energy @xmath7 of the @xmath8-particle ground state and the energy @xmath9 of an excited state of @xmath10 particles containing a hole in the @xmath11 level @xcite .",
    "the relaxed excitation energy @xmath12 of the @xmath11 filled level then is @xmath13 the energy contribution from the photon , @xmath14 , can be subtracted off , since it is not an interesting part of the relaxation energy .",
    "similarly , for the inverse process , where we add an electron into an empty state of the @xmath8-particle system , we need to evaluate the total energy @xmath15 of an excited state of the @xmath16 particle system , so that the excitation energy @xmath12 of the n@xmath17 unfilled state is @xmath18 in the absence of relaxation , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy of the @xmath11 kohn - sham orbital @xcite .",
    "the correction to this kohn - sham energy is the relaxation energy @xmath21 associated with the excitation process .",
    "the connection of groundstate kohn - sham equations to one particle energies has been studied by bauer @xcite .",
    "other authors @xcite have shown that the exchange - correlation potential @xmath22 for calculating ground state properties is the best local approximation to the exchange - correlation self - energy at the fermi level in dyson s quasiparticle equation .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates how a partially filled f - band lying at the @xmath3 , which is superposed on a broader band , will be mapped in the excitation process . if the relaxation energy @xmath23 is zero or a constant , then the spectroscopic image of the kohn - sham density of states ( dos ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) obtained , for example , via photoemission and inverse photoemission processes , will be an undistorted copy of the dos @xcite .",
    "in general , however , @xmath23 will be non - zero and differ between localized and itinerant bands , and between occupied and empty states .",
    "therefore , it is useful to introduce the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the relaxation energies of the f and itinerant bands for the occupied states , which could be probed via photoemission . similarly , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the corresponding relaxation energies for the unfilled states , which could be accessed via an inverse photoemission process .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows that when the filled portion of the kohn - sham dos is mapped , f - bands are shifted by @xmath24 and itinerant bands by @xmath25 , so that the f - bands no longer appear to be at the @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows what happens when the unoccupied portion of the dos is excited .",
    "now the f - bands move by @xmath26 and the itinerant bands by @xmath27 .",
    "the net result is that filled and unfilled portions of the dos , as seen by comparing panels ( b ) and ( c ) , will in general appear to be separated in energy in their spectroscopic images .",
    "the preceding effects arise purely from the way the excitation processes play out and reflect differences in the screening of the added hole or electron in various orbitals of the unperturbed system .",
    "is the kohn - sham fermi energy .",
    "( b ) image of the filled portion of the dos where f and itinerant bands are shifted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , in exciting an electron .",
    "( c ) same as panel ( b ) , except that here the unfilled portion of the dos is excited and the f and itinerant bands undergo relaxation shifts of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . , width=288 ]    concerning technical details , we note first that the @xmath6scf scheme works well for localized core states with pure @xmath28-character @xcite . here",
    ", we apply the scheme to a localized re f - band in ncco , where our band calculations based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite and the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite , put the nd - f band right at @xmath3 .",
    "lsda yields the correct cuo@xmath4-plane fermi surface and reasonable band dispersions in doped lsco @xcite .",
    "also , lsda correctly predicts both metallic and ferromagnetic phases in manganites @xcite . that lsda fails to describe the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) phase within the cuo@xmath4 plane in undoped cuprates is not relevant here since our focus is on the re physics .",
    "notably , however , lsda calculations for lsco using lower linearization energies describe the undoped as well as the doped system reasonably@xcite , indicating that only small corrections are needed to the lsda to bring the paramagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states into the correct order . for undoped",
    "ncco , lsda does predict a metallic re afm ground state with re order in line with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "a re ferromagnetic metallic solution is very close in energy , and it is more convenient to use for calculating excitation energies .",
    "accordingly , we will study excitations from the fictitious ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath29 , which are very similar to the excitations of the metallic compound with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "our basis set includes @xmath31 for nd , @xmath32 for cu and o , and @xmath33 for empty spheres , two of which are inserted per formula unit in the most open part of the structure .",
    "the lattice constant , @xmath34 , is @xmath35 a.u . , and the wigner - seitz radii are ( in units of @xmath34 ) : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for nd , cu , o and empty spheres , respectively",
    ". the number of irreducible k - points used is @xmath40 for a cell containing four formula units .",
    "the computed moment on each nd is @xmath41 @xmath42 while the moments on cu and o atoms are less than @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , by imposing the observed afm order on cu through a staggered field , the magnetic order on the re does not change , implying weak interaction between cu and re sites .",
    "turning to excited state simulations , we consider first the process in which an occupied electron is excited leaving behind a hole in the system .",
    "we model this hole as a hole in the local density of states ( ldos ) on a particular site ( e.g. nd , cu or o ) .",
    "specifically , the hole is created by removing electrons from the ldos over an energy window @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is a cut - off energy defined such that a total of one electron is removed .",
    "the total charge for the excited state at the site @xmath46 then is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ldos and @xmath49 is the radial wave function at the site @xmath50 with angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "[ rho ] imposes charge neutrality within the simulation cell of volume @xmath51 .",
    "this form is appropriate for xps , since at large excitation energies the wave function of the electron is free - electron like with a constant charge density @xcite . at lower photon energies ( e.g. for uv photoemission @xcite ) , @xmath52 could be replaced by the proper density for the excited state .",
    "calculations involving core levels show good convergence already for small unit cells @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the charge screening occurs near the excited site .",
    "we have embedded one excited site in a fairly large cell of @xmath53 sites , and verified that both charges and local dos on sites far from the excitation approach those of the ground state for all cases .",
    "the constraint of eq .",
    "[ rho ] is repeated for each self - consistent iteration until the total energy is converged to an accuracy of about @xmath54 ev .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath12 is calculated by a change in total energy between the ground state and the excited state as in eq .",
    "[ eq_excite ] .",
    "before discussing our results for the relaxation energies with reference to table 1 , we emphasize that in our modeling the hole does not involve a single energy level of the solid , but rather a group of states around the mean energy @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath56 are given in the second column of the table .",
    "@xmath56 is quite small ( @xmath57 ev ) for the majority ( up spin ) nd band , dominated by f - levels , so that this hole state is modeled reasonably in our scheme @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath56 for other states considered ( minority spin nd , cu , and apical and planar o atoms ) range from @xmath58 ev , and thus the hole in these cases involves a substantial mixture of states around the mean value .    focusing on the relaxation energies @xmath59 of the occupied states given in the 3rd column of the table",
    ", we see that the up spin nd state , which is almost exclusively of f - character undergoes a relaxation shift of @xmath60 ev , so that in the excitation spectrum this state will appear at an excitation energy of @xmath61 ev , i.e. at a much lower energy than in the kohn - sham spectrum .",
    "in contrast , an excitation from the down spin nd band , which contains almost no f - electron ( but involves itinerant d - electrons ) , with @xmath62 ev will appear at @xmath63 ev , i.e. at a much higher energy than for the up spin band .",
    "along these lines , cu excitations experience a relaxation correction of about @xmath64 ev , while the corrections for planar and non - planar o - atoms [ o(1 ) and o(2 ) ] are both about @xmath65 ev . as expected , the more localized levels generally suffer larger relaxation effects .",
    "in particular , the majority spin nd bands of f - character , which are most strongly localized , display the largest correction . the cu - d band is also relatively localized and undergoes substantial hole screening . but",
    "cu and o states are hybridized so that actual excitations from the itinerant cuo bands will be an average over the cu and o contributions in the table .",
    "[ this is not the case for nd - f bands , which hardly hybridize with other valence states . ]",
    "putting all this together , we estimate that an excitation from the majority nd - f will be detected @xmath66 ev lower than from other bands ( i.e. the value of @xmath67 ev in table 1 is reduced by about @xmath68 ev as the fermi level follows the cuo hybrid band ) , giving the appearance of a gap between the nd - f states and the fermi level , as shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1](b ) . the aforementioned computed downward shift of about @xmath69 ev is in reasonable accord with photoemission measurements , which find a broad peak centered at about @xmath70 ev below @xmath3 for the 4f level @xcite .",
    ".[table1 ] relaxation energies in ncco for excitations from majority- and minority - spin nd [ nd @xmath71 and nd@xmath72 , cu , and planar and apical o sites [ o(1 ) and o(2 ) ] .",
    "@xmath73 is the relaxation energy of photoemission with the hole at an average energy of @xmath74 and an excited electron above @xmath3 . for the inverse process ,",
    "the relaxation energy and the average energy of the added electron in the final state are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "all energies are in ev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     relaxation effects in the inverse excitation process are considered in the last two columns of table 1 . in this case , the final state involves an extra electron with an average energy of @xmath76 and the corresponding relaxation energy is @xmath75 .",
    "computation of the relaxation energy follows along the lines described above for the case of a final state with an extra hole , except that here we add an electron near the @xmath3 in the empty ldos on various atomic sites , and @xmath77 . in order to ensure charge neutrality , eq .",
    "[ rho ] is now modified so that the charge density term @xmath52 is subtracted ( instead of being added ) on the right hand side of eq .",
    "turning to the results for the majority nd ( f mainly ) states in table 1 , we find our key result : there is a large positive shift @xmath78 of @xmath79 ev , implying that nd - f@xmath71 bands will appear to lie at energies well above @xmath3 and above the itinerant cuo bands .",
    "in contrast to the case of photoemission , the relaxation energies of nd-@xmath80 and nd-@xmath81 are very similar .",
    "this is because both up- and down - spin f - states exist in the unoccupied nd dos , while the occupied nd dos has almost no down - spin f - electrons .    the gd is a prototypical member of the rare earths which is a suitable benchmark for testing excitations of 4f electron systems in x - ray photoemission ( xps ) and bremsstrahlung isochromat ( bis ) @xcite . in our ground state calculation for the fm configuration of gd@xmath82cu@xmath2o@xmath83 , the majority gd - f band is completely filled and at about @xmath84 ev below @xmath3 while the minority gd - f is empty and at about @xmath85 ev above @xmath3 .",
    "when we apply our corrections the estimated xps peak is at about @xmath86 ev whereas the bis peak is near @xmath87 ev , which compare fairly well with the corresponding experimental values in pure gd @xcite , about @xmath88 and @xmath84 ev respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of a hubbard band strong on - site coulomb replusion @xmath89 between electrons of opposite spin splits the band into a lower portion lying @xmath90 below the @xmath3 , and an upper portion lying @xmath90 above the @xmath3 .",
    "the gap between the upper and lower hubbard bands so created is the result of strong electronic correlations .",
    "in contrast , in the present lsda calculation the partly filled f - band is located at @xmath3 , but screening effects in the excitation process make the filled portion appear well below the @xmath3 and the unfilled portion appear well above the @xmath3 . the effective splitting between these two portions from table 1 ( first row ) , @xmath91 ,",
    "is @xmath92  ev for nd .",
    "the itinerant bands in table 1 are seen to display smaller splittings . apparently , the relaxation energy can be sizable even for itinerant valence electrons @xcite . experimental determinations of effective @xmath89 for elemental nd are in the range 6 - 7 ev @xcite",
    ". constrained lsda calculations have been performed to estimate hubbard @xmath89 parameters @xcite , and have been used to justify opening of mott gaps in the cuprates .",
    "similar methods have been applied for calculation of @xmath89 parameters for d - band impurities via relaxation energies of embedded atoms @xcite .",
    "our computational scheme is however tailored for treating the process of electron or hole excitation for a specific pair of initial and final states .",
    "therefore , our relaxation energies can not be described in terms of a single atomic parameter , although we would expect our relaxation energies to be of the order of the commonly used @xmath89 parameters .",
    "our approach is in the spirit of the early work of herbst and wilkins @xcite although ref .",
    "considers excitations from renormalized atoms within truncated wigner - seitz spheres .",
    "we also emphasize that our approach is quite different from lda+u type calculations , since we employ the constrained dft formalism and not the orbital dependent techniques invoked in lda+u @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our lsda calculations do not address mott - physics involving strong correlations , but demonstrate that final state corrections can give the appearance of a gap in spectroscopic data even in the absence of strong electron correlations .",
    "we have presented a dft - based scheme for obtaining relaxation energies relevant for excitation of occupied and empty states in various spectroscopic probes .",
    "our method is particularly suitable for f - bands and demonstrates clearly that the screening of excitations in f - bands differs substantially from that of more delocalized states .",
    "the net effect is that in the excitation spectrum the filled f - bands appear to move below the @xmath3 while the unfilled f - bands are shifted above the @xmath3 .",
    "the most important conclusion of our study is that the aforementioned shifts are induced via screening that occurs within the excitation process , even when the majority spin f - states in ncco lie at the @xmath3 in the lsda kohn - sham spectrum .",
    "we expect this screening mechanism to be applicable to f - electron systems more generally since many f - electron compounds contain narrow , partially filled f - bands at the kohn - sham @xmath3 with little hybridization with other bands .",
    "although we have assumed a high excitation energy for the generic purposes of this study , it will be straightforward to extend our scheme to consider lower energy excitations . for a realistic description of the spectral _ intensities _ in various spectroscopies",
    ", one will need to take the matrix element effects into account .",
    "furthermore , it will be interesting to examine the extent to which f - electrons in the ground state can contribute to fermi surface related properties . in particular , if ncco has f - electrons at or near the @xmath3 , which probes could detect them ?",
    "compton scattering @xcite and positron - annihilation @xcite , which are sensitive to the electron momentum density of the many - body ground state could be promising in this connection .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with g. zwicknagl and p. fulde .",
    "this work is supported by the us department of energy , office of science , basic energy sciences contracts de - fg02 - 07er46352 and de - fg02 - 08er46540 ( cmsn ) , and benefited from allocation of computer time at the nersc and nu - ascc computation centers .",
    "matrix element effects can be quite strong and generally differ greatly between different highly resolved spectroscopies such as angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite , resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , compton scattering @xcite and positron - annihilation @xcite .",
