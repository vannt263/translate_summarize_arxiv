    "an interesting energy functional for a closed spacelike surface @xmath5 introduced by hawking @xcite is defined by @xmath101 named the _ hawking energy _ this functional provides a measure of the energy content within @xmath5 .",

    "shows that @xmath105 , as expected of a flat vacuum spacetime . for schwarzschild spacetime , the famous geometry modeling a static isolated black hole of fixed mass @xmath1",
    ", sauter also shows when @xmath5 is any cross - section of the so called ` standard null cone ' @xmath106 with equality if and only if @xmath5 is ` time - symmetric ' ( @xcite , lemma 4.4 ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the special relativistic understanding that an energy measurement @xmath107 for a particle always over - estimates its mass @xmath1 except when measured within its rest frame ( i.e a frame where @xmath108 ) . +",
    "although the hawking energy enjoys monotonicity and convergence along certain flows , difficulty remains in assigning physical significance to the convergence of @xmath104 due to the lack of control on the asymptotics of such flows @xcite .",
    "we expect these difficulties may very well be symptomatic of the fact that an energy functional is particularly susceptible to the plethora of ways boosts can develop along any given flow .",
    "analogous to the addition of 4-velocities in special relativity , @xmath109 , ( as shown below ) we expect an infinitesimal null flow of @xmath5 within a fixed reference frame to raise energy due to an influx of matter .",
    "however , with no a priori knowledge of the flow , we have no way to fix or even identify a reference frame .",
    "so it is likely that ` phantom energy ' will accumulate from infinitesimal boosts along the flow in analogy with special relativistic boosts , @xmath110 ( i.e energy increases ) or @xmath111 ( i.e. energy decreases ) as shown below .",
    "geometrically we expect this to manifest along the flow in a ( local ) ` tilting ' of @xmath5 .",
    "one may even expect a net decrease in energy as is evident in schwarzschild spacetime ( recall @xmath106 ) .",
    "this is not a problem , however , if we appeal instead to mass rather than energy since boosts leave mass invariant , @xmath112 . moreover , by virtue of the lorentzian triangle inequality ( provided all vectors are time - like and either all future or all past pointing ) , along any given flow the mass should always increase : @xmath113 we hope therefore by appealing instead to a quasi local mass functional a larger class of valid flows and more generic monotonicity should arise .",
    "we approach the problem of finding such a mass functional by first finding an optimal choice of flux function for @xmath104 .",
    "+ one such flux , first introduced by christodoulou @xcite , is the ` mass aspect function ' @xmath114 associated to an arbitrary null basis @xmath115 . using @xmath116 in his phd thesis @xcite",
    ", sauter showed the existence of flows on past null cones that render @xmath104 non - decreasing making explicit use of the fact that under a boost this mass aspect function changes via @xmath23 according to @xmath117 from these observations , the divergence term in ( 1 ) ( up to a sign ) is somewhat motivated by an attempt to find a flux function independent of boosts .",
    "in fact , it follows in the case that @xmath118 and @xmath34 is past pointing , that @xmath103 can be given in terms of the bartnik data of @xmath5 as @xmath119 ( we refer the reader to section 2 for definitions and proof ) . moreover , in our two simplest cases , namely spherical cross - sections of the null cone of a point in a space form or the standard null cone of schwarzchild spacetime , the last two terms cancel identically .",
    "interestingly , work of wang , wang and zhang @xcite show deep connection between the 1-form @xmath120 and the underlying null geometry of a closed , co - dimension 2 surface @xmath5 . for @xmath5 satisfying @xmath121 they show for various ambient structures that @xmath5 must be constrained to a shear - free ( @xmath122 ) null - hypersurface of spherical symmetry . in section 2 ( proposition [ p2 ] ) we show for a connected @xmath5 of arbitrary co - dimension inside a space form , if @xmath5 is expanding along some null section @xmath9 such that @xmath123 , then it must be constrained to the null cone of point whenever @xmath122 .",
    "leaning on work by bray , jauregui and mars @xcite we also find direct motivation for ( 1 ) showing that @xmath103 arises naturally from variation of @xmath104 along null flows . + in section 2.2",
    "we motivate our quasi local mass ( 2 ) by studying the particularly simple expression that results for @xmath103 on arbitrary cross sections of the standard null cone of schwarzchild spacetime .",
    "in fact , for a standard null cone @xmath37 of mass @xmath1 we show for any spherical cross section @xmath124 that @xmath125 .",
    "+ one important application for a quasi local mass would is to use it to prove the penrose conjecture @xcite : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the area of an isolated black - hole and @xmath1 is the mass of the system . in the appropriate setting",
    "this provides not only a strengthened version of the positive mass theorem , but also insight regarding the mathematical validity of the _ weak cosmic censorship hypothesis _ that penrose employed in the formulation of his conjecture . as such",
