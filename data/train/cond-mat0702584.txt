    "modelling of self - driven particles is a recently progressing research area in physics , and opens a new paradigm in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "self - driven particles , such as vehicles , pedestrian and ants , do not necessarily satisfy newton s third law , i.e. , the law of action and reaction .",
    "this is mainly because the force acting among such particles has a psychological or social origin , and hence the reaction differs from one individual to another .",
    "therefore the behavior of these particles is not well described by the usual framework of mechanics or ( equilibrium ) statistical physics . nevertheless in the case of collective motion ,",
    "some aspects of the behavior have similarities with those seen in newtonian particles , such as phase transitions , cluster formation and occurrence of domain walls @xcite .",
    "there are several attempts to describe such self - driven particles for the last several decades , ranging from differential equations with some social forces @xcite , to cellular automaton ( ca ) models with various update rules @xcite . in this paper , we show modellings of ants and pedestrians by a cellular automaton approach in an unified way . we demonstrate similarities between ants on a trail and pedestrians in evacuations , since both try to follow others through sniffing pheromone on a trail , and information from one s eyes and ears , respectively .",
    "the behavior of pedestrians is usually not simple in normal situations , but in emergency cases like evacuation from a building on fire , people rush to exits and only simple motions are observed . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of evacuation in the modelling of pedestrians . for this case , we show that human behavior can be modeled by a naturally extended model of ants .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce our model of traffic of ants on a trail , and discuss its dynamical properties such as loose cluster formation and anomalous flow - density relation by using a solvable stochastic model .",
    "we have also performed an experiment on our ant trail model by developing a multiple robots system . in sec",
    ".  3 , a stochastic model of pedestrian dynamics is presented , which is called the _ floor field _ model .",
    "we discuss the relation of the floor field model and the ant trail model , and show simulated results of the model by taking into account the inertia of pedestrians . concluding remarks and future problems are given in sec .",
    "let us first define the ant trail model ( atm ) which is a simple model for an unidirectional motion of ants on a trail .",
    "the ants communicate with each other by dropping a chemical called _ pheromone _ on the substrate as they move forward @xcite .",
    "the pheromone sticks to the substrate long enough for the other following ants to pick up its smell and follow the trail .",
    "first we divide the one - dimensional trail into @xmath0 cells , each of which can accommodate at most one ant at a time .",
    "we will use periodic boundary conditions , that is , we consider an ant trail of a circuit type .",
    "the lattice cells are labeled by the index @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and we associate two binary variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 with each site @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath3 takes the value @xmath5 or @xmath6 depending on whether the cell is empty or occupied by an ant .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 if the cell @xmath1 contains pheromone ; otherwise , @xmath8 . since a unidirectional motion is assumed , ants do not move backward in this model .",
    "their hopping probability becomes higher if it smells pheromone ahead of it .",
    "the state of the system is updated at each time step in two stages . in stage i , ants are allowed to move , and stage ii corresponds to the evaporation of pheromone . in each stage",
    "the dynamical rules are applied in parallel to all ants and pheromones , respectively .",
    "_ stage i : motion of ants _ + an ant at cell @xmath1 that has an empty cell in front of it , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , hops forward with probability @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 if @xmath14 . here",
    "we assume @xmath15 for consistency with real ant - trails where pheromone works as an attractive chemical for ants on a trail .",
    "_ stage ii : evaporation of pheromones _ + at each cell @xmath1 occupied by an ant after stage i a pheromone will be created , i.e. , @xmath16 if @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "any free pheromone at a site @xmath1 not occupied by an ant will evaporate with the probability @xmath18 per unit time , i.e. , if @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 with probability @xmath18 and @xmath16 with probability @xmath22 .",
    "the rules can be written in a compact form as the following coupled equations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are stochastic variables defined by @xmath26 with probability @xmath18 and @xmath27 with probability @xmath22 , and @xmath28 with probability @xmath29 and @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 .",
    "we point out that eqs .",
    "( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqf ] ) reduce to the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite , which is one of the exactly solvable models , if @xmath32 is a constant , i.e. , @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath33 .",
    "if we further consider the deterministic limit @xmath34 , then this model reduces to the burgers ca @xcite , which is also exactly solvable .",
    "the asep with parallel updating has been used often as a simple model of vehicular traffic on single - lane highways @xcite .",
    "the most important quantity of interest in the context of flow properties of the traffic models is the _ fundamental diagram _ ,",
    "i.e. , the flow - versus - density relation , where flow is the product of the density @xmath35 and the average speed @xmath36 .",

    "the density - dependence of the average speed of the atm is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - effh](b ) .",
    "we first observe that the diagram does not possess particle - hole symmetry . in the asep",
    "the flow remains invariant under the interchange of @xmath35 and @xmath48 ; this particle - hole symmetry leads to a fundamental diagram that is symmetrical about @xmath49 .",
    "in the atm , particle - hole symmetry is seen in the special cases of @xmath50 and @xmath51 from fig .",
    "[ fig - effh](a ) .",
    "in these two special cases the ant - trail model becomes identical to the asep with parallel updating corresponding to the effective hopping probabilities @xmath11 ( for @xmath50 ) and @xmath13 ( for @xmath51 ) , respectively .",
    "next , over a range of small values of @xmath18 , it exhibits an anomalous behavior in the sense that , unlike common vehicular traffic , @xmath36 is not a monotonically decreasing function of the density @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - effh](b ) ) . instead",
    "a relatively sharp crossover can be observed where the speed _ increases _ with the density . in the usual form of the fundamental diagram ( flow vs.  density )",
    "this transition leads to the existence of an inflection point ( fig .",
    "[ fig - effh](a ) ) .    by a detailed study of the spatio - temporal behavior in the steady - state , we were able to distinguish three different density regimes @xcite .",
    "at low densities a loosely assembled cluster is formed and propagates with the probability @xmath13 ( fig .  [ loose ] ) .",
    "the leading ant in the cluster which hops with probability @xmath13 will determine the velocity of the cluster .",

    "parameters are @xmath52 .",
    "we see the loose clusters emerge from the random initial configuration , which will eventually merge after sufficiently long time into one big loose cluster.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the intermediate density regime , the leading ant occasionally hops with probability @xmath11 instead of @xmath13 , because it becomes possible to feel the pheromone which is dropped by the last ant in the preceding cluster .",
    "this arises from the fact that , due to the periodic boundary conditions , the gap size between the last and leading ant becomes shorter as the cluster becomes larger , so that the leading ant is likely to find the pheromone in front of it .",
    "this increase of the average speed in this intermediate - density region ( fig .",
    "[ fig - effh](b ) ) , leads to the anomalous fundamental diagram .    finally , at high densities , the mutual hindrance of the ants dominates the flow behavior leading to a homogeneous state similar to that of the asep . in this regime",
    "the loose cluster does no longer exist and ants are uniformly distributed after a long time .",
    "thus homogeneous mean field theories give a good result in accounting the fundamental diagram only in this regime @xcite .",
    "the atm is closely related to the zero - range process ( zrp ) , which is known as one of the exactly solvable models of interacting markov processes @xcite .",
    "the zrp consists of the moving particles of the exclusion process .",
    "the hopping probability of a particle depends on the number of cells to the particle in front .",
    "hence the zrp is regarded as a generalization of asep . in the atm",

    "we see that the theoretical curves are almost identical to the numerical ones , thus confirming that the steady state of the atm is described by the zrp .",
    "next we set up an experimental system of our ant model by using multiple robots that can communicate with each other through pheromone - like interaction .",
    "in this experiment , a virtual pheromone system ( v - dear ) @xcite was introduced , in which chemical signals are mimicked by the graphics projected on the floor , and the robots decide their action depending on the color information of the graphics .",

    "we consider a model for pedestrians in evacuation in this section by using a cellular automaton approach . the model is called the floor field model @xcite ( ffm ) , which is successfully used up to now for modelling panic behavior of people evacuating from a room .",

    "2 .   for each pedestrian , the transition probabilities @xmath89 for a move to an unoccupied neighbor cell @xmath87 are determined by the two floor fields .",
    "the values of the fields @xmath92 ( dynamic ) and @xmath90 ( static ) are weighted with two sensitivity parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 : @xmath97 here @xmath98 represents the inertia effect @xcite given by @xmath99 for the direction of one s motion in the previous time step , and @xmath100 for other cells , where @xmath101 is the sensitivity parameter .",
    "@xmath102 is responsible for the exclusion in a cell ; if the target cell is occupied by another pedestrian or an obstacle , then we set @xmath103 , while @xmath104 if it is free .",

    "which one is allowed to move is decided using a probabilistic method @xcite .",
    "the pedestrians who are allowed to move perform their motion to the target cell chosen in step 3 .",
    "@xmath92 at the origin cell @xmath87 of each _ moving _ particle is increased by one : @xmath106 .",
    "the above rules are applied to all pedestrians at the same time ( parallel update ) .",
    "let us now briefly explain the similarities between the ffm and the atm . considering a one - dimensional variant of the ffm , the hopping probability ( [ trap ] ) of moving forward for a pedestrian at cell @xmath1",
    "is simply written as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the number of footprints at the next cell @xmath109 . here assuming a unidirectional motion of pedestrians",

    "3 .   @xmath118 this parameter determines the strength of inertia which suppresses quick changes of the direction of motion .",

    "we focus on measuring the total evacuation time by changing the parameter @xmath101 .",
    "the size of the room is set to 100 @xmath122 100 cells .",
    "pedestrians try to keep their preferred velocity and direction as long as possible for minimizing their effort .",

    "this is because any perturbation from other people becomes large if @xmath95 increases , which causes the deviation from the minimum route .",
    "introduction of inertia effects , however , changes this property qualitatively , and the _ minimum _ time appears around @xmath125 in the case @xmath124 .",
    "this is well explained by taking into account the physical meanings of @xmath101 and @xmath95 .",
