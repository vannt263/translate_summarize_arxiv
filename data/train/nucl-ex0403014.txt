    "black solid lines show blast - wave fit results for charged pions , kaons and protons .",
    "dashed lines represent blast - wave prediction for multi - strange baryon spectra shapes based on freeze - out parameters of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "red lines are blast - wave fits for @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra .    it is predicted that at sufficiently high energy densities matter is no longer confined to hadrons but exists in a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "this new state of matter is expected to form in relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "qgp signals may remain in the bulk properties of the collision at final state .",
    "for example , the final collective transverse radial flow , due to its cumulative nature , contains any collective flow generated at partonic stages , and particle yield ratios may reflect statistical nature of the hadronization process .",
    "we present here measurements of a variety of hadron species ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) in pp and au+au collisions at 200 gev by the star experiment , and a detailed investigation of the final hadronic state properties of such collisions in the framework of chemical and local kinetic equilibrium models .",
    "the star detector is described in @xcite . the main detector , time projection chamber ( tpc ) , tracks charged particles in a uniform magnetic field of 0.5 t .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath2 , and @xmath10 are identified be ionization energy loss ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are identified by their decay topology .",
    "corrections for tracking inefficiency , detector acceptance as well as decay losses were applied .",
    "pion spectra were corrected for weak decay feed - down , muon contamination and background pions ; all other spectra include feed - down from weak decays .",
    "additional corrections for p+p spectra were applied to account for inefficiency and false rate of the vertex finder .",
    "minimum bias au+au events were subdivided into centrality classes based on measured number of charged particles within the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath15 .",
    "0.50    0.8    measured particle ratios ( symbols ) and statistical model predictions ( lines ) .",
    "blue lines represent fit results based on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "red lines show results based on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath11 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath9 data .",
    "figure 1 shows comparison of the spectra for different particle types in central au+au collisions .",
    "heavier particles show strong flattening of the spectra , consistent with radial flow resulting from high pressure gradient in the reaction zone .",
    "we fit @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath2 , and @xmath10 spectra with a hydrodynamically motivated model with common flow velocity ( also known as blast - wave model ) with kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath16 and mean flow velocity @xmath17 as fit parameters @xcite .",
    "fit results are shown in figure 1 , demonstrating good description of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 spectra by such a fit ( solid lines ) .",
    "dashed lines shown in figure 1 illustrate that blast - wave model fit to the common particle spectra fails to reproduce spectra shape of rare particles .",
    "blast - wave fits for rare particle spectra are shown as red lines in figure 1 .",
    "extracted values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given in table 1 .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that multi - strange baryons freeze - out earlier than the common particles , possibly due to their smaller interaction cross - section with the bulk of the collision zone .",
    "integrated @xmath18 values are extracted from the fit .",
    "ratios obtained from those yields are fitted within the framework of statistical model with 4 parameters : chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath19 ) , baryon and strangeness chemical potentials ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , and strangeness suppression factor ( @xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "points shown in fig.2 represent measured star data for the most central events , blue lines are statistical model results based on fit to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 measurements .",
    "the obtained values of fit parameters are listed in table 2 ( first column ) . as seen in the plot the relative abundances of strange particles",
    "are underestimated .",
    "results of statistical model fit to all the ratios ( data available are listed in the table 3 ) are shown in red in fig.2 .",
    "the thus obtained values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 agree with the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 fit results , while strangeness suppression factor is larger , giving better description of strangeness production .",
    "the results are given in the last column of table 2 .",
    "on the other hand both fits fail to reproduce star resonance measurements , which may be due to rescattering / regeneration effects after chemical freeze - out .",
    "open symbols in fig.3 summarize the centrality dependence of freeze - out parameters extracted from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 measurements : @xmath23  mev and is independent of centrality , @xmath16 decreases from @xmath24 mev ( peripheral ) to @xmath25 mev ( central ) and @xmath17 and @xmath26 increase with centrality  @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that au+au collisions of different initial conditions always evolve to the same chemical freeze - out condition , and then cool down further to a kinetic freeze - out dependent of centrality .",
    "the expansion of the system gives rise to collective flow .",
    "significant drop in the temperature suggests relatively long time duration between two freeze - outs , estimated to be at least @xmath27  fm/@xmath28 for central events  @xcite .",
    "0.50    0.8    upper panel : chemical and kinetic freeze - out temperatures from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 data ; kinetic freeze - out temperatures for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath8 data separately .",
    "lower panel : mean transverse flow velocity for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( black ) , @xmath3 ( red ) , @xmath4 ( green ) , @xmath11 ( blue ) , and @xmath8 ( purple ) .",
    "the fit results for @xmath29 data are shown at @xmath30 .",
    "it also appears that the chemical freeze - out temperature from our fit is close to the lattice qcd predicted @xcite critical temperature of @xmath31  mev ( shown as a red line in fig.3 ) .",
    "figure 3 also shows the _",
    "kinetic _ freeze - out parameters from blast - wave fits to other particles .",
    "the @xmath3 results of those fits are shown as function of centrality ( red symbols ) ; the fit results of other particles are for central collisions . the data , although with large uncertainties , seem to indicate sequential kinetic freeze - out of particles : @xmath4 and @xmath3 decouple from the system right after chemical freeze - out , followed by other particles ( @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "also it appears that the kinetic freeze - out of @xmath32 and @xmath33 baryons coincide with chemical freeze - out for all centralities .",
    "it is therefore a tempting to conclude that the @xmath34  @xmath28 extracted from @xmath32 and @xmath33 spectra characterize radial flow at chemical freeze - out , which is possibly build up prior hadronization in the earlier , probably partonic , stage of the collision .",
    "in summary , star has measured a wide variety of hadron species produced in 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "the data are studied within the framework of chemical and local kinetic equilibrium models to investigate final hadronic state properties of heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "the major results of our study are :    * a chemical equilibrium model fit to the ratios yields a @xmath19 insensitive to centrality .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath35  mev is close to the qcd predicted phase transition temperature . *",
    "kinetic freeze - out temperature of multi - strange baryons shows no sensitivity to collision centrality and coincides with chemical freeze - out temperature for all centralities .",
    "the obtained flow velocity @xmath34  @xmath28 may be considered as that at hadronization .",
    "* blast wave model fit to the transverse mass spectra of different particle species indicates likely sequential kinetic freeze - out ( @xmath4 , @xmath3,@xmath9 @xmath36 @xmath11 , @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath8 ) and allows to estimate radial flow velocity at the chemical as well as kinetic freeze - out . * kinetic freeze - out parameters obtained from blast - wave fits of @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 spectra",
    "are correlated with centrality : the more central the collision , the lower extracted temperature and the higher collective radial flow velocity . for the 5% most central collisions , @xmath37  mev , @xmath38  @xmath28 .",
    "the drop in temperature from @xmath19 to @xmath16 and the development of strong radial flow suggest a significant expansion and long duration from chemical to kinetic freeze - out , estimated to be at least @xmath27  fm/@xmath28 in central collisions .    the results seem to suggest the following picture at rhic : au+au collisions of various centralities , despite different initial conditions , always evolve toward the same chemical freeze - out temperature ( or possibly hadronization ) ; chemical freeze - out",
    "is followed by cooling and expansion , and a sequential decoupling of particles dictated by their hadronic cross - sections : multi - strange baryons decouple at chemical freeze - out , followed by other particles decoupling at later times .",
