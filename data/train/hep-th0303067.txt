    "the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gsl ) @xcite roughly speaking states that one quarter the area of black hole horizons plus the entropy outside the horizons is nondecreasing .",
    "this law was formulated in an attempt to repair inconsistencies in the ordinary second law in the presence of black holes .",
    "there is no precise general statement , let alone proof , of the gsl , but it has been demonstrated in a compelling variety of special circumstances .",
    "it indicates a deep connection between geometry , thermodynamics and quantum mechanics which we have yet to fathom . the holographic principle @xcite , which also has no precise general statement , endeavors to elevate and extend the gsl to contexts not necessarily involving black holes . in @xcite , a mathematically precise modification of the gsl / holographic principle",
    "was proposed that is applicable to null surfaces which are _ not _ horizons @xcite .",
    "this proposed ",
    "bousso bound \" , along with a generalization stated therein , was proven , subject to certain conditions , in a classical limit by flanagan , marolf , and wald @xcite .",
    "the bousso bound , as stated , can be violated by quantum effects @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the proofs of the bound rely on the local positivity of the stress tensor which does not hold in the quantum world . physically , the bound does not account for entropy carried by hawking radiation . in this paper",
    ", we propose that , at a semiclassical level , the bound can be restored by adding to one quarter the surface area the entanglement entropy across the surface .",
    "we will make this statement fully precise , and then prove it , in a two - dimensional model of large n dilaton gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by reviewing bousso s covariant entropy bound in section 2 .",
    "we will review the lightsheet construction in general d - dimensional spacetime , although our main interest in the remainder of the paper will be four and two dimensions . in section 3 , we will discuss how bousso s bound can be violated in the presence of semiclassical effects , like hawking radiation . this will motivate us to propose a `` quantum bousso bound '' in section 4 . by assuming an adiabaticity condition on the entropy flux , we will show in section 5 that the classical bousso bound can be proven in four and two dimensions . in section 6 , we extend the analysis to the two - dimensional rst quantization @xcite of the cghs model @xcite which includes semiclassical hawking radiation and its backreaction .",
    "we will show that the quantum bousso bound holds in this gravitational theory .",
    "the bousso bound asserts that , subject to certain assumptions , the entropy of matter that passes through certain lightsheets associated with a given codimension two spatial surface in spacetime is bounded by the area of that surface @xcite .",
    "this entropy bound provides a covariant recipe for associating a geometric entropy with any spatial surface @xmath0 that is codimension two in the spacetime . at each point of @xmath0 , there are four null directions orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "these four null directions single out four unique null geodesics emanating from each point of @xmath0 : two future - directed and two past - directed . without loss of generality , we choose an affine parameter @xmath1 on each of these curves such that @xmath1 equals zero on @xmath0 and increases positively as the geodesic is followed away from @xmath0 .    along each of the four geodesics , labelled by @xmath2 , an expansion parameter @xmath3 can be defined .",
    "if we note that each of the future - directed geodesics is simply the extension of one of the past - directed geodesics , then the following relations between the expansion parameters becomes clear : @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , at least two of the four geodesics will begin with a nonpositive expansion .",
    "a `` lightsheet '' is a codimension one surface generated by following exactly one non - expanding geodesic from each point of @xmath0 .",
    "each geodesic is followed until one of the following occurs on it :    * the expansion parameter becomes positive , @xmath6 , * a spacetime singularity is reached .    note that , in spacetime dimensions greater than two , there are an infinite number of possible lightsheets to choose from since , for each point on @xmath0 , there are at least two contracting null geodesics from which to choose .    the original bousso bound conjectures that nature obeys the following inequality : @xmath7 in order to make this statement precise , we must clarify what we mean by the entropy that passes through a lightsheet . in general , this is ambiguous because entropy is not a local concept .",
    "however , there is a thermodynamic limit in which the entropy is well - approximated by the flux of a four - vector @xmath8 . as discussed by flanagan , marolf , and wald ( fmw ) in @xcite , this thermodynamic limit is satisfied under the entropy condition that we will use in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "the bousso bound as formulated so far pertains mainly to this limit .    to find the entropy flux that passes through the lightsheet",
    ", we must project @xmath8 onto @xmath9 , the unique future - directed normal to the lightsheet .",
    "up to a sign , @xmath10 is @xmath11 since @xmath11 is null and orthogonal to all other lightsheet tangent vectors by construction . in order to keep @xmath12 future - directed ,",
    "we choose @xmath13 if the lightsheet is future - directed , and @xmath14 if the lightsheet is past - directed . since we use the mostly - positive metric signature ,",
    "the entropy flux through any point of the lightsheet is @xmath15    in the language of entropy flux , the entropy bound becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the lightsheet of @xmath0 .",
    "however , there is a generalized bousso bound @xcite in which the lightsheet is prematurely terminated on a spatial surface @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear that the integral of @xmath19 over this terminated lightsheet equals the integral over the full lightsheet of @xmath0 minus the integral over the full lightsheet of @xmath18 . assuming that @xmath19 is everywhere positive , bousso s original entropy bound tells us that @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the lightsheet of @xmath0 terminated on @xmath18 . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the generalized bousso bound , first proposed by fmw @xcite , which imposes the much stronger bound on the terminated lightsheet : @xmath22 this has been proven under suitable assumptions by fmw @xcite .",
    "note that this generalized entropy bound directly implies bousso s original entropy bound .",
    "the entropy bounds so far pertain largely to the classical regime .",
    "when quantum effects are included , even at the semiclassical level , we expect that the bounds must be somehow modified to account for the entropy carried by hawking radiation .",
    "mathematically , the proofs @xcite are not applicable because quantum effects violate the positive energy condition .",
    "the classical proofs hinge on the focussing theorem of classical general relativity .",
    "the focussing theorem , in turn , derives from the raychaudhuri equation and the null energy condition .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation provides a differential equation for the expansion parameter along a null geodesic @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the shear tensor and @xmath25 is the twist tensor . for a family of null geodesics that start off orthogonal to a spatial surface , such as the case for a lightsheet , the twist tensor is zero .",
    "finally , if we assume that the null energy condition holds , then the last term is negative .",
    "the null energy condition postulates that @xmath26 is nonnegative for all null vectors @xmath12 . as a result",
    ", we find that the expansion parameter satisfies the inequality @xmath27 this gives us the focussing theorem : if the expansion parameter takes the negative value @xmath28 along a null geodesic of the lightsheet , then that geodesic will reach a caustic ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) within the finite affine time @xmath30 .",
    "so long as energy is required to produce entropy , the focussing theorem ensures that the presence of entropy will cause the lightsheet to reach a caustic and , therefore , terminate .",
    "the more entropy we try to pass through the lightsheet , the faster the lightsheet terminates .",
    "this gives a compelling argument for why only a finite , bounded amount of entropy could be passed through the lightsheet .",
    "according to the bousso bound , this upper bound is precisely one quarter the area of the generating surface .    in practice",
    ", the covariant entropy bound can be violated in the presence of matter with negative energy . by mixing positive - energy matter and negative - energy matter",
    ", a system with zero energy can be made to carry an arbitrary amount of entropy .",
    "again , the entropy passing through any given lightsheet could be increased arbitrarily . at the classical level",
    ", we could simply demand that the energy - momentum tensor obeys the null energy energy condition .",
    "this is the weakest of all the most common energy conditions and , as can be seen from ( [ eqray ] ) , is the one needed for the focussing theorem , and thus to make the bousso bound plausible .",
    "however , the bousso bound is in serious trouble once we include quantum effects . we know that none of the local energy conditions can hold even at first order in @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of hawking radiation violates the null energy condition near the horizon of black holes .",
    "this allows for violations of the focussing theorem .",
    "this violation can be seen most clearly for future - directed , outgoing null geodesics that hover for a while in between the event horizon and apparent horizon of an evaporating black hole .",
    "the apparent horizon is the boundary of the region of trapped surfaces , so the congruence of null geodesics are contracting inside the apparent horizon .",
    "however , as the black hole evaporates , the apparent horizon follows a timelike trajectory towards the event horizon .",
    "the null geodesic could then leave the apparent horizon and begin expanding , in violation of the focussing theorem .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , lowe constructs a related counterexample to the covariant entropy bound in the presence of a critically illuminated black hole .",
    "critical illumination is the process in which matter is thrown into a black hole at exactly the same rate as energy is hawking radiated away . in this scenario",
    ", the apparent horizon follows a null trajectory .",
    "if we pick the apparent horizon to be the generating surface for a lightsheet , then the lightsheet will coincide with the apparent horizon as long as we continue to critically illuminate the black hole . by critically illuminating the black hole",
    "sufficiently long , we can pass an arbitrary amount of matter through the lightsheet .",
    "in this way , the entropy of the matter passing through the lightsheet can be made larger than the area of the apparent horizon , thus violating the entropy bound .",
    "hence , the original bousso bound only has a chance of holding in the classical regime .",
    "once we include one - loop quantum effects , such as hawking radiation , the bound fails . in the remaining sections , we propose a modification of the bousso bound which may hold in the semiclassical regime",
    "the generalized bousso bound , when specialized to black hole horizons , is equivalent to a classical limit of the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gsl ) . to see this , note that the portion of the event horizon lying between any two times consitutes a lightsheet . since all matter falling into the black hole between those two times",
    "must pass through this lightsheet , the generalized entropy bound gives us the same information as the gsl .",
    "in particular , we learn that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the change in event horizon area , and @xmath34 is the entropy of the matter that fell in .",
    "when quantum effects are included , the form ( [ eqgsl ] ) of the generalized second law is no longer valid .",
    "the quantum gsl states , roughly speaking , that the total entropy outside the black hole plus one quarter the area of the horizon ( either event or apparent depending on the formulation ) is non - decreasing .",
    "the entropy outside the black hole receives an important contribution from hawking radiation .",
    "therefore , we must augment the left hand side by the entropy of the hawking radiation : @xmath35 in general , we do not know how to formulate , let alone prove , an exact form of the gsl in a full quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however , approximations to it have been formulated and demonstrated in a wide variety of circumstances @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 term is crucial in these demonstrations , without which counterexamples may be easily found .",
    "since the gsl requires an additional term at the quantum level , and the gsl is a special case of the generalized buosso bound , we should certainly expect that the bousso bound will receive related quantum corrections .",
    "these corrections should reduce to @xmath37 when the lightsheets are taken to be portions of event horizons .",
    "the problem is to precisely formulate the nature of these corrections .    in this context",
    "it is useful to think of the entropy in hawking radiation as entanglement entropy .",
    "evolution of the quantum fields on a fixed black hole geometry is a manifestly unitary process prior to singularity formation .",
    "nevertheless entropy is created outside the black hole because the outgoing hawking quanta are correlated with those that fall behind the horizon .",
    "when a region of space @xmath38 is unobservable , we should trace the quantum state @xmath39 over the modes in the unobservable region to obtain the observable density matrix @xmath40 , @xmath41 since the full state is in principle not available to the observer , there is a de facto loss of information that can be characterized by the entanglement entropy @xmath42 in general , this expression has divergences and requires further definition , which will be given below for the case of two dimensions .",
    "choosing @xmath38 to be the region behind the horizon , we can therefore formally identify @xmath43 this motivates a natural guess for quantum corrections to the bousso bound when the initial and final surfaces are closed .",
    "one should add to the area the entanglement entropy across the surface . applying this modification to the classical bousso bound ( [ eqclassbound ] ) results in a quantum bousso bound of the form : @xmath44",
    "since we can not presently hope to solve this problem or even define this quantum bound in exact quantum gravity , in order to go further we need to identify a small expansion parameter for approximating the exact theory .",
    "a useful parameter , which systematically captures the quantum corrections of hawking radiation , is provided by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of matter fields and @xmath47 is held fixed @xcite . in @xcite it was shown in the two - dimensional rst model of black hole evaporation that the ( suitably defined ) gsl , incorporating the hawking radiation as in ( [ eqmgsl ] ) , is valid .",
    "one might hope that a similar incorporation can save the bousso bound .    in the process of the investigations in @xcite it emerged that the sum @xmath48 arises naturally in the theory as a kind of quantum - corrected area . in this paper , we propose that the required leading @xmath45 semiclassical correction to the generalized bousso bound simply involves the replacement of the classical area with this quantum corrected area .",
    "a precise version of this statement will be formulated and proved in the rst model in section 6 .",
    "in this section we reproduce proofs of classical bousso bounds .",
    "we first give a proof due to bousso , flanagan , and marolf of the generalized bousso bound in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this simplified proof follows from conditions on the initial entropy flux and an adiabaticity condition on the rate of change of the entropy flux which differ somewhat from the conditions assumed in @xcite .",
    "we then describe a two dimensional version of the proof obtained by spherical reduction .",
    "a small modification of this gives a proof of the generalized bousso bound in the classical cghs model @xcite , which is then transcribed into kruskal gauge for later convenience .",
    "the inclusion of quantum effects in the latter will be the subject of the next section .",
    "following @xcite , the integral of the entropy flux @xmath19 over the lightsheet can be written as @xmath49 in this expression , we have chosen a coordinate system @xmath50 on the spatial surface @xmath0 , @xmath51 is the determinant of the induced metric on @xmath0 , and the affine parameter on each null geodesic of the lightsheet has been normalized so that @xmath52 is when the geodesic reaches @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath53 is the area decrease factor for the geodesic that begins at the point @xmath54 on @xmath0 . in terms of @xmath55 , it is given by @xmath56\\ , .\\ ] ] the physical intuition for equation ( [ fmweq ] ) is simple . as we parallel",
    "propagate a small coordinate patch of area @xmath57 from the point @xmath58 on @xmath0 to the point @xmath59 on the lightsheet , the area contracts to @xmath60 .",
    "the proper three - dimensional volume of an infinitesimal cube of the lightsheet is @xmath61 , and this volume times @xmath62 gives the entropy flux passing through that cube . in order to prove the generalized entropy bound , it is sufficient to prove that @xmath63 for each of the geodesics that comprise the lightsheet .    using a mostly positive metric signature ,",
    "the assumed entropy conditions are    i. : :    @xmath64 ii . : :    @xmath65 ,    where we use the notation , both here and henceforth , that primes denote differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath1 .",
    "condition * i * is very similar to one of the conditions in @xcite .",
    "it can be interpreted as the requirement that the rate of change of the entropy flux is less than the energy flux , which is a necessary condition for the thermodynamic approximation to hold .",
    "condition * ii * requires only that the covariant entropy bound is not violated infinitesimally at the beginning of the lightsheet . since the square root of @xmath66 routinely appears in calculations , we borrow the notation of fmw and define @xmath67    from the raychaudhuri equation , we have that @xmath68 where @xmath24 is the shear tensor , and the inequality follows from the fact that @xmath69 always .",
    "now we see that @xmath70 consequently , @xmath71 we have shown that , given our entropy conditions , the entropy passing through a lightsheet is bounded by one quarter the difference in area of the two bounding spatial surfaces .",
    "this is precisely the statement of the generalized bousso bound .",
    "it is interesting to note that nowhere in the proof did we need to use the contracting lightsheet condition .",
    "the only indication that we should choose a contracting lightsheet comes from the boundary condition * ii*. we see from condition * ii * that , in order to allow a positive , future - directed entropy flux , the derivative of @xmath66 must be negative . if the lightsheet were expanding at @xmath72 , then a timelike entropy flux would have to be past - directed at @xmath72 .",
    "note also that bousso s entropy bound can be saturated only if @xmath73 for all @xmath1 . in light of the raychaudhuri equation ( [ eqray2 ] ) , we see that @xmath74 and the shear @xmath24 must be zero everywhere along the lightsheet in order for @xmath75 to remain zero .",
    "the bound can be saturated only in this most trivial scenario",
    ". this will not be the case for other gravitational theories we will study , such as the cghs dilaton model , where saturation of the bound can occur in the presence of matter .",
    "our goal is to study the entropy bound in two dimensional models where our semiclassical analysis will be greatly simplified . as a guide to what phenomenological conditions we should be using in 2d models , we will first rederive the previous proof for the purely spherical sector of 4d einstein - hilbert gravity .",
    "we begin with the 4d einstein - hilbert action coupled to some matter lagrangian density , @xmath76 : @xmath77 writing the four - dimensional metric as @xmath78 and integrating over the angular coordinates we find the action is reduced to @xmath79\\ , .\\ ] ] here , the 2d matter lagrangian density @xmath76 is related to @xmath80 by @xmath81 from the equations of motion , we conclude that @xmath82 whenever @xmath10 is a null vector . in this expression , @xmath83 is the energy - momentum tensor for @xmath76 , not @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear from the four - dimensional metric that the classical `` area '' of a point in the 2d model is @xmath85 .",
    "however , had we only been given the action , we could identify the `` area '' of a point as being proportional to the factor multiplying the ricci scalar in the lagrange density . if that were not convincing enough , we could study the thermodynamics of a black hole solution of the two - dimensional model . in particular , we would first determine the mass of a stationary black hole solution and then compute the temperature of the hawking radiation on this geometry ( neglecting backreaction ) . integrating the thermodynamic identity @xmath86 and identifying @xmath87 as one - quarter the area of the event horizon",
    ", we arrive at an expression for the area of the event horizon in terms of the local values of the various fields there .",
    "we then designate this function of local fields as the expression that gives us the `` area '' of any point in the two - dimensional space .",
    "deriving the two - dimensional entropy conditions is a simple matter of rewriting the four - dimensional conditions in terms of two - dimensional tensors .",
    "for example , we replace @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "we are also interested in the two - dimensional entropy flux @xmath90 which is related to the four - dimensional entropy flux @xmath91 by @xmath92 .",
    "this relation is a simple consequence of the fact that the 2d flux at a point equals the 4d flux up to an overall factor of the area of the corresponding @xmath93 . replacing 4d tensors with 2d tensors ,",
    "we arrive at the following entropy conditions :    i. : :    @xmath94 ii . : :    @xmath95    note that we continue to use @xmath96 and primes denoting @xmath11 .",
    "putting it all together , the derivation of the entropy bound goes through in the same way as it did in the 4d case . in detail",
    ", we find @xmath97 therefore , @xmath98 which is exactly the 4d entropy bound , only derived from the 2d perspective .",
    "although we have derived an entropy bound in a 2d model using 2d entropy conditions , we were guaranteed success since we had spherically reduced a successful 4d proof .",
    "we now attempt to apply the same entropy conditions to another 2d dilaton gravity model , namely the cghs model @xcite .",
    "the cghs model can also be derived as the spherical reduction of a 4d model , but with charges . in",
    "what follows , we will work purely at the 2d level without any recourse to higher - dimensional physics . the cghs action coupled to @xmath46 conformal matter fields with lagrangian density @xmath76",
    "is @xmath99\\ , .\\ ] ] for a null vector @xmath12 , the equations of motion give @xmath100 to determine the classical `` area '' of a point , we look at the coefficient of the ricci scalar and learn that it is proportional to @xmath101 . by studying black hole thermodynamics ,",
    "the constant of proportionality can be fixed as @xmath102 .    to prove the entropy bound , we start with the following assumptions :    i. : :    @xmath103 ii . : :    @xmath95    we will continue to use @xmath96 and primes denoting @xmath11 . putting it all together ,",
    "we find @xmath104 therefore , we find the desired relation : @xmath105      in the previous section , we derived the cghs entropy bound with manifestly covariant equations of motion and entropy conditions . however ,",
    "once we add the one - loop trace anomaly , we are only able to obtain local equations of motion in conformal gauge . furthermore , our calculations are greatly simplified in kruskal gauge .",
    "therefore , it behooves us to rederive the cghs result in kruskal gauge .",
    "we will assume that the lightsheet moves in the decreasing @xmath106 direction .",
