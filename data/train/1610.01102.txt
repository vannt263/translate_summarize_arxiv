    "conventional bottomonium is an approximately non - relativistic system . out of 34 expected @xmath11 energy levels below the @xmath4 threshold  @xcite 15",
    "have been observed  @xcite .",
    "the masses and decays of these states are well described by potential models  @xcite .",
    "there are five states with @xmath12 pairs above the @xmath4 threshold : three isospin - zero vector states @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ or @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 according to the potential model assignment ] , and two isospin - one axial states @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the isospin - one states are obviously exotic with minimal quark content @xmath18 .",
    "but the isospin - zero states also have properties unexpected for a pure @xmath12 pair .",
    "the mass splitting between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 is larger by @xmath19 than that between the @xmath20 and @xmath0 , while for a pure @xmath12 system it is expected to be smaller by about @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the rates of @xmath22 and @xmath23 transitions are two orders of magnitude higher than expected for a pure bottomonium  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 transitions , that in a pure bottomonium involve spin of heavy quark and are suppressed by three orders of magnitude relative to @xmath25 transitions , are not strongly suppressed in case of the @xmath1  @xcite and are even enhanced in case of the @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "more puzzling results on hadronic transitions are discussed below .",
    "thus , there is a strong evidence that the structure of the vector states above the @xmath4 threshold is more complicated than the pure @xmath12 , i.e.  it is exotic .    in this paper",
    "we briefly review the experimental status of the `` botomonium - like '' states , their interpretation and prospects for future studies .",
    "our main goal is to discuss what we can learn about them based on the increased @xmath0 and @xmath1 data samples at belle - ii , and what dedicated data taking is needed .",
    "we propose to perform a high - statistics energy scan from the @xmath4 threshold up to the highest possible energy to measure exclusive open and hidden flavor cross sections .",
    "we also propose to collect data at the peak of @xmath5 and at higher mass states  if they are found in the energy scan  to study their properties and to search for missing bottomonia , @xmath26-wave @xmath3 mesons or exotic states  partners of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "favored interpretation of the bottomonium - like states is related to the presence of heavy mesons in their wave functions .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states have purely molecular structures , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , while the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 states are mixtures of the @xmath12 and @xmath29 pairs [ with @xmath30 we denote @xmath26-wave excitations of @xmath2 or @xmath3 mesons ] .",
    "we discuss measurements that are needed to establish this interpretation and point out strategy to search for other types of exotic hadrons  compact tetraquarks  @xcite or hadroquarkonia  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss the results obtained using on - resonance data , since they constitute the bulk of our current knowledge about the bottomonium - like states , and then move to the discussion of the energy scans .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the physics program for the proposed dedicated data taking .",
    "the results on bottomonium - like states presented in this section are based on large data samples collected by the belle and babar experiments . these are @xmath31 and @xmath32 collected by belle and babar , respectively , at the @xmath0 , and @xmath33 collected by belle at the @xmath1 . in the @xmath5 region",
    "only scan data are available  five points with a total luminosity of @xmath34 that correspond to @xmath35 collected in the peak",
    ".      known hadronic transitions from vector bottomonium and bottomonium - like states and corresponding partial widths are presented in table  [ tab : partial_widths ] final states , since they proceed entirely via the intermediate @xmath36 states  @xcite .",
    "we do not subtract the @xmath36 contributions from the @xmath37 final states ; they should be relatively small in all transitions except @xmath38 . ] .    .",
    "known hadronic transitions from vector bottomonium(-like ) states and corresponding partial widths . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : thresholds ]    the regions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are basically within the current reach of the superkekb collider of 11.24gev .",
    "an increase of the energy by at least 100mev will give a possibility to explore the @xmath41 threshold region and to search for baryon - antibaryon molecular states .",
    "such states are almost certainly there , as can be judged from the charmonium sector  @xcite .",
    "it is also quite important to find a high - mass state to serve as a source of missing bottomonia below the @xmath4 threshold and of molecular states ",
    "partners of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as discussed in sections  [ sec : zb_partners ] and [ sec : missing_bottomonia ] . the thresholds for various transitions are listed in tables  [ tab : transitions_to_missing_bb ] and [ tab : zb_partners ] . the maximal threshold is at @xmath42 . in order to cover the molecular states at the @xmath43 thresholds the peak should be above @xmath44 .",
    "this is the region of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 thresholds .",
    "finally , investigation of the complete region of resonances would require to increase the energy up to 12gev .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the @xmath40 threshold , which is within the current reach of superkekb .      based on the heavy quark symmetry one should expect existence in the @xmath51-flavored sector of analogs of the charmed strange @xmath52 and @xmath53 mesons : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "their expected masses can be estimated within the heavy quark expansion as 5715mev and 5763mev , respectively .",
    "these mesons can be produced in @xmath56 annihilation in pairs with the ground - state strange @xmath3 and @xmath57 mesons .",
    "moreover , an @xmath58-wave production is allowed for the pairs @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the thresholds for the former two channels practically coincide at the c.m .",
    "energy of 11.13gev , while for the latter the threshold is expected to be at approximately 11.18gev , and one can expect , due to a presence of the @xmath58-wave , a measurable production cross section at energies just above the threshold . the final states in these processes",
    "necessarily contain @xmath3 and @xmath62 mesons , and the excited @xmath54 and @xmath55 strange bottom mesons can be sought for by studying the spectrum of the invariant mass recoiling against a reconstructed @xmath3 meson .",
    "another interesting possibility may potentially arise if there is a molecular @xmath58-wave resonance , @xmath63 , near the threshold of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 pairs , i.e. near 11.13gev .",
    "an existence of such a resonance ( or a double resonance ) can be affected by the coincidence of the thresholds for the two types of pairs ( which is not the case for the final state @xmath61 ) .",
    "one can expect that such a resonance , in addition to decay channels with open @xmath51 flavor , would have a small , but possibly measurable , branching fraction for decay into bottomonium and light mesons : e.g. @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ) , or @xmath66 .",
    "[ the former decay is somewhat similar to the part of decays @xmath67 not associated with the @xmath36 resonances .",
    "the branching fraction for this part is in the ballpark of ( a few)@xmath68 . ]",
    "thus a scan of these channels with hidden strangeness near the c.m .",
    "energy of 11.13gev can reveal existence of molecular resonances with the excited strange bottom mesons - wave production in @xmath56 annihilation of the pairs @xmath69 and @xmath70 at and/or above their common threshold at 4.43gev .",
    "the available data of a study using initial state radiation at belle  @xcite indicate a certain activity in the final state @xmath71 above 4.4gev with possible structures .",
    "however more detailed data on the yield of strange @xmath72 mesons and/or of @xmath71 in that energy range are needed for further conclusions . ] .",
    "it can be also mentioned that @xmath58-wave decays into @xmath73 are also allowed for @xmath63 , in analogy with the decay @xmath74 , although it is not clear at present , how strong the breaking of hqss , that is required for such decays , is . however , if these transitions from @xmath63 proceed at a measurable rate , they can include the decay @xmath75 and thus provide a unique gateway to studies of the @xmath76 state of bottomonium .",
    "all hidden - beauty hadrons above the @xmath4 threshold have properties inconsistent with their interpretation as pure @xmath12 bottomonia . the vector bottomonium - like states @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ or the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 ] are likely mixtures of conventional @xmath12 bottomonia and pairs of @xmath4 or @xmath78 mesons in ground or excited states .",
    "the isospin - one axial states @xmath16 and @xmath17 likely have purely molecular structures of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . we propose a dedicated data taking program that will establish the above interpretation , check its predictions and search for new bottomonium and bottomonium - like states .",
    "we propose to perform a high - statistics energy scan from the @xmath4 threshold up to the highest possible energy , with @xmath79 per point and @xmath80 step .",
    "these data will allow to measure cross sections of @xmath81 annihilation into exclusive open - flavor and hidden - flavor final states , such as @xmath4 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath78 , @xmath85 , @xmath37 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and others .",
    "combined analysis of these cross sections using coupled - channel framework will determine all basic properties of the vector bottomonium - like states , such as their pole positions and interchannel couplings .",
    "these results are crucial for establishing the nature of the vector bottomonium - like states .",
    "the hidden - flavor channels will be used to search for states that do not exhibit themselves in the total cross section or in open - flavor channels ; among such states could be compact tetraquarks and hadroquarkonia .    the states with molecular admixture are naturally located near the corresponding threshold",
    ". the present energy limit of the superkekb accelerator of 11.24gev will allow to investigate the @xmath39 and @xmath40 threshold regions .",
    "increase of maximal energy by at least 100mev will allow to explore the @xmath41 threshold region and search for baryon - antibaryon molecular states , which should be there , as can be judged from the charmonium sector .",
    "the region of promising thresholds extends up to 12gev .",
    "observation of new vector states is of utmost importance for studies of molecular states ",
    "partners of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "transitions from high mass bottomonium - like states provide a unique way to produce purely molecular states .",
    "energy above 11.5gev is of special interest , as most of the relevant hadronic transitions become kinematically allowed .",
    "thus searches for the molecular states provide additional motivation for increase of the superkekb energy up to at least 11.5  11.6gev .    at each new vector state",
    "we propose to collect @xmath88 to perform a detailed study of corresponding transitions , since they provide information on the structure of the state , to search for missing conventional bottomonia and to search for molecular states .",
    "a region near the @xmath40 threshold is also of interest to search for missing @xmath26-wave @xmath3 mesons .",
    "available data at @xmath5 are limited to @xmath34 that were taken at five scan points , with the effective luminosity of @xmath35 . only the most prominent transitions @xmath23 and @xmath89 are known .",
    "an observed pattern of transitions is somewhat different from that at the @xmath1 , despite that the two states are close in energy .",
    "more detailed comparison requires an increase of statistics at the @xmath5 and could provide interesting information on the structure of both states .",
    "given that many transitions were observed at the @xmath1 and there are still channels to be investigated , the list of measurements to be performed at the @xmath5 is quite long .",
    "even non - observation of some channels will be of interest for comparison of the @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath5 data will provide a rich physics output even for relatively small ammount of a few tens of @xmath90 .",
    "this makes @xmath5 an attractive option for the belle - ii initial data taking .",

    "there are several difficulties with the determination of the @xmath1 and @xmath5 partial widths .",
    "first , in @xmath91 there is a sizeable continuum contribution , thus the denominator is likely overestimated .",
    "second , the on - resonance @xmath1 data were taken not in the maximum of the @xmath37 cross section , but about half way down the slope .",
    "similarly , the @xmath5 data were taken at five points distributed over the peak region .",
