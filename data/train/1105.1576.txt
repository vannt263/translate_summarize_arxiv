    "but before we get to the proof of our main theorem , we would like to show how one can re - prove the main theorem of  @xcite using the approach of this paper .",
    "we hope that it will shed some light both on this paper and on  @xcite .",

    "this space is the subject of  @xcite .",
    "now we would like to analyze it along with @xmath14    our first step in analyzing @xmath18 and @xmath14 is to express the `` taylor towers '' of these spaces arising from weiss embedding calculus  @xcite as ( roughly speaking ) spaces of maps between modules over the little disks operad .",
    "the main construction of embedding calculus approximates a functor @xmath37 with another functor @xmath62 , which is determined by the restriction of @xmath37 to subsets of @xmath19 that are diffeomorphic to a finite disjoint union of open balls . under favorable circumstances ,",
    "the map @xmath63 is a weak equivalence .",
    "let @xmath64 be the open unit ball in @xmath3 and let @xmath65 denote the disjoint union of @xmath5 copies of @xmath64 .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is an open submanifold of @xmath3 , and we define a standard embedding of @xmath65 into @xmath19 to be an embedding that on each copy of @xmath64 is a composition of inclusion , translation , and multiplication by a positive scalar .",
    "let @xmath66 be the space of standard embeddings of @xmath65 into @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath66 is equivalent to the space of ordered @xmath5-tuples of distinct points in @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the little @xmath12-balls operad .",
    "we will sometimes write @xmath68 when we want to emphasize that @xmath67 really stands for a sequence of spaces .",
    "it is easy to see that the sequence @xmath69 is a right module over @xmath67 .",
    "since we assume that @xmath4 contains @xmath3 as a subspace , the operad @xmath70 also has the structure of a right module over @xmath67 .",
    "recall that @xmath41 is the normalized singular chain complex on @xmath24 . since @xmath71 is a lax monoidal functor , applying it to the little balls operad yields an operad in chain complexes - @xmath72 .",
    "the sequences @xmath73 and @xmath74 are right modules over @xmath72 .",
    "it turns out that the taylor tower of the functor @xmath75 can be expressed as the space of derived maps between these modules .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the derived space of maps between right modules .",
    "there is a natural equivalence @xmath77 this is essentially remark  [ remark : back to modules ] , except that for technical reasons in the body of the paper we will work with discrete versions of @xmath67 and @xmath78 , rather than with the topological versions . but",
    "let us not worry about this too much during the introduction .",
    "the main observation of  @xcite is that kontsevich s formality theorem implies that if we work rationally then @xmath79 can be replaced in the above formula with @xmath80 .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath19 is an open submanifold of @xmath3 and @xmath81 , we have an equivalence of chain complexes @xmath82 here the action of @xmath72 on @xmath83 is essentially a trivial action , factoring through the commutative operad , @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that we can replace maps between @xmath72-modules with maps of @xmath84-modules .",
    "a right @xmath84-module is the same thing as a contravariant functor from the category of finite sets to the category of chain complexes .",
    "in particular , the sequence @xmath85 has a right @xmath84-module structure .",

    "[ prop : change of operads isomorphism ] there is a `` change of operads ''",
    "equivalence @xmath87    the point of the proposition is that the right hand side is quite a bit simpler than the left hand side . as a consequence",
    ", we have the following theorem    suppose that @xmath19 is an open submanifold of @xmath3 and @xmath88 .",
    "there is an equivalence of rational chain complexes @xmath89    this theorem can be viewed as an alternative formulation of the main result of  @xcite ( a formulation that avoids an explicit mention of orthogonal calculus ) .",
    "it gives a homotopy - theoretic description of the rational homology of @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , the following statement , which is one of the main results of  @xcite , is an immediate consequence of the above theorem    let @xmath91 , @xmath92 be two manifolds satisfying the assumption of the theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are related by a chain of maps inducing an isomorphism in rational homology .",
    "then there is an isomorphism @xmath93    if @xmath91 and @xmath92 are related by a chain of rational homology equivalences , then the right @xmath84-modules @xmath94 and @xmath95 are weakly equivalent ( in the category of right @xmath84-modules with values in rational chain complexes ) . by the theorem",
    ", the homotopy type of the right @xmath84-module @xmath96 determines @xmath97 .",
    "now we would like to carry out a similar analysis for the space @xmath14 .",
    "there is a version of the taylor tower that applies to this functor ( the relative taylor tower of  @xcite ) .",
    "our first task is to express this taylor tower in terms of modules over operads . in other words",
    ", we are looking for an analogue of  . to this end",
    ", we use the concept of a `` weak bimodule '' over an operad ( definition  [ def : weak bimodule ] ) .",
    "this term was first introduced by the second author in  @xcite . in the differential graded context",
    "this structure was called `` infinitesimal bimodule '' by merkulov and vallette  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that weak bimodules can play the same role in the study of @xmath14 as right modules do for @xmath18 .",
    "this is one of the key insights of the paper .",
    "given weak bimodules @xmath98 over an operad @xmath99 , let @xmath100 denote the derived morphism complex from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",

    "@xmath103    when @xmath6 , formula   is related to sinha s cosimplicial model for the space of long knots in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "indeed , sinha s cosimplicial space can be interpreted as the space of weak bimodule maps from the associative operad ( which is equivalent to @xmath104 ) to @xmath70 .    because weak bimodules are similar to right modules , the formal manipulations that were done in  @xcite for right modules can be repeated , and we may conclude , using the formality theorem , the following    suppose that @xmath81 . then there is an equivalence @xmath105    as before , the weak @xmath72-bimodule structure on @xmath106 pulls back from a weak bimodule structure over the commutative operad @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that we may replace maps between weak @xmath72-bimodules with maps between weak @xmath84-bimodules .",
    "it turns out that weak @xmath84-bimodules are essentially the same thing as right @xmath20-modules . after a series of reductions , we obtain the following equivalence @xmath107 from here , theorem  [ thm : main computation ] follows .      in sections  [ section : operads modules ] and",
    "[ section : operads as categories ] we recall some basics about operads and their modules .",
    "we also review the concept of a weak bimodule over an operad , which is not very well - known .",
    "we show that the category of right modules over an operad , as well as the category of weak bimodules , are equivalent to certain categories of diagrams . in sections  [ section : little balls ]",
    "we apply the general theory to obtain a convenient description of the categories of right modules and of weak bimodules over the little disks operad . in section  [ section : module maps ]",
    "we show how the taylor towers for @xmath75 and @xmath108 can be described in terms of maps between , respectively , right modules and weak bimodules over the little disks operad . in section",
    "[ section : applying formality ] we start working over the rationals , and we show how kontsevich s theorem on the formality of the little disks operad can be used to drastically simplify our models for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in section  [ section :",

    "this allows us to prove the main theorem .    in the easy section  [ section : splitting ]",
    "we derive the equivalence  . in section  [ section : koszul spectral sequence ] we show how filtering the category @xmath20 by cardinality gives rise to a spectral sequence ( which we call the koszul spectral sequence ) for calculating the homology groups of the complex of maps between right @xmath20-modules . after some preparatory work in sections  [ section : koszul dual ] and  [ section : configurations spaces revisited ] we show , in section  [ section : koszul complex ] , that in the cases of interest to us the first term of the koszul spectral sequence consists of a single chain complex .",
    "we call these chain complexes koszul complexes .",
