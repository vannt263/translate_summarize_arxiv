    "complexation between surfactants and macromolecules has generated a great deal of research , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "this research is motivated in part by the role surfactant - macromolecule complexes plays in biological systems  @xcite , where the adsorption of a variety of macromolecules onto charged lipid cell membranes is a precursor to many important biological processes .",
    "the complexation of charged surfactants and macromolecules , besides its relevance to biological physics , carries interesting questions about the interplay of short - range interactions between surfactants and macromolecules , as compared with long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "we consider a multicomponent monolayer where the possibility of a lateral phase demixing between the various constitutes exists and is characterized by a demixing ( miscibility ) curve in the temperature - concentration plane . for very long polyelectrolyte ( pe ) chains ,",
    "the electrostatic interactions have two opposite effects on the adsorption .",
    "electrostatic attraction between surfactants and pe chains increases the complexation , while the electrostatic repulsion between the pe monomers tends to decrease the complexation .",
    "this interplay also stimulated the interest in the adsorption of polyelectrolytes on oppositely charged surfaces  @xcite .",
    "several authors have addressed a closely related problem of neutral polymers adsorbing on a surfactant monolayer  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for polymer - surfactant systems the surfactant demixing occurs for higher temperatures as compared to a pure surfactant system .",
    "other works dealt with another similar problem of globular proteins ( rigid macromolecules with no flexibility ) adsorbed on charged membranes  @xcite .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite also deals with the adsorption of one flexible polyelectrolyte chain on a surfactant monolayer using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the possibility that the polyelectrolytes can desorb entirely from the charged surface when the solution has sufficiently strong ionic strength  @xcite was not previously discussed .    in this paper , we analyze the demixing of surfactants on the monolayer plane using numerical solutions of the mean - field equations .",
    "we find that the short - range interactions between the pe and the surfactants have a greater effect on the shape of the phase separation curve than the long - range electrostatics .",
    "three regimes for the surfactant - polyelectrolyte complexes are found : ( i ) a depletion regime , where the polyelectrolytes do not adsorb at all onto the surfactant layer ; ( ii ) an electrostatic adsorption regime , where the main attractive interaction between surfactants and polyelectrolytes is the electrostatic attraction ; and ( iii ) a chemical adsorption regime , where the main interaction between the polyelectrolytes and the surface is short - ranged ( chemical ) and attractive . in the first two regimes , the surfactant demixing curve ( binodal line )",
    "decreases in comparison to that of the pure surfactant monolayer , while in the third regime the demixing curve increases .",
    "we also find that for the electrostatic adsorption regime , the adsorbed amount for a system in the coexistence region is almost the same as a monophasic system with the same average concentration . in the chemical adsorption case",
    "the adsorbed amount increases more substantially due to the phase demixing .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we start by introducing the free - energy functional for a pe solution with salt in contact with a charged surfactant monolayer . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "consider an aqueous solution of polyelectrolyte chains and salt ions .",
    "the bulk pe solution is in contact with a planar and rigid interface , on which resides an insoluble monolayer of charged surfactants .",
    "this monolayer can be thought of as a langmuir monolayer at the air - water interface , or as the outer leaflet of a lipid bilayer membrane .",
    "the charged surfactants are assumed to be able to move freely on the interface , but can not dissolve into the solution ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the free energy of such a system is composed of three contributions .",
    "the monolayer free energy @xmath0 , the solution free energy @xmath1 and the interaction free energy @xmath2 .",
    "we use a standard lattice - gas formalism  @xcite to derive the demixing free energy of the surfactant monolayer :    @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the close packing area of the surfactant head groups .",
    "the first two terms account for the surfactant entropy of mixing , where @xmath5 is the surfactant area fraction .",
    "the third term represents a short - range interaction between the surfactants with @xmath6 as the interaction parameter .",
    "the fourth term is electrostatic contribution of the charged surfactant layer , where @xmath7 is the valency of the surfactant head group ( assumed henceforth to be negative ) and @xmath8 is the surface potential on the monolayer plane in units of @xmath9 .    without the fourth term , @xmath0 is the free energy commonly used for neutral langmuir monolayers . for simplicity , we take it to be symmetric under the exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "the non - convexity of @xmath0 implies that there is a demixing region with two phases : ( i ) a dense phase with high surfactant concentration , and ( ii ) a dilute phase with low surfactant concentration .",
    "the phase demixing curve is determined by :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the binodal line . below a critical value @xmath13 and for @xmath14 the monolayer phase separates into two coexisting phases . inside the coexistence region , another line of interest is the spinodal line , satisfying @xmath15 . the spinodal line , separating the unstable and metastable regions with respect to surfactant density fluctuations , is given by :    @xmath16    its maximum coincides with that of the binodal line at the critical point , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , examination of the spinodal line gives a good initial approximation to the phase behavior .",

    "the strength of the pe - surfactant interaction is defined by a phenomenological parameter @xmath42 , which has usints of volume . for positive values of @xmath42 ,",

    "the surface is indifferent (  special transition \" line )  @xcite . for @xmath45 and low surfactant concentrations @xmath46 ,",
    "the short - range interactions between the surface and the pe are repulsive , while for higher surfactant concentrations @xmath47 these interactions are attractive .    in order to find the equilibrium state of the pe - surfactant system",
    "we minimize the total free energy , @xmath48 with respect to the local small ion densities @xmath49 , electrostatic potential @xmath50 and monomer order parameter @xmath51 .",
    "this minimization yields the following equations  @xcite :    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the debye - hckel length scale for the screening of the electrostatic potential in the presence of added salt and @xmath55 is the corresponding length for the potential decay due to counterions .",

    "2a we present the phase diagram in the plane ( @xmath67 , @xmath5 ) differentiating the three regimes in the case of @xmath45 , namely , when the surfactant - pe interaction is more favorable than the pe - bare surface interaction . for @xmath46 ,",
    "in the area marked e , the short - range interaction between the surface and the pe chains is repulsive , and the adsorption is dominated by the electrostatic attraction between the pes and the surfactants",
    ". for high amounts of added salt , this electrostatic attraction is screened , and the pe chains deplete ( marked d )",
    ". for @xmath47 , ( marked c ) the pe chains chemically adsorb on the surface for all @xmath67 .",
    "the electrostatic interactions in this region are dominated by the monomer - monomer electrostatic repulsion , and hence the addition of salt increases the adsorption , rather than causing depletion . in fig .",
    "2b we show the opposite case of @xmath43 . in this case",
    "the line separating the phases is no longer monotonic . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the adsorption is mainly chemical , and is enhanced by addition of salt . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the adsorption becomes electrostatic and depends on @xmath67 .",
    "the amount of salt necessary for depletion decreases with @xmath5 for low @xmath5 since the increase in @xmath5 increases the short - range repulsion between the surface and the pe chains , while the surface charge is not strong enough to electrostatically attract the pes . for higher @xmath5 , the increase in the surface charge with @xmath5 increases mainly the electrostatic adsorption , and the necessary amount of salt increases with @xmath5 .",
    "_ repulsive surface _  the spinodal lines of repulsive pe - surfaces ( @xmath68 ) for several values of @xmath67 are presented in fig .",
    "the spinodal of the pure surface monolayer , eq .",
    "( [ surfspino ] ) , is shown to be always higher than any of the charged - surface spinodals .",
    "all three spinodal lines are almost symmetric under the change @xmath69 , and the critical points are very close to the        pure surface one at @xmath17 . in fig .",

    "like the spinodal line , the numerical binodal is almost symmetric with respect to the change @xmath71 . for high @xmath5 values , all spinodal lines of fig .",
    "3a overlap almost identically , showing that the dependence of the spinodal on the amount of added salt is very weak . for low @xmath5 values , careful observation of the three spinodal lines shows a difference between the lines , where the low salt lines are higher than the high salt ones .",
    "the three lines join together at @xmath72 ( see arrow ) .",
    "this difference between the spinodal lines results from the pe depletion at low @xmath5 . for low @xmath5 values ,",
    "the spinodal resembles a depletion spinodal , where addition of salt has a strong effect on the spinodal . for higher @xmath5 values ,",
    "the surface charge is high enough to allow pe adsorption .",
    "all three lines then move toward the electrostatic adsorption spinodal , that is weakly dependent on salt .",
    "the point where all lines join together is where the high salt spinodal crosses over from the depletion regime to the electrostatic adsorption regime , and its numerical value agrees with the adsorption - depletion crossover at @xmath73 m of salt taken from fig .",
    "the spinodal lines in the different regimes are discussed further in sec .",
    "[ analitical ] .    in fig .",
    "4 the adsorbed amount @xmath74 is plotted as a function of the surfactant surface coverage @xmath5 for @xmath70 m . we set @xmath75 in figs .  4a , 4b , respectively .",
    "the adsorption is seen to be positive only from a threshold surface coverage @xmath76 , which is similar to the crossover point between spinodal lines shown in fig .",

    "the adsorbed amount increases linearly with the surface coverage , in agreement with previous results  @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to note the effect of the adsorption - depletion crossover on @xmath77 in the coexistence region . in fig .",
    "3b we mark on the binodal line the coexisting phases for @xmath78 ( dashed line ) and for @xmath79 ( dashed - dotted line ) . in fig .",
    "4 we show @xmath77 for the same coexisting phases . using the lever rule construction  @xcite , @xmath77 inside the phase coexistence lies on a straight line between the two marked phases . for @xmath78 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "4a ) , the pe adsorbs in one of the phases while depleting from the other . as a result ,",
    "the adsorption in the phase separated region is always higher than onto a reference single phase ( solid line ) , having the same mean surface coverage @xmath5 , for @xmath79 the pe adsorbs on the two coexisting phases .",
    "the adsorption in the phase separated region ( dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "4b ) is almost identical to the adsorption to the single corresponding mixed phase ( solid line ) , and there is no gain in the adsorption due to demixing .",
    "the difference between these two behaviors can be qualitatively explained by the following argument . in the electrostatic adsorption case ,",
    "the adsorbed amount of monomers scales linearly with the surface charge  @xcite , and hence also with @xmath5 .",
    "the adsorption of the pe chains aims mainly to balance the surface charge , and since the demixing does not change the overall surface charge , the total adsorbed amount does not change as well . in the case of a depletion phase- adsorption phase coexistence ,",
    "the charges on the low @xmath5 ( depletion ) domain are screened by salt ions , while the higher surface charge domains are screened by the pe chains . in this case , even if the total surface charge is too weak to allow pe adsorption in a single mixed phase , the phase separation allows adsorption at a part of the surface area , and thus allows for a positive adsorbed amount .",
    "the crossover between these two behaviors is at @xmath80 , corresponding to the low @xmath5 phase being at @xmath81 .",
    "namely , that the low @xmath5 phase is at the adsorption - depletion transition .    _ short - range attractive surface _  the opposite case of a short - range attractive surface is presented in fig .  5 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the spinodal line is much higher than the corresponding pure - surface spinodal line , and it is far less symmetrical .",
    "the addition of salt is shown to increase the spinodal temperature .",
    "this increase with salt can be explained by both the screening of the electrostatic repulsion between the lipids , and by the increase in the adsorbed amount of monomers in this case  @xcite , which increases the effective attraction between the lipids . the corresponding adsorbed amount of monomers is shown in fig .",
    "the adsorbed amount here is convex in @xmath5 , showing that the adsorption to a demixed two - phase system is always larger than to a single phase system .",
    "_ attractive - repulsive crossover _  in fig .",
    "7 we show the spinodal lines of monomers for @xmath82 and both @xmath70 m and @xmath83 m .",
    "it is easily seen that the low salt spinodal is higher than the high salt one for @xmath46 ( repulsive surface ) , while the opposite occurs for @xmath47 , consistent with fig .",
    "although all three regimes occur in this spinodal , the curve has only one critical point , located near the crossover between the spinodal behavior of the electrostatic adsorption limit to the chemical adsorption limit , at @xmath84 .",
    "this shows that the transition of the spinodal line between the regimes is gradual rather than abrupt .",
    "the @xmath70 m line changes convexity at @xmath85 , creating a  shoulder \" in the spinodal .",
    "this shoulder marks the transition from a depletion regime to an electrostatic adsorption regime . for extremely strong short - range interactions ( very high @xmath42 )",
    ", this shoulder may transform into a triple point on the spinodal .",
    "however , we did not find such a triple point numerically for reasonable values of our parameter .    in fig .",
    "8 the adsorbed amount for @xmath82 is plotted against the surface coverage @xmath5 .",
    "for low @xmath5 values , we see the pes deplete , similar to fig .  4 , while for higher @xmath5 the adsorption crosses over from a linear electrostatic adsorption profile to a convex chemical adsorption profile .",
    "the addition of salt decreases the adsorption for low @xmath5 values , and increases it for higher surface coverage .",
    "note , however , that the crossover between the two salt dependencies is not at @xmath44 but for a lower @xmath5 .",
    "this result is in agreement with a previous one  @xcite , which shows that when the short - range repulsion between the surface and the pe chains becomes small enough , the adsorbed amount starts to increase with @xmath67 even before the surface becomes attractive , due to an increase in the surface monomer concentration @xmath86 .",
    "so far we discussed the case where the short - range interactions between the pe chains and the surfactant are more favorable than with the bare surface ( @xmath45 ) . in the case of a neutral polymer , changing the sign of @xmath42 is exactly equivalent to replacing @xmath87 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , in our case the fact that the surfactant and polymers are oppositely charged breaks this symmetry .    for very strong short - range interactions ( large negative @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 , a triple point can emerge in the following way . for low @xmath5 values ,",
    "the spinodal resembles the attractive surface spinodal .",
    "the spinodal line in this region is always higher than the pure surface spinodal eq .",
    "( [ surfspino ] ) , as was shown in fig .  5 .",
    "for @xmath90 , the spinodal line decreases substantially to the depletion spinodal , and for @xmath91 it moves to the electrostatic adsorption spinodal . both of the latter spinodal lines are similar to those in fig .",
    "3a , both are lower than the pure surface spinodal , and have a critical point at @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , there must be a triple point at @xmath93 , connecting three coexisting phases : ( i ) a low @xmath5 chemical - adsorption phase ; ( ii ) a low adsorption phase ; and ( iii ) an electrostatic adsorption phase , as shown in fig .",
    "9 .    in fig .",

    "the phase coexistence connects either a depletion phase or an electrostatic adsorption phase with another electrostatic adsorption phase .",
    "a triple point connecting all three phases occurs for @xmath95 .",
    "in this section we present a theory to explain the three pe - surfactant regimes , and , in particular , aimed at explaining the physics behind the spinodal behavior in each regime .",
    "we derive an approximate form for the free energy in each regime , and show the resulting spinodal line .",
    "our model is based on the scaling results of refs .",

    "the analytical equations can be compared to the numerical results with good accuracy , as shown below .      when @xmath96 the surface repels the pe chains , and thus the only driving force for adsorption is the electrostatic attraction between the surfactants and the pe chains .",
    "this electrostatic attraction strongly depends on the amount of small ions in the solution  @xcite .",
    "when this amount increases beyond a threshold value , the salt ions neutralize the surface and pe charges , and the solution behaves like a neutral polymer solution . in this case , the repulsive short - range interaction between the pe chains and the surface causes the pe chains to desorb entirely from the surface .",

    "is highly charged , more than the initial surface  @xcite . in this case , the main electrostatic contribution to the free energy comes from the monomer - monomer repulsion , rather than the electrostatic attraction to the surface .",
    "when the amount of small ions in the solution is small , the length scale for electrostatic potential decay is the same as that of the monomer concentration .",
    "the single length scale allows us to use similar scaling ideas as in the repulsive surface case .",
    "the highest monomer concentration occurs at the surface itself @xmath131 , and acts as the scale for the monomer concentration .",
    "similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , we can produce scaling rules for the monomer adsorption using a flory - like free energy .",
    "the free energy in this case is :    @xmath132    where the first term is again the contribution of the chain elasticity , the second term is the short - range attraction of the polymer chains to the surface , and the last term is the electrostatic repulsion between the monomer layers .",
    "the electrostatic interactions between the surface and the monomer concentrations are assumed to be small in comparison to the short - range ones , and are omitted from this free energy .",
    "minimization of this free energy yields the following scales for @xmath112 and @xmath86 :    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is a constant of order unity . the adsorption free energy is negative , as expected , and is very strongly dependent on the strength of the short range interactions .",
    "the total free energy is now the sum of the pure monolayer free energy and the adsorption free energy , and the spinodal line can be readily obtained as :    @xmath135    where we denote @xmath136 . in this case , the spinodal temperature @xmath137 is always larger than the corresponding temperature of the pure - surface spinodal .",

    "both of the spinodal equations show good agreement with the numerical lines , using the values @xmath125 for the repulsive surface case and @xmath142 for the attractive surface case .",
    "the analytical model given above for the two adsorption regimes is accurate only for the case of low amounts of added salt .",
    "this is because the main assumption is the existence of a single length scale for the decay of the electrostatic potential and the monomer concentration .",

    "we present numerical and analytical results for the phase separation of a surfactant monolayer in presence of polyelectrolytes ( pes ) .",
    "we show that the short - range interactions between the surfactant and polyelectrolytes have a strong impact on the surfactant critical temperature and critical concentration .",
    "we also present analytical results in two limits : ( i ) strong short - range repulsive , and ( ii ) attractive surfactant - polyelectrolyte interactions .    for short - range repulsive interactions ,",
    "our results show that surfactant phase separation occurs for lower temperatures than for a non - interacting surfactant layer . for such systems",
    ", the polyelectrolyte chains may desorb completely from the low surfactant concentration domains , while for higher concentration phases the pe adsorption increase linearly with the surfactant surface coverage .",
    "the critical surfactant concentration slightly deviates from the bare one @xmath17 , showing nearly symmetrical spinodal and binodal lines .",
    "in addition , we find a temperature range in which phase separation does not increase the pe adsorption . for lower temperatures , where the phase separation occurs between a strongly adsorbing phase and a depleting phase , the gain in adsorption becomes substantial . for short - range attractive interactions ,",
    "in contrast , the phase separation always increases adsorption , and the demixing temperatures are always larger than the pure - surface ones .",
    "the critical point moves more significantly away from the pure - surface symmetric value .",
    "the convexity of the adsorption is more pronounced , showing that phase separation indeed increases the pe adsorption on the surfactant monolayer . in intermediate cases , where the short - range interaction between the polyelectrolyte chains and the surface changes sign as function of the surfactant surface coverages ,",
    "a triple point can be found on the binodal line connecting three coexisting phases on the same surface .",
