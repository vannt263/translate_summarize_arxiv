    "in contrast to monolayer graphene , where the linear dispersion ( dirac cones ) near each corner of the brillouin zone ( * k * and * k@xmath4 * points ) is very difficult to alter , the low - energy band structure of blg can be qualitatively modified by relatively weak external perturbations .",
    "for example , a transverse electric field opens a mini - gap in the blg spectrum.@xcite also , it has been shown that a relatively small uniaxial strain ( of only a few percent ) leads to a change in the topology of the low - energy dispersion , which then exhibits two dirac mini - cones near each corner of the brillouin zone ( see fig .",

    "the information encoded in the two - terminal conductance of such a device of finite length is complementary to what is manifested by the sheet conductivity of an infinite flake discussed in ref .",
