    "hadronic atoms give valuable information about strong interactions at low energy . for a review , see , e.g.,@xcite .",
    "they have also motivated several studies on the behavior of the energy levels in a schrdinger operator , with a potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 dominates at large distances , but is superseded by @xmath6 at short distances .",
    "the case of exotic atoms corresponds to a world with three dimensions , where @xmath7 ( as a negatively - charged hadron orbits near the nucleus and is almost unscreened by the remaining electrons , if any ) , and @xmath6 describes the short - range hadronic interaction .",
    "but the situation is far more general , and many features do not depend on the coulomb character of @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , we shall use the word `` exotic atom '' for such a system , `` atomic '' for the energy domain of the eigenstates of @xmath5 alone , and `` nuclear '' for any typical energy within @xmath6 alone , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the spectral problem of exotic atoms @xcite differs significantly from the ordinary perturbation theory , for which an expansion of the eigenenergies in powers of @xmath8 is attempted . for exotic atoms , the energies for @xmath9 are often very close to the ones for @xmath5 alone , but perturbation theory usually does not hold .",
    "for instance , if @xmath10 is an infinite hard core of small radius , the energies are slightly shifted upwards , but the ordinary perturbative expansion diverges already at the first order .",
    "the proper concept here is `` radius perturbation theory '' , as described by mandelszweig @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss how exotic atoms behave in @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "it may be noted that the study of exotic atoms in @xmath12 is more straightforward , and already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 case is more delicate .",
    "the leading order term for the energy shift is easily identified , and linked to @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the scattering length in the short - range potential . as in the @xmath14 case ,",
    "the overall coefficient is the square of the wave - function at the origin in the external potential .",
    "however , the scale regularizing this leading term , i.e. , the radius @xmath3 leading to @xmath15 is not immediate , but it can be derived from a matching of the solution of @xmath5 which is normalizable to the asymptotic solution emerging from the short - range term @xmath10 .",
    "the case of @xmath11 dimensions is rather special in spectral problems , as it corresponds to the largest value of @xmath16 for which an attractive potential , however weak , always holds at least one bound state , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "hence , for @xmath17 , if @xmath6 is attractive , @xmath18 immediately develops its own bound state , which becomes the ground state of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , this process is less effective for @xmath11 than for @xmath12 , and the spectrum , as a function of @xmath8 evolves more slowly",
    ".    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] and sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] , we give a brief reminder about the cases of @xmath14 and @xmath12 space dimensions respectively , with particular emphasis on the phenomenon of level rearrangement and on the scattering length ( hereafter referred to as sl ) formula for the energy shifts . in sec .",

    "there is an abundant literature about exotic atoms in three dimensions , motivated by experiments with pionic , kaonic and antiprotonic atoms @xcite .",
    "the simplest model consists of a two - component potential @xmath19 where @xmath5 is a long - range interaction with one or several bound states .",
    "genuine exotic atoms correspond to @xmath20 . the second term , with an explicit strength @xmath8 introduced for the ease of the discussion , accounts for the short - range interaction .",
    "the main results are :    * the shift is usually rather small , although @xmath10 can be very large at short distances , * the shift is usually well described by the approximate formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalized wave function for @xmath23 , and @xmath1 the scattering length in @xmath6 alone . in case @xmath5 is coulombic , one recovers the well - known sl formula by deser , golberger , bauman and thirring , and trueman @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the bohr radius and @xmath26 the principal number for the energy @xmath27 in @xmath5 alone or @xmath28 in the total potential .",
    "many improvements and further corrections to this formula have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "* when @xmath8 is varied , the shift usually varies very slowly , except near the specific values @xmath29 , @xmath30 ,  , where the energy levels change very rapidly , and a _ level rearrangement _ occurs : near @xmath31 , the @xmath32 energy drops toward very large ( negative ) values in the nuclear domain , and is replaced in the upper part of the spectrum by the next level , which in turn is replaced by the next one , etc .",

    "the main differences , as compared to the more familiar @xmath14 case are :    * as soon as @xmath8 slightly departs from zero , the atomic ground state energy immediately drops towards the range of the nuclear energies . * as a coupling threshold in @xmath10 is reached and @xmath8 further increases , a plateau is observed ; the corresponding energy drops , and , by rearrangement , a upper level makes another plateau near the same value .",
    "this plateau in the sector of the _ even _ parity states , corresponds to an unperturbed energy level in the _ odd _ sector of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , the orthogonality with the ground state forces a zero in the wave function near @xmath42 , and mimics an odd state .",
    "* the deser  trueman formula , if translated for @xmath12 , reads @xmath43 the presence of the scattering length @xmath1 in the denominator can be understood by dimensional analysis .",

    ", we impose that the solution remains normalized , i.e. , @xmath67 by combining for @xmath57 and @xmath68 , one obtains the exact relation @xmath69 which gives for the energy shift @xmath70 a first relation @xmath71 .",
    "it is rather precise . indeed ,",

    "this expression is easily translated for negative energies @xmath59 , and , anyhow , the range of @xmath51 which is explored is small as compared to the typical energy scale in the short - range potential , and thus the solution coming out is safely approximated by its small @xmath51 limit @xmath91 this means one can replace @xmath13 by @xmath92 to probe the contribution of the effective range , which turns out negligible , provided the energy shift @xmath46 remains small as compared to @xmath62 .      to illustrate , we consider as long range interaction an attractive delta - shell of strength @xmath93 and radius that can be set to @xmath94 to fix the length scale .",
    "the solution can be worked out analytically , in particular @xmath95 is regular at large @xmath96 and @xmath97 at small @xmath96 .",
    "the delta - shell interaction imposes the continuity of the radial solution @xmath55 near @xmath98 and the proper step in its derivatives , to fix the unperturbed energy @xmath62 .",
    "a second delta - shell can be implemented at @xmath99 , leading to an explicit transcendental equation for the exact energy @xmath51 , and shift @xmath100 , to be compared to the simple approximate value @xmath101 and the improved @xmath102 given by . for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 ,",
    "one gets @xmath106 i.e. , an almost perfect agreement , when the @xmath107 correction is taken into account .      as an example involving smooth potentials",
    ", we consider the exponential potential @xmath108 with @xmath109 and take @xmath110 for the long - range interaction , and study the changes due to another exponential interaction , @xmath111 with a much shorter range @xmath112 and a variable strength .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbexp ] .",
    "again , there is a net gain as compared to the ordinary perturbation theory , and a good agreement with the exact calculation as long as the deviation from the unperturbed energy is not too large .     with @xmath110 , @xmath109 and @xmath112 .",
    "]      the problem is to study how the levels , in particular the ground state , are modified when a @xmath11 harmonic oscillator is supplemented by a short - range interaction .",
    "a recent contribution is by farrell and van zyl @xcite .",
    "they first stressed the property of _ universality _ , namely that the energy shift does not depend on the details of the short - range potential , but instead is governed by the scattering length alone .",
    "this is , indeed , a very general property of the exotic atoms , in the general sense define in the introduction @xcite . for @xmath113 , the general solution that is regular at large distances can be written as @xmath114 in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath115 .",
    "this expression is simpler , but equivalent to the one given in @xcite . from",
    ", one can calculate explicitly the normalization integral @xmath116 and its derivative .",
    "the short - range behavior of @xmath117 is known and if the ratio of the @xmath118 to @xmath119 coefficients is identified with @xmath13 , one recovers the formula given in @xcite .",
    "our prescription corresponds to an approximate , but accurate , solution to the matching equation .",
    "for instance , using @xmath120 as an additional potential , with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , one gets , using the same notation as above and @xmath123 for @xcite , @xmath124 clearly , the main discrepancy comes from reducing this short - range interaction to a zero - range ansatz .",
    "once this is accepted , our approximate treatment is nearly exact as compared to the precise matching of @xmath117 to the @xmath125 boundary condition .",
    "in this note , we have studied how the energy levels in a wide potential are modified by a short - range attraction of increasing strength , focusing on the case of @xmath11 space dimensions , as compared to the @xmath12 and @xmath14 situations .",
    "the energy shifts in a given external potential are well described by the following sl formulas , @xmath126 i.e. , a perfect fit is obtained if @xmath127 ( and @xmath3 for @xmath11 ) are treated as free parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath83 can be identified with the first non vanishing coefficient of the short - range expansion of the radial wave function and is thus proportional to @xmath128 , the wave function at the origin for the state in the external potential alone .",
    "the ratio is @xmath129 , the unit - sphere area in @xmath16 dimensions .    in the @xmath11 case which is our main concern ,",
    "a formula has been derived for @xmath3 , namely @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the coefficient of @xmath132 in the normalized wave function , assumed to be real and positive and to match @xmath83 at energy @xmath62 .",
    "this sl relation becomes more accurate when additional potential @xmath6 becomes more short - ranged .",
    "in particular , it improves significantly the simple prediction from first order perturbation theory in @xmath11 and @xmath14 .",
    "this study of exotic atoms is intimately linked to the statistical physics of bosons .",
    "the common tool is the _ pseudo - potential _ , which enables one to replace a finite ( but short ) range interaction by a contact interaction . deriving the pseudo - potential as a function of the scattering length for different values of the space dimension",
    "@xmath16 has been extensively discussed .",
    "the case of @xmath11 is notoriously delicate , see , e.g. , @xcite for recent contributions ."
