    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we shall describe the low - energy theorem , which we shall apply in sect .  3 to derive effective lagrangians for the @xmath40 and @xmath47 interactions to @xmath0 .",
    "in sect .  4 , we shall use these effective lagrangians to evaluate the @xmath0 correction to @xmath48 .",
    "we also present a master formula for @xmath48 , which includes all known corrections .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "low - energy theorems for higgs - boson interactions have been studied in great detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "these theorems relate the amplitudes of two processes which differ by the insertion of an external higgs - boson line carrying zero momentum .",
    "they provide a convenient tool for estimating the properties of a higgs boson that is light as compared to the loop particles .",
    "for instance , they have been applied to derive low-@xmath5 effective lagrangians for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 interactions at one @xcite and two loops @xcite .",
    "these low - energy theorems may be derived by observing that the interactions of the higgs boson with the massive particles in the standard model emerge from their mass terms by substituting @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mass of the respective particle , @xmath7 is the higgs field , and @xmath53 is the higgs vacuum expectation value . on the other hand , a higgs boson with zero momentum",
    "is represented by a constant field , since @xmath54=0 $ ] , where @xmath55 is the four - momentum operator .",
    "this immediately implies that a zero - momentum higgs boson may be attached to an amplitude , @xmath56 , by carrying out the operation @xmath57 where @xmath58 runs over all massive particles involved in the transition @xmath59 .",
    "here it is understood that the differential operator does not act on the @xmath52 appearing in coupling constants , since this would generate tree - level four - point interactions involving one higgs - boson line , which are absent in the standard model .",
    "special care must be exercised when this low - energy theorem is to be applied beyond leading order .",
    "then it must be formulated for the bare quantities of the theory .",
    "the renormalization is performed after the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ let ] ) has been evaluated .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath0 non - universal correction to @xmath48 . prior to performing the actual calculation",
    ", we outline the core of the procedure .",
    "inspection of the one - loop weak correction to @xmath48 @xcite reveals that only diagrams involving virtual @xmath2 quarks and charged higgs - kibble ghosts , @xmath60 , and without direct @xmath61 coupling contribute to the @xmath42 term .",
    "moreover , the masses of the @xmath60 scalars may be put to zero . after factoring out the tree - level @xmath40 amplitude , also the @xmath3 quark may be treated as massless , so that the @xmath2 quark is the only massive particle left in the loops .",
    "the low - energy theorem ( [ let ] ) provides an alternative method of deriving the @xmath42 non - universal correction to the @xmath40 coupling , which requires only the computation of two - point functions .",
    "in fact , we just need to compute the @xmath3-quark self - energy amplitude induced by @xmath2 and @xmath60 in the same approximation as above [ see fig .  [ one](a ) ] . the desired result",
    "may then be extracted by differentiation with respect to the bare @xmath3- and @xmath2-quark masses and performing their renormalizations in the resulting expression .",
    "the @xmath3-quark wave - function renormalization cancels against the corresponding part of the @xmath40-vertex counterterm . by including also the @xmath42 universal correction , which originates in the renormalizations of the higgs - boson wave function and vacuum expectation value",
    ", we can formulate a low-@xmath5 effective lagrangian for the @xmath40 interaction valid to @xmath42 , where the @xmath2 quark is integrated out .",
    "these considerations remain valid when one gluon is attached to the quark line in all possible ways .",
    "since the gluon can occur as a virtual or a real particle , at first sight , it seems that one has to deal with both @xmath40 and @xmath47 effective lagrangians .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the @xmath47 coupling does not receive a contribution in @xmath42",
    ". this may be understood by observing that the one - loop @xmath62 vertex correction , from which the @xmath47 amplitude may be constructed by means of the low - energy theorem ( [ let ] ) , does not develop a term proportional to @xmath63 in the high-@xmath4 limit .",
    "the latter point may be inferred from the analogous calculation of the @xmath64 vertex at one loop @xcite .",
    "proceeding along the same lines as above and exploiting knowledge of the @xmath0 universal correction [ see eq .",
    "( [ dun ] ) ] , it is possible to extend the @xmath40 effective lagrangian to @xmath0 .    finally , we may embed this effective lagrangian in the usual qcd lagrangian involving five quark flavours and perform perturbation theory in @xmath65 . in the case of @xmath48",
    ", we shall then recover the known @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath17 corrections @xcite with the leading @xmath4-dependent terms being collected in an overall factor .",
    "apart from the advantage of being implemented conveniently , our result will resum automatically reducible higher - order terms . by including also the electromagnetic and remaining weak corrections ,",
    "we shall obtain the complete standard - model prediction .    in summary",
    ", our original problem reduces to the evaluation of the self - energy of an on - shell @xmath3 quark up to @xmath0 in the limit of vanishing @xmath3-quark and @xmath66-boson masses .",
    "the relevant one- and two - loop diagrams are depicted in figs .",
    "[ one](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . as usual",
    ", we shall use dimensional regularization with anticommuting @xmath67 .",
    "notice that we have not included the reducible two - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "[ one](b ) , since the one - loop gluon - exchange subdiagram vanishes , due to the absence of a mass scale to carry its dimension .",
    "these diagrams as well as real - gluon emission will come in at a later stage through the qcd corrections that are to be evaluated from the effective lagrangian keeping the @xmath3-quark mass finite . this will be done in the next section .",
    "the bare amplitude characterizing the propagation of an on - shell @xmath3 quark in the presence of quantum effects has the form @xmath68_{{\\hspace*{.5mm}\\slash\\hspace*{-1.7mm}}p = m_b^0},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 label the scalar , vector , and axial - vector components of the @xmath3-quark self - energy , respectively , and the superscript 0 marks bare quantities .",
    "using the dirac equation and putting @xmath72 in the loop amplitudes , this becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "evaluating the feynman diagrams in figs .",
    "[ one](a ) and ( b ) , we obtain the @xmath42 and @xmath0 terms of @xmath75 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the dimensionality of space - time , @xmath78 is the t  hooft mass , @xmath79 is euler s gamma function , and @xmath80 .",
    "we recall that the @xmath4-independent qcd corrections do not contribute to the effective lagrangian in the limit of vanishing @xmath3-quark mass .",
    "equation  ( [ let ] ) now tells us that @xmath81 thus , we evaluate @xmath82 treating @xmath83 as a constant , since it receives its two powers of @xmath84 from the @xmath85 and @xmath86 couplings .    next , we carry out the renormalization procedure . for this end",
    ", we substitute @xmath87 @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the on - shell mass and @xmath90 is the appropriately defined counterterm . for @xmath91",
    ", we have @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 which is correct through @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that @xmath94 is already finite in the physical limit , @xmath95 , as it must because it constitutes the first term in the series of leading high-@xmath4 non - universal corrections to the @xmath40 effective coupling .",
    "@xmath96 will become finite when we also renormalize the @xmath2-quark mass . to @xmath15",

    "( [ dnu ] ) is @xmath78 independent as it should , since we are working in the on - shell scheme .",

    "we recover the notion that , in electroweak physics , one - loop @xmath42 terms get screened by their qcd corrections . in the present case ,",
    "the screening effect is extraordinarily strong .",
    "in fact , for @xmath118  gev ( @xmath6 ) , the @xmath0 correction compensates 71% ( 75% ) of the @xmath42 term . here , we have employed @xmath119  gev @xcite and evaluated @xmath120 at renormalization scale @xmath121 . as a normalization point , we have used @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "however , we should bear in mind that the @xmath42 term is incidentally small due to the almost complete cancellation of the universal and non - universal contributions .",
    "the presence of large logarithmic terms like @xmath123 is , of course , detrimental for the speed of convergence of the qcd perturbation series .",

    "( [ kfa ] ) as @xmath131 $ ] , i.e. , the interference of the @xmath42 universal term and the @xmath15 term , @xmath132 , is missing in eq .",
    "( [ kfa ] ) .",
    "we computed the two - loop @xmath0 non - universal correction to @xmath48 , which arises from the @xmath40 vertex and the @xmath3-quark wave function , by means of a low - energy theorem .",
    "combining this result with the universal correction in the same order , which is due to the renormalizations of the higgs - boson wave function and vacuum expectation value and contributes to any higgs - boson decay to fermions or intermediate bosons , we obtained the full @xmath0 correction to @xmath48 .",
    "this correction screens the positive @xmath42 term by 71% to 75% for @xmath5 between 60  gev and @xmath6 . as a consequence ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath48 to the top quark , which , at one loop , is already seven times weaker than in the case of the other fermionic decay modes , is practically quenched .",
    "we presented a master formula for @xmath48 , which makes full use of the present knowledge of radiative corrections to this quantity .",
    "we conclude that the residual theoretical uncertainty due to unknown higher - order corrections is likely to be negligible as compared to the envisaged experimental error .",
