    "inclusive decays of heavy hadrons have two advantages from the theoretical point of view : first , bound - state effects related to the initial state can be accounted for in a systematic way using the heavy - quark expansion @xcite@xcite ; secondly , the fact that the final state consists of a sum over many hadronic channels eliminates bound - state effects related to the properties of individual hadrons .",
    "this last feature is based on the hypothesis of quark  hadron duality , i.e.  the assumption that cross sections and decay rates are calculable in qcd after an `` averaging '' procedure has been applied @xcite .",

    "the analogue of the vacuum insertion approximation in the case of baryons is the valence - quark assumption , in which the colour of the quark fields in the operators is identified with the colour of the quarks inside the baryon .",
    "since the colour wave - function for a baryon is totally antisymmetric , the matrix elements of @xmath105 and @xmath104 differ in this approximation only by a sign .",
    "hence , we define a parameter @xmath106 by @xmath107 with @xmath108 in the valence - quark approximation . for the baryon matrix element of @xmath105 itself ,",
    "our parametrization is guided by the quark model .",
    "we write @xmath109 where in the quark model @xmath110 is the ratio of the squares of the wave functions determining the probability to find a light quark at the location of the @xmath5 quark inside the @xmath3 baryon and the @xmath0 meson , i.e.  latexmath:[$r=|\\psi_{bq}^{\\lambda_b}(0)|^2/|\\psi_{b\\bar q}^{b}(0 )    @xmath3 and @xmath112 baryons are the same , the ratio @xmath110 can be estimated from the ratio of the spin splittings between @xmath112 and @xmath113 baryons and @xmath0 and @xmath114 mesons @xcite .",

    "since the parton - model result for the total decay width is @xmath121 , the characteristic scale of spectator contributions is @xmath122 .",
    "thus , it is natural that the lifetimes of different beauty hadrons differ by a few per cent .",
    "the precise value of the lifetime ratio crucially depends on the size of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "taking @xmath123  mev for the decay constant of the @xmath0 meson , i.e.  absorbing the uncertainty in this parameter into the definition of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , leads to @xcite @xmath124 the most striking feature of this result is that the coefficients of the colour - octet operators @xmath99 and @xmath100 are orders of magnitude larger than those of the colour - singlet operator @xmath103 . as a consequence , the vacuum insertion approximation , which was adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite to predict that @xmath117 is larger than unity by an amount of order 5% , can not be trusted . with @xmath86 of order @xmath125 , it is conceivable that the non - factorizable contributions dominate the result , and without a detailed calculation of the parameters @xmath86 no reliable prediction can be obtained .",
    "given our present ignorance about the true values of the hadronic matrix elements , we must conclude that even the sign of the sum of the spectator contributions can not be predicted .",
    "a lifetime ratio in the range @xmath126 could be easily accommodated by theory . in view of these considerations ,",
    "the experimental fact that the lifetime ratio turns out to be very close to unity is somewhat of a surprise .",
    "it implies a constraint on a certain combination of the colour - octet matrix elements , which reads @xmath127 .",
    "understanding the low experimental value of the lifetime ratio @xmath1 is one of the major problems in heavy - quark theory .",
    "we will now discuss the structure of spectator contributions to this ratio .",
    "it is important that the heavy - quark symmetry allows us to reduce the number of hadronic parameters contributing to the decay rate of the @xmath3 baryon from four to two , and that these parameters are almost certainly positive ( unless the quark model is completely misleading ) and enter the decay rate with the same sign .",
    "thus , unlike the meson case , the structure of the spectator contributions to the width of the @xmath3 baryon is rather simple , and at least the sign of the effects can be predicted reliably .",
    "it is useful to distinguish between the two cases where one does or does not allow spectator contributions to enhance the theoretical prediction for the semileptonic branching ratio of @xmath0 mesons . as we have shown in section  [ sec : bsl ] , the theoretical prediction for @xmath47 , which neglects spectator contributions , is slightly larger than the central experimental value .",
    "if spectator effects increased the prediction for @xmath47 further , this discrepancy could become uncomfortably large .    if we do not allow for an increase in the value of the semileptonic branching ratio , the explanation of the low value of @xmath1 must reside entirely in a low value of the @xmath3 lifetime ( rather than a large value of the @xmath0-meson lifetime ) .",
    "this can be seen by writing @xmath128^{1/2 } } \\nonumber\\\\     = { \\tau(\\lambda_b)\\over b_{\\rm sl}}\\,\\left (     { \\tau(b^-)\\over\\tau(b^0 ) } \\right)^{1/2}\\,\\gamma_{\\rm sl}(b ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the average semileptonic branching ratio of @xmath0 mesons , and @xmath129 is the semileptonic width . in the last step",
    "we have replaced the geometric mean @xmath130^{1/2}$ ] by the average @xmath0-meson lifetime , which because of isospin symmetry is correct to order @xmath131 in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "since there are no spectator contributions to the semileptonic rate @xmath129 , and since we do not allow an enhancement of the semileptonic branching ratio , in order to obtain a small value for @xmath1 we can increase the width of the @xmath3 baryon and/or decrease ( within the experimental errors ) the lifetime ratio @xmath117 . allowing for a downward fluctuation of this ratio by two standard deviations , i.e.  @xmath132 , and using the estimate of @xmath59 corrections in ( [ taucrude ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the spectator contribution to the width of the @xmath3 baryon .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath135 depend on the scale @xmath53 , at which the wilson coefficients @xmath55 are renormalized .",
    "we take into account the evolution of the operators between the scales @xmath53 and @xmath22 , so that the parameters defining the matrix elements of the four - quark operators are always renormalized at @xmath22 . ] for @xmath16 we find @xmath136 and @xmath137 , whereas for @xmath62 we obtain the larger values @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath110 and @xmath106 are of order unity , we find that the spectator contributions yield a reduction of the lifetime of the @xmath3 baryon by a few per cent , and that @xmath140 , in contrast with the experimental result .",
    "if we try to push the theoretical prediction by taking the large value @xmath141 ( corresponding to a violation of the valence - quark approximation by 50% ) and choosing a low scale @xmath62 , we have to require that @xmath142 with @xmath143 , 2.2 and 1.3 for @xmath144 , 0.83 and 0.88 ( corresponding to the central experimental value and the @xmath145 and @xmath146 fluctuations ) .",
    "hence , unless we allow for an upward fluctuation of the experimental result by two standard deviations , we need a value of @xmath110 that is significantly larger than the quark - model prediction in ( [ rval ] )",
    ". a reliable field - theoretic calculation of the parameters @xmath110 and @xmath106 is of great importance to support or rule out such a possibility .    on the other hand ,",
    "the low experimental value of the semileptonic branching ratio may find its explanation in a low renormalization scale ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : mudep ] and [ fig : bsl ] ) , or it may be caused by the effects of new physics , such as an enhanced rate for flavour - changing neutral currents of the type @xmath147 .",
    "hence , one may be misled in using the semileptonic branching ratio as a constraint on the size of spectator contributions .",
    "then there is the possibility to decrease the value of @xmath1 by increasing the lifetime of the @xmath148 meson , i.e.  in ( [ didef ] ) we can allow for spectator contributions to the width of the @xmath148 meson . at first sight , this seems to make it possible ( with a suitable choice of @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) to gain a contribution of about @xmath151 , which would take away much of the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",

    "[ fig : mudep ] and [ fig : bsl ] , this is still tolerable provided yet unknown higher - order corrections confirm the use of a low renormalization scale .",

    "we find that in @xmath0-meson decays the coefficients of the colour - octet non - factorizable operators are much larger than those of the colour - singlet factorizable operators , and therefore the contributions from the non - factorizable operators can not be neglected .",
