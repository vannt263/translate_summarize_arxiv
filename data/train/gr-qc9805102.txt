    "gravitational waves emitted by solar - mass - size compact bodies orbiting massive ( @xmath2 and greater ) black holes ( and spiralling towards them as they lose energy and angular momentum to the emitted radiation ) are a favoured source for gravitational wave detectors sensitive to low - frequency radiation , such as proposed space - based detectors like the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite . systems of this type lend themselves to theoretical analysis via perturbation theory , because of the extreme mass ratio between the two bodies . in recent years",
    ", the teukolsky perturbation formalism for black holes has been employed successfully to describe orbital decay of small bodies orbiting a large schwarzschild ( i.e. non - rotating ) black hole @xcite , using a mixture of analytic and numerical results ( for an informative overview of much of the purely analytic work to date , see mino et al .",
    "one result of this work has been to modify the long - standing result @xcite that , under radiation reaction , orbits tend to become more circular as they slowly decay",
    ". in fact , inside a critical radius , which is @xmath3 for nearly circular orbits in the schwarzschild geometry , non - circular orbits tend to become more , rather than less , eccentric @xcite .",
    "although a precisely circular orbit would remain circular inside the critical radius , its circularity is no longer stable to small perturbations away from precise circularity as the orbital decay continues .    despite their intrinsic interest , these results may prove of limited usefulness for any future low - frequency gravitational wave detectors , since there is no reason to expect that large black holes should typically have no spin at all .",
    "just the opposite ( that they should exhibit strong rotation ) is perhaps more to be expected @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of great interest to extend this type of analysis to the case of rotating , or kerr black holes .",
    "this presents no difficulty for the teukolsky perturbation formalism itself , which was developed for the kerr metric , but a problem does arise in dealing with an additional constant of the motion which governs orbits around spinning black holes . unlike the energy and angular momentum , whose flux can easily be determined from the waves far from the source , until very recently there was no clear understanding of how to calculate the amount of `` carter constant '' carried away by the emitted radiation . in spite of this , it has been shown recently , for general orbits in kerr , that circular orbits ( defined as orbits of constant boyer - lindquist radius , and sometimes referred to as `` quasi - circular '' ) remain circular under radiation reaction @xcite . while progress continues in developing techniques for dealing with general orbits in kerr @xcite , it now seems worthwhile to investigate the case of nearly - circular , equatorial orbits around rotating black holes @xcite .",
    "equatorial orbits in the kerr spacetime , like orbits in schwarzschild , can be said to have zero `` carter constant '' , which remains unchanged during orbital decay .",
    "looking at these orbits can tell us if the behaviour previously observed for slightly - eccentric orbits in schwarzschild is also seen in the kerr metric for all values of the kerr spin parameter @xmath4 .",
    "it is shown in this paper that , for equatorial orbits , it is generally true that a critical radius , @xmath0 exists beyond which slightly eccentric orbits become less circular due to radiation reaction , and that this radius is encountered close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "this is best illustrated by examining the behavior of the parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the orbital eccentricity , and @xmath7 the mean radius , and an overdot indicates differentiation by time .",
    "this parameter is negative for orbits evolving with increasing eccentricities , and positive for decreasing eccentricity . near the isco one can show , as in sec . 9 below , that @xmath8 diverges towards negative infinity near the isco , for nearly all values of @xmath9 .",
    "there is an apparent exception to this behaviour in the limiting case of a maximally rotating kerr black hole with @xmath10 . in that case , the horizon and the isco are both located at @xmath11 in boyer - lindquist co - ordinates , although they are still separate in terms of proper radial distance .",
    "as one approaches @xmath11 , for the case of a prograde orbit around an extreme kerr black hole , @xmath8 is both postive and finite , approaching the limit of @xmath12 at @xmath11 .",
    "not surprisingly therefore , for prograde orbits around black holes with very large @xmath13 , the transition to eccentricity - increasing inspiral takes place only shortly before the onset of dynamical instability at the isco in terms of the boyer - lindquist radial co - ordinate .",
    "the number of orbits remaining at this point is an order of magnitude fewer for such cases than it is for retrograde orbits in the same geometry .",
    "since the radius of the isco is much smaller for prograde than for retrograde orbits ( with @xmath14 , @xmath15 for prograde orbits and @xmath16 for retrograde orbits ) , the critical radius is also much smaller for prograde orbits .",
    "these results demonstrate that the onset of `` back reaction instability '' for circular orbits precedes , and is intimately connected with , the onset of dynamical instability signified by the isco .",
    "it seems reasonable to conjecture that the alteration in the shape of the radial protential as the isco approaches , at which point the minimum of the effective potential vanishes , is reponsible for the gain in eccentricity .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the orbital equations for geodesic motion ( i.e. not including radiation reaction ) are solved analytically for slightly eccentric , equatorial orbits . in section 3",
    "the tuekolsky perturbation formalism is described , and section 4 shows how to calculate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum carried away from the system using this formalism . in section 5 the sasaki - nakamura equation , which is actually solved rather than the tuekolsky radial equation for numerical reasons , is presented . in section 6 the teukolsky source function",
    "is calculated for a perturbing particle following the orbits of section 2 , and the results of both of these sections come together in section 7 to yield the rate of change of orbital eccentricity due to radiation damping .",
    "this orbital evolution is described under the assumption of adiabaticity ( that the orbital evolution is much slower than the orbital period ) , which introduces constraints which are discussed in section 8 . finally , in section 9 , the analytic and numerical results are presented , followed by a discussion of their significance in section 10 .",
    "a guide to the essential points of the argument is given at the end of section 7 .",
    "since the perturbation of the kerr metric producing the gravitational waves is that of a small particle orbiting the black hole , it will be necessary to solve the orbital equations for a particle in orbit around a rotating black hole .",
    "we require expressions for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 to describe the orbit in boyer - lindquist co - ordinates .",
    "since we restrict ourselves to equatorial orbits , the solution for the @xmath20 motion is trivial , @xmath21 is a constant throughout .",

    "these defining equations for @xmath7 and @xmath6 permit us to write the orbital energy and angular momentum in terms of these two quantities .",
    "since we assume throughout that @xmath6 is a small quantity , it is convenient to expand @xmath33 and @xmath34 in terms of it , @xmath38 using our two equations in @xmath7 and @xmath6 , it is easy to show that @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "once the inspiral proceeds on a timescale which is about as short as the time to complete an orbit , this approximation loses all validity . using eq .",
    "( [ rdot ] ) , we find that the adiabatic condition can be written , @xmath242 just as the inspiral timescale must be greater than an orbital period , so too must the circularization timescale @xmath243",
    ". however , this quantity is almost invariably less than the inspiral timescale , so eq .  ( [ ad ] ) is the key condition . for very large radii , in the newtonian limit , @xmath244 ( for a discussion of this limit see ref.@xcite ) and the condition is simply @xmath245 , which is very much less restrictive than the linear perturbation condition @xmath246 , upon which the teukolsky formalism rests . approaching the isco however , where the numerical results tell us that @xmath234 remains finite and of the same order as its newtonian value , we see that the adiabatic limit on @xmath247 is proportional to @xmath248 , which becomes vanishingly small as the isco nears .",
    "therefore , near the isco the adiabatic condition supercedes the linear perturbation condition , as the leading constraint on @xmath247 .",
    "only by imagining a test particle which has vanishingly small mass can we apply the results of our calculation all the way to the isco , but no doubt there exist real physical systems , with @xmath249 for instance , which are correctly described for almost all of the inspiral by this approximation ( recalling that our calculations presume that the particle is a point mass as a further simplification ) .",
    "this issue will be discussed more quantitatively in ref .",
    "with the results of section 7 , it only remains to calculate @xmath235 , @xmath129 [ eqs.([sola ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) ] and @xmath250 [ eq .  ( [ weyl ] ) ] numerically to find @xmath251 . to find the solutions to the radial equation [ eq .  ( [ tr ] ) ]",
    "one actually solves the sasaki - nakamura equation [ eq .",
    "( [ sn ] ) ] for @xmath252 and @xmath253 [ eqs .",
    "( [ ain ] ) and ( [ aoth ] ) ] .",
    "these solutions are very smooth , apart from a singularity at the horizon @xmath254 , and so bulirsch - stoer integration works very well in integrating them .",
    "the singularity is avoided by starting the integration from a point just outside the horizon ( typically at @xmath255 ) .",
    "the solutions are insensitive to variations by several orders of magnitude of this small increment .",
    "richardson polynomial extrapolation is used to evaluate @xmath253 as @xmath256 , since it can be expressed as the first term in a polynomial in @xmath257 defining the amplitude of the ingoing wave at large @xmath163 in eq .",
    "( [ ain ] ) @xcite .",
    "this amplitude is evaluated for several endpoints of integration , doubling the endpoint radius at each trial , allowing the extrapolator to evaluate the limit of the amplitude as @xmath132 , which is @xmath253 .",
    "the spheroidal harmonic functions are calculated by expressing them as a linear combination of spherical harmonics of equal @xmath258 , summed over all available values in @xmath259 ( truncating the series after 30 terms in practice ) .",
    "substituting this series into the second - order ode defining the spheroidal harmonics gives us a 5-term recurrence relation for the co - efficients of the expansion .",
    "this procedure , for the scalar case only , is found in @xcite .",
    "the recurrence relation for the expansion co - efficients can be solved using matrix eigenvalue routines which , like the bulirsch - stoer integrator and the polynomial extrapolator , are found in ref .",
    "the derivative of each spheroidal harmonic is also expressible as a combination of spherical harmonics of different spin - weight values by use of the edth operator @xcite .",
    "useful checks for the numerical results are found in the schwarzschild limit , in @xcite and in the circular limit , in @xcite .",
    "analytically the results of sections 2 and 7 reduce to those of @xcite in the schwarzschild limit and those of section 2 to the results of @xcite in the post - newtonian limit .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical results is limited by several factors .",
    "the relative accuracies of the bulirsch - stoer integrator and the richardson extrapolator can be increased easily , at some loss in computing speed . for these calculations",
    "they were set to @xmath260 and @xmath261 respectively .",
    "the solution of the eigenvalue problem has very good accuracy , but the approximation of the spheroidal harmonics as a combination of spherical harmonics begins to lose accuracy seriously when @xmath262 becomes much larger than order unity .",
    "however , this only occurs for very high ( @xmath263 ) harmonics of the motion for small radii , and these contributions are not required at the accuracy used here .",
    "the chief limit on accuracy is , in fact , the number of harmonics in @xmath259 and @xmath258 which are calculated .",
    "invariably , for small eccentricity orbits , the leading order contribution is for @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and the significance of the contribution decreases sharply ( but less so for small radii ) with increasing @xmath259 and @xmath258 .",
    "a simple estimate , used in ref.@xcite , enables one to reliably estimate the inaccuracy involved in truncating the calculation at @xmath266 .",
    "it tells us that , for a relative error ( in estimates of the loss of energy and angular momentum ) no greater than @xmath145 , with a mean orbital radius @xmath7 , then @xmath267 . taking all of these factors into account",
    ", we can generally estimate the accuracy of the numerical results at @xmath268 , and certainly the relative errors should be no greater than @xmath269 in the worst case .",
    "a useful parameter with which to investigate the orbital evolution is @xmath8 , which represents a ratio of the inspiral timescale to the circularization timescale , or @xmath270 again , @xmath8 is positive when radiation reaction circularizes the orbit , and negative when it drives the orbit more eccentric . in order to see",

    "( [ hv ] ) ] diverges , since @xmath273 . since the numerical results show that @xmath233 and @xmath234 remain finite in all cases , it is apparent that @xmath233 ( which is otherwise dominant ) , contributes negligibly near @xmath274 .",
    "therefore , making use of the expression for @xmath61 from eq .",
    "( [ rdot ] ) , we find for @xmath7 near @xmath274 , @xmath275 again , @xmath276 as @xmath277 , so @xmath8 diverges at the isco . however , its sign as this point approaches depends on the function @xmath278 [ eq .",
    "( [ calh ] ) ] , since the expressions in the denominator are all positive for @xmath279 .",
    "it is obvious that for large @xmath163 , @xmath278 is always positive , but for small values of @xmath163 , which can be achieved by prograde orbits around rapidly spinning black holes ( @xmath280 ) , @xmath278 can become negative .",
    "however , it always becomes positive again before the isco , so that @xmath281 at the isco , in all cases except one .",
    "the exceptional case is the extreme one of @xmath282 . at this unique point , @xmath278 , and all expressions in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) go to zero . setting @xmath283 in eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , and canceling factors of @xmath284 from both numerator and denominator , one finds that @xmath285 which is both positive and finite , in contrast to the usual behaviour as the isco approaches . as fig .",
    "1 shows , the curves describing the critical radius and the isco do approach each other in terms of the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate as @xmath282 , as our analysis of @xmath8 might suggest .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate the consequences of this for massive particles inspiraling around near extreme kerr black holes .",
    "a useful measure here is the number of orbits left in the inspiral once the particle reaches the critical radius , that is , the number of orbits it will take the particle to reach the isco . defining @xmath286 as the inspiral time between @xmath0 and @xmath274 , and referring to eq .",
    "( [ rdot ] ) for the rate of inspiral , we have @xmath287 to a rough approximation , we can take @xmath234 as constant in this region , and therefore @xmath288 approximately , the number of orbits left in this time will be @xmath289 note that @xmath290 , so that @xmath291 is inversely proportional to @xmath247 . in the test particle limit @xmath292 , @xmath293 .    for @xmath294 , we find that @xmath295 , while for @xmath296 , @xmath297 .",
    "note that the rate of energy loss is similar in these two cases ( retrograde orbits radiate more energy for an orbit of given radius than do prograde orbits ) , but the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath274 is much smaller in the latter case .",
    "the condition of eq .",
    "( [ ad ] ) at the critical radius for @xmath296 is @xmath298 , so these estimates are still applicable to systems with extreme mass ratios , such as compact solar - mass - size objects spiralling into rapidly rotating supermassive black holes .",
    "for such a system , a prograde orbit spends an order of magnitude or more fewer orbits in the eccentricity increasing phase than does a retrograde orbit .",
    "furthermore , the orbital periods for these two cases ( a prograde orbit with @xmath299 , and a retrograde orbit with @xmath300 ) are also very different , with the period of the retrograde orbit an order of magnitude longer .",
    "the retrograde orbit therefore spends a factor of hundreds more time gaining eccentricity than the prograde orbit .",
    "conversely , the prograde orbit spend much longer in the eccentricity decreasing phase .",
    "1 illustrates the positions of the horizon , isco and the critical radius for prograde and retrograde orbits around black holes of all spins .",
    "2 illustrates the behaviour of @xmath8 for schwarzschild orbits ( @xmath301 ) and for prograde and retrograde orbits around a kerr black hole with @xmath302 .",
    "the dramatic plunge in @xmath8 towards negative values as the isco approaches is seen in all three cases .    in order to calculate how the eccentricity changes as the orbit evolves",
    ", one can integrate eq .",
    "( [ cee ] ) and define a new parameter @xmath303 , such that @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the initial eccentricity at radius @xmath306 , and @xmath307 is the eccentricity at a smaller radius @xmath308 . employing the numerical results for @xmath8 , along with the analytic approximation close to the isco given in eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , we can numerically integrate this equation to derive @xmath303 .",
    "3 shows @xmath303 for the three cases of fig .",
    "2 , illustrating how the eccentricity changes as the orbit inspirals .",
    "one can see that , in the case of a black hole with spin parameter @xmath309 , a retrograde orbit ( @xmath310 ) will have an order - of - magnitude greater eccentricity ( relative to the eccentricity it had at @xmath311 ) when it reaches the critical radius ( the turning point on the curve ) then will a prograde orbit when it reaches its critical radius , much further in .",
    "the amount the eccentricity increases by after the critical radius is passed depends crucially on the details of the physical size and mass of the orbiting particle , which it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyse . for a test particle with vanishing @xmath247",
    "the eccentricity increases arbitrarily , but in a physical case this process will be cut off by the onset of dynamical instability at some point .",
    "the results of this paper broadly confirm the experience of the non - rotating case , in that radiation reaction tends to reduce orbital eccentricity until near the the isco , when the onset of dynamical instability is prefigured by a period of decircularization of the inspiralling orbit .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that this effect is induced by alterations in the shape of the radial potential @xmath312 as the isco approaches , since at the isco , the minimum which defines the particle s circular orbit disappears . beyond this point",
    "the particle can only plunge towards the central body and is not longer in a dynamically stable orbit .",
    "one can imagine that as this point approaches , the potential well in which the orbit sits becomes shallower and broader ( as it turns into a saddle point ) , so that the orbital eccentricity increases despite the circularizing force which drives the orbit towards the potential minimum .",
    "the tendancy of prograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes to begin increasing in eccentricity only very shortly before the plunge into the black hole ( at @xmath274 ) suggests that massive bodies in such orbits will have smaller eccentricities at the end of their inspiral than with bodies in retrograde orbits , or the non - rotating case . in the case of prograde orbits around an extreme kerr black hole",
    ", the fact that @xmath8 is positive arbitrarily close to @xmath11 , suggests that the critical radius has descended in the `` throat '' of the black hole along with the isco , a region where the boyer - lindquist co - ordinates become degenerate . since",
    "our notion of circularity is so dependant on this co - ordinate system , it is unclear whether we can attach any meaning to the critical radius for nearly circular orbits in this extreme context .",
    "nevertheless , from a practical point of view this critical radius continues to be distinguishable , in terms of the b - l radius , from the radius of the isco as we approach arbitrarily close to the case of extremal rotation , albeit that it approaches the latter more and more closely as the rotation increases ( for prograde orbits ) .",
    "it is worth empasizing that our definition of the eccentricity , although closely tied to a particular co - ordinate system , is nevertheless an important _ observable _ element of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the system , as seen above in eq .",
    "( [ edef2 ] ) .",
    "another effect of the back reaction force on the orbit is one which tends to alter the inclination angle , which measures the maximum departure of the orbit from the equatorial plane .",
    "ryan @xcite has shown that nearly equatorial prograde orbits tend to increase their inclination angle under radiation reaction , thus moving away from being equatorial , although the effect is not very pronounced .",
    "retrograde orbits , on the other hand , tend to decrease their inclination angle ( since the spin - orbit interaction is attractive for retrograde orbits ) .",
    "therefore , by the late stages of inspiral , one might not expect prograde orbits to have remained very close to the equatorial plane .",
    "this illustrates the need for a more general calculation of orbital evolution in the kerr geometry , which deals with the issue of the carter constant .",
