    "recently , @xmath2 mesons were observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "these particles have a special place in the doubly heavy meson family , because they consist of quarks of different flavors .",
    "the @xmath2 meson spectroscopy has the same features as the spectroscopies of charmonia and bottomonia , however the decay and production properties of @xmath2 mesons are unique .",
    "there is no annihilation channel for @xmath2 mesons into hadrons via the gluons and , consequently , the lifetime of the ground state of the @xmath3 system is large , given by @xmath4 ps @xcite .",
    "the main channel of @xmath2 meson decay occurs through the weak decays of the @xmath5-quark or the @xmath6-quark , which are respectively about 25% and 65% of the total decay width .",
    "the @xmath2 meson hadroproduction cross section is approximately 100 times smaller than the ( @xmath7)-pair production cross section , because the two pairs of the heavy quarks are produced in a parton subprocess .",
    "the mass spectrum and the decay properties of the @xmath2 mesons are studied in detail in the framework of potential quark models @xcite , in the qcd sum rules methods @xcite and in the ope approach @xcite .",
    "the predictions at leading order in @xmath8 for the @xmath2 meson production rates in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 interactions were obtained in the collinear parton model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 meson production cross section became large enough to study experimental ( @xmath12 nb ) only in the region of very high energy or in the region of very small @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the argument of the gluon distribution function in a proton ( the quark contribution to the hadronic production of @xmath2 mesons is very small ) . in this region",
    "the @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite is more adequate for describing the perturbative evolution of the gluon distribution function , which satisfies the bfkl @xcite or ccfm @xcite evolution equations , in comparison with the collinear parton model , which is based on the dglap equation @xcite .    in this latter",
    "we have calculated @xmath2 meson @xmath1-spectra at the energy range of the tevatron and the lhc colliders in the fragmentation model and in the framework of the @xmath0-factorization approach . in the fragmentation model",
    "we have taken into consideration only the main contribution originating from fragmentation of a b - quark into a @xmath2 meson @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite , which generalizes the collinear parton model to the region of small @xmath14 , the hadronic and partonic cross sections are related as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the unintegrated gluon distribution function in a proton ( unintegrated refers to the transverse momentum ) , @xmath17 is the virtuality of the initial reggeized gluon , @xmath18 is the 4-momentum of the initial gluon , @xmath19 is the transverse momentum of the initial gluon , @xmath20 is the angle between the gluon transverse momentum and the fixed axis @xmath21 in the plane @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in the numerical calculations",
    "we have used the following parameterizations for the unintegrated gluon distribution function in a proton : jb by blumlein @xcite , js by jung and salam @xcite and kmr by kimber , martin and ryskin @xcite .    to calculate the amplitude of partonic processes in the @xmath0-factorization",
    "approach the polarization vector for the reggeized gluon in the initial state is taken to be @xcite @xmath24 the squared amplitude for one of the processes in @xmath2 meson production in the @xmath0-factorization approach , namely @xmath25 was obtained earlier in @xcite . here",
    "we use our original results from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34  transverse momentum of anti - quark . since these are more suitable for numerical calculations .",
    "in those calculations , which were in the framework of the collinear parton model , we used the grv @xcite parameterization for the gluon distribution function .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath2 meson gluon - gluon production in the framework of the collinear parton model shows @xcite the dominant role of the fusion mechanism up to @xmath35 gev .",
    "it takes into account the total gauge invariant set of the diagrams which describes the parton process @xmath36 thus , the fragmentation approximation , incorporating factorization of the heavy quark production process and the soft process of a meson created in the final state , applies only at @xmath37 gev .",
    "of course , at the tevatron collider this region of @xmath1 is far from being available for experimental study .",
    "on the other hand , at the lhc collider the @xmath38 gev region will be under consideration .    in the fragmentation model ,",
    "the @xmath2 meson production cross section can be presented as follows : @xmath39 where the sum is taken over all the relevant partons @xmath40 , @xmath5 and @xmath41 ( but the main contribution comes from @xmath5-quark fragmentation ) .",
    "the fragmentation functions for the @xmath5-quark splitting into a vector @xmath42 and pseudoscalar @xmath2 meson at the starting scale of the perturbative qcd evolution were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the squared @xmath2 meson wave function at the origin , which can be calculated using the nonrelativistic potential quark model @xcite . in the numerical calculations",
    ", we used the result @xmath46 , where @xmath47 mev is the @xmath2 meson leptonic decay constant .",
    "the qcd evolution of the fragmentation functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are described by the dglap @xcite evolution equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the standard quark - quark splitting function .",
    "the results of our calculation for the @xmath1-spectra of the @xmath52 meson are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : tev_fr ] for the energy of the tevatron collider @xmath53 tev , and in the fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_fr ] for the energy of the lhc collider @xmath54 tev .",
    "the spectra that we obtain are compared with those obtained earlier in the collinear parton model via the fragmentation mechanism .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : tev_fr ] correspond to a choice of the parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath55 gev , @xmath56 gev , @xmath57 and @xmath58 mev .",

    "[ fig : lhc_fr ] were obtained using the set of parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath55 gev , @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 and @xmath61 mev .",
    "[ fig : tev_fr ] shows that our result obtained in the collinear parton model agrees well with the result obtained earlier in ref .",
    "the curves obtained in the @xmath0-factorization approach lie approximately 25 times higher than the collinear parton model prediction in the region @xmath62 gev .",
    "the maximum value of the @xmath2 meson production cross section is obtained using the js @xcite parameterization of the unintegrated gluon distribution function , and the minimum value is obtained using the jb @xcite parameterization .",
    "note that the slopes of the @xmath1-spectra obtained in the collinear parton model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach are equal , and the situation is the same as in the case of @xmath63 meson production in @xmath64 interactions @xcite .    at present , there is no experimental information on the @xmath1-spectra of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "it is known that the integrated production cross section in the region @xmath65 gev , @xmath66 and @xmath53 tev is given by @xmath67 nb @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the uncertainties in the calculations are about @xmath68% .",
    "this value depends on the choice of the masses , the @xmath8 constant and the leptonic decay constant @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , our calculations performed in the @xmath0-factorization approach show that the @xmath2 meson production cross section has a strong dependence on the choice of the unintegrated gluon distribution function  a variation by a factor of 2 was observed .",
    "the obtained values of the integrated @xmath2 and @xmath52 meson production cross section at the energies of the tevatron and the lhc colliders are presented in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "one can see that , with the fragmentation model , the results obtained in the collinear parton model are smaller to those obtained in the @xmath0-factorization approach . the theoretical predictions are shown together with their uncertainties , which are significantly larger in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the absolute value of the cross section obtained in the collinear parton model ( @xmath70 nb ) is much smaller than the cdf experimental data ( @xmath71 nb ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the prediction of the @xmath0-factorization approach agrees well with the data ( @xmath72 nb ) .",
    "taking into account the relative roles of the fusion and fragmentation mechanisms in @xmath2 meson hadroproduction , one can suppose that the cross section calculated in the fusion model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach will be more large than that obtained in the fragmentation model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath2 meson hadroproduction rates via the partonic subprocess ( [ eq : ggbcbc ] ) with the reggeized initial gluons will be presented in our forthcoming paper .",
