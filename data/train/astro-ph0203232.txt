    "in order to fit the impressive array of observational data now available , it is widely believed that a model of the universe should feature a period of inflation in its early history , leading to the generation of density perturbations via quantum fluctuations , and that the present expansion rate should be accelerating . while the latter phenomenon is often considered due to a cosmological constant",
    ", it is at least as attractive to presume that the acceleration is driven by the same mechanism usually exploited to give early universe inflation , namely domination by the potential energy of a scalar field .",
    "such models are known as quintessence models .",
    "an important class of quintessence models are known as tracking models @xcite , where the late - time evolution of the field has an attractor behaviour rendering it fairly independent of initial conditions .",
    "however , despite the existence of tracking behaviour the details of the initial conditions may yet be important .",
    "for example , in several models of quintessence the tracking solution can not be achieved too early ; big bang nucleosynthesis is spoiled if the quintessence field has too large a density at that time @xcite . more",
    "obviously , a quintessence scenario will not work unless the initial energy density is at least as large as is required by the present .",
    "it is therefore useful to have further guidance as to the likely initial conditions for quintessence .",
    "the simplest assumption concerning quintessence is that it is a fundamental scalar field ( rather than a low - energy composite field ) , and as such was already present during the inflationary epoch in the early universe .",
    "if the quintessence field is sufficiently weakly coupled that it is not affected by the inflaton decays ending inflation , its possible initial conditions are restricted by its dynamics during the inflationary period . note that we are not considering the situation where the quintessence field and the inflaton are the same field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a comprehensive study of the influence of inflationary dynamics on the quintessence field .",
    "we choose parameters so that the quintessence sector matches the observed acceleration of the universe , and the inflaton sector generates suitable perturbations to initiate structure formation .",
    "we investigate both classical and quantum dynamics of the quintessence .",
    "we assume a flat universe throughout .",
    "the quintessence model is defined by a scalar field @xmath1 evolving in a potential @xmath2 .",
    "constraints on such models from observation have recently been considered by various authors @xcite ; the precise details are not important for our considerations but for definiteness we use the results of bean et al .",
    "@xcite , who recently combined constraints on such models from type ia supernovae , cmb peak positions and large - scale structure surveys .",
    "they found one - sigma constraints on the quintessence density parameter and its pressure  density ratio of @xmath3 with this , and assuming the hubble constant to be given by @xmath4 @xcite , it is possible to find constraints on the parameters of the quintessence models . to locate viable regions of parameter space , we approximate these three constraints as gaussian distributed ( in the case of @xmath5 a half - gaussian centred at @xmath6 ) and independent .",
    "this defines a confidence region in the space of parameters , and using numerical simulations we can translate the confidence region into other variables such as the density of non - relativistic matter today and the parameters of the quintessence potential .",
    "our main discussion will focus on quintessence models with inverse power - law potentials , as originally introduced by ratra and peebles @xcite @xmath7 in order to simplify some later expressions we define the notation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is any field or variable . using the procedure described above and projecting the result onto the @xmath10@xmath11 plane gives the allowed region shown in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath12 and @xmath13 at 68% confidence , with a broader region at 95% confidence . in defining our models ,",
    "we allow @xmath10 to vary and for each choice fix @xmath11 at its best - fit value .",
    "we take inflation to be driven by a scalar field @xmath14 ( the inflaton ) in a potential @xmath15 .",
    "because of the small value of @xmath11 , the inflaton dominates the evolution and therefore we can use the standard constraints on its parameters . the inflation model is to be chosen so as to reproduce the amplitude of perturbations needed to generate the observed structures , which requires @xcite @xmath16 this is to be evaluated at @xmath17 , the value of the field corresponding to the epoch when the scale of the observable universe crossed the horizon",
    ".    in this paper we will consider potentials where inflation ends by violation of the slow - roll conditions , so the slow - roll approximation @xmath18 gives the end of inflation and the number of @xmath19-foldings @xmath20 gives us @xmath17 .",
    "fifty or so @xmath19-foldings is the minimum amount of inflation capable of giving our observed universe , but crucial for the considerations of this paper is that typically one expects enormously more inflation .",
    "if one only imposes the constraint that the initial energy density be below the planck energy , most models allow very large amounts of inflation .",
    "however the early stages of such inflation may be dominated by quantum dynamics ( the so - called stochastic inflation regime @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum value of the inflaton field we consider , @xmath21 , is given by the quantum - to - classical evolution transition @xmath22 where the @xmath23 represent the typical quantum and classical evolution per hubble time .",
    "for simplicity we focus on a inflaton model with a power - law potential @xmath24 the former constraints lead to @xmath25}{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\\\ \\tilde{\\phi}_\\mathrm{obs}&\\simeq &   \\sqrt{\\frac{50\\alpha}{4\\pi}+\\tilde{\\phi}_\\mathrm{end}^2}{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\\\ \\tilde{\\phi}_\\mathrm{max}&\\simeq & { \\left(}\\frac{3\\alpha^2{m_\\mathrm{pl}}^4}{128\\pi w_0}{\\right)}^{1/(\\alpha+2 ) } { \\,\\mathrm{,}}\\\\ w_0&\\simeq&\\frac{3\\times10^{-8}\\alpha^2{m_\\mathrm{pl}}^4}{512\\pi}\\ ,           \\tilde{\\phi}_\\mathrm{obs}^{-(\\alpha+2)}{\\,\\mathrm{.}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the models are now fully defined and we can study the dynamics of each field , beginning with the classical evolution .",
    "we assume that the quintessence field is completely uncoupled from everything else , including the inflaton .",
    "the equations of motion are the euler ",
    "lagrange equations for the inflaton and quintessence fields @xmath26 and the einstein equation @xmath27 { \\,\\mathrm{.}}\\ ] ] because of the very small value of @xmath11 , the evolution of the universe is determined by the inflaton .",
    "the quintessence field may dominate if its value is very small , but , as we will see this situation would end very quickly .",
    "therefore , using the slow - roll approximation we have the solution @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the subscript `` ini '' always means the value at some time @xmath30 . knowing the dynamics of the universe we can now study the quintessence field .",
    "the classical behaviour of the quintessence field is rather straightforward .",
    "if the field is in a region where @xmath31 is small , its classical evolution will be highly suppressed by the friction arising from the inflationary expansion and to a good approximation the field will retain its initial value .",
    "conversely , if @xmath31 is large , the field will quickly roll down until the potential becomes too flat .",
    "more precisely , using the slow - roll approximation for the quintessence field we have @xmath32 assuming @xmath33 constant ( roughly correct for a few hubble times ) the solution is @xmath34^{1/(\\beta+2)}{\\,\\mathrm{.}}\\ ] ] we define @xmath35^{1/(\\beta+2)}\\ ] ] and see that the evolution during a hubble time has the following approximate description : @xmath36 therefore , after a few hubble times the classical evolution of the quintessence field is to remain constant .",
    "although the large friction from the hubble expansion renders the classical evolution of the quintessence field negligible , the same is not necessarily true of the quantum fluctuations . indeed , as we shall see , the effect of these in the quintessence potential is to drive typical regions of the universe to quite large values of the quintessence field , corresponding to low energy densities .",
    "this possibility was first mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now recall briefly the way we treat these fluctuations .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the spatially - flat slicing and we split the quintessence field into an unperturbed part and a perturbation @xmath37 we quantize the perturbation and expand its fourier components @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the annihilation operator . in the linear approximation",
    "we have to solve @xmath40}w_k=0{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "if the field is effectively massless and @xmath42 is approximately constant , the power spectrum of the fluctuations is given by @xmath43}{\\left(}\\frac{h}{2\\pi}{\\right)}^2{\\,\\mathrm{.}}\\ ] ] this means that before horizon - crossing @xmath44 and afterwards it becomes constant . using @xmath45 and the fact that the fluctuations become classical after they cross the horizon , we find that the quintessence field receives quantum kicks whose size is estimated as @xmath46 per hubble time .",
    "the effect of these quantum fluctuations can be studied using the fokker ",
    "planck formalism @xcite , which allows one to follow the probability distribution @xmath47 of the quintessence field during inflation .",
    "a simple derivation is as follows .",
    "we take discrete steps @xmath48 during which there are a random jump of magnitude @xmath49 due to quantum fluctuations and a classical step @xmath50 , where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath1 . during this time an interval @xmath51 shrinks by a factor @xmath52 .",
    "we find the following equation : @xmath53\\\\ & \\times(1+\\varepsilon v^{\\prime\\prime}/3h^2)\\ , { \\mathrm{d}}q { \\,\\mathrm{.}}\\end{split}\\ ] ] subtracting @xmath54 , dividing by @xmath55 and taking the limit @xmath56 leads to @xmath57 on the right - hand side , the first term produces diffusion and the second one produces a drift .",
    "note that unlike the usual stochastic inflation situation , here @xmath33 is determined externally by the inflaton field evolution , and the fluctuations in @xmath1 do not back - react on the expansion rate .    to be complete",
    "we need the boundary condition @xmath58=0{\\,\\mathrm{,}}\\ ] ] the requirement that @xmath59 , and normalization @xmath60 which implies @xmath61 .    from now on we focus on the inverse power - law potential for the quintessence .",
    "first of all , one may wonder whether the massless condition we used for the typical quantum jump is justified .",
    "indeed , for values smaller than @xmath62 , where @xmath63^{1/(\\beta+2 ) } { \\,\\mathrm{,}}\\ ] ] the quintessence field has an effective mass @xmath64 which is no longer negligible compared to the hubble rate . , the value below which the classical evolution is important . ] for all wavelengths @xmath65 bigger than @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq ] ) implies @xmath67 and therefore the power spectrum of @xmath68 decreases as @xmath69 leading to a smaller value of the quantum jump after horizon - crossing .",
    "nevertheless , because the typical quantum jump @xmath46 ( typically @xmath70 ) is dramatically bigger than @xmath62 ( with @xmath71 , typically @xmath72 ) , the massless condition is broken only during very short periods of time ( much less than a hubble time ) and so the massless approximation is an excellent one .",
    "the fokker ",
    "planck equation becomes @xmath73 for @xmath74 we can drop the terms coming from the classical evolution since we have seen it is negligible . for @xmath75 the effect of",
    "the potential becomes important and it acts as a wall preventing the quantum fluctuations driving the quintessence field to the origin .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation we have to solve @xmath76 with the boundary condition @xmath77 ( no flux through the origin ) and maintaining @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this is equivalent to a random walk with a wall . starting with a ( half ) gaussian distribution centred on @xmath78 and with variance @xmath79 , and assuming @xmath33 is constant during @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 more precisely , the equation to solve is @xmath82 which has solution @xmath83 after enough time the evolution is roughly independent of the initial condition @xmath84 and we can set it to zero .",
    "we can now ask what one expects the mean value of the quintessence field to be in our region of the universe . because we are presently interested only in the mean value",
    ", we should only consider perturbations on scales larger than our present horizon , which are generated between the initial inflaton value @xmath85 and @xmath17 . because of the presence of the wall , the net effect of the quantum fluctuations is to diffuse the quintessence field to larger values .",
    "the extent of this diffusion depends on how much inflation occurs before the last fifty @xmath19-foldings ; if more inflation occurs then there are more ` steps ' in the diffusion and also the early steps are larger . we have also computed the distribution obtained by averaging over all possible initial inflaton values between @xmath17 and @xmath21 assuming a flat probability .",
    "actually we are more interested in the probability distribution @xmath86 of @xmath87 .",
    "we have @xmath88 which has a peak at @xmath89 . in fig .  [ q_obs ]",
    "we show some distributions @xmath90 in the particular case of @xmath91 ; we show the probability distributions for two possible initial conditions for the inflaton , and then the probability distribution averaged over a uniform initial distribution for @xmath85 between @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "[ peak ] shows the position of the peak in the distributions as a function of @xmath92 ; as we can see , the result is roughly independent of @xmath92 , and as expected the more inflation there is the further the distribution diffuses to large @xmath1 .",
    "we wish to know the quintessence value after inflation to assess when the solution begins tracking . in the slow - roll approximation ,",
    "the solution for the tracker is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the present value of the energy density and @xmath95 the pressure  density ratio of the dominant fluid ( either radiation or non - relativistic matter )",
    ". some examples of trackers are plotted in fig .  [ tracker ] .",
    "after inflation the quintessence field remains constant as long as its energy density is lower than the tracker s .",
    "we can therefore find the probability distribution @xmath96 for @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the redshift at which the quintessence reaches the tracking behaviour , by comparing the value of @xmath1 at the end of inflation with the tracking solution .",
    "using fig .",
    "[ peak ] and fig .  [ tracker ]",
    "we can estimate at which redshift the tracker is reached for some values of @xmath92 and @xmath10 .",
    "we notice that the smaller @xmath10 is , the later the tracker is reached for a given initial value of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ redshift ] we show some examples of distributions for the redshift at which tracking begins .",
    "the discontinuity in the distribution comes from the fact that at about radiation ",
    "matter equality there is a transition between two trackers .",
    "the striking feature of this figure is how low the expected redshift of tracking is .",
    "while some previous papers have advocated equipartition of the quintessence energy density as an initial condition @xcite , leading to prompt tracking , we find that tracking is postponed until the late stages , and in particular well after nucleosynthesis . indeed ,",
    "the bulk of the probability is not only after nucleosynthesis but after decoupling too ; however there is only a small probability that tracking has not begun by the present , which would not lead to acceptable quintessence .",
    "finally we must say that our results are valid for small initial values of the quintessence field before inflation ( in fact formally zero ) .",
    "if this were not the case , the probability distribution for the mean value of the quintessence field at the end of inflation will broaden to larger values and the tracker will be reached even later or not at all .",
    "we have analyzed the quantum dynamics of the quintessence field during a period of early universe inflation . due to quantum fluctuations ,",
    "even if the initial value of @xmath1 in a certain region of the universe is small , it is rapidly diffused to large field values and hence low energy density .",
    "we have found that typically tracking behaviour begins only at quite a late stage of evolution , well after nucleosynthesis and quite likely after decoupling too .",
    "although we have discussed specific models of both inflation and quintessence , we expect our results to be quite general ; as far as inflation is concerned we need only the assumption that there are significantly more than fifty @xmath19-foldings in total and a standard value of @xmath42 during inflation , while for other models of quintessence where the potential diverges at the origin the result should also be the same as the precise form of the potential is dynamically irrelevant . in particular , while we have only considered models where the tracking density during nucleosynthesis is negligible , these considerations may reinstate models whose tracking density would be unacceptable during nucleosynthesis .",
