    "idealized models of such physical phenomena are also useful conceptual tools for describing complex systems such as fluid turbulence , spin glasses @xcite , genetic populations @xcite , and random boolean networks @xcite .    in some cases , for example in polymer degradation , the evolution of a fragment depends only on its size .",
    "therefore , fragments do not interact and such processes are inherently _ linear_. in other cases including grinding processes , explosions in an enclosed volume , and breakup of eddies in a turbulent flow @xcite , interactions between fragments are essential .",
    "such fragmentation processes are intrinsically _ nonlinear _ @xcite . in this study , we show that the nature of the mass distribution changes qualitatively due to nonlinearities .    we investigate a basic class of nonlinear fragmentation processes where binary collisions are the cause of breakage .",
    "we show that such processes exhibit a shattering transition where infinitesimal fragments ( dust ) carry a finite fraction of the mass in the system .",
    "we consider the simplest realization where one of the two colliding fragments breaks into two pieces .",
    "generically , the number of fragments diverges in a finite time , indicating shattering into dust .",
    "the nature of the shattering transition depends sensitively upon the details of the fragmentation process , in particular , which of the two colliding particles splits .",
    "we investigate three possibilities : ( a ) either , ( b ) the larger , and ( c ) the smaller of the two particles breaks into two fragments upon collision . in the first two models , as the transition occurs the entire mass is instantly transformed into dust . in the third model ,",
    "the dust mass gradually increases once the shattering transition occurred .",
    "in contrast with linear fragmentation processes , explicit solutions of the nonlinear and non - local rate equations are generally not possible .",

    "the extremal one is selected and it characterizes typical and extremal behaviors of the mass distribution . in the case of model c , at the shattering transition , the mass distribution is algebraic for small masses , with a transcendental exponent . past the transition , the fragment mass distribution approaches a universal form .",
    "we first consider the number density that manifests the shattering transition ( section ii ) .",
    "then , we analyze the fragment mass distribution using rate equations for a deterministic version ( section iii ) and a stochastic version ( section iv ) of the fragmentation process .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and outline a few suggestions for future work ( section v ) .",
    "consider a fragmentation process where at each ( binary ) collision event , one particle splits into two pieces while the second particle remains intact . without loss of generality ,",
    "the collision rate is set to unity .",
    "analogous to the kinetic theory description of collisions in molecular gases , we assume perfect mixing , namely , absence of spatial correlations between fragments .",
    "the total fragment density , @xmath2 , evolves according to the rate equation @xmath3 without loss of generality , the initial density is set to unity , @xmath4 , and therefore , the total density is @xmath5 in a finite time , the number of fragments diverges and the average fragment mass vanishes .",
    "this divergence indicates that the system undergoes a shattering transition at @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the average number of collisions experienced by a fragment up to time @xmath8 .",

    ", we consider a deterministic rule where fragments split into two equal pieces . in the next section ,",
    "we show that stochastic rules result in qualitatively similar behaviors .",
    "we start with the case where a randomly selected particle splits upon collision ( this is equivalent to having both particles split ) . for simplicity , we focus on monodisperse initial conditions where all particles have unit mass , @xmath10",
