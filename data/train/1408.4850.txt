    "the same holds for the fluctuations of a tagged particle around the macroscopic shock position .",

    "@xcite we analyzed one situation where shocks occur with non - random initial condition . in that case , the shock width is of order @xmath18 and in that scale the fluctuations of a tagged particle has a law that is the maximum of two random variables , because the pieces of information coming from each of the two characteristics that meet at the shock are asymptotically independent .    in this paper",

    "we consider the following specialization of the model : @xmath33 as there are two jump rates involved , we call this model _ two - speed tasep_. further , we call particles with label @xmath34 _ @xmath1-particles _ and the ones with label @xmath35 are called _ normal particles_. we will be interested in the fluctuations of particle positions of normal particles which are around the shock created by the @xmath1-particles .",

    "we scale the jump rate of the @xmath1-particles critically , i.e. , we consider @xmath50 in view of the macroscopic description , particles with number given by is around the shock and its position is around @xmath51 . unlike in the macroscopic shock studied in  @xcite , where around the shock position particles are correlated over a @xmath18 scale , in the present situation particles",

    "as mentioned earlier , we let @xmath7 grow large so as to recover the macroscopic shock distribution , which for large but finite time @xmath15 would correspond to the choice @xmath121 . due to the numerical limitations discussed below",
    ", we will compute @xmath122 and its basic statistics up to @xmath123 .",
    "surprisingly , already for this relatively small value of @xmath7 , one is already quite close to the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the reason for this is the following . at first approximation , from the kpz scalings , we know that the randomness that influences the statistical properties of particle positions around the shock lives in a @xmath52 neighborhood of the characteristic lines that comes together at the shock ( for a proof in a special case , see  @xcite ) and the neighborhood should be quite tight to provide the super - exponential decay of the covariance for the airy@xmath67 process  @xcite .",
    "further , by a closer inspection near the end - points , we discover that at @xmath18 distance from the shock , the neighborhood is only of order @xmath18 as well  @xcite .",
    "these two phenomena imply that the convergence will happen on @xmath7 of order @xmath0 .",
    "the limitation to @xmath124 is due to the numerical difficulty of evaluating @xmath122 for @xmath7 large .",

    "more precisely , one has @xmath126 where @xmath127 , and , for @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "this implies that when @xmath7 increases , the ratio between the bounded terms and the large term becomes smaller than @xmath131 machine precision and no reliable numerical evaluation is possible . in our case , already for @xmath132 , @xmath125 ( much less @xmath122 ) can no longer be computed in matlab .",
    "for instance , matlab computes @xmath133 for all tested @xmath134 , @xmath135 with an error @xmath136 , whereas @xmath137 , with an error @xmath138 .",
    "we present the numerical computations until @xmath123 , since for higher values the error term in the kurtosis becomes visible .",
    "generally , the computational error of @xmath112 decreases as @xmath134 increases since then @xmath139 needs to be computed only for small entries and the evaluation of @xmath140 is easier ( namely , the matrix whose determinant approximates @xmath122 gets closer to the identity matrix as @xmath134 increases , see ( 4.3 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the statistics of @xmath122 were computed using the ` chebfun ` package ( see  @xcite ) , in which @xmath122 is represented by its polynomial interpolant in chebyshev points , for our choice in @xmath141 points .    in figure  [ figdistr ] we plot @xmath142 , @xmath112 for @xmath143 and the conjectured @xmath78 limit , namely @xmath144 .",
    "a property which is apparent from figure  [ figdistr ] is that @xmath140 monotonically decreases towards @xmath113 as @xmath7 grows .",
    "indeed , for all @xmath145 , and @xmath146 we have @xmath147 an analytic proof of this property does not seem to be trivial and is not available so far .    to further quantify the difference between @xmath148 and @xmath149 we computed @xmath150     defined by . on this limited interval width for @xmath7 the convergence of the difference of the distribution functions close to exponentially fast.,height=188 ]    and",
    "are compatible with the conjecture , but to have a further more reliable verification we study numerically the basis statistics too .",

    "in section  [ sectfinitekernel ] we derive the finite time kernel , whose fredholm determinant gives us the joint distributions of tasep particle positions , see proposition  [ fdetform ] .",

    "@xmath162 @xmath163 and @xmath164    the system with finitely many slow particles has been already partially studied in  @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the distribution function of particles positions is given by a fredholm determinant and the kernel was given .",
    "for a fixed @xmath165 , consider tasep with initial conditions and jump rates given by @xmath166 to distinguish this system with the one we want to study , i.e. , @xmath167 , we will index all quantities by a @xmath154 .",
    "proposition  6 of  @xcite tells us that @xmath168 where the kernel kernel @xmath169 has the decomposition @xmath170 here @xmath171 and @xmath172 are as in proposition  [ fdetform ] , while @xmath173 is given by @xmath174    first we note that @xmath175 this follows since @xmath176 for all @xmath177 and by the fact that in tasep the positions of the normal particles up to a fixed time @xmath15 depend only on finitely many other particles on the right with probability one , as is seen from a graphical construction of it .",
    "so it remains to show that the convergence in holds also on the level of fredholm determinants .",
    "first of all , as shown already in corollary  8 of  @xcite ) , it holds @xmath178 pointwise .",
    "the reason being that for any @xmath179 the pole at @xmath180 in vanishes , in the limit of large @xmath154 we can integrate out explicitly the simple pole at @xmath181 of the kernel @xmath173 and it results in the kernel @xmath182 given in proposition  [ fdetform ] .    to show the convergence of fredholm determinants we use their series expansion expression , namely @xmath183_{1\\leq k ,",

    "further , in the term @xmath190 , if @xmath191 is bounded from below , then for @xmath192 small enough this term is also zero .",
    "this implies that the @xmath193 determinant in is strictly equal to zero if @xmath194 . the physical reason for this",
    "is that if we consider the system with particle numbers bounded from above by @xmath195 , then by tasep dynamics particles can be present only in the region on the right of @xmath196 .",
