    "the term airborne wind energy ( awe ) refers to a class of wind power generators that exploit tethered aircrafts to convert wind energy into electricity @xcite .",
    "the benefits of awe systems , compared to traditional wind turbines , are essentially two : lower construction and installation costs and the possibility to reach higher altitudes , where faster and steadier winds blow .",
    "according to the current estimates the combination of these two benefits should render awe systems competitive with the established energy sources , including fossil fuels @xcite , in terms of both cost of energy and land occupation .",
    "the first papers and patents concerned with awe appeared in the late 1970s ( see e.g. @xcite ) , yet only in recent years a significant and growing research effort has been undertaken by both small companies and universities to develop such concepts via theoretical , numerical and experimental methods @xcite .",
    "awe is still in its infancy and no commercial system exists ; however , thanks to the continuous progresses that are being achieved , a relatively well - established set of few different approaches has emerged , while other , less promising ideas have been abandoned .",
    "today , awe systems can be classified by the way the lift force that keeps the aircraft airborne is generated  either aerodynamic lift @xcite , or aerostatic lift @xcite  and by the placement of the electrical generators - either on - board of the aircraft @xcite or on the ground @xcite . among the systems that exploit aerodynamic lift and ground - level generators , a further distinction can be made between concepts that rely on rigid wings @xcite , similar to gliders , and concepts that employ flexible wings , like power kites @xcite .",
    "small - scale prototypes ( 10 - 50 kw of rated power ) of all of the mentioned concepts have been realized and successfully tested to demonstrate their power generation functionalities .",
    "moreover , scientific contributions concerned with several different technical aspects , primarily aerodynamics @xcite and controls @xcite but also resource assessment @xcite , economics @xcite , prototype design @xcite and power conversion @xcite , have recently appeared , gradually improving and expanding our understanding of such systems .    despite the steady and promising development of the field ,",
    "the complexity and multidisciplinary nature of awe systems are such that several relevant aspects still need to be addressed in order to ultimately prove the technical and economic feasibility of the idea .",
    "one of such aspects is the take - off of the aircraft , particularly for concepts that employ rigid wings and ground - level generation .",
    "in fact , while systems with on - board generation @xcite , as well as kite - based systems with ground generation @xcite are able to take - off autonomously from a quite compact ground area , the same functionality for awe systems with rigid wings and ground - level generators has not been achieved yet .",
    "there is evidence of autonomous take - off of this class of generators @xcite ; however by using a winch launch that requires a significant space in all directions in order to adapt to the wind conditions during take - off . as a consequence",
    ", one of the main advantages of awe systems , i.e. the possibility of being installed in a large variety of locations at low costs , might be lost due to the need of a large area of land suitable for the take - off .",
    "so far , this issue has been addressed only to a limited extent within the scientific community . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a rotational take - off is studied and simulated ; however the focus is on the control and optimization aspects of this approach , rather than on its economic viability and the comparison with other possible methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analysis of several approaches is first carried out , considering different performance criteria , and three alternatives are deemed the most promising : buoyant systems , linear ground acceleration plus on - board propeller , and rotational take - off .",
    "then , the rotational take - off is examined in more detail by means of numerical simulations .    in order to contribute to address this important problem , we present here an analysis of three candidate approaches to realize the take - off of a rigid tethered aircraft with ground - based generation .",
    "this is the concept which is also pursued by the company ampyx power @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we compare a vertical lift approach with on - board vertical - axis propellers , a rotational take - off like the one considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and a linear take - off technique combined with on - board horizontal - axis propellers .",
    "the analysis is instrumental to carry out a comparison among the considered approaches , based on a series of performance criteria that we introduce in order to quantify their viability .",
    "the analysis and the subsequent comparison represent the first main contribution that the present paper adds to the existing scientific literature .",
    "then , we study in more depth the concept that is deemed the most viable one , i.e. the linear take - off maneuver combined with on - board propellers . in particular , we derive a dynamical model of the system that includes realistic aerodynamic coefficients , as well as friction and inertia , and we use it to refine the initial analysis in terms of power required for take - off .",
    "since the system is unstable in open - loop , we also develop the feedback control algorithms required to stabilize the take - off maneuver and carry out the numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ s : preliminaries ] provides more details on the considered type of awe system , which are needed to formulate the problem that we address in a rigorous way , and a brief description of the considered take - off approaches .",
    "the performance criteria are given in section [ s : preliminaries ] , too .",
    "section [ s : evaluation ] presents the analysis of the three take - off concepts using basic physical equations .",
    "the numerical simulation study is reported in section [ s : simulation ] .",
    "final conclusions are drawn in section [ s : conclusions ] together with a discussion of future developments of this research .",
    "we first describe the system under consideration and introduce the physical equations that link the main lumped design parameters to the generated mechanical power .",
    "these equations can be employed in a first - approximation dimensioning phase of the awe generator and are used here to compute one of our performance criteria . for the complete details and derivation of the equations recalled in the following , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the considered awe system is composed of a rigid aircraft , a ground unit ( gu ) , and a tether connecting them , as depicted in figure [ f : system_sketch ] .",
    "the aircraft is equipped with sensors , actuators and on - board intelligence to attain autonomous flight and realize the flight patterns required to generate power , as well as with communication capabilities to exchange information with the gu and possibly with other systems and infrastructure nearby .",
    "the gu consists of several subsystems , the main ones being a drum , around which the tether is coiled , an electric machine ( generator / motor ) , linked to the drum through a mechanical transmission system , and the power electronic system to control the generator and to convert mechanical power into electrical one and vice - versa .",
    "the described awe system generates energy by means of a cyclic operating principle composed essentially by four phases : the power generation ( or traction ) phase , the retraction phase , and two transition phases linking them , shown in figure [ f : system_sketch ] . during the traction phase",
    ", the on - board control system steers the aircraft into figure - of - eight patterns under crosswind conditions .",
    "the generated aerodynamic forces exert a large traction load on the line , which is reeled - out from the drum .",
    "the electric machine exerts a torque on the drum in order to achieve a desired reel - out speed and to produce power .",
    "in particular , an aircraft with effective area @xmath0 , aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , flying at a relative elevation @xmath3 and azimuth @xmath4 with respect to a wind flow of speed @xmath5 ( see figure [ f : system_sketch ] ) , exerts a traction load @xmath6 on the tether approximately equal to @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the continuous time variable , @xmath9 is the air density , @xmath10 is the equivalent drag coefficient ( taking into account the drag of both the aircraft and the line ) , @xmath11 is the length of the line , assumed straight , @xmath12 its diameter , @xmath13 its drag coefficient , and @xmath14 is the tether reeling speed . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the line is reeled out from the drum , hence effectively decreasing the apparent wind speed parallel to the tether direction , given by @xmath16 .",
    "the tether force @xmath17 multiplied with the reeling speed @xmath18 provides an estimate of the instantaneous mechanical power @xmath19 generated during the traction phase : @xmath20 the maximum generated power is achieved when the reeling speed is equal to 1/3 of the absolute wind speed projected along the line direction , i.e. @xmath21 , and ideally with @xmath22 . in this case , the obtained mechanical power is : @xmath23    for the sake of estimating the generated power , the mass of the airborne components is irrelevant as a first approximation , since the weight and apparent forces of the aircraft and of the line are significantly smaller than the force acting on the tether during the traction phase . on the other hand",
    ", this parameter clearly plays a crucial role when discussing take - off approaches . in order to evaluate a given take - off technique on a quantitative basis ,",
    "the total mass of the aircraft @xmath24 has to be linked to the system s capability in terms of force and power .",
    "such a link is given by the so - called wing loading @xmath25 , i.e. the ratio between @xmath24 and the effective aerodynamic area @xmath0 : @xmath26 the total mass of the aircraft is the sum of @xmath24 and of the additional mass @xmath27 required for the take - off capability .",
    "this will be discussed further in section [ performance_criteria ] .      here",
    ", we briefly describe the three take - off concepts under consideration .",
    "* vertical take - off with rotors*. in this approach , the aircraft is equipped with vertical - axis propellers which provide enough lift to take - off vertically . in the framework of ground - level generation , this approach is pursued by the company twingtec @xcite . in the awe field , the company makani power owned by google @xcite employs this approach for the take - off and landing their system with on - board power generation .    * rotational take - off*. this is the only proposal for rigid - wing systems which has been studied in the literature with numerical simulations in addition to static equations @xcite . in this approach , the hull of the aircraft",
    "is initially attached at the tip of a rotating arm .",
    "when the tangential speed of the arm is large enough , the aircraft takes off exploiting its aerodynamic lift and the tether is gradually extended out of the rotating arm until a certain altitude is reached .",
    "then , the rotating arm is gradually stopped while the aircraft transitions into power - generating mode .",
    "the company enerkite @xcite is implementing this concept for its awe system .",
    "* linear take - off with on - board propellers*. in this approach the aircraft is accelerated on a rectilinear path up to take - off speed by an external source of power , for example the winch itself or a linear motion system .",
    "horizontal - axis on - board propellers are then employed to sustain the forward speed during the climb to the operational altitude .",
    "this approach was briefly analyzed and deemed promising in ref .",
    "@xcite , but without carrying out a deeper analysis by means of e.g. numerical simulations .",
    "the company ampyx power @xcite pursues a similar take - off concept as the one discussed here .    in the remainder of this paper , we will use the subscripts @xmath28 respectively for the vertical , rotational and linear take - off approaches described above .",
    "a well - established metric to compare different electric power generation schemes on economic grounds is the levelized cost of electricity ( lcoe ) . in our case , additional components or land occupation required to implement",
    "the take - off approach will increase upfront costs ( and potentially maintenance costs ) and will lead to an increase in the lcoe of the awe system , as compared to the same system without the take - off functionality .",
    "hence , when comparing different take - off approaches , their impact on the lcoe should be assessed .",
    "however , the precise calculation of the lcoe is not feasible for new power generation concepts like awe systems .    rather than the lcoe , we will therefore consider a series of other quantitative and qualitative criteria which are easier to evaluate based on the existing know - how of awe generators , and which are related to the system s cost , complexity and required land occupation .",
    "if a specific take - off approach performs well according to these criteria , we can expect that the impact on the lcoe of the awe system will be small .",
    "the quantitative criteria are :    1 .   the additional power installed on - board and on the ground , relative to the peak mechanical power of the system , required to carry out the take - off procedure : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the peak ground and on - board power , respectively , and @xmath32 refers to the three considered take - off approaches .",
    "the higher the values of @xmath33 , the worse the approach .",
    "+ 2 .   the additional on - board mass , relative to the aircraft s mass without the system required for the take - off : @xmath34 although , as recalled in section [ ss : system_description ] ,",
    "the mass does not impact the maximum power generation in a first approximation , it is an important parameter for the controllability and maneuverability of the system and for its capability to operate in a wide range of wind conditions @xcite . again , the higher @xmath35 , the worse the approach .",
    "the ground area occupied by the take - off system , indicated with @xmath36 : @xmath37 the higher @xmath38 , the worse the approach .",
    "the qualitative criteria that we consider are :    1 .   the complexity and cost of the apparatus that needs to be added to the system for the take - off functionality .",
    "the capability to take - off under most wind conditions ( including no wind ) .",
    "the problem we will address in the next section is to carry out a comparison of the three considered approaches in light of criteria c1-c5 . in particular , we will derive equations that allow to compute the quantitative criteria c1-c3 , and we will assess the criteria c4-c5 on the basis of the knowledge on awe systems available in the literature and of our own hands - on experience .",
    "in the following three sections [ ss : rotorcraft ] , [ ss : rotational ] , and [ ss : linear ] , we will introduce the relevant assumptions and derive the governing equations of the considered take - off approaches .",
    "quantitative results and the related discussion will be presented in section [ ss : conclusion ] .      according to the actuator disk theory @xcite",
    ", the thrust through a disk with area @xmath39 is @xmath40 where the velocities are taken far in front and far behind the disk .",
    "the associated power is then @xmath41 in order to lift an object with vertical velocity @xmath42 and mass @xmath24 , the thrust must equal the weight , @xmath43 . by setting @xmath44 with @xmath42 being the desired climb velocity , considering a conversion efficiency @xmath45 between mechanical power at the shaft and fluid - dynamic power , and solving eqs .   and for @xmath46",
    ", it then follows that the required take - off power is @xmath47    in our assessment , for the sake of computing @xmath46 , we will consider a wing with wingspan @xmath48 and aspect ratio ( i.e. wingspan divided by the chord ) @xmath49 , and we will assume that the aircraft employs two propellers with a diameter equal to the chord length , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 . with regard to the additional on - board mass @xmath53",
    ", this is given mainly by the onboard batteries and electric motors that drive the propellers .",
    "the required battery mass is calculated from the energy density of lithium - polymer batteries @xmath54 and the required power @xmath46 , target altitude @xmath55 and climb speed @xmath42 ( i.e. the climb duration is @xmath56 ) .",
    "the power density of an electric motor is indicated by @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting equation for the additional on - board mass is : @xmath58 we solve the system of eqs .   and to compute the required take - off power , in order to account also for the additional mass .",
    "finally , as regards the occupied ground area , we assume that the vertical take - off can be carried out with all possible angles between the wing and the nominal wind speed .",
    "hence , we have @xmath59      ]    a schematic arrangement of the rotational take - off is shown in figure  [ fig_rotstart ] : the hull of the aircraft is attached to the tip of a rotating arm with length @xmath60 via the tether . the two angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 describe the orientation of the tether , assumed straight , with respect to the arm .",
    "the combination of lift force and centrifugal force due to the rotation leads to a reel out of the tether and the rise of the plane .",
    "if we assume that the angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constant during the rotational take - off , the sum of all forces perpendicular to the tether must cancel each other . then , the required power to rotate the whole system ( neglecting the drag of the rotating arm ) is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the tether tension @xmath6 projected onto the plane of the rotating arm and perpendicular to it and @xmath65 is the angular velocity of the system .",
    "we consider a projection of figure  [ fig_rotstart ] onto the plane of the rotating arm , as depicted in figure  [ fig_rotstart1 ] .",
    "given @xmath66 and line length @xmath11 , we define the angle @xmath67 and the distance @xmath68 as : @xmath69 @xmath70 then , assuming that the absolute wind speed is zero , the aircraft will develop a lift force @xmath71 and a drag force @xmath72 whose magnitudes are equal to @xmath73 figure  [ fig_rotstart1 ] also shows the projections of all the considered forces ( lift , drag , and centrifugal force ) onto the plane of the rotating arm .",
    "the components perpendicular to the tether are the ones parallel to the dot - dashed line in the figure .",
    "the requirement that they cancel each other yields @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the roll angle of the aircraft , as shown in figure  [ fig_rotstart2 ] which is the projection of figure  [ fig_rotstart ] onto the plane perpendicular to that of the rotating arm and containing the tether .",
    "again , the forces perpendicular to the tether are the ones parallel to the dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig_rotstart2 ] .",
    "thus , the following condition must hold at the equilibrium , too : @xmath76 finally , the tether tension in eq .   is @xmath77\\cdot\\cos{(\\gamma_v ) }      \\end{split}\\ ] ]    eqs .",
    "- can be used to derive the power and ground area required for the rotational take - off . since there exist many potential solutions that satisfy the equilibrium constraints - , we choose to evaluate this take - off approach by means of numerical optimization .",
    "we compute the involved variables ( i.e. @xmath78 etc . ) and minimize the required mechanical power installed on the ground , @xmath79 , under certain operational constraints .",
    "more specifically , we fix the value of the arm length @xmath60 and , for each pair @xmath80 , we solve the following nonlinear program :    [ e : rot_opt_prob ] @xmath81    where the constraint is used to guarantee that the roll angle of the aircraft is such that the inner wing does not get too close to the tether , which might lead to entanglement and subsequent crash . then , for each considered arm length @xmath60 , we compute the peak required power as @xmath82}\\;\\max\\limits_{l\\in[0,\\,\\overline{l}]}p^*_{g,2}(l,\\gamma_v , r).\\ ] ] the intervals @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 $ ] considered in eq .   cover the range of reasonable equilibrium configurations that can occur when setting a constant vertical inclination @xmath85 and reeling out the line . in particular , we assume that the line is reeled - out at a constant speed @xmath86 , and that a specified vertical velocity @xmath87 of the aircraft is achieved",
    ". then , from geometrical considerations we have that a minimum angle @xmath88 shall be achieved .",
    "the rationale behind problems - is the following : for a given arm length @xmath60 , we fix the vertical inclination of the line @xmath85 during the ascend and we compute the required peak power over a reasonable range of line length values .",
    "then , we search for the vertical inclination that achieves the lowest peak power . in this way , we obtain the minimal peak power , @xmath89 , achievable with the considered arm length @xmath60 and the strategy of ascending with constant vertical inclination . finally , we repeat this procedure over a range of arm lengths @xmath90 $ ] in order to find the minimal peak power @xmath79 required to compute our quantitative criterium * c1 * : @xmath91}\\overline{p}^*_{g,2}(r).\\ ] ] regarding the required peak onboard power @xmath92 and additional mass @xmath93 , both these quantities are virtually zero in this approach . finally , the required ground area @xmath94 is equal to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the argument that minimizes .      in the following discussion of the linear",
    "take - off , we first analyze the on - ground acceleration phase and then the climbing phase .",
    "the acceleration phase on the ground lasts until the take - off speed @xmath97 is reached : @xmath98 computed by setting @xmath99 and using @xmath100 . assuming that this speed shall be reached after a horizontal acceleration distance @xmath101 , the required acceleration is @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding required force is then @xmath103 .",
    "the other forces acting at take - off are significantly smaller , but not negligible , namely the drag force @xmath104 and the viscous resistance @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the viscous friction coefficient of the system employed for the linear acceleration .",
    "hence , the required maximal power on the ground is @xmath107 as regards the land occupation , we choose to fix the travel length , such that it is independent from the wing size , and we assume that the system shall be able to adapt to the widest possible range of prevalent wind conditions , i.e. the linear acceleration phase can be carried out in all directions . at the same time , like the vertical take - off the area spanned by the wings throughout the ground launching phase is considered to be occupied by the system .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath108       ( assuming no wind ) and a vertical speed of @xmath109 .",
    "the lift force has a component opposite to the thrust and the drag force has a component which adds to the gravitational pull .",
    "[ fig_linstart],width=302 ]    it is rather complicated for an external device like the winch to power the plane during the ascend . indeed , on - board propellers are preferable because they can be small , since they do not have to accelerate the plane any further , and they shall just balance the aerodynamic drag and part of the lift depending on the climbing angle . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the climbing phase assuming the worst conditions possible , i.e. with zero prevalent wind speed , which yields the peak on - board power . in the presence of wind",
    ", the climb may be carried out upwind with correspondingly lower power .",
    "we denote the vertical climb velocity with @xmath42 again , see figure  [ fig_linstart ] . at the same time",
    ", the airplane moves horizontally with the speed @xmath110 so that the total speed relative to the air is @xmath111 with the climb ratio @xmath112 . from figure  [ fig_linstart ] , it follows that @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the vertical component of the lift force must counteract the gravitational pull and the vertical component of the drag force in order to yield a constant climb rate ; i.e. the vertical equilibrium condition is @xmath115 .",
    "this gives @xmath116    for horizontal propulsion the required thrust is equal to the sum of the horizontal components of the lift and drag force , i.e. @xmath117    considering that the climb ratio is typically of the order of 0.1 - 0.2 and that the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft is of the order of 10 - 20 , we assume that @xmath118 and obtain from eqs .   and the final expression for the required thrust : @xmath119    the required horizontal ( forward ) velocity can be calculated from .",
    "thus , for a desired climb rate @xmath120 , both force and horizontal velocity can be computed using eqs .   and .",
    "similarly to what discussed for the vertical take - off , the corresponding required peak power @xmath121 for the propellers is then given by : @xmath122 for the propeller area @xmath39 , we consider two propellers ( this time with horizontal axis ) with a diameter of half the chord and an efficiency of @xmath123 .    finally , as regards the additional on - board mass @xmath124 , similarly to the vertical take - off we consider the energy density of on - board batteries and electric motors ( see ) and solve the resulting system of equations to obtain consistent values of @xmath125 and @xmath124 .",
    "in this section , we apply the results presented so far to evaluate the criteria * c1 * -*c3*. in particular , we consider three different wing sizes and corresponding design parameters as shown in table  [ wing_sizes ] .",
    "the obtained results are used , together with the qualitative criteria * c4 * -*c5 * , to discuss the considered take - off approaches and draw conclusions on their viability . for the computation of * c1 * , the mechanical power @xmath126 is calculated with eq .   with a wind speed @xmath127 m/s .",

    "the required ground area turns out to be the smallest among the three approaches .",
    "the additional complexity ( criterium * c4 * ) can be substantial , since the aircraft and on - board equipment have to be designed to sustain the large accelerations experienced during crosswind flight , and since large electric on - board power is required .",
    "this might require a completely new design of the wing .",
    "the additional mass also leads to a larger cut - in speed for the generator , since a larger wind speed will be required for the system to be able to remain airborne during power generation .",
    "moreover , in a deeper analysis the presence of the propellers will have a detrimental influence on the aerodynamics , hence either requiring a larger wing for the same power , or giving lower power for the same size .",
    "these aspects lead in turn to a reduced capacity factor .",
    "the possibility to take - off in a large range of wind conditions ( criterium * c5 * ) is in principle given , although more detailed studies should be carried out to assess whether the control surfaces and the propellers can effectively stabilize the aircraft during the ascend with relatively strong wind .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ t : sim_results ] shows a comparison between the power figures obtained from the simplified analysis of section [ s : evaluation ] and those obtained with the simulations .",
    "the values of power required on the ground are very well matching , hence confirming the outcome of our simplified analysis .",
    "the larger simulated values for the required on - board power , with respect to the simplified analysis , are due to the inertia of the aircraft , which plays a role in the transient from zero vertical speed to the target one ( see figure [ f : torque_force ] ) , and due to its pitch , which has the effect of decreasing the thrust in horizontal direction and adding a braking contribution from the lift force projected onto the @xmath151axis .",
    "again , notwithstanding these effects , the on - board power required for the ascend appears to be a reasonable fraction of the system s power .",
    "moreover , we did not carry out any optimization neither of the design parameters nor of the controllers , which can still be adjusted in order to achieve different tradeoffs between peak power consumption and velocity of the transient from zero to the target vertical speed .",
    "we presented an analysis of different concepts for the take - off phase of awe systems based on rigid wings and ground - level power conversion , by means of basic equations .",
    "based on the analysis , we concluded that a linear take - off maneuver with a ground acceleration phase and on - board propellers is the most viable approach .",
    "we refined the analysis of this maneuver by means of numerical simulations with a hybrid dynamical model .",
    "the simulation results predict slightly larger on - board power values than the simplified analysis , but still they are small compared to the total power of the generator .",
    "this indicates that the take - off equipment constitutes a rather small cost fraction of the total system costs . at the same time",
    ", the required land occupation appears to be reasonable .",
    "these outcomes confirm the technical and economic feasibility of this take - off technique .",
    "further studies will be devoted to a deeper analysis of the approach and to the study of the landing maneuver , both with finer dynamical models , also accounting also for wind turbulence , and with experimental activities .                      a.  bormann , m.  ranneberg , p.  kvesdi , c.  gebhardt , and s.  skutnik . , chapter 24 .",
