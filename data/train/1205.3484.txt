    "quantum field theory on curved spacetimes has gone through major developments in the last decades .",
    "explicit models have been constructed in this framework , including the scalar field @xcite , the dirac field @xcite and the proca field @xcite .",
    "these examples have later been recast into a general approach to the quantization of bosonic and fermionic matter field theories on curved spacetimes @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "examples of theories exhibiting a local gauge invariance have been investigated in detail , including the maxwell field @xcite and linearised general relativity on einstein manifolds @xcite .",
    "the quantization of gauge field theories bears new complications , which are not present for matter field theories .",
    "in particular , the equation of motion in a gauge field theory is not hyperbolic and thus one does not have a well - defined cauchy problem or green s operators , which are the basic structures entering the construction of matter quantum field theories .",
    "this problem has been resolved in the examples mentioned above by considering only the gauge invariant content of such a theory , i.e.  gauge invariant observables , and making use of a special gauge fixing condition .",
    "we emphasise that even though a gauge fixing is used in this construction , the resulting algebra of observables is by definition gauge invariant .",
    "the algebra of gauge invariant observables of a gauge field theory can have new features compared to matter field theories . as it has been shown in @xcite",
    "( see also section [ sec : algebra ] in the present paper ) the algebra of observables of a bosonic matter quantum field theory never has a non - trivial centre . in gauge field theories",
    "this can in general only be guaranteed under additional assumptions on the cauchy surface in the spacetime , see @xcite for the maxwell field and @xcite for linearised general relativity on einstein manifolds .",
    "there are examples of cauchy surfaces such that the algebra of gauge invariant observables of the maxwell field has a non - trivial centre @xcite . due to the theory of degenerate weyl algebras @xcite these centres",
    "do not pose mathematical problems for the quantum field theory on an individual spacetime , but they have impact on whether or not the theory is locally covariant in the sense of @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the centres are certainly of physical interest and should be understood in detail .",
    "we also want to mention that in addition to these results on linear quantum gauge field theories there has been a lot of effort in constructing perturbatively interacting quantum gauge field theories on curved spacetimes , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . in our work",
    "we restrict ourselves to linear quantum field theories , since as it will become clear later , there are a lot of non - trivial aspects which have to be understood in detail even at the linear level .",
    "this is in particular the case for fermionic gauge field theories .",
    "the restriction to linear theories will allow us to quantize gauge fields without introducing auxiliary fields as it happens in the brst / bv - formalism , cf .",
    "@xcite . however , we presume that our construction for the bosonic case yields a gauge invariant algebra of quantum observables which is isomorphic to the one obtained in @xcite at lowest order in perturbation theory",
    ".    the goal of the present paper is twofold : first , we aim at developing a general framework for the quantization of linear gauge field theories .",
    "this can be seen as an extension of @xcite to field theories subject to a local gauge invariance .",
    "we allow for bosonic as well as fermionic theories and provide an axiomatic definition of a classical linear gauge field theory in terms of fibre bundles and differential operators thereon .",
    "our setting is general enough to cover the matter field theories of @xcite , which will be promoted to gauge field theories with a trivial gauge structure , as well as the standard examples such as linearised yang - mills theory and linearised general relativity on einstein manifolds .",
    "even more , our general framework is sufficiently flexible to include examples of fermionic gauge field theories .",
    "the prime example of such a theory is the gravitino field ( also called rarita - schwinger field ) in linearised pure @xmath1 supergravity , which we will discuss in detail .",
    "a further example which we will study in detail is a fermionic version of linearised yang - mills theory , which emerges for example as the fermionic sector of a yang - mills theory modeled on a lie supergroup .",
    "bosonic gauge field theories can always be quantized in terms of ( possibly degenerate ) weyl algebras , while fermionic gauge field theories bear additional complications , similar to their matter field theory counterparts @xcite .",
    "the issue there is that the inner product space associated to a fermionic matter or gauge field theory is in general indefinite , and one therefore encounters physical as well as mathematical problems .",
    "the mathematical issue is that such indefinite inner product spaces can not be quantized with the usual car - representation .",
    "the physical problem is that , even if there would exist a suitable car - algebra , there are negative norm states in any representation of it .",
    "in contrast to other approaches to the quantization of gauge field theories which are based on kinematical ( i.e.  still containing gauge degrees of freedom ) representation spaces , our negative norm states would be states in the physical ( i.e.  gauge invariant ) hilbert space and would thus pose problems for the physical interpretation of the fermionic gauge field theory under consideration .",
    "this brings us to the second goal of this paper , which is the investigation under which conditions the two examples of fermionic gauge field theories give rise to positive definite inner product spaces and thus can be consistently quantized in terms of a car - representation .",
    "we prove that the fermionic generalisation of linearised yang - mills theory always leads to an indefinite inner product space and thus can not be quantized on any spacetime .",
    "this implies that the perturbative quantization of yang - mills theories based on lie supergroups is , in the above mentioned sense , inconsistent and puts strong mathematical constraints on such theories . on the other hand , our result is well in line with the spin - statistics theorem .",
    "the situation is better for the gravitino field of linearised pure supergravity .",
    "we provide a sufficient condition for this theory to give rise to a positive inner product space , which demands the existence of a special type of gauge transformation . for compact cauchy surfaces",
    "this condition is fulfilled if the induced ( riemannian ) dirac operator on the cauchy surface has a trivial kernel .",
    "we also consider certain non - compact cauchy surfaces and answer the question of positivity affirmatively .",
    "this shows that , under assumptions on the cauchy surface , treating the rarita - schwinger field as a fermionic gauge field theory ( as it is required by supergravity ) improves on well - known issues appearing in the quantization of the rarita - schwinger field when treated as a matter field theory , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "introducing a mass term for the gravitino field in a gauge - invariant way requires the coupling of matter fields to the supergravity and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we also provide an example of a supergravity background on which the rarita - schwinger gauge field can not be consistently quantized via a car - representation . considering the spacetime @xmath2  with @xmath3 denoting the @xmath4-torus  equipped with the flat lorentzian metric , we show that in case of the trivial spin structure the inner product is indefinite , while for all other spin structures it is positive definite .",
    "a complete classification of cauchy surfaces and induced metrics thereon which lead to a positive inner product for the rarita - schwinger gauge field seems to be very complicated and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : notation ] we review some basic aspects of lorentzian geometry and differential operators on vector bundles following mainly the presentation in @xcite .",
    "we then introduce our definition of classical gauge field theories in section [ sec : class ] and show that the basic examples studied in the literature fit into this framework .",
    "we conclude this section with a theorem on properties of classical gauge field theories , which generalises the properties found in the explicit examples to the axiomatic level . in section [ sec : algebra ] we study the quantization of gauge field theories and in particular propose suitable algebras of gauge invariant observables .",
    "the question of non - degeneracy ( positivity ) of bosonic ( fermionic ) gauge field theories is investigated in section [ sec : degeneracy ] .",
    "the rarita - schwinger gauge field is discussed separately in section [ sec : degeneracyrarita ] .",
    "appendix [ app : conventions ] contains our spinor conventions .",
    "we fix our notations and review briefly some aspects of lorentzian manifolds and differential operators on vector bundles .",
    "we mainly follow @xcite and refer to these works for more details and references to other literature .    a _ lorentzian manifold _",
