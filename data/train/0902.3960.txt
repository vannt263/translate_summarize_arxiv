    "characterising the mass spectrum of neutron stars ( ns ) is critical to the understanding of the equation of state ( eos ) which describes degenerate nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with ns primaries offer a promising means for increasing the number of such mass estimates , and better constraining the ns eos .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that some neutron stars could accrete up to 0.7  m@xmath3 over the course of the binary lifetimes .",
    "the detection of such massive neutron stars would significantly reduce the range of currently allowable ns equations of state .",
    "lmxbs themselves are sub - divided into transient and persistent systems .",
    "persistent systems are those where the primary is continuously accreting at a significant fraction of the eddington limit , whereas in transient systems , occasional outbursts are separated by long periods of quiescence , generally explained by the disc instability model @xcite .    in quiescent transient systems ,",
    "the mass of the compact object can be constrained by dynamical studies if the secondary is bright enough .",
    "spectroscopic observations allow both the orbital period and the velocity of the secondary ( projected onto the line of sight ) to be determined , and these quantities are all that are required to calculate the mass function ( @xmath9 ) , a lower limit to the mass of the primary star .",
    "if the optical counterpart is sufficiently bright to allow higher resolution spectroscopy to be performed , the mass ratio can be estimated by measuring the rotational broadening of the absorption lines originating in the secondary star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , fitting of light curves can place constraints on the system s inclination , providing the final piece of information required to constrain the primary mass .",
    "however , in lmxbs where the optical light is dominated by the accretion disc , other techniques are required to find the system parameters .",
    "specifically , @xcite found that in the case of scorpius x-1 , the bowen blend emission ( a blend of n@xmath7iii and c@xmath7iii emission lines near @xmath84640 ) can be used to trace the motion of the secondary star .",
    "doppler tomography of bowen blend emission lines revealed a bright spot of emission , attributed to bowen emission from the irradiated surface of the secondary star .",
    "this technique has since been used to determine the secondary velocity in a number of other systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , although we note that no independent verification of @xmath5 has been obtained for any of these systems to date .",
    "cyg  x-2 is a persistent ns lmxb , discovered in 1965 @xcite , and is the second x - ray binary for which an optical counterpart ( v1341  cygni ) was found @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that cyg  x-2 is located at a distance of @xmath47  kpc and the high x - ray flux implies that it is accreting at close to the eddington limit .",
    "it is one of the few persistent systems where the secondary is visible , contributing 70% of the optical flux @xcite .",
    "although the spectral type is a9  iii @xcite , the mass of the secondary ( @xmath10 ) is @xmath40.6  m@xmath3 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) . from the radial velocity ( rv ) curve based on absorption line spectra from the stellar photosphere",
    ", @xcite established that @xmath11  d and @xmath12  km  s@xmath1 , yielding a value for the mass function of the ns in this system of @xmath13  m@xmath3 .",
    "they also measured the systemic velocity ( @xmath14 ) to be @xmath15  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "their estimate for the rotational broadening of the secondary star of @xmath16  km  s@xmath1 constrains the mass ratio , @xmath17 , to be @xmath18 . setting the lower limit of @xmath10 in line with the predictions of @xcite allowed @xcite to constrain the primary mass ( @xmath19 ) to be greater than 1.88  m@xmath3 , and the orbital inclination ( @xmath20 ) to be less than 61@xmath21 , with 95% confidence .",
    "the existence of such a massive ns suggests that a stiffer eos describes degenerate nuclear matter .",
    "subsequently , by fitting @xmath22- , @xmath23- and @xmath24-band light curves , @xcite found a value for the inclination of @xmath25 , which combined with the parameters found by @xcite gave a value for the primary mass of @xmath26 m@xmath3 .",
    "this latter mass estimate is consistent with the canonical ns mass of 1.4  m@xmath3 at the 2@xmath27 level .",
    "@xcite also found that x - ray heating of the secondary star contributed very little to the overall light curves , possibly because of the large orbital separation , or because a flared accretion disc is shielding the secondary from the x - rays .",
    "in contrast , analysis of x - ray bursts from cyg  x-2 allowed @xcite to constrain the primary mass to be @xmath28  m@xmath3 , lower than that obtained by previous dynamical studies , and equal to the canonical ns mass of 1.4  m@xmath3 , within the uncertainties .    here , we present results based on spectroscopic observations of cyg  x-2 taken in 2006 september / october .",
    "our primary motivation for this work was to perform doppler tomography for this long period system , to study the accretion flow , and especially to make the first comparison between the radial velocity of the secondary as inferred from the bowen blend technique and absorption line measurements ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "confirmation of this technique for a system where an independent measure of the radial velocity is available gives further support for using bowen blend to measure @xmath5 in situations where the secondary star is not directly observable . in light of the ns mass estimates",
    "discussed above , we also used our data to perform a new radial velocity analysis of this system to confirm the suggested massive nature of the ns star primary .",
    "our data consist of optical spectra , acquired with the fast spectrograph @xcite , at the cassegrain focus of the 1.5-m tillinghast telescope at the fred l. whipple observatory , mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona .",
    "the fast3 university of arizona sta520a ( sn4377 ) ccd was used , with @xmath29 15  @xmath30 m pixels in the binned images .",
    "the spectra were taken using the 600 lines  mm@xmath1 grating , with a 2  arcsec slit , giving a spectral coverage of @xmath42000   .",
    "the spectra were obtained on 16 nights in 2006 september and october , covering four orbits .",
    "one spectrum was obtained each night , along with henear arc lamp exposures , bias , flat and dark frames , and one spectrophotometric standard exposure ( bd@xmath31 ) . for 14 of the nights ,",
    "only one arc spectrum was available for the wavelength calibration of each cyg  x-2 spectrum .",
    "for the other two nights , the cyg  x-2 exposures were bracketed by arc spectra .",
    "the frames were firstly processed using the  routines to remove instrumental effects .",
    "the spectra were then optimally extracted using tasks in the  package .",
    "wavelength solutions were found by fitting a 3rd order cubic spline to @xmath460  70 lines in each arc spectrum , giving an rms error of @xmath320.04   , and these solutions were then applied to the target frames .",
    "the resulting dispersion was @xmath40.74    pixel@xmath1 , with a resolution ( measured from arc lines ) of @xmath42.3   . for comparison ,",
    "the observations of @xcite had a resolution of @xmath40.5  0.8  a. table [ observations ] gives details of our observations . in order to verify the wavelength calibration ,",
    "the sky lines were examined . only five sky lines were isolated and strong enough to be useful i.e. with a fwhm similar to the spectral resolution .",
    ".observations of cyg  x-2 from 2006 september and october .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , < , < , < \" , ]     in our work , and in the work of @xcite the non - metal lines and the ca@xmath7ii lines were masked out during cross - correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ norm ] ) .",
    "therefore all values of @xmath5 and @xmath14 in table [ k2_gamma ] are essentially based on the velocities of the metal absorption lines .",
    "we now examine possible reasons for our lower value of @xmath5 compared to that of @xcite .",
    "firstly , it is possible that there are systematic errors in our wavelength solution , given that for most of our spectra only a single arc lamp exposure was available , and a correction based on the sky spectra was required .",
    "however , our rv curves appear to be quite sinusoidal , which would be unlikely if each spectrum had random errors in the wavelength calibration  indeed , the rv curve from the uncorrected spectra deviates considerably from a sinusoid . also as we mention in section [ data ] , for the cases where we had two arc spectra , the maximum difference between the wavelength solutions using the two arc spectra , and using the sky line correction technique is @xmath40.02   , or @xmath41.3  km  s@xmath1 at @xmath84686 .",
    "our rv curves include the uncertainties in wavelength scales , and also the slight differences in the cross - correlation values that arise when different interpolations are used .",
    "finally , we find a value for @xmath14 almost identical to that found by @xcite , which would again be improbable if there were any systematic errors in our wavelength scales .",
    "hence , we believe our measurement of @xmath5 to be accurate , and so we require an alternative explanation for the difference between this measurement and that of @xcite . because our he@xmath7ii doppler tomography confirms that the secondary is irradiated by x - rays from the central source , the absorption lines from the irradiated face of the secondary star may be weaker than those from the non - irradiated face .",
    "the irradiation of the secondary may be such that the absorption lines are completely quenched on the irradiated hemisphere of the secondary star . in this case , an rv curve based on the velocity of absorption lines from the secondary star will result in a @xmath5 value which reflects the velocity of the non - irradiated hemisphere .",
    "this is larger than the velocity of the centre of mass of the secondary star . if the irradiation of the secondary was variable , such that at some phases the absorption lines on the irradiated face of the secondary were not fully quenched",
    ", then one would expect the @xmath5 value derived from the resulting rv curve to lie somewhere between the true value and the maximum value obtained for complete quenching .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of this effect .",
    "@xcite argue that differences in @xmath5 found by different authors for the lmxb 2s  0921@xmath33630 may be due to variable irradiation effects , and we suggest that the same may well apply in the case of cyg  x-2 .",
    "@xcite show that the long term x - ray variability in cyg  x-2 can be explained by a precessing warped accretion disc .",
    "the changing orientation of this disc warp will cause the irradiation of the secondary to vary ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    to estimate the effects of irradiation for cyg  x-2 , we use the approach of @xcite . if the absorption centre of the secondary star is displaced from the centre of mass by an amount @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the radius of the secondary star and @xmath36 is the fractional displacement , then : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the separation between the secondary and the binary centre of mass .",
    "based on our new value for @xmath17 , @xmath39 . using the formula of @xcite ,",
    "the radius of the secondary is @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 . in the extreme case , where there is no absorption from the inner hemisphere of the secondary star , @xmath42 , and @xmath43  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we find that the measured value of @xmath5 can be as much as @xmath415  km  s@xmath1 greater than the true value . this difference is more than enough to explain the different values found by various authors .    in order to investigate the effect of irradiation on the absorption features of the secondary in cyg  x-2",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ ew ] the ew of the fe@xmath7i  @xmath85227.15 absorption line as a function of the ew of he@xmath7ii  @xmath84686 ( which we take as indicative of the intensity of the x - rays intercepted by the secondary star ) .",
    "this shows that , for this line at least , the stronger the he@xmath7ii  @xmath84686 emission line ( and hence x - ray flux ) , the weaker the secondary absorption line .    on the other hand",
    ", a doppler tomogram of the ca@xmath7i  @xmath84227 absorption line shows that the peak occurs at a value consistent with that found in our rv analysis .",
    "however , the ew of this line does not show any trend when plotted against the ew of the he@xmath7ii  @xmath84686 emission line .",
    "this may suggest that this particular line is less susceptible to the effects of irradiation than other lines ( e.g. the fe@xmath7i  @xmath85227.15 line ) , and that the radial velocity determined from this line more accurately reflects the motion of the centre of mass of the secondary star .",
    "because irradiation of the secondary star causes the measured @xmath5 to be greater than the true value , our measurement of a lower value may be closer to the true value than the estimates of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also note from table [ k2_gamma ] that observations obtained over a shorter time base ( * ? ? ? * and this work ) appear to suggest systematically lower values of @xmath5 than those obtained over a longer period @xcite .",
    "we speculate that observations obtained over a longer timebase , and wider range of disc precession phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , result in more variable irradiation of the secondary star .",
    "it is possible that the changing values of @xmath44 that result from this may explain the variation in @xmath5 we observe .",
    "our results indicate that the mass of the ns in cyg  x-2 ( @xmath45  m@xmath3 ) is typical of a canonical ns , a downward revision of the previous estimates of a 95% confidence lower limit of 1.88  m@xmath3 @xcite and @xmath26  m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lmxb 2s  0921@xmath33630 has also recently had its primary mass estimate reduced , from @xmath46 m@xmath3 @xcite to @xmath47  m@xmath3 @xcite and @xmath48  m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "our dynamical mass estimate for the ns in cyg  x-2 is consistent with the mass estimate of @xcite ( @xmath49  m@xmath3 ) , based on observations of type - i x - ray bursts from this system .",
    "calculations by @xcite found that there are inconsistencies between the distance based on their optical observations ( @xmath50  kpc ) and the distance estimate of @xcite based on x - ray observations of a type - i radius - expansion burst ( @xmath51  kpc ) . to address this",
    ", we now re - calculate the distance and observed absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath52 ) of cygnus x-2 , and compare the latter with the expected value based on our new parameters .",
    "taking the peak x - ray flux of @xmath53  erg  @xmath54  s@xmath1 @xcite to be at the eddington limit , and with @xmath45  m@xmath3 , the eddington luminosity of the system is @xmath55  erg  s@xmath1 ( assuming cosmic composition ) and the distance to the source is therefore @xmath56  kpc . with @xmath57  mag , and @xmath58  mag @xcite , this gives @xmath59  mag for the system .    assuming a secondary star with a surface temperature of @xmath60  k @xcite",
    ", @xmath45  m@xmath3 and @xmath61 , the radius of the roche lobe of the secondary star is @xmath62",
    "r@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "hence , we calculate that the @xmath52 of the secondary should be @xmath63  mag . with a @xmath23-band disc fraction ( @xmath64 ) of @xmath65 @xcite , the absolute magnitude of the system should therefore be @xmath66  mag .",
    "this is marginally consistent with the expected value for this system , calculated above assuming a distance of @xmath56  kpc .",
    "these estimates would better agree if the secondary temperature was slightly higher .",
    "indeed , we note that the spectral classification of @xcite is a9  @xmath67  2 subtypes , and an a7 star ( with a surface temperature of @xmath68  k ) would yield @xmath69  mag for the secondary and @xmath70  mag for the system as a whole , leading to a distance of @xmath71  kpc .",
    "hence , we conclude that the absolute magnitude calculated from the observed apparent magnitude and the distance based on x - ray measurements is consistent with the expected absolute magnitude based on the spectral type , surface temperature , disc fraction , primary mass and mass ratio .    for many systems ,",
    "the secondary star dominates the infrared light , and fitting the ellipsoidal modulation in the ir light curves can be used to better constrain the inclination . for cyg  x-2 , such a scenario would be particularly desirable , as the modulation in the optical light curves is dominated by variable contamination from the accretion disc .",
    "the _ 2mass _ @xmath72-band magnitude of cyg  x-2 is @xmath413.05  mag .",
    "using @xmath73 @xcite , @xmath74 @xcite and a distance of 10.4  kpc , the dereddended absolute @xmath72-band magnitude is @xmath75  mag . if the secondary is an a7 star , then @xmath76  mag . using the absolute @xmath23-band magnitude for the secondary of @xmath77  mag ( calculated above ) , @xmath78 for the secondary should be @xmath4@xmath79  mag . to achieve the observed @xmath78 for the system of @xmath80  mag would require a @xmath72-band disc fraction of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , it would appear that even in the @xmath72-band , the accretion disc contributes a considerable fraction of the light .",
    "our doppler tomography shows that the peak of the he@xmath7ii emission originates on the inner hemisphere of the donor star .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that the emission lines in their uv spectra also appear to originate in the secondary star .",
    "there appears to be little or no emission from the gas stream / accretion disc impact region .",
    "curiously , @xcite find that the optical light curves show no evidence for heating of the secondary star , yet our he@xmath7ii doppler tomograms show that the secondary is certainly intercepting x - rays from the primary .",
    "it is unclear how the secondary could be irradiated by the central source , and yet the light curves show no evidence for heating .",
    "the situation is reversed in the n@xmath7iii  @xmath82 tomogram ( fig .",
    "[ dt_bowen_main ] ) , where the majority of the emission arises at the location of the hotspot , between the gas stream trajectory and the velocity of the accretion disc along the gas stream .",
    "generally , the bowen blend contains several lines , with the strongest normally being the n@xmath7iii  @xmath82 line .",
    "however , in our data , this is the only line which is clearly visible .",
    "the location of the emission in the doppler tomogram shows that significant bowen blend emission can occur from sources other than the secondary star in lmxbs .",
    "this is in contrast to the suggestion by @xcite that the velocity of the bowen blend emission can be used universally to determine the orbital velocity of the secondary star .",
    "by cross - correlating our spectra against template spectra , we find a value for the projected radial velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary which is significantly lower then that found by @xcite . based on this new value for @xmath5",
    ", we find a larger value for the mass ratio , using the rotational broadening value calculated by @xcite .",
    "combined with the inclination estimates by @xcite , this implies that the mass of the primary in this system is @xmath6  m@xmath3 , less massive than previously determined , although still consistent with the mass estimate of @xcite at the 1@xmath27 level , and similar to the value found by @xcite based on observations of type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "we have presented doppler tomograms of cyg  x-2 , the first doppler tomography of such a long period system .",
    "our tomography of the he@xmath7ii  @xmath84686 emission line shows that the majority of the emission is from near the irradiated face of the secondary , with much weaker emission from the accretion disc .",
    "doppler tomography of the n@xmath7iii  @xmath84640 emission line shows that the emission is primarily from the gas stream / accretion disc impact region .",
    "the n@xmath7iii tomography demonstrates that care must be taken when interpreting bowen blend tomograms , so that the hotspot is not confused with the secondary , particularly for systems where the ephemeris is not accurately known .",
    "the measured value of @xmath5 can vary by up to 15  km  s@xmath1 , depending on the irradiation of the secondary star by the central x - ray source , and this may explain the differences in @xmath5 found by different authors .",
    "further investigation of the effects of irradiation of the secondary star  for example , by performing a series of radial velocity studies over a range of disc precession phases  is required to fully understand how large this effect is on the mass estimate of the neutron star in cyg  x-2 .",
