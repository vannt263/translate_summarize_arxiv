    "large volume galaxy redshift surveys are mapping large scale structure in the universe , measuring the three dimensional positions of millions of galaxies .",
    "this data teaches us not only the statistics of clustering but can be used to measure cosmic distances and growth , and constrain cosmological models .",
    "the third dimension of the data , the redshift , allows investigation of two effects : the role of cosmic expansion in distinguishing transverse and radial distances , and the role of peculiar velocities , measured through their induced redshift space anisotropy , as a probe of the cosmic structure growth rate .",
    "redshift space distortions ( rsd ) are induced by the large scale velocity flow of galaxies and are thus intimately connected to the growth rate of cosmic structure @xcite . over the last 10 years , as the size of spectroscopic surveys has increased , this effect has been exploited , allowing testable predictions of general relativity on large scales  @xcite .",
    "geometric distortions are induced by distances along and perpendicular to the line of sight being fundamentally different .",
    "measuring the ratio of galaxy clustering radially to transversely provides a probe of this , called the alcock - paczynski effect  @xcite . assuming the incorrect cosmological model for the coordinate transformation from redshift space to comoving cartesian space leaves a residual geometric distortion . in observations the geometric effect",
    "is convolved with rsd  @xcite , but the fixed physical scale of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) can alleviate this covariance  @xcite .",
    "the quantity and quality of data now allows the distinction of these effects through a full two dimensional ( transverse - radial ) analysis , rather than relying on a spherical average , a squashing ( ap ) ratio , or the lowest few multipoles of the clustering distribution . following the method tested in  @xcite",
    ", we fit the clustering correlation function in the transverse - radial plane , paying particular attention to the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) `` ring of power ''  @xcite but using the full 2d clustering information .",
    "another advantage of this analysis is that it is carried out in a substantially model independent manner , without assuming lcdm or any other dark energy model .",
    "instead we directly fit for the angular distance @xmath0 , hubble parameter @xmath1 , and growth rate @xmath5 simultaneously from the 2d clustering statistics .",
    "variation of each of these give distinct distortions of the clustering power isocontours , including the bao ring of power .",
    "we analyze the sdss dr9 galaxies in the boss cmass @xcite sample at an effective redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "this data has already given rise to several significant results in measuring cosmological distances , the first bao detection in dr9 coming from @xcite and .",
    "this was followed by a more detailed study which found the distance ratio @xmath7 mpc @xcite using typical correlation functions and power spectra analyses , where @xmath8 is a spherically averaged distance measure .",
    "anisotropic analysis using `` clustering wedges '' placed tight constraints on the angular diameter distance and the hubble constant : @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these measurements were confirmed by @xcite and @xcite used the full shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions to obtain estimates of @xmath11 , @xmath0 and the growth rate @xmath2 .",
    "this reduced set of cosmological observables was then used to place tight constraints on the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "angularly - averaged statistics , such as the multipoles mentioned above , successfully placed constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "however , such statistics become complicated when one considers excluding data along the line - of - sight , e.g.  that are much noisier than the data perpendicular to it @xcite or are difficult to model accurately because of velocity or nonlinear effects .",
    "it is thus meaningful to present the analysis of the correlation function in the transverse - radial plane , without angle averaging , as a complementary method .",
    "another advantage of using the full 2d correlation function is that one can easily distinguish between the geometric and velocity ( rsd ) effects , clarifying the physical interpretation .",
    "the 2d correlation function including the bao scale was first analyzed by @xcite but the analysis relied on linear theory @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we developed a formalism that predicts the correlation function in the 2d plane with nonlinear perturbation theory . following",
    "the method tested in  @xcite , we here fit the clustering correlation function in the transverse - radial plane to data .",
    "the outline of this paper proceeds as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we briefly review the analysis method and treatment of nonlinearities and velocity effects .",
    "section  [ sec : measure ] details the measurement procedure including estimation of the covariance matrix .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and the implications for cosmological models are discussed in sec .  [ sec : cosmology ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , with appendix  [ sec : zeff ] exploring cautions regarding interpretation of @xmath12 at the accuracy of next generation surveys .",
    "the two  point correlation function of galaxy clustering , @xmath13 , is described as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the distant - observer limit , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transverse and the radial directions with respect to the observer .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , several effects give rise to anisotropy between these directions . in the linear density perturbation regime",
    ", rsd causes the clustering pattern to be squeezed along the line of sight ( i.e.  the @xmath15-direction ) , leading to an apparent enhancement of the amplitude of the observed correlation function .",
    "this is known as kaiser effect  @xcite . on the other hand , in the non  linear regime ,",
    "the random virial motions of galaxies residing in halos introduce elongated clustering along the line of sight , which is dubbed the finger of god effect ( fog ) .",
    "this dispersion effect has significant impact , and even on large scales ( in linear theory ) , a simple description of @xmath16 using the kaiser formula alone may not be adequate along the @xmath15 direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our previous paper",
    ", we combined this dispersion effect with the kaiser formula to analyze two  dimensional anisotropy structure of dr7 catalogue  @xcite .",
    "the precision of the updated dr9 clustering catalog is greatly improved . due to this improvement ,",
    "systematic uncertainties in accounting for the anisotropic clustering effects gain greater influence .",
    "therefore we here employ improved distortion models to analyze the better precision maps . due to a strong correlation between density and velocity fields ,",
    "the mapping between real and redshift space is intrinsically non  linear  @xcite . in general",
    ", it appears as a not  closed iteration of polynomials for which a more elaborate description than simple factorized formulation needs to be used .",
    "however at large separation several leading polynomials dominate .",
    "in addition , we apply the non  linear correction terms using the resummed perturbation theory called regpt  @xcite . when restricting analysis to the quasi - linear regime , the result is the non  linear portions of the power spectra are better separated from the linear spectra , for which the assumption of perfect cross  correlation between density and velocity fields is verified .    in brief",
    ", we adopt the redshift - space power spectrum , @xmath17 , given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be recast as [ eq : pkred_in_q ] ( k , ) = _ n=0",
    "^ 4q_2n(k)^2ng^fog(k_p ) , where @xmath18 is a free parameter representing small scale velocity effects .",
    "our previous analysis suggests that as long as we consider the weakly nonlinear scales , cosmological analysis can be made independently of the functional form of fog effect .",
    "the functions @xmath19 are given in  @xcite .    from the power spectrum",
    "one can compute the correlation function by fourier transform .",
    "the redshift - space correlation function @xmath20 is generally expanded as [ eq : xi_eq ] ^s(,)&= & ( k,)e^i*k * + & = & _  even_(s ) p _ ( ) , with @xmath21 being the legendre polynomials . here ,",
    "we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the moments of correlation function are given in  @xcite .",
    "here we include the moments up to @xmath24 , since the higher - order moments @xmath25 are shown to contribute negligibly .",
    "we use data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , data release 9 ( dr9 ) .",
    "sdss has mapped over one quarter of the sky in five photometric bands down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath26 . the photometric data is reduced and from it are selected targets for followup spectroscopy . the spectroscopic survey , known as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , is designed to obtain spectra for @xmath27 million galaxies over a 10,000 square degree footprint .    in an effort to control the evolution of galaxy bias over large redshift ranges the boss targets",
    "are selected in such a way as to have approximately constant stellar mass ( cmass ) .",
    "this is obtained using colour selections based on the passive galaxy template of @xcite .",
    "the majority of cmass galaxies are bright , central galaxies ( in the halo model framework ) and are thus highly biased ( @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "the cmass sample  @xcite is defined by z&>&0.4 + 17.5<i_cmod&<&19.9 + r_mod - i_mod&<&2.0 + d_&>&0.55 + i_fib2&<&21.5 + i_cmod&<&19.86 + 1.6(d_-0.8 ) + i_psf - i_mod&>&0.2 + 0.2(20.0-i_mod ) + z_psf - z_mod&>&9.125 - 0.46z_mod  , where the last two conditions provide a star - galaxy separator and @xmath29 is defined as @xcite , d_=r_mod - i_mod-(g_mod - r_mod)/8.0  .",
    "each spectroscopically observed galaxy is weighted to account for three distinct observational effects : redshift failure , @xmath30 ; minimum variance , @xmath31 ; and angular variation , @xmath32 .",
    "these weights are described in more detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "firstly , galaxies that lack a redshift due to fiber collisions or inadequate spectral information are accounted for by reweighting the nearest galaxy by a weight @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of close neighbours without an estimated redshift .",
    "secondly , the finite sampling of the density field leads to use of the minimum variance fkp prescription @xcite where each galaxy is assigned a weight according to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the comoving number density of galaxy population @xmath37 at redshift @xmath38 and one conventionally evaluates the weight at a constant power @xmath39 , as in @xcite .",
    "( but see appendix  [ sec : zeff ] . )    the third weight corrects for angular variations in completeness and systematics related to the angular variations in stellar density that make detection of galaxies harder in over - crowded regions of the sky @xcite .",
    "the total weight for each galaxy is then the product of these three weights , @xmath40 .",
    "the random catalog points are also weighted but they only include the minimum variance fkp weight .",
    "the cmass galaxy sample is distributed over the range @xmath41 , with an effective redshift z_eff=  , giving the value @xmath6 . the effective volume v_eff=()^2v(z_i )  , where @xmath42 is the volume of a shell at redshift @xmath38 , is @xmath43gpc@xmath44 .",
    "we compute the redshift - space 2-dimensional correlation function @xmath45 using the boss dr9 galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "we perform the coordinate transforms for two fiducial spatially - flat cosmological models : wmap9 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) and planck ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "although the parameter fitting procedure should be insensitive to the choice of fiducial model , we perform this check for consistency .",
    "we estimate the correlation function using the standard landy - szalay estimator  @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of galaxy  galaxy pairs , @xmath54 the number of galaxy - random pairs , and @xmath55 is the number of random ",
    "random pairs , all separated by a distance @xmath56 and @xmath57 . each pair is weighted by the product of the individual weightings of each point .",
    "the random point catalogue constitutes an unclustered but observationally representative sample of the boss cmass survey .",
    "the points are chosen to reside within the survey geometry and the redshifts are obtained via the random shuffle method of @xcite .",
    "the randoms are also assigned completeness weights , just as for the galaxies . to reduce the statistical variance of the estimator we use @xmath58 times as many randoms as we have galaxies .",
    "we calculate the correlation function in 15 bins of dimension @xmath59 , linearly spaced in the range @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting two point correlation function in fig .",
    "[ fig : measured_xi ] shows the typical kaiser @xcite compression at small @xmath14 ( near to the line of sight ) and the emergence of the 2d bao ring at @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to the correlation function we need to know the errors on it .",
    "because different bins of the correlation function are strongly correlated , it is necessary to estimate a covariance matrix to give correct constraints on cosmological parameters . as in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we use the mock galaxy catalog created by @xcite .",
    "this catalog has the same survey geometry and number density as the cmass galaxy sample that was used in our analysis and 611 mock realizations were created using second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) for the galaxy clustering .    for each realization",
    "we compute the correlation function as we did for the observed catalog in section [ sec:2pcf_boss ] and obtain a covariance matrix by & & ( _ i,_j)= + & & ^n_mocks_k=1[_k(*r*_i)-(*r*_i)][_k(*r*_j)-(*r*_j ) ]  , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 represents the value of the correlation function in the @xmath37th bin of @xmath64 in the @xmath65th realization , and @xmath66 is the mean value of @xmath63 over all the realizations .",
    "we can then obtain the normalized covariance matrix as @xmath67 in order to reduce the statistical noise in our covariance matrix , we perform a singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the matrix as done in @xcite , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are orthogonal matrices that span the range and the null space of @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , a diagonal matrix with the singular values along the diagonal .",
    "when using svd the @xmath73 value becomes more difficult to interpret as it changes as one cuts the noisiest eigenvalues .",
    "however we establish that the reduced @xmath73 converges to a constant value above 250 modes .",
    "to be conservative we use 350 out of 400 available modes .",
    "the estimate of the covariance matrix obtained from a finite number of realizations is necessarily biased ( , see also @xcite ) . to obtain the unbiased covariance matrix @xmath74",
    ", we multiply the original covariance @xmath75 by a correction factor @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of bins of @xmath45 used for the analysis .",
    "to fit the correlation function with as model independent cosmology inputs as possible , we assume that the shape of the power spectra is given by the early universe conditions measured by cmb experiments .",
    "we denote this primordial spectrum convolved with the transfer function as @xmath78 .",
    "this then evolves coherently through all scales from the last scattering surface .",
    "that is , the growth occurs through a time - varying , scale - independent amplitude growth factor ( this assumption breaks down in theories that introduce significant scale dependence , such as some modified gravity theories ) .",
    "propagating this through to cosmological parameters requires assumptions on the cosmological model , e.g.  the nature of dark energy . to remain substantially model independent we use the growth rate itself as our variable .",
    "the power spectra are then given by [ eq : pkdmg ] p_bb(k , a)&=&d_m(k)g_b^2(a ) , + p_(k , a)&=&d_m(k)g_^2(a ) , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the growth functions of density and peculiar velocity .",
    "we define here @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the standard linear bias parameter between galaxy tracers and the underlying dark matter density .",
    "the expression of @xmath78 is available in  @xcite , and assumed to be given precisely by cmb experiments , such as wmap9 and planck experiments .",
    "we refer to this as an early universe prior .",
    "we incorporate the uncertainty from the cmb anisotropy data in the amplitude determination of the initial spectra , @xmath83 , into the growth function @xmath84 , i.e.  @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the intrinsic growth function .",
    "the clustering correlation function @xmath45 is measured in comoving distances , while galaxy locations use angular coordinates and redshift in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "a fiducial cosmology is required for conversion into comoving space .",
    "we use the best fit lcdm universe to wmap9 or planck .",
    "the observed anisotropy correlation function using this model is transformed into true comoving coordinates using the transverse and radial distances , involving @xmath0 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the approximate fiducial maps are created by rescaling the transverse and radial distances , using ^fid&= &  ^true + ^fid&= &  ^true  , where `` fid '' and `` true '' denote the fiducial and true distances .",
    "thus the theoretical @xmath88 with potentially true @xmath0 and @xmath87 is fitted to the observed @xmath89 using the rescaling in the above equations .",
    "given the early universe prior on the power spectrum shape , both distances and growth functions are measured simultaneously to high precision  @xcite .",
    "this holds even without assuming the frw integral relation between @xmath87 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus we do not have to assume any particular cosmological model or restrict to zero curvature or lcdm .",
    "finally , we introduce a parameter representing non  linear contamination to the power spectra of the density and velocity fields .",
    "even on linear scales the damping effect on the power spectrum amplitude caused by random galaxy motions still remains .",
    "this is described by the gaussian model for the fog effect in eq .",
    "[ eq : pkred_in_q ] , with @xmath18 a free parameter giving the velocity dispersion . however , the non  perturbative damping effects are not fully understood , and the gaussian model may be insuficient on non  linear scales .",
    "we therefore do not use the measured @xmath45 for bins in which this breakdown is likely .",
    "two cut  off s are used : 1 ) @xmath90 represents the scales on which non  linear description of @xmath91 is uncertain , and 2 ) @xmath92 represents the scales on which gaussian fog functional form may not be appropriate .",
    "these are set to be @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( although we also consider @xmath95 ) .",
    "this strategy was tested and proved valid using simulations in our previous work .",
    "we follow the same method as presented in song , okumura and taruya ( 2013 )  @xcite .    in summary , we have @xmath96 and @xmath80 to describe growth functions , @xmath0 and @xmath87 to fit distance measures , and @xmath18 to model the fog effect .",
    "the form of the fog is taken to be gaussian and the shape of the linear spectra is assumed to be given as an early universe prior by cmb experiments .",
    "first , we investigate the appropriate cut  off scales .",
    "the @xmath90 is introduced due to the uncertainty of the resummed perturbation theory regpt at smaller scales .",
    "it is conservatively set to be @xmath93 which allows the perfect cross  correlation between density and velocity fields .",
    "in addition @xmath92 is used because the improved @xmath45 in eq .  [",
    "eq : xi_eq ] is not applicable at bins in which the higher order terms of non  perturbative effect are dominant along the line of sight .",
    "it was set to be @xmath95 in  @xcite , and reproduced the true values successfully .",
    "but we find that it may be too ambitious for the actual dr9 cmass catalogue .    when the broadband shape of spectra and the distance measures are known , the 2d bao ring is invariant to the changes of the coherent galaxy bias and coherent motion growth function .",
    "when @xmath96 increases / decreases , the bao tip points coherently move counter  clockwise / clockwise .",
    "when @xmath80 increases / decreases , the bao tip points move toward / away from the pivot point ( equal radial and transverse separation ) .",
    "if the correct distance model is known , the tip points of bao peaks form an invariant ring regardless of galaxy bias and coherent motion .",
    "the ratio between the observed transverse and radial distances varies with the assumed cosmology and , if the shape of an object is _ a priori _ known , can provide a measure of @xmath97 ( ap test ) .",
    "the outer measured @xmath45 contours are too vague to reveal detailed bao peak structure , but those peak points can define the measured 2d bao ring . figure  [ fig : varyingcut_planck ] shows the 2d correlation function contours , and the best fit 2d bao rings .",
    "the left and right panels use @xmath95 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "if the correlation function model is accurate down to @xmath95 then the two rings should be consistent .",
    "however , the 2d bao ring using @xmath95 not only disagrees with that using @xmath94 but also from the measured circle .",
    "basically the small , nonlinear scales where the model is imperfect are distorting the results at all scales .",
    "this can be seen by looking at several inner contours at small scales , those corresponding to @xmath99 . in the left panel",
    "the solid curves attempt to fit tightly the small scale contours very close to the line of sight , at the price of a poor fit to the large scale , linear contours .",
    "by contrast , in the right panel with @xmath94 the residual non  perturbative effects are observed clearly in the inner contours , but the linear contours are better behaved .",
    "this problem with an overambitious use of small scales is seen as well in fig .",
    "[ fig : varyingcut_wmap9 ] using the wmap9 early universe prior instead .",
    "therefore we use more conservative bound at @xmath94 .",
    "we tested our final results using different @xmath92 at 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 @xmath100 and found they converged for @xmath101 .",
    "the effect on cosmology of using a cut allowing more of the non  linear regime is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] .    the dashed contours in fig .",

    "[ fig : varyingcut_wmap9 ] using the wmap9 early universe prior , while the estimated 2d bao ring agrees approximately with the measured 2d bao ring , peak points along the ring do not well match to each other .",
    "the dashed contours here represent @xmath45 of the wmap9 lcdm concordance model . unlike the planck case , the measured peak points shift toward the pivot point for the outer contour , less so for the inner contours . as discussed above , this is a signature of an increased velocity growth function ; we expect the measured @xmath104 to be higher than fiducial in this case .",
    "we present the results for the measured distances and growth functions in table  [ tab : measurements ] .",
    "our baseline value of @xmath94 is used throughout this section .",

    "the line of sight distance quantity @xmath87 , related to radial separations , is also measured to be consistent with lcdm predictions . for either the planck or wmap9 early universe priors",
    "the agreement is within @xmath106 .",
    "greater tension is seen if one uses @xmath95 , which lowers the measured @xmath87 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the growth functions influence the location of peaks along the rings of power ( see @xcite for illustrations ) . for the planck early universe prior",
    ", the best fit peak structure is nearly identical to that predicted by the planck lcdm model .",
    "the measured coherent growth function has @xmath107 , while the fiducial value is @xmath108 .",
    "this measurement can be converted to a value at @xmath6 of the standard parameter @xmath109 , which is very close to the fiducial model value of 0.47 .",
    "when the wmap9 early universe prior is used , the measured @xmath80 becomes bigger than lcdm prediction .",
    "like the distance measurements , the measured @xmath80 is offset by @xmath110 .",
    "note that @xmath80 has a relatively large error , about @xmath111 .",
    "this is partly caused by floating @xmath18 as a free parameter .",
    "in the linear regime , when the first order contribution of the gaussian fog function dominates , this factor is nearly featureless and becomes significantly degenerate with coherent growth function .",
    "using more non - linear scales ( smaller @xmath92 ) would break this degeneracy , reducing the error contour but introducing bias ; we show this explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] .",
    "the galaxy bias is estimated from the @xmath96 measurement .",
    "the bias @xmath82 is measured to be @xmath112 and @xmath113 for planck and wmap9 respectively .",
    "those values are consistent with cmass catalogues  @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath18 indicates the level of the fog effect .",
    "for both planck and wmap9 cases , it is observed to be small , about @xmath114 , but with significant uncertainty .",
    "our analysis approach has been model independent , obtaining constraints on the distances @xmath0 and @xmath87  without even assuming a friedmann integral relation between them  and on the velocity growth factor @xmath115 .",
    "while we have so far compared the values individually to the best fit lcdm predictions from the cmb , we should also look at the joint probabilities .",
    "we can test for consistency with the lcdm model by examining whether the fixed relations between these quantities in lcdm , i.e.  the 1d curves in the @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 planes , all intersect the measured confidence contours .",
    "furthermore , we can generalize the test by allowing for spatial curvature or non-@xmath3 dark energy .",
    "for the growth factor @xmath115 this comparison also allows a test of general relativity since within this theory the distance quantities ( measuring the cosmic expansion ) have a definite relation to the growth quantity @xmath104 .",
    "figures  [ fig : dah ] , [ fig : dag ] , [ fig : hg ] show the three planes of pairs of the cosmological quantities and their joint measurement contours , overlaid with the allowed theory curves of lcdm , olcdm ( with spatial curvature ) , wcdm ( dark energy with constant equation of state ratio @xmath119 ) , and owcdm .",
    "each one is shown for a wmap9 ( left panels ) or planck ( right panels ) early universe prior .    in the @xmath116 space ,",
    "the cosmological models all lie within a narrow swath , somewhat separated from the best fit point in the planck prior case .",
    "however , the 68% confidence level contour of the measurements overlaps the lcdm model . in the @xmath117 or @xmath118 planes ,",
    "the standard cosmologies span a wider range of the space . in both planes",
    "the measurements are consistent with lcdm at the 68% confidenece level .",
    "there is no sign of significant deviation from lcdm in either distances or growth , and hence no sign of deviation from general relativity either .",
    "note , however , that if we attempt to push the data by using data to smaller , non - linear scales , then we do find deviations .",
    "in particular , @xmath104 rapidly becomes underestimated , with values of 0.42 for a cutoff at @xmath120 and 0.34 for @xmath95 .",
    "however increasing @xmath92 above @xmath98 does not change the result , indicating the value has converged .",
    "had we included the smaller scales , we would have found that no cosmology ( lcdm , olcdm , wcdm ) would have given good fits to the measurement contours .",
    "moreover , we would have apparent evidence for a violation of general relativity . the apparent strong growth suppression in the measured growth rate @xmath121 would yield an apparent gravitational growth index @xmath122 @xcite of @xmath123 , in contrast to the value 0.55 for general relativity .",
    "figure  [ fig : cut20 ] shows what occurs in the cosmology parameters if data down to @xmath95 is used .",
    "the shifting of the best fit values , and the reduction in the uncertainty on @xmath104 , clearly indicate that substantial information to fit cosmology is coming from small scales , not just the bao ring scales .",
    "unfortunately , the sensitivity of the results to low @xmath92 ( as opposed to the convergence found when @xmath124 ) indicates that the modeling of the 2d correlation function on these scales is inadequate .",
    "further improvements are necessary before these scales can be used to provide robust results .",
    "in terms of fourier wavenumber , note that k= 0.16()hmpc^-1  . in comparisons to simulations",
    "the 2d anisotropic clustering model ( not simply the 1d real space power spectrum or angle averaged correlation function ) performed well down to @xmath98 @xcite . another way to spuriously produce a shift outside the swath of standard cosmologies , and",
    "hence possibly conclude there is a violation of general relativity , is to misestimate @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in appendix  [ sec : zeff ] , @xmath12 is itself anisotropic and will differ for different cosmological quantities but not at a level significant with current data .",
    "we have used the boss cmass dr9 galaxies to perform a cosmology model independent , fully 2d anistropic clustering analysis . using an early universe prior from cmb experiments , from the clustering correlation function",
    "we can extract the angular diameter distance @xmath0 , hubble scale @xmath87 , and growth rate @xmath104 at the effective survey redshift @xmath6 .",
    "these are found to be consistent with lcdm , and by comparing expansion of cosmic distances with growth of cosmic structure we also test general relativity , again finding consistency .",
    "two cautions are relevant to such an analysis , one important already to current data and one entering for future , high precision surveys .",
    "use of small scale measurements of the correlation functions , which can be significantly contaminated by non ",
    "linear gravitational physics , is fraught with peril .",
    "we find this can distort the cosmological results , moving them wholly outside the range of standard cosmology and give a spurious signature of breakdown of general relativity .",
    "insidiously , the extra data also helps shrink the contours , so the cosmological quantities appear well determined .",
    "we employ the improved redshift distortion model of @xcite , but this is still limited in accuracy to scales where higher order terms of the fog effect are negligible . to prevent bias we cut most of the measured @xmath45 along the line of sight out from this analysis .",
    "this conservative treatment is well defined in the full 2d anisotropy analysis but could be problematic when using a multipole expansion instead .",
    "it will be interesting to compare our conservative results to those from a multipole analysis .",
    "another aspect is that we find that the results from the real , observed , data are more contaminated with the small scale velocity and non - linear effects than those from the mock catalogues . in the simulations",
    ", @xmath95 is acceptable to measure observables using the improved perturbation theory model .",
    "however , in the real dataset , the cut  off scale must be extended to @xmath125 to obtain convergent results ( insensitive to the exact choice of @xmath92 ) .",
    "this can also be seen by comparing the 2d bao ring with the measured bao peak structure .",
    "the second caution comes from the interpretation dependence of the effective redshift @xmath12 .",
    "since it involves the galaxy power spectrum ( or correlation function ) it is intrinsically anisotropic and will take on different values depending on what quantity is being measured .",
    "that is , one formally has @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of this effect and show that it could become relevant for next generation redshift surveys such as desi or euclid .",
    "several authors thank kasi for hospitality during research visits .",
    "we especially thank atsushi taruya for many inputs and comments , and we thank seokcheon lee for reading the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us doe grant de - sc-0007867 and contract no .",
    "de - ac02 - 05ch11231 , and korea wcu grant r32 - 10130 and ewha womans university research fund 1 - 2008 - 2935 - 001 - 2 .",
    "numerical calculations were performed by using a high performance computing cluster in the korea astronomy and space science institute and we also thank the korea institute for advanced study for providing computing resources ( kias center for advanced computation linux cluster system ) .",
    "the transverse and radial distances extracted from the galaxy data do not in fact have the same @xmath12 , as the optimal weighting depends on the strength of clustering @xcite , enhanced along the line of sight by redshift space distortions [ e.g.  the usual kaiser factor @xmath128 .",
    "this is most familiar perhaps in the power spectrum , where the weighting @xmath129 $ ] shows that the higher power along the line of sight further deweights lower redshift galaxies where clustering has grown .",
    "this is a small effect , negligible for previous redshift surveys , but will become increasingly important for larger , more precise surveys .",
    "figure  [ fig : zeff ] calculates @xmath12 as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath130 , using the power spectrum computed from mock simulations relevant to boss @xcite .",
    "since most of the information for determining @xmath87 comes from radial modes @xmath131 and for determining @xmath0 comes from transverse modes @xmath132 , we see that the fit quantities are really @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath133 .",
    "this in turn would affect cosmological parameter estimation .    around @xmath134 , the hubble parameter scales in lcdm as @xmath135 so that @xmath136 .",
    "note that a survey that should use @xmath137 rather than 0.57 , say , due to the anisotropy of @xmath12 , would bias @xmath87 by @xmath138",
    ". this could be relevant for next generation surveys .",
    "since @xmath0 is extracted mostly from the transverse modes where the observed clustering is equal to the real space clustering , no shift should be needed in the conventional @xmath12 estimation .",
    "( for completeness we note that if @xmath137 rather than 0.57 then @xmath0 is biased high by 0.8% . ) for @xmath104 the 2d anisotropy dependence is more complicated ( see fig .",
    "4b of @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath139 is near its maximum at @xmath140 , so a change from @xmath6 has a very small effect on it ; in fact for @xmath137 the bias is only @xmath141 or @xmath142 .",
    "thus for current data precision the effect of different @xmath12 for different cosmological parameters is negligible .",
    "next generation galaxy redshift surveys such as desi or euclid , however , should adapt @xmath12 to the specific parameter being constrained .",
