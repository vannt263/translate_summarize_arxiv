    "the low ssfrs can be compared to the stellar mass loss from evolved stellar populations ( parriott & bregmann , 2008 ; leitner & kravtsov , 2010 ) .",

    "it overpredicts the ssfr from optical and near - ir sed fitting by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the discrepancy between the two values at each redshift tells us that one of the following options must hold true :    * a mechanism able to prevent the cooling of gas expelled from old stars and therefore the fueling of new star formation exists , _ or _ * sfrs from optical and near - ir best fitting are underestimated ( and a lot of star formation shows up in the mid - ir ) .",
    "in the rest of the paper we test the latter possibility measuring sfrs in the mid - ir , in order to prove the former .",
    "we evaluate how much star formation a galaxy can hide ( with high dust obscuration ) , while still retaining red optical - nir colors .",

    "strictly should be that the ir - inferred sfrs for qgs are upper limits , because of contributions of agns , agb stars and dust heating from old stellar populations to the ir fluxes .",

    "2008 ; kartaltepe et al .",
    "2010 ) have also already pointed out that systems with 24@xmath2 m flux dominated by agns are not the dominant population at low @xmath29 , such as qgs .",

    "we evaluate the contribution to @xmath29 with the new charlot & bruzual 2010 model ( cb2010 ) of an ssp with solar metallicity ( private communication ) . given galaxy ages from the fast best fits ( see section 2 , and whitaker et al .",
    "2013 , in press ) , for each galaxy in our qg sample we estimate the observed 24@xmath2 m flux from the cb2010 model and convert it to @xmath29 with the same relation of wuyts et al.(2008 ) ( figure 8 , right panel , orange line ) .",
    "another possible contribution to @xmath29 is dust heating from old stellar populations .",
    "salim et al . ( 2009 ) concludes that , for a sample of 24@xmath2m - detected galaxies in the deep2 survey ( 0.2 @xmath81 1.0 ) , the bulk of ir emission in red ( @xmath82 ) galaxies comes from the heating of diffuse cirrus dust by old stellar populations , rather than by dust heating in star - forming regions .",
    "we test if this holds true for the galaxies in our sample as follows .",
    "given the stellar population parameters from the fast best - fit to the seds ( age , @xmath53 , @xmath83 ) , we evaluate the luminosity absorbed at @xmath84 m by integrating the difference between the unattenuated and the attenuated synthetic sed , and assume it is re - emitted in the ir ( see charlot & fall 2000 , da cunha et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we then compare the model @xmath29 predicted by the attenuated sed with the best fit sfr .",

    "( 2005 ) relation ( black line ) , while for qgs @xmath29 are systematically higher than the expectations from sfr , meaning that for qgs most of dust heating comes from old stellar populations.,width=302 ]",
    "as we have seen above , various processes other than star formation can contribute to the observed mid - ir flux .",
    "we next discuss the impact on the derived sfrs .",
    "moreover , we put constraints on the mass growth of qgs implied by the measured sfrs and on their size growth implied by the stellar mass loss .    in figure [ evolution_ssfr ] ( right panel )",
    "we show the approximate evolution of @xmath86 , for data ( dashed lines ) and models ( thick solid lines ) .",
    "we saw earlier that observations of @xmath29 are based on the extrapolation of the single band 24@xmath2 m to @xmath87(ir ) assuming a template for dust heating by star - forming regions ( section 2 ) .",
    "model predictions estimate that the agn contribution ( gray line ) to the @xmath29 is negligible for our sample , while the model expectation for @xmath29 from cirrus dust ( green ) and circumstellar dust ( orange ) is comparable to the observed values from stacking .",
    "we note that qualitatively both of them decrease towards lower redshift , respectively because of higher @xmath83 and younger stellar ages at higher redshifts ( which leads to more absorbed optical light re - emitted in the ir in the younger universe ) and because of the aging of galaxies ( which leads to lower contribution of agb stars in the sed ) .",
    "if sfrs from sed fitting are correct , their contribution to @xmath29 ( black line in figure [ evolution_ssfr ] , right panel ) would be 1 dex lower than the observed @xmath29 , while dust heated by old stellar population can account for the most of the observed luminosities .",
    "all the measured values from 24@xmath2 m stacks must therefore be considered as upper limits to the sfr . at each redshift , the mean qg has a sfr at least @xmath720 - 40 times lower than that of a sfg at the same redshift .",
    "these sfrs are significantly higher than estimates based on optical and near - ir model fits ( see section 3 and ciambur , kauffman & wuyts 2013 ) .    in order to evaluate the growth of a qg via star formation we integrate the ssfr(ir)-z trend of figure 8 ( left )",
    "this leads to estimate that the @xmath88 growth of a qg via star formation is 20% from redshift 2 to 0 . some authors ( e.g. van dokkum et al . 2010 , patel et al .",
    "2012 ) have inferred that a present - day @xmath89 @xmath90 galaxy has to grow 60% of its mass from redshift @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "we show that star formation can not be responsible for the entire stellar growth of qgs , while other mechanisms must be in place , such as minor merging ( see , among others , hopkins 2009 ) .",
    "the limit we compute on the mass increase via star formation is more stringent than that computed by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who estimates that massive spheroid - like galaxies may have doubled ( at the most ) their stellar mass from redshift 2 to 0 .",
    "the sfrs expected from stellar mass loss are probably much higher than the real sfrs of qgs , meaning that star formation from mass loss is inefficient .",
    "if mass loss from evolved stars is not converted into stars and gas is expelled from the galaxy , an interesting consequence is that the potential of the system becomes shallower and the system expands ( zhao et al .",
    "2002 , murray et al .",
    "2010 ) . in brief",
    "( following damjanov et al . , 2009 ) , if a system loses a fraction @xmath93 of its mass in a time longer than a dynamical timescale , it will expand its radius by a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "the modeled mass losses for galaxies in our sample ( figure 4 ) integrated over the redshift range 0 to 2 give @xmath95 , which leads to @xmath96 .",
    "the observed size growth of quiescent galaxies from redshift 2 to 0 amounts to a factor of 2 - 3 ( e.g. williams et al .",
    "2010 , newman et al .",
    "2012 , whitaker et al .",
    "2012 ) , therefore mass loss can not be its unique cause but only one of the concurrent ones ( see also damjanov et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "we note that the assumed mass loss depends on the absolute ages of galaxies at each redshift , which are very uncertain .",
    "a possible caveat in the study comes from the fact that the 24@xmath2m - to - l(ir ) conversion relies on a single infrared template ( wuyts et al .",
    "2008 ) , while the underlying sed for high - redshift quiescent galaxies is unknown . as explained in section 2 ( data ) ,",
    "measuring the low fluxes of quiescent galaxies at herschel wavelengths is extremely challenging .",
    "available observationally motivated far - ir seds of galaxies at high redshift are based on bright herschel sources ( e.g. elbaz et al .",
    "2011 , magdis et al .",
    "2014 ) and refer to galaxies on or above the star - forming main sequence .",
    "we evaluate the possible bias introduced by our synthetic template by comparing the l(ir ) integrated under the elbaz et al .",
    "2011 sed for main - sequence galaxies to that inferred from a simulated 24@xmath2 m observation of that sed , at different redshifts .",
    "we obtain that at @xmath97 the inferred l(ir ) is a factor of 2 higher than the integrated l(ir ) , while at @xmath98 the bias is lower than 50% .    the possibility that galaxies below the main - sequence have different infrared sed shapes must however be taken into account ( see also utomo et al .",
    "2014 , hayward et al .",
    "we compute the systematic uncertainty on l(ir ) arising from the unknown underlying sed as follows .",
    "we compare the 24@xmath2m - to - lir conversion of wuyts et al .",
    "2008 , obtained by averaging a vast array of infrared templates from dale & helou 2002 , with those obtained by using each single dale & helou 2002 template for different values of the ionization parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the dispersion on the values is 0.3 dex , which we consider the systematic uncertainty on the conversion .",
    "we conclude that the possible biases and uncertainties induced by inferring l(ir ) from a single band and a single template amount to a factor of 2 , and do not affect the conclusions of the paper .",
    "we select quiescent galaxies at redshift @xmath99 in the 3d - hst survey from their rest - frame optical and near - ir colors . fitting their uv to near - ir photometry with stellar population models",
    ", we find very low star - formation rates ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "these values are much lower than the stellar mass loss rates predicted by the same models .",
    "this suggests that the star formation is either missed because it is dust obscured , or that the gas from stellar mass loss is expelled from the galaxy or prevented from refueling star formation .",
    "we put upper limits on the obscured star - formation rate of quiescent galaxies by stacking 24@xmath2 m images . including direct 24@xmath2 m detections , we find that @xmath100 . at each redshift",
    "the ssfr of quiescent galaxies is @xmath7 20 - 40 times lower than the typical value on the main sequence of star - forming galaxies .",
    "sfrs of quiescent galaxies are possibly even lower than this , because the ir luminosity can also be due to other sources , such as the presence of agb dust enshrouded stars and dust heating from older stellar populations .",
    "stacks of longer wavelength data ( such as from _ herschel _ ) are necessary for constraining the dust temperature and therefore distinguishing between the different contributions to @xmath29 , however a large sample may be necessary to achieve adequate s / n ( e.g. viero et al .",
    "we show nevertheless that dust heating from old stellar populations can account for most of the observed @xmath29 .",
    "the observed sfr(ir ) are therefore upper limits to the real sfr , which are possibly one order of magnitude lower .",
    "this means that there must be a mechanism that not only shuts down star formation , but also keeps the galaxy dead for a long period of time , preventing the ejected gas from cooling and forming new stars .",
    "if gas from mass - loss is expelled from galaxies , we predict that it is responsible for a growth in stellar radii of 60% from redshift 2 to 0 .",
