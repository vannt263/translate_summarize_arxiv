    "one stage of the low mass star formation paradigm has yet to be observed : the first core or first hydrostatic core ( fhsc ) . during this brief phase between the initiation of core collapse and the appearance of a `` true '' protostar ,",
    "the growing central core of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) is heated to the point at which it obtains hydrostatic balance .",
    "when the central temperature of the first core reaches approximately 2000  k , the h@xmath3 is dissociated and a second collapse forms the true protostar .",
    "the fhsc has long been expected from theory @xcite , but has not yet been observationally verified .",
    "@xcite recently presented a promising candidate , l1448 irs2e , based on detection of a co outflow without a corresponding mid - infrared source . the observed outflow is faster than would be expected for a typical fhsc @xcite , but might be consistent with the very end of the fhsc phase .",
    "the expected effective temperature of the fhsc , which has a radius of several au , is approximately 100  k ; as the majority of this cool emission is absorbed and re - radiated by the even cooler envelope , the emergent spectrum of the fhsc is very similar to that of a starless core .",
    "the strongest observational signature is likely to be an increase in luminosity for @xmath4 as compared to starless cores @xcite .",
    "furthermore , given the expected short lifetime of the fhsc ( @xmath5 yr ; @xcite ) , there should only be a few observable even in large samples of cores and protostars . based on the relative lifetimes of the fhsc and true protostars ( @xmath6 yr ; @xcite ) , we expect only one fhsc for every 18 to 540 protostars . before large _ spitzer _",
    "surveys such as the `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' legacy program ( `` cores to disks '' or c2d ; @xcite ) , the number of known protostars in any given region was typically too low to expect even one fhsc .",
    "we have recently completed a census of starless cores and embedded protostars in the perseus , serpens , and ophiuchus molecular clouds @xcite , based on large - scale bolocam 1.1  mm continuum surveys @xcite and irac and mips maps from c2d @xcite .",
    "perseus , serpens , and ophiuchus each harbor between 30 and 70 embedded protostars  objects after the second collapse , and thus more evolved than fhscs , but still embedded in and accreting from their natal cores  and should contain at least a few fhscs ( if the lifetime is longer than @xmath7 yr ) . _",
    "spitzer _ was sufficiently sensitive to detect @xmath0 emission from a 0.015  fhsc at a distance of 250  pc @xcite , but large surveys such as c2d were not deep enough at @xmath0 to detect the fhsc .",
    "in this letter , we present new deep _ spitzer _ mips observations that reveal a candidate fhsc in the perseus molecular cloud . utilizing literature data",
    ", we compare the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and millimeter visibilities of this source to radiative transfer models of a fhsc and very low luminosity protostar .",
    "figure  [ predictfig ] shows the expected observed sed of a fhsc , from the radiative transfer models of @xcite .",
    "based on these models , an unambiguous detection of the fhsc requires detection of compact @xmath0 emission in a dense core with no emission at @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 sensitivity limit of the c2d survey was approximately 75 mjy ( @xmath10 ) , somewhat higher than the flux expected for a typical fhsc @xcite .",
    "thus any fhscs appeared as starless cores in our census , and deeper @xmath0 follow - up observations were necessary to reveal them . but found no such objects . ]",
    "we selected targets from our census of starless cores @xcite , which includes 108 cores and is complete to @xmath11 , based on three criteria .",
    "( 1 ) visual inspection of the c2d @xmath0 maps at starless core positions , looking for faint emission below the formal @xmath10 detection limit .",
    "( 2 ) starless cores with mass - to - size ratios above the critical value for stable bonnor - ebert spheres ( central to surface density ratio @xmath12 , or m [ @xmath13/fwhm [ pc ] @xmath14 for @xmath15  k ) .",
    "these cores are likely to be collapsing , but the lack of near- or mid - infrared emission indicates that they have not yet formed a true protostar .",
    "( 3 ) spatially compact starless cores , either unresolved by the @xmath16 bolocam beam or compact in follow - up carma 2.9  mm interferometric maps ( enoch et al . , in prep ) . again",
    ", these cores have high central density and may be collapsing .    in the three clouds",
    ", 7 starless cores met one or more of the above criteria .",
    "this is by no means a complete or unbiased sample ; rather , we used these criteria to identify interesting objects for deeper follow - up observations .",
    "deep @xmath0 maps of our 7 targets were obtained with the multi - band imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite during 2008 october 20 - october 27 .",
    "integration times ranged between @xmath17 s pixel@xmath18 , depending on the brightness of the background estimated from c2d maps .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 detection limit of @xmath19  mjy was chosen based on the models of @xcite , to detect fhscs with mass @xmath20 at the distance of perseus and serpens ( @xmath21  pc ) .",
    "data were reduced using the c2d pipeline @xcite .",
    "one source was clearly detected at @xmath0 : [ eyg2006 ] bolo  58 ( ra=03 29 25.7 , dec=+31 28 16.3 ) , hereafter per - bolo  58 , a dense core identified as starless by both @xcite and @xcite . per - bolo  58",
    "was included in our target list based on faint emission in the c2d @xmath0 map and a spatially compact 1.1  mm core .",
    "it is located in the outskirts of the ngc  1333 young cluster ( see figure  [ mapfig ] , right ) .",
    "the @xmath0 flux of per - bolo  58 is @xmath22  mjy .",
    "a subsequent search of the c2d deep catalogs @xcite revealed a low signal - to - noise @xmath1 detection at the position of per - bolo  58 , with a flux of @xmath23  mjy .",
    "this source was not included in the `` high reliability '' or `` yso candidate '' c2d catalogs , as it did not meet the @xmath24 signal - to - noise requirement . given the good positional correspondence and point - like emission , we believe the @xmath1 source is associated with per - bolo  58 .",
    "there is also a nearby low signal - to - noise @xmath25 detection ( @xmath26 mjy ) that we do not believe is associated , as the only point - like emission is offset by @xmath27 from the @xmath1 and @xmath0 sources .",
    "we treat the @xmath25 point as an upper limit .",
    "we estimate a @xmath28 flux of 2.8  jy from the c2d mips @xmath28 map ; this value has a large uncertainty ( @xmath29% ) due to non - uniform extended emission in ngc  1333 . _",
    "spitzer _ images at @xmath30 , and @xmath28 are shown in figure  [ mapfig ] .",
    "all known continuum fluxes for per - bolo  58 are given in table  [ fluxtab ] , and the observed sed is shown in figure  [ predictfig ] .",
    "in addition to the _ spitzer _ data described above , we include sharc ii @xmath31 ( dunham et al .",
    ", in prep ) , scuba @xmath32 @xcite , and bolocam 1.1  mm @xcite fluxes , as well as the carma 2.9  mm map from @xcite .",
    "the interferometric carma 2.9  mm map provides both a long wavelength flux measurement and a measure of the resolved radial intensity profile .",
    "the 2.9  mm visibility amplitudes versus @xmath33-distance are shown in figures  [ fit1fig ] and [ fit2fig ] .",
    "our @xmath0 detection of per - bolo  58 indicates the presence of an internal luminosity source in this dense core , with a flux consistent with that expected for a fhsc .",
    "the detection at @xmath1 is inconsistent with a fhsc surrounded by a spherically symmetric envelope , however ( figure  [ predictfig ] ) , leaving open the possibility that per - bolo  58 may be a very low luminosity protostar .",
    "we discuss these possibilities below .",
    "we use radmc , a two - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code @xcite to model a fhsc and low luminosity protostar .",
    "we adopt a density profile that includes a rotating infalling envelope characterized by total mass , centrifugal radius , and outer radius  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and outflow cavity characterized by full opening angle @xmath34 .",
    "the envelope mass is held fixed at @xmath35 , as calculated from the 1.1  mm flux ( see @xcite ) assuming a dust temperature of @xmath36  k , consistent with radiative transfer models of such a low luminosity source .",
    "details of the density profile and modeling are as in @xcite .",
    "dust opacities are from table 1 , column 5 of @xcite for dust grains with thin ice mantles , including scattering .",
    "following @xcite , we remove the effects of excess back - scattering of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) by subtracting the flux for a starless core model at short wavelengths .",
    "@xcite make this correction for @xmath37 ; here we additionally include the small plateau of isrf emission at @xmath38 . while this correction affects the shape of our model seds at short wavelengths , the correction at @xmath1 is small",
    ", so it does not significantly affect the model fits .    to match the peak of the sed at @xmath39 we include an isrf that is a factor of 3 stronger than the `` black - draine '' isrf @xcite .",
    "a more intense radiation field may be expected in ngc 1333 , where there is significant extended emission at @xmath40 ( e.g. figure  [ mapfig ] ) .",
    "increasing the isrf improves the overall fit of all models , but does not change the best - fitting envelope parameters , because the sed peak depends primarily on fixed parameters ( , isrf ) .",
    "our fhsc models include a cool ( @xmath41  k ) , large ( @xmath42  au , where the actual radius is determined from @xmath43 ) internal luminosity source .",
    "we run a grid of models varying  ( 0.006 , 0.012 , 0.025 ) ,  ( 4000 , 6000 , 8000 , 10000  au ) ,  ( 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 300  au ) ,  ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60  @xmath44 ) , and inclination (; 5 , 10 , 15 ... 90  @xmath44 ) .    models are compared to the observed sed of per - bolo  58 using a @xmath45 analysis to constrain , , , and .",
    "an internal luminosity of @xmath46 is clearly preferred by the sed , and we derive other parameters with  fixed .",
    "the sed is rather insensitive to , so we also compute the visibility amplitudes of each model as a function of @xmath33-distance , and compare to the 2.9  mm carma observations from @xcite . at small @xmath33-distances ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "the visibilities are sensitive to the spatial extent of the envelope ( see @xcite for more details ) , and we find a best fit for @xmath48  au .",
    "the best fitting fhsc model ( @xmath49 , @xmath41  k , @xmath50  au , @xmath51  au , @xmath48  au , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) is compared to the observed sed and 2.9  mm visibilities in figure  [ fit1fig ] . another well - fitting model with @xmath54  au and @xmath55",
    "is also shown .",
    "a number of models have similar @xmath45 values , but all have either an envelope cavity ( @xmath56  au ) or an outflow ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "models without an envelope cavity are clearly unable to match the observed @xmath1 point , due to the high opacity through the envelope ; such a model with @xmath54  au and @xmath52 is shown in figure  [ fit1fig ] for comparison .",
    "although an envelope cavity is not expected from simple physical models of the fhsc , in which the envelope extends down to the fhsc and no outflow is present , there are several cases in which we might expect a cavity .",
    "mhd calculations have shown that the fhsc can drive a molecular outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such early outflows should be weak , but could evacuate enough envelope material to allow a small amount of @xmath1 flux to escape .",
    "similarly , a larger centrifugal radius might be expected if the inner envelope were cleared by a binary source or weak outflow .",
    "we note that @xmath25 is the _",
    "band associated with shock emission in outflows , and the nearby weak @xmath25 emission could be tracing a weak outflow .",
    "a number of dense cores previously believed to be starless were found by _",
    "spitzer _ to harbor very low luminosity objects ( vellos ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the best current explanation of vellos is that they are true protostars , but with low internal luminosities due either to very low masses or very low accretion rates .",
    "most vellos have internal luminosities between @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite ; although the @xmath60 and @xmath0 fluxes of per - bolo  58 are lower than typical vellos , it may be an extreme example of a low luminosity protostellar population .",
    "at least two other protostellar sources with similar luminosities are known : a candidate embedded proto - brown dwarf in taurus with @xmath61 ( sstb213 j041757 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and cha - mms  1 , which has an estimated internal luminosity of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "to model per - bolo  58 as a protostar , we use a similar grid as above , but include a hot internal luminosity source typical of a true protostar ( @xmath63  k , @xmath64 ) . the best fitting protostar model ( @xmath49 , @xmath51  au , @xmath48  au , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is shown in figure  [ fit2fig ] .",
    "protostar models with relatively high inclinations ( @xmath67 ) are nearly indistinguishable from the corresponding fhsc models ; in both cases essentially all of the emission from the central source is reprocessed by the envelope , masking the details of the internal luminosity source .",
    "we can rule out protostar models with low inclinations , however , which produce far too much emission in the near - infrared .",
    "again , an internal luminosity of 0.012  is strongly favored .",
    "this value is corroborated by the relationship between internal luminosity and observed @xmath0 flux determined by @xcite : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the flux ( in erg  @xmath70  s@xmath18 ) at 140  pc . for per - bolo  58",
    "this relationship yields @xmath71 .",
    "if per - bolo  58 is a true protostar then it is one of the lowest luminosity embedded protostars known , with @xmath72 .",
    "we are currently unable to conclusively determine the evolutionary state of per - bolo  58 .",
    "while the herschel gould belt survey @xcite will further refine the sed , additional observations are needed to distinguish a fhsc with a small envelope cavity from an extremely low luminosity protostar .",
    "possible observational tests include measuring the outflow velocity and finding evidence of water ice evaporation .",
    "numerical mhd models suggest that the fhsc can drive a molecular outflow , but with quite low velocity ( @xmath73  km  s@xmath18 ; @xcite ) . as protostellar outflows typically have speeds of @xmath74  km  s@xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , detecting an outflow and measuring its velocity , either in the millimeter or with herschel spectroscopy , could test our hypothesis that per - bolo  58 is a fhsc .",
    "no outflow was detected in the harp @xmath75co ( 3 - 2 ) study of @xcite , but a fhsc outflow should be below their detection criteria ( linewing strength above 1.5  k at 3  km  s@xmath18 from the core velocity ) .    unlike the fhsc , for which the maximum dust temperature in the envelope is only @xmath76  k , temperatures in our protostar models are high enough in the inner few au ( up to 300  k ) to evaporate water ice ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alma is capable of detecting the resulting h@xmath3o or hdo lines , around 300  ghz and 240  ghz , even with the beam dilution of an @xmath77 ( 20  au at 250  pc ) beam . given the outflow non - detection at the level expected for a typical protostar , finding chemical signatures indicative of high gas temperatures may be the best way to rule out per - bolo  58 as a fhsc .",
    "in an effort to observationally verify the theoretically predicted fhsc phase , we have obtained deep _ spitzer _ @xmath0 images of a small sample of dense starless cores . per - bolo  58",
    "is detected at the level expected for the fhsc , making it a very promising fhsc candidate .",
    "a weak detection at @xmath1 leaves open the possibility that it might be an extremely low luminosity protostar , however .",
    "we are able to reproduce the observed sed and 2.9 mm visibilities of per - bolo  58 with radiative transfer models of a fhsc , although some source of lower envelope opacity allowing @xmath1 emission to escape is required : either a small outflow cavity or a spherical cavity in the envelope of @xmath29  au . while we can not rule out the possibility that per - bolo  58 has already formed a true protostar , with an internal luminosity @xmath78 it would be one of the lowest luminosity protostars known .",
    "additional observational tests to clarify the evolutionary state of per - bolo  58 include measuring the velocity of any outflow present , and looking for evidence of water ice evaporation in the inner few au .",
    "finally , we note that if per - bolo  58 is a true fhsc , then its observational similarity to vellos ( which are defined by luminosity alone ) suggests that some vellos currently thought to be protostellar might in fact be members of the fhsc phase .",
