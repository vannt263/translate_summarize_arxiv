    "the scattering of an unpolarized electron beam at a likewise unpolarized target leads to a separation of electrons with different spins @xcite .",
    "the reason for that effect is the spin - orbit interaction originated by relativistic corrections to the schrdinger equation of the order @xmath0 . as a consequence an electric current in a semiconductor should be accompanied by a spin current perpendicular to the conventional current of the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "the generation of a transverse spin current due to an external electric field called as spin hall effect @xcite has attracted much attention recently particularly for realizing spintronic devises @xcite . in a series of experiments",

    "recently the spin hall conductivity was measured at room temperature @xcite , an observation which give the motivation for the present paper .",
    "the transport process is considered as a thermally activated process which is additionally driven by the applied electric field .",
    "this field however reveals a direct coupling to the crystal potential in such a manner that also in case of a periodic potential a constant current is maintained .",
    "our approach is based on the fokker - planck equation or kramers equation for the semiclassical motion of the charge carriers with damping and coupling to a stochastic source like a heat bath .",
    "thus the charged particles can overcome permanently , but with a certain probability , potential barriers .",
    "even for low temperature one should take into account the coupling of the homogeneous electric field to the potential landscape . actually as discussed below the averaged force acting on the particles",
    "consists of several parts which point at different directions and contribute to the total conductivity .",
    "recently a very promising theory has been proposed @xcite by studying the semi - classical deterministic equation of motion .",
    "the theoretical approach describing the spin halle effect goes back to @xcite where a mesoscopic equation for the spin density had been proposed . a more phenomenological approach based on an anomalous scattering mechanism in the absence of spin - flip scattering discussed in @xcite . as a consequence anomalous currents and",
    "a finite spin - diffusion length had been studied in @xcite where the calculations are based on the boltzmann equation . in a series of papers @xcite a quantum approach for",

    "+ in the present paper we consider an extension of the theoretical approach proposed in @xcite by including systematically a coupling to stochastic forces and friction terms . because we are in the linear response regime the canonical friction and the strength of the stochastic force",
    "are related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the steady state solution of kramers equation is an appropriate tool to obtain the electrical current . as a novelty",
    "we discuss in detail the influence of the underlying crystal potential . unlike @xcite we get corrections to the spin hall conductivity by the averaged crystal potential .",
    "because the mean value over the crystal potential is performed with the stationary solution of kramers equation and this solution depends on the electric field there occur additional corrections to the conductivity in both the linear response regime with respect to the field @xmath1 and in lowest order @xmath0 of an relativistic approach .",

    "it is important to note that all averages performed with @xmath26 depends on the electric field @xmath1 , too . because we are looking for a solution linear in the relativistic factor @xmath34",
    "we consider firstly the non - relativistic case @xmath35 . from eq .",

    "we get @xmath36 since in the non - relativistic case , @xmath37 the system offers only one preferential direction , namely that one given by the external field @xmath1 , and furthermore the distribution function of the steady state depends on the electric field , the only possibility is that the averaged force in eq .",

    "apart from the thermal activation process as driving force the conventional drude current is already supplemented by a correction term due to the crystal potential , see @xmath53 in eq .  .",

    "let us estimate the correction coefficients @xmath55 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is originated by the distribution of charge carriers in a cubic lattice . following",
    "the line proposed in @xcite one can estimate the coefficient @xmath42 using the poisson equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the local charge density of the ions .",
    "this gives @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the charge and @xmath60 is the concentration of the ions . let us notice that the result is correct in linear order of the external field . using the approach proposed below one can show that corrections to the parameter @xmath42 due to the field @xmath1 occur at first in second order .",

    "the influence of the homogeneous field @xmath1 on the potential is manifested by the explicit field dependence of the steady state solution @xmath62 . as a direct consequence",
    "the averaged force carried on the charge particles via the crystal potential , depends on @xmath1 according to eq .  .",
    "owing to the pure spatial dependence of the crystal potential the reduced distribution function , defined by @xmath63 seems to be a more appropriate quantity as @xmath26 .",

    "we conclude @xmath71 in lowest oder of a relativistic approach there is no current in spin direction . inserting this result in eq .",
    "one obtains that the ratio of the spin hall conductivity and the charge conductivity is independent on the lattice potential @xmath72 this expression differs from that obtained in @xcite by a factor 2 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that in @xcite the field dependence of the averaged crystal potential is neglected .",
    "the spin and the charge current is subjected to the same scattering mechanism by the underlying isotropic crystal potential .",

    "we find in @xmath73 dimensions @xmath74 notice that the result is valid in first order of @xmath34 and in the linear response regime .",
    "so the problem in finding out the influence of the crystal potential is reduced to calculate the mean square displacement according to eq .  .",
