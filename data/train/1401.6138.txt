    "<S> the measurements reported here were motivated by the attempt to study the isospin decomposition of 2n - src as a proxy to a transition from primarily tensor to the short range repulsive , presumably scalar , nucleon - nucleon force . in the ground state of @xmath11  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the number of @xmath18-src pairs is much smaller than @xmath16-src pairs for values of the relative nucleon momentum @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the correlations induced by the tensor force are strongly suppressed for @xmath18 pairs which are predominantly in @xmath106 state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the relative momenta increase , the tensor force becomes less dominant , the role played by the short - range repulsive force increases and with it the ratio of @xmath107 pairs . in our measurement , as the missing momenta is increased beyond 500   @xmath6 , the triple coincidence @xmath11(e , e^pp ) @xmath20/ @xmath11(e , e^pn ) @xmath21   ratio increases , in good agreement with the prediction based on the ratio of @xmath18-src/@xmath16-src pairs in the @xmath11  ground state @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the measured @xmath11(e , e^pp ) @xmath20/ @xmath11(e , e^p ) @xmath5  ratio reflects a small contribution from @xmath18-src pairs . these pairs are likely dominated by a scalar repulsive short - range force which is relatively constant over the reported momentum range .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11(e , e^pn ) @xmath21/ @xmath11(e , e^p ) @xmath5  ratio clearly shows that the reduction in the @xmath16/@xmath18 ratio with increasing @xmath85 is due to a drop in @xmath16-src pairs with increasing @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath16-pairs still dominate two nucleon src , even at missing momentum of 800 @xmath6 the total fraction of the ( e , e^p ) @xmath5  cross section associated with scattering from 2n - src pairs drops with increasing missing momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely due to an increase of more complex mechanisms , such as stronger fsi and the onset of src involving more than two nucleons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a definitive understanding of the relative importance of these effects requires exclusive measurements at large missing momentum on heavier nuclei , and a more detailed theoretical study .    to summarize , the short range part of the @xmath8 force is empirically known to be repulsive , it is essential to describe @xmath8 scattering and stability of nuclei , but it is difficult to explore and poorly known both theoretically and experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements reported here probe a transition from an attractive to a repulsive @xmath8 force . the data set , interpreted as changes in the isospin decomposition of the src pairs , is consistent with a reduced contribution from a tensor component and a constant contribution from a scalar component of the @xmath8 force over the probed missing momentum range . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms the phenomenological description of the @xmath8 force in this range .    </S>",
    "<S> one should question to what level the naive interpretation of the data in terms of the ground state nuclear properties is appropriate . </S>",
