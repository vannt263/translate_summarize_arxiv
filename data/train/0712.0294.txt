    "nuga project @xcite is a combined effort to undertake a high resolution ( 1@xmath0 - 2@xmath0 ) and high - sensitivity co survey , made with the plateau de bure iram interferometer , for a sample of nearby agn spirals . + for the galaxy ngc 3147 , after merging the interferometer data with the short spacing observations done with the iram-30 m , we find that a nuclear peak and two molecular rings or pseudo - rings ( at r @xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 2 kpc and r @xmath220@xmath3 @xmath4 4 kpc , respectively ) dominate the co(1 - 0 ) map , while in the co(2 - 1 ) we detect a peak of emission in the nucleus and a single and central ring at r @xmath210@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "fig . [ fig2 ] shows that the molecular gas distribution has partial counterparts at wavelengths tracing the star formation , e.g. infrared emission ( spitzer ) and ultraviolet one ( galex ) .",
    "using a nir image obtained at the canada - france - hawaii telescope , we identify the presence of a bar in ngc 3147 classified as non - barred galaxy in the optical .",
    "computing the gravity torques from this stellar bar , we find that the gas in the main central co pseudo - ring is subject to a dominant negative torque and loses angular momentum . on the contrary ,",
    "the gas in spiral arms forming the external pseudo - ring suffers positive torques and is driven outwards .",
    "we conclude that some molecular gas is presently inflowing to the center , and probably feeding the low - luminosity seyfert 2 observed in ngc 3147 ( see * ? ? ?",
