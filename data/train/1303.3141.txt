    "this with a polynomial function of time is not efficient in many cases . here",
    "we present the effect of these special moving feature , and we define direction dependent underlying variables .",
    "we use them to fit a general multidimensional linear function for the background .",
    "note that here we give a short summary of the method and some preliminary results .",
    "the detailed description of the direction dependent background fitting ( ddbf ) algorithm and the final results will be published soon @xcite .",
    "fermi s slewing algorithm is quite complex .",
    "it is designed to optimize the observation of the gamma - ray sky . in sky survey mode , the satellite rocks around the zenith within @xmath0 , and the pointing alternates between the northern and southern hemispheres each orbit @xcite . in autonomous repoint request ( arr ) mode",
    ", it turns toward the burst and stays there for hours .",
    "12 nai detectors are placed such a way that the entire hemisphere is observable with them at the same time .",
    "the gbm data , which we use in our analysis ( called ctime ) , are available at 8 energy channels , with @xmath1-second for triggered and @xmath2-second resolution for non - triggered mode .",
    "the position data is available in @xmath3-second resolution .",
    "this data were evenly proportioned to @xmath4-second and @xmath1-second bins using linear interpolation , in order to correspond to the ctime data @xcite .    using gbm data , 1-second bins and summarizing the counts in the channels between 11.50982.23 kev",
    ", one can plot a gbm lightcurve as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc.eps ] .",
    "analyzing ancillary spacecraft and other directional data we have found the following @xmath5 variables , which seem to contribute to the variation of the background : celestial distance between burst and detector orientation , celestial distance between sun and detector orientation , rate of the earth - uncovered sky and time @xcite .",
    "we use the method of general least square for multidimensional fitting of the @xmath6 counts to the corresponding @xmath7 explanatory variables .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters @xmath8 is obtained by minimizing the quantity of + @xmath9    the matrix of @xmath10 and vector @xmath11 are : @xmath12    minimizing @xmath13 leads us to the following equation : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 means the transpose of @xmath16 , and the expression @xmath17 are called _ generalized inverse _ or _ pseudoinverse _ of @xmath16 . for calculating the pseudoinverse of the design matrix @xmath16 we used singular value decomposition ( svd ) : @xmath18 . using @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the pseudoinverse of @xmath16 can be obtained as @xmath21    since we want to have a method for all the fermi bursts , we define our model to be quite comprehensive .",
    "let us have @xmath22 as the function of @xmath23 of order 3 , so the basis functions @xmath24 ( and columns of the design matrix ) consist of every possible products of the components @xmath25 up to order 3 .",
    "that means that we have @xmath26 basis functions and @xmath27 , @xmath28 ... @xmath29 free parameters .",
    "it is sure that we do not need so many free parameters to describe a simple background .",
    "computing the pseudoinverse we need the reciprocal of the singular values in the diagonals of @xmath30 , but if we compute the pseudoinverse of @xmath16 , the reciprocals of the tiny and not important singular values will be unreasonably huge and enhance the numerical roundoff errors as well .",
    "this problem can be solved defining a _",
    "value , below which reciprocals of singular values are set to zero @xcite .",
    "one cornerstone of the fitting algorithm described above is the definition of the boundaries which divide the interval of the burst and the intervals of the background . in this work ,",
    "we follow the common method of using user - selected time intervals @xcite .",
    "but unlike @xcite , using the position data allows us to fit the total ctime file instead of selecting two small intervals around the burst @xcite .",
    "the akaike information criterion ( aic ) is a commonly used method of choosing the right model to the data @xcite .",
    "assume that we have @xmath31 models so that the @xmath32th model has @xmath32 free parameters ( @xmath33 ) . when the deviations of the observed values from the model are normally and independently distributed , every model has a value aic@xmath34 so that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the residual sum of squares from the estimated model ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the sample size and @xmath32 is the number of free parameters to be estimated . given any two estimated models , the model with the lower value of aic@xmath34 is the one to be preferred .",
    "given many , the one with lowest aic@xmath34 will be the best choice : it has as many free parameters as it has to have , but not more .",
    "we loop over the pseudoinverse operation and choose @xmath39 as the limit of singular values in the @xmath32th step , and compute the corresponding aic@xmath34 .",
    "the number of singular values which minimalize the aic@xmath34 as a function of @xmath32 will be the best choice when calculating the pseudoinverse @xcite .",
    "as an example we analyze the lightcurve of grb  090113778 .",
    "grb  090113 is a long burst with t@xmath40=17.408@xmath413.238 s in the gbm catalogue , here we show detector 0 data :            fig .",
    "[ fig:100130777 ] has some extra counts around 400 and 600 seconds .",
    "both of them can be explained with the variation of the underlying variables , that is , the motion of the satellite .",
    "these are not grb signals !",
    "the ddbf method is too complicated to give a simple expression for the error of @xmath42 using general rules of error propagation .",
    "we therefore repeated the process for 1000 mc simulated data .",

    "the first peak at 22 seconds corresponds to the measured @xmath42 value .",
    "however , in some cases of the poison noise simulation , the measured @xmath42 value is systematically longer : that is because this burst has a little pulse around 47 seconds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc.eps ] . ) .",

    "we summarized the direction dependent background fitting ( ddbf ) algorithm which is designed to filter the background of the fermi lightcurves on a longer timescale ( 2000 seconds of the ctime datafile ) .",
    "this technique is based on the motion and orientation of the satellite .",
    "the ddbf considers the position of the burst , the sun and the earth as well .",
    "based on these position information , we computed three physically meaningful underlying variables , and fitted a 4 dimensional hypersurface on the background . singular value decomposition and akaike information criterion was used to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "one of the main advantage of the ddbf method is that it considers only variables with physical meaning .",
    "furthermore , this method can fit the total 2000 sec ctime data as opposed to the currently used methods .",
    "this features are necessary when analyzing long grbs and precursors , where motion effects influence the background rate sometimes in a very extreme way",
    ". therefore , not only sky survey , but arr mode grb s can be analyzed , and a possible long emission can be detected .",
