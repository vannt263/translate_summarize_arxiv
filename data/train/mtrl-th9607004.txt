    "the surface electronic structure of a metal plays a central role in the surface chemistry that takes place upon it .",
    "that is , the surface electronic structure of a metal is central to its chemical reactivity .",
    "it has long been understood that in the transition metals in particular , the @xmath1 electrons dominate their chemistry . more recently",
    ", computational studies of chemisorption and dissociation on various metals and alloys have clarified how they do so @xcite .",
    "thus , one can state with confidence that the surface chemical reactivity of a transition metal depends strongly on the response of its surface @xmath1 electrons to the external perturbations imposed by an atom or molecule with which it interacts . a generic measure of its reactivity",
    "should then be provided by their response to a generic perturbation .",
    "one very simple generic perturbation is provided by the difference in environment between surface and bulk .",
    "thus , a shift in some suitable feature of the @xmath1 band structure between surface and bulk could provide a suitable generic measure of reactivity .",
    "the structure of the occupied portion of the @xmath1 band could be studied experimentally by photoelectron spectroscopy , and the shift in the peaks of the spectrum from surface to bulk could be detected .",
    "this measure of the surface @xmath1 band shift ( sdbs ) is somewhat ambiguous because of broadening and the role of matrix elements .",
    "a sharply defined measure is the shift in the center of gravity of the @xmath1 band , @xmath5 , or    @xmath6    another sharply defined measure would be the shift in the relevant matrix element of the kohn - sham hamiltonian ; how to model this is discussed in sec .",
    "a recent development which is very interesting is that the differences between the core - electron binding energies of surface atoms of supported metal monolayers on transition - metal substrates and of surface atoms of the clean elemental crystal surface ( the latter consisting of the element forming the adlayer ) are strongly correlated with the corresponding shift in the center of gravity of the surface @xmath1 band @xcite .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the core - level shifts tend to correlate with the adlayer s chemical reactivity and that this could be understood through the correlation with the surface @xmath1 band shift @xcite .",
    "the scls s and the sdbs s arise from the surface potential shift experienced by the core states and the @xmath1 states , respectively .",
    "both represent different spatial samplings of the same potential shift ; thus the existence of the observed correlation is not surprising .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative test of the correlation and a deeper and more detailed understanding of its origin . in sec .",
    "ii , we report the results of scls calculations for the @xmath2 transition metals and for sr and ag .",
    "we also demonstrate an excellent quasilinear correlation between the computed scls values and those of the sdbs s .",
    "indeed , the scls values nearly equal the sdbs values in the initial - state approximation . to demonstrate that this correlation is robust , holding for other measures of the sps",
    ", we extract values of that shift for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 subbands at the center of the surface brillouin zone by fitting the computed bands to a simple model in sec .",
    "the correlation is found to persist .",
    "the two most prominent features of the results in sec .",
    "ii and iii are ( _ i _ ) the quasilinear correlation between the scls s and the sdbs s and ( _ ii _ ) the sign change which occurs across the @xmath2 series .",
    "understanding ( _ i _ ) requires less depth of analysis than understanding ( _ ii _ ) .",
    "accordingly , we present in sec .",
    "iv plots of the @xmath0 core - orbital density and the @xmath2 valence - orbital density overlaid upon the sps which make clear that the sampling argument referred above is valid . on the other hand , to understand ( _ ii _ ) fully requires probing more deeply into the origin of the sps than is done in the usual surface @xmath1-band - narrowing argument . in sec .",
    "v we provide such an analysis of the origin of the sps via a decomposition of the sps into its component parts together with a decomposition of the electron - density changes @xmath9 responsible for it . in the process , we confirm the essential correctness of the band - narrowing argument .",
    "the resulting improved understanding of the sps and @xmath9 is our most significant contribution .",
    "we discuss our results briefly in sec .",
    "we have considered the fcc(001 ) surfaces of the @xmath2 transition metals and of sr and ag and have calculated the scls s , @xmath10 , for the @xmath0 levels .",
    "all calculations have been done for the fcc(001 ) structure to facilitate intercomparison and the establishment of trends , irrespective of whether fcc is the equilibrium structure .    using slater s transition - state concept @xcite to evaluate total - energy differences ,",
    "@xmath10 can be estimated from    @xmath11\\quad , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the kohn - sham eigenvalues of a particular core state of a surface or bulk atom , and @xmath14 is the occupation number of the core - orbital . in the initial - state approximation , the scls s",
    "are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath15 .",
    "the electron density , core - electron eigenvalues , and densities of states are calculated by means of an efficient surface - greens - function technique based on the tight - binding , all - electron linear muffin - tin orbital theory within the local density approximation ( lda ) of the exchange - correlation functional in the ceperley and alder form @xcite as parametrized by perdew and zunger @xcite .",
    "the details of the method have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the potentials are calculated selfconsistently within the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) in an intermediate region consisting of the surface layer , three substrate layers , and two layers of empty spheres simulating the vacuum - sample interface .",
    "this intermediate region is coupled to the semi - infinite vacuum on one side and to the semi - infinite crystal on the other , with frozen potentials .",
    "calculations are performed for sphere radii chosen so as to minimize the total energy of the bulk in the fcc structure .",
    "no relaxation of the topmost layers has been assumed ; all interatomic distances in the surface layer , as well as between surface and substrate layers are assumed to be the same and equal to those in the substrate . to describe the transition - state",
    "[ eq1 ] ) , selfconsistent electronic structure calculations are performed under the constraint of charge neutrality .",
    "the single impurity problem of the localized core - hole with half an electron missing in the @xmath0 shell can be easily treated within the surface green s function formalism .",
    "the charge neutrality constraint within this scheme results in a nearly fully relaxed final state , i.e. , that the valence charge of the excited single impurity nearly equals ( z+0.5)@xmath16 ( z atomic number ) . in table [ table1 ] we compare three of our calculated shifts with independent first - principles calculations , which include final - state effects to some approximation , and with available experimental data . a number of other calculations for the most close - packed surfaces @xcite have achieved a similar degree of agreement between experiment and theory using similar but not identical computational methods .",
    "we have also calculated the lmto potential parameters @xmath17 @xcite , which correlate closely with the center of gravity of the @xmath1 band , @xmath5 , for both bulk and surface and have constructed the sdbs s from them according to eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) @xmath18 .",
    "the calculated initial - state and final - state core - level shifts for the fcc(001 ) surfaces of the @xmath2 transition metals plotted vs. these calculated sdbs s are presented in fig .",
    "note the near linearity of the correlation between the initial scls s and the sdbs s .",
    "the smaller screening contributions to the shifts , which are related to the downward shifts of the core - levels when deoccupied leave the overall linear correlation largely unaffected .",
    "we have somewhat arbitrarily selected the sdbs as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) as the generic measure of the response of the @xmath1 electrons to a generic perturbation and have shown that it has a beautiful quasilinear correlation with the scls s . however , the @xmath1 band structure is complex , with changes in width , shape and centroid position at the surfaces .",
    "we now examine the relationship between the scls s and the values of a quite different measure of the sdbs to test whether the above correlation is relevant despite the complexity of the @xmath1 band .    in earlier papers",
    "we have shown how to extract and display the individual physical effects of the presence of the surface on the electronic structure by examining the @xmath19- , symmetry- , and layer - resolved density of states ( dos ) at @xmath20 for both clean surfaces @xcite and overlayers @xcite .",
    "for the fcc(001 ) surface , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 subbands do not couple with any other low - lying bands .",
    "the bulk @xmath7 and @xmath8 contributions to the dos are accurately fitted by a simple cosine band and are thus represented by the band structure of an infinite one - dimensional chain of sites having only nearest - neighbor coupling , @xmath21 , of a non - degenerate level . for the surface layer and substrate layers underneath , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 subbands dos at @xmath20 , are accurately represented by that of a semi - infinite chain perturbed by potential shifts @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the terminal and penultimate sites .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 can be interpreted as a model of the surface shift of the diagonal matrix element of the true hamiltonian in a generalized wannier representation .",
    "we take its negative as an alternative measure of the sdbs which reflects in quantitative detail the shift in the surface @xmath1 band structure caused by the surface potential shift .",
    "the band widths @xmath24 were fixed by fitting to the bulk subbands and the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 were fixed by fitting the zeroes in the dos in the third layer .",
    "the resulting fits for the full energy and layer dependence were in general extraordinary as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the rh @xmath7 subband , for which the fitted and the calculated dos are nearly undistinguishable . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dos was fitted with @xmath22 only .",
    "the fits with two parameters are slightly better , but the @xmath22 values are robust , i.e. they change little between the one and two parameter fits .",
    "the calculated initial - state and final - state core - level shifts for the fcc(001 ) surface of the @xmath2 transition metals plotted vs. the fitted surface potential shifts , @xmath22 , for the @xmath8 , and @xmath7 subbands , are presented in figs .",
    "2a and 2b , respectively .",
    "once again we find a quasilinear correlation between the initial - state shifts and an independent measure of the sdbs s which is relatively little affected by final - state contributions to the core - level shifts , demonstrating that the correlation is indeed robust .",
    "it is very interesting that the numerical values of the scls s are not merely correlated with , but they are nearly equal to those of the potential shifts @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and particularly so for the initial - state contributions to the shifts and @xmath27 . to understand better this nearly equality",
    "we have examined the spherically symmetric part of the surface potential shift @xmath28 ,    @xmath29    together with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the radial solutions of the schrdinger equation within the corresponding atomic sphere in the bulk . to first order ,",
    "@xmath34    hold , with appropriate normalization .",
    "( 4 ) is expected to be more accurate than eq .",
    "( 5 ) since the @xmath0 core - level is much more tightly bound and the lmto - orbital by itself can not represent the full complexity of the @xmath2 band .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "4a for y , representative of the lighter @xmath2 transition metals with a positive shift , in fig .",
    "4b , for mo , representative of the mid series elements with small shifts , and in fig .",
    "4c for pd , representative of the heavier @xmath2 transition metals with a nearly filled @xmath1 band and a negative shift , we compare the computed values for the initial - state contributions to the shifts and @xmath27 with those estimated via eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in table [ tableii ] .",
    "we see that the agreement is better for the initial - state scls than for the @xmath27 s , as anticipated , but figs .",
    "4 and table [ tableii ] clearly imply that the sampling argument for explaining the correlation is correct .",
    "it could not be anticipated in advance of these plots , however , that the sampling argument must be correct , considering the complexity of the spatial dependence of @xmath28 and the fact that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 orbitals are localized in quite different regions of space .",
    "however , the spread of the @xmath2 orbitals effectively averages over the spatial fluctuations of @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noted that for radii @xmath35 larger than half the nearest neighbor separation , indicated by a vertical line in both figs .",
    "4 and 5 , the computed quantities become unreliable because of the use of the asa .",
    "the resulting uncertainties do not weaken any of the conclusions drawn above from figs . 4 and below from figs . 5",
    "figs . 1 , 2a and 2b show",
    "the well - known change of sign that was observed to occur in the middle of the @xmath36 transition series @xcite and predicted for the most close - packed surface of the observed crystal structure of the @xmath2 series @xcite .",
    "this fact has usually been qualitatively explained by using the decrease in width of the @xmath1 band at the surface compared to the bulk and assuming an approximate conservation of @xmath1 charge in each layer .",
    "thus , the self - consistent potential at the surface changes so as to mantain the @xmath1 band filling approximately constant , and consequently the surface @xmath1 band shifts relative to the bulk band .",
    "this perturbing potential acts on the core electrons as well and is repulsive for late and attractive for early transition metals .",
    "these arguments apply as well to the nominally empty or filled @xmath1 bands of sr and ag @xcite . for ag ,",
    "the @xmath37 states below and above the fermi level , @xmath38 , are hybridized with the @xmath1 states below @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath1 band narrows at the surface , as above .",
    "were the @xmath1 band center to remain unchanged , the @xmath39 hybridization of the empty states above @xmath38 would decrease , and the net @xmath1-character @xmath40 of the occupied states would increase . here",
    "@xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the density of states per atom projected on to the lmto @xmath1 basis functions , either for a bulk or a surface site .",
    "a repulsive potential shift moves the @xmath1 band center upward and conserves the @xmath1 character . for sr",
    ", the @xmath37 states are hybridized with states from the empty @xmath1 band above @xmath38 .",
    "when the empty @xmath1 band narrows , @xmath40 would decrease if the center of the @xmath1 band were to remain fixed .",
    "an attractive potential shift moves the @xmath1 band center downward and approximately conserves @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to recognize that in this argument the potential shifts are assumed to occur primarily to conserve @xmath1 character and not strictly to preserve electrical neutrality . for the heavier transition metals ,",
    "it is known @xcite that the outflow of electrons from the surface layer to the vacuum , which generates the surface dipole layer , indeed originates predominantly from states of @xmath3 and @xmath4 character . despite the qualitative consistency of the @xmath1 band - narrowing argument",
    ", we regard it as incomplete and now present a complementary but deeper analysis .",
    "the new analysis yields a considerably more detailed understanding of the surface potential shift and in the process confirms the essential features of the band - narrowing argument .",
    "the kohn - sham potential @xmath43 is conveniently decomposed into three components in our computational methods , the coulomb term @xmath44 , which is the coulomb potential within a muffin - tin sphere arising from all charge within that sphere , the madelung term @xmath45 , which is the coulomb potential arising from all charge external to that sphere and which is constant within the sphere , and the exchange - correlation term @xmath46 which is evaluated in the lda .",
    "thus , the change in the total potential is    @xmath47    where the @xmath48 indicates the difference between surface and bulk quantities .",
    "the @xmath49 are constants and are listed in table iii for y , mo and pd . the spherical averages of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are shown in the upper panel of figs .",
    "one sees inmediately that @xmath53 is of significance only in the outer region of the atomic sphere , where it is repulsive .",
    "this occurs because to lowest order the derivative    @xmath54    diverges as the density goes to zero , and the density is lowest in the outer regions of the sphere .",
    "however , comparing @xmath55 in figs . 5 with the @xmath0 and @xmath2 orbital densities in figs .",
    "4 , one sees that @xmath55 makes little contribution to the scls s and makes a comparable negative contribution to the sdbs s in all cases .",
    "@xmath56 is positive and @xmath57 is negative in all three cases .",
    "moreover , both @xmath49 and @xmath58 vary monotonically in the series y , mo , pd as illustrated by the values of @xmath59 and of @xmath60 at @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the atomic sphere radii within the asa ) listed in table iii and by the curves in figs .",
    "it is only the sum of the coulomb and madelung potential shifts which establishes the trend in the sps s , the scls s , and the sdbs s .",
    "this behavior of the potential shifts is associated with a corresponding selfconsistent behavior of the spherically averaged electron density @xmath64 .",
    "the shifts @xmath9 are plotted in the lower panels of figs . 5 for y , mo and pd , respectively , together with their decomposition , @xmath65 , into contributions from states of given angular momentun , @xmath66 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 .",
    "one sees that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions to @xmath9 are everywhere negative .",
    "table iv lists the electron number shifts    @xmath67    and the total shift per sphere    @xmath68    for the surface layer together with @xmath69 for the first vacuum layer .",
    "one sees first that the @xmath69 s are essentially equal and of the opposite sign for the vacuum and surface layers .",
    "that is , the net electron transfer occurs primarily between the surface and the vacuum , with little transfer occurring between the surface and the interior .",
    "next , one sees that for pd    @xmath70    in the surface layer .",
    "thus , for pd , @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons both flow out of the surface layer and are transferred into the surface @xmath1 bands , giving rise to the positive @xmath71 . for mo , there is less than one third as much internal transfer from @xmath3 and @xmath4 to @xmath1 , leading to a small @xmath71 .",
    "finally , for y , @xmath1 electrons flow out of the surface into the vacuum , giving rise to a negative @xmath71 .",
    "this trend in @xmath71 is precisely what is expected from the @xmath1 band - narrowing argument .",
    "because for pd the band centroid is below @xmath38 , the narrowing of the surface @xmath1 band initiates a transfer of @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons into @xmath1 electrons states at the surface which tends to increase the coulomb repulsion @xmath44 and shift the @xmath1 band centroid upward thus moderating but not eliminating the transfer . for mo , with @xmath38 near the centroid ,",
    "the effect is much smaller . for y , with the centroid above @xmath38 , the narrowing causes a decrease of the @xmath1 electrons , reducing @xmath44 and shifting the centroid downwards .",
    "one can not at this point distinguish between a transfer of @xmath1 to @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons which then flow outward and a direct outflow of @xmath1 electrons ; the effect is the same .",
    "however , the large value of @xmath72 in the outer region of the atomic sphere evident in figs .",
    "4a for y suggests at least some direct @xmath1 outflow .",
    "examination of @xmath73 in the density - shift plots in the lower panels of figs .",
    "5 reveals more interesting results .",
    "one sees clearly that both transfer from @xmath37 to @xmath1 states into the inner region of the atomic spheres and @xmath1 flow out of the outer region into the vacuum occur in all three cases . in pd transfer within",
    "the interior dominates , in mo the two effects nearly balance , and in y the outflow dominates .",
    "we have established in secs .",
    "ii and iii a robust quasilinear correlation between the surface core - level shifts and two different measures of the surface potential shift of the entire @xmath2 transition series plus sr and ag .",
    "we then demonstrated in sec .",
    "iv for the representative elements y , mo and pd that the initial - state contributions to the scls s are accurately given by the average of the sps over the @xmath0 lmto - orbital and that the sdbs is given approximately by the corresponding average over the @xmath2 orbital .",
    "the latter , being quite broad , averages over the spatial fluctuations in the sps , and so , in effect , samples a potential shift little different from that sampled by the @xmath0 orbital .",
    "this provides a detailed explanation of the correlation between the scls s and the sdbs s and does not assume an approximate spatial constancy of @xmath74 throughout the region sampled by both orbitals .",
    "finally , we show in sec . v",
    "that the sign change in the shifts across the @xmath2 series is indeed correctly given by the standard band - narrowing argument , but that the situation is considerably more complex than envisaged in the argument in its original form .",
    "in the heavier elements , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 character of the surface electron density is reduced both by flow into the vacuum and local transfer into surface @xmath1 states .",
    "that is , transfer from @xmath3 and @xmath4 states provides the increase in the @xmath1 electrons predicted by the band - narrowing argument . in the lighter elements , it is the outflow of @xmath1 electrons into the vacuum which provides the decrease in @xmath1 electrons predicted by the band - narrowing argument . in the middle of the series ,",
    "there is little net change in the number of @xmath1 electrons because the transfer from @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons into @xmath1 states at the surface is balanced by the outflow into the vacuum it is this systematic variation in the @xmath1 electron density shift and the shift in the total number of @xmath1 electrons which is responsible for the sign change in the scls s and the sdbs s through its contribution to the shift in the total hartree potential @xmath75 .    in the introduction",
    ", we pointed out that the sdbs could be regarded as a response of the @xmath1 band to a surface perturbation , @xmath76 , and as such could be used as a measure of surface chemical reactivity .",
    "however , it is a very crude measure , indicating intensity of response but giving no indication of the spatial variation or the geometry of the response .",
    "recently , some progress has been made in understanding the geometry of response as well as its intensity through the introduction of the concepts of chemical reactivity theory into the discussion of the surface chemistry of metals @xcite .",
    "the success of the present study of trends in the scls s and sdbs s suggests that studies of trends in these more sophisticated measures of chemical reactivity could be both feasible and fruitful .",

    "<S> we find that the correlation is quasilinear and robust with respect to the differencies both between initial and final - state calculations of the scls s and two distinct measures of the sdbs s . </S>",
    "<S> we show that despite the complex spatial dependence of the surface potential shift ( sps ) and the location of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 orbitals in different regions of space , the correlation exists because the sampling of the sps by the @xmath0 and @xmath2 orbitals remains similar . </S>",
    "<S> we show further that the sign change of the scls s across the transition series does indeed arise from the @xmath1 band - narrowing mechanism previously proposed . however , while in the heavier transition metals the predicted increase of @xmath1 electrons in the surface layer relative to the bulk arises primarily from transfers from @xmath3 and @xmath4 states to @xmath1 states within the surface layer , in the lighter transition metals the predicted decrease of surface @xmath1 electrons arises primarily from flow out into the vacuum .    </S>",
