    "electrical conduction in molecular junctions consisting of a single organic molecule chemically bonded to a pair of metal contacts has been studied experimentally and theoretically for more than a decade.@xcite however , direct experimental observation of the atomic scale structures of the molecule - electrode interfaces in such devices is not feasible at the present time and the determination of the nature of these interfaces continues to be an important goal in this field.@xcite the most studied single molecular junctions are those in which the molecule is terminated at its ends by thiol ( s  h ) groups and bonds to a pair of gold electrodes via the sulfur atoms.@xcite it is widely believed that when such a molecule bonds to gold electrodes , the hydrogen atoms of the thiol groups are displaced by the gold and leave the vicinity of the molecule so that the thiol groups become thiolates.@xcite however , _ ab initio _",
    "calculations@xcite have indicated that the energies of such molecular junctions with and without hydrogen atoms attached to the sulfur atoms are very similar , and that junctions with intact s ",
    "h groups might even have the lower energies@xcite , suggesting that some degree of coexistence of species with intact and dissociated s ",
    "h groups bound to gold electrodes may be possible.@xcite furthermore whether the cleavage of the s ",
    "h bond occurs on the time scales on which single - molecular junctions are formed ( and broken ) in statistical stm break junction experiments@xcite ( an experimental technique widely used today in studies of single - molecule nanoelectronics@xcite ) has still not been established .",
    "it is therefore of interest to develop a methodology that can determine unambiguously whether a thiol hydrogen atom is present in the gold - molecule - gold junction at a given time and can provide some information regarding the atomic structure of the thiol - gold region during the process by which the chemical bond between the molecule and the gold electrode forms . in this paper",
    "we explore this issue theoretically and propose inelastic tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) as an attractive candidate for such a methodology .    in single - molecule iets",
    "experiments a bias voltage is applied across a molecular junction at low temperatures and a conductance step is observed in the current - voltage characteristic of the system when the applied voltage increases beyond the threshold value for the excitation of a vibrational quantum ( commonly referred to as a  phonon \" ) in the junction .",
    "many experimental iets studies of molecular junctions have been carried out@xcite and theoretical work@xcite has accounted for various aspects of the iets data .",
    "these iets experiments together with the theoretical work demonstrated conclusively that particular molecular species are involved in electrical conduction through metal - molecule - metal junctions .",
    "it has also been shown that iets can be sensitive to the molecular conformation @xcite , the orientation of molecules relative to the electrodes@xcite and the gold - sulfur atomic bonding geometries at the molecule - metal interfaces @xcite .",
    "however , none of the above studies examined the effect that thiol hydrogen atoms , if present , might have on the inelastic tunneling spectra of molecular junctions .",
    "we do this in the present article , considering as a specific example molecular junctions with gold electrodes bridged by molecules derived from 1,3-propanedithiol ( pdt ) that retain one or both thiol hydrogen atoms .",
    "we also compare our results for these systems with our previous findings @xcite for 1,3-propanedithiolate molecules ( with no thiol hydrogen atoms ) bridging gold electrodes and with the experimental statistical stm break junction iets data of hihath _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we find iets to be able to distinguish molecules bridging gold electrodes with no hydrogen atoms bound to the sulfur atoms of the molecule from molecules with a hydrogen atom bound to one of the sulfur atoms , and from molecules with hydrogen atoms bound to both sulfur atoms .",
    "our results indicate that junctions with no hydrogen atom bound to either sulfur atom of the bridging molecule were the systems probed in most cases by the iets measurements of hihath _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we also find the data of hihath _ et al . _ to show no evidence of junctions with hydrogen atoms bound to both sulfur atoms of the bridging molecule but to be consistent with transport through molecules with a hydrogen atom bound to _ only one _ of the sulfur atoms being observed occasionally .",
    "we also find that a vibrational mode associated with the thiol hydrogen atom has a strong iets signature and that its frequency is sensitive to the distance between the thiol sulfur atom and the gold electrode to which that sulfur atom bonds .",
    "we therefore propose that by tracking the frequency of this vibrational mode in a statistical stm break junction experiment it should be possible to monitor the closing of the gap between the thiol - terminated end of the molecule and a gold electrode in real time and to detect the detachment of the thiol hydrogen atom from the molecule .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ theory ] , we outline how we calculate the relaxed molecular junction geometries , vibrational modes , low bias elastic tunneling conductances , and the conductance step heights associated with inelastic electron scattering in the molecular junctions . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results . in section [ relaxation ]",
    "we discuss the conformations of pdt molecular junctions with different numbers of sulfur atoms having attached hydrogen atoms that we obtained by density functional theory - based unconstrained relaxations of the containing one or two molecules .",
    "our calculated low bias elastic conductances of these junctions are discussed in section  [ etsresults ] . in section  [ ietsresults ] , we present the results of our calculations of the inelastic tunneling spectra of these junctions and compare them with the experimental measurements of hihath _ _ et al.__@xcite in section [ bondformation ] we present our results regarding the evolution of the inelastic tunneling spectrum of a pdt molecule one end of which is bound to a gold electrode while an intact s ",
    "h group at the other end is approached by a gold stm tip .",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss the experimental implications of our results in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the theoretical approach that we adopt here is similar to that used in refs . .",
    "in the work reported in those papers @xcite this approach was very successful in accounting for the relevant experimental iets data @xcite and identifying for the first time the experimentally realized gold - sulfur bonding geometries in gold - propanedithiolate - gold molecular junctions .",
    "an in depth discussion of the underlying theory and the relevant mathematical derivations have been presented in ref . .",
    "we therefore present only a brief summary of the theoretical approach that we use here and refer the reader to ref . for further details .    in this work we focus on inelastic tunneling processes that involve vibrational modes with large amplitudes of vibration of the hydrogen and sulfur atoms that are located at the thiol - gold interface .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to calculate accurate relaxed geometries of both the molecule and nearby atoms of the gold electrodes as well as accurate atomic displacements from equilibrium for these atoms in the vibrational modes .",
    "we do this by modeling the molecular junctions as _ extended molecules _ that consist of the molecule itself and two clusters of gold atoms representing the pair of electrodes to which the molecule binds . unlike many previous theoretical studies that calculated the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of only the molecule itself , keeping the positions of the electrode atoms frozen in the geometry of a bulk gold crystal , we calculate the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of the entire extended molecules including both the molecule and and the gold atoms .",
    "the relaxed geometries and vibrational normal modes of these extended molecules were computed using density functional theory@xcite as implemented in the gaussian  09 @xcite package with the b3pw91 density functional@xcite and the lanl2dz pseudo - potentials and basis set.@xcite our calculations were repeated for gold clusters of different sizes with up to 14 gold atoms per cluster .",
    "these gold cluster sizes were found to be sufficient to achieve convergence of our results for the vibrational mode frequencies and inelastic tunneling intensities with increasing cluster size .",
    "a physical reason for this rapid convergence with increasing cluster size is that the frequencies of the vibrational modes that we study are higher than the frequency of the highest phonon mode of bulk gold and for this reason the vibrational modes that we study have a strongly evanescent character in the gold clusters .",
    "that is , their vibrational amplitudes in the gold clusters decay very rapidly with increasing distance from the site to which the molecule bonds and are negligible on the furthest gold atoms from the molecule for the larger gold clusters that we consider . in this article",
    "we consider fully relaxed extended molecules with no geometrical constraints imposed , and also extended molecules subject to an externally imposed strain that we model by keeping the distance between two outer atoms of the gold clusters fixed during the relaxation of the extended molecule .",
    "we note that the experimental inelastic tunneling spectra of hihath _ _ et al.__@xcite were taken by sweeping the bias applied across the molecular junction while keeping the stm tip stationary relative to the substrate .",
    "our calculations of the low bias _ elastic _ conductances of the molecular junctions combine the results of the above _ ab initio _ calculations of the extended molecule geometries with landauer transport theory,@xcite green s function techniques , the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation and the semi - empirical extended hckel model with the parameters of ammeter _",
    "et al._@xcite to estimate the electronic structures for these geometries .",
    "as is discussed in detail in refs . and , this methodology involves no fitting to any experimental data relating to transport in molecular junctions .",
    "it is known to yield low bias conductances in good agreement with experiments for propanedithiolate bridging gold electrodes@xcite as well as other molecules thiol - bonded to gold electrodes @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the zero bias tunneling conductances from the landauer formula @xcite @xmath1 with the quantum unit of conductance @xmath2 , after evaluating the elastic transmission amplitudes @xmath3 from the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation . in the transmission amplitude @xmath4",

    "we calculate the iets intensities ( i.e. , the conductance step heights ) @xmath9 associated with the emission of phonons of mode @xmath10 perturbatively , in the spirit of an approach proposed by troisi _",
    "et al._@xcite who transformed the problem of calculating iets intensities into an _",

    ", we find @xmath12 at low temperatures .",
    ". [ omegaintensitya ] states that the scattering amplitude for _ inelastic _ transmission of an electron through the molecular junction is proportional to the change in the _ elastic _",
    "amplitude for transmission through the junction when its atoms are displaced from their equilibrium positions due to the excitation of vibrational mode @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 is the elastic electron transmission amplitude through the molecular junction in its equilibrium geometry from state @xmath5 with velocity @xmath8 in the electron source to state @xmath6 with velocity @xmath7 in the electron drain .",

    "we evaluate @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ omegaintensitya ] ) numerically to find the heights @xmath9  of the conductance steps that arise from inelastic tunneling processes due to emission of phonons of vibrational mode @xmath13 .",
    "the calculations are carried out at the zero bias fermi energy since the values of the bias at which the inelastic transmission occurs in the experiments of hihath _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are low .",
    "the validity of our methodology rests largely on the fact that we rely on _ ab initio _ density functional theory to calculate the frequencies and atomic displacements from equilibrium for the vibrational normal modes that give rise to the features of interest in the inelastic tunneling spectra .",
    "such calculations are accurate because in the born - oppenheimer approximation they constitute electronic _ ground state total energy",
    "_ calculations for which density functional theory is appropriate@xcite and for which the density functional model that we use@xcite has been optimized .",
    "our key predictions concern these accurately calculated frequencies ( or the associated phonon energies ) for the modes with the largest intensities in the inelastic tunneling spectra , and the dependence of these frequencies on the details of the conformation of the molecular junction .",
    "we also calculate the junction conformations using density functional theory .",
    "we rely on the extended hckel model and perturbation theory only to determine which of the vibrational modes have the largest inelastic tunneling intensities .",
    "it should also be noted that perturbative calculations of this type are appropriate provided that the transmitted electrons have energies far from any elastic resonance and if the amplitudes of the excited vibrational modes are small .",
    "these conditions are expected to be satisfied at low bias voltages and cryogenic temperatures such as those in the experiment of hihath _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also , the extended hckel model that we use has been found to yield results in reasonably good agreement with experiment for elastic@xcite and inelastic@xcite transport in a variety of molecular wires thiol - bonded to gold electrodes .",
    "we considered extended molecules where the molecule bonds via its sulfur atoms to finite clusters of gold atoms , and relaxed these entire structures using density functional theory - based calculations.@xcite we carried out the density functional geometry relaxations starting from initial trial geometries of the pdt molecule with a hydrogen atom attached to one , both or neither of the two sulfur atoms of the molecule .",
    "we were able to obtain relaxed structures in which the hydrogen atom(s ) remaining attached to one or both of the sulfur atom(s ) for bonding geometries in which the sulfur with the attached hydrogen atom bonds to one gold atom ( referred to as `` top site '' bonding geometries ) but not for geometries in which the sulfur bonds to two or three gold atoms .",
    "therefore in the remainder of this paper we will consider only top site bonded geometries ; the two other types of bonding geometries for pdt molecules with no attached thiol hydrogen atoms have been discussed in refs .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( f ) ( that has four thiol h atoms ) by 0.04ev .",
    "this suggests that a system with a dithiol molecule bridging gold electrodes may be slightly more stable energetically than that formed if the molecule dissociates into the dithiolate and a free h@xmath23 molecule .",
    "however , this ignores entropy considerations , which favor the latter system and furthermore it is not known whether the h atoms that detach from the thiol groups form h@xmath23 molecules or other , possibly more stable , moieties .",
    "it is also worth noting that the geometries of the gold clusters in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( c ) are not identical , as is also the case for fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) and ( f ) , and that conclusions drawn from the above comparisons between the energies of these structures should be approached with some caution for this reason as well .      our calculated zero bias conductance values for the molecular junctions shown in fig .",

    "however , since the calculated values differ by very modest amounts ( less than a factor of two ) , determining experimentally whether or not hydrogen atoms remain bound to the sulfur atom(s ) in experimental realizations of gold - pdt - gold molecular junctions on the basis of low bias conductance measurements alone is expected to be difficult or impossible . as shown in section [ ietsresults ] , comparing our predictions for the _ inelastic _ tunneling spectra with experiment@xcite provides strong evidence that pdt molecular junctions with no thiol hydrogen atoms predominated in the experiments of hihath _",

    "a similar ( bond length to the negative third power ) dependence of molecular vibrational frequencies on bond length was proposed empirically by philip m. morse in 1929 @xcite and later discussed by other authors @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that there are significant differences between the systems considered here and those in the early work @xcite on the dependence of vibrational frequencies and the associated force constants on bond length : the vibrational modes considered in the previous work@xcite were stretching modes , while mode iv considered here is torsional .",
    "also the bond lengths considered previously@xcite were equilibrium bond lengths that differed because the bonds were in different molecules , whereas in the present work we are considering non - equilibrium interatomic distances that differ due to differences in the geometrical constraints applied to the system .",
    "we have investigated theoretically the conformations , the elastic low bias conductances and the inelastic tunneling spectra of molecular junctions containing propanedithiol and propanedithiolate molecules bridging gold electrodes .",
    "we found that , for junctions in which the molecule bonds to a gold electrode via a sulfur atom that retains its hydrogen atom , a relaxed structure of the junction could be obtained provided that the sulfur atom bonds to a single gold atom of the electrode .",
    "this differs from propanedithiolate molecules bonding to gold via a sulfur atoms that have lost their thiol hydrogen atoms in which case relaxed geometries with a sulfur atom bonded to two or three gold atoms have also been obtained@xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that inelastic tunneling spectroscopy should be able to distinguish between junctions in which neither sulfur atom retains its thiol hydrogen atom , one of the two sulfur atoms retains its thiol hydrogen atom , or both sulfur atoms retain their thiol hydrogen atoms .",
    "comparison between our results for junctions relaxed with no geometrical constraints and the experimental inelastic tunneling data of hihath _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicates that most of their experimental measurements were carried out on junctions in which neither sulfur atom of the pdt molecule carrying the current retained its thiol hydrogen atom .",
    "we found no evidence of features in their experimental inelastic tunneling histogram@xcite that might signal conduction via a propanedithiol molecule retaining both of its thiol hydrogen atoms .",
    "however , some weak features in the experimental inelastic tunneling histogram@xcite are consistent with the possibility of a small fraction of their junctions being bridged by molecules with one sulfur atom retaining its hydrogen atom , although molecules with gauche geometries and no thiol hydrogen atoms may also be responsible for these spectral features .",
    "further experimental studies with greater sensitivity to weak features of the inelastic tunneling spectra are needed to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "we also studied the evolution of the inelastic tunneling spectrum as a gold stm tip approaches an intact s ",
    "h group at one end of a propanedithiol(ate ) molecule that is bonded to a second gold electrode via a sulfur atom that has lost its thiol hydrogen atom .",
    "we found that the frequency of a vibrational mode associated with torsional motion of the thiol hydrogen atom increases by approximately a factor of two as the stm tip approaches the molecule .",
    "since we predict this mode to have a moderately strong intensity in the inelastic tunneling spectrum this frequency shift can be used to monitor the separation between the gold stm tip and the thiol group experimentally as the tip approaches the molecule .",
    "when the thiol hydrogen atom detaches from the molecule we predict this vibrational mode to disappear from the inelastic tunneling spectrum and the energy of the strongest iets feature associated with vibrations of the sulfur to simultaneously increase by @xmath364 - 5mev while its intensity also increases .",
    "experiments observing this predicted behavior would be of interest since they would shed much needed light on how and when the thiol hydrogen atom detaches from the sulfur atom during bond formation between molecules and gold electrodes in single - molecular junctions .",
    "they may also help clarify the reasons why apparently similar experiments on gold - thiol molecular junctions often yield measured conductances differing by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
