    "the edge states shown in fig . 1 were evaluated for a hard - wall potential along the @xmath48-direction , @xmath49 .",

    "the states @xmath55 are eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( 6 ) with energy @xmath56 and complex @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 taking into account the real - space structure of the basis states ( 5 ) , the boundary condition implies that @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "solutions @xmath61 exist when @xmath62 regarding @xmath63 as a function of @xmath64 , the equation @xmath65 provides the implicit dispersion relation of the one - dimensional edge states .",
    "there are two solutions for @xmath66 which close the gap and propagate to the left , @xmath67 , in addition to a pair of solutions for @xmath68 corresponding to counter - propagating modes which disappear when the energy becomes sufficiently close to the lower ( @xmath69 ) band .",
    "the energy can be chosen to intersect only the co - propagating modes .",
    "the edge states in fig . 1 correspond to modes which propagate along the bottom edge of the sample .",
