    "the higgs boson @xcite plays an important role in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite because it is responsible for generating the masses of all the elementary particles ( leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons ) .",
    "however , the higgs - boson sector is the least tested in the sm , in particular the higgs boson self - interaction .",
    "the search for higgs bosons is one of the principal missions of present and future high - energy colliders .",
    "the observation of this particle is of major importance for the present understanding of fundamental interactions . indeed , in order to accommodate the well established electromagnetic and weak interaction phenomena , the existence of at least one isodoblete scalar field to generate fermion and weak gauge bosons masses is required . despite repeated success in explaining the present data , the sm can not be completely tested before this particle has been experimentally observed and its fundamental properties studied .",
    "the triple and quartic higgs boson couplings @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined through the potential    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the physical higgs field . in the sm",
    ", we obtain @xmath17 as the simple relationship between the higgs boson mass @xmath18 and the self - coupling @xmath13 where @xmath19 @xmath8 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson .",
    "the triple vertex of the higgs field @xmath12 is given by the coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "an accurate test of this relationship may reveal the extended nature of the higgs sector .",
    "the measurement of the triple higgs boson coupling is one of the most important goals of higgs physics in a future @xmath21 linear collider experiment .",
    "this would provide the first direct information on the higgs potential that is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the future @xmath21 linear collider can not only be designed to operate in @xmath21 collision mode , but can also be operated as a @xmath6 collider .",
    "this is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial @xmath21 beams .",
    "the design of the photon linear collider and physics opportunities are described in references @xcite and the possibility of measuring the @xmath22 coupling is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the triple higgs boson self - coupling can be measured directly in pair - production of higgs particles at hadron and high - energy @xmath21 linear colliders .",
    "several mechanisms that are sensitive to @xmath23 can be exploited for this task .",
    "higgs pairs can be produced through double higgs - strahlung of @xmath24 or @xmath25 bosons @xcite , @xmath26 or @xmath27 fusion @xcite as well as through gluon - gluon fusion in @xmath28 collisions @xcite and high - energy @xmath6 fusion @xcite at photon colliders . in @xmath6 collisions ,",
    "double higgs production is possible in several reactions at the tree level , and one process , @xmath29 , at the one - loop level :    @xmath30    as was studied in @xcite the reaction @xmath31 is free from any background except incorrect combinatorial of jets ; for @xmath32 @xmath8 , the main branching is four @xmath33-jets ( with an invariant mass peak at @xmath34 ) plus jets from two additional @xmath24 bosons , up to four , and/or a large missing energy .",
    "8-jet events can be detected in total : for @xmath35 @xmath8 , the signature includes up to twelve quark jets with the invariant mass peaking at @xmath36 and @xmath34 .    in the case of the process @xmath37",
    ", the important contribution happens when the considered fermion is a quark - top since the higgs - fermion coupling is proportional to the fermion mass . for completeness",
    ", we have also calculated the contribution when the fermion is a @xmath33-quark .",
    "we have found that this last contribution is negligible @xmath38 @xmath39 for @xmath40 @xmath8 and @xmath41 ) .    the study of the four - body processes with quark top @xmath11 , @xmath42 , in which the sm higgs boson is radiated by a @xmath43 quark at future @xmath6 colliders @xcite with a c.m .",
    "energy in the range of 500 to 3000 @xmath8 , as in the case of the desy tev energy superconducting linear accelerator ( tesla ) machine @xcite , is necessary in order to know its impact on other processes and also to search for new relations that could have a clear signature of the higgs boson production .",
    "another process with double higgs production in @xmath6 collisions is @xmath29 .",
    "this reaction proceeds at the one - loop level .",
    "analytical results for the amplitude and a detailed numerical analysis were carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the higgs coupling with top quarks , the largest coupling in the sm , is directly accessible in the process where the higgs boson is radiated off top quarks @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , this process can be used to probe the @xmath44 yukawa coupling directly .",
    "this process also depends on the higgs boson triple self - coupling , which could lead us to obtain the first non - trivial information on the higgs potential .",
    "we are interested in finding regions that could allow the observation of the @xmath45 processes at the next generation of high energy @xmath6 linear colliders .",
    "we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level ( fig .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we study the triple higgs boson self - coupling through the processes @xmath46 at next generation linear @xmath6 colliders . in sec .",
    "iii , we have considered the background for the process @xmath47 and we have studied their sensitivity to different values of the triple vertex . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for @xmath48 @xmath2 with double higgs boson production .",
    "since the higgs - fermion coupling is proportional to the fermion mass , we analyzed the @xmath11-quark case in more detail .",
    "we carried out the calculations using the framework of the standard model at next generation linear @xmath6 colliders .",
    "for the initial photon we use the spectrum of backscattered photons for unpolarized beams as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the calchep @xcite packages to check the different parts of the calculations of the matrix elements and cross - sections .",
    "these packages provide automatic computation of the cross - sections and distributions in the sm as well as their extensions at tree - level .",
    "we consider the high energy stage of a possible next linear @xmath6 collider with @xmath49 @xmath8 and design luminosity 1 and @xmath50 .",
    "to illustrate our results of the sensitivity to the @xmath22 triple higgs boson self - coupling , we show the dependence of the cross - section on the center - of - mass energy of @xmath49 @xmath8 for @xmath47 in fig . 2 for several values of the higgs boson mass @xmath51 @xmath8 . the variation of the cross - section for the modified triple couplings @xmath4 is evaluated for some values of @xmath52 in the range ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the cross - section is sensitive to the value of the triple couplings as well as to the higgs boson mass .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath23 increases with the collider energy , reaching a maximum at the end of the range considered : @xmath54 @xmath8 . as an indicator of the order of magnitude we present the higgs boson number of events in table 1 ( of course we have to multiplicate for the corresponding branching ratios to obtain the observable number of events ) for several higgs boson masses , center - of - mass energy and @xmath52 values and for a luminosity of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we also include a contours plot for the number of events of the studied processes in the @xmath57 plane with @xmath58 @xmath8 and @xmath9 in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "these contours are obtained from table 1 .    finally , for the @xmath59 process , the cross - section as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath60 for @xmath40 @xmath8 and @xmath41 is negligible ( @xmath61 ) . in these conditions",

    "total production of higgs boson pairs in the sm for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for the process that we are studying , @xmath64 , we have considered the following background : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . if we consider a center - of - mass energy of @xmath67 @xmath8 of the parent @xmath21 and a higgs boson mass of @xmath40 @xmath8 these process have total cross section of 0.006 @xmath39 and 0.004 @xmath39 respectively , while the signal process has 0.006 @xmath39 .",
    "considering that @xmath68 and @xmath69 and after @xmath33-tagging one can expect the ratio to be @xmath70 . in fig . 5 ( a ) we show the ratio    @xmath71    as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath60 and different values of the higgs boson mass .",
    "we also consider the separate contributions of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 backgrounds in fig . 5 ( b ) .",
    "we should note that the @xmath33-tagging would remove the possible background from @xmath24 bosons due to a small branching ratio of @xmath74 and then we neglect the background from @xmath24 bosons that come from the @xmath75 process .    in order to quantify the sensitivity of the considered reaction to different values of @xmath52 we use the statistical sensitivity , @xmath76 , which is defined as @xcite :    @xmath77}},\\ ] ]    where , @xmath78 is the expected number of events as a function of @xmath52 , @xmath79 is the number of events expected from the standard model and @xmath80 is the number of observed events . while , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the total integrated luminosity , the cross section as a function of @xmath52 , the standard model cross section ( @xmath83 ) , the intensity level for background events and the cross section for the background process , respectively .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the statistical analysis when the experiment does not show any deviation from the sm at 95% c.l . for the @xmath23 coupling .",
    "these regions correspond to @xmath84 ( 95% c.l .",
    "correspond to @xmath85 ) for differents values of the center - of - mass energy , the @xmath21 luminosity and the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 measure the background importance .",
    "as the masses we are considering for the higgs are different of the z boson mass then it could be possible separate the higgs signal from the z background by reconstructing the jet - jet mass . in this conditions",
    "we also take into account the possibility of a small background . in fig .",
    "6 we show the case with very small background ( @xmath87 ) and full background ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "as a possible option of the international linear collider ( ilc ) , the feasibility of physics opportunities of high energy physics photon - photon interaction has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the high energy photon linear collider ,",
    "high energy photon beams are generated by inverse compton scattering between the electron and the laser beams .",
    "the @xmath6 collider represents a possible opportunity for the triple higgs boson self - coupling analysis .",
    "we have analyzed the triple higgs boson self - coupling at future @xmath6 collider energies with the reactions @xmath46 where @xmath89 and considering the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level and in the frame work of the standard model .",
    "we found that for the process @xmath90 , the complete calculation at tree level gives a production cross - section of the order of a fraction of a femtobarn , i.e. , @xmath91 @xmath39 and @xmath92 @xmath39 for @xmath93 @xmath8 , respectively , and at the end of the examined energy range .",
    "these values are , however , larger than the production cross - section for @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the number of events obtained considering the decay products of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 is enough to obtain relevant information about the triple higgs self - coupling .",
    "moreover , this process can be used to probe the @xmath44 yukawa coupling .",
    "we have also done a background analysis concluding that the background intensity is below the signal level .",
    "the ratio @xmath96 is show in fig .",
    "on the other hand we have also studied the sensitivity to the values of the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "we show the results as 95% c.l .",
    "regions in the @xmath5 plane for different values of the center - of - mass energy @xmath60 , the luminosity @xmath97 and the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "the limits for @xmath52 are @xmath34 dependent and we can see that the most stringent limit are possible for positive values of @xmath52 . finally , the study of this process is important and could be useful to probe the triple higgs boson self - couplings @xmath23 using a @xmath0 collider with very high luminosity and high center - of - mass energy .",
    "in addition , to our knowledge , these results have never been reported in the literature before and could be of relevance for the scientific community since the studied process is complementary of other studied in the literature .",
