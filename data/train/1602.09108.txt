    "infectious diseases in livestock can spread via various paths .",
    "one of the main transmission routes is livestock trade @xcite .",
    "other transmission routes include direct contact , aerial transmission ( e.g. geographical closeness to an index premise ) @xcite and vectors ( insect , human , appliances ) @xcite .",
    "livestock trade is of particular importance , since infectious animals can transmit a disease over long distances between premises .",
    "therefore , massive trade restrictions are implemented in case of an outbreak of a highly contagious disease such as classical swine fever @xcite . however , before the first disease case is detected , the disease can spread unrestrictedly via trade .",
    "the timespan of this unrestricted trade is called high risk period and can take weeks to months @xcite .",
    "in addition , trade restrictions are normally not implemented for some endemic diseases such as salmonellosis .",
    "hence , these diseases might freely spread via trade .",
    "the spreading of an infectious disease by trade involves a number of different actors ( e.g. farms , slaughterhouses or traders ) . as these actors form a complex trade system , it is crucial to have an understanding of this trade system .",
    "such systems can be modeled as complex networks .",
    "this analysis focusses on the german pig trade network as a substrate for spreading of infections in pigs .",
    "the german pork industry is one of the largest in the world . in the years 20112013 , germany was the third largest pork producer after the china and the usa @xcite .",
    "about 4.5 million tons of pork meat are produced in germany every year .",
    "the gain in production value is about 7 billion euros per year @xcite . for the classical swine fever outbreaks in germany in the 1990s",
    ", it has been shown that the most frequent source of infection in secondary outbreaks was the trade with infected pigs @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this work to clarify how a disease principally can spread along the german pig trade network .",
    "this means estimating the potential transmission ways of a disease between premises connected by direct or indirect trade contacts . in other words , the considered network forms the basis ( i.e. the substrate ) for disease spread via pig trade in germany . in reality",
    "the spread of infectious disease via trade depends on additional parameters .",
    "these parameters can be disease specific ( e.g. virulence ) , farm specific ( e.g. biosecurity level ) or behavioral . since these specific parameters would bias the principal spreading pathways via trade , we exclude them from our analysis . hereby , the considered spreading mechanism mimics theoretically possible spreading paths  even if the true transmission probability might be lower for instance due to biosecurity measures .    in order to achieve the aim of revealing potential infection paths in the german pig trade network , the contact patterns between the actors of the system have to be analyzed .",
    "in general , contact patterns among hosts forming a contact network are considered as one of the most critical factors contributing to inhomogeneous pathogen transmission , where the assumption of a mass - action process does not hold . during the last decades ,",
    "veterinary epidemiologists have been focusing on the disease transmission between livestock farms .",
    "premises and animal movements between premises can be translated into nodes and edges of a contact network , respectively .",
    "techniques adopted from social network analysis ( sna ) have been intensively applied by veterinary epidemiologists in order to get a better understanding of the spatio - temporal livestock disease dynamics @xcite and to identify network actors that are central to the spread of infectious diseases @xcite .    in order to understand the dynamics of disease spread in complex networks",
    ", it is essential to analyze their large scale structure .",
    "this is necessary to estimate the size and the incidence rate of a disease outbreak . with this information",
    "the consequences of the introduction of a contagious disease can be estimated and control measures can be planned .",
    "if nodes and edges differ from one another with respect to their centrality , i.e. to their potential to spread disease , this variability can be used to rank the nodes and edges .",
    "such a ranking allows veterinary authorities to select nodes and edges for the implementation of targeted surveillance and control measures following a central things first rule @xcite .",
    "node rankings can be refined using meta information in form of edge weights .",
    "in addition , using the temporal resolution of trade data provides a much more realistic picture of possible outbreak dynamics .    concerning the german pig trade system as a complex network",
    ", there is no systematic characterization of this system in the literature so far .",
    "remarkable exceptions are @xcite , where a subset of the whole network was analyzed including different production types and @xcite , where the german pig trade network was analyzed using a data - driven approach . in this work",
    "we characterize the static and temporal network of pig trade in germany as a substrate for spreading processes for the first time .",
    "this article is an attempt to provide a comprehensive picture and characterization of the german pig trade network . in order to give a transparent picture of the network ,",
    "we hereby avoid the usage of external parameters whenever possible .",
    "therefore , neither explicit disease specific parameters nor specific intervention measures such as trade restrictions are considered .",
    "in addition , the analysis provided here can be regarded as a general framework to investigate livestock trade networks .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : first , we briefly describe the data under consideration . in section",
    "_ static network analysis _ we analyze the pig trade data as a static network , where we characterize the network from a large scale perspective and discuss different strategies for targeted vaccination . section _",
    "weighted network analysis _ gives a brief overview of the impact of trade volume on the static network results .",
    "we consider the temporal resolution of the network data set in sections _ network as time series _ and _ temporal network analysis_. the network is considered as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots in section _ network as time series_. finally , we take into account causality for network traversal in section _ temporal network analysis_.      in this article we analyze an extract of the hi - tier database @xcite .",
    "the database comprises livestock movements of pigs in germany since 2006 .",
    "the extract under consideration represents the trade between premises of the pork production chain in germany in the period between 2011 - 01 - 01 and 2014 - 12 - 31 .",
    "considered data are owner , prepossessor , trade date and trade volume . thereof",
    "a network is generated where trading premises are _ nodes _ that are connected by directed _ edges _ ( trade links ) .",
    "in addition , trade volume can be included as further information giving a weight to each edge of the network .",
    "the system consists of elementary pork production chains .",
    "[ fig : pork_prod_chain ] depicts a schematic illustration of the underlying farming system of the network .",
    "the figure shows only the production chain of piglet production , raising , fattening and slaughter .",
    "traders and breeding are not shown .",
    "the resulting network is analyzed in different representations :    1 .   _",
    "static network_.[en : uno ] direction of trade is taken into account .",
    "trade connections are aggregated over time , i.e. the network is static .",
    "a trade link is drawn if there is at least one trade action over the observation period .",
    "in addition , we analyze the impact of trade volume .",
    "network as time series_. [ en : dos ] the system is considered as a time series of directed network snapshots at different time steps .",
    "edge weights are considered to some extent .",
    "temporal network_. [ en : tres ] the system is considered as a time series of directed network snapshots at different time steps .",
    "in addition , causality is fully considered for network traversal via edge sequences .    in each case",
    "the network comprises of 97,980 nodes . the static representation ( [ en : uno ] . )",
    "consists of 315,333 edges . for the temporal cases ( [ en : dos ] . ) and ( [ en : tres ] . )",
    "the data set contains 6,359,697 trade transactions ( edges ) .",
    "the observation period is @xmath0 , i.e. 1.5 million edges per year .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze the trade data as a static network . a static network or _ graph _ @xmath1 consists of a set of nodes @xmath2 and a set of edges @xmath3 , where every edge connects a pair of nodes . in the considered network",
    ", edges have a direction given by trade .",
    "mathematically , a network can be represented as an adjacency matrix @xmath4 with elements @xmath5 if there is an edge from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 , and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "the total number of neighbors ( trade partners ) of a node ( premise ) is called its _ degree _ or _",

    "we will see that the directed nature of trade plays a major role here .    in principle ,",
    "the outbreak size of any epidemic on a network is limited by the component structure of the network as a worst case scenario .",
    "a _ component _ is a subset of nodes @xmath9 for which a path exists between any pair of nodes in @xmath10 .",
    "a _ path _ @xmath11 between two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 is an indirect connection between them via arbitrarily many edges without traversing a node twice . note that for directed networks , @xmath11 does not necessarily imply @xmath12 .",
    "in general there may exist a large number of paths between two nodes . in this article , by path we always mean the _ shortest path _ , i.e. the @xmath11 with the smallest number of traversed edges .",
    "the average shortest path length in the considered network is 5.5 , i.e. on average it takes 5.5 steps to go from a randomly chosen node to another randomly chosen node .",
    "the maximum shortest path length is called _ diameter _ and its value is 18 for the considered network ( see table  [ tab : properties ] ) .    neglecting the directionality of edges ,",
    "the network exhibits a giant component , which in directed network is commonly called giant weakly connected component ( gwcc ) . for the considered network ,",
    "it comprises almost all nodes ( see table [ tab : properties ] ) .",
    "this means that virtually all nodes of the network are at least touched by trade connections .",
    "we find that 99 % of all nodes are connected through trade contacts .",
    "nodes not belonging to the gwcc form other components which are only very small islands in the network .",

    "we now focus on the microscopic structure of the weighted network .",
    "edge weights can be used in order to compute node centrality more accurately .",
    "the weighted degree distribution shows a similar shape as for the unweighted case .",
    "figure [ fig : edge_weight_cdf ] shows the edge weight distribution of the network .",
    "weight is measured in terms of total number of traded animals during the observation period .",
    "the edge weight plays a significant role for the computation of shortest paths as it is implicitly contained in most centrality measures .",
    "if for instance 1000 animals have been traded from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 and 10 animals have been traded between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath13 , the weight of the edge @xmath14 is significantly higher and this edge would probably be traversed in a shortest path .",
    "we compute the centrality measures as in the main text for the weighted network .",
    "figure [ fig : weighted_attack ] shows the impact of node removal based on weighted centrality measures .",
    "the results show qualitatively the same behavior as for the unweighted case .",
    "overall we obtain a similar picture as for the unweighted case : nodes of large degree ( i.e. sum of trade volume to neighbors ) or betweenness perform well for targeted intervention measures .",
    "it is remarkable however that the degree shows a good performance , when only relatively few nodes are removed .",
    "closeness performs significantly worse than in the unweighted case .",
    "we conclude that :    1 .",
    "any centrality based intervention performs significantly better than random intervention !",
    "2 .   removal of high weight nodes is efficient for removal of up to 100 nodes .",
    "3 .   removal of high betweenness nodes is efficient for removal of more than 100 nodes .",
    "4 .   the average edge weight corresponds to a very high infection probability per edge .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    finally , we estimate how edge weights can be mapped onto infection probabilities .",
    "every transport of one or more infectious animals is equally infectious .",
    "first , we compute the probability that _ exactly _ one animal is infectious @xmath15 for a transport going from premise @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath16 animals are transported .",
    "this probability is given by a binomial distribution @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the probability that an animal is infected in the source node  @xmath6 .",
    "this probability is given by the prevalence in node  @xmath6 .",
    "second , we compute the probability that _ at least _ one animal is infectious @xmath19 for a transport going from premise @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the probability is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) of @xmath22 .",
    "the in - farm prevalence for diseases relevant here ( classical swine fever , aujeszky s disease , foot and mouth disease ) is typically 30 - 50  % at the time of detection @xcite .    for the data",
    "set considered here we observe an average edge weight of @xmath23 for every trade transaction ( considering the aggregated edge weight would give @xmath24 ) . assuming that the prevalence in the source premise is 30  % as explained above , i.e. @xmath25 , it follows that the probability that an average trade link is infective is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the complementary cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution .",
    "this means that the expected infection probability per trade transaction is almost 1 .",
    "consequently , the probability of infection if significantly smaller than 1 only for low volume trade transactions .",
    "figure [ fig : node_activity ] shows the fraction of active nodes over time for two aggregation windows . for the @xmath28 aggregation window , the annual loss is approximately 2,800 nodes .",
    "in the tracing procedure mentioned in the main text a pathogen is assumed to only take one step at each snapshot . there might be necessity for some pathogens that multiple steps are allowed in every snapshot . in the context of contact tracing",
    ", we refer to this circumstance as _ prudent _ contact tracing .",
    "this corresponds to the situation that a pathogen goes from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 and then from node @xmath7 to node @xmath13 and so forth at the same day . in order to take this into account",
    ", we add allow for arbitrary long paths in each snapshot @xcite .",
    "given a temporal network as a sequence of adjacency matrices @xmath29 , we define the long path corrected network as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the diameter of the aggregated network .",
    "the measured value for the diameter is @xmath32 ( see main text ) .",
    "thus , we allow for a maximum of 18 steps in each snapshot .",
    "this value can be revised downwards depending on assumptions about the disease under consideration or data quality . given the path corrected network ,",
    "prudent contact tracing can be done using the method as described in the main text , but with the temporal network as defined in .",
    "considering the large scale picture of the network , the long path correction does not make a significant difference .",
