    "the other scheme is the m@xmath0-magnetometer .",
    "it directly measures the larmor frequency on the optical signal , which is commonly introduced by a 90@xmath3-configuration , comprising a pump and a probe beam .",
    "many derived schemes are established in research , often focusing on special frequency ranges , such as serf ( spin exchange relaxation free ) magnetometry  @xcite or the implementation of differential measurement schemes , such as the use of balanced detection , which suppresses the common mode laser noise .    in this paper",

    "the design criteria for the setup was having an easy implementable design of a rubidium magnetometer with a reproducible sensitivity .",
    "one of the advantages of the m@xmath0 design is the possibility to allow the detection completely based on alternating currents ( ac ) .",
    "this suppresses a number of unwanted noise effects , such as laser power fluctuations , and other sources of @xmath7 , and @xmath8-noise .",
    "the common way of implementing an m@xmath0-magnetometer is a configuration with a pump and a probe beam .",
    "another simplified way is to combine both beams and apply the reference b@xmath5-field in an angle of 45@xmath3  with respect to a single laser beam .    the optical setup of our m@xmath0-magnetometer is shown in fig .",

    "since the high frequency noise levels ( noise@xmath69 ) are significantly smaller than the low frequency noise levels ( noise@xmath65 ) , we have estimated two signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "for the snr@xmath65 we chose the noise@xmath65 in immediate proximity to the signal - peak by averaging the noise floor between the signal - peak and the 50  hz side - peak of the power line from 4960 to 4995  hz , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig09 ] .",
    "this noise level consist of low - frequency components caused by magnetic field fluctuations around the signal - peak .",
    "for snr@xmath69 the noise noise@xmath69 is used , corresponding to the average noise level between 41 and 44  khz .",
    "the full sensitivity of the magnetometer is a combination of the experimental values derived above .",
    "it is calculated as    @xmath70    with the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath61 .    with the aforementioned described measurements ,",

    "a second sensitivity @xmath74 is determined referring to the snr@xmath65 .",
    "for this sensitivity , our optimum @xmath74 of 1.5  pt/@xmath1 was found at an incoming laser power of 0.05  mw , resulting in an snr@xmath65 of 12800 and a width @xmath52 of 88  hz .",
    "these values are derived from the optimization process which is described in the following .",
    "as described above , the sensitivity is determined by an interplay between the magnetic resonance hwhm and the snr .",
    "the best magnetometer sensitivity is obtained at the smallest ratio between them .",
    "a variety of effects influence these parameters .",
    "examples are the number of polarized ( pumped ) atoms , the coherence of the larmor precession between the single atoms , the influence of the rf b@xmath18 field , magnetic field - inhomogeneities , noise etc .. all these ( internal ) influences are summarized in the linewidth and the signal - to - noise ratio . in the following , we present an optimization routine to achieve the highest sensitivity of the magnetometer configuration . although there are more parameters which in principle can be taken into account ( beam - diameter , density of the vapor ) .",
    "a change of the most evident parameters is presented .",
    "the best sensitivity dependent on the power of the rf b@xmath18 field , and the incoming laser power is determined below .",
    "the linewidth @xmath75 of the phase signal @xmath16 , which has been introduced above , is immune to rf b@xmath18 power broadening for a wide range .",

    "the maxima are located at laser powers of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , as indicated by the gray dashed lines . ]",
    "the both measurement sequences over the laser power of the @xmath75 ( fig .",

    "the obtained curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] exhibit minima for the best sensitivity .",
    "it should be mentioned that in case of a sufficient time capacity , a more accurate optimization can be performed by a two - dimensional - series approach with the b@xmath18-amplitude , and the laser power .     determined by eqn .",

    "in conclusion , we have presented and characterized a compact and simple m@xmath0-magnetometer based on atomic rubidium .",
    "a focus was given to a special cell design , which features an anti - relaxation coating , and neon buffer gas . in terms of magnetometer sensitivity , the cells fail to perform at the level compared to when they were first produced one year ago .",
    "additionally , they are 10 - 100  @xmath89 less sensitive to comparable cell describes in literature  @xcite . on the other hand , typically cell designs are larger and do not incooperate any collision enhancing glass features , such as the appendix , which can host a solid state sample .    the magnetometer s sensitivity is determined to be 0.6  pt/@xmath1 .",
    "this is based on an independent estimation of the larmor spin precession linewidth and the achievable signal - to - noise ratio in our experimental configuration .",
    "since the snr was determined in a free - running magnetometer configuration , we believe that it will be possible to suppress the low - frequency noise components even more .",
    "the magnetometer s performance is characterized in slow b@xmath17-scans and in 1  sec time - series recordings . with regard to the experimental equipment",
    "the photo - diode configuration for the measurement is not ideal , and we experienced different noise levels for different amplification ratios .",
    "a photo - diode design based on a sensitive transimpedance amplifier ( dlpca-200 , femto gmbh ) will be implemented in the future .",
    "another important improvement is the in - house design of a low - noise current source , which targets the 10@xmath90 relative accuracy regime with a maximum range of a few ma . for the compensation of field gradients",
    ", we will divide the coil pairs into independent coils , which are then independently driven by current drivers .",
    "the magnetometer is prepared to be combined with solid state spin samples . a small appendix ( @xmath30 2  mm , 10  mm depth ) with sub - mm thick walls can host another experiment . at present , we have prepared an optically shielded , fiber - coupled nitrogen - vacancy ensemble with a microwave loop antenna , which can be inserted into the appendix .",
    "earlier designs featuring a hole through the entire glass cell , were not pursued further , but may eventually allow for the application with liquid samples  @xcite . for these combination experiments , the implementation of a light - driven larmor precession ( bell - bloom type  @xcite ) will allow for exciting the atomic spin ensemble completely independent of the solid - state sample .",
