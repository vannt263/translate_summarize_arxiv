    "after the conjecture by bohigas , gianonni and schmit in 1984 @xcite , that chaotic systems are well described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , research started to demonstrate this connection on dynamical grounds by means of semiclassical methods based on analyzing energy averaged products of expressions similar to the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite for the density of states , that are asymptotically exact in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "for open systems we are particularly interested in the scattering matrix @xmath1 , which is an @xmath2 matrix if the scattering leads carry @xmath3 states or channels in total .",
    "its elements can , like the gutzwiller trace formula , be expressed @xcite in terms of sums over the classical trajectories containing the stability factors of the orbits @xmath4 and rapidly oscillating phases depending on the classical actions @xmath5 of the considered trajectories @xmath6 divided by @xmath7 @xmath8 with @xmath9 with the mean level spacing of the quantum system @xmath10 . here the sum is over the scattering trajectories that connect the two channels @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for systems with two ( or more )",
    "leads the scattering matrix breaks up into reflecting and transmitting subblocks , so we might restrict our attention to trajectories starting and ending in certain leads .    in the context of spectral statistics ,",
    "i.e.  for the two point correlation function of the density of states containing a double sum over periodic orbits , this dynamical understanding of the conjecture @xcite was - as for other quantities - achieved in several steps . starting with the pairing of identical ( or time reversed orbits in the presence of time reversal symmetry )",
    "the so called diagonal contribution was evaluated in ref .   using a sum rule from ref .  .",
    "nondiagonal contributions consisting of pairs of long orbits differing essentially only in the place where one of the orbits possesses a self crossing and the other avoids this crossing were analyzed in ref .  .",
    "this was extended @xcite and formalized for orbits differing at several places , so called encounters .    in the context of transport ,",
    "i.e.  for example for the two - point correlator of scattering matrix elements , which if restricted to the transmission subblocks is via the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite proportional to the conductance , the diagonal contribution was calculated in ref .  .",
    "an orbit pair differing only in one crossing was analyzed in ref .",
    "and this was again extended to orbits differing at several places@xcite .",
    "these results and those for closed systems agreed with results from rmt , but besides this dynamical understanding of the rmt results , these semiclassical calculations proved very successful in determining the effect of a finite ehrenfest time @xmath13 on transport quantities , starting with the pioneering work of ref .  .",
    "the ehrenfest time @xcite separates times when the time evolution of a particle follows essentially the classical dynamics from times when it is dominated by wave interference .",
    "its value is obtained as the time when two points inside a wave packet initially of quantum size @xmath14 with the fermi momentum @xmath15 evolve to points with a distance @xmath16 of the linear system size .",
    "we thus get due to the exponential separation of neighboring trajectories in the chaotic case @xmath17 with the lyapunov exponent @xmath18 .",
    "before these semiclassical calculations of the ehrenfest - time dependence , there already existed theories to describe the effect of a finite ehrenfest time on the correlators of scattering matrix elements : aleiner and larkin obtained @xcite for the correlator of two transmission matrices , i.e.  the conductance , an exponential suppression with increasing ehrenfest time in agreement with semiclassics .",
    "this work was however unsatisfactory in one main aspect : a small amount of impurity scattering was introduced by hand to imitate the effects of diffraction in a ballistic system .    another phenomenological theory to describe",
    "the effect of a finite ehrenfest time is effective rmt @xcite .",
    "it splits the phase space and thereby also the underlying scattering matrix of the considered system into a classical and a quantum part , where the first one is determined by all trajectories shorter than @xmath13 and the second one by all trajectories longer than @xmath13 , as well as introducing an artificial phase dependent on the ehrenfest time .",
    "the predictions of this theory are only partially correct : weak localization is predicted to be independent of the ehrenfest time , while the previously mentioned theories and also numerical simulations @xcite predict it to decay with the ehrenfest time .",
    "in contrast to the quantum correction of weak localization , effective rmt gave good predictions for effects at leading order in @xmath3 such as shot noise @xcite or the gap in the density of states of a chaotic andreev billiard @xcite .",
    "staying only at the leading order in inverse channel number we will consider the correlation function of @xmath19 scattering matrices at alternating energies defined as @xmath20^n   , \\ ] ] where for simplicity the energy @xmath21 is measured with respect to the ( fermi ) energy @xmath22 and in units of the so called thouless energy @xmath23 with the dwell time @xmath24 measuring the typical time a particle stays inside the system .",
    "the latter is related to the heisenberg time @xmath25 via the relation @xmath26 .",
    "the ehrenfest - time dependence is incorporated in @xmath27 .",
    "the explicit form is @xmath28 with the rmt ( i.e.  @xmath29 ) part of this correlation function denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the term in ( [ eq5 ] ) derives from effective rmt @xcite .",
    "although this theory describes certain phenomena quite well , e.g.  the dependence of the andreev gap on the ehrenfest time @xcite , a dynamical justification of this result is still lacking . so far ref . calculated @xmath31 for @xmath32 while refs",
    ".   showed the separation into two terms in ( [ eq4 ] ) to be a consequence of the preservation under time evolution of a phase - space volume of the system .",
    "moreover they also calculated the explicit form we give in ( [ eq6 ] ) for the second term and that the first term in ( [ eq5 ] ) is proportional to the factor @xmath33 .",
    "because of ( [ eq1 ] ) the correlation function can be written semiclassically in terms of @xmath19 scattering trajectories connecting channels along a closed cycle like in fig .",
    "this leads to trajectory sets with encounters as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , c which can then be moved into the leads to create the remaining diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . including the correct prefactors and the energy dependence ,",
    "the correlation function becomes semiclassically @xmath34 @xmath35 are the times trajectories @xmath6 spend inside the system , and we identify the channels @xmath36 .",
    "note that ( [ eq6a ] ) and this identification imply that the trajectories and their partners ( traversed in reversed direction ) considered in @xmath31 form a closed cycle .    ]    in this paper we want to show how ( [ eq4],[eq5],[eq6 ] ) can be obtained using the trajectory based methods developed in refs .  .",
    "in sec.[part1 ] we consider the first term in ( [ eq4 ] ) : we show that the prefactor @xmath30 of the exponential is indeed given by the rmt expression obtained in ref .   and that this is multiplied by the exponential given in ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the underlying diagrams considered here are the same as the ones occurring also in the semiclassical calculation of the rmt contribution . in sec .",
    "[ part2 ] we consider the second term in ( [ eq4 ] ) and show how this contribution arises from trajectories that are always correlated .",
    "furthermore we show in sec .  [ mixing ] that there exist no mixed terms between the first and the second term in ( [ eq4 ] ) , that could result - expressed in terms of the considered diagrams - from correlations between trajectories always correlated with each other on the one side and trajectories only correlated with each other during encounters on the other side .",
    "the main idea in this section is to split our diagrams in a different way compared to the semiclassical analysis without ehrenfest time ( referred to as the rmt - treatment ) and the analysis of the ehrenfest - time dependence of the cases @xmath32 in ref .  : in the semiclassical calculation one considers an arbitrary number of orbits encountering each other .",
    "it turns out in the rmt - treatment to be sufficient to consider only encounters where all orbits are linearizable up to the _ same _ point , see for example fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . when taking into account the ehrenfest - time dependence this is no longer sufficient as was first shown in ref .",
    "; see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for an example of an additional diagram analyzed in this case .",
    "the main complication arising in ref .",
    "is then to treat these encounters . to simplify the calculation we imagine",
    "these encounters being built up out of several encounters , each of which consist of two encounter stretches .",
    "we have distinguished these 2-encounters by different boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in this way",
    "it is much easier to consider encounter diagrams of arbitrary complexity with finite ehrenfest time , which did not appear in the formalism used in ref .  .",
    "the encounter stretches are marked by a box ( shown red ) . ]",
    "we first illustrate our procedure by considering three correlated orbits with two 2-encounters as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and show how the result given in ref .   can be obtained in this case and then we treat the general case of @xmath37 orbits with @xmath38 independent or overlapping 2-encounters .      in the treatment of the rmt - type contribution ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "we first consider the case in which all the encounters occur inside the system .",
    "for @xmath39 we have the two semiclassical diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , c which include a trajectory set ( of three original trajectories and three partners ) with two 2-encounters in fig .  [ fig1]b and a single 3-encounter in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c . by shrinking the link connecting the two encounters in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we can see how we deform them into the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c and we use this idea in our ehrenfest - time treatment .          for the calculation of contributions resulting from diagrams differing in encounters we first need to review the notation and the important steps of the corresponding calculation in ref .  .",
    "an encounter of two orbits is characterized by the difference of the stable and unstable coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath41 measured in a poincar surface of section ( pss ) put inside the encounter ; see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in terms of these coordinates the duration of the encounters is given by @xmath42 derived from the condition that the coordinates @xmath43 are only allowed to grow up to a classical constant @xmath44 ( which is later related to the ehrenfest time ) .",
    "the weight function measuring the probability to find these encounters is obtained by integrating over all possible positions where the encounter stretches can be placed and dividing by the volume of available phase space ( in the corresponding closed system ) @xmath45 and further by the durations of the encounters @xmath46 to avoid overcounting the same set of correlated trajectories .",
    "the action difference @xmath47 between the orbits is in general given by a quadratic form of the coordinates @xmath43 determined by where the partner trajectories must pierce the pss s to reconnect in the right way to form a closed cycle .",
    "for example for a 3-encounter one obtains @xcite @xmath48 where the prime denotes that the coordinates are measured in _",
    "one _ pss from the central trajectory .",
    "if we instead measure the coordinates in two _ different _ sections , we obtain @xmath49 where the time @xmath50 denotes the time the particle needs to travel between the two sections .",
    "this leads in the limit of well separated encounters to @xmath51 . from this and from ref .",
    "we can draw the following conclusions for the form of the action difference in the case of an arbitrary number of ( possibly overlapping ) 2-encounters : in the case of @xmath52 well separated 2-encounters we obtain for the action difference @xmath53 .",
    "when these encounters overlap the action difference can differ from the last expression by terms exponentially damped with the time difference between the two sections .    in our treatment , the overall contribution @xmath54 of the two 2-encounters ( depicted in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is obtained by allowing the upper trajectory to possess a minimal length of the first 2-encounter and the lowest one a minimal length of the second 2-encounter .",
    "the middle trajectory , which passes through both encounters has a minimal length given by the maximum of the two encounter times as we allow the encounters to overlap .",
    "however we do not yet allow one encounter to be subsumed into the other so we also set the time @xmath55 between the start of the first encounter and the end of the second to be longer than the maximum encounter time . to write down the semiclassical contribution of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we sum over the number of possible classical orbits using the open sum rule @xcite . converting the time integrals resulting from this rule to time integrals with respect to link durations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath56 where the superscript refers to fig .",
    "we have summed over the possible channels , and @xmath57 with @xmath58 label the links from the channels to the encounters . in ( [ eq8 ] ) where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath61 are the stable and unstable coordinate differences between the two parts of the trajectories piercing through a pss placed in the @xmath11-th encounter .",
    "as explained above , the action difference is given by @xmath62 . by expanding the part of the exponential @xmath63 containing this @xmath50-dependent part into a taylor series one verifies easily that contributions from higher order terms than the leading ( time independent ) one are of higher order in @xmath64 and can be neglected .",
    "this reasoning also holds for diagrams with more than two 2-encounters .    in the first line of ( [ eq8 ] ) we can see that each integral over the links is weighted by its classical probability to remain inside the system for the time @xmath57 which decays exponentially with the average dwell time @xmath24 .",
    "we only want to consider trajectory sets where the _ whole _ diagram remains inside the system , as if any parts were to hit the lead and escape the diagram would be truncated at that point . with the energy dependence in ( [ eq6a ] ) this gives the factors @xmath65 in ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "inside the encounters however we have trajectory stretches that are so close that the conditional survival probability of secondary traversals is 1 and we need only consider the survival probability of one stretch .",
    "if that stretch does not escape then neither will the other .",
    "the energy dependence still depends on the total time so that encounter 1 would lead to the factor @xmath66 . with the overlap ,",
    "encounter 2 would then have a more complicated exponential factor , but because the time @xmath55 ( between the two outer ends of the encounter stretches on the middle trajectory shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) passes through both encounters their survival probability ( of both stretches of both encounters ) can be expressed as the survival probability of a stretch of duration @xmath55 as in the last line of ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the energy dependence instead also requires the extra traversal of the encounters as given by the exponential factor in the middle line of ( [ eq8 ] ) .    performing the integrals in the first line of ( [ eq8 ] )",
    "we have @xmath67 where we have moved all of the ehrenfest - time dependent parts into the factor @xmath68 with the superscript again referring to fig .  [ fig4 ] , @xmath69 here we can also see the connection with the previous ehrenfest - time treatment of such a diagram . when @xmath70 the two encounters separate ( the integrals",
    "can then be further broken down into products ) and this is the case in which the trajectories can be considered to have two independent 2-encounters as in ref .  .",
    "because we choose a different lower limit however , the contribution above also includes some of the diagrams previously treated as 3-encounters in ref .  .",
    "the reason for our choice becomes clear in the following steps .",
    "we first substitute @xmath71 , @xmath72 and then substitute @xmath73 , @xmath74 and perform the @xmath75-integrals using the explicit form of the @xmath42 ( for details of this calculation , see also ref .  ) .",
    "this results in @xmath76 now we substitute @xmath77 and obtain @xmath78 here we split the resulting expression into an @xmath7-independent integral ( or more exactly trivially dependent on @xmath7 ) , that exists due to the energy average that is always contained in our calculations , and an ehrenfest - time or @xmath7 dependent part with @xmath79 . this contains the ehrenfest - time dependence that is expected from ( [ eq5 ] ) , so ( [ eq13 ] ) already shows that the diagrams considered here yield the correct ehrenfest - time dependence .",
    "now we consider the case in which one of the two 2-encounters lies fully inside the other one , which we will refer to as a generalized version of a 3-encounter , as depicted in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    ".        for the ehrenfest - time dependent part we have a similar contribution as in ( [ eq10 ] ) with two differences : first @xmath55 is best defined as the distance between the midpoints of the two different encounter stretches and so it can vary between @xmath80 second the survival probability of the encounters is determined by the longest encounter stretch and is independent of @xmath55 .",
    "the ehrenfest - time dependent part can then be written as @xmath81 performing the @xmath55 integral and following the same steps as for ( [ eq12],[eq13 ] ) , we find @xmath82 this part also shows an ehrenfest - time dependence as expected from ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "note that when performing the @xmath55-integral the result in this case is of course proportional to @xmath83 which contains , after the substitution from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , two times the same terms linear in @xmath13 with different signs that thus cancel each other .",
    "up to now we have concentrated on encounters inside the system , but apart from these diagrams we also need to consider diagrams where the encounters touch the opening as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d - h .",
    "we will , as above , start by considering encounters built up out of two 2-encounters and we focus here on how the calculation of the contribution is changed when encounters move into the lead compared to the treatment of encounters inside the system .",
    "as can also be found in more detail in ref .   when encounters touch the lead one includes in the semiclassical expressions for encounters inside the system an additional time integral running between zero and the corresponding encounter time , which characterizes the duration of the part of the encounter stretch that has not yet been moved into the lead .     of it remains inside the system .",
    "]    we consider two encounters with durations @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the second encounter touching the opening as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d and drawn in more detail in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "as the second encounter enters the lead we now define the time @xmath55 to be from the start of the first encounter until the lead and introduce the time @xmath88 which measures the part of the second encounter that has not yet been moved into the lead .",
    "we also separate the ehrenfest - time relevant contribution @xmath89 in this detailed calculation into two cases : in the first case ( a ) ; @xmath90 ; we have @xmath91 with the additional integral over the time @xmath88 @xmath92 where the limits on the time integrals derive from the fact that the first encounter is not allowed to touch the lead ( this would be included as a 3-encounter ) and that the second must . performing the time integrals this is @xmath93{\\rm e}^{-t_{{\\rm enc},1}(1 - 2{\\rm i}\\epsilon)/\\td } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the first and second term in the square brackets resulting from the upper and lower limit of the @xmath88-integration . in the second case ( b ) ; @xmath94 ; we obtain @xmath95 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the more complicated limits derive from not allowing the second encounter to move further left than the first . after integrating we have @xmath96{\\rm e}^{-t_{{\\rm enc},1}(1 - 2{\\rm i}\\epsilon)/\\td } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\frac{1}{(1 - 2{\\rm i}\\epsilon)}{\\rm e}^{-t_{{\\rm enc},1}(1 - 3{\\rm i}\\epsilon)/\\td } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } - \\left . \\frac{1}{(1 - 2{\\rm i}\\epsilon)}{\\rm e}^{{\\rm i}\\epsilon t_{{\\rm enc},1}/\\td}{\\rm e}^{-t_{{\\rm enc},2}(1 - 2{\\rm i}\\epsilon)/\\td } \\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last line comes from the upper limit of the second @xmath88-integral and has the same ehrenfest - time dependence as before and in line with ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "likewise the upper @xmath88 time limit for case a in ( [ eq17 ] ) leads to the same dependence and we can conclude that the upper limits of the @xmath88-integrations yield contributions similar to when the encounters are inside the system and with the same ehrenfest - time dependence .",
    "the remaining ( lower ) limits of the time integrations in ( [ eq17],[eq19 ] ) give contributions possessing a different ehrenfest - time dependence which however always yield zero in the semiclassical limit due to the fact that the corresponding terms contain no @xmath97 in the exponentials containing @xmath24 . apart from the action difference , the only term depending on @xmath98 is the @xmath99 .",
    "the resulting expression is rapidly oscillating as a function of the energy @xcite and thus canceled by the energy average .",
    "we can repeat this procedure for the remaining diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and see that the contributions are determined by the upper limits of the corresponding @xmath88 integrals . for the diagrams with a generalized 3-encounter ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]g , h ) this follows as for the 3-encounter inside the system but for fig .",
    "[ fig1]e where the two 2-encounters enter different channels ( and possibly different leads ) there is an additional subtlety .",
    "the two encounters are still allowed to overlap , so that during the time @xmath55 the stretch now connecting both channels can always be inside encounters but the individual encounters are not allowed to connect leads at both ends .",
    "these additional possibilities are considered later , where if both encounters connect to the leads at both ends we actually have a band of correlated trajectories ( treated in sec .",
    "[ part2 ] ) and if only one does we have a mixed term ( treated in sec .",
    "[ mixing ] ) . with this organization of the encounters we see that each diagram has the same ehrenfest - time dependence as when the encounters are inside the system , which is in line with ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the reasoning so far in this section proves the form of ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath39 .",
    "first of all , we know that the resulting contribution from the diagrams analyzed contains an overall factor @xmath100 . secondly , the remaining integrals are independent of @xmath7 and thus independent of the ehrenfest time .",
    "thirdly , the diagrams we analyze are the same as the ones analyzed in the rmt - case in the first part of ref .  .",
    "as in the limit @xmath101 we must recover that previous result , this implies that @xmath102 in ( [ eq5 ] ) is indeed given by the rmt - expression .      before proceeding to the general case however , we first want to illustrate how our calculation can be used to obtain , apart from just the ehrenfest - time dependence , the complete dependence on @xmath24 and @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore start for the two 2-encounters from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] from the last expression in ( [ eq13 ] ) and perform first the @xmath103-integral @xmath104 where it is simpler to rewrite the result in terms of the maximum and minimum value of @xmath105 . for calculating the @xmath106-integrals we perform partial integrations ( integrating each time the @xmath107 functions ) and",
    "then perform the resulting integrals from zero to infinity @xmath108 in the first line the additional terms due the partial integration are either zero or cancel due to the energy average .",
    "the final result in the last line of ( [ eq22 ] ) can be also obtained by replacing @xmath109 and @xmath110 and performing the integrals with respect to @xmath111 from zero to infinity .    to evaluate the contribution from the generalized 3-encounter in fig.[fig5 ] we again perform two partial integrations in ( [ eq16 ] ) and obtain @xmath112 where we have also left out the terms from the partial integrations that cancel due to the energy average .    with these results",
    "we can now show how they connect to the rmt - type results .",
    "for this we need to split our diagrams differently and first we need the result for an ideal 3-encounter as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] whose contribution was calculated @xcite to be @xmath113 with the extra factors in ( [ eq9 ] ) it is clear how in the limit @xmath114 this reduces to the rmt - type result for a 3-encounter as in ref .  .",
    "all the remaining contributions should be collected together as two 2-encounters , and as the ideal 3-encounter is included in our generalized 3-encounter we first subtract ( [ eq24 ] ) from ( [ eq23 ] ) @xmath115 before we add the result from our separation of two 2-encounters in ( [ eq22 ] ) we remember that in the treatment we enforce that the first encounter is to the left of the second .",
    "the result in ( [ eq25 ] ) does not have this restriction so we divide by 2 to ensure compatibility and then add the result in ( [ eq22 ] ) to obtain @xmath116 this then reduces to the rmt - type result for trajectories with two 2-encounters when @xmath114 as in ref .  .",
    "the agreement of these results with the previous ehrenfest - time treatment@xcite can be seen as the result in ( [ eq26 ] ) including both the result from two independent 2-encounters as well as most of the contribution of the diagram referred to as a 3-encounter in ref .  . when splitting the contribution in a different way as in ref .",
    "this also leads to terms in both classes that contain different ehrenfest - time dependencies that only cancel when summed together .",
    "although up to now we have just reproduced results from ref .  , the procedure used here has the advantage that it yields a simple algorithm for determining the ehrenfest - time dependence of the corresponding contributions to @xmath117 at arbitrary order .",
    "for our example of @xmath39 we showed how it was possible to split the diagrams into two classes that _ both _ showed the ehrenfest - time dependence as expected from ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "we want now to show how to generalize our way of splitting considered for three trajectories to diagrams containing @xmath37 trajectories .",
    "we start again with the situation in which all of the encounters are inside the system and by considering a case analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , but now involving @xmath37 instead of three trajectories .",
    "we first take a diagram that consists of a ladder of @xmath118 2-encounters so that the central @xmath119 trajectories each contain two encounter stretches while the two outside trajectories only contain one encounter stretch each .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and the encounters are thus characterized by @xmath118 @xmath120-coordinates .        in this case",
    "we obtain for the ehrenfest - time relevant contribution @xmath121 that the @xmath55-integral measuring the time difference between the end points of the two encounter stretches on the middle orbit in ( [ eq10 ] ) is replaced by @xmath119 integrals over times @xmath122 with the same meaning as @xmath55 ; they measure the time difference between the end points of the two ( consecutive ) encounter stretches on the central trajectories containing two encounter stretches .",
    "these times likewise run from the maximum of the corresponding encounter times to infinity .",
    "the survival probability is determined by a single ( artificial ) stretch that runs through all the encounters so that the exponential term describing the @xmath24- and @xmath21-dependence is now given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 are the durations of the @xmath118 individual 2-encounters and the middle exponential compensates for the fact that the middle encounters are traversed by two @xmath57 and that only one traversal should contribute to the survival probability . setting @xmath125 and repeating now the steps of ( [ eq12],[eq13 ] ) we find the ehrenfest - time dependent factor in this case to be @xmath126 again confirming the ehrenfest - time dependence of ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "along with the case in which none of the encounters in the ladder can move completely inside another , we can look at the opposite extreme where all the encounter stretches lie inside of the encounter @xmath52 with the longest duration @xmath127 where @xmath46 are the durations of the @xmath118 individual 2-encounters with one of the two orbits containing the stretch of duration @xmath128 .",
    "this situation is like a generalization of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and we similarly now define the times @xmath57 to be measured between the centers of encounter @xmath11 and the encounter @xmath52 of maximum length ( with @xmath129 ) . here",
    "the same ehrenfest - time dependence @xmath130 follows by taking into account that each time @xmath122 has a range of variation of size @xmath131 and that the @xmath24- and @xmath21-dependent exponential in this case is @xmath132 this yields for the ehrenfest - time dependent factor @xmath133\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\times { \\rm e}^{-{\\rm",
    "i}\\epsilon\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\ln x'_{i}/(\\lambda\\td)}{\\rm e}^{-\\tau\\left(1-{\\rm i } n\\epsilon \\right ) } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] confirming again the ehrenfest - time dependence predicted by ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "of course it is additionally possible to have a mixed form between these two extreme cases .",
    "this means that some 2-encounters only overlap like in the case of a ladder diagram while the others form ` single ' encounters ; see fig.[fig7a ] for a possible diagram .",
    "we then have a ladder of ` combined ' encounters that themselves can be made up of one or more 2-encounters .",

    "this can be seen to come from bands of trajectories that remain correlated with each other for the entire duration of their stay inside the system .",
    "furthermore the fact that no mixed ( between the rmt - type and classical - type ) terms arise is simply due to their opposing classical restrictions .",
    "this lack of mixed terms as well as the classical contribution were previously shown to be more generally due to the preservation of volume under the dynamical evolution and the separation of phase - space into two essentially independent subsystems @xcite .",
    "the separation of the correlation functions into two contributions , which each have a straightforward dependence on the ehrenfest time was previously shown to be responsible for secondary gaps in the density of states of andreev billiards @xcite , but has an equal effect on other transport quantities .",
    "for the transmission eigenvalues ( and their moments ) with no energy dependence we just get a straightforward interpolation between the rmt @xcite and classical values . for the distribution of the wigner delay",
    "times we further see a truncation of the classical ( exponential ) distribution and a shift to higher times of the rmt - type distribution . between the two though a hard gap remains .",
    "the method described in this paper allows for the computation of the ehrenfest - time dependence of the trace of arbitrarily many scattering matrix pairs but only to leading order in inverse channel number @xmath260 .",

    "<S> this enables us to verify the prediction from effective random matrix theory that one part of the correlation function obtains an exponential damping depending on the ehrenfest time , while also allowing us to obtain the additional contribution that arises from bands of always correlated trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ehrenfest - time dependence , responsible e.g.  for secondary gaps in the density of states of andreev billiards , can also be seen to have strong effects on other transport quantities such as the distribution of delay times . </S>"
