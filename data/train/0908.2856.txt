    "therefore , it is important to investigate the properties of the quarkonia in an ideal environment to give a solid foundation , not only on the existence of a bound state but also on their detailed spectral modification such as the mass shift and broadening at finite temperature or density . in this respect ,",
    "it was pointed out that a downward mass shift of @xmath1 in hadronic matter was caused by the decrease of string tension , which had been predicted by lattice qcd , and as such can be a precursor phenomena of the confinement - deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detailed determination of the spectral properties can play a key role in the study of qcd phase transition .",
    "properties of the bound states have been traditionally investigated with quantum mechanical potential models .",
    "it is known that the mass spectrum of heavy quarkonium can be described well by the so - called cornell potential , which implements the coulomb potential at short distance and linearly rising one at long distance @xcite .",
    "this approach can be extended to finite temperature by assuming that all the effects of temperature can be accounted for by the temperature dependent potential @xcite . in this approach , however , how to construct the potential relevant for schrdinger equation is a non - trivial problem and various types have been examined by incorporating properties known from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "although the potential model approach is related to qcd only through the temperature - dependent potential computed with lattice qcd , recent development in weak coupling methods such as pnrqcd @xcite which is an effective field theory of qcd and a resummed perturbative approach @xcite shed a light on more rigorous foundation of the heavy quark potential at finite temperature .    direct evaluation of the quarkonium properties with lattice qcd has been carried out through the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite .",

    ", the perturbative radiative correction term @xmath96 can be large enough to spoil the perturbative expansion .",
    "we therefore impose this term to be less 0.3 at @xmath97 .",
    "the pole dominance should be also imposed on the criteria to preserve the reliability on the extracted property of the pole part of the spectral density .",
    "we determine @xmath98 by requiring the continuum contribution to be less than 30% of the total perturbative term .",

    "@xcite except for the reversed direction of the horizontal axis . here",
    "we draw the lines only within the borel window .",

    "the gluon condensates decrease as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc ] .",
    "this is reflected by the lowered curves obtained for @xmath103 , as in line with the moment sum rule case @xcite .",
    "since the condensate contribution becomes dominant in the ope side at small @xmath89 , one sees great reduction of mass in this region .",
    "then the solid curve , for @xmath103 , shows a minimum at smaller borel mass .",
    "this corresponds to the shift of the minimum of the moment ratio to large @xmath32 in the moment sum rule .",
    "regarding the solid curve as the base line , one sees that decreasing the continuum threshold flattens the curve at large @xmath89 . in this case",
    ", however , reduction of the continuum threshold makes the @xmath98 smaller and thus the resultant borel window becomes narrower .",
    "this is why the dash line ends at @xmath111 gev@xmath109 .",
    "one also sees that the curve is almost flat above @xmath112 gev@xmath109 .",
    "this means that further reduction of the continuum threshold breaks the stability of the borel curve , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mass decreases monotonically and no minimum would exist .",
    "@xmath113 does not change against the reduction of the continuum threshold since it depends only on temperature through the power correction terms in the ope . on the other hand ,",
    "if one increases the width , it raises the mass , especially at low @xmath89 as clearly seen in the short - dashed curve .",
    "one sees that , at @xmath89 far from the @xmath113 , the two lines , one obtained by reducing the continuum threshold and the other by introducing the width , show almost similar flatness . in the present case ,",
    "the rapid rise in the @xmath114 mev gives @xmath115 gev@xmath109 which is much bigger than @xmath116 gev@xmath109 of the @xmath117 gev curve .",
    "however , this depends on the choice of the criterion in the determination of the borel window .",
    "if one tightens the criterion , to 10% power correction for instance , @xmath113 becomes larger and then @xmath99 of the @xmath114 mev will be smaller .",
    "this indicates the difficulty in accurately determining the spectral parameters when one takes into account the change of both the width and the continuum threshold .",
    "nevertheless , one can make the curve flatter by decreasing the continuum threshold without introducing broadening up to a certain temperature .",
    "note that the arrows become shorter as the curve becomes flatter . as explained above , while there is about 50 mev uncertainty in the largest case , it is due to the strong @xmath89 dependence seen in small @xmath89 region",
    ". therefore one should not take these values so seriously .",
    "this situation changes if one goes to higher temperatures .",
    "we plot some examples from @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig : borelexample2 ] .",
    "as the solid line shows , no stability is achieved in @xmath104 gev and @xmath83 case .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in the moment sum rule above @xmath118 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : borelexample ] , reducing @xmath86 decrease @xmath90 especially at high @xmath89 . in this case , however , borel window closes before stability is restored ; @xmath119 occurs .",
    "therefore , one has to increase width to recover the stability . in other words ,",
    "the breakdown of the stability occurring above @xmath4 can now be regarded as the onset of the broadening .",
    "we denote this temperature as @xmath120 , which depends on the channel as we shall see below .",

    "one should also note that @xmath120 depends on the criteria for the borel window .",
    "one can broaden the borel window by relaxing either or both of the criteria .",
    "for example , if one sets the continuum contribution to be less than 50% instead of 30% , @xmath98 becomes larger thus can open the borel window .",
    "indeed such a situation is realized in some cases considered in this paper , as seen in the resultant spectral parameters summarized in tables  [ tbl : sumruleresult_jpsi]-[tbl : sumruleresult_chib1 ] .",
    "when the @xmath99 takes its minimum at the smallest @xmath105 satisfying the criteria , making the borel window larger by relaxing the @xmath98 criterion leads to smaller @xmath105 while retaining the width .",

    "for some cases where @xmath83 always gives the flattest curve , we may use @xmath99 to determine the best @xmath86 value , since the other edge of the borel curve is fixed .",
    "for example , we can safely determine the best @xmath86 by evaluating @xmath99 at @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , though we maintain the criterion for the borel window as explained , we can easily estimate how the best value changes with respect to the change of the criterion .",
    "if one relaxes the pole dominance condition , it extends the borel window to larger @xmath89 therefore continuum threshold giving the best @xmath99 will become smaller . on the other hand ,",

    "since we maintain the same criterion even at different temperatures , the relative in - medium change of the spectral parameters is not affected by the particular choice of the criterion for the borel window .",

    "the correlation between the mass shift and the width does not differ from the other example but the shape of the @xmath99 contour slightly does , reflecting the straight contour of @xmath137 . in these figures , the area surrounded by the @xmath133 or @xmath134 correlation lines and one of the @xmath99 contour can be regarded as a possible region of the mass shift and the width including uncertainty for a given @xmath105 .",

    "let us begin with examining how temperature dependence of the gluon condensates is related to the spectral parameters by looking at the dispersion relation  . the temperature dependence of the ope side [ eq .",
    "] comes from the gluon condensate terms @xmath144 and @xmath145 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : opecof ] , we plot the ope coefficients in eq .  .",
    "one sees that both the scalar gluon condensate contribution and the twist-2 one increase as temperature increases .",
    "these dependencies come from the fact that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are monotonically decreasing functions of the temperature while the coefficients @xmath146 and @xmath147 have always negative sign .",
    "channel @xmath146 can be positive , as understood from eq .  , but we found it is mostly negative for values of @xmath148 corresponding to @xmath92 and @xmath46 retains the property of increasing function of the temperature . ] therefore , up to dimension four operators , @xmath46 in the ope side is always increasing function of the temperature .",
    "one also sees that the expansion coefficients of the @xmath6-wave state are larger than @xmath8-wave s at the same borel mass @xmath89 , as also seen in the moment sum rule case @xcite .",
    "these properties result in the correct mass splitting between the @xmath1 and the @xmath149 states , and induce larger mass shift for the @xmath6-wave states through the derivatives of these coefficient with respect to @xmath79 . from the behavior of the condensate contributions at low @xmath89 ,",
    "one realizes how the location of the borel window in the case of charmonium changes with respect to the temperature . at temperatures close to @xmath4 , @xmath113",
    "is determined by the scalar condensate and thus becomes smaller as temperature increases .",
    "it eventually starts to increase when the twist-2 contribution dominates over the scalar one , @xmath150 .",
    "> from the dispersion relation , where the weight of the integral over the spectral function is positive definite , one obtains the constraint equation for the changes of the spectral parameters against the change of the ope side discussed above . the phenomenological side ",
    "has four parameters ; effective continuum threshold @xmath86 , pole mass @xmath84 , width @xmath85 , and overlap @xmath88 . if only one of these four quantities is allowed to vary as temperature increases , the respective changes of the parameters needed to match the ope side are ,      in practice , all of these quantities can change not only to the expected direction but also to the opposite , as long as the total combined change of the spectral function matches the ope side .",
    "the borel transformation procedure explained in the previous section provides an optimization way to find out the best set of the changes .",
    "we carried out the analyses for the charmonia for various temperatures around @xmath4 .",
    "for a reference , we summarize the results of @xmath21 in table [ tbl : charm_t0 ] .",
    "one sees that the masses are well reproduced by the common parameter set indicated before .",
    "finer tuning on the quark mass , the coupling constant , and the gluon condensate may improve the small discrepancies with the experimental data but we are not intending to do so here since our aim is to investigate the relative change from the vacuum value induced by the medium ."
