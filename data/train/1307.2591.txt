    "<S> we present the derivation of the two - loop gluon regge trajectory using lipatov s high energy effective action and a direct evaluation of feynman diagrams . using a gauge invariant regularization of high energy divergences by deforming the light - cone vectors of the effective action , we determine the two - loop self - energy of the reggeized gluon , after computing the master integrals involved using the mellin - barnes representations technique . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy is further matched to qcd through a recently proposed subtraction prescription . </S>",
    "<S> the regge trajectory of the gluon is then defined through renormalization of the reggeized gluon propagator with respect to high energy divergences . </S>",
    "<S> our result is in agreement with previous computations in the literature , providing a non - trivial test of the effective action and the proposed subtraction and renormalization framework .    _ _ _ . </S>",
