    "plasma outflow from gravitationally bounded stellar objects is a universal phenomenon in astrophysics which is known to occur on a range of different spatial and energetic scales .",
    "gaseous material containing synthesized elements and energy are supplied from the stellar source into the surrounding environment by these outflows .",
    "it is important to study the driving mechanism of the plasma outflow not only for the dynamical evolution of the stellar object itself , but also for the chemical and dynamical evolution of interstellar medium of galaxies .",
    "the pioneering theory of stellar wind , which is the prototype of the astrophysical outflow , was developed by parker ( 1958 ) .",
    "it describes steadily accelerated plasma flow from a high - temperature corona into interstellar space .",
    "weber & devis ( 1967 ) extended parker s wind theory to include magnetic processes by modeling plasma outflows along open magnetic field line . in this model ,",
    "the accelerated stellar wind collides with the interstellar medium and finally forms the shock wave .",
    "the neutron star is known to have a relativistic plasma outflow , called as pulsar wind .",
    "the magnetosphere of rotating magnetized neutron star is filled with charged particles ( goldreich & julian 1969 ; sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "these charged particles flow out steadily along open magnetic field lines through the light cylinder where the co - rotation velocity coincides with the light speed .",
    "the plasma is accelerated to relativistic velocity by converting the rotational energy of the pulsar itself .",
    "the pulsar wind also interacts with the surrounding dense gas ejected from the progenitor stars and causes a termination shock ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "non - steady outflows exist universally in astrophysical systems .",
    "these should be seen as a more general class of outflows than the steady stellar wind .",
    "of these non - steady flows , astrophysical jets are the most studied .",
    "astrophysical jets are collimated bipolar outflows from central objects .",
    "it is believed that magneto - centrifugal and magnetic pressure forces are the most promising power for driving the collimation flow ( blandford & payne 1982 ; uchida & shibata 1985 ; shibata & uchida1986 ) .",
    "the magnetized jet from young stellar objects have a central role in prompting the collapse of molecular clouds and thus is essential for star formation ( machida et al .",
    "2008 ) . the super - massive black holes in active galactic nuclei also powers bipolar jets ( begelman et al . 1984 ;",
    "bridle & perley 1984 ) .",
    "the most energetic event in the universe is the gamma - ray burst , and which is believed to be energized by ultra - relativistic bipolar flows formed when a massive stellar core collapses ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "the non - steady mass ejection event associated with solar flares is called `` coronal mass ejection ( cme ) '' ( low 1996 ) .",
    "the emergence of a twisted magnetic flux tube from below the solar surface , which supplies free energy to the system , triggers flares by magnetic reconnection ( ishii et al .",
    "1998 ; kurokawa et al . 2002 ; magara 2003 ) and drives the associated cmes ( e.g. , mikic & linker 1994 ; shibata et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we can observe non - steady mass ejection phenomena analogous to the solar flare / cme activity in magnetar systems .",
    "the magnetar is a ultra - strongly magnetized neutron star with magnetic field of @xmath5@xmath6 g ( duncan & thompson 1992 , thompson & duncan 1995 ; harding & lai 2006 ; mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "the giant flare observed from the magnetar is surprisingly energetic ( @xmath7@xmath8 ergs ) and is believed to be powered by releasing the enormous magnetic energy stored in the magnetar itself ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; lyutikov 2006 ; masada et al . 2010 ) .",
    "we note that the magnetar giant flare is also associated with an expanding ejecta ( cameron et al .",
    "2005 ; gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ; taylor et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "while the energetic origin of the outflow is different in the various astrophysical systems , there is a characteristic common to all outflow phenomena .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes play a role in powering and regulating the outflow .",
    "it has been a central issue in the study of the astrophysical outflow to specify the mhd process which controls the outflow dynamics ( hayashi et al .",
    "1996 ; beskin & nokhrina 2006 ; spruit 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the physical property and the acceleration mechanism of the outflow powered by the magnetic energy released from the compact stars have not yet been studied sufficiently ( e.g. , komissarov & lyubarsky 2004 ; komissarov 2006 ; takahashi et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the outflow powered by a magnetic explosion on a compact star , such as neutron star .",
    "we investigate its nonlinear dynamics using 2.5-dimensional special relativistic mhd simulations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reveal the characteristics of the outflow which expands from the surface of the compact star into the surrounding medium .",
    "the relativistic effect on the physical properties of the outflow is a special interest of this work because such outflow should be easily accelerated to relativistic velocity .",
    "this paper opens with descriptions of the numerical model in   2 .",
    "the numerical results of our relativistic mhd simulation are presented in   3 .",

    "1983 ) to solve the srmhd equations in the same manner as leismann et al .",
    "the numerical flux across the cell interface is evaluated using the characteristic velocity of the fast magneto - sonic wave obtained from the physical variables in left and right adjacent cells of the interface .",
    "the primitive variables are calculated from the conservative variables following the method of del zanna et al .",
    "we use a muscl - type interpolation method to attain second order accuracy in space , and constrained transport method to guarantee a divergence free magnetic field ( evans & hawley 1988 ) .      for our initial conditions ,",
    "we consider a hydrostatic gas surrounding a central compact star . a dipole magnetic field anchored in the central star threads the external gaseous plasma , and is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the field strength at the equatorial plane on the stellar surface and the radius of the central star respectively .",
    "we assume that the temperature of the surrounding medium is inversely proportional to the distance from the centroid of the star @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reference temperature of the surrounding gas on the surface of the central star .",
    "then the spatial distribution of the gas density and pressure in hydrostatic equilibrium are @xmath28 where @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the reference density and pressure of the surrounding gas on the central star , and @xmath32 is the central stellar mass .",

    "the convectively stable condition for the surrounding gas is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the entropy ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) . when adopting equations ( 12)(15 ) ,",
    "this can be reduced to @xmath36 we should set the parameter @xmath33 to be larger than @xmath37 in our calculations for maintaining the surrounding plasma being convectively stable . on the other hand , models with @xmath38 can not be solved using our simulation code because the physical variables become too small to be resolved in the calculation domain .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 surveyed in the following is thus restricted to the range between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the ratio between the mass and radius of the central star is a fundamental parameter which characterizes the system , and is fixed as @xmath41 .",
    "this is the typical value for the neutron star .",
    "all the numerical models we examined here are controlled by two non - dimensional parameters , which are the power - law index @xmath33 of the hydrostatic surrounding medium and the plasma beta on the equatorial surface of the central star @xmath42 .    as we show in   3.2 ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the magnetically driven outflow is controlled by the initial alfven velocity ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the larger value of initial plasma beta ( @xmath44 ) provides the slower evolution of the outflow , which is not appropriate for extensive parameter survey .",
    "in addition , the conservative mhd scheme used in our code is not good at solving the problem with small values of the initial plasma beta",
    ". hence we survey the @xmath45-dependence of the outflow properties within the range @xmath46 .",

    "since the parameter @xmath53 varies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and @xmath45 varies from @xmath54 to @xmath55 in our models , the relativistic representations of the sound and alfvn velocities can be well approximated by their non - relativistic forms as stated above . using description ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , the sound and alfvn velocities are @xmath56    in the following , we mainly use the non - relativistic form of the sound and alfvn velocity for convenience .",
    "the normalization units in length , velocity and time are chosen for all the models as radius of the central star @xmath25 , light speed @xmath57 , and the light crossing time @xmath58 .",

    "we investigate two different energy injection patterns . in both cases ,",
    "the shearing velocity @xmath70 increases linearly from zero to @xmath71 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 and is held at constant velocity @xmath71 until @xmath74 .",
    "after @xmath75 , the velocity of the shearing motion is kept constant at @xmath71 in case a , and is terminated suddenly in case b.    the amplitude of the shearing velocity is an important parameter which controls the outflow dynamics , and should be widely surveyed .",
    "however , we focus only on the typical case with the fixed shearing velocity of @xmath71 in this paper . in this case , the shearing motion supplies the magnetic energy which is roughly comparable to the thermal energy of the system .",
    "the dependence of the outflow dynamics on the initial field strength and the density profile of the surrounding gas is our interest in this paper .",
    "we will study the impact of the shearing velocity on the outflow dynamics in the separate paper .",

    "a nonuniform grid is adopted in the radial direction .",

    "the largest grid size @xmath83 is empirically determined to correctly capture the the sharp relativistic shock which propagates through the outer calculation domain .",
    "the number of the grid points is set as @xmath84 in the radial and @xmath85 in the @xmath10 direction for all the models .",
    "the shearing motion imposed on the equatorial surface of the compact star generates the toroidal magnetic field by stretching the initial dipole field .",
    "the kinetic energy of the shearing motion is then immediately converted to magnetic energy .",
    "the magnetic energy amplified above the stellar surface initiates the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "while the shearing motion is added artificially to break the initial equilibrium of the system , it is physically modeling the supply of the magnetic helicity and energy from the stellar interior into the magnetosphere , like as the flux emergence in the sun .    in the solar flare / cme process",
    ", the emergence of the tightly twisted magnetic flux plays a triggering role in breaking the equilibrium of the corona ( ishii et al .",
    "1998 ; kurokawa et al .",
    "2002 ; magara 2003 ) .",
    "we use the shearing motion instead of the flux emergence for the sun as the process modeling energy and helicity injection in our calculations , because actual energy and helicity injection processes are still veiled in mystery in the context of compact stars .",
    "since the inner boundary condition in our models is mathematical over - determined ( see bogovalov 1997 ) , there exists a discontinuity in the radial velocity at around the stellar surface in our calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a depicts the radial profile of the radial velocity of the model where @xmath86 and @xmath87 as a reference . here",
    "we focus on the inner boundary region ( @xmath881.2 ) and the time - steady state of @xmath89 .",
    "the filled square , triangle and circle represent the radial velocity profiles at different polar angles @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "this addresses that there exists a velocity discontinuity near the inner boundary .",
    "in addition , the discontinuity at around the high latitude stellar surface has a larger amplitude than that around the equatorial region where the outflow is mainly accelerated in our models as shown in   3",
    ".    figure  [ fig1]b shows the meridional distribution of the density and poloidal velocity near the inner boundary at the steady state of the model same as figure  [ fig1]a . the orientation and length of each arrow denote the direction and magnitude of the poloidal velocity vector at each meridian point .",
    "the grey contour is a logarithmic representation of the density normalized by its inner boundary value .",
    "the radial flow across the inner boundary is induced especially at around the high latitude stellar surface although the radial velocity is set to be zero at the inner boundary .",
    "this induced outgoing radial flow supplies the plasma into the calculation domain .",
    "the temporal evolution of the total mass contained in the calculation domain is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] in the same model .",
    "the vertical axis is normalized by the initial total mass of the plasma distributed in the entire domain .",

    "the mass injection rate is roughly @xmath93 at the initial evolutionary stage until @xmath94 , but @xmath95 at the steady state after @xmath96 .",
    "since the density of the plasma near the stellar surface is maintained at close to the initial value by the mass inflow across the inner boundary as shown in figure  [ fig1]b , the alfven and sound velocity ( @xmath97 ) are not relativistic there and an order of @xmath71 at the steady state .",

    "the magnetic pressure resulted from the toroidal magnetic field , which is generated by the shearing motion around the stellar equatorial surface , initiates and accelerates the quasi - spherical outflow .",
    "the driven outflow is strongly magnetized , in which the magnetic pressure composed mainly of the contribution for the generated toroidal field dominates the gas pressure , and carries dense plasma away from the central star .    in the equatorial region where the magnetized outflow is energized , it is natural from the physical perspective to consider that the magnetization parameter ( @xmath104 ) grows due to both the mass ejection and the continuous injection of the magnetic energy .",
    "however , the magnetization parameter near the stellar surface is maintained at a lower value than unity during the computing time as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .    in this figure , the spatial distribution of the magnetization parameter ( left ) and density ( right )",

    "the magnetization @xmath106 near the stellar surface is less than unity .",
    "the mass inflow from the inner boundary region plays a role in reducing the magnetization parameter to less than unity .    although the magnetic energy is strongly amplified and the outflow carries a large portion of the gas around the equatorial region , the rapid amplification of the magnetization parameter is prevented because the dense plasma maintained above the high - latitude stellar surface is continuously supplied into the equatorial region .",

    "the numerical results are well reproduced by this analytic scaling .",

    "the physical property of the magnetized outflow studied here is different from that found in the similar work on solar cme by mikic & linker ( 1994 ) .",
    "this would be because , in their work , the shearing motion which models the energy injection in the solar flare / cme process is much slower than the alfvn velocity in comparison with our models .",

    "<S> the nonlinear dynamics of outflows driven by magnetic explosion on the surface of a compact star is investigated through special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt , as the initial equilibrium state , a spherical stellar object embedded in hydrostatic plasma which has a density @xmath0 and is threaded by a dipole magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the injection of magnetic energy at the surface of compact star breaks the equilibrium and triggers a two - component outflow . at the early evolutionary stage , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic pressure increases rapidly around the stellar surface , initiating a magnetically driven outflow . </S>",
    "<S> a strong forward shock driven outflow is then excited . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion velocity of the magnetically driven outflow is characterized by the alfvn velocity on the stellar surface , and follows a simple scaling relation @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when the initial density profile declines steeply with radius , the strong shock is accelerated self - similarly to relativistic velocity ahead of the magnetically driven component . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it evolves according to a self - similar relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the lorentz factor of the plasma measured at the shock surface @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> purely hydrodynamic process would be responsible for the acceleration mechanism of the shock driven outflow . </S>",
    "<S> our two - component outflow model , which is the natural outcome of the magnetic explosion , can provide a better understanding of the magnetic active phenomena on various magnetized compact stars . </S>"
