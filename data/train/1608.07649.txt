    "approximately 70 years have passed since h. b. g. casimir published his famous paper @xcite , which mentioned a new kind of the force caused by the distorted vacuum fluctuation of quantized electromagnetic field and called casimir force , there are many attentions to research the casimir force in both experimental and theoretical sides in many scopes of physics : massless scalar field @xcite , quark matter @xcite , quantum liquids @xcite , nanotechnology and many others @xcite .    in field of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) ,",
    "the casimir force is considered as the quantum fluctuations on top of ground state , which corresponds to phononic excitations @xcite . for the noninteracting bec the casimir force",
    "is vanished @xcite and in limit of weakly interacting bec this force is nonzero @xcite .",
    "besides , the casimir force in bec at finite temperature was considered in refs .",
    "although the casimir force of a bec has not been measured yet but a successful for casimir - polder force in both theory @xcite and experiment @xcite are the motivation for physicists in bec field .    to our understanding ,",
    "the study of the casimir force in two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is so far still absent although many aspects have been researched , for example , statics properties @xcite , dynamical excitations @xcite , _ etc_. the goal of this paper is to remedy this gap . to do this we consider a becs is confined to a parallel plate geometry with the size @xmath0 and inter - distance is @xmath1 , which satisfies condition @xmath2",
    "this means that our system is limited in the volume @xmath3 as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we assume that two plates perpendicular to @xmath4-axis .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we investigate the casimir energy and casimir force of becs .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ sec:3 ] to close the paper .",
    "let us begin with the idealized binary mixture of bose gases , without external field , given by the lagrangian density @xcite , @xmath5-{\\cal v},\\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which , the interaction potential has the form @xmath6 where , for species @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the wave function of the condensate , which plays the role of order parameter , @xmath9 are atomic mass and chemical potential , respectively . the strength of repulsive inter- and intraspecies interaction determined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the @xmath13-wave scattering length , relevant at low energies .",
    "we consider here both cases : the system is miscible when @xmath14 and immiscible if @xmath15 @xcite .    by setting @xmath16 one",

    "bogoliubov dispersion relation for condensate @xmath7 reads as @xmath21 in long wavelength limit , eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) reduces to @xmath22 which corresponds to goldstone bosons due to @xmath23 breaking .",
    "this quasi - particles propagate in the same way as photon of electromagnetic field in original casimir s calculations @xcite , of cause , in our case , the velocity of quarsi - particles equals to the sound velocity.    next we consider the system in one - loop approximation . in this limit , the thermodynamical potential can be written as @xcite , @xmath24 where we used the notation @xmath25 and @xmath26 is matshubara frequency .",
    "for the first term in right hand side of ( [ 1loop ] ) , combining ( [ potential ] ) and ( [ profiles ] ) one get @xmath27 after renormalization , the chemical potentials can be found based on ( [ 1loop ] ) by taking derivative the the thermodynamics with respect to density particle @xmath28 , @xmath29 these equations lead to @xmath30 hence , reinserting ( [ chemical ] ) into ( [ f0 ] ) one obtains the energy density @xmath31 it is obviously that this result coincides to well - known result of lee and yang for single component bose gas @xcite .",

    "note that we are studying on casimir energy and casimir force at zero - temperature caused by quantum fluctuation , therefore the temperature - dependence term can be dropped out of ( [ secondterm ] ) . the free energy in one - loop approximation ( [ 1loop ] ) can be rewritten as the one for single component bose gas @xcite , @xmath35 with @xmath36 here @xmath37 is one - loop counter term , which cancels the ultraviolet divergences @xcite .    for sake of simplicity , we introduce healing length @xmath38 as the unit of length , dimensionless wavelength @xmath39 and the order parameters are scaled @xmath40 with @xmath41 is bulk density of component @xmath7 . in this respect , eq .",
    "( [ term1 ] ) has the form @xmath42 now let us investigate the casimir energy of becs confined between a pair of parallel plates .",
    "let @xmath43 being inter - distance ( in unit of healing length ) of double plates , we have to quantize the momentum component perpendicular to the plates as follows @xmath44 this means that the periodic boundary condition is employed in eq .",
    "( [ quantize ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the integral over momentum perpendicular to the plates is replaced by a summation @xmath45 applying eqs .",
    "( [ change ] ) and ( [ quantize ] ) into ( [ term11 ] ) we arrive @xmath46 with @xmath47 as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , within dirichlet boundary condition applied to parallel plates , casimir energy related to the free energy in one - loop approximation for each unit area satisfies @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is called casimir energy .",
    "the summation in ( [ term12 ] ) can be evaluated by using abel - plana formula @xcite , @xmath50 note that the first term in ( [ abel ] ) is divergent but it is absorbed by the counter - term .",
    "the term @xmath51 in ( [ abel ] ) cancels out .",
    "the result is @xmath52 by changing the order of integrations in ( [ casimir ] ) , the @xmath53-integral can be performed and we express ( [ casimir ] ) in the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 is density of state function for component @xmath7 , which has the form @xmath56 , & \\hbox{when $ 0\\leq x<\\overline{l}_j\\phi_j$ ; } \\\\",

    "( [ energyfinal ] ) and ( [ dos ] ) , it is included in @xmath57 [ see eq . ( [ profiles ] ) ] .",
    "based on this we can calculate casimir force , which is defined as @xmath58 combining ( [ defineforce ] ) with ( [ energyfinal ] ) and ( [ dos ] ) one finds @xmath59 this equation shows that :    - for ideal bose gases @xmath60 the casimir force is vanished as discussed in @xcite for single bec .    - in case interspecies interaction is absent ( two components are miscible ) @xmath61 , the system behaves as the single bec .",
    "we consider now the casimir force in large inter - distance limit . in this limit",
    ", we can check that integral in ( [ energyfinal ] ) get exponentially decay and is going to zero very fast . by introducing @xmath62 the first region of density of state in ( [ dos ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath63,\\label{large}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath64 . expanding ( [ large ] ) in power series around @xmath65 one arrives to @xmath66.\\label{large1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plugging ( [ large1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ energyfinal ] ) and keeping in mind that we are considering here the weakly interacting system so @xmath67 , one is able to evaluate the integral in ( [ energyfinal ] ) and result is @xmath68 with @xmath69 is sound speed of condensate @xmath7 . from eqs .",
    "( [ defineforce ] ) and ( [ energyj ] ) the casimir force can be found in this limit @xmath70     at @xmath71 ( red ) , 1 ( green ) and 1.5 ( blue ) . ]    in order to illustrate above calculations , we made some numerical computations .",
    "if we introduce a dimensionless quantity @xmath72 and consider the case in which two - phase coexistence in equilibrium state , eq .",
    "( [ profiles ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath73 ( in their unit ) has to be satisfied @xcite . for binary mixtures of bose gases",
    "we request that @xmath74 , however the definition ( [ k ] ) is equivalent to @xmath75 since @xmath76 is fixed for a given system and all three scattering lengths can be changed largely independently by using the technique of feshbach resonances @xcite , so @xmath77 can run from zero to infinity for the case immiscible . for simplicity",
    "we study on the symmetric case with @xmath78 : in fig .",
    "[ energya ] one expresses the casimir force as a function of the effective inter - distance @xmath79 at several values of @xmath77 , including miscible @xmath71 , demixing @xmath80 and immiscible regimes @xmath81 .",
    "we can see that as @xmath79 increases the casimir force approaches to zero very fast and there is a singular at @xmath82 ; the casimir force as a function of @xmath83 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ en2a ] for immiscible case and versus @xmath77 for miscible case in fig .",
    "[ en2b ] , we can see the suitability with fig .",
    "[ energya ] .",
    "it also shows that for full strong segregation @xmath84 the casimir force going to zero .",
    "in the foregoing section we calculated the casimir energy and casimir force of becs at zero temperature within framework of field theory in one - loop approximation and the periodic boundary condition is employed for @xmath4-direction .",
    "the our main results are in order    - casimir energy of system is summation of the one for each component and is calculated via the density of state . for large inter - distance",
    "the casimir energy decreases as @xmath85 .",
    "this result is the same as those for single component bec",
    ".    - casimir force is defined as the first derivative of casimir energy with respect to plate separation . imposing the periodic boundary condition",
    "this force is repulsive . the same as the casimir energy , the casimir force @xmath86 equals to summation of @xmath87 corresponding to component @xmath7 . at large @xmath88",
    "this force is decay to zero as @xmath89 and this force is also vanishing in case of full strong segregation @xmath90 . for the case of non - interspecies interaction @xmath61 the system behaves as two distinguishing single bec .",
    "there is also an important result , casimir force ( and , of cause , casimir energy ) will be suppressed when @xmath77 tends to infinity and @xmath88 is finite . in mathematically , from eq .",
    "( [ symmetry ] ) one can expand ( [ force ] ) in power series @xmath91.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation confirms the result presented in fig . [ energyb ] for @xmath92 .",
