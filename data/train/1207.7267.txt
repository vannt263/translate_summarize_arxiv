    ", it has been known that the formation rate per unit mass of lmxbs ( alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) is orders of magnitude greater in globular clusters than in the rest of the galaxy ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) . as millisecond pulsars ( msps )",
    "are generally believed to be descendants of lmxbs , it becomes natural that @xmath280% of the known msps are detected in globular clusters  ( cf .",
    "manchester et al .",
    "theoretical arguments have long asserted that the formation of lmxbs ( and therefore their decedents msps ) is made efficient through frequent stellar encounters . using the x - ray populations in various globular clusters  unveiled by the chandra x - ray observatory , pooley et al .",

    ", @xcite found that the number of msps in a globular cluster is correlated with its stellar encounter rate , as well as its metallicity .",
    "this finding provides the first observational evidence of the dynamical origin of msps .",
    "this is easy to understand since msps are descendants of lmxbs .    in this paper",
    "we review main results revealed by high - energy @xmath0-ray  observations of galactic globular clusters , which were mainly contributed by data taken using the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the fermi gamma - ray space telescope since its launch in june 2008 . towards the end of the paper",
    "we also discuss the recent tev observations as well as observational prospects related to gravitational wave experiments of globular clusters .",
    "the readers are referred to an earlier review by  @xcite from a more theoretical aspect .",
    "observations by egret in the 1990s did not result in any positive detection from a couple of globular clusters , including 47  tucanae that hosts the largest number of known msps at that time  @xcite .",
    "later lat observations found that the egret upper limit for 47  tucanae is only a factor of two higher than the measured flux .",
    "the launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has enabled the detection of @xmath0-ray  emission from a number of globular clusters .",

    "msps as a class had already been established as @xmath0-ray  emitters  @xcite , and they are believed to be the only stable @xmath0-ray  sources in globular clusters .",
    "the observed @xmath0-rays  from the direction of 47  tucanae are naturally attributed to the msps in the cluster  @xcite .",
    "this assertion is strengthened by the measured cutoff at @xmath22.5  gev in the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ figure:47_tuc_ter5 ] ) that is close to the average cutoff energy obtained for nearby , @xmath0-ray  emitting msps in the galactic field  @xcite . from the average @xmath0-ray  luminosity of individual msps in the galactic field ,",

    "it is therefore generally believed that the @xmath0-rays from globular clusters  do not come from a single msp , but are collective emission originated from the entire msp population in a cluster .",
    "assuming that the average @xmath0-ray  efficiencies of msps in 47 tucanae are similar to nearby msps , the number of msps needed to give rise to the observed flux from 47  tucanae ( @xmath22.5@xmath710@xmath8  erg  @xmath9s@xmath5  @xcite ) is about 50 , a factor of @xmath22 higher than 23 msps in 47  tucanae detected in radio survey .",
    "such discrepancy can be understood as incomplete radio surveys of msps , e.g. , due to viewing angle effect .",

    "there are some indications from cumulative radio luminosity distributions that terzan  5 may indeed contain more msps than 47  tucanae  @xcite .",
    "if the number of msps resided in terzan  5 is smaller than @xmath25 times that of 47  tucanae , environmental factors such as the background soft photons ( whose number is much higher in terzan  5 than in 47  tucanae ) , as suggested by  @xcite and @xcite , may explain the higher @xmath0-ray  luminosity of terzan  5 .",

    "the energy flux of terzan  5 is higher than 47  tucanae by a factor of @xmath23 , which might explain the apparent discrepancies in the 1020  gev band for these two globular clusters .",

    "of the ten galactic double ns binaries ( or candidates ) , psr  b2127 + 11c , itself a dynamically formed one , is the only one situated in a globular cluster , m  15 , a @xmath0-ray  source candidate  @xcite . due to the high encounter rate and high concentration of binaries in globular clusters , there should be a much larger population of double ns binaries in globular clusters  that have escaped timing measurements .",
    "therefore , the actual merger rate of galactic and extragalactic double ns binaries may be even higher , thereby increasing the chance to detect gravitational waves from globular clusters .",

    "<S> over the last few years , the fruitful data provided by the large area telescope aboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has revolutionized our understanding of high - energy processes in globular clusters , particularly those involving compact objects like millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . </S>",
    "<S> gamma - ray emission between 100  mev to 10  gev has been detected from more than a dozen globular clusters  in our galaxy , most notably 47  tucanae and terzan  5 . </S>",
    "<S> based on a sample of known gamma - ray globular clusters , empirical relations between the gamma - ray luminosity and properties of globular clusters  such as stellar encounter rate , metallicity , as well as optical and infrared photon energy density in the cluster , have been derived . </S>",
    "<S> the gamma - ray spectra are generally described by a power law with a cut - off at a few gev . </S>",
    "<S> together with the detection of pulsed @xmath0-rays  from a millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster , such spectral signature gives support that @xmath0-rays  from globular clusters  are collective curvature emission from magnetospheres of msps within the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> alternative models in which the inverse - compton emission of relativistic electrons accelerated close to msps or the pulsar wind nebula shocks have also been suggested . </S>",
    "<S> observations at @xmath110  gev by fermi / lat and atmospheric cherenkov telescopes like h.e.s.s .- ii , magic - ii , veritas , and cta will help to settle some questions unanswered by current data . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss tev observations of globular clusters , as well as observational prospects of gravitational waves from double neutron stars in globular clusters .    </S>",
