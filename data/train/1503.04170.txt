    "radiation diffusing from the expanding core can not prevent @xmath30 from catching up @xmath32 , because @xmath89 .",

    "@xmath98 corresponds to the velocity of the shock when it enters the wind . for simplicity",
    ", we took in this analytical discussion a flat profile for the stellar envelope , but we verified numerically that our results hold for more realistic density profiles , such as @xmath99 for a red supergiant envelope .",

    "a cs then forms in front of the expanding core .",
    "in other words , for a given wind density , and below a given shock velocity , the kinetic energy between @xmath30 and @xmath32 that can be radiated through @xmath32 is not sufficiently large to compensate for the dilution of photons due to the spherical geometry of the problem . for progenitors with the above parameters , this yields @xmath101 , which is typical of rsg shock velocities . for such progenitors , a cs forms before sb .",
    "for some wrs , larger shock velocities can occur and a cs forms before sb only for larger values of @xmath102 : for example , the mildly relativistic shock of sn  2006aj does not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ conditioncs ] ) with @xmath103 .",
    "more precisely , the scenario discussed here applies when the circumstellar wind is sufficiently dense to be optically thick , but not so thick that inequality  ( [ conditioncs ] ) is violated . for progenitors with steady winds ( density @xmath99 ) , this typically corresponds to moderately thick winds with e.g. @xmath104 .",
    "let us mention that in the hypothetical case of a progenitor surrounded by a thick wind with a density profile flatter than @xmath0 at @xmath100 ( e.g. due to variations in time of @xmath3 before the explosion ) , this scenario can also be valid for significantly larger values of @xmath105 : it is valid as long as the condition @xmath106 is satisfied close to the core .",
    "red supergiants or wolf - rayet stars with relatively high mass - loss rates prior to the explosion are good candidates : moderately thick winds with @xmath104 correspond to @xmath3 in the range from a few  @xmath107 to @xmath108 for typical values of @xmath109 , @xmath2 and @xmath98 for rsgs and wrs .",
    "for example , type  ibc supernova sn  2008d / xrf  080109 may have been an event in which a cs is formed before sb : @xcite suggest that sn  2008d is consistent with the explosion of a wr in a moderately thick wind , and that the progenitor underwent a steady but enhanced mass - loss during the last @xmath110 days .",
    "very interestingly , the parameters derived by  @xcite for sn  2008d ( @xmath111 , @xmath112kms@xmath45 , and @xmath113 close to the star ) marginally satisfy inequality  ( [ conditioncs ] ) for @xmath114 cm .",
    "this gives an additional and important reason to search for sn  2008d - like events in the future .",
    "the rate of such events depends on the likelyhood for a star to undergo enhanced mass - loss during the last few weeks or years preceding the supernova .",
    "in contrast , progenitors of type  iin supernovae are not expected to satisfy our scenario , since eq .",
    "( [ conditioncs ] ) , with typical values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for type  iin , implies upper limits on @xmath98 well below the actual shock velocities . for progenitors with significant mass - loss rates ,",
    "the radiation - dominated shock should always survive the transition from the core to the optically thick wind , and the picture would then be a conventional one : in such cases , photons are supplied by the immediate downstream of the rds in the thick part of the wind .",
    "for example , type  iin supernova sn  2010jl does not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ conditioncs ] ) because of the large mass - loss rate @xmath115 @xcite .    in stellar cores ,",

    "underlying assumptions for an equivalent code can be found in  @xcite .",
    "our main result does not strongly depend on the density and temperature profile of the hydrostatic core , and we take as an example those for the rsg used in  @xcite .",

    "[ numsim ] . at such an early time , the cs downstream temperature is only @xmath127kev because the radiation still provides most of the fluid acceleration in its upstream , but we find the discontinuity in @xmath23 to grow and the cs processes a significantly larger fraction of @xmath128 at larger @xmath13 . for other parameter values ( smaller @xmath129 for @xmath3 , @xmath2 fixed ) , radiation plays a smaller role , allowing the cs to emit in hard x - rays ( @xmath130skev ) before its photons break out . the formula @xmath131 and conclusions of the previous section have been verified by scanning the parameter ranges .",
    "we find that for significantly larger @xmath132m@xmath122yr@xmath45 and the same core profile , the rds survives the transition to the wind .",

    "varying @xmath3 and @xmath2 , also corroborates the picture announced in the previous section .",
    "we verified numerically that once the cs is formed ( even when this happens at @xmath90 ) , it survives to @xmath137 in winds with @xmath99 : if the shock does not sufficiently slow down at @xmath72 and if the wind density does not increase with @xmath13 , no process reduces the difference in velocities between the cs immediate downstream and immediate upstream down to a subsonic value . in the simulations ,",
    "this difference in velocities is , on the contrary , found to grow at @xmath138 .",
    "assuming conservatively a magnetic field strength at the cs similar to that at the stellar surface , @xmath139 g  @xcite , and wind densities @xmath140g@xmath141 , the cs is super - alfvnic .",
    "once it is formed , cr acceleration may start .",
    "coulomb losses for suprathermal particles are sufficiently small here and do not prevent them from entering diffusive shock acceleration and being accelerated . however , for wrs with @xmath142m@xmath122yr@xmath45 , such losses start to inhibit cr acceleration before sb . some findings of @xcite and @xcite can be transposed to our study , yet we deal here with a shock propagating in denser regions of the wind . assuming bohm diffusion for crs at the cs  @xcite , and equal dwell times in the downstream and the upstream , one finds a typical acceleration time @xmath143 for protons .",
    "this time can be optimistic when the discontinuity in velocity at the shock is still small due to smoothing by radiation . however , magnetic field amplification at the shock due to the non - resonant hybrid ( nrh ) instability  @xcite plays a role in the opposite direction by diminishing @xmath144 and thereby facilitating cr acceleration , see  @xcite for a detailed study .",
    "magnetic field amplification is ( constantly ) driven by the escape of the highest energy crs in the upstream of the collisionless shock , see  @xcite .",
    "for the ranges of parameter values that are relevant here , the typical growth time of the nrh instability is smaller than the damping time of the turbulence by the radiation field , which energy density is @xmath145 .",

    "the growth rate of the fastest growing mode of the nrh instability is equal to @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the cr current density which drives it  @xcite .",

    "we find that , from the _ beginning _ of sb , the fraction of the energy emitted in x - rays is already roughly comparable with that in softer photons : from @xmath174% to more than a half , with the largest fractions also corresponding to the highest maximum x - ray energies .",

    "the fact that outer layers of the thick wind at @xmath138 may have been mostly accelerated by the cs implies that the energy _ radiated _ at sb may be @xmath179 .",

    "during a core - collapse supernova , a radiation - dominated shock propagates through the progenitor star .",
    "if the surrounding wind is optically thin , this shock stalls when it reaches the outer layers of the stellar core . in the upstream , the circumstellar material",
    "is then accelerated by escaping photons from shock breakout to a velocity roughly @xmath120 , where @xmath13 is the distance to the centre of the progenitor .",
    "the outer layers of the shocked core ram supersonically into these slower layers of the wind , and a collisionless shock is expected to form during or on the time scale of supernova shock breakout .",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for detailed studies .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated the case of supernovae occuring in thick winds . in this case",
    ", the formation of a cs should also occur no later than during or on the time scale of shock breakout from the outer layers of the optically thick part of the wind .",
    "we have demonstrated here that for some astrophysically - relevant progenitors surrounded with thick winds , a collisionless shock forms well before breakout , providing new ways to study invisible layers of their winds and to constrain stellar evolution theories . in such cases ,",
    "the rds has been found to stall when entering the optically thick part of the wind , notably because of shock curvature .",
    "photons are then mostly supplied by the shock propagating in the core , and the wind is not sufficiently dense to compensate for the @xmath0 dilution of photons in the wind . on the contrary , for progenitors where the rds survives the transition from the core to the wind , such as for type iin supernovae ,",
    "photons are mostly supplied by the immediate downstream of the shock in the wind .",
    "we have discussed , in section  [ pa ] , the onset of particle acceleration at the cs .",
    "for example , we predict that for some red supergiants surrounded with thick winds , a fraction of secondary high - energy neutrinos from crs can arrive @xmath162 hours before photons from shock breakout , and more neutrinos are produced later in the post - shock breakout phase .",
    "we find that the cs forms after the rds exits the core , and before breakout , for progenitors with shock velocities @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively denote the wind velocity , mass - loss rate and radius of the hydrostatic core .",
    "the wind has to be sufficiently dense to be optically thick but not excessively . for progenitors with steady winds ( @xmath99 )",
    ", this corresponds to moderately thick winds , where e.g. ) can also be satisfied for @xmath194 if e.g. the wind density profile happens to be flatter than @xmath0 at @xmath100 . ]",
    "progenitors of type  iin supernovae are expected to have too dense winds to form cs when the rds leave their cores .",
    "however , wolf - rayet stars or red supergiants with either dense winds or enhanced mass - loss prior to the explosion are better candidates . for example , type  ibc supernova sn  2008d / xrf  080109 has been interpreted by  @xcite as the explosion in a moderately thick wind of a wr star , undergoing an enhanced mass - loss during its last @xmath110 days .",
    "interestingly , the parameters inferred by  @xcite for sn  2008d make it marginally consistent with the above condition .",
    "this is another important motivation to search for similar events . in the future",
    ", one can notably use them to study the formation times of collisionless shocks with respect to the photon flashes at breakout .    more generally , supernovae occurring in dense winds are promising targets for multi - messenger studies .",
    "the detection of their uvs , x - rays , @xmath12-rays and tev neutrinos will allow one to test a wide variety of physical and astrophysical phenomena in extreme conditions , such as particle acceleration , magnetic field amplification and shock physics .",
    "finally , studying cr acceleration in dense winds is important , because it should lead to a better understanding of the knee in the cr spectrum , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
