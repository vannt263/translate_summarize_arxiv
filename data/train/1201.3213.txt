    "lately , many dynamical solutions of @xmath0-brane system in different dimensions have been studied using various approaches based on string theory @xcite . these solutions",
    "have varying applications and shed light on many different aspects of dynamics of the higher - dimensional spacetime .    in a brane world scenario @xcite ,",
    "the brane dynamics is very important .",
    "if we construct a cosmological scenario based on a brane world scenario from a fundamental unified theory , we may find a brane inflation model@xcite or an alternative model such as a cyclic universe@xcite in the early stage of the universe .",
    "however , in most of those models , a probe test brane is assumed and the dynamics of our universe is discussed in a lower - dimensional effective theory .",
    "no back reaction is taken into account . since the existence of branes cause inhomegeneity of spacetime , a simple truncation of extra dimensions for an effective theory may lead us to a wrong answer , except for kaluza - klein comcatification .",
    "we may have to discuss such a dynamics in the original higher dimensions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss a brane dynamics by use of exact solutions in higher dimensions . in order to find appropriate solutions",
    ", we adopt the most classical riddles of higher - dimensional dynamics such as intersection , t - duality , and the relation , if any , between them in a situation as simple as possible while still more or less tractable . for this aim",
    ", we explore a higher - dimensional time - dependent model that is a relatively close analog of ordinary supergravity theories .",
    "such a model is the @xmath0-brane model with a @xmath3-field @xcite .",
    "this model is possible to exhibit time dependence where all harmonic functions in the metric depend on time . in the intersecting brane system ,",
    "the warp factors arise from field strengths .",
    "then the dynamics of a system composed of @xmath4 branes can be characterized by @xmath4 warp factors arising from @xmath4 field strengths .",
    "unfortunately , since we have ever found that among these warp factors for m - branes and d - branes , only one function can depend on time @xcite , there are little - known solutions in which all harmonic functions depend on time for m - branes and d - branes .",
    "these are some of the main properties that we would like to understand in cosmological solutions .",
    "many other interesting models contain cosmological solutions , as a result of which they are not such close relatives of supergavity theories if all warp factors in the metric depend on time @xcite .",
    "another important property that the @xmath0-brane model is believed to share in common with ordinary kaluza - klein compactification is a limit of cosmic time in which the time dependence in the warp factor is the dominant contribution , and the effects of field strengths vanish . for these cosmological @xmath0-brane solutions , though there are realistic cosmological model in the four - dimensional effective theory @xcite , nobody knows the @xmath0-brane solution which exhibits an accelerating expansion of our universe in the viewpoint of original higher - dimensional supergravity @xcite .",
    "understanding of this result , perhaps via a new kind of ansatz for fields , is probably well out of reach with present methods , but may offer the best long term hope of a much better understanding of cosmological evolutions than we now possess .",
    "note that ten - dimensional string theory is believed to have the cosmological solution with accelerating expansion of our universe in the four - dimensional effective theory .",
    "this fact is important in the cosmological model of string theory or m - theory @xcite .    to study the dynamics of the @xmath0-brane",
    ", we follow a path that has been followed for a variety of d - brane in ten - dimensional type ii supergravity models : we construct a configuration of dynamical branes with @xmath3-field in a supergravity theory that realizes the string theory of interest at low energies , and then we find the cosmological solutions using the t duality map between the type iia and type iib superstring theories . a method of doing this in the case at hand",
    "will be described in the sections [ sec : d3d5 ] and [ sec : dp ] .",
    "we establish by a geometrical argument a new result which has not been guessed previously : the two kinds of metric functions depend on time as well as the coordinates of the transverse space to the intersecting brane for the d@xmath2- and d@xmath0-branes in the supergravity theory .",
    "a dependence of angles in the ten - dimensional metric is obtained via the t duality map .",
    "these dynamical solutions are a straightforward generalization of the bound state of a static d@xmath2- and d@xmath0-branes system with a dilaton coupling @xcite .",
    "we consider in detail the construction yielding the d3-d5 brane .",
    "we also provide the brief discussions for other d@xmath2-d@xmath0 brane system in section [ sec : dp ] . in section [ sec :",
    "cosmology ] , we describe how our universe could be represented in the present formulation via an appropriate compactification @xcite .",
    "we show that there exist no accelerating expansion of our universe , although the conventional power - law expansion of the universe is possible . to illustrate this",
    ", we construct cosmological models for the d@xmath2-d@xmath0 brane system , which is relevant to the ordinary ten - dimensional type ii string theory .",
    "we give the classification of the d@xmath2-d@xmath0 brane system and the application to cosmology .",
    "we then discuss the dynamics of two d@xmath0 branes with smeared d@xmath5 branes ( or the dynamics of two universes ) in sec [ sec : collision ] .",
    "if there exists one uncompactified extra dimension ( d6-d8 brane system or smeared d@xmath2-d@xmath0 brane systems @xmath6 ) and two brane systems have the same charges , the solution describes a collision of two brane systems ( or two universes ) , , which is similar to the result in @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : discussions ] is devoted to conclusion and remarks .",
    "we discuss the dynamical solutions for d3-d5 brane system in the string theory .",
    "the starting point is a d5-brane which carries an electric charge of the 7-form field strength . then its hodge dual gives the magnetic 3-form field strength , which 2-form potential is easily expressed by the coordinates of the transverse space of the d5-brane .    for the d3-d5 brane system ,",
    "the equations of motion of the ten - dimensional type iib theory in the einstein frame are written as where @xmath7 is the hodge operator in the ten - dimensional spacetime , and we define here @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the ns 2-form , rr 2-form , and rr 4-form , respectively .",
    "the scalar field @xmath11 and the gauge field strengths are given by where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the volume form , and the three form @xmath14 satisfies here @xmath15 denotes the hodge operator on @xmath16 .",
    "performing the same procedure as in the previous section , we find that the field equations are reduced to where @xmath17 is the laplace operators on the space of @xmath16 , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the ricci tensors of the metrics @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath24 in more detail , where @xmath25 are the five - dimensional euclidean metric . in this case",
    ", a solution for the warp factor @xmath26 can be obtained explicitly as where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constant parameters .",
    "if the branes exist at the origin of @xmath16 space , introducing a radial coordinate @xmath31 by we find that the function @xmath26 is expressed as where @xmath32 is the line element of four - dimensional sphere , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are constants . in the limit @xmath36 , the metric gives",
    "while the dilaton is given by hence the ten - dimensional metric with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 becomes a warped @xmath41 spacetime .",
    "the dynamical solution can be obtained by the same procedure of the delocalization and rotation on a d2-brane .",
    "let us single out two orthogonal planes @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "if we apply the procedure of the delocalization and rotation on a d2-brane with respect to the @xmath42 plane , followed by t - duality map ( [ d4:duality : eq ] ) , we can obtain the solution for a d3-d1 brane , where the rotation angle is given by @xmath44 . after repeating the same procedure of the delocalization and rotation on a d3-brane with respect to the @xmath43 plane - rotating by @xmath45 to @xmath43 - , followed by t - duality map @xcite we can construct the solution of the d0-d2-d4-brane system ( [ d024:warp : eq ] ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath46 is the coordinate to which the t dualization is applied , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 denote the coordinates other than @xmath46 .    by smearing @xmath50 space , @xmath51 space , and some of @xmath16 space ( @xmath52 dimensions)and compactifying them",
    ", we can construct the type u2 isotropic and homogeneous three space as our universe .",
    "we can also discuss collision of branes ( or universes ) .                                      n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos , g. dvali , phys .",
