    "se10a investigated the authenticity of this seb and argued that its presence was neither due to measurement error nor due to small number statistics .",
    "se10a used the black hole ( bh ) masses of shen et al .",

    "both those references have made two key assumptions .",
    "they have assumed a tight relationship between the radius of the emitting region and the agn continuum luminosity in the form of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "they have also assumed a relationship between the characteristic virial velocity of the gas emitting a particular emission line , @xmath4 , and the single - epoch fwhm of the same line of the form @xmath5 fwhm .",
    "se10a argued that departures from the above assumptions sufficient to affect the presence of a seb were unlikely , although they acknowledged that the slope of a seb is dependent upon the bh mass scaling relation used ( their  4.5.2 ) .",
    "peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that the blr virial velocity can be characterized by either the line dispersion @xmath6 or the fwhm measured directly from the emission line profile in an rms spectrum where @xmath7 is the _ _ i__th spectrum of the n spectra that compose the reverberation data for one object .",

    "obtained during a reverberation mapping study ( see , e.g. , figure 3 of peterson et al .",
    "this result has been interpreted as arising from linear relations between virial velocity and each of the rms fwhm and rms @xmath6 .",
    "the same study shows that the line dispersion measured from a mean spectrum is also linearly proportional to the virial velocity ; however , the fwhm measured from a mean spectrum may not be linearly proportional to the virial velocity ( see e.g. , figure 4 & 5 of peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) . since single - epoch spectra are more similar to a mean spectrum than an rms spectrum , wang et al .",

    "the gap between the red dot - dashed line ( showing an eddington ratio of one ) and the black dot - dashed curve ( tracing the 95th percentile of the observed distribution ) is called the sub - eddington boundary .    in figure [ fig:8quasar_mass_luminosity_plane_original ] panels ( a ) to ( h )",

    "this plot shows no evidence for the existence of an seb with slope different from unity . instead , in the lower redshift bins there is a sub - eddington boundary",

    "comparing figure [ fig : quasar_mass_luminosity_plane]a with figure [ fig : quasar_mass_luminosity_plane]b or comparing figure [ fig:8quasar_mass_luminosity_plane_original ] with figure [ fig:8in1_zbin_lbol_mbh_rh_calibration ] shows that two bh mass samples from the same sdss data set yield different distributions in the mass - luminosity plane .",
    "the fact that different mass - scaling relations were used for these samples suggests that the seb is sensitive to the mass calibration or the line width indicator used , or both .",

    "shen et al . ( 2008 ) fit mgii  as a sum of two gaussians , one constrained to have fwhm@xmath141200  , and use the fwhm of the broader gaussian as the mgii  fwhm .",
    "it is convenient to assume that quasar emission lines can be modeled as sums of two gaussians ; however , the validity of this gaussianity assumption has not yet been fully investigated .",
    "there are only a few studies on the non - gaussianity of quasar broad emission lines in the context of bh mass estimation .",
    "peterson et al . (",
    "2004 ) have suggested using the line dispersion and not the fwhm of the emission profile for mass measurements for several reasons including the gaussianity assumption .",
    "collin et al . (",
    "2006 ) have used both the fwhm and rms line dispersion of reverberation - mapped agn to investigate the gaussianity of the lines .",
    "they reported two classes of objects according to the value of @xmath15 : pop .",
    "i with values below the gaussian ratio of @xmath16 and pop .",
    "ii with values above it .",
    "peterson ( 2007 ) have also reported that for h@xmath1 this ratio spans @xmath17 with an average ratio of @xmath18 , indicating that the emission lines may not be well fit by single or double gaussians .",
    "we have investigated the significance of the gaussianity assumption for bh mass estimates using the line dispersion @xmath6 of all objects from rafiee & hall ( 2011 ) and the fwhm reported by shen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the same objects . in figure",
    "[ fig : histogram_fwhm2sigma_ratio ] , we have plotted the histogram of the resulting mgii  @xmath19 distribution .",
    "we report a range of @xmath20 with a mean value of @xmath21 and a mode of @xmath22 ( the blue dash - dotted line in figure [ fig : histogram_fwhm2sigma_ratio ] ) .    in figures [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh]a and [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh]b , we show contour plots of the distribution of these two mgii  line width indicators as a function of their ratio .",
    "there is a strong correlation of fwhm with the ratio fwhm/@xmath6 , but no significant correlation for @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh]c plots fwhm versus @xmath6 .",
    "this contour plot is another way of demonstrating that the distribution of fwhm/@xmath6 ( e.g. , between the five reference lines plotted ) as a function of @xmath6 shows only moderate variation from an average distribution , while as a function of fwhm the distribution of fwhm/@xmath6 shows great variation .",
    "recall that peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that while the virial velocity in the bh mass relation is well characterized by @xmath6 , it is less well characterized by fwhm (  1 ) . combining that result and ours",
    ", we can say that @xmath6 is a good representation of the virial velocity regardless of the line shape ( as crudely measured by fhwm/@xmath6 ) , whereas fwhm is not .",
    "this change in the typical ratio between fwhm and @xmath6 with fwhm again calls into question the use of a bh mass relation calibrated to the fwhm .    in figure",
    "[ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh_bhmass ] , we show contour plots of quasar bh masses versus @xmath19 for three scenarios .",

    "figure [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh_bhmass]a shows that the dependence of fwhm on the fwhm/@xmath6 ratio means that a broader range of bh masses are found using fwhm - based estimation as compared to @xmath6-based estimation ( figure [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh_bhmass]b ) .",
    "figure [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh_bhmass]c shows that the recalibration of fwhm - based masses discussed in the next section helps to reduce the discrepancy between the range of bh masses estimated using fwhms and that estimated using @xmath6 values .",
    "we have used numerous different methods to estimate the best - fit parameters of two- and three - parameter bh mass scaling relationships . however , we base our conclusions on the mlinmix_err method ( kelly et al . 2007 ) , also used by wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which we report in table [ tab : bentz_wang_mj_3logfit ] .",
    "the mlinmix_err method is preferred over other methods because it is the only fitting method which takes intrinsic scatter and uncertainties in both parameters into account .",
    "it should be the default fitting method in such cases , though its results may not differ significantly from other methods for two - parameter fits .",
    "we also use another metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo simulation ( mcmc ; haario et al .",
    "2006 ) which gives very similar results to linmix_err and mlinmix_err ; they both use the bayesian approach to the regression problem but use different sampling algorithms .",
    "the mcmc and mlinmix_err ( and linmix_err ) simulations yield confidence levels as well as potential outliers and the distribution of the acceptable parameters and their associated errors within the parameter space .",
    "other methods used in previous studies are less sophisticated .",
    "for example , the bces method ( akritas & bershady 1996 , e.g. , used by mclure & dunlop 2004 , kaspi et al . 2005 , vestergaard et al .",
    "2006 ) considers bivariate correlated errors and a possible intrinsic scatter but it does not report that scatter . a quantified value of the intrinsic scatter is available from the fitexy - t02 method ( tremaine et al . 2002 ,",
    "e.g. , used by kaspi et al .",
    "2005 , vestergaard et al .",
    "however , fitexy - t02 does not account for the bivariate correlated errors in the fitting process . nonetheless , for convenience and to illustrate the large dispersion which results from applying non - optimal fitting algorithms , we report the results from all these methods in table [ tab : re_fitting_results_bentz ] .",

    "another potential cause of differences between bh mass datasets is the value of @xmath1 used for the luminosity dependence in the mass calibration equation . the se10a mass scaling relations in h@xmath1 , mgii  and civ  used @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , whereas for mgii  we use @xmath48 in rafiee & hall ( 2011 ) and @xmath49 for the recalibrated three - parameter relationship above . even assuming a perfect correlation between fwhm and @xmath6 , for two quasars of luminosity differing by a factor of 10 for which our method measures the same mass , se10a would obtain a mass higher by 0.11 or 0.12 in the log for the higher luminosity quasar .",
    "that systematic difference will decrease the slope of the upper envelope of the quasar distribution in the mass - luminosity plane , although not by enough to explain the full deviation from unity of the seb slope in se10a .",

    "the monochromatic luminosity is little affected by the shape of the line ( see figure [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh]d ) , while the fwhm clearly depends on the shape ( see e.g. , figure [ fig : contour_fwhm2sigmaratio_vs_shen_rh]a ) .",
    "a heavy weight given to the luminosity in the scaling relationship reduces the effect of the sensitivity of the fwhm to the line shape .",
