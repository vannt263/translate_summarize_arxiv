    "x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are close binaries that contain a relatively un - evolved donor star and a neutron star or black hole that is thought to be accreting material through roche - lobe overflow .",
    "material passing through the inner lagrangian point moves along a ballistic trajectory until impacting onto the outer regions of an accretion disk .",
    "this material spirals through the disk , losing angular momentum , until it accretes onto the central compact object , where x - rays are emitted from inner disk regions .",
    "much of the optical emission in xrbs arises from reprocessing of x - rays by material in regions around the central compact object .",
    "light travel times within the system are of order 10s of seconds . optical variability may thus be delayed in time relative to the x - ray driving variability by an amount characteristic of the position of the reprocessing region in the binary , which depends in turn on the geometry of the binary .",
    "the optical variability may be modelled as a convolution of the x - ray variability with a time - delay transfer function .",
    "this time delay is the basis of an indirect imaging technique , known as echo tomography , to probe the structure of accretion flows on scales that can not be imaged directly .",
    "echo mapping has already been developed to interpret lightcurves of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , where time delays are used to resolve photoionized emission - line regions near the compact variable source of ionizing radiation in the nucleus ( horne , this volume ) . in agn",
    "the timescale of detectable variations is days to weeks , giving a resolution in the transfer functions of 1 - 10 light days @xcite . in xrbs",
    "the binary separation is light seconds rather than light days , requiring high - speed optical / uv and x - ray lightcurves to probe the structure of the components of the binary in detail .",
    "the detectable x - ray and optical variations in the lightcurves of such systems are also suitably fast",
    ".    we present a simple geometric model for the time - delay transfer functions of xrbs , using a synthetic binary code .",
    "we analyze correlated x - ray and uv variability in groj1655 - 40 , using our computed transfer functions , to constrain the size , thickness and geometric shape of the accretion disk in the system .",
    "in the standard model of reprocessing , x - rays are emitted by material in the deep potential well of the compact object .",
    "these photoionize and heat the surrounding regions of gas , which later recombine and cool , producing lower energy photons . the optical emission seen by a distant observer",
    "is delayed in time of arrival relative to the x - rays by two mechanisms .",
    "the first is a finite reprocessing time for the x - ray photons , which for this work is assumed to be negligible @xcite and the second is the light travel times between the x - ray source and the reprocessing sites within the binary system .",
    "the light travel times arise from the time of flight differences for photons that are observed directly and those that are reprocessed and re - emitted before travelling to the observer .",
    "these delays can be up to twice the binary separation , obtained from kepler s third law , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the binary separation , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the masses of the compact object and donor star , @xmath4 is the orbital period . in lmxbs",
    "the binary separation is of the order of several light seconds .",
    "the time delay @xmath5 at binary phase @xmath6 for a reprocessing site with cylindrical coordinates ( r , @xmath7 , z ) is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the inclination of the system and @xmath10 is the speed of light .",
    "the dynamic response function is found by considering how a change in x - ray flux , @xmath11 , drives a change in the reprocessed flux .",
    "we can define the dynamic time delay transfer function to be    @xmath12 \\ , d \\omega(\\vec{x},\\phi ) \\",
    ", \\delta ( \\tau - \\tau(\\vec{x},\\phi))\\ , , \\label{dynamic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the geometric time delay of a reprocessing site at position @xmath14 , see ( [ delayeqn ] ) .",
    "we have developed a code to model time delay transfer functions based on determining the contributions from different regions in the binary . in this section",
    "we describe the models used to construct the individual regions of the binary ; the donor star , the accretion stream and the accretion disk .",
    "the code uses distances scaled to the binary separation in a right - handed cartesian coordinate system corotating with the binary .",
    "each surface panel is a triangle , characterized by its area @xmath15 , orientation @xmath16 , position @xmath14 and temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the donor star is modeled assuming it fills its critical roche potential , so that mass transfer occurs via roche lobe overflow through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "optically thick panels are placed over the surface of the roche potential .",
    "the panels are triangular so that the curved surfaces of the binary are mapped more accurately than is possible using 4-sided shapes @xcite .",
    "the panels , when unirradiated , are assigned an effective temperature @xmath18 given by the spectral type of the donor star .",
    "the accretion stream is modeled by following the ballistic trajectories of 4 test particles .",
    "the ` width ' and the ` height ' of the stream ( its extent in the y- and z - directions respectively ) is determined by the initial positions of the test particles .",
    "the stream is symmetric about the x - y plane .",
    "the unirradiated accretion stream is assumed to have a constant temperature @xmath19 along it s length and the effects of irradiation are considered in the same way as those of the donor star .",
    "the disk thickness is assumed to increase with radius from 0 at @xmath20 to h@xmath21 at @xmath22 , with the form , @xmath23 where the parameters are the inner and outer disk radii , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in units of r(l1 ) , the half thickness of the outer disk @xmath26 and the exponent @xmath27 which describes the overall shape of the disk .",
    "the temperature structure of the un - irradiated disk is that of a steady state disk , in the absence of irradiation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the temperatures of the outer and inner disk respectively .",
    "the effective temperature of a region at a distance r from the x - ray source , assumed in our model to be a point source located at the centre of the accretion disk , is found from the accretion luminosity for a typical lmxb , @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the temperature , @xmath34 the albedo , @xmath35 the efficiency , @xmath2 , the mass of the compact object , @xmath36 the accretion rate onto the compact object , @xmath37 is the size of the compact object and @xmath38 is the distance between the compact object and the irradiated panel .",
    "this is normalised using the binary separation , a , the distance between the centres of mass of the stars , as is the coordinate system for the binary .",
    "the irradiation of the binary takes place in three stages .",
    "the first stage is to calculate the temperature structure of the binary in the absence of any irradiation .",
    "this is done with characteristic temperatures for the donor star and the accretion stream and disk .",
    "the temperature structure of the disk is assumed to that for an unirradiated disk as given in  ( [ disktemp ] ) .",
    "the surface panels of the binary exposed to x - rays are determined by projecting the binary surfaces onto a spherical polar representation of the sky , as it appears from the x - ray source .",
    "each triangular panel is mapped to the sky starting with the one furthest from the source and ending with the panel closest .",
    "those panels remaining visible and unocculted on the sky map are irradiated .",
    "the change in effective temperature of a panel is scaled by the projected area with respect to the x - ray source at a distance @xmath38 from the source .",
    "hence the temperature after irradiation is given by ,    @xmath39    where @xmath17 is the temperature of the panel , @xmath40 the angle between the line of sight from the central source and the normal to the surface of the panel and @xmath41 is the unirradiated effective temperature of the panel .",
    "the second stage is to irradiate the binary with the constant component of the x - ray flux .",
    "this component of the x - ray flux is equated to the mean effective temperature of the x - ray source , as given in  ( [ tempx ] ) , where @xmath42 .",
    "the third and final stage is to repeat stage two with @xmath43 , which represents irradiating the binary with a time varying component .",
    "the difference between stages two and three represents the temperature change of the panels due to the time varying component of the x - ray flux alone , @xmath44 .",
    "the irradiated regions of the binary can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ binaries ] , where the left hand panels show a typical x - ray binary , using binary parameters based on those of scorpius  x-1 , viewed from an inclination of 60@xmath45 .",
    "the response of a panel to the variable component of the irradiating x - ray flux is given by , @xmath46 p\\!\\left(\\lambda\\right ) i\\!\\left(u,\\alpha\\right ) d\\omega\\!\\left (   \\vec{x } , \\phi\\right ) d\\lambda.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this response is substituted into the expression for the dynamic response given in  ( [ dynamic ] ) .",
    "the resulting time delays are mapped onto a time delay grid to produce our time - delay transfer function .",
    "examples of this transfer function can be seen in the right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ binaries ] .",
    "the time delay of donor star can be seen to change with binary phase in the individual images , whereas the accretion disk remains constant throughout the binary orbit .",
    "this effect can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ echophase ] , where the individual transfer functions have been trailed in orbital phase to create an echo - phase diagram , showing clearly how the time delays of the individual components change with binary phase .",
    "we have used these model transfer functions to constrain the geometric parameters for the soft x - ray transient groj1655 - 40 .",
    "the x - ray data was taken with the pca onboard _ rxte _",
    "on june 8 1996 , simultaneous with the _ hst_data .",
    "these lightcurves are shown in the top and middle panels of fig.[lightcurves ] respectively .",
    "the data were previously fitted with causal and acausal gaussian transfer functions and found to have a mean 14.6 @xmath47 1.4 seconds , with a rms of 10.5 @xmath47 1.9 seconds @xcite .",
    "we have used our model x - ray binary code to predict transfer functions , using the known binary parameters for groj1655 - 40@xcite .",
    "the trial transfer functions are convolved with the x - ray lightcurve to create a synthetic reprocessed lightcurve .",
    "the badness of fit is found between the synthetic and observed reprocessed lightcurves and minimized to find the best - fit values for the size , thickness and shape of the accretion disk .",
    "the synthetic lightcurve from the best - fit transfer function is shown by the thick line in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ lightcurves ] , while the bottom panel shows the residuals of the fit .",
    "the best - fit model transfer function is shown in fig .",
    "[ trans ] , together with the best - fit gaussian transfer function from @xcite .",
    "we find that the disk extends to 67% of the way to the inner lagrangian point , is geometrically thick , with an opening angle @xmath48 14@xmath45and is somewhat flared .",
    "this has the effect of shadowing the donor star from much of the irradiation .",
    "we have used the time delays observed between the x - ray and optical / uv variability in x - ray binaries to echo - map the irradiated regions .",
    "we have developed a code to simulate the time - delay transfer functions for such systems and find that , in the case of the sxt , groj1655 - 40 , there is evidence for a geometrically thick outer accretion disk that shields the innerface of the donor star from irradiation .    while the method of echo - tomography of x - ray binaries is still in its infancy ,",
    "we have shown that with just a small amount of data , from co - ordinated observing campaigns using ground - based and satellite observatories , this technique can reveal interesting insights into the geometry of x - ray binaries .",
    "furthermore this technique has the promise of probing the structure and geometry of such systems on scales unobtainable with any other current technique ."
