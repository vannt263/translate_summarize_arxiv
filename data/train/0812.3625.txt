    "the evaluation of multiloop feynman diagrams is currently one of the most important problems in quantum field theory .",
    "thanks to the development of analytical techniques in high order perturbative calculations , it has become possible to compare precision experimental measurements with the theoretical models that try to explain them .",
    "there are several of these techniques , and some of the best known can even be found in textbooks agr , vsm . one that is not particularly used but which nevertheless has advantages for the evaluation of some complicated feynman diagrams is called negative dimension integration method ( ndim ) .",
    "the basic foundations of ndim were initially suggested in the work of halliday and ricotta @xcite , which using the dimensional regularization prescription @xmath0  make an analytical continuation of the dimension @xmath1 into negative values , something which can be done since the feynman integrals are in fact analytic in arbitrary dimension @xmath1 . in a previous work @xcite we proposed that a more appropriate name for this technique should be integration by fractional expansion ( ibfe ) , representing better its mathematical and physical basis .",
    "the purpose of the ibfe technique is to transform the schwinger integral parametric representation of a specific feynman diagram into an equivalent mathematical structure , which contains several summations and kronecker deltas and which we call multiregion expansion ( mre ) of the diagram .",
    "this name comes from the fact that this particular expansion is made around the values zero and infinity simultaneously , and that once the expression is summed using the kronecker deltas , these expansions become explicitly separated . in general the number of summations is bigger than the number of deltas that are generated , and in this case there are several different ways of summing using the kronecker deltas , in fact @xmath2 different forms , where @xmath3 is the number of kronecker deltas and @xmath4 the number of sums .",
    "each one of these forms give rises in general to generalized and multivariable hypergeometric functions .",
    "several authors have used and formalized this method , with a wide variety of applications to mainly one loop @xcite and two loop @xcite diagrams . in a previous work we presented a optimization of this technique @xcite , which allows to evaluate more complex diagrams and even certain families of @xmath5 loop diagrams . in this work",
    "we will show that is possible to improve the efficiency of the ibfe method when it is applied in a modular form to a diagram , that is applying it iteratively to subgraphs or modules that contain one or more contiguous loops of the same diagram .",
    "the procedure consists in replacing the schwinger integral parametric representation of each module by its corresponding mre , and simultaneously the diagram is reduced topologically into simpler graphs .",
    "this reduction allows to get the mre of the complete diagram , as a product of functions that we have called @xmath6-@xmath7 functions ( associated to @xmath8 loop subgraphs ) , each of them being an mre related to one of the modules that are present in the diagram .",
    "since each module can have different masses distributed in different ways in its propagators , there exist several @xmath8-@xmath7 functions depending on the particular configuration of masses in the propagators .",
    "the optimization that is reached when applying the ibfe method in this way to a diagram consists in a reduction of the obtained mre with respect to the one that is reached when the diagram is considered with all its loops simultaneously . in order to explain the technique in detail , we start with the analysis of the simplest topology that can constitute a subgraph of a feynman diagram : the one loop module ( subgraph ) , the bubble diagram , which is going to be the basis that will be used to derive @xmath9-@xmath7 functions , useful to evaluate a variety of feynman diagrams .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe how to easily obtain the schwinger parametric representation associated to a feynman diagram , whose mathematical structure is the starting point for the application of the ibfe technique . here",
    "we present the basic elements of the integration method , and a more rigorous extension is given in the appendix . in section iii",
    "we briefly review the conventional way to deal with this type of diagrams , which is loop by loop .",
    "this will provide a direct test for the method proposed here .",
    "later , in sections iv and v we define and deduce the @xmath10-@xmath7 functions of the bubble module , for all the possible mass and momentum configurations , which are a total of eight functions : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "finally , in section vi we develop several applications of the proposed modular procedure , which will be compared with its equivalent mre obtained from an application of the ibfe technique considering all loops at the same time .",
    "in what follows we will briefly describe the algebraic elements that are needed to understand the technique .",
    "the ibfe integration technique is applied directly to the schwinger parametric representation of a diagram , and therefore it is important to have a simple algorithm to obtain this representation , which is what we will do in this subsection .",
    "let us consider a generic topology @xmath13 , which represents a feynman diagram in a scalar theory , and let us suppose that the graph has : @xmath14 propagators , each one associated to the masses @xmath15 ; @xmath5 loops , associated to the independent internal momenta @xmath16 ) ; and @xmath17 independent external momenta @xmath18 .",
    "using the dimensional regularization prescription we can write the momentum space integral expression that represents the diagram in @xmath19 dimensions :    @xmath20    in this expression the @xmath21 symbol represents the momentum of the @xmath22 propagator , whose dependence in general is given as a linear combination of external and internal momenta .",
    "we also define @xmath23 as the set of propagator indices or powers , and which are considered to have arbitrary values . after introducing schwinger s parametrization",
    "it is possible to evaluate the momentum integrals as gaussian integrals , and the result of this operation is schwinger s parametric representation of @xmath24 , which in the general case is going to be given by an expression of the form :    @xmath25    for simplicity we have introduced the notation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is defined as :    @xmath28    the function @xmath29 and the coefficients @xmath30 are @xmath5-@xmath31 and @xmath32-@xmath33 homogeneous polynomials ( symanzik or kirchhoff polynomials @xcite ) respectively , in the schwinger parameters .",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to determinants related to a matrix that we have called matrix of parameters @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of the coefficients @xmath30 is that they are symmetric @xmath35 , which is due to the commutativity of the internal product between the independent external momenta associated to the graph @xmath13 .",
    "these determinants are defined through the following expressions :    @xmath36    @xmath37    as can be seen , the determinants are associated to submatrices of the matrix of parameters @xmath34 , which is symmetric and of dimension @xmath38 .",
    "the actual form of this matrix can be easily obtained when @xmath24 is parameterized and the internal products of all the ( internal and external ) momenta associated to @xmath39 are expanded , arriving at a quadratic form .",
    "the coefficients of such an expansion correspond to the matrix elements @xmath40 . for a better understanding of this process",
    "let us define for convenience the momentum:@xmath41with which one can build the @xmath42-@xmath43 @xmath44^{\\mathbf{t}}$ ] . using this definition the following matrix structure",
    "is generated in the integral , after the parametrization application and before the loop momenta integration :    @xmath45    and from which we can identify the symmetric matrix @xmath34 .",
    "this technique can be introduced directly by considering the integral expression for the gamma function .",
    "the idea is to obtain operational rules , which will allow us later on to work with generalized complicated structures of this type of integrals , such as schwinger s parametric representation of a generic feynman diagram @xmath46 .",
    "let us analyze the following integral structure :    @xmath47    where the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are arbitrary .",
    "expanding the integrand we get :    @xmath50    where we have defined the factor :    @xmath51    now the integral evaluation will not be done in the usual way , but we define the following operational relation :    @xmath52    which makes @xmath53 to be an identity :    @xmath54    for convenience we introduce the following notation :    @xmath55    where the parenthesis @xmath56 has implicit the constraint associated to the kronecker delta .",
    "this identity is the first fundamental formula of the integration method ibfe . with the previously defined notation",
    ", equation @xmath53 can be written in the following way :    @xmath57    which corresponds to the multiregion expansion ( mre ) of the factor @xmath58 .",
    "on the other hand , starting from the application of equation @xmath59 and later equation @xmath60 to an arbitrary multinomial , we find the second fundamental formula that the method uses .",
    "this expresses the fact that a multinomial of @xmath4 terms can be written as a mre , in such a way that it contains simultaneously all the possible expansions with respect to the ratio of the different terms that are present in the multinomial .",
    "this mre can be written in the following form :    @xmath61    where the definition of the factor @xmath62 has been generalized to:@xmath63      once the parametric representation of the diagram @xmath46 has been obtained , the following step is finding its mre , and for this it is necessary to expand the integrand starting with the exponentials if they exist , and then expanding all the multinomials that the procedure is generating according to formula @xmath64 .",
    "this expansion process stops when finally there is only one term , which is a product of all the schwinger parameters . at this point",
    "all that is left is to replace the integrals according to formula @xmath60  into its equivalent @xmath56 .",
    "the result is the mre of the feynman integral @xmath13 considered in @xmath24 . in the case of a general topology characterized by @xmath65 different mass scales , @xmath66 propagators , @xmath5 loops and a minimal quantity @xmath67 of invariants associated to scalar products of the independent external momenta , then the general form of the mre of @xmath13",
    "is given by the following expression :    @xmath68    where we can identify the following quantities :    * @xmath69 multiplicity or number of sums that are present in the mre of diagram @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath82 number of propagators or equivalently number of parametric integrations , which the method transforms into @xmath83 kronecker deltas .",
    "* @xmath84 total number of mres performed over the integrand of the parametric representation , which in turn generates @xmath85 constraints or equivalently @xmath86 kronecker deltas .",
    "this only refers to multinomial expansions that are present in the parametric integral .    in order to find the solutions it is necessary to evaluate the sums that are present in @xmath87 , using for this purpose the existing constraints between the sum indices , represented by the @xmath88 kronecker deltas",
    "there are several ways to do this evaluation , and in fact the number of different ways to evaluate the mre of @xmath13 using the kronecker deltas is given by the combinatorial formula :    @xmath89    each of these forms of summing will generate as a result a term in the solution of @xmath13 , which corresponds to a generalized hypergeometric function , and whose multiplicity is given by :    @xmath90    in general it is not always possible to use the @xmath91  kronecker deltas to evaluate a similar number of sums , since this will depend on the combination of sum indices for which the sum is going to be done .",
    "if this happens , these cases simply do not generate contributions to the solution .    in simple terms",
    ", the idea of the method is to generate finally an expansion that represents the diagram @xmath13 , the mre of @xmath13 , characterized by a multiplicity @xmath4 in combination with @xmath92 kronecker deltas . from this",
    "it is possible to get the solution in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions , series of multiplicity @xmath93 whose arguments usually correspond to ratios between two characteristic energy scales of the diagram , or in the more general case include sums of unitary argument .",
    "many diagrams contain bubble type insertions in the propagators , which in the massless case can be directly reduced to a propagator and a factor which is a ratio of gamma functions .",
    "this result is straightforward and is very useful for an iterative or loop by loop reduction of topologies or subtopologies built in terms of bubble type insertions .",

    "just as in this example , it is possible to use the @xmath9-@xmath7 functions in generic diagrams whose propagators contain bubble type corrections and its variations , which simplifies considerably the search of an mre of certain diagrams and its solutions .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to apply ibfe to loop by loop recursively built subgraphs and find the respective mre in terms of the @xmath9-@xmath7 functions defined above .",
    "nevertheless , the flexibility of ibfe goes beyond that , and it is possible to generate also @xmath8-@xmath7 functions or equivalently module functions that consider two or more loops simultaneously . such a module , with @xmath8 loops , will lead to a growing number of @xmath8-@xmath7 functions when one takes into account the different possibilities of distributing the propagator masses of the @xmath8-@xmath7 module .",
    "in general to work modularly is advantageous for reducing diagrams , since it simplifies the search of the mre . nevertheless ,",
    "if the idea is to have less algebraic manipulations and a minimal expression for the mre of the topology , then the previous examples indicate that the mre is going to be minimal when the modules under consideration are compositions of only one loop .",
    "in this work we have described an efficient and easy way to to implement the integration technique ibfe , applied to a specific feynman diagram .",
    "the result that has been reached using the concept of modular reduction has two important characteristics : first , in general the diagram multiregion expansion of a given diagram is shorter than if the mre is obtained from the parametric representation of the complete diagram ; second , the modular treatment operationally facilitates obtaining the multiregion expansion . let us discuss this last point , comparing the modular reduction in cases of loop by loop reducible diagrams with @xmath9-@xmath7 insertions in a massless theory which are evaluated using conventional calculation .",
    "the difference is that with ibfe it is possible to do a calculation with the same degree of simplicity , although for more complex bubble type diagrams it is now possible to include masses .",
    "the modular reduction idea leads in general to a minimization of the mre of a diagram , which is more evident when the modules to reduce are composed of one loop .",
    "in fact , the loop by loop reduction optimizes the ibfe application . in more general terms and beyond this work , depending on the one loop topology the minimal mre is reached by a systematic reduction going from the topologically simplest to the more complex : bubbles , triangles , boxes , etc .",
    "the importance of a minimal mre is of course tied to a minimization of the time of finding the solutions , since the mre gets the solutions to the parametric integrals evaluating summations with kronecker deltas in all possible combinations , and now the mre is shorter ( less summations and kronecker deltas , which diminish equally ) , then there are less combinations that need to be taken into account in order to find the solution .",
    "basically what happens is that several combinations which do not lead to relevant terms in the solution are eliminated , and given that with ibfe the integration is replaced by a linear system evaluation , the minimized mre implies smaller linear systems , and therefore simpler to analyze .",
    "the integration technique ibfe is a simple method and at the same time powerful , which can be advantageously compared with other feynman diagram evaluation , and which does not require great mathematical knowledge .",
    "although here we have concentrated in a scalar theory , this method is directly applicable to other theories by previous scalarization of the tensorial loop integrals , which produces a sum of scalar integrals .",
    "in general the most complicated case of an @xmath14 propagator tensorial integral is precisely the corresponding @xmath14 propagator scalar integral .",

    "in the evaluation of @xmath5 loop feynman diagrams , all the possible solutions that can be found are presented in terms of multivariable generalized hypergeometric series .",
    "the actual value of the variables is given in general by ratios of two energy scales associated to the graph igoibfe , including also arguments of value 1. the purpose of this appendix is to provide the necessary information about simple and double hypergeometric functions @xcite , which appear in the solution of the loop integrals , and in particular present their convergence conditions , which are what finally define the different kinematical regions associated to the solution of a specific feynman diagram .",
    "the functions associated to one variable series solutions of a feynman diagram are always expressible in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions , in particular the hypergeometric function of order @xmath305 , which is the only one variable series that is solution to the loop integrals .",
    "thsi function is conventionally denoted as :    @xmath306    where the factors @xmath307 are called pochhammer symbols and which are defined by :    @xmath308    for these functions the convergence conditions are :    * the generalized hypergeometric functions are given by series defined in the convergence region @xmath309 , while for @xmath310 they are defined by analytical continuation . * if @xmath309 the series converges absolutely .",
    "since the variable @xmath311 represents the ratio between two energy scales of the topology , what is obtained is one of the limit representations or solutions , an expansion around @xmath312 . * if @xmath313 , the necessary requirement for the series convergence is that @xmath314 , where @xmath315 is called parametric excess and it is given by the equation :    @xmath316    * for the convergence in @xmath317 it is sufficient that @xmath318 .",
    "the following identities are very useful for building the hypergeometric function starting from the contributions that are obtained of the mre of an arbitrary diagram @xmath13 . aside from formula @xmath319 , sometimes it is useful to use other identities that are needed when there are factors of the type @xmath320 and @xmath321 in the solutions , such as :    @xmath322    @xmath323      here we describe two variable hypergeometric functions , which correspond to the kamp de friet generalized double hypergeometric function @xmath324 and the generalized hypergeometric @xmath325 .",
    "this function is defined as :    @xmath327    where the convergence conditions of the double series exist if the following relation between the indices are satisfied :    @xmath328    @xmath329    and if furthermore , the arguments fulfil the condition :    @xmath330      this series , which appears frequently in the solutions to feynman diagrams , has the following definition :    @xmath332    where the convergence conditions of the double series exist if the following relation between the indices are satisfied :    @xmath328    @xmath333    all the series that have been found with the technique used here fulfil this indexes condition . the determination of the convergence region of the variables can be done using the horns general convergence theory @xcite .",
    "in section @xmath334 we already introduced some algebraic aspects of the ibfe technique , which are generated from the identity associated to the integral parametrization of loops and which is known as schwinger s parametrization :          for simplicity we have eliminated the integral limits , since this identity has only validity in the context of the integrand expansion in @xmath337 .",
    "this expression is crucial for the development of the ibfe method , since in the feynman diagram evaluation the corresponding schwinger parametric representation is a generalized structure of the expression @xmath338 .",
    "notice that explicit use of the kronecker deltas has been made , in order to simplify the parenthesis @xmath56 , and since this happens in the context of expansions , the kronecker deltas remain to indicate the constraints between the indices @xmath341 and @xmath342 .          where the quantities @xmath360,@xmath361 and @xmath362 can take arbitrary values . in this case there are two possible regions or limits for the expansion : the region where @xmath363 and the region where @xmath364 .",
    "these expansions are respectively :                we have obtained in this manner expansions in the two possible limits separately .",
    "it is possible , however , to express both results employing a single series which contains simultaneously both regions . in this sense",
    "we can say that this type of expansion corresponds to a multiregion series representation of the binomial . to show this ,",
    "let us express the binomial @xmath370 using the integral representation of the denominator indicated in @xmath345 .",
    "then we get :              where according to property @xmath346 we can express the parenthesis @xmath56 in three different ways . in any of them",
    "we will have the same kronecker delta which eliminates one of the two sums .",
    "let us see :      on the other hand , the number of possible ways of summing @xmath375 using the kronecker delta can be found in general by evaluating the combinatorial @xmath376 , which in this case is @xmath377 .",
    "let us see what happens when we sum with respect to one particular index :                                the fundamental idea that has been exposed in the previous demonstration is that using the definition @xmath339 it is possible to make a binomial expansion which differs from the conventional on the sense that the expansion is now around zero and infinity simultaneously .",
    "this can be generalized for multinomials and obtain its mre :      the number of different expressions that can be extracted starting from equation @xmath389 is given by all the possible forms of evaluating some of the sums , using for this purpose the kronecker delta generated by the same expansion , that is @xmath390 possible forms .",
    "generalizing even more , any function expressed of a multiregion series employing @xmath4 sums and @xmath91 kronecker deltas , has at most :        all the resulting series are series representations with respect to the ratios between the terms of the multinomial and all of them correspond to multivariable generalizations of the hypergeometric function .    99 a. grozin , _ lectures on qed and qcd , practical calculation and renormalization of one- and multi - loop feynman diagrams , _ world scientific publishing co. pte . ltd . ,",
