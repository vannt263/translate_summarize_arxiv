    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is a recent hybrid medical imaging modality that combines the high resolution of acoustic waves with the large contrast of optical waves . when a body is exposed to short pulse radiation , typically emitted in the near infra - red region in pat ,",
    "it absorbs energy and expands thermo - elastically by a very small amount ; this is the photoacoustic effect .",
    "such an expansion is sufficient to emit acoustic pulses , which travel back to the boundary of the domain of interest where they are measured .",
    "a first step in pat is therefore to reconstruct the amount of deposited energy from time - dependent boundary measurement of acoustic signals .",
    "acoustic signals propagate in fairly homogeneous domains as the sound speed varies very little from one tissue to the next .",
    "the reconstruction of the amount of deposited energy is therefore quite accurate in many practical settings . for references on the practical and theoretical aspects of pat ,",
    "we refer the reader to e.g. @xcite .",
    "once the amount of deposited energy has been reconstructed , a second step consists of inferring the optical properties in the body .",
    "although this second step is less studied mathematically , it has received significant attention in the biomedical literature ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the optical parameters is very useful in practice because the attenuation properties of healthy and unhealthy tissues are extremely different @xcite .",
    "the combination of high spatial resolution of the acoustic signals and large contrast of the optical parameters allows us e.g. to image blood vessels at high resolution , which is in turn important for assessing the status of cancerous tissues .",
    "near infra - red light is best modeled by radiative transfer equations .",
    "what we can reconstruct on the optical coefficients , seen as constitutive parameters in the radiative transfer equation , from measurements of heat deposition for all possible illuminations of the domain has recently been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the latter paper considers the continuous - illumination setting . in other words ,",
    "heat deposition is measured for all possible incoming radiation condition , which can be controlled at the boundary of the domain .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the diffusion approximation to radiative transfer , which is accurate for radiation propagation in highly scattering media .",
    "such an approximation is typically valid for propagations of radiation over one centimeter or more @xcite .",
    "in such a simplified setting , the unknown optical parameters are the spatially varying diffusion and attenuation coefficients .",
    "provided that the diffusion coefficient is known at the domain s boundary , we show that these two coefficients are uniquely determined by two well - chosen illuminations at the boundary of the domain .",
    "an explicit reconstruction procedure is presented , which involves solving a first - order equation with a vector field explicitly constructed from the internal data ( the amount of deposited energy ) .",
    "the stability of the reconstruction of the optical coefficients from two internal data is established under geometric conditions of strict convexity on the domain of interest . in the presence of @xmath0",
    "well - chosen boundary conditions , where @xmath1 is spatial dimension , such geometric constraints can be removed and constructions are possible on essentially arbitrary domains of interest with well - defined boundary .",
    "mathematically , the inverse problem is an inverse diffusion problem with two internal measurements . by using the standard liouville change of variables , the diffusion equation is replaced by a schrdinger equation with unknown potential and with internal measurements involving a second unknown function . by adapting the theory of complex geometrical optics solutions to this setting , we are able to obtain uniqueness and stability results for the inverse schrdinger problem . by means of the inverse liouville change of variables ,",
    "we are able to conclude on the uniqueness and stability of the reconstruction of the optical parameters for the photoacoustic tomography problem in the diffusive regime .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : main ] presents the photoacoustic tomography problem and the main results we obtain in this paper .",
    "the inverse schrdinger problem and the explicit reconstruction algorithms are addressed in section [ sec : sch ] .",
    "how the latter results are used to solve the inverse diffusion problem is explained in section [ sec : idid ] .",
    "the propagation of radiation in scattering media is modeled by the following diffusion equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an open , bounded , connected domain in @xmath4 with @xmath5 boundary @xmath6 ( embedded in @xmath4 ) , where @xmath1 spatial dimension ; @xmath7 is light speed in tissues ; @xmath8 is a ( scalar ) diffusion coefficient ; and @xmath9 is an attenuation coefficient . the source of incoming radiation is prescribed by @xmath10 on the boundary @xmath6 and is assumed to be a very short pulse supported on an interval of time @xmath11 with @xmath12 of order @xmath13 .",
    "the amount of energy deposited is proportional to attenuation and is given by @xmath14 a thermal expansion ( assumed to be proportional to @xmath15 ) results and emits acoustic waves .",
    "such waves are modeled by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the sound speed and @xmath18 a coupling coefficient assumed to be constant and known . the pressure ( potential ) @xmath19",
    "is then measured on @xmath6 as a function of time .",
    "using as in @xcite the difference of time scales @xmath20 , which shows that radiation propagation occurs at a much faster time scale than acoustic wave propagation , we can show that @xmath21 we now have a well - posed inverse wave problem , where measurement of @xmath22dimensional information @xmath19 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 allows us to reconstruct the @xmath22dimensional spatial map @xmath25 .",
    "we assume this step , which has been analyzed in great detail in the literature , completed ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "denoting by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we thus observe that the photoacoustic problem in the diffusive regime amounts to reconstructing @xmath28 from knowledge of @xmath29 for @xmath30 illumination maps @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the solution to the steady - state equation @xmath33 the set of internal data is given by : @xmath34    the main problem of interest in this paper is the uniqueness and the stability of the reconstruction for the inverse diffusion problem with internal data :    * isid : * reconstruction of @xmath28 from knowledge of @xmath35 on @xmath3 for a _",

    "the above result shows uniqueness of the reconstruction of the optical coefficients but does not imply stability . without additional geometric information about @xmath6 , the above procedure may yield unstable reconstructions .",
    "however , provided that @xmath0 well - chosen measurements @xmath77 for @xmath78 are available , then @xmath1 vector fields similar to @xmath18 above may be constructed in order to form locally a basis of vectors in @xmath4 .",
