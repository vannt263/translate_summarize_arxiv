    "a method was found by which string theory excises the singular part of the solution in a way that was consistent with the gauge theory physics .",
    "this is called the `` enhanc con mechanism '' , and simply put , the idea is that the constituent branes making up the supergravity / string solution have expanded to form a spherical shell ( called the `` enhanon '' ) around the region which appears singular in supergravity .",

    "the point is that , just like in the case of ref.@xcite , the dual physics is not just that of supergravity , but of the full type  iib string theory , and the idea here is to try to uncover some of the essential details of the crossover between the two .",
    "the ten dimensional solutions are generically singular in the ir , having naked curvature singularities , while being smooth in the uv , where they are weakly curved , matching onto ads@xmath9 , which is dual to the @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath2 yang  mills theory at large @xmath13 .",

    "the result has the complementary interpretation as the effective geometry seen by the d3brane probe as it moves in ten dimensional spacetime , and as the physics of the moduli space of the gauge theory on the constituent branes .",
    "we find that there _ is _ an enhanon shell , just as in the prototype cases studied in ref.@xcite , which in this case is a ring . here",
    ", there is no enhanced gauge symmetry in the parent supergravity , ( which was partly responsible for the name `` enhanc con '' ) , but all of the other key phenomena are present . in summary :    * there is a ring where the tension of the probe brane drops to zero , signalling the last radius where there is any meaning to the constituent branes as localised sources .",
    "the branes have spread out into a ring there and the supergravity solution interior to that which is singular should be drastically modified by smoothing .",
    "* the full result for the spacetime metric as seen by the probe interpolates smoothly between the simple behaviour at infinity and that of the interior . in gauge theory language",

    "let us use the same radial variable @xmath126 as we did before , initially , although we will define another shortly .",

    "the truly remarkable thing is that it is easy to see that the function @xmath147 has a zero on the circle @xmath148 , which deserves to be called the `` enhanon '' , since@xcite the probe s tension is going to zero there !

    "it fact , this nearly conformal behaviour dominates much of the flow , which is interesting .",
    "more engaging behaviour can be seen in the neighbourhood of @xmath148 , where we may expand the function to see that in that region ( we fix @xmath150 by examining the uv asymptotics and also equation ( [ simplify ] ) ) : @xmath151 which is the one  loop logarithmic running we expect from the gauge coupling of a @xmath92 low energy theory on the coulomb branch of the @xmath78 gauge theory !",

    "however , we are confident that our parameters are correct for the following reasons : on general grounds@xcite , the complete decoupling from gauge theory of the dual supergravity ensures that it must depend on @xmath100 and @xmath13 _ only _ through the thooft coupling @xmath153 .",
    "so our choice for @xmath136 is not unnatural , up to pure numbers .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the ads / cft correspondence is such that we should get the one  loop field theory result in this way , which fixes the factor of @xmath100 , and then the @xmath13 _ must _ accompany it to make @xmath41 .",

    "in fact , ( for the moduli space choice @xmath178 ) , equations ( [ axidill ] ) and ( [ relations ] ) yield : @xmath179 furthermore , taking the limit appropriate to @xmath59 , ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath180 and @xmath181 ) , we see that because of the large power of @xmath164 present in equation ( [ tense ] ) , _ all _ of the types of strings / dyons are tensionless on the enhanon , since nothing can save @xmath182 from going to zero as @xmath183 .",
    "this is generalisation of the features in ref.@xcite which is consistent with the fact that constituent d3branes of the supergravity solution have spread out to form this ring , and so all strings stretched between our probe and the background d3branes will give zero mass states in the limit .",
    "a tantalising feature of the special family of vacua represented by the enhanon is that the dilaton and r  r scalar change as one goes around the circle in @xmath159 , moving along the enhanon ring : the @xmath14``flavour '' of the vacuum changes !",
    "since the overall factor not involving @xmath184 is common to all , it seems intuitively clear that there is a `` lightest '' dyon state among those which go massless , which characterises the vacuum at a given value of  @xmath159 .",
    "this is easy to see by plotting some samples of the behaviour of @xmath185 for a value of @xmath139 away from the enhanon , as we have done in figure  [ wavy ] .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the duality which descends from the @xmath3 of the type  iib string plays a beautiful role here , by exchanging the different vacua at different points on the circle .",
    "for example , the points @xmath186 , forming the principal points on the compass , are special in that @xmath187 .",
    "so a @xmath14 dyon s mass is controlled by the familiar pythagorean form : @xmath188 .",
    "however , as we go around the four points , the dilaton toggles between @xmath32 and @xmath189 .",
    "these are clearly vacua which are related by the action of the @xmath99 generator of the @xmath3 .",
    "we should now return to our discussion of the flows .    *",
    "the @xmath190 curves appear to give behaviour which is irretrievably unphysical from both the point of view of the supergravity and the probe .",
    "this conclusion is in line with the previous suggestions of refs.@xcite , but we make a more detailed suggestion : in it natural to suppose that these flows attempt to take us _ behind _ the enhanon ring to get to the limiting ir physics , where the tension of the probe would need to be ( unphysically ) negative in order to preserve supersymmetry .",
    "we propose , in the spirit of ref.@xcite , that these are not physical solutions for that region .",
    "excising that part of the supergravity solution and ( perhaps ) replacing it with flat space seems prudent .",
    "whether or not this gives a description of a part of gauge theory moduli space possibly hidden inside the enhanon is a matter for future work .",
    "we note again that we also have a full strong / weak coupling duality group acting on the low energy gauge theory .",
    "( it is inherited from the @xmath3 symmetry of the d3brane within type  iib string theory , as discussed in section [ gaugetheory ] ) .",
    "this means that although the gauge coupling diverges on the probe at the enhanon , there is a dual description to a low energy theory with coupling @xmath191 and complex modulus field @xmath192 .",
    "this duality may be interesting to study , although the dual vacua reached thus will also have a full tower of massless dyons , and may require altogether new techniques to study them , since some non  locality certainly arises .",
    "nevertheless , this might be a promising new handle on the issue@xcite of finding an effective low  energy description of the physics near the enhanon , and may also shed light on whether one can make sense of the stringy physics behind it in terms of gauge theory .",
    "we have been informed@xcite that alex buchel , amanda peet , and joe polchinski have done independent work on the issue of probing the solution of ref.@xcite , and understanding the role of the enhanon in this context@xcite .",
