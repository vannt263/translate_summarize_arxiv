    "the fair project at the gsi laboratory has an extensive program aiming at a high - accuracy spectroscopy of charmed hadrons and at an investigation of their interactions with ordinary matter @xcite . for the feasibility of such studies , specifically those of the @xmath12anda experiment @xcite the production rate for charmed hadrons in antiproton - proton ( @xmath13 ) is a key factor .",
    "knowledge of such production rate is also relevant for studies of in - medium changes of charmed hadronsfor recent references , see refs .",
    ". however , presently very little is known about the strength of the interaction of charmed hadrons with ordinary baryons and mesons . in view of that , over the last few years we have looked at the exclusive charm - production reactions @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite close to their thresholds with the objective to provide with our predictions estimations for the pertinent cross sections .    in the present paper",
    "we extend our study of the reaction @xmath14 @xcite to the production of other charmed baryons such as the @xmath16 , the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 .",
    "the projected antiproton beam - momentum available for the @xmath12anda experiment reaches up to @xmath19 gev / c corresponding to a center - of - mass energy of @xmath20 gev @xcite .",
    "thus , the production of most of the charmed members of the lowest su(4 ) @xmath21 baryon @xmath22-plet is possible at @xmath12anda , including the @xmath17 and @xmath18 and even the @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "while there is a large number of calculations for @xmath14 @xcite this can not be said for the production of other charmed baryons .",
    "khodjamirian et al .",
    "@xcite published cross sections for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "titov and kmpfer provided results for @xmath26 , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xcite and for @xmath27 in @xcite . however , their analysis focusses on the region of small momentum transfer and integrated cross sections are not given .",
    "the earliest study we are aware of where integrated cross sections for @xmath28 were presented is the one by kroll et al .",
    "our analysis of charm production is done in complete analogy to that of the reactions @xmath29 performed by the jlich group some time ago @xcite . in those studies",
    "the hyperon - production reaction is considered within a coupled - channel model .",
    "this allows to take into account rigorously the effects of the initial ( @xmath13 ) and final ( @xmath30 ) state interactions which play an important role for energies near the production threshold @xcite .",
    "the microscopic strangeness production is described by meson exchange and arises from the exchange of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons .",
    "the elastic parts of the interactions in the initial ( @xmath13 ) and final ( @xmath30 ) states are likewise described by meson exchange , while annihilation processes are accounted for by phenomenological optical potentials .",
    "specifically , the elastic parts of the initial- ( isi ) and final - state interactions ( fsi ) are @xmath33-parity transforms of an one - boson - exchange variant of the bonn @xmath34 potential  @xcite and of the hyperon - nucleon model  a of ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively . with this model a good overall description of the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 data obtained in the p185 experiment at lear ( cern ) @xcite could be achieved and its results are also in line with the scarce experimental information for @xmath38 @xcite .    the extension of the model to the charm sector is based on su(4 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "accordingly , the elementary charm production process is described by @xmath39-channel @xmath10 and @xmath11 meson exchanges . note that the symmetry is invoked primarily as guideline for providing constraints on the pertinent baryon - meson coupling constants . though we do not expect that the su(4 ) symmetry should hold",
    ", recent calculations of the relevant coupling constants within qcd light - cone sum rules suggest that the actual deviation from the su(4 ) values could be only in the order of a factor @xmath40 or even less @xcite ; even smaller deviations have been obtained  @xcite in a constituent quark model calculation using the @xmath41 pair - creation mechanism .",
    "we examine the sensitivity of the results to variations in the elastic and annihilation parts of the initial @xmath13 interaction . furthermore ,",
    "as already done for @xmath42 @xcite , we investigate the effect of replacing the meson - exchange transition by a charm - production potential derived in a quark model .",
    "again this serves for assessing uncertainties in the model , since one could question the validity of a meson - exchange description of the transition in view of the large masses of the exchanged mesons . in this context",
    "we want to note that meson - exchange as well as the quark model lead to rather short ranged transition potentials .",
    "thus , practically speaking those can be viewed as being contact interactions where the pertinent coupling constants are simply saturated @xcite by the dynamics underlying the two considered approaches .    in the next two sections we introduce the basic ingredients of the model . in section  [ sec",
    ": res ] we present numerical results for total cross sections for the various @xmath43 channels , utilizing for the charm - production mechanism meson - exchange as well as the quark model .",
    "a summary of our work is presented in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "details on the transition potential in the quark model and on the su(4 ) coupling constants that enter the meson - exchange transition potential are collected in appendices .",
    "we calculate the charm production reactions @xmath44 in close analogy to the original jlich coupled channel approach  @xcite to strangeness production .",
    "the transition amplitude is obtained from the solution of a multi - channel lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation , @xmath45 which reads explicitly in terms of the channels @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) corresponding to @xmath48 , @xmath42 , @xmath24 , @xmath49 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 , @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the total energy and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) the relative momentum in the initial ( final ) state in the center - of - mass .",

    "the calculations are performed in isospin basis , which is sufficient for an exploratory study . moreover",
    ", the mass splitting between @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is rather small @xcite .",
    "this is different in the strangeness sector where there is a sizable mass difference between the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 which made a calculation in the particle basis mandatory @xcite .",
    "the transition potential from @xmath48 to the @xmath43 channel is given by @xmath39-channel @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchanges , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] ( upper row ) .",

    "the two baryons in the intermediate states can go on - shell and the pertinent contributions are accordingly enhanced @xcite .",
    "the diagonal potentials @xmath77 are given by the sum of an elastic part and an annihilation part . for the @xmath48 channel we use again the set of potentials introduced and described in refs .  @xcite . their elastic part is loosely connected ( via g - parity transform ) to a simple , energy - independent one - boson - exchange @xmath34 potential ( obepf ) .",
    "however , since at the high energies necessary for charm production any @xmath34 potential has to be considered as being purely phenomenological several variants were constructed in order to explore how strongly the results on charm production depend on the choice of the @xmath48 interaction . in two of those variants ( called a and a in @xcite ) only the longest ranged ( and model - independent ) part of the elastic @xmath48 interaction , namely one - pion exchange , was kept .",
    "model b and c include also some short - range contributions , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "all variants are supplemented by a phenomenological spin- , isospin- , and energy - independent optical potential of gaussian form , in order to take into account annihilation , v^|n n|n n_opt(r ) = ( u_0 + i w_0 ) e^- r^2/2r^2_0 .",
    "[ vaa - pp ] the free parameters ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) were determined by a fit to @xmath48 data in the energy region relevant for the reactions @xmath81 and @xmath82 , i.e. for laboratory momenta of @xmath83 gev / c .",
    "( their actual values can be found in table  1 of ref .",
    "the data set comprises total cross sections , and integrated elastic and charge - exchange ( @xmath84 ) cross sections .",
    "with all four variants a rather satisfying description of the @xmath48 data in that energy region could be obtained as documented in refs .",
    "even at @xmath85 gev / c , i.e. at a momentum that corresponds roughly to the @xmath27 threshold , the differential cross section is nicely reproduced by all models , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ pbarp ] .",
    "evidently , not only the magnitude at very forward angles but also the slope is reproduced well by all considered @xmath48 interactions .",
    "we want to emphasize that differential cross sections were not included in the fitting procedure and are , therefore , predictions of the models .",
    "note that yet another @xmath48 model was considered in @xcite , namely model d , which is based on the full g - parity transformed obepf .",
    "however , its results disagree considerably with the empirical @xmath13 differential cross sections as well as with the integrated charge - exchange cross sections and , thus , can not be considered to be realistic . because of that it was no longer utilized in our study of @xmath82 @xcite and we will not use it here either .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the interaction in the final @xmath42 system was assumed to be the same as the one in @xmath86 .",
    "specifically , this means that the elastic part of the interaction is fixed by coupling constants and vertex form factors taken from the hyperon - nucleon model  a of ref .",
    "@xcite , while the annihilation part is again parameterized by an optical potential which contains , however , spin - orbit and tensor components in addition to a central component @xcite : v^|_c^- _ c^+|_c^- _ c^+_opt(r ) & = & e^- r^2/2r^2_0 .",
    "[ vaa - ll ] the free parameters in the optical @xmath86 potential were determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by a fit to data on total and differential cross sections , and analyzing power for @xmath35 .",
    "as already emphasized in @xcite , we do not expect that the @xmath42 interaction will be the same on a quantitative level .",
    "but at least the bulk properties should be similar , because in both cases near threshold the interactions will be govered by strong annihilation processes . in the present study",
    "we need also interactions in the final @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 systems .",
    "those interactions have been fixed by adopting the same philosophy as for @xmath42 and the parameters are likewise taken over from corresponding studies in the strangeness sector @xcite .",
    "as an alternative to meson exchange we consider a charm - production potential inspired by quark - gluon dynamics . the strange - hadron production in @xmath87 reactions has been studied extensively within the constituent quark model in the past .",
    "the best known works are perhaps those of kohno and weise  @xcite , furui and faessler  @xcite , burkardt and dillig  @xcite , roberts  @xcite and alberg , henley and wilets  @xcite . for an extensive list of references",
    "see the review @xcite and for a fairly recent work ref .  @xcite . in the present study",
    "we adopt the interaction proposed by kohno and weise , derived in the so - called @xmath88 mechanism . in this model the @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 )",

    "@xcite and to our initial study @xcite now we take into account the quark - mass dependence of the intrinsic wave functions of the baryons .",
    "this dependence is encoded in the functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 for which explicit expressions can be found in appendix  [ app : qm ] , together with the transition potentials to other channels such as @xmath100 . for equal quark masses @xmath101 and @xmath102 reduce to @xmath103 so that one recovers the result of kohno and weise . however , considering the difference in the constituent quark masses of the strange and the charmed quark one arrives at somewhat different strengths and ranges for the transition potentials in the strangeness and charm sectors .",
    "choosing @xmath104 fm and @xmath105 @xmath106 ensures agreement with the parameters used in our studies of @xmath35 @xcite and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the effective coupling strength depends explicitly on the effective gluon propagator @xmath108 , i.e. on the square of the energy transfer from initial to final quark pair , cf .",
    "heuristically this energy transfer corresponds roughly to the masses of the produced constituent quarks , i.e. @xmath109 so that we expect the effective coupling strength @xmath95 for charm production to be reduced by the ratio of the constituent quark masses of the strange and the charmed quark squared , @xmath110 ( 550 mev / 1600 mev)@xmath111 @xmath112 1/9 as compared to the one for @xmath35 .",

    "before we present our results for charm production let us discuss briefly the reaction @xmath37 . when the jlich group published their results back in 1993 @xcite the only experimental information on the @xmath116 channel at low energies consisted in a preliminary data point for @xmath117 . in the meantime",
    "the final result for @xmath117 has become available @xcite and also a measurement for @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the latter channel is of particular interest because it requires a double charge - exchange and , therefore , at least a two - step process . in our model calculation",
