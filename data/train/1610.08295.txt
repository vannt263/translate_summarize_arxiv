    "the perona - malik _ anisotropic diffusion _ technique in image processing @xcite is formally based on a gradient - flow dynamics related to the non - convex energy @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the output signal or picture defined on @xmath3 and @xmath4 a tuning parameter . in the convexity domain of the energy function ; i.e. , if @xmath5 the effect of the gradient flow is supposed to smoothen the initial data , while on discontinuity sets where @xmath6 the gradient of the energy is formally zero and no motion is expected . in reality , such a gradient flow is ill - posed and even in dimension one we may have strong solutions only for some certain classes of initial data , or weak solutions which develop complex microstructure . however , the anisotropic diffusion technique is always applied in a discrete or semi - discrete context , where energy @xmath7 is only a ( formal ) continuum approximation of some discrete energy defined on some space of finite elements or in a finite - difference context .",
    "indeed , it is well known that convex - concave energies , which give ill - posed problems if simply extended from a discrete to a continuum context , are related to well - posed problems in a properly defined passage discrete - to - continuum . in a static framework ,",
    "the prototype of this argument dates back to the analysis of chambolle @xcite , who showed that the blake - zisserman weak - membrane discrete energy ( involving truncated quadratic potentials ) @xcite can be approximated by the mumford - shah functional @xcite .",
    "the latter functional ( together with its anisotropic variants ) is a common continuum approximation of a class of lattice energies with convex - concave energy functions , which also comprises atomistic energies such as lennard - jones ones @xcite and the discretized version of the perona - malik functional itself as showed by morini and negri @xcite ( see also @xcite section 11.5 ) .",
    "the approximation of these lattice energies is performed by considering the lattice spacing @xmath8 as a small parameter and suitably scaling the energies . in the case of the perona - malik discretized energy on the cubic lattice @xmath9 the scaled functionals",
    "latexmath:[\\[f_{\\varepsilon}(u):=\\sum_{i , j } \\frac{\\e^{n-1}}{|\\log \\varepsilon | } \\log\\left(1+|\\log \\varepsilon |\\frac {    of @xmath2 at @xmath11 and the sum is performed on nearest neighbours ) @xmath0-converge to a mumford - shah energy , with an anisotropic surface energy density in dimension larger than one @xcite .",
    "this means that the solutions to global minimization problems involving @xmath12 , identified with their piecewise - constant interpolations , converge as @xmath8 tends to zero to the solutions to the corresponding global minimization problems involving the mumford - shah functional .",
    "examples of such global minimum problems comprise problems in image processing with an additional lower - order fidelity term ( typically an @xmath13-distance of @xmath2 from the input datum @xmath14 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze how much this approximation procedure can be extended beyond the global - minimization standpoint by examining the one - dimensional case .",
    "it is known that @xmath0-convergence can not be easily extended as a theory to the analysis of the behaviour of local minima or to a dynamical setting beyond , essentially , the `` trivial '' case of convex energies @xcite . however ,",
    "several recent examples suggest that for problems with concentration some quasistatic and dynamic models are compatible with @xmath0-convergence ( such as for ginzburg - landau @xcite or for lennard - jones @xcite energies ) . we show that this holds also for one - dimensional quasistatic and dynamic problems obtained as minimizing movements along the family @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "they coincide with the corresponding problems related to the one - dimensional mumford - shah functional @xmath15 defined on piecewise @xmath16-function , where @xmath17 is the set of discontinuity points of @xmath2 .",
    "we note the difficulty of the extension to dimension larger or equal than two , for which a characterization of minimizing movements for the mumford - shah functional is still lacking @xcite .    in the quasistatic case ,",
    "our analysis relies on a modeling assumption , that amounts to considering as dissipated the energy beyond the convexity threshold .",
    "again , we show that the mumford - shah energy is an approximation of @xmath12 also in that framework . for an analysis of the quasistatic case in dimension",
    "larger than one within its application to fracture mechanics we refer to @xcite .    when local minimization is taken into account",
    ", then we show that indeed for some classes of problems the pattern of local minima of @xmath12 differ from that of @xmath18 .",
    "the computation of the @xmath0-limit can nevertheless be used as a starting point for the construction of `` equivalent theories '' , which keep the simplified form of the @xmath0-limit but maintain the pattern of local minima .",
    "this process has been formalized in @xcite . in our case",
    "we prove the @xmath0-equivalence of energies of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 a concave function with @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 large .",
    "another case in which the mumford - shah functional is not a good approximation of the scaled perona - malik is for the long - time behaviour of gradient - flow dynamics , as we briefly illustrate in the final section .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional system of @xmath24 sites with nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the _ spacing parameter _ and let @xmath26 be a function defined on the lattice @xmath27 $ ] . if taking @xmath8 as parameter , we also denote @xmath28 .",
    "we define the _ scaled one - dimensional perona - malik _ functional as latexmath:[\\ ] ] rewriting these terms we obtain @xmath467 observe that this estimate still holds for @xmath468 or @xmath469 .",
    "in fact , in that case we have @xmath470 consider now the function @xmath471 so that reads @xmath472 the key point is the following lemma ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath473 be a lipschitz function with lipschitz constant @xmath474 .",
    "let @xmath475 be a sequence of real numbers and @xmath476 such that @xmath477 then , if @xmath478 , it holds @xmath479 for all @xmath480 .",
    "let @xmath485 be a minimizing movement for the scaled perona - malik functional , then for every @xmath335 each jump point of @xmath2 is obtained as limit of a sequence of jump points of the extension @xmath486 as defined in theorem [ thm1 ] ( notice in particular statement @xmath487 ) .",
    "hence , if we define @xmath488 we have @xmath489 for every @xmath335 .",
    "recalling theorem [ equazionefinale ] , we proved that a minimizing movement for functional satisfies the heat equation with neumann boundary conditions on @xmath490 .",
    "this result is the same for the minimizing movement of mumford - shah functional @xcite , so that the following result holds .",
    "let @xmath491 be an initial datum that satisfies and ; let @xmath492 be a minimizing movement for the scaled perona - malik functional @xmath318 as defined in .",
    "then , if @xmath315 and holds , @xmath492 converges in @xmath493 to a minimizing movement of the mumford - shah functional .      in this section",
    "we finally remark that , while we concluded that the perona - malik energies are approximated by the mumford - shah functional as gradient - flow dynamics are concerned , this does not hold for long - time dynamics .",
    "long - time dynamics can be defined by introducing a time - scaling parameter @xmath494 , and applying a recursive minimizing scheme to the scaled energies .",
    "fixed an initial datum @xmath124 we define recursively @xmath495 as a minimizer for the minimum problem @xmath496 equivalently the same minimum problem can be written as @xmath497 so that @xmath495 can be seen as produced by a minimizing movements scheme with time step @xmath498 .",
    "now , if @xmath499 is a discretization over the lattice of time - step @xmath368 , we have @xmath500 this shows that the introduction of the constant parameter @xmath106 is equivalent to a scaling in time .    in order to show that for some time scaling @xmath106 the sequence @xmath12 is not equivalent to @xmath18 we consider an initial datum @xmath14 which is a local minimum for @xmath18 , so that the corresponding motion is trivial at all scales : @xmath501 for all @xmath164 .",
    "we then exhibit some @xmath106 such that the recursive minimization scheme above gives a non - trivial limit evolution .",
    "we may describe the minimizers @xmath507 by a direct computation using the minimality conditions : if @xmath202 is the constant value of @xmath507 on the interval @xmath508 , then @xmath202 solves the equation @xmath509 in order to obtain a non - trivial limit as @xmath510,we may choose the scaling @xmath511 with such a time - scaling , in the limit we get an equation for @xmath512 of the form @xmath513 hence , if the initial datum has the value @xmath514 in the interval @xmath508 , the motion is not trivial .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further examples .",
    "note that the time - scaled minimizing - movement scheme along the functionals @xmath126 in section [ gammaec ] for @xmath106 as in ( [ ltlambda ] ) gives the same limit equation ( [ lteq ] ) for the computation above , provided that also @xmath515 as @xmath516 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath126 may be considered as a finer approximation carrying on the equivalence to long - time behaviours .",
