    "this note has two parts : first , we consider topological properties of smooth orbifolds that describe obstructions to being a _ _ global ( resp .",
    "discrete ) quotient _ _ i.e . equivalent ( in a sense made more precise below ) to an orbifold associated to a finite ( resp .",
    "discrete ) group action on a smooth manifold , and second , we apply our general results on global quotients to toric deligne - mumford stacks . recall that an orbifold structure , considered from the classical viewpoint ( originating in the work of satake @xcite ) , can be described via local charts , each of which are quotients @xmath4 of a linear action of a finite group @xmath5 on an open subset @xmath6 of euclidean space .",
    "the point is that for a general orbifold , these local charts do not necessarily ` patch together ' into a global finite group action on a smooth manifold , but for a global quotient , they do .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the following few points at the outset .",
    "firstly , in this paper , by a ` smooth ( resp .",
    "topological ) orbifold ' we mean a _ smooth ( resp .",
    "topological ) stack _ , or more precisely , a _ stack in the category @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8)_. ( in our exposition we have attempted to make the language of stacks accessible to a non - expert audience ( more on this below ) , although in no way do we aim to be a textbook .",
    "we suggest @xcite for more about stacks from a topologist s point of view ; a complete beginner may wish to start with @xcite or @xcite . ) in particular , the notion of ` equivalence ' in the previous paragraph is a ( weak ) equivalence of the underlying categories of the stacks .",
    "it is important to note that such an equivalence is more restrictive than a homeomorphism of underlying topological spaces ; this is because such a homeomorphism does not retain any ` stacky ' information relating to the orbifold singularities . a basic class of examples illustrating this distinction are the so - called _ weighted projective stacks _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 acts diagonally on @xmath11 with weights @xmath12 .",
    "( here we follow the convention in the literature and denote by @xmath13 $ ] the _ stack _ associated to a @xmath2-action on a space @xmath14 ; the topological quotient ( orbit ) _ space _ is denoted @xmath15 . )",
    "although the underlying orbit space @xmath16 is homeomorphic to the orbit space of a finite group action on complex projective space @xmath17 ( see @xcite for details ) , the stack @xmath18 is not equivalent _ as a stack _ to a global quotient ( except in the trivial case when all of the weights are equal to @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a smooth manifold ) .",
    "this follows from theorem [ thm : tfae ] below , but is also well - known ",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "secondly , we emphasize that we restrict ourselves throughout this paper to orbifolds arising as quotient stacks @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath2 is a lie group acting smoothly and properly on a smooth manifold @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noting that all _ reduced _ , or _",
    "effective _ orbifolds  orbifolds whose local isotropy groups act effectively  are known to be of this type by a frame - bundle construction ( see , for example , @xcite ) , so this is not a very restrictive condition in practice . moreover , as we already mentioned , the main application we have in mind of our theorem  [ thm : tfae ] is to the beautiful class of quotient stacks known as toric deligne - mumford stacks , which are stack analogues of smooth toric varieties .",
    "thirdly , we recall that in his foundational work @xcite , noohi deals with topological stacks and the theory of ( stacky ) fundamental groups and coverings in a very general framework .",
    "we owe much to @xcite for both the mathematical content and the exposition in sections  [ sec : preliminaries ] ,  [ section : pi1 of quotient stacks ] , and  [ section : quotients and covers ] .",
    "indeed , our theorem  [ thm : tfae ] , quoted below , can be viewed as an extension of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 18.24 ) in the special case of quotient stacks . by restricting to quotient stacks , we are able to connect aspects of stacky algebraic topology with a distinctly geometric ( and classical ) condition on a lie group acting on a manifold ; in particular , our proofs are our own . in our exposition",
    "we have attempted to explicitly preserve the classical perspective and language as much as possible ; we hope this serves to illustrate to a broad audience the appeal of the stack perspective , and to further elucidate the insights of @xcite in a setting that is common in differential geometry , namely lie groups acting on manifolds .    with these points in mind we now state our main general result on stacks arising as global quotients ( theorem [ thm : tfae ] in section  [ section : quotients and covers ] ) .",
    "we refer to section [ subsec : fundamental group ] for the definition of the inertia homomorphism in ( [ item : inertia ] ) , and section [ section : quotients and covers ] for a discussion of ( stacky ) covering projections appearing in ( [ item : cover ] ) . for now , the reader may keep in mind that the _ inertia groups _ @xmath21 mentioned below can be identified with isotropy groups @xmath22 of certain points @xmath23 .",
    "thm : tfae let @xmath14 be a simply connected manifold , equipped with a smooth proper action of a lie group @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the connected component of the identity element of @xmath2 , and @xmath21 the inertia group of @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the following statements are equivalent .    1 .",

    "the ( stacky ) universal cover of @xmath13 $ ] is equivalent to a smooth manifold .",
    "[ item : cover ]    though conditions ( [ item : quotient ] ) , ( [ item : inertia ] ) , and ( [ item : cover ] ) are known to be equivalent by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 18.24 ) , we provide a different proof of these equivalencies for the case of quotient stacks by showing each of these conditions is in turn equivalent to ( [ item : acts freely ] ) .",
    "the distinctly geometric appeal of condition ( [ item : acts freely ] ) , in comparison to the topological nature of conditions ( [ item : inertia ] ) and ( [ item : cover ] ) , also carries over in our interpretation of this result in the setting of smooth toric dm stacks .",
    "we now take a moment to briefly recall the context of our discussion of _ toric deligne - mumford ( dm ) stacks _ in section  [ sec : toricdmstacks ] . in their foundational paper @xcite , borisov , chen , and smith",
    "introduce the notion of a _ stacky fan _ , the combinatorial data from which one constructs a toric deligne - mumford ( dm ) stack using an anaolgue of the cox quotient construction in algebraic geometry . in @xcite , an abstract definition of a smooth toric dm stack was given , which was shown to be compatible with the construction of borisov , chen , and smith @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite for related approaches ) . from the symplectic geometry perspective ,",
    "lerman and malkin @xcite gave a definition of symplectic toric dm stacks ( in the smooth category @xmath7 ) , offering a modern perspective on symplectic toric orbifolds .",
    "in fact , parallel to the classical theory of toric varieties , there is a subfamily of toric dm stacks  namely those toric dm stacks whose underlying fan is polytopal  that admit a construction from symplectic geometry via _ stacky polytopes _ , using an adaptation of the construction of borisov , chen , and smith ( see @xcite ) . in particular , from this construction , this subfamily can be seen to give examples of symplectic toric dm stacks .",
    "( in earlier work , lerman and tolman extended the delzant classification of ( compact ) symplectic toric manifolds to symplectic toric orbifolds ; in the orbifold case , the classification is by ` labelled polytopes '  i.e. polytopes with positive integer labels attached to each facet @xcite . ) in this manuscript , we interpret our analysis of orbifolds as global quotients in this class of examples ; our results are explicit and combinatorial , stated in terms of the stacky fan / polytope .    in order to state our main results for smooth toric dm stacks ,",
    "recall that a stacky fan is a triple @xmath28 consisting of a finitely generated @xmath29-module @xmath30 , a simplicial fan @xmath31 in @xmath32 with @xmath33 rays @xmath34 , and a homomorphism @xmath35 satisfying certain conditions ( see definition [ definition : stacky fan ] ) . by interpreting theorem [ thm : tfae ] in this case",
    ", we can characterize global quotients among toric dm stacks in terms of their underlying stacky fans .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the image of @xmath37 , and for a cone @xmath38 in @xmath31 , let @xmath39 denote @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the @xmath42-th standard basis vector in @xmath43 . in this context , condition ( [ item : acts freely ] ) of theorem [ thm : tfae ] results in the following corollary , which characterizes the stacky fans yielding global quotients .",
    "we note that the equivalence of condition ( [ item : acts freely ] ) of theorem [ thm : tfae ] and the combinatorial condition stated in corollary  [ cor : globalquotient ] , in the context of toric dm stacks , was first proved via a different method  a combinatorial analysis of the local isotropy groups  in joint work of the authors with goldin and johanssen ; this approach is described in @xcite .",
    "we also note that in @xcite , the authors study quasi - toric orbifolds using techniques from toric topology , and obtain similar results describing universal covers of quasi - toric orbifolds in that framework .",
    "cor : globalquotient let @xmath28 be a stacky fan , and let @xmath44 denote the corresponding toric dm stack . then @xmath44 is equivalent to a global quotient if and only if @xmath45 for all maximal cones @xmath38 in @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to corollary  [ cor : globalquotient ] , we interpret the other obstructions appearing in conditions ( [ item : inertia ] ) and ( [ item : cover ] ) of theorem [ thm : tfae ] for toric dm stacks in terms of stacky fans .",
    "specifically , using results in @xcite , we see that the inertia homomorphisms of condition ( [ item : inertia ] ) can be identified with very natural homomorphisms defined in terms of the stacky fan ( proposition [ prop : inertia homomorphism for dm stacks ] ) . additionally , we describe the universal cover of a toric dm stack in terms of its stacky fan in proposition [ prop : universal cover of toric stack ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the universal cover of a toric dm stack is given in terms of its stacky fan data , and is hence also a toric dm stack arising from a stacky fan . in particular , global quotients among toric",
    "dm stacks are quotients of toric _ manifolds _ by finite group actions .",
    "we expect such a nice description to be useful in computations of orbifold / stacky invariants , particularly for global quotients ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . after a brief discussion of stacks and fundamental groups of stacks in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we specialize to quotient stacks in section [ section : pi1 of quotient stacks ] , where we describe in detail the fundamental group , and inertia homomorphism of quotient stacks . in section [ section : quotients and covers ] , we describe the universal cover of a quotient stack and prove theorem [ thm : tfae ] stated above ; analogous results for connected but non - simply connected @xmath14 are also explored in this section . in section",
    "[ sec : toricdmstacks ] , we turn our attention to toric dm stacks , where we describe the inertia homomorphism ( section [ subsec : toricinertia ] ) and universal cover ( section [ subsec : toriccover ] ) of toric dm stacks .",
    "we also verify an expected relation between the symplectic volumes ( in the stacky polytope case ) of a symplectic toric dm stack and its universal cover , and the corresponding volumes of the underlying polytopes .",
    "we conclude with some examples in section [ subsec : examples ]",

    "the above definition allows for non - trivial global stabilizer .",
    "an important instance of the above definition is the following .",
