    "<S> light stops can give a strong first order electroweak phase transition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) satisfying one of the necessary conditions for electroweak baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss the region of parameter space where this occurs using a perturbative analysis of the higgs effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> two - loop qcd corrections associated with stop loops are crucial to open this baryogenesis window , which corresponds to @xmath0 , one stop not much heavier than the top quark , @xmath1 and a light higgs boson with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this region will be explored by lep  ii very soon .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    -15.cm    the study of the properties of the electroweak phase transition ( and in particular of its strength ) in the mssm is motivated by the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite ( which can not take place in the minimal standard model ) . </S>",
    "<S> a necessary condition for a successful baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition is that this transition is strong enough to suppress sphaleron reactions in the broken phase , preventing the erasure of the created baryon asymmetry . in this talk , </S>",
    "<S> i address the question of whether this constraining condition can be met in some region of the mssm parameter space ( improving thus over the situation in the sm ) </S>",
    "<S> . the emphasis here will be on the qualitative aspects rather than in the quantitative details , which can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to a great extent , </S>",
    "<S> the prospects for a strong transition depend on the details of the @xmath3 higgs potential . </S>",
    "<S> the mssm higgs sector contains two higgs doublets @xmath4 of opposite hypercharge . </S>",
    "<S> electroweak breaking is described by a higgs potential which is a function of two fields @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . in the broken phase , </S>",
    "<S> the higgs spectrum consists of two neutral scalars @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , one pseudoscalar @xmath9 and a charged higgs pair @xmath10 and , at tree - level , the properties of the higgs sector are determined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 fixed by the gauge boson masses ) .    in the @xmath14 plane , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum of the @xmath3 potential lies along the direction determined by @xmath15 . when @xmath16 , the mass eigenstate @xmath17 ( which always has a mass controlled by the electroweak scale ) is aligned with that breaking direction while the orthogonal @xmath18 direction has mass @xmath19 . in that case , the low - energy potential reduces to a one - dimensional sm - like potential @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the temperature dependent potential as long as @xmath21 . for @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 forms some angle with the breaking direction and the full two higgs potential should be considered . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is not affected qualitatively by radiative corrections which , however , change sizably the quantitative properties of the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect is that the mass along the breaking direction is @xmath23 where the second term comes from top - stop ( with masses @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ) loops . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of @xmath17 satisfies @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependent effective potential can be computed up to two - loops in perturbation theory ( with resummation of important thermal effects ) using standard techniques  @xcite , and the electroweak transition at @xmath27 studied . </S>",
    "<S> to a good approximation , this transition proceeds along a fixed direction @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical analysis shows that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 for small @xmath12 and @xmath31 for large @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition strength , as measured by @xmath32 , is controlled by the quartic higgs coupling along the direction of breaking @xmath33 and @xmath34 is directly proportional to @xmath35 ( given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) with @xmath36 ) which , in general , is not the mass of any physical higgs boson . the condition to avoid the erasure of baryons by sphalerons right after the transition is  @xcite @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now describe how @xmath38 depends on the @xmath39 parameters . at large @xmath12 ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . from the @xmath15 dependence of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) we conclude that @xmath38 is larger for @xmath43 ( which minimizes @xmath44 ) . for small @xmath12 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 and larger values of @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> are probed . in this case , having a light @xmath17 does not help to increase @xmath38 because @xmath17 lies along a direction which is not the breaking direction . we conclude that , for fixed @xmath15 , @xmath38 is smaller for smaller @xmath12 and the region where the transition is stronger is that of large @xmath12 and small @xmath15 . in that region , @xmath17 ( and its potential ) </S>",
    "<S> is sm - like . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , without extra susy contributions to the potential , the sm result @xmath47 for @xmath48 ( lep ii limit  @xcite ) is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the two - doublet structure of the potential , being constrained by supersymmetry , is of no help to strengthen the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the important susy effects that can change this situation are those of the stops , which , being bosons , with a large number of degrees of freedom and a large coupling ( @xmath49 ) to the higgs fields can affect @xmath38 sizably through contributions of infrared origin to the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the field - dependent masses of the stops are of the form ( neglecting @xmath50 mixing which tends to weaken the transition and @xmath51 terms for simplicity ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for @xmath55 respectively ) are soft - susy breaking masses and @xmath56 is a thermal contribution to the effective stop masses from interactions with the surrounding plasma . in the absence of @xmath57 and @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> , static stop modes contribute to the 1-loop potential  @xcite a term @xmath59 which enhances @xmath38 significantly . at two - loops  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the same modes , in a @xmath60 setting - sun diagram , contribute @xmath61 with a similar enhancement effect on @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> non - zero @xmath57 and @xmath58 screen this ideal behaviour reducing the effect , so that the transition is stronger for smaller @xmath62 and @xmath63 . a lower limit on @xmath62 can be obtained requiring that the contribution of the @xmath64 doublet to the @xmath65 parameter stays within experimental limits . </S>",
    "<S> there is no such constraint on @xmath63 so that we set it to zero . </S>",
    "<S> negative values of @xmath63 are associated with the existence of a dangerous color breaking minimum of the full scalar potential along the stop direction . </S>",
    "<S> modest negative values of @xmath63 are however still allowed cosmologically and can further increase @xmath38 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite loops of stop static modes have no infrared problems because @xmath57 and @xmath58 cut - off infrared divergences . however , they can reapear if @xmath66 , casting some doubt on the reliability of the perturbative analysis of the @xmath67 region . to be on the safe side </S>",
    "<S> i restrict my discussion to the @xmath68 region . </S>",
    "<S> for analyses of the @xmath67 region , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite@xmath69@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 contains the results for @xmath38 from an analysis  @xcite of the effective potential up to two - loops in resummed perturbation theory with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and zero stop mixing . </S>",
    "<S> it shows how @xmath38 can be larger than 1 for low values of @xmath15 ( solid lines ) and large enough @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> very low @xmath15 corresponds to a light @xmath17 ( lines of constant @xmath44 are dashed ) , which is experimentally excluded . imposing the lep limit ( @xmath73 ) we find a window for baryogenesis which has @xmath74 , @xmath1 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one of the stops should be not much heavier than @xmath76 ( values slightly bigger are still allowed ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of this with 1-loop results  @xcite shows the importance of the two - loop corrections to achieve @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the large size of two - loop contributions is not a symptom of the breaking of the perturbative expansion because qcd corrections appear first at that order . </S>",
    "<S> similar 2-loop corrections were present in the sm for top loops , but there no enhancement of @xmath38 was present due to the fermionic nature of the top quark ( @xmath78 in that case ) .    in the sm , </S>",
    "<S> the resummed perturbative analysis of the electroweak phase transition along the same lines is not reliable for values of the higgs mass larger than @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> one can estimate the loop expansion parameter ( e.g. in the vicinity of the broken minimum ) as @xmath80 ( in the sm , the transition is driven by gauge boson loops . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 is the cost of an extra @xmath82 loop ) . </S>",
    "<S> to have @xmath83 requires @xmath84 . in the mssm , </S>",
    "<S> when stops drive the transition , the cost of an extra stop loop is @xmath85 and we see that our analysis is expected to be reliable for larger values of @xmath44 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the window found for baryogenesis falls within the region where our loop expansion is under control .    </S>",
    "<S> interesting alternative approaches  @xcite to the study of the mssm electroweak phase transition have been followed using 3d reduced effective theories plus lattice simulations ( see talks by m. laine and j. cline ) with qualitatively similar results </S>",
    "<S> . however , these analyses are less reliable precisely in the small @xmath63 region , which is the interesting one for baryogenesis </S>",
    "<S> . clearly , more work along these lines would be desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , if stops are close to the fermi scale ( as originally motivated by supersymmetry ) they drive the electroweak phase transition and can give @xmath77 as a necessary ingredient for electroweak baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> qcd radiative effects are crucial to this point . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the available parameter space is very constrained . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the condition @xmath75 will be challenged by lep  ii very soon . </S>",
    "<S> let us hope susy gets lucky once more . </S>"
