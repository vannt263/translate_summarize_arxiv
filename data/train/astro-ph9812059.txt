    "it is not possible to construct a reliable grb redshift distribution from the statistics of eight grbs . except for grb 980425 , however , whose nature remains controversial , the obtained redshifts place most grbs at the cosmological epoch of active star formation .",
    "several models for the origin of grbs , such as the collapsar / hypernova scenario ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ) or the supranova scenario of vietri & stella ( 1998 ) , suggest that grbs are physically related to recent star formation .",
    "their cosmological distribution should therefore trace the star formation history of the universe ( @xcite ) .",

    "grbs with @xmath166 are preferentially detected for the value of @xmath153  @xmath128 chosen here , and the contribution of dirtier fireballs to the peak flux , @xmath1 , and @xmath29 distribution is almost negligible .",

    "the figure confirms that the actual shape of the distribution of baryon loading factors is only weakly constrained : a large range of @xmath115 values ( @xmath169 ) yields acceptable fits to all three distributions .",
    "in contrast , the power - law in @xmath136 is constrained to a narrow range of indices , @xmath170 .",
    "the normalization of our model peak flux distribution requires @xmath171 , which yields a local grb rate @xmath172  grbs  yr@xmath28  gpc@xmath173 . assuming a local galaxy number density of @xmath174  mpc@xmath173 ( @xcite ) , this is equivalent to a local grb rate of 92 galactic events per myr .",
    "this rate is a factor of 3700 higher than the result of wijers et al .",
    "however , we note that the population assumed here contains many undetected bursts for the existence of which , consequently , there is no evidence .",
    "the faintest detectable bursts in our model distributions are located beyond a redshift of @xmath175 .",
    "the maximum of the redshift distribution is located around @xmath176 , in good agreement with the redshifts from grbs measured so far .",
    "the small number of these grbs does not yet allow an independent statistical analysis .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fits ] that the bimodality of the burst duration can not be explained with the continuous burst source population assumed in our model calculations .",
    "the @xmath29 bimodality is not an instrumental effect , but indicates that grbs consist of at least 2 separate classes , characterized by different physical parameters .",
    "the peak flux distribution of meegan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was constructed on the basis of the 1024  ms trigger criterion , which misses most of the short bursts .",
    "furthermore , all grbs for which redshifts could be measured as a consequence of their precise localization by the bepposax satellite , belong to the subclass of long bursts .",
    "thus , there is very limited information on the short bursts so far .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to model this subclass of grbs in this paper . with new data expected from the upcoming hete  ii mission , which might enable us to localize also several short bursts and determine their broadband spectral characteristics and redshifts ,",
    "a global statistical analysis similar to the one presented here might become possible .",
    "the external shock model qualitatively explains the trend ( tavani 1998 ) that grbs with harder spectra have , on average , smaller @xmath177 values .",
    "consider the simplification where fireballs are characterized only by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "blast waves with larger values of @xmath31 decelerate and radiate more rapidly and emit the bulk of their radiation at shorter wavelengths .",
    "they are therefore more luminous ( see fig .  [ zmax ] ) , shorter and harder .",
    "more energetic grbs have longer durations ( eq . [ [ td ] ] ) .",
    "tavani s long / hard class of grbs therefore corresponds to the class of fireballs with the largest values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and these are the ones that can be detected from the greatest distances and therefore exhibit the strongest non - euclidean effects . by contrast , the long / soft class of grbs represents less luminous fireballs with smaller mean values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . only being detectable from relatively nearby sites , these would display smaller cosmological effects on the peak flux distribution .",
    "analogous reasoning would also apply to the short class of grbs , though the bimodality of this population indicates that other parameters must also be taken into account .",
    "we note that the external synchrotron shock model , as parametrized by eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) , specifically applies to the so - called  fast - rise , exponential decay \" fred - like burst light curves ( see fishman & meegan 1995 ; @xcite ) . while the overall spectral shape and luminosity ( which determines the peak flux and @xmath1 distributions ) may be similar for more complicated , spiky light curves",
    " which could arise from the interaction of the blast wave with an inhomogeneous medium ( @xcite )  the observed durations might be altered by this effect .",
    "however , the bimodality of the duration distribution is not reasonably explained by a variety of light curves , and probably indicates a bimodality in parameter space ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the cosmological blast wave model to fit simultaneously the peak flux , @xmath1 , and @xmath29 distributions as observed by batse , using an analytical representation of the spectral evolution predicted by the external shock model .",
    "the grb source distribution is assumed to trace the star formation history of the universe .",
    "for our standard cosmology ( @xmath102  km  s@xmath178  mpc@xmath28 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) , the peak flux and @xmath1 distributions , and the @xmath29 distribution of the population of grbs with durations @xmath181  s can be modeled with a source population characterized by @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , if the density of the circumburster material is assumed as @xmath186  @xmath128 .",
    "equally good fits can be found for different values of the cbm density , if the product @xmath126 is held constant .",
    "our results are fairly sensitive to the radiative regime of the blast wave and to the value of the equipartition parameter .",
    "the widths of the observed statistical distributions can not be explained solely by cosmological redshift and time dilation effects , but require a broad distribution of intrinsic parameters , in particular of the total blastwave energy @xmath136 and the initial bulk lorentz factor @xmath31 . assuming that these parameters are distributed according to single power - laws , the @xmath136 distribution is well constrained for a fixed set of parameters which gives a good fit to the distributions , while the modeling results are rather insensitive to the detailed shape of the @xmath31 distribution .",
    "our model calculation implies a local grb rate of @xmath187  grbs  yr@xmath28  gpc@xmath173 or 92 galactic events per myr . this is a higher rate than obtained in some recent estimates ( e.g. , wijers et al .",
    "1998 ) and indicates a better chance of detecting relatively young ( @xmath188  yr ) grb remnants in nearby galaxies . the photoionization signatures of such young grb remnants recently investigated in detail by perna et al .",
    "( 1999 ) might then serve as a critical test for the assumed correlation between grbs and star - forming regions .      the simplified analytic form used to represent the observed spectra from cosmological blast waves provides a reasonable representation of all three statistical distributions considered in this paper , thus lending strong support in favor of the external shock model of grbs .",
    "the width of the observed @xmath1 distribution may be regarded as evidence for the existence of burst sources with a wide range of baryon loading factors @xmath31 , as suggested by dermer et al .",
    "( 1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "our analysis only weakly constrains the existence of a population of dirty fireballs with lower values of @xmath31 , because these dirty fireballs are largely undetectable for batse due to the rapid decline of the observed peak flux in the batse photon energy range with decreasing @xmath31 .",
    "batse is therefore insensitive to a dirty fireball population except for the few events that occur at redshifts @xmath189 . the small number of grbs with @xmath190  kev in the data shown in figs .",
    "[ g_comp1 ] , [ g_comp2 ] , and [ fits ] might be , at least in part , an artifact of the selection bias mentioned at the beginning of the previous section , namely that @xmath1 can only be determined for bright bursts , while dirty fireballs , producing spectra with low @xmath1 , are intrinsically dim .",
    "also the existence of a population of clean fireball burst sources can not be constrained tightly on the basis of our results . however ,",
    "this conclusion is strongly dependent on the radiative regime of the average grb blast wave . for the value @xmath154 found in our study to be an appropriate choice to reproduce the peak flux , @xmath1 and duration distributions , an additional population of clean fireballs with @xmath31 much larger than the upper limit quoted above ( @xmath191 @xmath192 )",
    "can not be excluded , although it slightly worsens our modeling results .",
    "however , if a radiative regime @xmath193 is assumed , the decline of the peak flux with increasing @xmath194 becomes much slower , implying that clean fireballs would be detected as high-@xmath1 bursts , inconsistent with the observed @xmath1 distribution .",
    "we therefore conclude that our analysis is in accord with the existence of a class of dirty fireballs with @xmath195  kev which have generally not been detected with batse .",
    "also the existence of a significantly larger fraction of cleaner fireballs than detected by batse can not be excluded from our analysis , although its consistency with observations depends strongly on the best - fit radiative regime of the average grb blast wave .",
    "our results indicate that the most powerful grbs can be detected at redshifts @xmath175 .",
    "the slope of @xmath196 in the peak flux distribution seems to be a coincidence due to the particular distribution of burst source energies , @xmath136 , in combination with the non - euclidean space - time geometry .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that the burst with the highest redshift measured so far , grb  971214 , still has a rather high batse peak flux and fluence , while the closest grb for which a redshift estimate exists so far , grb  980425 , was a rather dim burst .",
    "in summary , we use a parametrization of the blast wave model to calculate the peak flux , duration , and @xmath0 peak energy of a grb with a prescribed set of intrinsic and environmental parameters .",
    "we assume that the evolution of the grb rate with redshift is proportional to the star - formation history of the universe . by taking into account triggering properties of grb detectors in our calculations",
    ", we make a detailed comparison of model distributions with batse results for the peak flux , @xmath29 , and @xmath1 distributions .",
    "we have shown how these distributions can be self - consistently modeled and used to extract fireball model parameters .",
    "our analysis shows that the observed statistical distributions of observables of grbs are in accord with the scenario that grbs are associated with sites of active star formation , although alternative cosmological distributions of grb sources , which have not been considered in this paper , can not be excluded .",
    "future work must consider evolutionary behaviors to test compact object coalescence scenarios .",
    "we argue that the short , hard grbs represent a separate population of burst sources ."
