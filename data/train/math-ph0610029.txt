    "finally we make some remarks about ill - posedness of our algorithm for finding @xmath0 given @xmath74 .",

    "finding @xmath60 satisfying is an ill - posed problem if @xmath85 is small .",
    "it is similar to solving the first - kind fredholm integral equation @xmath126 whose kernel is infinitely smooth .",
    "our solution shows the ill - posedness of the problem because the denominator in tends to zero as @xmath127 grows .",
    "methods for stable solutions of ill - posed problems ( see ramm ( 2005a ) ) should be applied to finding @xmath60 .",

    "if does not hold , one perturbs slightly @xmath60 according to lemma  [ l:4 ] , and get a potential @xmath128 by formula with @xmath116 in place of @xmath60 .",
    "in this section we present results of numerical experiments for a design of the material capable of focusing the incoming plane wave into a desired solid angle . first , let us note that a direct implementation of the algorithm presented in the previous sections produces potentials @xmath0 with large magnitudes ( of the order of @xmath129 ) in our examples .",
    "this happens because of the ill - posedness of the inverse scattering problem .",
    "to remedy this situation we have introduced an additional step in the potential reconstruction algorithm stated in section  [ s:4 ] .",

    "bound the magnitudes of the coefficients by a predetermined constant @xmath131 , that is @xmath132 let [ 5:e1 ] h(x)=^l_=0h_ , m(r ) y_ , m( ) .",
    "the bound on the function @xmath60 has the effect of bounding the potential @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure regularizes the ill - posedness of the reconstruction process as discussed at the end of section  [ s:4 ] .",
    "the ill - posedness manifests itself in the divergence of the series with @xmath133 , when the regularization we have used by introducing the bounding constant , is not applied .",
    "however , from the numerical observations , the series practically did not change with the increase in @xmath76 for @xmath134 . as expected , an increase in the value of @xmath135 improves the precision of the approximation of the desired scattering amplitude @xmath74 , but it also increases the magnitude of the potential @xmath0 .",
