    "semiconductor quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) driven by coherent pulses have been extensively suggested as promising candidates for physical implementation of solid state quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of selective control of the electronic occupation and a controllable energy spectrum are the major characteristics which allow qdms to be viable for the realization of universal quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of quantum dots ( qds ) as quantum information systems has been proven by successful implementation of controllable operations on charge  @xcite and optical qubits  @xcite .",
    "in addition to a feasible qubit physical implementation , quantum entanglement is a fundamental nonlocal resource for quantum computation and communication .",
    "although there are several theoretical approaches proposing methods for direct measurement of entanglement  @xcite , its experimental quantification remains elusive .",
    "optically induced entanglement of excitons has been performed in single qds  @xcite and qdms  @xcite , where interaction between particles and interdot tunneling are the key mechanisms for the formation of entangled states .",
    "several theoretical calculations have proposed different strategies to obtain exciton states in qdms with a high degree of entanglement  @xcite . also , the electron - hole entanglement can be efficiently tuned and optimized through the proper choice of interdot separation , qd asymmetry and by the action of an electric field applied in the growth direction  @xcite . in ideal conditions ,",
    "the qdm undergoes unitary evolution , the quantum entanglement is not affected by decoherence and its calculation can be easily performed by using von neumann entropy  @xcite . however , a system is unavoidable coupled with the environment which leads to degradation of quantum coherence . in these conditions , the system evolution is non - unitary and the decoherence effects cause deterioration of the entanglement and will be detrimental for production , manipulation and detection of entangled states .",
    "for qdms the main decoherence channels are the radiative decay of excitons and exciton pure dephasing which is important even at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the definition of a computable quantifier of entanglement for general mixed states in open quantum systems has been a challenge for the last decades  @xcite . among the diverse bipartite entanglement measurements ,",
    "entanglement of formation  @xcite and concurrence  @xcite are well - defined and extensively used to evaluate the entanglement of mixed bipartite in @xmath3 systems .",
    "an alternative measure for mixed states is negativity , @xmath4 , first proposed by vidal and werner  @xcite , which overcomes the limitations of other measurements and allows to calculate the degree of entanglement for general @xmath0 composite vector spaces  @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that , in the context of qdms , electron - hole entanglement was previously investigated using the von neumann entropy ignoring the essential effects of decoherence  @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the entanglement degree of electron - hole pairs created in qdms by the incidence of coherent radiation considering spontaneous exciton decay and pure dephasing as main decoherence sources .",
    "the degree of entanglement in the asymptotic regime is evaluated through the negativity @xmath4 as a function of controllable physical parameters , exploring the conditions which maximize the entanglement degree .",
    "our results show that the system evolves to asymptotic states induced by dissipative mechanisms which are superpositions of indirect exciton states . for experimentally accessible conditions ,",
    "such states have a long lifetimes  @xcite and high degree of entanglement .",
    "we consider a qdm composed by two asymmetric qds vertically aligned and separated by a barrier of width @xmath5 .",
    "the electron - hole occupation is controlled by the interplay of tunneling coupling , optical excitation and gate potentials . due to structural asymmetry of qds ,",
    "the energy levels of each carrier become resonant for specific values of an external electric field @xmath1 applied along the growth direction of the qdm .",
    "a careful growth engineering along with the natural qdm asymmetry allows the design of samples with selective tunneling of electrons or holes  @xcite .    in order to investigate the entanglement between electron and hole , we model our system using a composite particle position basis @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represent the occupation number of electrons and holes in each level in the top ( t ) or bottom ( b ) qd , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the qdm is driven by a low - intensity continuous wave laser , such that only the ground - state exciton can be formed .",
    "the occupation of the electron or the hole in each qd should be 0 or 1 , where the value 0 ( or 1 ) represents the absence ( presence ) of the carrier in the qd .",
    "for instance , the ket @xmath8 represents an indirect exciton state , with one electron occupying the top qd and one hole in the bottom qd .",
    "thus , the qd position index encodes the information of a specific quantum state and the complete basis set of the composite system @xmath9 is comprised by 16-states .",
    "considering only the optical active transitions , tunneling of electrons and holes and assuming that the qdm is initially uncharged , the qdm system is described using the composite basis @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . under electric - dipole and rotating - wave approximations and after removing the time dependence , the resulting hamiltonian is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the detuning of the incident laser and the exciton states , @xmath17 is the stark energy shift on the indirect excitons  @xcite , being @xmath5 the barrier thickness between the qds .",

    "although the coupling mechanism between indirect exciton states can not be distinguished directly from hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , this is a result of the combined action of both , electron and hole tunnelings .",
    "this can be checked by projecting out the direct exciton states of the total hamiltonian to obtain the effective coupling between indirect excitons which is found to be proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "it is also found that the effective coupling between the vacuum state and indirect excitons is nearly proportional to @xmath40 .",

    "the anticrossings of type @xmath32 and @xmath33 are directly related to the emergence of strong electron - hole entanglement as shown in refs .  .",

    "corresponding to indirect states anticrossing @xmath36 , the von neumann entropy @xmath46 attains 75% of its maximum value @xmath47 .",
    "this high degree of entanglement observed at anticrossing @xmath36 is interesting for two reasons : i ) indirect exciton superpositions with large entanglement in qdm can be engineered at @xmath37 by a suitable choice of hamiltonian parameters , and ii ) in previous work  @xcite , we proved that at the condition @xmath37 , the system evolves to an asymptotic superposition of vacuum and indirect exciton states , which is protected against decoherence . at this point , it is important to stress that the controlled production of entangled states as robust quantum superpositions is one of the key ingredient in the design of any quantum information system .",
    "whereas the emergence of robust states in qdm is determined by the competitive effects of decoherence and tunneling , it is necessary to determine if the large values of entanglement are preserved under the same decoherence mechanisms .",

    "we can see that for typical excitations range , the @xmath21 values that maximize the negativity ( dark blue region ) follow approximately the same dependence on @xmath5 as the tunneling @xmath99 .",
    "from the analysis of the open system , we found a regime where it is possible to obtain superpositions of states with a high degree of entanglement .",
    "we use this parameter regime as a guide to investigate whether the entanglement remains robust to the effects of decoherence . in the open system",
    ", we found that the dynamics of the qdm converges to a superposition with a high degree of entanglement and simultaneously protected against decoherence . from our results , it is important to recall that the high degree of entanglement is sustained by the interplay of vacuum and decoherence .",
