    "the decidability of the satisfiability problem of various extensions of @xmath10has been studied ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the order in which quantifiers are written determines dependence relations between variables .",
    "for example , when using game theoretic semantics to evaluate the formula @xmath23 the choice for @xmath24 depends on the value for @xmath25 , and the choice for @xmath26 depends on the value of both universally quantified variables @xmath25 and @xmath27 . the characteristic feature of @xmath18and @xmath17is that in these logics it is possible to express dependencies between variables that can not be expressed in @xmath5 . the first step in this direction",
    "was taken by henkin @xcite with his partially ordered quantifiers @xmath28 where @xmath24 depends only on @xmath25 and @xmath26 depends only on @xmath27 .",
    "enderton @xcite and walkoe @xcite observed that exactly the properties definable in existential second - order logic ( @xmath29 ) can be expressed with partially ordered quantifiers .",

    "for example , in @xmath30 the quantifier @xmath31 means that @xmath26 is `` independent '' of @xmath25 in the sense that a choice for the value of @xmath26 should not depend on what the value of @xmath25 is .",
    "the semantics of @xmath17was first formulated in game theoretic terms , and @xmath17can be regarded as a game theoretically motivated generalization of @xmath5 . whereas the semantic game for @xmath5is a game of perfect information , the game for @xmath17is a game of imperfect information",
    "the so - called team semantics of @xmath17 , also used in this paper , was introduced by hodges @xcite .",
    "dependence logic , introduced by vnnen @xcite , was inspired by @xmath17-logic , but the approach of vnnen provided a fresh perspective on quantifier dependence . in dependence logic",
    "the dependence relations between variables are written in terms of novel atomic dependence formulas .",
    "for example , the partially ordered quantifier can be expressed in dependence logic as follows @xmath32 the atomic formula @xmath33 has the explicit meaning that @xmath26 is completely determined by @xmath27 and nothing else .    in recent years ,",
    "research related to @xmath17and @xmath18has been active .",
    "a variety of closely related logics have been defined and various applications suggested , see e.g.  @xcite .",
