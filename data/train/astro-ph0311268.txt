    "accretion disks are commonly believed to be present in both cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and quasi - stellar objects and active galactic nuclei ( qsos / agn ) . in both types of object blue - shifted absorption troughs in uv resonance lines",
    "are sometimes present .",
    "therefore , a popular scenario put forth to explain them involves outflowing winds emanating from an accretion disk , with the winds giving rise to absorption troughs in the objects spectra when they are viewed along preferential sight - lines .",
    "however , while this scenario is well motivated , the driving mechanism for the winds is still debatable .    in cvs , the p - cygni type line profiles are observed only at inclination angles close to the pole ( i.e. , at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 corresponds to the disk rotation axis ) when there are high inferred mass accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given these requirements , the obvious source of the wind material is the disk itself .",
    "the terminal velocities of the blue - shifted absorption troughs lie in the range @xmath2 , which is comparable to escape velocities in the inner disk regions surrounding the white dwarf .    in qsos ,",
    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) from an outflowing wind are observed in @xmath3 of qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "outflow velocities up to @xmath4 are common",
    ". however , it is not clear to what degree the detection of bals is an orientation - angle effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as is the case for cvs , or if instead bal qsos are a distinct qso type with some special intrinsic or evolutionary properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless ,",
    "if accretion disks power qsos / agn , some viewing angle effects are likely to be present .",
    "@xcite cited evidence for and speculated that the outflowing bal gas may result from material being radially driven off an inner rotating disk , however the 1d model of @xcite was the first serious attempt to explain qso / agn observations using an accretion disk wind .",
    "another property that cvs and qsos have in common is the existence of persistent velocity structure in their absorption troughs ( when present ) over significantly long time scales .",
    "this steady velocity structure , with changes @xmath5 @xmath6 , persists at least up to years and decades , for cvs and qsos , respectively .",
    "however , changes in the depths of the absorption have been observed in both classes of objects .",
    "for some relevant observations showing the behaviors see @xcite and @xcite for results on cvs and @xcite and @xcite for results on qsos .",
    "the behavior of the absorption in q1303 + 308 @xcite is possibly very illustrative , with more recent data showing that the absorption depth has steadily increased over 20 years while the underlying velocity structure persists ( foltz , private communication ) .    to explain cvs @xcite developed 2.5d dynamical models of line - driven disk winds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they concluded that steady wind solutions do exist and that wind terminal velocities are approximately independent of disk luminosity , similar to line - driven winds in early - type stars .",
    "they found that the mass - loss rate increased with disk luminosity and that rotational forces were important , causing velocity streamlines to collide and reduce speed , giving rise to an enhanced density region where the strongest absorption occurs .",
    "although the approximations of single scattering and constant ionization were made , these models are generally consistent with observations and they show a strong dependence on inclination angle .",
    "@xcite also developed 2.5d models for cvs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of their results , for example the magnitude of the wind velocities , were similar to those obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , a significant difference between the two groups was that @xcite found unsteady flows characterized by large amplitude fluctuations in velocity and density on very short time scales .    for qsos",
    "/ agn the 1d models of @xcite indicate that , with an appropriate x - ray shielding mechanism , a suitable accretion disk wind can be driven off by line radiation pressure . unlike the case for cvs ,",
    "the wind streamlines are approximately parallel to the disk at high velocities ( i.e. , close to inclination angles near @xmath7 ) .",
    "the models of @xcite are able to account for the observed outflow velocities seen in bal qsos , the presence of detached absorption troughs seen in some bal qsos , and the approximate fraction of qsos observed to have bals .",
    "but the 2.5d qso / agn line - driven wind models of @xcite challenge this result .",
    "similar to their earlier cv disk - wind models , @xcite and @xcite report finding intrinsically unsteady winds .",
    "proga and collaborators have suggested that since their unsteady line - driven disk - wind models are inconsistent with observational results , `` that a factor other than line - driving is much more likely to be decisive in powering these outflows '' @xcite absorption equivalent width do not scale with disk luminosity .",
    "however , this argument should not be used to invalidate line - driven disk wind models since the civ@xmath8 absorption equivalent width may not be a direct measure of mass loss rate , e.g. , due to ionization changes . ] and that `` indeed radiation pressure alone does not suffice to drive the observed hypersonic flow '' @xcite . however , the line - driven disk - wind models of pereyra and collaborators ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) continue to find steady wind solutions , similar to the earlier cv models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , an impasse of sorts has developed with regard to the applicability of line - driven accretion disk wind models to cvs and qsos / agn .",
    "clearly the observations indicate that steady winds do exist in these objects .",
    "however , while one group believes that steady line - driven winds can be achieved , the other group has advocated either abandoning this approach or adopting one that incorporates additional physics ( e.g. , magnetic fields ) into the problem .",
    "therefore , the objective of this work is to develop a series of semi - analytical models , independent of previous 2.5d dynamical efforts , to test for the existence / nonexistence of steady disk winds .",
    "_ we find that steady winds can exist _ and here we emphasize the physics behind these solutions by employing mathematically simple models designed to mimic a disk environment . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will present detailed numerical calculations .    in  [ sec_general_equations ] we present the notation and general equations used in this paper .",

    "for this reason @xmath56 has little influence on the fundamental characteristics of wind solutions , and thus will simply taken to be zero in much of the remaining analysis .",
    "the question of the existence of a steady solution is then reduced to determining whether a value of @xmath57 and a normalized function @xmath58 exists such that it satisfies the boundary conditions and equation  ( [ equ_motion_w ] ) . a steady solution for a 1d hydrodynamical model exists if and only if equation  ( [ equ_motion_w ] ) is integrable while simultaneously satisfying the boundary conditions .",

    "motivated by analogies between line - driven winds and a supersonic nozzle @xcite , we have found that insights can be obtained by defining and considering the nozzle function , @xmath59 .",
    "the relationship between the nozzle function , the critical point , and the existence / nonexistence of a steady 1d wind solution is elaborated in this section . since mathematical expressions associated with critical point conditions have forms which readily allow for physical interpretation , we discuss the nozzle function and critical point conditions simultaneously .    in  [ sec_s0_a05 ] we initially analyze the simple case where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this case results in an explicit analytical expression for @xmath62 from the equation of motion [ equation  ( [ equ_motion_w ] ) ] . in  [ sec_s0 ] we extend the results to include an arbitrary value for @xmath10 ( @xmath63 ) . in  [ sec_sg0 ]",
    "we briefly discuss the case of a finite sound speed ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "we note that although gas pressure does not produce significant corrections to wind mass loss rates and velocity laws for typical cv and qso parameters , gas pressure effects do give rise to the necessity of a critical point in order for the wind solution to be steady .",

    "also , just as is the case with negligible gas pressure , the nozzle function in a line - driven wind must also present a minimum if a steady supersonic wind solution is to exist .",
    "another similarity , also discussed by @xcite for stellar winds , comes from the propagation velocity of density perturbations at the critical point . in a supersonic nozzle",
    "the sonic point , which is at the minimum of the nozzle cross sectional area , is the point where the flow velocity equals the propagation velocity of density perturbations ( i.e. , the sound speed ) . in a line - driven wind",

    "we consider the case of zero sound speed only ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "this increase is due to flux emanating from interior radii .",
    "the o  model is defined through the expression ( see figure  [ fig_o_f ] )    @xmath137    in figure  [ fig_o_n ] we present the nozzle function @xmath59 of the o  model ( with @xmath60 ) .",
    "the critical point is determined by the minimum of @xmath59 , which in turn gives the value of the normalized wind mass loss rate @xmath57 . in figure  [ fig_o_v ]",
    "we present the velocity law of the o  model derived through numerical integration starting from the critical point . as with the i  model ,",
    "we compute the nozzle function and the velocity law of the o  model for @xmath116 , but the corresponding corrections due to gas pressure were insignificant , so again we do not plot this to avoid redundancy .",
    "figure  [ fig_o_b ] shows the nozzle function @xmath59 plotted simultaneously with the product @xmath135 ) \\dot{m}$ ] .",
    "these two graphs intersect at , and only at , the critical point .",
    "since @xmath117)$ ] is a monotonically increasing function , the critical point must be ( slightly ) to right of the nozzle minimum .",
    "figure  [ fig_o_num ] shows the results from the time - dependent simulation for the o  model . again",
    "the solid line is the initial velocity distribution at @xmath119 and the short dash - long dashed line is the velocity distribution found once the code arrives at a steady state .",
    "again this is in excellent agreement with the steady state solution found through the stationary codes , indicating that the steady solutions found through the stationary codes for model  o are stable .",
    "the objective of this work is to determine , in a manner independent of from results of previous numerically - intensive 2.5d hydrodynamic simulations , whether steady line - driven disk wind solutions exist or not .",
    "the motive behind this objective is to , in turn , determine whether line - driven disk winds could potentially account for the wide / broad uv resonance absorption lines seen in cvs and qsos . in both types of objects , it is observationally inferred that the associated absorption troughs have steady velocity structure .",
    "our main conclusion is that if the accretion disk is steady , then the corresponding line - driven disk winds emanating from it can also be steady .",
    "we have confirmed this conclusion with more realistic ( and mathematically more elaborate ) models that we will present in a subsequent paper which implements the exact flux distribution above a standard shakura - sunyaev disk .",
    "this paper , in particular , has sought to emphasize on the underlying physics behind the steady nature of line - driven disk winds through mathematically simple models that mimic the disk environment .",
    "the local disk wind mass loss rates and local disk wind velocity laws represented by the standard simple models of this work are a consequence of balancing the gravitational forces and the radiation pressure forces .",
    "although gas pressure is present , we find that in our models inclusion of gas pressure gives rise to only minor corrections to the overall results .",
    "the balance between gravitational and radiation pressure forces is represented quantitatively through a nozzle function .",
    "the spatial dependence of the nozzle function is a key issue in determining the steady / unsteady nature of supersonic wind solutions . in the case of a steady solution which neglects gas pressure effects",
    ", the minimum of the nozzle function determines the corresponding wind mass loss rate and the position of the minimum determines the critical point .    in the vicinity of the disk ,",
    "gas pressure effects only produce minor corrections to the nozzle function , namely the critical point is shifted slightly to the right of the nozzle minimum , where the nozzle function has a positive derivative .",
    "however , in cases where the nozzle function is monotonically decreasing ( as in the s  model ) , these minor corrections generate a minimum in the nozzle function at a finite distance from the disk surface , i.e. , shifting the critical point from infinity to a finite distance .",
    "the steady nature of line - driven disk winds found in this paper is consistent with the steady nature of the streamline disk wind models of murray and collaborators @xcite , and it is also consistent with the 2.5d time - dependent models of pereyra and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we wish to thank kenneth g. gayley and norman w. murray for many useful discussions .",
    "for this case equation  ( [ equ_motion_w ] ) is the equation of motion . from an analysis similar to that presented by @xcite , this equation , in the supersonic wind region , has two solution branches which exist under the condition that    @xmath139    the two branches intersect at the critical point when both sides of equation  ( [ equ_mdotn ] ) are equal . as is apparent from equation  ( [ equ_mdotn ] )",
    ", the critical point conditions now depend on @xmath42 and @xmath140 rather than only @xmath42 as in cases where @xmath60 ( see  [ sec_s0_a05 ] and  [ sec_s0 ] ) .    the definition of the nozzle function [ cf .",
    "equation  ( [ equ_n_s0 ] ) ] is now extended to include gas pressure in an isothermal wind using the following equation    @xmath141    we also define the function @xmath142 as    @xmath143    the reason for choosing equation  ( [ equ_n ] ) as the definition for the nozzle function when gas pressure effects are included are threefold .",
    "first , the definition of @xmath142 [ equation  ( [ equ_b ] ) ] allows for a simple relationship with the wind mass loss rate , conserving its physical interpretation respect to the @xmath60 case . as we discuss below , adding gas pressure effects will shift the critical point slightly to the right of the minimum where the nozzle function has a positive derivative .",
    "second , equation  ( [ equ_n ] ) reduces to the exact expression for the nozzle function for the @xmath60 case ( equation  [ [ equ_n_s0 ] ] ) .",
    "third , equation  ( [ equ_n ] ) depends only on @xmath42 ( not on @xmath144 ) .",
    "the importance of the @xmath42-only - dependence is that it allows for the development of mathematical / numerical analysis of the problem without having to integrate the equation of motion . in particular",
    ", one could determine through the above nozzle function whether or not steady local wind solutions about a given spatial point exist , without having to integrate the equation of motion .",
    "this may lead to interesting future physical results , as well as serve as a testing tool for numerical models aimed at representing line - driven disk winds .",
    "the condition for the existence of two solution branches can now be written as    @xmath145    if the condition that @xmath146 holds , then we find that    @xmath147    since we require a critical point type solution ( see  [ sec_critical ] ) , a necessary condition for the critical point position is    @xmath148    we will demonstrate this in more detail in a future paper .",
    "we emphasize that this applies when gas pressure effects are included in an isothermal wind .",
    "the actual critical point position is determined by a numerical iterative process that successively integrates the equation of motion until the condition @xmath149 is met .",
    "this is equivalent to the iterative process used by @xcite in their original line - driven stellar wind paper . a consequence of equation  ( [ equ_nozzlecondition ] )",
    "is that when gas pressure effects are included , the critical point is no longer _",
    "exactly _ at nozzle minimum , but in all the models we have explored , the critical point position is shifted slightly to the right of the nozzle minimum where the nozzle has a positive derivative .",
    "as discussed above , the equation of motion [ equation  ( [ equ_motion_w ] ) ] is integrable if upon integration one can always determine ( i.e. , a steady solution exists ; assuming the boundary condition can be met ) ,        viewing @xmath151 as a function of variables @xmath42 and @xmath140 which satisfies equation  ( [ equ_motion_w ] ) , one can divide the @xmath42-@xmath144 plane into five regions depending on whether a solution for @xmath62 exists .",
    "we do this below in a manner equivalent to , and following the notation of , @xcite for early type stars :                  a wind solution must therefore start in region  i , since this is the only subsonic region which determines a value for @xmath62 .",
    "since we are assuming that the wind must end supersonic , the solution must continue on to region  ii .",
    "region  ii has two values for @xmath62 , the lower / higher value corresponding to the lower / higher branch .",
    "the solution in region  i is continuous with the lower branch of region  ii , therefore the needed solution must go from region  i to the lower branch of region  ii as it goes from subsonic to supersonic .              in turn , the solution of region  iii is continuous with the upper branch of region  ii .",
    "therefore , at some large @xmath42 , the solution must go from the upper branch of region  ii into region  iii .",
    "continuity of @xmath62 implies that the lower and higher branch solutions must intersect at a point which is on the boundary between region  ii and region  iv .",
    "this intersection point is the critical point of the solution .",
    "we refer to solutions to the equation of motion with the above characteristics as critical point type solutions .",
    "we have therefore shown that a steady monotonically increasing continuous wind solution that starts subsonic , reaches supersonic speeds , and extends to infinity must be a critical point type solution of the equation of motion .",
