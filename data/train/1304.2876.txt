    "the azimuthal dependence of 3d hbt radii with respect to an event plane gives us information on the source shape at freeze - out .",
    "it also provides information on the system s evolution by comparing it to the initial source shape . the higher harmonic flow ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc ) of particles has recently been measured at rhic and the lhc .",
    "it is primarily due to the spatial fluctuation of the initial density of the collision area . a hydrodynamic model calculation @xcite reports that the shape of the initial fluctuations resulting in a triangular component of the initial shape may be preserved until freeze - out .",
    "hbt measurements relative to a higher - order event plane may reveal this feature .",
    "azimuthal hbt radii with respect to the @xmath0-order event plane have been measured for charged pions and kaons in @xmath4 = 200 gev au+au collisions at phenix @xcite .",
    "it was found that the final eccentricity of kaons , which is defined as @xmath5 = 2@xmath6/@xmath7 @xcite , is larger than that of pions and almost the same as the initial eccentricity .",
    "however , since hbt radii show a transverse mass ( @xmath8 ) dependence and the average @xmath8 of pions and kaons are different , the @xmath8 dependence needs to be considered in the comparison of the final eccentricities .",
    "figure [ fig : hbt_e2 ] shows the relative amplitude of the azimuthal hbt radii for charged pions and kaons as a function of @xmath9 for two centrality bins .",
    "the left top panel corresponds to the final eccentricity ; there is still a difference between pions and kaons in non - central collisions even at the same @xmath9 .",
    "this difference may be due to different cross - sections of pions and kaons .",
    "the relative amplitudes of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at low @xmath8 in the most central collisions have finite values although the final eccentricity is almost close to zero .",
    "this result may indicate a temporal variation of the emission duration of particles because @xmath10 and @xmath11 contain temporal information in addition to geometrical information .",

    "the oscillation of @xmath10 may carry information about the duration of the emission .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence may indicate that the emission duration is different in - plane versus out - of - plane since @xmath12 shows a weak oscillation and the source shape is thought to be close to a circle",
    ". the @xmath14 dependence may be also due to the difference of emission duration between different azimuthal directions .",
