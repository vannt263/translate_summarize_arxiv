    "in a model aimed at providing quantum mechanics with a geometrical framework @xcite , caianiello introduced the upper limit @xmath3 to the proper acceleration of a particle .",
    "this mass dependent limit , or maximal acceleration ( ma ) , can be derived from quantum mechanical considerations and the fact that the acceleration is largest in the particle rest frame @xcite .",
    "the absolute value of the proper acceleration therefore satisfies the inequality @xmath4 .",
    "no counterexamples are known to the validity of this inequality .",
    "classical and quantum arguments supporting the existence of a ma have been given in the literature @xcite .",
    "ma also appears in the context of weyl space @xcite and of a geometrical analogue of vigier s stochastic theory @xcite .",
    "it is invoked as a tool to rid black hole entropy of ultraviolet divergences @xcite and is at times regarded as a regularization procedure @xcite that avoids the introduction of a fundamental length @xcite , thus preserving the continuity of space - time .",
    "an upper limit on the acceleration also exists in string theory @xcite when the acceleration induced by the background gravitational field reaches the critical value @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath7 are string size , mass and tension . at accelerations larger than @xmath8 the string extremities become casually disconnected .",
    "frolov and sanchez @xcite have found that a universal critical acceleration must be a general property of strings .",
    "it is the same cut  off required by sanchez in order to regularize the entropy and the free energy of quantum strings @xcite",
    ".    applications of caianiello s model include cosmology @xcite , the dynamics of accelerated strings @xcite and neutrino oscillations @xcite and the determination of a lower neutrino mass bound @xcite .",
    "the model also makes the metric observer  dependent , as conjectured by gibbons and hawking @xcite .",
    "the model has been applied to classical @xcite and quantum particles @xcite falling in the gravitational field of a collapsing , spherically symmetric object described by the schwarzschild metric and also to the reissner - nordstrm @xcite and kerr @xcite metrics . in the model , the end product of stellar collapse",
    "is represented by compact , impenetrable astrophysical objects whose radiation characteristics are similar to those of known bursters @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the model for the classical electrodynamics of a particle @xcite , the mass of the higgs boson @xcite and the lamb shift in hydrogenic atoms @xcite have been worked out .",
    "ma effects in muonic atoms @xcite and on helicity and chirality of particles @xcite have also been investigated .",
    "most recently rovelli and vidotto in two important works have found evidence for ma and singularity resolution in covariant loop quantum gravity @xcite,@xcite .",
    "caianiello s model is based on an embedding procedure @xcite that stipulates that the line element experienced by an accelerating particle is represented by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a background gravitational field .",
    "the effective space - time geometry given by ( [ eq1 ] ) therefore exhibits mass - dependent corrections that in general induce curvature and violations of the equivalence principle .",
    "this process , normally forbidden by conservation of energy and momentum , is allowed in the ma model.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the purpose of this paper is to determine the radiation characteristics of an accelerating charged fermion in the field of the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) in the process described by fig.[fig : feynman2 ] .",
    "we tackle the problem in two distinct ways , first by using solutions of the covariant dirac equation that are exact to first order in the metric deviation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the metric of flat space - time ( of signature -2 ) . in these relativistic solutions",
    "the ma field of ( [ eq1 ] ) appears in a phase factor and the riemann tensor is linearized .",
    "this approach is suitable to study the effects of ma when @xmath13 . in the second approach , more suitable for extreme accelerations , we consider the effects of the ricci scalar and of its physical singularity at @xmath14 on the index of refraction of the incoming fermion . in this way some aspects of the problem at more elevated accelerations can be considered .",
    "the single - vertex diagram selected represents , potentially , the largest contribution to the radiation process .",
    "it is however forbidden kinematically in minkowski space .",
    "let us consider in fact the process @xmath15 in which an incoming massive particle of momentum @xmath16 and dispersion relation @xmath17 produces a photon of momentum @xmath18 , while the outgoing particle has momentum @xmath19 .",
    "conservation of energy - momentum requires @xmath20 . in the rest frame of @xmath21 we have @xmath22 , which gives @xmath23 , @xmath24 and again @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 leads to @xmath27 which shows that for @xmath28 , the case considered , we get @xmath29 and the process becomes physically meaningless .",
    "there are processes , however , in which massive particles emitting a photon are not kinematically forbidden .",
    "this is certainly the case when gravitation alters the dispersion relations of at least one of the particles involved @xcite .",
    "this is also the case with ma @xcite .",
    "because ma acts as a gravitational field according to ( [ eq1 ] ) , we can also expect changes in the index of refraction and dispersion relations of the incoming , accelerating fermion .",
    "let us consider , for simplicity , the case of hyperbolic motion in which the fermion always experiences a constant acceleration @xmath30 . from ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we immediately obtain the modified minkowski metric @xmath31 for that region of space - time delimited by the physical branch of the hyperbola @xmath32 .",

    "a better perspective on the behaviour of a fermion closer to the limit @xmath2 can be acquired by introducing a different approximation to the dispersion relation of the fermion in the ma field .",

    "it is in fact the index of refraction that by altering the dispersion relations of the fermion , and of any other particle in general , makes the process possible in vacuo .",
    "note that unlike the case of erenkov radiation , it is not required that the photon be emitted in a medium .",
    "the radiation power laws differ according to whether one considers the low - acceleration , or the high - acceleration regimes . by comparing @xmath153 and @xmath139 with the power radiated by a fermion in a gravitational field @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the impact parameter of the source",
    ", we find that in both instances @xmath161 is replaced by factors of @xmath68 , while the dependence on @xmath162 remains the same .",
    "quantum mechanics is , of course , formulated in terms of particle momenta and one therefore expects a dependence on y in ( [ gf ] ) , as well as in ( [ w ] ) and ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "note , however that for @xmath163 , the factor @xmath164 is a characteristic of the source , while @xmath68 itself depends on @xmath0 via @xmath2 and changes essentially from particle to particle .",
    "for @xmath165 the radiation emitted by the charged fermion is such that @xmath166 , while @xmath167 if @xmath168 at extreme accelerations , provided @xmath68 applies in each case to the same particle .",
    "it therefore follows , from a comparison of @xmath153 and @xmath139 with ( [ gf ] ) , that _",
    "caianiello s model allows , in principle , the use of charged particles as tools to distinguish inertial from gravitational fields locally_. this is an interesting feature of the model that is not permissible in a purely classical theory @xcite .",
    "the result is a direct consequence of the quantum violations of the equivalence principle that ma introduces .",
    "these violations disappear when @xmath169 .    because the role of the gravitational field is so essential in the process of fig.[fig : feynman2 ] , it is expected that the procedures outlined in this work and in @xcite will be of use in extended theories of gravity @xcite",

    "<S> we derive the radiation characteristics of an accelerated , charged particle in a model due to caianiello in which the proper acceleration of a particle of mass @xmath0 has the upper limit @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find two power laws , one applicable to lower accelerations , the other more suitable for accelerations closer to @xmath2 and to the related physical singularity in the ricci scalar . </S>",
    "<S> geometrical constraints and power spectra are also discussed . by comparing the power laws due to the maximal acceleration with that for particles in gravitational fields , we find that the model of caianiello allows , in principle , the use of charged particles as tools to distinguish inertial from gravitational fields locally . </S>"
