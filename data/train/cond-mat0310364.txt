    "stripe formation in the high-@xmath0 oxides has been widely considered by many theorists in the recent years .",
    "the present experimental evidences point to a curious electronic order , where carriers introduced by doping ( holes ) segregate into ` rivers of charge ' .",
    "those structures , generically called _ stripes _ , are considered as ` nearly one dimensional ' objects immersed in an insulating antiferromagnetic sea of spins .",
    "this picture was inferred more accurately after recent neutron diffraction experiments @xcite , which observed incommensurable antiferromagnetic domains separated by charge stripes localized in the nel wall regions .",
    "it is found that the magnetic scattering peaks define a superzone which is half the size of the one associated with the charge order , indicating that stripes introduce a @xmath1-phase shift between neighboring magnetic domains .",
    "the above structure results from competing effects , which in conjunction , reduce the energy cost for breaking antiferromagnetic bonds and minimize the kinetic energy of holes .",
    "the incommensurability of the peaks with the reciprocal lattice is a strong argument in favor of the idea that holes condense in stripes of finite width oriented along a given direction in the insulating planes .",
    "the temperature dependence of the peak splitting , showing that in some systems the charge - ordered peaks appear at higher temperatures than the magnetic ones @xcite , also discards the hypothesis of nested fermi surfaces .",
    "currently , the stripe picture is considered as a good candidate for explaining many of the properties ( normal and superconducting ) of the high-@xmath2 and other layered oxides@xcite .",
    "in contrast , there is still a lot of controversy about the nature of the correct spin order at the nel walls , _",
    "i.e _ spiral or collinear .",
    "both of them are possible under the available experimental data @xcite , despite theoretical difficulties to justify spiral order for the ground state @xcite .",
    "another key point concerning the stability of stripes is their robustness in the absence of long - range antiferromagnetism , at temperatures considerably above of the three - dimensional nel ordering .",
    "they even survive the absence of two - dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations , which occurs at higher temperature , showing that the transition is charge - driven@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is ascribed to the separation of charge and spin fluctuations @xcite , which establishes strong dynamic correlations that lower the large energy due to the hole repulsion inside the stripes .",
    "this behavior is quite ubiquitous in all oxide families , except for the chromium oxides , where the stripe and spin orders collapse together @xcite .",
    "the current idea among theorists ( originally suggested by anderson @xcite ) is that a sufficiently large repulsive on - site @xmath3 potential might allow for antiferromagnetism in the oxygen planes .",
    "the antiparallel alignment of the antiferromagnetic ordering at half filling , lowers perturbatively the kinetic energy in doped samples , because carriers ( holes in most cases ) can hop to neighboring sites .",
    "antiferromagnetism also produce an attractive force among holes , in order to minimize the number of broken antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "the competition between this short range attraction and the long range coulomb repulsion of holes , may stabilize the non - homogeneous phase of stripes , frustrating the tendency to macroscopic phase separation .",
    "from the view point of continuous models , the hole repulsion competes with the `` helicity '' of the spiral spin order , meaning that the antiphase of domains is crucial to achieve the thermodynamic stability of the stripe regime@xcite",
    ". the other possibility , magnetic domains in phase , should be unstable in relation to the homogeneous state .",
    "this fact , also rules out the ising limit , with very narrow walls between domains .",
    "the physics involved in the present problem , embraces as much the long range scale of charge interactions as the microscopic scale of spin fluctuations , where theoretical considerations in the basis of a macroscopic mean field may seem meaningless at first sight .",
    "however , for the stripe regime , spin - spin and charge - charge correlation lengths should be comparable in a certain region of doping and temperature , with non - vanishing two - dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations . in spite that long range antiferromagnetic order is not attained in two dimensions , typical correlation lengths are of the order of @xmath4 lattice parameters@xcite .",
    "we then define a two - dimensional @xmath5 as the temperature where the magnetic neutron diffraction peaks are not resolved any more@xcite . in a similar way , a critical point @xmath6 for the stripe order is assumed@xcite .",
    "the above facts justify a theoretical treatment using the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approach to elucidate the internal structure of stripes .",
    "the central idea of this paper is to assess the properties of the phase diagram , shown in a qualitative fashion in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and to theorize about the nature of the corresponding phase transitions .",
    "we will concentrate our study in two regions , where controversial statements are found in the literature , namely region li , for the incompressible stripe phase below @xmath5 , and region hi , for the paramagnetic phase immediately below the stripe critical point @xmath6 .",
    "we will show that the charge distribution suffers a transition of commensurability , which evolves from the low incommensurable regime in phase li , characterized by a typical soliton - like distribution , to a highly incommensurable one , which extends until phase hi and collapses at @xmath7 , following possibly a second order transition .    in the first step of the calculation , we study the marginal stripe phase transition below @xmath5 , building a gl free energy with the staggered magnetization as the main order parameter ( op ) and the charge density playing the role of a secondary op .",
    "this construction is based on a microscopic picture , which is supplemented by symmetry considerations .",
    "in contrast , in the second part of the paper , we study the highly incommensurable phase in the absence of antiferromagnetism , the transition being driven by the charge density .",
    "we develop theoretical arguments entirely based on symmetry to build the gl free energy for the hi phase , where the cdw is harmonic in the vicinity of @xmath8 .",
    "we calculate the amplitude and wavelength of the cdw and estimate the limits of the harmonic approximation .",
    "this one and other conjectured phases are displayed in the diagram of fig.1 .",
    "we end the paper with a discussion of our results .",
    "attention has been paid by some theorists to the tendency of attraction between domain walls at large distance .",
    "priadko and coworkers @xcite believe that this fact leads to an ubiquitous tendency to phase segregation that renders the stripes unstable in the small doping limit .",
    "they demonstrated the existence of an attractive force between asymptotically separated charged domain walls when the charge effect is considered in first order by means of a chemical potential . here",
    ", we argue that the spin exchange `` traps '' the holes inside domain walls , leading to a direct competition between the spin order attraction and the long range repulsion of holes , which stabilizes the inter - stripe separation . in spite that charges play the role of a secondary op , their interactions must be included at least in second order in the free energy . in the cuprate case , it is experimentally known that for the doping range @xmath9 , the effect of doping increasing is counterbalanced by the reduction of the domain width @xmath10 , and _ vice - versa _ , following the empirical relation @xmath11 . in this phase , the stripes are internally charge incompressible and the low doping regime may be simply thought as a re - scaling of the non - interacting stripe system .",
    "first of all , we propose a constraint in the form of a global charge conservation @xmath12 where the integration is performed over a two dimensional system with linear dimensions @xmath13 , with the @xmath14-axis along the charge modulation direction . from now on , the charge of holes , the electron spin , and the lattice constant are normalized to unity and will be omitted .",
    "if the stripes are non - interacting , the system can be rescaled along the direction @xmath14 in terms of the domain width @xmath10 , considering that two neighboring stripes are infinitely distant ( _ i.e. _ @xmath15 ) .",
    "this way , the charge conservation principle can be simply restated as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a scalar function of temperature , @xmath17 being proportional to a linear charge density @xmath18 divided by the number of domains @xmath19 along the modulation direction , _ i.e_. @xmath20 or @xmath21 . therefore , the constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) is quite appropriate for the low doping regime .",
    "the total energy of each plane must take into account the long range potential for holes along with the exchange interaction of spins .",
    "the simplest static hamiltonian for a square lattice of n sites is @xmath22 with @xmath23 the spin occupation number .",
    "the interactions are extended to distant neighbors , which are labeled by @xmath24 .",
    "the first term in ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) yields the repulsive interactions of ( spinless ) holes with coupling @xmath25 .",
    "the second term includes the crystal field contribution , with anisotropy parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 the last term considers the exchange interactions among spins ( @xmath28 ) , which in general are assumed to be anisotropic , with parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the spins are assumed to be classical variables and are constrained to lay on the plane .",
    "measurements taken in a considerable variety of layered compounds reveal that the inplane spin exchange interactions are isotropic to a high accuracy , meaning that the magnetic crystalline anisotropy dominates@xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath31 and adopt @xmath26 and @xmath32 as the source of anisotropy in our model .    to take the continuous limit of eq .",

    "two examples are shown in fig .",
