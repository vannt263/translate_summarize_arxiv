    "the dynamics of open quantum systems can be described in terms of completely positive ( cp ) , trace preserving maps acting on the system @xcite . in general these maps",
    "can rotate , compress and translate the bloch ball , resulting into ` affine ' maps @xcite .",
    "these maps are used to simulate different noises that could be acting on the system @xcite .",
    "a simple example of noise can be given by depolarizing maps , which result into shrinking of the bloch ball .",
    "in general the compression can be anisotropic , giving a rich geometric structure to the problem .",
    "the requirement of complete positivity turns out to be stronger than just positivity .",
    "for example , for n=2 the map corresponding to shrinking of the bloch sphere only along one direction and leaving the other two invariant ( pancake map ) is not cp . in n=2 case",
    "the general depolarizing map has a very simple structure and can be written as a convex sum of four fixed extremal maps .",
    "one would like to see if it true for higher dimensional systems .    in what follows",
    "we answer the question for n=3 and n=4 cases .",
    "we also give a way to answer the question for higher level systems , although we must admit that the calculations becomes much more involved .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe the geometry of n=2 level depolarizing channels . in sec .",
    "iii we show how to calculate the region of positivity for an n dimensional system .",
    "we carry out the calculations for n=3 and n=4 cases in sec .",
    "iv and v respectively .",
    "we conclude the paper with further discussions in sec . vi .",
    "the qubit density matrix is given by    @xmath3    positivity of @xmath4 requires that @xmath5 lies inside a sphere with unit radius .",
    "let s assume that due to depolarization , the sphere shrinks along the three polarization directions by factors of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the natural question arises - what are the allowed values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 to ensure complete positivity of the map ?",
    "it turns out @xcite that the allowed region in the space of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 forms a tetrahedron with vertices at ( 1,1,1 ) , ( 1,-1,-1 ) , ( -1,1,-1 ) and ( -1,-1,1 ) .",
    "these vertices correspond to four extremal maps given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the general depolarizing map can be written as a convex sum of these maps as @xmath12 where p , q , r are non - negative .",
    "only the region inside the tetrahedron is cp .",
    "for example , partial transpose corresponds to the point ( 1,-1,1 ) and lies outside the region .",
    "s is a tetrahedron with vertices corresponding to maps @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16,width=6 ]",
    "for an n level system the density matrix can be written in terms of @xmath17 traceless , hermitian and trace - orthogonal generators of su(n ) , denoted by @xmath18 , and the polarizations along those directions ( @xmath19 ) as @xmath20 this normalization results into pure states having unit length @xcite , analogous to the qubit case .",
    "let us assume that a general map acting on @xmath4 takes it into another density matrix given by @xmath21 .",
    "the map can be written in terms of the @xmath22 matrix@xcite as :    @xmath23    with change of indices , we can find another matrix b which is hermitian and has simpler conditions of complete positivity .",
    "it is obtained by @xmath24    complete positivity requires b to be positive semi - definite ( and thus have non - negative eigenvalues ) .      the simplest way to understand the depolarizing map is to think of it as compression of the coherence vector .",
    "let s assume that as the result of the map the polarizations are modified as @xmath25 which can be considered as a special case of @xmath26 for completeness we take t to be @xmath27 dimensional matrix acting on the vector ( 1,@xmath5 ) .",
    "needless to say , @xmath28 as required by the trace preserving condition .",
    "both the t and the a matrices contain all the information about the map and are thus related .",
    "the relation can be established in the following way .    since the super - matrix a acts on all the entries in @xmath4",
    ", we can convert @xmath4 into a vector ( let s call it @xmath29 ) which is acted upon by a. the entries in @xmath29 are linearly related to the coherence vector as @xmath30 the map takes @xmath29 to @xmath31 which is related to @xmath29 as @xmath32 thus @xmath33    once we get a and b we can find the eigenvalues of b and check for complete positivity .",
    "we solve the case of n=3 and n=4 in next two sections .",
    "the qutrit density matrix is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the gell - mann matrices    @xmath36    as shown in ( [ eq : diag ] ) , t can be written as @xmath37    m relates the density matrix to the coherence vector as :    @xmath38    explicitly :    @xmath39    calculation for @xmath40 yields :    @xmath41    the @xmath42 matrix is obtained by change of indices as    @xmath43    and is given by :    @xmath44    for the map to be positive , all the eigenvalues should be positive semi - definite .",
    "six of these eigenvalues are given by the ` hyperplanes ' :    @xmath45    the remaining three eigenvalues are given by the eigenvalues of @xmath46    since the matrix is hermitian and thus has real roots , the condition of positive eigenvalues translates to @xmath47 being positive .",
    "these can be easily found from the characteristic equation as    @xmath48    hence we see that the completely positive region is bounded by seven hyperplanes , a second degree surface @xmath49 and a third degree surface @xmath50 .",
    "this is quite different from the qubit case where the allowed region is bounded by four planes and is just a simplex with four vertices .",
    "for n=3 the depolarizing map has an infinite number of extremal points corresponding to the curved surface .",
    "from the previous section we might expect that the cp region will be a curved surface for n=4 , but quite analogous to the qubit case it turns out to be a simplex .",
    "let s start with taking the generators to be : @xmath51=\\{@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 } for i=1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "the density matrix is written as @xcite @xmath57    the m matrix is given by :    @xmath58    let s take the t matrix as in the previous case @xmath59    b matrix is given by    @xmath60    the eigenvalues of b are    @xmath61    since all of the eigenvalues are hyperplanes , cp region is a simplex . also , the vertices of this polyhedron correspond to the maps @xmath13 , @xmath62 , identical to the qubit maps .",
    "the extremal map - @xmath62 is just a rotation of the bloch ball about the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the general depolarizing map can be written as a convex sum of these sixteen extremal maps .",
    "we found that the general depolarizing map in n=2 and n=4 cases has a simple geometric structure , while for n=3 it is much more complicated .",
    "we conjecture that for any @xmath63 dimensional case the cp region will be a simplex , with vertices corresponding to a unitary rotation of the block ball",
    ". it would be interesting to explore the extent to which the n=2 and n=4 cases are similar for other maps .",
    "we would also like to point out that our method of calculating b , and thus finding out the region where a map is cp is general and is not restricted to depolarizing maps .",
    "the most general map ( affine map ) can be easily obtained if we let t also contain translations ( see @xcite ) . in that case",
    "t becomes @xmath64 where t contains only the unital part ."
