    "it has long been recognised that @xmath18-body studies of large - scale structure formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies produce dark - matter haloes whose density profiles are remarkably similar in shape over a wide range of halo virial mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this ` universal ' halo density distribution is characterised by a relatively shallow power - law behaviour in the inner parts , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 typically inferred at the smallest resolved radii , which steepens gradually to an extrapolated @xmath21 at arbitrarily large radii .    a physical explanation , based on first principles , for the origin of such a profile is still lacking , and there has been some considerable debate over the exact functional form implied by the numerical studies",
    ". the fitting function most commonly applied has the general form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the power - law slopes of the central cusp and in the limit @xmath25 , respectively , while @xmath26 is an appropriate scale radius .",
    "@xcite originally suggested the @xcite profile , corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while @xcite argued for @xmath27 but @xmath29 ( the so - called ` nfw ' profile ) .",
    "subsequently , several studies have argued for a somewhat steeper central cusp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with one recent suite of high - resolution simulations appearing to imply @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "however , even the highest - resolution simulation to date ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath31 ) can resolve the halo structure only to a fraction @xmath32 of its virial radius , and this for a single halo only .",
    "much more common are numerical resolution limits several times larger than that , leaving room for the possibility that halo densities might become _ shallower _ than @xmath33 at very small ( ` unobserved ' ) radii @xcite , and perhaps even tend to a finite density at @xmath34 with no cusp at all @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there might be no single , ` universal ' density slope in this limit @xcite . at the other extreme , there are very few hard constraints on any limiting value of the density slope as @xmath25 , as any halo is only well defined within a finite virial radius .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the question of dark - matter halo structure from a slightly different viewpoint , opting to derive @xmath35 from a simple dynamical _ ansatz _ , rather than fitting a pre - set family of functions to simulated density profiles .",
    "our starting point is still empirical , however , being based on another surprisingly uniform property of @xmath18-body haloes .",
    "as was first noted and exploited by @xcite , the ratio of the density @xmath35 and the cube of the velocity dispersion @xmath36 is a single power - law in radius @xmath37 over the full numerically resolved radial range . @xcite",
    "originally found @xmath38 , which interestingly is the value predicted by the classic similarity solution for spherical secondary infall @xcite .",
    "they then used this constraint to solve the jeans equation numerically ( assuming an isotropic velocity distribution ) for @xmath35 and @xmath36 separately .",
    "although their result for @xmath35 is not of the form ( [ eq : fitfunc ] ) ( it does tend to a shallow power law at the centre but steepens rapidly outwards and falls to zero at a finite radius ) , @xcite argued such a density distribution to be an adequate description of simulation data inside the virial radius .",
    "unfortunately , there is no exact analytical expression for @xmath35 in the case @xmath39 , and this approach has not been used for fitting any data .",
    "other studies have subsequently confirmed that @xmath40 is a power law in radius , but estimates of the exponent differ somewhat from the taylor - navarro value : @xmath41 or @xmath42 according to @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "our main aim is to investigate in more detail the structure and dynamics of spherical dark - matter haloes that follow a ` @xmath43-@xmath44 relation ' of the basic type given in equation ( [ eq : rhosig ] ) , allowing at least initially for arbitrary values of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig : rhosig ] we show this relation as defined by ten cdm haloes simulated by @xcite , the details of which were kindly provided to us by jrg  diemand .",
    "these include four galaxy - sized haloes and six cluster - sized haloes , with virial masses ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "all are dynamically relaxed .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhosig ] examine the ratio @xmath47 as a function of radius in these haloes , where the total one - dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath48 .",
    "the right panels look at the quantity @xmath49 vs.  @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the velocity dispersion in the radial direction only .",
    "power - law fits to each of these profiles are drawn , and the residuals from the fits are shown in the bottom panels .",
    "these demonstrate that the ratio @xmath49 follows a power law in radius _ at least _ as closely as @xmath47 does , although the fitted slopes differ slightly between the two cases .",
    "fits for each of the ten haloes individually yield power - law slopes that can differ by @xmath52 from the average values in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhosig ] . whether this scatter is real or simply a reflection of numerical uncertainties is unclear , but it is certainly rather modest .    to the extent that either of the @xmath43-@xmath44 relations illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : rhosig ] is ` universal ' , and insofar as dark - matter haloes are in equilibrium , imposing a dynamical constraint along the lines of equation ( [ eq : rhosig ] ) to solve the spherical jeans equation , as @xcite originally did , should lead directly to a ` universal ' density profile . while we have no physical argument for the fundamental origin of the precise power - law behaviour in figure [ fig : rhosig ] ( though clearly it must be related to the initial conditions and the formation via violent relaxation ) ,",
    "it is much simpler to characterise than the density profile itself .",
    "moreover , a jeans - equation approach allows explicitly for a simultaneous exploration of velocity anisotropy inside haloes  an issue which to date has been largely divorced from empirical descriptions of the halo density profiles .",
    "it is well known that the velocity distributions in dark - matter haloes are not isotropic .",
    "we characterise velocity anisotropy using binney s parameter @xmath53 such that @xmath54 corresponds to radial anisotropy and @xmath55 signifies a tangentially biased velocity distribution .",
    "it is typically found that @xmath56 ( isotropy ) at the centres of haloes and gradually increases outwards ( reflecting radial anisotropy ) , reaching levels of @xmath57 around the virial radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , it has been suggested @xcite that there exists a ` universal ' anisotropy profile in dark - matter haloes .",
    "very closely related to such an idea is the recent claim by @xcite , that @xmath58 depends roughly linearly on the logarithmic density gradient @xmath59 with essentially the same , constant slope @xmath60 holding for a variety of end - products of violent relaxation processes ( merger remnants , dark - matter haloes , collapse remnants ) .",
    "with these points particularly in mind , we base our analysis on the assumption that halo density and the _ radial _ component of velocity dispersion @xmath51 ( rather than @xmath61 ) are connected through a power - law relation of the general form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is any convenient reference radius , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . intuitively , as well as on the basis of figure [ fig : rhosig ]",
    ", it seems most natural to expect the exponent @xmath3 in this equation to be @xmath13 ; but it adds little complication to allow for the possibility @xcite that a slightly different value might provide a still more accurate description of simulated haloes . the choice of @xmath51 as the velocity dispersion to work with is arguably more natural than @xmath61 , since @xmath58 and @xmath51 appear separately in the spherical jeans equation but @xmath66 . technically , this choice ultimately allows for a more tractable inclusion of velocity anisotropy ; empirically , it is obviously well justified by figure [ fig : rhosig ] .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : isotropic ] with an investigation into which spherical density profiles satisfy the jeans equation and obey the _ ansatz _  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) under the restrictions of velocity isotropy ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) and a fixed @xmath13 .",
    "the problem is then identical to the one first considered by @xcite , and our approach is rooted in theirs , but we also draw on some aspects of the considerations by @xcite .",
    "however , unlike these authors , we explore the full solution space of the problem .",
    "we find that only very few of the many possible solutions correspond to realistic density models for simulated dark - matter haloes , and in fact only one solution , which occurs for a ` critical ' value of @xmath8 , is of practical importance .",
    "we then proceed in section  [ sec : aniso ] to consider the more realistic case of anisotropic velocity distributions and allow for general values of @xmath3 in equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "we show that in the case of an anisotropy parameter @xmath6 that depends linearly on @xmath12 ( including constant anisotropy as a special case ) , and for any @xmath3 , the solutions of the jeans equation under our adopted constraint are exact analogues of those in the @xmath67 , @xmath13 case . in particular , for each pair ( @xmath3 , @xmath69 ) only one physical solution of practical relevance exists , which again occurs at a ` critical ' @xmath8 value .",
    "these solutions have fully analytical density , mass , and velocity - dispersion profiles with power - law asymptotes at small and large radii .    in section  [ sec : simhalo ]",
    "we compare our analytical profiles to the ` observed ' density , velocity dispersion , and anisotropy profiles in haloes simulated by @xcite , finding good agreement in general .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] discusses our findings and summarises the paper .",
    "our underlying assumption is that some version of the general @xmath43-@xmath44 relation in equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) holds for dark - matter haloes . before allowing for this level of generality",
    ", however , there is much insight to be gained from beginning with a more specialised case , in which the velocity distribution is isotropic and @xmath13 .",
    "then , as in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we have @xmath70 the jeans equation for a spherical , self - gravitating collisionless system with isotropic velocity distribution is @xmath71 with @xmath72 . following @xcite , we solve equation ( [ eq : special ] ) for @xmath51 , insert it in equation  ( [ eq : jeans : a ] ) , and differentiate again to obtain @xmath73 = -\\kappa.\\ ] ] here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are dimensionless variables , and @xmath76 is a dimensionless measure of the velocity dispersion scale .",
    "@xcite studied the solutions of equation  ( [ eq : iso : a ] ) for the particular value @xmath77 by numerical integration .",
    "it proves useful , however , to first re - write the problem in terms of the ( negative ) logarithmic density slope @xmath78 , as defined in ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : iso : a ] ) then reads @xmath79 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath81    the objective of this section is to investigate the solution space of equation  ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) .",
    "first , note that its r.h.s .  becomes constant for @xmath82 , with @xmath83 in fact , as was already noted by @xcite , this singular density profile is a solution to equation  ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) and , for @xmath84 corresponds to the well - known singular isothermal sphere . for @xmath85 ( which covers our regime of interest",
    "; see figure [ fig : rhosig ] above ) , @xmath86 and thus , following @xcite , we choose to identify the reference radius @xmath63 in equation  ( [ eq : special ] ) as that at which the ( negative ) density slope equals @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 . in this way , @xmath63 is well - defined for all realistic solutions at more than just one radius . in this case",
    ", we pick that radius which in addition maximises @xmath89 . ] .",
    "moreover , it is then obvious from this equation that the constant @xmath90 is effectively a measure of @xmath89 at @xmath91 .",
    "let us now consider equation  ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) in some detail , in particular the possible behaviour of any solutions at very small and large radii ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that in the limit @xmath92 only three asymptotes are possible : either @xmath93 ( both sides of the equation vanish , so long as @xmath94 ) ; or @xmath95 ( both sides approach a constant ) ; or the density has a central hole with @xmath96 inside a non - zero radius ( note that @xmath97 is not possible , since the r.h.s .",
    "would then diverge for @xmath98 ) . in the limit @xmath99 , but misses the important possibility @xmath93 .",
    "] of these three , the latter is unrealistic , whereas @xmath95 is inconsistent with simulated haloes , which have shallower inner density slopes .",
    "this leaves @xmath93 as the only interesting option .",
    "we thus expect that , for any given value of @xmath8 , there exists one solution with @xmath93 as @xmath92 .",
    "the solution with this limiting behaviour is associated with a unique value of @xmath90 , which depends on @xmath8 through equation ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) .",
    "in fact , this very case corresponds to the ` critical @xmath90 ' solution developed by @xcite for their specified @xmath77 .    in the limit @xmath25 ,",
    "also only three possible asymptotes exist : either @xmath97 ( both sides of the equation vanish , if @xmath98 ) , or @xmath95 ( both sides approach a constant again ) , or the density has an outer truncation with @xmath96 beyond a finite radius ( note that @xmath93 is not possible , as the r.h.s .  then diverges if @xmath94 ) .",
    "all of these three are physically meaningful ( apart from the fact that for @xmath95 the mass formally diverges , similarly to the isothermal sphere ) .",
    "@xcite s ` critical @xmath90 ' solution for @xmath77 is one with an outer truncation .    in order to gain more insight into the solution space of equation  ( [ eq : iso : b ] )",
    ", we now follow @xcite and differentiate it yet again ( with respect to @xmath80 ) to obtain @xmath100\\big )     = \\tfrac{2}{9 } ( \\gamma-\\gamma_a)\\ , ( \\gamma-\\gamma_b)\\ , ( \\gamma-\\gamma_1),\\ ] ] equivalent to their equation  ( 2.2 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : flow ] , we plot flow diagrams of the @xmath101 phase space for three representative values of @xmath8 .",
    "the _ dashed _ parabola in each panel corresponds to @xmath102 while this actually is a solution to ( [ eq : iso : c ] ) , as already discovered by @xcite , it is not a valid solution to the original , physical problem .",
    "this is because the constant @xmath103 by definition , so equation ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) requires that @xmath104 in order for its r.h.s .  to be non - negative .",
    "in fact , the equality @xmath105 is only allowed in either of the limits @xmath93 as @xmath99 or @xmath97 as @xmath25 ( see the discussion above ) .",
    "similarly , any solutions below the parabola  ( [ eq : gamma : min ] ) require @xmath106 and are unphysical .",
    "by contrast , all solutions above the parabola  ( [ eq : gamma : min ] ) correspond to potentially viable solutions of the original equation ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) .    in all panels of figure [",
    "fig : flow ] , the flow vanishes at the three fixed points @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , which are plotted as _ blue _ dots .",
    "the central fixed point is stable and corresponds to the singular solution @xmath82 discussed above .",
    "solutions with @xmath110 ( arrows pointing upwards ) at any @xmath111 approach , in the limit @xmath112 , the upper right branch of the parabola @xmath105 .",
    "this corresponds to the case , discussed above , of an outer truncation to the density .",
    "more precisely , integrating equation ( [ eq : gamma : min ] ) twice yields the asymptotic density profile @xmath113 as @xmath50 approaches some finite radius @xmath114 . for @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "conversely , solutions with @xmath117 ( arrows pointing downwards ) at any @xmath118 approach , in the limit @xmath119 , the upper left branch of the parabola .",
    "this corresponds to the case , mentioned above , of an inner truncation , with the asymptotic density profile @xmath120 as @xmath50 approaches some radius @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "thus solutions for which @xmath112 at large radii have a finite outer truncation radius , and solutions for which @xmath119 at small radii have a finite - sized inner hole .",
    "these latter solutions are clearly unrealistic and also unphysical ( the isotropic distribution function must become negative to account for the hole ) .",
    "furthermore , solutions that ever visit @xmath124 are hardly realistic ( their density profiles become _ shallower _ towards larger radii , at least over some radial range ) .    apart from this  as @xcite have also noted  the generic behaviour of the solutions to equation ( [ eq : iso : c ] ) depends on whether @xmath8 is greater than , less than , or equal to a critical value @xmath125 for which the inner and outer fixed points @xmath126 and @xmath127 are equidistant from the central @xmath87 . referring to equations ( [ eq : gggab ] ) and ( [ eq : ggg1 ] )",
    ", @xmath128 requires @xmath129 .",
    "the behaviour of the solutions for @xmath130 is exemplified in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] .",
    "the solutions are split into two families by the one ( _ upper magenta _ ) which ends at the fixed point at @xmath131 , so that @xmath132 as @xmath25 .",
    "solutions lying above this curve correspond to density profiles with a central hole and an outer truncation ; those below usually also have a central hole but at larger radii perform damped ` oscillations ' about @xmath133 , eventually approaching @xmath134 as @xmath25 .",
    "all of these solutions are unrealistic , since they possess inner density holes .",
    "the only exception is a limiting solution ( _ lower magenta _ ) which starts from the fixed point at @xmath135 ( i.e. , @xmath136 as @xmath92 ) and slowly approaches @xmath133 as @xmath25 .",
    "however , this solution is still not a viable description of dark - matter haloes , since its density profile is too shallow at large radii .    the behaviour of the solutions when @xmath137 is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] for @xmath77 , the case previously studied by @xcite .",
    "the situation is in some sense a mirrored version of that for @xmath130 .",
    "the solution space is again divided into two families , now by the solution ( _ blue _ ) starting from the left fixed point at @xmath135 at @xmath34 .",
    "solutions above this one again correspond to density profiles with a central hole and an outer truncation ; those below it start from an ` oscillation ' about the power - law @xmath134 in the limit @xmath92 , eventually steepening outwards and generally being truncated at a finite large radius .",
    "the limit of this family is the solution ( _ magenta _ ) which instead of an outer truncation has a power - law fall - off with @xmath132 as @xmath25 .    for any @xmath137 ,",
    "the ( _ blue _ ) solution separating the two families just described _ is _ a potentially realistic model for dark - matter haloes , starting as it does from a shallow power - law cusp @xmath136 at @xmath92 ( with @xmath138 for @xmath139 ) and steepening outwards to reach @xmath140 at a finite radius .",
    "this is the model identified by @xcite as their ` critical @xmath90 ' solution in the specific case @xmath77 . given this @xmath8 , numerical integration of equation ( [ eq : iso : c ] ) outwards from @xmath141 at @xmath142 yields @xmath143 , to be compared with the value @xmath144 found by @xcite through trial - and - error integration of equation ( [ eq : iso : a ] ) starting from @xmath91 .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : flow ] depicts the special situation @xmath145 , for which the flow in @xmath101 phase - space is symmetric with respect to the transformation @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( because @xmath148 by definition of @xmath125 ) in this case , there exists a first integral , @xmath149 which is conserved by any solution of equation ( [ eq : iso : c ] ) with @xmath145 .",
    "in particular , @xmath150 for the solution @xmath151 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : gamma : min ] ] ) and also for @xmath152 which is plotted as the _ blue _ curve in the middle panel of figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "it again divides the solution space into two , although now solutions above the curve ( [ eq : iso : solution ] ) always have both an inner hole and an outer truncation to the density profile , while solutions below the curve undergo undamped ` oscillations ' about @xmath134 , never settling to an asymptote in either limit @xmath92 or @xmath25 .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : iso : solution ] ) for @xmath153 is particularly appealing since it starts from a shallow power law @xmath154 in the limit @xmath92 and tends to the steeper @xmath155 as @xmath25 .",
    "the combination of these features is reminiscent of dark - matter haloes .",
    "this single solution with @xmath145 is the _ only _ one , of all the solutions for any @xmath8 , whose density has both inner and outer power - law asymptotes and monotonically increasing @xmath12 .",
    "it is also the only one we have found which is simple enough that almost all its physical properties can be developed analytically : equation ( [ eq : iso : solution ] ) is easily integrated to give @xmath156 and subsequently @xmath157 as simple functions , which then allows us to evaluate @xmath158 , the enclosed mass profile @xmath159 , and the circular velocity @xmath160 .    to aid in obtaining these basic results , we first substitute equation ( [ eq : iso : solution ] ) into equation ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) and",
    "evaluate the result at @xmath161 ( where @xmath133 by definition ) to find    [ eq : iso : model ] @xmath162 ( for @xmath145 ) . with this in hand , we obtain @xmath163 where @xmath74 as usual .",
    "we have replaced @xmath164 with the total mass @xmath165 ; and the value of @xmath90 in equation ( [ eq : kappa : crit ] ) has been used with the basic definition ( [ eq : kappa ] ) to eliminate the normalisation @xmath166 from equation ( [ eq : iso : sigma ] ) .",
    "note that , because this solution has a finite total mass , both @xmath167 and @xmath168 fall off as @xmath33 in the limit @xmath25 . at the same time , both quantities vanish at @xmath34 , and thus each profile peaks at a finite radius .",
    "this happens at @xmath169 for @xmath167 , and at @xmath170 for @xmath168 .",
    "finally , the gravitational potential follows from integrating @xmath171 : @xmath172    where @xmath173 is the incomplete beta function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for an alternative form and asymptotic limits of @xmath174 , see equation  ( [ eq : aniso : pot : alt ] ) and the following text .",
    "apart from its convenient and unique analytical properties , this solution of the jeans equation is additionally of interest because it corresponds to a @xmath43-@xmath44 relation of the type in equation ( [ eq : special ] ) with @xmath175 , remarkably close to the exponent actually found for the simulated dark - matter haloes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhosig ] above .",
    "an obvious caveat is that our development in this section has assumed an isotropic velocity distribution , which is known to be incorrect .",
    "nevertheless , having characterised the solution space of equation ( [ eq : iso : a ] ) or ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) for this restricted case , it turns out to be straightforward to allow for realistic velocity anisotropies and at the same time investigate other values of @xmath3 in the full @xmath43-@xmath44 relation of equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "as we will now show , the specialised isotropic solution of equations ( [ eq : iso : model ] ) is in fact just one of a larger , more general family of analytical solutions to the jeans equation .",

    "that is , the structure of the jeans equation itself naturally suggests that we stipulate the relationship @xmath182 for @xmath183 and @xmath126 constants .",
    "the definition of @xmath126 follows from substituting the expression ( [ eq : beta : linear ] ) into equation ( [ eq : aniso : a ] ) , yielding @xmath184 if @xmath185 here @xmath186 and @xmath187 are defined as in section  [ sec : isotropic ] , while @xmath90 is given in equation  ( [ eq : kappa ] ) and @xmath188 equation  ( [ eq : aniso : b ] ) is thus the generalisation of equation  ( [ eq : iso : b ] ) for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath6 linearly dependent on @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 and @xmath189 , the two equations are identical ) .",

    "as long as @xmath193 to avoid fundamental changes in sign , the only differences between equations ( [ eq : aniso : c ] ) and ( [ eq : iso : c ] ) are in numerical values of constants including @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the topology of the @xmath101 phase - space for general @xmath194 with anisotropy parametrised as in ( [ eq : beta : linear ] ) is thus the same as for the isotropic case with @xmath13 , and mathematically the solution spaces of the two problems are isomorphic .",

    "these must suffice to describe the separate @xmath35 , @xmath167 , and @xmath58 profiles for a dark - matter halo . while it is of course possible to fit each of the ten simulated haloes individually , we are more interested here in the question of whether some ` universal ' parameter values might apply .    thus , we start by assuming that all haloes follow the same @xmath43-@xmath44 relation , @xmath271 , with a single value of @xmath3 . that this is likely",

    "we further assume that the central velocity anisotropy @xmath216 is the same for all haloes .",
    "this is more of a debatable contention  even though most simulations show similar ( low ) levels of anisotropy in their innermost resolved regions , there is no clear evidence that @xmath216 always tends to a single value .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath3 and @xmath216 both are ` universal ' then the shape of the density profile must be too in these models , and so this possibility is worth examining .",

    "the points joined by the _ solid blue _ curve denote the residuals from the fit of our model ; residuals from the others just listed are in the same line types and colours as in the upper panel .",

    "the main source of the slightly higher global scatter in our model vs.  the fitting function of @xcite is the single density point closest to the resolution limit of this simulation .",
    "it is noteworthy that our best - fit dynamical model is almost identical to the best - fitting @xcite function within the resolved radial range , as the latter has been shown to provide a very accurate description of many simulated dark - matter haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "at some level , it is not surprising that either of these curves is an improvement over , say , the nfw profile , since the former both involve three free parameters in @xmath35 ( recall that we fixed @xmath13 in fitting our model to this halo ) while the nfw function contains only two .",
    "the advantage to our model , of course , is that the extra degree of freedom in fitting the density profile is also used simultaneously to predict the _ anisotropic _ kinematics of the halo .",
    "for example , from equation ( [ eq : aniso : alpha : crit ] ) we would predict @xmath326 in the @xmath43-@xmath44 relation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) for this halo .",
    "perhaps coincidentally , this is almost exactly the @xmath327 found in figure [ fig : resids ] for the ten lower - resolution haloes from @xcite .",

    "as a rule , investigations into the structure of simulated dark - matter haloes have focused on the nearly universal shape of their density profiles .",
    "this approach is plagued , however , by the fact that the haloes are only ever resolved over 23 decades in radius .",
    "since the logarithmic density slope clearly varies smoothly over this entire range , in a way that is not anticipated from any first principles , it is then difficult to characterise unambiguously the true form of @xmath35 with necessarily ad hoc , empirical fitting functions . in particular , the value of the asymptotic central power - law slope ( if a single , universal asymptote even exists in the limit @xmath99 ) remains ill - constrained .",
    "thus , the starting point of our analysis in this paper was the remarkable , and much simpler , empirical fact ( @xcite @xcite , see also @xcite ) that simulated haloes satisfy , over their whole resolved range , a @xmath43-@xmath44 relation of the general form @xmath332 for @xmath51 the radial component of velocity dispersion , and @xmath333 .",
    "( as it happens , using the total one - dimensional velocity dispersion also leads to a nearly power - law @xmath43-@xmath44 relation , with a slightly different value for @xmath8 ; see @xcite , and figure [ fig : rhosig ] above . ) a single power - law dependence such as this is clearly easier to recognise , and to quantify accurately , than is a radius - dependent curvature in the density profile .",
    "it is also the simplest nontrivial form that any halo relation could take , and hence the @xmath43-@xmath44 scaling may be the most fundamental aspect of dark - matter haloes .    we should note here that , while @xmath40 has the dimension of phase - space density , its interpretation as phase - space density @xcite , coarse - grained or not , is problematic equal the _ average _ phase - space density at radius @xmath50 . however , there is no a priori reason why this situation should be satisfied in dark - matter haloes . ] . on the other hand however , if the phase - space density were in some sense of power - law form , we might expect @xmath40 to closely , but not exactly , follow a power law , too .",
    "our basic assumption has been that a power - law @xmath43-@xmath44 relation holds for all radii , not just those resolved by simulations .",
    "it is then possible to use this as a constraint on the spherical jeans equation in order to _ derive _ the density profile of an equilibrium halo . in section  [ sec : isotropic ]",
    "we did just this , for a specialised case with @xmath13 fixed and velocity isotropy assumed .",
    "this part of the analysis is thus similar to the original work of @xcite , and to aspects of @xcite  ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , our study has expanded considerably on these others , as we investigated the full space of all physical solutions to the isotropic jeans equation under a power - law @xmath43-@xmath44 relation with arbitrary exponent @xmath8 .",
    "most importantly , we have found that only one solution @xmath35 exists which asymptotes to realistic power - law behaviour in the limits of both small and large radii .",
    "this solution occurs only for a single critical value of @xmath8 and , for this one solution only , the density , velocity - dispersion , and enclosed - mass profiles are all fully analytic .    in section  [ sec : aniso ] we extended our analysis by allowing for arbitrary exponents @xmath3 in the @xmath43-@xmath44 relation and , unlike any other detailled study before , for velocity anisotropy .",
    "we found that the problem remains analytically tractable for any @xmath195 , only if we adopt a @xmath43-@xmath44 relation involving the _ radial _ component @xmath51 of velocity dispersion rather than the total ( empirically both are equally well motivated , see fig .  [ fig : rhosig ] ) _ and _ if we assume the anisotropy parameter @xmath334 to be either spatially constant or linearly dependent on the logarithmic density slope @xmath335 . under these reasonable assumptions",
    ", there always exists an exact analogue to the fully analytical density profile we found in the isotropic , @xmath13 case .",
    "this solution again occurs for a particular , ` critical ' @xmath8 value .",
    "moreover , for the realistic case of @xmath6 linearly increasing with @xmath12 ( corresponding to outwards ever more radially biased anisotropy ) , this is the _ only _ physical solution which resembles simulated dark - matter haloes .",
    "this result is gratifying for two reasons .",
    "first , it connects neatly with an entirely independent , empirical finding by @xcite , who have argued on the basis of a variety of simulations that indeed there exists a roughly linear relation between @xmath58 and @xmath78 in collisionless haloes formed through numerous different processes .",
    "second , it turns out that the _ slope _ of this linear ` @xmath6-@xmath12 relation ' does not affect the critical value of @xmath8 , nor does it affect the shape of the equilibrium @xmath35 profile itself .",
    "rather , both of these things are influenced only by the _",
    "anisotropy @xmath9 . specifically , for a @xmath43-@xmath44 relation with @xmath13 ( which ultimately does appear to be most appropriate ) , our solution of the jeans equation with radially varying velocity anisotropy requires    [ eq : e:3:models ] @xmath336 and has density @xmath337 with @xmath74 , radial velocity dispersion @xmath338 and anisotropy @xmath339    for any @xmath203 , @xmath340 .",
    "thus , the halo density profile has a shallow power - law cusp , @xmath341 in the limit @xmath99 , and steepens monotonically but slowly to @xmath342 as @xmath25 .",
    "more general results for @xmath343 in the @xmath43-@xmath44 relation , including analytical expressions for the velocity - dispersion , enclosed - mass , and circular - velocity profiles , are given in equations ( [ eq : aniso : model ] ) above ( with auxiliary definitions in eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : aniso : defs ] ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : simhalo ] we fit our analytical , critical-@xmath8 density and velocity - dispersion profiles to those in ten dark - matter haloes simulated by @xcite .",
    "when modelling these data , we assumed that all haloes obey a @xmath43-@xmath44 relation with a single value of @xmath3 _ and _ have the same central velocity anisotropy @xmath216 , so that the halo density profile is necessarily universal .",
    "we were able to find a good fit to all ten haloes simultaneously for @xmath13 and @xmath288 , only slightly different from isotropic ; see figure [ fig : simhalo ] . for this combination of parameters ,",
    "our model requires @xmath344 for self - consistency , and we showed in figure [ fig : resids ] that this is a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "in section  [ sec : simhalo ] we also fit our model to the density profile of an extremely high - resolution ( billion - particle ) halo simulated by @xcite , finding good agreement again with @xmath13 and a nearly isotropic @xmath325 . in this case",
    "the fitted density profile has a central power - law cusp @xmath345 as @xmath99 , which steepens gradually to @xmath346 as @xmath25 ; see figure [ fig : hires ] . at the resolution limit of the @xcite simulation ( about 0.001 of the virial radius ) , the fit has @xmath331 , significantly larger than the asymptotic cusp slope and still consistent with both the simulation data and the behaviour of other fitting functions . within the resolved radial range ,",
    "our model fit is also very closely traced by the best fit of the ad hoc profile proposed by @xcite .",
    "our findings suggest a possible first - principles explanation for halo density profiles along the following line of arguments .",
    "the initial distribution function before collapse was completely cold ( a @xmath347-function in velocity space ) and hence the phase - space density scale - free .",
    "the collapse and the subsequent process of violent relaxation ( phase - space mixing ) is driven by gravity alone , which can not introduce any scale dependence .",
    "this implies that the phase - space density of the collapsed halo satisfies some form of scale invariance , suggesting that the ratio @xmath348 , which is closely related to the phase - space density , follows a power law ( the general scale - invariant functional form ) .",
    "however , as our analysis has shown , if @xmath348 of dark - matter haloes is _ any _ power of radius , then the condition of equilibrium ( and physically sensible density profiles ) requires the _ particular _ power law @xmath349 and , simultaneously , that the density profile follows that given above .    from our fits to simulated haloes in section  [ sec : simhalo ] , the @xmath6-@xmath12 relation seems not as tight or universal as the @xmath43-@xmath44 relation .",
    "this is not very surprising , since different amounts of velocity anisotropy are required to stabilise different spatial halo shapes , resulting in some scatter between the @xmath6-@xmath12 relations of different haloes . since only the central velocity anisotropy @xmath216 affects the value of @xmath125 , this scatter has little ( or no ) influence on the the @xmath43-@xmath44 relation as long as @xmath216 is similar ( or the same ) for different haloes .",
    "this explains why haloes of different spatial shape still have very similar density profiles . whether @xmath216 is a universal parameter ( close to zero ) or whether there is some real scatter we can not predict , but in section  [ sec : simhalo ] we obtained a good fit to ten different simulated haloes using a single value for @xmath216 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simhalo ] ) .    of course",
    ", our analysis is still restricted to spherical symmetry and ignores any halo substructure . however , substructure is unimportant for the issue of the overall density profile , as simulations of dark - matter structure formation with suppressed small - scale power in the initial conditions still yield the same characteristic density profiles , but much less substructure @xcite .",
    "the issue of asphericity is more likely to be relevant and hence it is all the more remarkable that our spherical analysis gives such a good description of the spherically averaged profiles .",
    "evidently , anisotropy , which was ignored in previous studies , is presumably more important than asphericity , because the gravitational potential is always less aspherical than the density distribution .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jrg diemand for kindly and promptly providing us , in electronic form , with the density and kinematic radial profiles for simulated cdm haloes .",
