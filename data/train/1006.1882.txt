    "financial fluctuations have been a topic of study for economists @xcite , mathematicians @xcite , and physicists @xcite . here",
    "we study financial fluctuations using concepts developed in the field of seismology @xcite and analogies from turbulent dynamics in our description of market main shock magnitudes in order to analyze the dynamic response of markets to financial shocks .",
    "we identify parallels between energy cascades and information cascades , and also between turbulent bursts and the clustering of volatility @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate three statistical regularities which relate the volatility magnitude @xmath6 to the market response before and after market shocks .",
    "common financial  shocks \" are relatively smaller in the volatility magnitude , the duration , and the number of stocks affected , than the extremely large and infrequent financial crashes .",
    "devastating financial shocks such as black monday ( 20 october , 1987 ) have significant aftershocks that can last for several months , and this  dynamic relaxation \" is similar to the aftershock cascade following an earthquake @xcite . here",
    "we aim to better understand market shocks over a range of @xmath5 values .",
    "while the previous studies have focussed on at most a few large crashes , we use a large data set of 219 financial  main shocks \" observed in american markets over the 2-year period 2001 - 2002 .",
    "we analyze 531 frequently traded stocks corresponding to approximately 44,000,000 volatility records at a 1-minute time resolution .",
    "we find three quantitative relations which enable answering such questions as :    * how does the rate of volatility aftershocks decay with time , and how do the decay parameters relate to the main shock magnitude @xmath5 ? * how many aftershocks above a given threshold can be expected after a main shock of magnitude @xmath5 ? * what is the relation between the value of the main shock volatility @xmath1 and the second largest aftershock ( or preshock ) ?",
    "these three questions have been studied for geophysical earthquakes , and the corresponding statistical laws are referred to respectively as the omori law , the productivity law , and the bath law .",
    "the omori law was first investigated in the context of financial crashes by lillo and mantegna @xcite , who found a power - law relaxation of fluctuations at a 1-min time resolution for the s&p500 over the 100-day period following the black monday crash .",
    "power - law relaxation of aftershocks is also observed for long periods following several other medium - size crashes @xcite , and also for short periods up to several days following u.s .",
    "federal reserve interest rate change announcements @xcite .",
    "one key feature of long - range relaxation dynamics is the scale - free decay of large fluctuations that is typical of a system with memory , and which is complemented by self - similarity in the decay substructure @xcite .",
    "we find similar perturbation - response dynamics in the intraday volatility ( absolute return ) time series for many single stocks on numerous days , indicating that markets respond in a common way to perturbations that range in size from everyday market fluctuations to infrequent market crashes .",
    "interestingly , the market is very responsive to federal open market committee ( fomc ) news , either in the form of subtle hints from the fed or actual rate changes ( expected or unexpected ) , because fed target rates serve as a benchmark and barometer for both u.s . and world markets @xcite .",
    "methods have been developed to use the interplay between the u.s .",
    "treasury bill and the federal funds effective rate in order to estimate the future movement of the federal funds target rate @xcite .",
    "more complex methods to estimate the probability of interest - rate change involves analyzing the price - movement of expiring derivative contracts @xcite .",
    "the connection between macroeconomic factors and financial markets is a tribute to the complexity and connectivity of economic systems .",
    "it is a further indicator that news , in addition to complex order - book dynamics , can play a significant role in explaining the large rate of occurence of large fluctuations in markets .",
    "here we quantify the rate @xmath7 of volatility shocks at time @xmath8 both before and after a market shock occuring at time @xmath0 . in order to determine @xmath0",
    ", we develop a method for selecting a critical time @xmath0 from a set of candidate times @xmath9 for which the collective market volatility of @xmath10 individual stocks is above a given threshold . for 19 particular dates corresponding to days with fomc announcements ,",
    "we compare the values of calculated @xmath0 with the reported values of @xmath11 analyzed in @xcite , and we find good prediction of @xmath11 using this method .",
    "after this calibration , we study the relaxation dynamics of @xmath12 stocks , analyzing the omori law , the productivity law , and the bath law for the dynamics both before @xmath13 and after @xmath14 the main market shock .    in section [ section : data ]",
    "we discuss the data , the quantitative methods used to calculate @xmath7 , and define collective market movement . in section [ subsection : calibration ] we quantify the threshold for selecting candidate cascades and calibrate using known values of @xmath0 corresponding to fomc meetings .",

    "we note that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are independent of the dynamical model , and hence do not depend on @xmath7 , the functional form of the relaxation dynamics . for each of the statistical laws",
    ", we compare the results we obtain for the market average with the results we obtain for individual stocks .",

    "we then remove the  u \"- shaped intraday trading pattern ( averaged over 531 stocks ) from each time series .",
    "this establishes a normalized volatility in units of standard deviation for all minutes during the day and for all stocks analyzed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "since for earthquakes @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the scaling exponent in the gutenberg - richter law , this inequality establishes the relative importance of small fluctuations as compared to large fluctuations @xcite . in other words",
    ", this inequality indicates that small earthquakes play a larger role than large earthquakes in producing the observed number of large earthquake shocks . using an analogous argument for market volatility ,",
    "since the cumulative distribution exponent @xmath141 is found to be robust across many markets @xcite , then the total number @xmath183 of aftershocks triggered by all main shock of size @xmath138 scales as , @xmath184 is a decreasing function of @xmath138 .",
    "hence , we also find that aftershock cascade triggering is controlled by the contributions of the more numerous small shocks .",
    "thus , the medium - sized market shocks ( analyzed here ) play a larger role than the large market shocks in producing the observed heavy - tailed distribution of market shocks .",
    "we further note that the productivity is a combination of the relationships of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath1 , which can be written as @xmath185 with equivalent relation before the shock for @xmath171 .    in fig .",
    "[ aopba ] we plot the values @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath186 , both before and after the main shock at time @xmath0 .",
    "surprisingly , while there is little statistical relation between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , there is a strong relation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 as well as between @xmath171 and @xmath170 , for both @xmath187 and @xmath188 minutes .",
    "this result could be of interest for volatility traders and options traders who would like to anticipate the market dynamics _",
    "after _ an announcement , given the dynamics _ before _ the announcement .    in fig .",
    "[ bath ] we relate the size of the largest shock @xmath189 to the sizes of the second largest shock @xmath190 , both before and after @xmath0 .",
    "the bath law parameter @xmath18 quantifies the relation between @xmath191 and @xmath190 as @xmath192 this functional form implies the relation @xmath193 and hence @xmath194 .",
    "[ bath](c ) is a scatter plot of @xmath191 and @xmath195 which shows a linear relation corresponding to @xmath196 .",
    "surprisingly , fig .",
    "[ bath](a ) also shows a strong relation between @xmath191 and @xmath197 with @xmath198 . comparing the values of @xmath199 and @xmath200 ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath191 and @xmath190 is smaller after @xmath0 than before @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , both @xmath199 and @xmath200 are significantly smaller than the value @xmath201 observed for earthquake aftershocks @xcite , meaning that the largest preshock and aftershock are of comparable magnitude to the main shock .",
    "this significant difference between earthquakes and market shocks is largely due to the relative probabilities of observing first and second - largest events @xmath202 and @xmath203 . the conditional probability @xmath204 is given by the corresponding cumulative distribution function .",
    "hence , using eq .",
    "( [ cdfv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ cdfe ] ) , the ratio of the conditional probabilities for @xmath205 and @xmath191 is @xmath206 which roughly explains the @xmath207 factor difference @xmath208 .",
    "we also compare the volatilities @xmath191 and @xmath190 for individual stocks in fig .",

    "hence , the reaction to surpise causes larger volatility fluctuations than the anticipation of surprise .",
    "we further ask the question , how do the response parameters analyzed here depend on the variations between individual stock trading patterns ? to answer this question , we quantify the trading capacity of each stock by @xmath214 , the average number of transactions per minute , with @xmath215 for the @xmath20 stocks analyzed .",
    "we hypothesize that @xmath214 is closely related to firm size and market impact .",
    "fig.[poav](a ) shows that @xmath216 and @xmath217 increase with @xmath214 after @xmath0 , indicating that stocks with a large trading base respond to market shocks with large volatility @xmath218 ( shown in fig.[poav](b ) ) , but also relax more quickly , corresponding to larger @xmath16 values .",
    "however , we find no statistical relation between @xmath214 and @xmath219 .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ poav](b ) shows that this positive relation also applies to the dynamic response parameters before @xmath0 .",
    "cascading avalanche dynamics are a common phenomena in complex systems ranging in scale from solar flares @xcite and earthquakes @xcite to microscopic vortices in turbulent fluids @xcite .",
    "similar bursting phenomena is also observed in human organs , such as the heart @xcite , lungs @xcite , and brain @xcite , and also for common social @xcite and economic systems @xcite .",
    "neural avalanches in the brain are frequent even in the resting state , and are a signature of healthy brain functioning within the neural network . in fact , the ability to process and disseminate information is largely attributed to the network structure of neuronal correlations which , if inhibited by disease , lead to altered disfunctional states such as in the case of schizophrenia .",
    "extending by analogy , the frequency of cascades in financial markets could also be viewed as a `` healthy '' optimal state for processing information and eliminating arbitrage among the many the degrees of freedom .",
    "recent work @xcite on the switching dynamics around highs and lows in finanancial time series shows further evidence of omori power - law scaling before and after microtrend extrema , in analogy to the market shocks at @xmath0 developed here .",
    "interestingly , this work on switching dynamics finds cascading trends on time scales ranging from seconds to hundreds of days .",
    "financial markets are subject to constant information flow , resulting in a large rate of significant events , such as fed announcements @xcite , quarterly earnings , splits and dividends announcements , mergers and acquisitions , institutional reports .",
    "this information can arrive as  expected \" or come as a  surprise \" .",
    "interestingly , there are precursors extending more than a day in advance of expected announcements such as earnings announcements @xcite .",
    "economists have long been interested in the interplay between informed and uninformed traders , and the dissemination of information across a market consisting of rational agents .",
    "early work focusses on the relationship between trading volume and price change , and the relationship between these quantities and the qualitative notions of surprise , importance , and precision of the information @xcite .    using methods from statistical physics [ 4,5,34 ] and geophysics ,",
    "we analyze the absolute returns of price because of the long - memory property , and the universality of fluctuations in this quantity across diverse markets @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite postulates that price changes reflect the average change in market expectations , whereas trading volume reflects idiosyncratic reactions across all traders .",
    "recent work further quantifies trading volume fluctuations and finds that they are similar to price fluctuations , and furthermore , finds significant cross - correlation between volume change and price change @xcite .",
    "omori relaxation dynamics are also shown for trading volume in @xcite .",
    "here we also observe significant volume cascading as evident in fig .",
    "the analysis of volume and transaction dynamics is an avenue of future research , and could highlight the relationship between volume and price fluctuations by studying their correlation around market shocks .",
    "to summarize , we analyzed the cascade dynamics of price volatility , which has potential applications in options pricing and the pricing of other derivatives .",
    "the black - scholes equation in its simple form assumes that the fluctuations in the price are constant during the duration of the option @xcite .",
    "however , more sophisticated methods @xcite incorporate time dependent price volatility , and are more realistic descriptions of the non - stationarity of financial time series .",
    "the results in this paper are of potential interest for traders modeling derivatives on short time scales around expected market shocks , e.g earnings reports .",
    "the statistical regularity of both market and individual stock behavior before and after a market shock of magnitude @xmath220 provides information that could be used in hedging , since we observe a crossover in the cascade dynamics for @xmath221 .",
    "knowledge of the omori response dynamics provides a time window over which aftershocks can be expected .",
    "similarly , the productivity law provides a more quantitative value for the number of aftershocks to expect .",
    "finally , the bath law provides conditional expectation of the largest aftershock and even the largest preshock , given the size of the main shock .",
    "of particular importance , from the inequality of the productivity law scaling exponents and the pdf scaling exponent for price volatility , we find that the role of small fluctuations is larger than the role of extremely large fluctuations in accounting for the prevalence of aftershocks .                                p. weber , f. wang , i. vodenska - chitkushev , s. havlin , and h. e. stanley , relation between volatility correlations in financial markets and omori processes occuring on all scales .",
