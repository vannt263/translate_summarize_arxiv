    "high-@xmath1 particle suppression in nucleus  nucleus ( aa ) with respect to pp collisions is regarded as one of the major discoveries at rhic .",
    "the effect can be quantified with the nuclear modification factor : @xmath2 which , at high @xmath1 , would be equal to unity if the aa collision was a mere superposition of @xmath3 independent nn collisions . in central au ",
    "au collisions at centre - of - mass energy @xmath4 per nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) pair the phenix and star experiments have measured @xmath5 at high @xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) and central pseudorapidity ( @xmath7 )  @xcite . the observed suppression is explained in terms of hard - parton energy loss ( quenching ) due to gluon radiation induced by the dense qcd medium expected to be formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . as the effect depends on the medium properties , and on its density in particular ,",
    "hard partons can be used as probes to perform tomographic studies of the medium itself .",
    "charm and beauty quarks are qualitatively different probes with respect to light partons , since the ` dead - cone effect ' is expected to reduce the in - medium gluon radiation off massive partons  @xcite . at the lhc ,",
    "more than 100 @xmath8 pairs are expected to be produced per central  collision at @xmath9 and the detectors will be equipped with high position - resolution tracking systems , specifically designed for heavy - flavour detection .",
    "therefore , it will be important to carry out a comparative study of the quenching of massless and massive probes in order to ( a ) test the consistency of the interpretation of the effect as due to energy loss in a deconfined medium and ( b ) further investigate the properties ( density ) of such a medium .",
    "we calculate in - medium parton energy loss in the framework of the ` bdmps ' ( baier - dokshitzer - mueller - peign - schiff ) formalism , reviewed in  @xcite . in a simplified picture ,",
    "a parton produced in a hard collision undergoes , along its path in the medium , multiple scatterings in a brownian - like motion with mean free path @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the gluons in the parton wave function pick up transverse momentum @xmath11 with respect to its direction and they may eventually decohere and be radiated",
    ".    the scale of the energy loss is set by the characteristic energy of the radiated gluons , @xmath12 , which depends on the in - medium path length @xmath13 of the parton and on the bdmps transport coefficient of the medium , @xmath14 .",
    "the transport coefficient is defined as the average medium - induced transverse momentum squared transferred to the parton per unit path length , @xmath15  @xcite . in the case of a static medium , the distribution of the energy @xmath16 of the radiated gluons ( for @xmath17 ) is of the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the qcd coupling factor ( casimir factor ) , equal to 4/3 for quark ",
    "gluon coupling and to 3 for gluon  gluon coupling . in the case of infinite parton energy , @xmath20 ,",
    "the integral of the radiated - gluon energy distribution up to @xmath21 estimates the average energy loss of the parton : @xmath22 the average energy loss is : proportional to @xmath19 and , thus , larger by a factor @xmath23 for gluons than for quarks ; proportional to the transport coefficient of the medium ; proportional to @xmath24 ; independent of the parton initial energy @xmath25 .",
    "however , when the realistic case of finite parton energies is considered , the energy loss @xmath26 has to be constrained to be smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , this effectively results in reducing the difference between quark and gluon average energy losses and in changing the @xmath13 dependence from quadratic to approximately linear .",
    "moreover , since a consistent theoretical treatment of the finite - energy constraint is at present lacking in the bdmps framework , approximations have to be adopted , thus introducing uncertainties in the results  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks with moderate energy , i.e. @xmath27 , propagate with a velocity @xmath28 significantly smaller than the velocity of light , @xmath29 . as a consequence , in the vacuum",
    ", gluon radiation at angles @xmath30 smaller than the ratio of their mass to their energy @xmath31 is suppressed by destructive interference  @xcite . the relatively depopulated cone around the heavy - quark direction with @xmath32",
    "is called ` dead cone ' . in  @xcite it",
    "is argued that the dead - cone effect should characterize also in - medium gluon radiation and it is approximated by means of a suppression factor that multiplies the energy distribution of the radiated gluons ( [ eq : wdidw ] ) : @xmath33^{-2}=    \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{m}{e}\\right)^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega^3}{\\hat{q}}}\\right]^{-2 }    \\equiv f_{\\rm h / l}\\,,\\ ] ] where the expression for the characteristic gluon emission angle  @xcite @xmath34 has been used .",
    "the heavy - to - light suppression factor @xmath35 in ( [ eq : fhl ] ) increases ( less suppression ) as the heavy - quark energy @xmath25 increases ( the mass becomes negligible ) and it decreases at large @xmath16 , indicating that the high - energy part of the gluon radiation spectrum is drastically suppressed by the dead - cone effect .    a recent detailed calculation of the radiated - gluon energy distribution @xmath36 in the case of massive partons  @xcite confirms the qualitative feature of lower energy loss for heavy quarks ,",
    "although the effect is found to be quantitatively smaller than that derived with the dead - cone approximation of  @xcite .",

    "the comparison of our results with @xmath78 and @xmath107 suggests that the c - quark mass may not reduce significantly the suppression , in contrast to what expected from the dead - cone effect .",
    "this is due to ( a ) the fact that the dead - cone effect resulting from the full massive calculation is indeed quite small for charm quarks and ( b ) the fact that , within this model , the medium is found to be very opaque , already at rhic energies , and only partons produced nearby the surface can escape .",
    "note , however , that the results have a significant uncertainty , because a rigorous theoretical treatment of the finite parton energies is still lacking in all parton energy loss calculations .",
