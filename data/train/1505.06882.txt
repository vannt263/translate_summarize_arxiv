    "in wireless communication systems , interference is an inherent phenomenon . due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels",
    ", interference arises whenever multiple transmitter - receiver pairs are active concurrently in the same frequency band , and each receiver is only interested in retrieving information from its own transmitter . for a particular receiver , the received signal is a superposition of its desired signal , interfering signals and background noise .",
    "sinr , defined as the power of desired signal divided by the sum of the power of interfering signals and the power of noise , is a widely used performance measure for wireless communication systems .",
    "it is analogous to signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) used for single user communication , which has clearly understood implication on the bit error rate ( ber ) and capacity for additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels . using sinr as a surrogate for ber and",
    "capacity implicitly assumes that the interference is an awgn .",
    "although there are limitations of this assumption , as reported in @xcite , the importance of sinr has never been doubted .    for",
    "a system consisting of multiple point - to - point communication sessions , also referred to as _ unicast system _ , the sinrs of all receivers form a vector .",
    "the feasible sinr region includes all the sinr vectors that can be achieved by some transmission powers .",
    "the geometric properties of feasible sinr region has been studied in @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite proves that in the case of unlimited transmission power , the feasible sinr region is log - convex . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that under a total power constraint , the infeasible sinr region is not convex .",
    "reference @xcite considers a system with only three transmitter - receiver pairs without power constraint , and shows that the feasible sinr region is concave .",
    "it also provides certain technical conditions under which a concavity result for systems with a general number of users is established . in @xcite , for the cases that the transmission powers are subject to arbitrary linear constraints , a mathematical expression for the boundary points of the sinr region is obtained .    in this paper , we consider the feasible sinr region for systems consisting of multiple point - to - multipoint communication sessions , also referred to as _",
    "multicast system_. multicast enables data to be delivered from a source node to multiple destination nodes .",
    "practical examples of such configurations include cellular networks and two - way relay networks . in cellular networks ,",
    "a base station multicasts a file to multiple mobile devices that request the file at the same time @xcite . in two - way relay networks ,",
    "when network coding is applied , a relay multicasts the coded packets to two sink nodes @xcite .",
    "the power control and scheduling for wireless multicast systems have been studied in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "all these works aim to either minimize the system power or maximize the system throughput , subject to the constraint that the sinr of all receivers are larger than a given threshold .",
    "the feasibilities of the problems , however , are unknown .    for a wireless unicast system ,",
    "the feasibility of an sinr vector without power constraint is determined by the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of a nonnegative matrix @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this result to a wireless multicast system .",
    "we first propose a necessary and sufficient condition under which an sinr is achievable without power limitation . based on this condition",
    ", we figure out the feasible sinr region by giving its boundary points . the approach is to find the farthest point of the feasible sinr region from the origin in a given direction .",
    "an iterative algorithm is proposed to find the farthest point , which is also a distributed power control algorithm to solve the power balancing problem @xcite aimed to maximize the minimal sinr of all receivers .",
    "then we analyse the geometric properties of the feasible and infeasible sinr regions .",
    "it is found that the feasible sinr region of a multicast system is in fact the intersection of the feasible sinr regions of all its embedded unicast systems .",
    "based on the results in @xcite for unicast systems , we show that the feasible sinr region of a multicast system is log - convex , and the infeasible sinr region of a multicast system with two multicast sessions is convex .",
    "we also show by an example that , the convexity property of the infeasible sinr region does not hold for a general multicast system with more than two multicast sessions .",
    "later , the necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of an sinr in a multicast system is extended to include linear constraints on the power .",
    "this result generalizes the results in @xcite for unicast systems . besides",
    ", in @xcite , the zero - outage sinr region for a time - varying system is also considered , where the channel gains are selected from a finite set .",
    "suppose the transmission powers are not allowed to vary with the channel gains , we establish a reduction that maps any instance of the zero - outage sinr problem in a time - varying unicast system to a corresponding instance of the feasible sinr problem in a time - invariant multicast system .",
    "the idea is to regard the multiple receivers in a multicast session as an identical receiver that can experience a finite set of channel gains .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section : system ] , the system model and problem formulation are presented .",
