    "the @xmath0 decay ( see @xcite for a recent review ) is a flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process and therefore highly sensitive to new physics ( np ) effects .",

    "the mfv hypothesis amounts to the assumption that the sm yukawa couplings be , also in extensions of the sm , the only structures responsible for flavor ( and cp ) violation . in models with mfv , np contributions to fcnc processes are thus suppressed by the same ckm factors as in the sm and therefore expected to be naturally small .    in the context of the mssm",

    "the coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 lead to flavor non - diagonal terms in the down squark mass matrix , which in turn imply the existence of gluino contributions to fcnc processes like @xmath0 that , however , are proportional to the respective ckm matrix elements .    in previous phenomenological studies of the mfv mssm adopting the general definition  @xcite , it was found that np contributions to many observables are small @xcite .",

    "we then fix @xmath66gev and show br@xmath62 vs. @xmath60 , still not including gluino contributions . in that case",
    ", one finds that for large values of @xmath60 , chargino contributions are not large enough anymore to cancel the higgs contributions and thus , large values for @xmath60 seem disfavored if the charged higgs is light .",
    "however , once gluino contributions are included , also for large @xmath60 cancellations are again possible ( see right plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : plots ] ) .",
    "in fact , we find that cancellations among higgs , chargino and gluino contributions can occur throughout the parameter space and no absolute lower bound can be placed on any of the relevant susy masses .",
    "the general mfv ansatz for the soft susy breaking terms leads to gluino contributions to fcncs .",
    "these gluino contributions can be sizeable in @xmath0 for large values of @xmath1 , due to a large flavor conserving right - left mass insertion , followed by a flavor changing left - left insertion .",
    "as it then turns out , the different contributions in the mfv mssm - namely higgs , chargino and gluino contributions - are naturally competitive and cancellation patterns among them are not difficult to achieve . in particular , we find that although the @xmath0 decay acts as a severe constraint , it is nonetheless impossible to obtain model - independent bounds on susy masses from this decay alone .",
