    "the structure of the inner galaxy still remains to be revealed . while recent infrared surveys have led to discoveries of new features in the bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the distribution of young stars , say younger than 1  gyr , restricted to within a degree of the galactic plane is still elusive .",
    "in addition to the strong foreground extinction towards the inner galaxy , the high density of older stars in the bulge makes it difficult to trace the younger component(s ) .",
    "it is therefore required to focus on some prominent tracers whose ages are easily deduced .",
    "for example , the nuclear stellar disk ( hereinafter nsd ) has been long known to host massive stellar clusters whose ages are several myr ( figer , mclean & morris @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this stellar disk extends @xmath0400  pc around sgr  a@xmath1 and co - exists with the massive reservoir of interstellar matter known as the central molecular zone ( launhardt , zylka & mezger @xcite ) .",
    "this region also hosts current star formation and young stellar objects spread across the nsd @xcite .",
    "classical cepheids are also useful tracers of young stellar populations .",
    "they are pulsating supergiants with the famous period  luminosity relation ( plr ) which enables us to estimate their distances reasonably well .",
    "they are evolved from intermediate - mass stars , 3.511  m@xmath2 , and their period  age relation allows us to trace stellar populations aged 10300  myr @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered three classical cepheids in the nsd .",
    "the three cepheids have similar periods , @xmath020  days , which indicated that they are around 25  myr old .",
    "@xcite , in addition to reporting another cepheid with very similar characteristics , provided further support for the membership of the four cepheids to the nsd based on radial velocities from near - ir high - resolution spectra .",
    "@xcite recently reported dozens of new cepheids found in the vvv survey ( vista variables in the va lctea survey , @xcite ) .",
    "their new cepheids are located towards the bulge region and more spread than the nsd , and @xcite concluded that they are in the inner part of the disk , within a few kpc around sgr  a@xmath3 .",
    "radio observations , however , do not support such ubiquitous distribution of young objects in the inner part of the disk .",
    "recent deep radio observations have discovered two kinds of objects that trace star formation activities in the inner galaxy : h@xmath4 regions detected in recombination line and radio continuum emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and maser spots in high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath5 absorption seen in the radio continuum of the former makes it possible to estimate locations of the h@xmath4 regions , while very long baseline interferometer observations of the latter , if conditions allow , enable one to obtain trigonometric distances . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "no h@xmath4 regions have been identified within 4  kpc around sgr  a@xmath1 except in the nsd , while at the edge of this void exist the expanding 3  kpc arms @xcite with which h@xmath4 regions are associated .    in this paper , we report classical cepheids newly discovered in our near - ir survey and discuss their distribution . in particular , we discuss the large effect of the extinction law .",
    "the ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath6 is important , in our discussions , for estimating the extinction in @xmath7 from the reddening in @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath9 based on their photometric data for red clump towards the bulge , while @xcite combined the 2mass @xmath7 magnitudes of red clump stars with the 2mass colours of red giant stars in the same areas to obtain @xmath10 .",
    "this difference leads to estimates of extinction differing by @xmath010  % ; a smaller @xmath6 value would result in a larger estimate of distance .",
    "objects towards the galactic centre have large reddenings , 1.52.0  mag in @xmath11 , thus leading to a large difference in distance moduli , 0.30.4  mag , which corresponds to 1.01.5  kpc at the distance of @xmath08.0  kpc .",
    "@xcite adopted the @xmath6 value from @xcite after a transformation into their vvv photometric system , while adopting the smaller value from @xcite would put their cepheids further than they estimated as we discuss below in more detail .",
    "our observations were conducted using the irsf 1.4  m telescope and the sirius camera ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which collects images in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath7 bands , simultaneously .",
    "these observations are thus on the same colour system as those of @xcite .",
    "the observed field is composed of 142 fields - of - view of irsf / sirius , covering @xmath02.3  deg@xmath14 , between @xmath15 and @xmath16 in galactic longitude along the galactic plane , i.e.  @xmath17 in galactic latitude .",
    "observations at about 30 epochs were made between 2007 and 2012 .",
    "the basic data analysis was done in the same manner as in @xcite . in short ,",
    "point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry was performed on every image using the iraf / daophot package , and variable stars were searched for by considering the standard deviations of time - series photometric data .",
    "the variability search was done using the three - band datasets independently , so that we could find variables even if they are visible only in one of the @xmath18 bands . in addition",
    ", we included the variable stars in @xcite which are within the fields of this survey even if their variations are slightly smaller than the detection limits of variability .",
    "this survey is slightly shallower than that of @xcite , and as a result many objects are too faint to be detected in @xmath12 band .",
    "the saturation limits are 9.0 , 9.0 and 8.5  mag in @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath7 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection limits vary across the survey region depending on the crowding .",
    "for example , the detection limits are 15.2 , 14.9 , and 14.1  mag for relatively sparse regions , @xmath19 , while for crowded regions , @xmath20 , they get shallower , 15.0 , 14.1 , 13.0  mag in @xmath18 . the definition of these limits is described in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use only @xmath13- and @xmath7-band magnitudes for estimating distances to cepheids as done by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the plr of classical cepheids from @xcite , @xmath21 these relations were calibrated based on _ hubble space telescope _ parallaxes of cepheids in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "these plrs and the extinction coefficient of @xmath22 @xcite are combined with observed magnitudes , @xmath13 and @xmath7 , to estimate the distance modulus @xmath23 and the foreground extinction @xmath24 .",
    "we detected approximately 100 variable stars with period between 0.1 and 60  d , among which we identified 29 classical cepheids ( table  [ tab : catalogue ] ) .",
    "we did not always detect the variables in all of the @xmath18 bands ; table  [ tab : catalogue ] includes @xmath25flag which we also used in @xcite to show the reasons of non - detection or the qualities of the listed magnitudes .",
    "all the objects we report here were detected in both @xmath13 and @xmath7 bands , while roughly half of them were too faint in the @xmath12 band .",
    "table  [ tab : catalogue ] also lists @xmath24 and @xmath23 derived with @xmath13- and @xmath7-band mean magnitudes .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     the differences in the distance moduli , @xmath26 , can be attributed to three reasons : measured magnitudes , the plrs , and the extinction law ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdiff ] ) .",
    "first , magnitudes of classical cepheids in tables  [ tab : catalogue ] and [ tab : match ] show significant scatter , @xmath00.1  mag in @xmath13 and @xmath00.05  mag in @xmath7 when compared with each other .",
    "this introduces a systematic offset of 0.04  mag in distance moduli with a standard deviation of 0.08  mag , which is illustrated by the ( b ) points in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdiff ] . while the differences in the photometric results produce the scatter of @xmath26 , the systematic offset caused by this is not large .",
    "the second cause of @xmath26 is the difference in the plrs adopted .",
    "@xcite used plrs by @xcite after the conversion of that photometric system to vista and the re - calibration of their zero points based on the distance to the lmc , 18.493  mag in @xmath27 , obtained by @xcite .",
    "their plrs are slightly different from the ones we adopted ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : phr ] and [ eq : pkr ] ) .",
    "this leads to different estimates of distance modulus by 0.070.1  mag depending on @xmath28 of a cepheid but independent of reddening ; the plrs by @xcite give smaller estimates of distance .",
    "as indicated by the ( c ) points in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdiff ] , this increases the systematic offset of @xmath26 to 0.17  mag .",
    "finally , the difference in the extinction coefficients adopted is the largest cause of the systematic offset . with @xmath11 values of 12  mag given , the difference of 0.17 in @xmath6 between @xcite and @xcite introduces offsets of 0.20.4  mag . combining this with other offsets mentioned above",
    ", we can explain the large systematic offsets , @xmath29  mag .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath01.7  kpc at the distance of 8  kpc .    .",
    "in case of ( a ) , our photometric data were used with our plr ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : phr ] and [ eq : pkr ] ) and the extinction law of @xcite , which is our default analysis , and thus the offsets are zero .",
    "dkny s photometric data were used in case of ( b ) . in case of ( c ) , furthermore , the plr by @xcite were used .",
    "the extinction law was further changed to the n09 for ( d ) .",
    "grey thick line shows average offsets for the four cases .",
    "[ fig : dmdiff ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : ed_hk ] illustrates the effect of @xmath6 on distances of cepheids in this paper and those reported in @xcite .",
    "the red curves in the upper panel corresponds to the results of four cepheids ( nos .",
    "1013 in table  [ tab : catalogue ] ) which we consider belong to the nsd .",
    "the horizontal line and shaded region indicate the recent estimate , @xmath30  kpc , of the galactic centre distance @xcite . the comparison between the distances of the four cepheids and that of the galactic centre supports the coefficient of @xmath22 or even smaller",
    ". the larger coefficient @xmath31 would lead to significantly smaller distances of the four cepheids , @xmath32  kpc , which is rather unexpected as the distance to the nsd that is rotating around the galactic centre .",
    "the membership of these four cepheids in the nsd seems secure .",
    "this is based on : ( 1 ) their positions , ( 2 ) their closely similar distances ( independent of the adopted reddening law ) , ( 3 ) their closely similar periods ( indicating an unusual period distribution and a significant increase in star formation @xmath025  myr ago ) , and ( 4 ) their radial velocities which are consistent with orbits expected in the nsd . full details of these aspects are given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should use the smaller @xmath33 at least for the four cepheids towards the inner part of the bulge .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite estimated @xmath6 towards a small region around the galactic centre to be 1.301.35 , even smaller than our value , which could put the average distance of the four nsd cepheids closer to 8.0  kpc .    .",
    "the upper panel ( a ) is concerned with our cepheids , while the lower panel ( b ) with those in @xcite .",
    "the vertical lines mark the coefficients from @xcite .",
    "the horizontal line and grey area indicate the range of recent estimates of the galactic centre distance , @xmath34  kpc .",
    "four cepheids which are considered to be within the nuclear stellar disk , having @xmath35  kpc with @xmath33 , are indicated by red curves .",
    "[ fig : ed_hk ] ]    how about other cepheids distributed between @xmath36  degrees in galactic longitude ? the extinction law may be spatially variant .",
    "@xcite , for example , suggested a variation of @xmath00.1 in @xmath6 towards different corners of the inner bulge , within 2.5  degrees around the galactic centre ( also see gosling , bandyopadhyay & blundell @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , concerning the spatial variation of the near - ir extinction law ) .",
    "if there were such variation , this would be the largest source of uncertainty in distances of the cepheids discussed here .",
    "nonetheless , if other cepheids had similar distances to the four cepheids at @xmath08  kpc , all of them should have large @xmath6 values , 1.7 or more , which would be distinctly large compared to the value for the nsd objects .",
    "this is unlikely for the following reason .",
    "several previous papers traced the shape of the galactic bar using red clump distributed across a similar range of galactic longitude , @xmath37 @xcite . using a given extinction coefficient for the entire range of each study",
    ", the inclination of the bar appears as a smooth change of the peak distance of the red clump .",
    "if the @xmath6 towards the central region were significantly different from other lines - of - sight , the bar structure in the above studies should have presented the effect of the systematic change instead of the smooth inclination .",
    "therefore , we conclude that all the cepheids in this study and @xcite are further than the four cepheids in the nsd .",
    "in the following discussion , we use @xmath22 for all of our cepheids .",
    "in addition , we re - calculated the distances of the cepheids reported by @xcite in the same way as for our cepheids using the plrs of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phr ] ) and ( [ eq : pkr ] ) and the extinction law by @xcite . the distances and extinctions obtained",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dakrangecc ] .",
    "the four cepheids at around 8  kpc show a concentration to the value expected for objects in the galactic centre , while other objects show a wide range of @xmath38 values at @xmath39  kpc .",
    "the cepheids from @xcite are now largely located behind the bulge .",
    "the revision of their distances does not change their distances from the galactic plane so much , and they are within 50  pc of the plane except one , object  5 in @xcite , being at @xmath0100  pc above the plane .",
    "their locations are thus consistent with the thin disk behind the bulge .    from the magnitude range of our survey ( section [ sec : observation ] ) and the expected absolute magnitude , we can predict the range of @xmath38 in which we can detect cepheids .",
    "we here consider detections in both @xmath13 and @xmath7 , which are the most important bands in this study .",
    "drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : dakrangecc ] are boundaries which correspond to the detection limits ( dashed curves ) and the saturation limits ( solid curves ) in the @xmath38 plane . for each of the detection limits and the saturation limits ,",
    "three curves are drawn for cepheids with different periods , i.e.  different absolute magnitudes .",
    "a cepheid should have @xmath23 and @xmath24 which fall in between the corresponding dashed and solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : dakrangecc ] in order to be detected in our survey . with @xmath40 ,",
    "for example , cepheids with @xmath41 are around the detection limit at the distance of @xmath08  kpc , while those with @xmath42 can be detected at a significantly larger distance .",
    "it is therefore possible to detect longer - period cepheids within several kpc , both on the nearer and on the further side , around the galactic centre unless the extinction gets significantly larger .",
    "the lack of our detection of such cepheids indicates the absence of cepheids in the corresponding region .     and",
    "@xmath24 of detected cepheids are plotted  filled circles for our objects and open circles for those in @xcite .",
    "note that the reddening law by @xcite was used for both sample in this plot .",
    "also presented is the range of the @xmath38 space in which classical cepheids could be detected in both @xmath13- and @xmath7-band images in our survey .",
    "solid and dashed curves indicate saturation and fainter limits , for each of which , curves corresponding to three different periods of cepheids , i.e.  different absolute magnitudes , are drawn .",
    "three - dimensional extinction map by @xcite , @xmath24 increasing as a function of distance , is illustrated by the thick dotted curve and the shaded area ; the former indicates the median curve of @xmath24 values along the lines - of - sight towards 142 irsf / sirius fields - of - view in our survey and the latter shows the range of 90 percentile at each distance .",
    "[ fig : dakrangecc ] ]    we found no classical cepheids significantly closer than the four in the galactic centre although there seems to be room in the parameter space in which cepheids could have been detected in our survey .",
    "the three - dimensional extinction map by @xcite suggests that the extinction remains smaller than 0.5  mag in @xmath24 up to @xmath03.5  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dakrangecc ] ) .",
    "with such an extinction at the smaller distance , even short - period cepheids must have been saturated .",
    "no such cepheids , if any , in our survey field have been reported in previous variability catalogues ( ddo database of galactic classical cepheids , @xcite ; general catalogue of variable stars , @xcite ; aavso international variable star index , watson , henden & price @xcite ) .    in the range of 3.56",
    "kpc in distance , some cepheids could have been detected in our survey depending on the period and the foreground extinction .",
    "this range corresponds to the galactocentric distance of 24.5  kpc with the galactic centre distance assumed to be 8  kpc , thus in the vicinity of the 3  kpc arm and closer to the centre .",
    "our survey field , @xmath02.3  deg@xmath14 , covers 0.04  kpc@xmath43 in this distance range along the galactic mid - plane .",
    "the ddo database @xcite lists 71 cepheids within 2  kpc around the sun and within 50  pc of the galactic plane , which gives a volume density of 110  kpc@xmath44 .",
    "assuming the density gets higher towards the inner region following an exponential law with a scale length of 3.5  kpc ( see windmark , lindegren & hobbs @xcite ) , the density in the above volume would be higher by a factor of @xmath03 , thus leading to @xmath0350  kpc@xmath44 .",
    "this suggests that about 14 cepheids could be included within our survey field at 3.56  kpc , although we found none .    in order to take the completeness of our survey into account",
    ", we made a monte - carlo simulation as follows .",
    "first , we generate 5000 cepheids uniformly distributed within our survey volume between 3.56  kpc .",
    "then , we assign their periods randomly but following the period distribution of the ddo database cepheids in the solar neighbourhood ( see fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "with the plrs ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : phr ] and [ eq : pkr ] ) and the extinction from the map by @xcite for each simulated cepheid , we can calculate its expected magnitudes in @xmath13 and @xmath7 and determine whether it would be detected in our survey or not .",
    "the simulation suggests that @xmath070 percents of cepheids located in this volume should have been detected .",
    "considering the space density mentioned above , we could have detected about 10 cepheids in our survey with the assumed space distribution .",
    "the absence of such cepheids indicates that the density of cepheids in the inner part of the disk , except the nsd , is lower than expected by the simple exponential law",
    ". the volume density in the inner part may be even smaller than that in the solar neighbourhood with which @xmath03 cepheids are expected to be found in our survey .",
    "[ fig : xyscc ] plots the distribution of our cepheids and dkny s sample by filled and open circles . locations of the ddo database cepheids are indicated by grey points ( e.g.   see majaess , turner & lane , @xcite , for discussions on their distribution ) . here , again",
    ", the distances of the dkny s objects are obtained based on our adopted plr and the extinction law of @xcite . except the four cepheids belonging to the nsd ,",
    "none of our cepheids , indicated by filled circles , are within 2.5  kpc around the galactic centre indicated by the cross .",
    "therefore , we found no evidence of the disk - like distribution of young stars in the inner part of the galaxy suggested by @xcite , except the nsd .        towards the bulge but in regions of higher galactic latitude , @xmath45 , @xcite reported 32 classical cepheids found in the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of these cepheids are similar to those of type ii cepheids in the bulge ( fig .  7 in @xcite ) , and thus ,",
    "if these are indeed classical cepheids , they are expected to be significantly further than the bulge .",
    "five of them are confirmed to be classical cepheids located in the flared part of the disk by @xcite , while accurate distances and natures of the others are not well determined .",
    "the five cepheids in @xcite are located outside the range of figure  [ fig : xyscc ] , at heliocentric distances of 22  kpc or larger .",
    "their distances from the galactic plane , @xmath46  kpc , are also distinctly larger than the cepheids plotted in figure  [ fig : xyscc ] .    among the cepheids reported by dkny s et  al .",
    ", four stars ( their 11 , 13 , 20 , and 22 ) are relatively close to the galactic centre , 12  kpc .",
    "unfortunately , none of them are within our survey field .",
    "their exact locations and kinematics are of great interest to study stellar populations of the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , as we discussed in section  [ sec : lackofceps ] , we found no cepheids closer than the four immediately around the galactic centre .",
    "in addition , there seems to be a space , at the galactic distance of 2.55  kpc , without any cepheids on the nearer side of the galactic centre in contrast to the further side where dozens cepheids were found ( @xcite and this work ) .",
    "our survey only partly covers this relatively close range ( 35.5  kpc from the sun ) due to the saturation limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dakrangecc ] ) .",
    "previous surveys may also have been incomplete in this region since our survey and that of @xcite have found cepheids at the corresponding galactocentric distance on the opposite side of the centre .",
    "deeper and more comprehensive surveys in the optical , such as _ gaia _ , or shallower surveys in the infrared will have the capability to provide a more complete mapping of variable star populations .",
    "the presence of an inner thin disk , represented by cepheids , which was suggested by @xcite has not been confirmed .",
    "the lack of cepheids in the inner part of the galaxy , a few kilo - parsecs both on the front- and far - side of the galactic centre , suggests that the young stellar populations do not follow the exponential disk distribution towards the centre .",
    "a similar lack in the inner disk has been also found in the distribution of h@xmath4 regions .",
    "our study demonstrated that the extinction law has a strong impact on investigations of the distribution of obscured stars in the inner galaxy .",
    "it is nonetheless clear that the recent infrared surveys are revealing populations of cepheids in a large area of the galaxy , including the opposite side of the disk beyond the bulge .",
    "detailed observations of these objects , such as high - resolution spectroscopy for radial velocities and metallicities , would provide a new path to a global picture of galactic structure and evolution .",

    "<S> recent large - scale infrared surveys have been revealing stellar populations in the inner galaxy seen through strong interstellar extinction in the disk . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> classical cepheids with their period  luminosity and period  age relations are useful tracers of galactic structure and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> interesting groups of cepheids reported recently include four cepheids in the nuclear stellar disk ( nsd ) , about 200  pc around the galactic centre , found by matsunaga et  al . and those spread across the inner part of the disk reported by dkny and collaborators . </S>",
    "<S> we here report our discovery of nearly thirty classical cepheids towards the bulge region , some of which are common with dkny et  al . , and discuss the large impact of the reddening correction on distance estimates for these objects . assuming that the four cepheids in the nsd are located at the distance of the galactic centre and that the near - infrared extinction law , i.e.   wavelength dependency of the interstellar extinction , is not systematically different between the nsd and other bulge lines - of - sight , most of the other cepheids presented here are located significantly further than the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a lack of cepheids in the inner 2.5  kpc region of the galactic disk except the nsd . </S>",
    "<S> recent radio observations show a similar distribution of star - forming regions .    </S>",
