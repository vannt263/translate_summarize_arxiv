    "while the topic of quasar research started in the beginning of the twentieth century @xcite , it took nearly ninety years to built up a coherent , unifying model for radio - quiet agn @xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with mass ranging from 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 is surrounded by an accretion disc and its associated corona , who radiate a continuum spectra from the soft x - ray energy to the near - infrared waveband .",
    "broad line signatures are thought to arise from high velocity gas trapped close to the equatorial plane between the accretion disc and a surrounding , optically thick , circumnuclear dust medium .",
    "this `` dusty torus '' is thought to collimate ejection winds along the polar direction , where narrow line features are expected to be produced by distant , low velocity outflows .",
    "according to the unified scheme , many of the agn observational characteristics can be explained by an inclination effect rather than intrinsic composition differences .",
    "however , the exact morphology of the inner agn regions remains highly debated due to a wide panel of observational emission and absorption line features .",
    "if cylinder - like , spinning , equatorial reprocessing regions where initially used to model the broadening of the emission lines in seyfert-1 objects ( see @xcite for a review ) , it is now admitted that the morphology of the broad line region is by far more complex ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this picture , the central , ionising source is surrounded by a roughly spherical distribution of clumps in keplerian motion , situated at the outermost areas of the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "similar assumptions about the clumpy nature of the narrow line regions @xcite increase the difficulty of the challenging but necessary goal of drawing a unifying model for the sub - parsec regions of quasars .    in this context",
    ", @xcite developed a phenomenologically - based model to explain the wide variety of emission and absorption features in agn spectra , assuming a simple outflowing structure . the model presented by @xcite assumes a flow of warm , highly ionised matter ( whim ) that is launched from an accretion disc over a small range of radii and then bent outward and driven into a radial direction by radiation pressure ( see fig . 1 and @xcite ) .",
    "certain aspects of this phenomenologically - derived structure can be directly tested from number counts of type-1 and type-2 agn or the relative number of broad absorption line ( bal ) versus narrow absorption line ( nal ) objects .",
    "the wind structure surrounds the irradiating accretion disc and gives rise to a reprocessing spectrum that varies with the disc luminosity and the viewing angle of the observer .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy therefore is a powerful tool to test the model against the observations , but this technique may not be sufficiently sensitive to the outflow geometry and dynamics .    to extend the comparison of the outflow model to the observations somewhat further , spectropolarimetric data of agn can be explored . in the optical / uv band ,",
    "the polarisation of radio - quiet agn is mostly determined by reprocessing and strongly depends on the scattering geometry .",
    "we expect bal objects to be generally more highly polarized than non - bal qsos @xcite and nal seyfert - like galaxies to show polarisation parallel to the axis of the torus associated with polarisation degrees inferior to unity @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of nearby seyfert galaxies showed that there is an observational dichotomy between type-1 and type-2 agn : a large fraction of agn seen by the pole ( type-1 ) show a polarisation position angle oriented parallel to the system axis , while edge - on objects ( type-2 ) exhibit a perpendicular polarisation position angle @xcite .",
    "when a polarisation model is provided , one of its goals is to reproduce the observed dichotomy , where parallel polarisation is thought to originate close to the smbh , while perpendicular polarisation emerges from the circumnuclear matter or the ionised winds ( see references and modelling in @xcite ) .",
    "hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) polarization imaging of ngc  1068 and markarian  477 showed that perpendicular polarisation can also emerge from scattering clumps situated 10 to 100 pc away from the innermost regions @xcite ; in these cases , the necessity to reproduce type-2 perpendicular polarisation is less critical .",
    "however , the production of parallel polarisation in type-1 agn is a rather important challenge , as it might give us an insight of the intrinsic spectral shape of the central engine .",
    "the detection of a balmer absorption edge in a few quasars @xcite , thought to originates interior to the blr , strengthens the role of parallel polarisation as a tool to constrain the geometry and the composition of reprocessing and scattering media close to the smbh @xcite .",
    "this continues to be very relevant in agn research where geometry is a key parameter for unification theories @xcite .    in the present work , we model the polarisation properties produced by radiative reprocessing inside the structure of quasars as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we focus on the continuum polarisation at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths and we test if the outflow model can reproduce the observed dichotomy with respect to the polarisation position angle @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] we present and analyse spectropolarimetric simulations of disc - born outflows for different model parameters . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we discuss our results and relate them to the observational constraints before drawing our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "to study the model of @xcite , we apply the version 1.2 of monte carlo radiative transfer code stokes presented in @xcite and upgraded by @xcite .",
    "this modelling suite coherently treats three - dimensional transfer and multiple reprocessing between emitting and scattering regions and includes a treatment of polarisation .",
    "the model space is surrounded by a spherical web of virtual detectors .",
    "the detectors record the wavelength , intensity and polarisation state of each photon .",
    "the latest - to - date version of stokes also generates polarisation images with the photons being projected onto the observer s plane of the sky and then stored in planar coordinates .",
    "the net intensity , polarisation degree @xmath9 and polarisation position angle @xmath10 as a function of wavelength are then computed by summing up the stokes vectors of all detected photons in a given spectral and spatial bin .",
    "the spectra can be evaluated at each viewing direction in the polar and azimuthal direction @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "note that a position angle @xmath13 denotes a polarisation state with the @xmath14-vector oscillating in a perpendicular direction with respect to the symmetry axis of the wind , while for @xmath15 the @xmath14-vector is parallel to the ( projected ) wind axis .",
    "we simulate the radiative transfer through the structure for quasars as proposed by @xcite by constructing continuous outflow regions that can be filled with electrons or dust or a combination of the two at uniform density . assuming a uniform density certainly is an oversimplification and we are going to release this condition in future work . for now , we only perform the most basic polarisation test of the wind model . for all models presented in this paper , the equatorial emitting region",
    "will be defined as an isotropic , disc - like source emitting an unpolarised spectrum with a power - law spectral energy distribution @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the model geometry is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig1.1 ] : the wind arises from the accretion disc at a distance r@xmath18 of 0.0032  pc ( 10@xmath19 cm ) and is bent into a direction of @xmath1 = 60@xmath2 relative to the model symmetry axis .",
    "the range of radii where the flow arises from the accretion disc is parametrised by r@xmath20 = 0.00032  pc ( 10@xmath21 cm ) .",
    "finally , the half - opening angle @xmath22 of the wind is 3@xmath2 and the flow extends up to r@xmath23 = 0.032  pc ( 10@xmath24 cm ) .",
    "it is instructive to express these distances in units of the gravitational radius ( @xmath25 ) for a fiducial black hole mass of @xmath26 10@xmath27  m@xmath8 ( such as in ngc  5548 ) , as well as in units of the dust sublimation radius ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 = 1500  k , @xcite ) and blr radius ( @xmath30 , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimated @xmath28 and @xmath30 from ngc  5548 s near - ir reverberation measurements and reverberation mapping of h@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "converted radii , given in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , imply that the phenomenological outflow derived by @xcite arises below the dust formation radius and the blr is likely to form closely beyond the inner part of the wind .",
    "the extension of the wind covers a large fraction of the blr , essentially obscuring the highly ionized clouds close to the central engine .",
    "we assume that the whim is mainly composed of ionised gas with a thomson optical depth @xmath5 of the order of unity along the conical outflowing direction .",
    "this wind extends out to several parsec and can be associated with the `` ionisation cones '' observed in nearby seyfert-2 galaxies @xcite . to investigate the scattering properties and the resulting spectra and polarisation from the whim , we first consider a uniform - density , continuous medium made of electrons .",
    "the thomson optical depth at the wind base and inside the conical , outflowing direction are set to @xmath32  0.02 ( @xmath33 = 3@xmath3410@xmath27 ) and @xmath35  2 ( @xmath33 = 2.6@xmath3410@xmath6 ) , respectively . such an optical depth is in agreement with observational measurements @xcite and also suggested by polarisation modelling work on ngc  1068 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1.2 ] , we plot the simulated spectropolarimetric results across the 2000  8000    wave band and as a function of the observer s viewing angle .",
    "we consider three different lines - of - sight : one along a polar inclination ( 9@xmath2 ) , one passing through the outflowing wind ( 61@xmath2 ) , and one along an extreme equatorial inclination ( 89@xmath2 ) .",
    "the inclination of the system is defined with respect to the symmetry axis of the model .",
    "the polar and equatorial lines of sight do not cross the extended wind and the fraction @xmath36 of the central flux , @xmath37 , remains similar for both inclinations . at intermediate inclinations , however , a significant fraction of the radiation is scattered out of the line - of - sight by the optically thick wind . the polarisation percentage at all three viewing directions is wavelength - independent , as it is expected for thomson scattering , and the polarisation position angle is @xmath15 ( parallel polarisation ) for all cases .",
    "the polarisation percentage @xmath9 is very low at polar viewing angles and then rises with @xmath11 .",
    "it increases to 0.05  % when looking through the extended wind and then further to about 0.3  % for an edge - on line - of - sight .",
    "the corresponding polarisation images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1.3 ] .",
    "the 60  @xmath34  60 spatial bins compile the polarisation properties integrated across the whole wave band of 2000  8000   .",
    "each pixel is labelled by its projected coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( in parsecs ) with respect to the centre of the model space . the polarised flux @xmath40 is colour - coded and the orientation and length of a vector drawn in black at the centre of each pixel represent the @xmath10 and @xmath9 values , respectively .",
    "the degree of polarisation is maximal for a full - length vector ( size of a spatial bin ) ; the length variation is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "inspection of the polarisation images is helpful to understand the net polarisation properties as a function of the viewing angle : at a polar viewing direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig1.3 ] , top ) , the central source irradiates the outflow funnel , which causes a weak polarised flux in the vicinity of the model centre .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of polarisation position angles remains close to being symmetric with respect to the centre and therefore the resulting net polarisation at a low viewing angle is weak .",
    "furthermore , the polarisation is strongly diminished by the diluting flux coming from the continuum source that is directly visible at low inclinations . the resulting polarisation position angle at @xmath41",
    "is determined by the geometry as the wind is rather flat ( @xmath1 = 60@xmath2 ) and therefore favours scattering close to the equatorial plane .",
    "equatorial scattering produces parallel polarisation and was suggested early - on to play an important role in producing the polarisation properties of type-1 agn @xcite .    at @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1.3 ] , middle ) the line - of - sight passes through the extended winds .",
    "the net polarised flux now comprises a strong component seen in transmission .",
    "while the wind base is optically thin , the scattering optical depth along the line - of - sight is significant and the latter thus contributes strongly to the net polarisation .",
    "the interface between the inner funnel of the torus and the extended winds is traced by a sharp gradient in polarised flux .",
    "the inner ( outer ) surfaces of the upper ( lower ) part of the outflow are visible in reflection , but due to their low optical depth in the poloidal direction the scattering is inefficient and does not produce much polarised flux .    finally , the equatorial view of the model at @xmath43 ( fig .  [ fig1.3],bottom ) allows us to recover the edge - on morphology of the system .",
    "the polarised flux emerging from the wind base and its extensions is significantly higher than at the intermediate view .",
    "the boundaries of the extended winds trace out an x - shaped structure that extends far out and produces strong polarisation .",
    "these regions have a higher polarisation efficiency because they present a significant optical depth along the line of sight and favour a scattering angle around @xmath44 with respect to the continuum source .    the polarisation position angle",
    "@xmath10 is equal to 90@xmath2 for all viewing angles , indicating that the polarisation angle is oriented parallel to the symmetry axis of the system .",
    "+ we remark that adopting the exact geometry suggested in @xcite for a pure electron - scattering medium underestimates the observed optical polarisation percentage of type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "the wavelength - independent continuum polarisation induced by the whim produces a polarisation position angle @xmath15 at all viewing angles , whereas in type-2 agn the resulting polarisation should be perpendicular .",
    "it is then necessary to look at more realisations of the model for slightly different parametrisations .",
    "we continue our investigation by exploring different angles @xmath1 and @xmath22 of the wind . to obtain a more narrow cone with respect to the default parametrisation used in sect .",
    "[ sect2.1.1 ] , it is necessary to lower the bending angle @xmath1 while the wind extensions become thicker when increasing the half - opening angle @xmath22 .",
    "we systematically explore the response in polarisation for a range of both angles and summarise the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2.1 ] .",
    "since the polarisation of electron scattering is wavelength - independent we now plot the wavelength - integrated polarisation degree as a function of the viewing angle .",
    "note that we apply a sign convention for @xmath9 that expresses the orientation of the polarisation position angle : for positive @xmath9 , the @xmath14-vector is perpendicular to the wind axis , while for negative @xmath9 the polarisation is parallel ( intermediate orientations of the net polarisation are impossible due to symmetry reasons ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5.3 ] , at high optical depths of the dust , the scenarios of fig .",
    "[ fig5.4 ] have similar polarimetric properties to the multi - component torus models investigated in @xcite .",
    "the polarisation dichotomy is reproduced but the polarisation degree at type-2 inclinations is higher than observed @xmath9 levels @xcite . decreasing the dust optical depth ( @xmath45 = 4 ) diminishes the overall @xmath9 as photons can now escape from the dusty funnel by transmission through the dust wind .",
    "the polarisation dichotomy is preserved down to @xmath45 approximatively equals unity , where the multiple regimes for parallel and perpendicular polarisation reappear .",
    "however , they leave a higher covering factor for the observed number density of type-2 agn and the resulting polarisation degree at equatorial viewing angles is lower and thus closer to the observed range .",
    "our modelling excludes optically thin dust environments ( @xmath46 1 ) as they automatically generate parallel photon polarisation angles at equatorial inclinations .",
    "the impact of the model morphology is essentially visible at intermediate and equatorial viewing angles , where the observer s line - of - sight is crossing the dust material . for type-1 objects ,",
    "the polarisation degree is found to be parallel , with @xmath47 2  % , slightly increasing with @xmath11 . around 45@xmath2 , @xmath9 remains stable for a few @xmath11 , depending on the half - opening angle of the outflow .",
    "such a polarisation plateau ( @xmath48 3  5  % ) associated with a perpendicular polarisation position angle is a strong observational prediction that could help to estimate the average @xmath22 of bal - quasars is found to be of the order of a few percents , associated with a perpendicular polarisation position angle for 4 out of 6 objects . ] . for higher inclinations",
    ", @xmath9 rises as backscattered photons from the whim funnel strongly contributes to the polarisation flux .",
    "when the internal structure becomes hidden by the cold , outer dust layer , @xmath9 starts to decrease until it reaches a minimal value along type-2 inclinations ( below 10  % at @xmath49 4 ) .",
    "+ we thus find that for @xmath50 , and @xmath51@xmath52 , and moderate optical depths of the dust with @xmath4 , the double - wind model seems to rather well reproduce the observed continuum polarisation .",
    "it gives strong observational predictions on the geometrical opening angles of the outflow , as well as the amount of cold dust that can survive so close from the emitting source .",
    "however , it is important to investigate if the physical and geometrical changes to the model of @xcite proposed are realistic and in agreement with number counts of different agn types .",
    "we tested to which extend the whim model of @xcite can reproduce the observed polarisation dichotomy with respect to the polarisation position angle , as well as the expected level of polarisation percentage in type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "a pure thomson scattering model with @xmath1 = 60@xmath2 and @xmath22 = 3@xmath2 presents low @xmath9 levels ( @xmath53 1  % ) and can not reproduce the perpendicular polarisation expected at equatorial inclinations . for low - luminosity objects , @xcite predicts that the amount of polarisation along the outflow s direction , where a layer of dust prevents the detection of bal , would be below 0.5  % .",
    "our modelling agrees with this claim but adding dust to the outer parts of the conical outflows still does not produce the expected polarisation dichotomy .",
    "finally , a double - layered wind also solely produces parallel polarisation , as well as too high polarisation percentages at type-2 viewing angles .",
    "exploring different sets of morphological and opacity parameters , we then found that small modifications help to match the modelling results with polarisation observations .",
    "a key point is to slightly lower the bending angle of the winds ( @xmath54 ) to allow for the presence of perpendicular polarisation at type-2 viewing directions .",
    "perpendicular polarisation at intermediate and equatorial lines - of - sight emerges naturally when photons travel through geometrically thick regions with an optical depth equal or larger than unity .    for the pure whim model we found parametrisations that may correspond to the observed polarisation dichotomy between non - nal / nal ( type-1 ) agn and obscured balqso s or seyfert-2 galaxies",
    "however , the solid angle of the sky covered by seyfert-2 galaxies may require additional dust obscuration that we also tested .",
    "both , the observed polarisation dichotomy and polarisation degrees can be reproduced if we consider a dual wind model with @xmath1 = 45@xmath2 and include equatorial scattering in the accretion flow .",
    "the half - opening angle @xmath22 of the flow then normalises the polarisation degree as well as the maximum inclination at which parallel polarisation is still detected .",
    "the opacity of the outer ( dusty ) wind may also be adjusted to decrease the polarisation degree at equatorial inclinations ; the maximum polarised flux is then observed along the outflowing direction . to match with spectropolarimetric observations ,",
    "the dust optical depth along the equator should be close to unity .",
    "the question of discriminating between different wind models was raised by @xcite discussing wind properties for the x - ray range .",
    "we here add a brief discussion about the uv / optical properties of the ionisation cones and narrow line regions seen in seyfert-2 like galaxies .",
    "the first conical models were based upon the geometrical shape of the extended narrow line regions that are supposed to be the natural extension of the ionised outflows .",
    "the assumed morphology is an hourglass - shaped , bi - conical region with the emitting source situated at the cone base .",
    "the resulting polarisation rises from face - on towards edge - on viewing angles and uniquely produces perpendicular polarisation angles , independently of the filling medium ( either electrons or dust grains , @xcite ) .",
    "typically , @xmath9 can be as high as 20  % for ionised or dusty winds .",
    "however , the wind structure of @xcite presents a very different polarisation pattern : in contrast to polar outflows , the hollow winds can produce polarisation at parallel and perpendicular position angles .",
    "compared with the model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5.3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5.4 ] , the polarisation degree is small ( @xmath47  5  % ) at both polar and equatorial viewing angles .",
    "the maximum polarisation degree is reached for lines - of - sight crossing the outflow , with 5 @xmath55 25  % , depending on the model s dust opacity and half - opening angle .",
    "the two - phase model succeeds to reproduce the polarisation degree expected from the polarised continuum of bal quasars @xcite .",
    "the low - luminosity version of the wind with dusty extensions leads to @xmath560.5  % as predicted for non - bal objects @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite s two - phase model may produce a polarisation position angle that varies from 90@xmath2 at pole - on views to 0@xmath2 at equatorial views , which is in agreement with the observed polarisation dichotomy .",
    "depending on the parametrisation , it is also possible to create @xmath10 = 0@xmath2 photons at polar inclinations  a phenomenon observed in some seyfert-1 galaxies that were named _ polar scattering dominated _ agn by @xcite .",
    "compared to the modelling results for agn winds , the observed polarisation degrees are generally found to be significantly lower . in the atlas of seyfert-2 galaxies presented by @xcite ,",
    "a large polarisation degree was detected for mrk  463e ( @xmath9 = 10.29 @xmath57 0.18  % after starlight correction , @xmath58 = 0.050 @xcite ) , but finding such highly polarised type-2 agn is quite uncommon .",
    "the majority of the observed seyfert-2 galaxies show lower @xmath9 values , usually below 3  % @xcite .",
    "most seyfert-1 galaxies have much weaker polarisation degrees , usually below 1  % @xcite , except for exceptional , high - polarisation objects where @xmath9 can reach up to 5  % ( see mrk  231 in @xcite and fairall  51 in @xcite ) .",
    "the diversity of detected polarisation degrees is difficult assess in the modelling .",
    "simulations of simple and isolated @xcite , or complex and radiatively coupled @xcite reprocessing regions in agn tend to create too large polarisation degrees at equatorial viewing angles and not enough polarisation at polar inclinations .",
    "the outflow model evaluated in this paper seems to be able to overcome these difficulties when taking into account a two - phase wind structure .",
    "high polarisation degrees at a perpendicular polarisation position angle can be reached if the inclination of the system is close to the bending angle of the quasar wind ; low @xmath9 values are produced when the observer s line - of - sight is close to the equatorial plane .",
    "as the proposed set of outflow half - opening angles lies between 3@xmath2 and 10@xmath2 , the ratio of high-@xmath9 to low-@xmath9 agn remains small , which is coherent with the few high-@xmath9 seyfert-2 galaxies detected so far .",
    "as for seyfert-1 galaxies , the structure is able to produce parallel polarisation as high as 2  % ( fig .  [ fig5.3 ] ) , while preserving the observational evidence of higher @xmath9 values for equatorial viewing angles than at polar inclinations ( fig .",

    "according to @xcite , perpendicular polarisation indicates that polar electron scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "however , @xcite s estimation of the inclination towards ngc  5548 ( @xmath11 = 47.3@xmath2",
    "@xmath60 ) implies that the polarisation degree should be significantly higher than the observed value .",
    "our model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5.1 ] can explain the polarisation degree and the polarisation position angle of ngc  5548 in the context of the wind model for a bending angle of 45@xmath2 .",
    "it strengthens the idea that agn winds do not need to be fully filled by reprocessing matter ; a hollow geometry may be then considered as more likely .",
    "located in the southern hemisphere , ic  5063 ( @xmath58 = 0.011 , @xcite ) is a seyfert - galaxy that is famous to be the first agn where a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen was detected @xcite . among other characteristics , its _ hubble space telescope _",
    "image shows an ionised structure extending out to 15  kpc in a remarkable , x - shaped morphology @xcite .",
    "however , spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric images of solid double cone models @xcite show that the scattering region re - emits uniformly to the irradiation source and the peculiar behaviour of ic  5063 can not be visually explained using uniform or fragmented polar winds .",
    "the idea that agn winds may be hollow came while observing the 3-dimensional velocity field of the line - emitting gas over 1  kpc in ngc  1365 @xcite .",
    "the flow pattern of such a wind then naturally creates an x - shaped signal in the imaging .    the whim model investigated in this paper ( fig .",
    "[ fig1.3 ] bottom ) successfully reproduces shows the polarised flux ( total flux @xmath34 polarisation degree ) .",
    "we checked that the x - shape morphology is also reproduced in total flux , a straightforward conclusion as thomson scattering is wavelength - independent . ] the x - shaped morphology of ic  5063 , as well as the bright flux spot in the agn inner regions detected by @xcite .",
    "it indicates that thomson scattering is still a dominant mechanism at large distances from the central source of ic  5063 and it tends to support the idea that quasar outflows are hollow structures .",
    "however , not all agn where hollow winds are suggested show an x - shaped morphology ( see for instance ngc  2992 in @xcite or ngc  1068 in @xcite ) .",
    "a possible complication here may be that the amount of dust in the extended narrow line regions is high and thus prevents direct imaging of the hollow wind signatures .",
    "ngc  1068 is considered to be one of the most archetypical examples of thermal seyfert-2 galaxies . according to the simplest approach in agn unification models",
    "@xcite , the central region of ngc  1068 is hidden by optically thick , circumnuclear matter usually designated as a dusty torus .",
    "it is then a direct consequence of the circumnuclear dust that the radiation of the central engine escapes non - isotropically along the polar regions .",
    "it forms the so - called ionised winds that farther out interact with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy and give rise to narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "it is a common hypothesis that as a consequence of the collimation effect by the circumnuclear dust the polar outflows sustain the same half - opening angle as the dusty torus .",
    "this assumption is derived from the assumed axisymmetry of the unified model .",
    "however a recent study on ngc  1068 carried out by @xcite showed that the polar winds ( represented by a bi - conical structure ) are most likely inclined with respect to the obscuring torus axis . in the context of this work , several models of tilted outflows @xcite",
    "are being developed  but the off - axis outflow may also be explained by the structure for quasars if the radiation pressure field is not isotropic . in this case , the bending of the flow becomes non - axisymmetric and the extended outflow would appear tilted with respect to the symmetry axis of the system .",
    "conducting detailed radiative transfer simulations that include polarisation , we show that the structure for quasars suggested by @xcite can reproduce the observed optical polarisation properties of type-1 and type-2 agn if the standard version of the model is slightly modified : the bending angle of the wind should be lowered to @xmath50 and a dusty phase of moderate optical depth should be added to the wind .    without the dusty phase , i.e. for a pure whim outflow , the polarisation dichotomy of seyfert galaxies may still be reproduced for a certain , rather specific range of parameters but the predicted number density of type-2 agn would turn out too low .",
    "+ the modelling leads to some straightforward observational tests and future work :    1 .   the bending angle and covering factor of the extended winds that we derive from the polarisation modelling imply number densities for non - nal and nal agn , balqso s , as well as type-1 versus type-2 agn .",
    "such number counts can be derived from multi - waveband data obtained in large sky surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the distribution of covering factors is correlated with the fraction of ir luminosity .",
    "it is thus possible to test if the observed distribution of different agn types corresponds to their polarisation properties , and a preliminary investigation of the inclination - dependency of agn spectropolarimetric observations is ongoing .",
    "so far , our modelling only refers to uv / optical continuum radiation .",
    "computations for emission and absorption lines that also consider different velocity fields inside the wind are currently under way .",
    "furthermore , we intend to extend the modelling towards the x - ray regime and to compare the results to x - ray spectroscopy data .",
    "3 .   the exact wind geometry varies most likely with the bolometric luminosity of the agn .",
    "therefore , it is useful to study the polarisation properties of well - observed , individual agn with different average luminosities and to derive the resulting angles @xmath1 and @xmath22 for the two - phase wind model . possible trends of @xmath1 and @xmath22 with the luminosity can thus be investigated .",
    "it is interesting to note that , from a purely morphological point of view , the two - phase version of the wind model by @xcite is not in disagreement with the standard scenario of the unified scheme as analyzed in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is a major difference between the two interpretations to assume that the obscuring material originates in a wind instead of being part of the accretion inflow .",
