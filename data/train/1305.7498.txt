    "the hennings invariants ( and tqfts ) behave manifestly differently than wrt invariants on 3-manifolds with non - trivial homology for non - semisimple hopf algebras @xmath5 but often coincide or are very similar in other cases . indeed , in this article we will provide a precise relation between these two types of invariants in the special case of quantum @xmath6 .",

    "the 2-framing may be more conveniently thought of as the signature of a bounding 4-manifold @xcite or also the signature of a certain closure of the framed tangle representing the cobordism @xcite . the respective category @xmath8 with closed surfaces is related by an obvious fill functor @xmath9 which pastes a disk into the boundary component of a surface .",

    "we define an index two extension @xmath80 of the borel subalgebra of this small quantum group , and discuss its double balancing structures .",

    "although our method of constructing integral tqfts is rather different from approaches based on calculations of skeins and knots polynomials , it is interesting to observe that the same or similar technical constraints surface .",
    "for example , the combinatorial approach starting from wrt type tqfts as proposed by gilmer in @xcite finds dedekind domains to be the natural class of ground rings to consider .",
    "in other ways , the two types of tqft constructions exhibit fundamentally different behaviors .",
    "for example , the hennings setting used in this article naturally includes non - semisimple algebras and tqfts , which are more often related to geometrically constructed tqfts ( for a basic example see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "non - semisimplicity , is , however , incompatible with the non - degeneracy conditions required in the construction of @xcite , such as axiom  3 of @xcite , to infer integrality of tqfts from previous integrality results on closed manifolds such as @xcite .",
    "( the latter results , in turn , also heavily rely on semisimplicity as they are using decompositions into simple objects ) .    moreover ,",
    "the two approaches imply entirely different strategies for finding bases in the cases where the @xmath10-modules associated to surfaces are free . for the wrt - tqft associated to @xmath1 bases",
    "are obtained by carefully and intricately chosen combinations of skeins as in @xcite .",
    "there appear to be no obvious strategies for generalizations beyond the @xmath1-case .",
    "the hennings tqft associated to a general hopf algebra @xmath17 assigns to a punctured connected surface a tensor product of copies of @xmath17 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus if @xmath17 is freely and finitely generated as a module over @xmath10 a basis for @xmath17 immediately implies a basis for the respective tqft modules .",
    "the transition from modules associated to punctured surfaces to those of closed surfaces tends to be more subtle since the invariance functor preserves projectiveness but not necessarily freeness . particularly , the latter is identified with the subspace of @xmath91 invariant under the adjoint action of @xmath92 .",
    "find additional comments on this problem for the case @xmath93 in section  [ ss - tqft - sbz ] .",
    "note here however that freeness for the @xmath79$]-modules associated by the tqft extends to the case of closed surfaces for values of @xmath943 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 32 , 33 , 35 , 36 , 40 , 44 , 45 , 48 , 60 , 84 for the well known reason that in these cases @xmath79 $ ] has class number one @xcite and is thus a pid .",
    "thus in these cases projective modules are automatically free .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . section  [ s2 ] we review definitions of cobordism categories , their tangle presentations , and properties of hopf algebras that will be required for the subsequent tqft constructions . in section  [ sec - tqft ]",
    "we describe in more formal terms the tqft construction for surfaces with one boundary component that generalizes the hennings invariant for closed 3-manifolds , introducing auxiliary categories of @xmath5-labeled planar curves that will play an important technical role throughout the paper .",
    "several functors involving these categories are constructed , assuming a list of properties of the underlying hopf algebra , from which the tqft is assembled.the extension of the tqft functor to closed surfaces as well as the specialization to closed manifolds , resulting in the original hennings invariant are discussed in section  [ sec - tqft - invar ] .",

    "this is applied in section  [ sec - gaugeequiv ] to describe the effect of gauge transformations on the hennings tqft construction , resulting in the proof of theorem  [ thm - gttqft ] above together with an explicit formula for the natural isomorphism .    in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we develop the structure theory for quantum doubles of hopf algebras over dedekind domains as it pertains to the tqft construction given in section  [ sec - tqft ] .",
