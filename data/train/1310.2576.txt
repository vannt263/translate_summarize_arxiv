    "during the last few years , several research groups have been studying the light - matter interaction in quantum dots ( qds ) embedded in semiconductor microcavities , both experimentally [ 1 - 6 ] and theoretically [ 7 - 15 ] .",
    "such investigations lead to new phenomenology which in turn has lead to technological applications [ 16 - 21 ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "the generation of photons n - plets has been an interesting research branch , because it could allow researchers to prepare quantum states inside cavities which would be useful in quantum communication [ 22 ] . in particular , three - photons states can be obtained experimentally using spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) [ 23 - 28 ] , and third - order optical non - linearities in assembled [ 29 - 31 ] systems . in this sense , although several groups have managed to prepare and control specific quantum states @xcite , the preparation of arbitrary quantum states of light is still an experimental challenge .    bearing in mind the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) description of the light - matter interactions and the preparations of quantum states of light via spdc processes , we consider that it is possible to set up an experimental design in which the initial state inside a cavity can be prepared , and finely controlled .",
    "even though the cavity does not have to be microscopic , the experimental design is scalable from those of semiconductor microcavities .",
    "this means that the problem and the obtained results are not restricted to the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "therefore , in order to prepare the quantum state inside a cavity , a mesoscopic nonlinear crystal can be included to the experimental design .",
    "on the other hand , it has recently been demonstrated that photonic crystals ( phc ) cavities are capable of enhancing the harmonic generation produced by either a @xmath2 or a @xmath3 nonlinearity , which would finally yield to a spdc process [ 34 - 37 ] .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the adequate geometry of the phc @xcite , pump power @xcite and whether the cavity is singly or doubly resonant @xcite may lead to a @xmath4 conversion .    in this sense",
    ", we consider a semiconductor cavity in which there are a quantum dot ( qd ) and two nonlinear crystals .",
    "the former is coupled to a @xmath5 electromagnetic mode so the cavity is filled with @xmath5 photons .",
    "afterwards , these photons go through the nonlinear crystals and two spdc processes take place : @xmath0 , and @xmath1 . taking into account an exciton pumping and @xmath5 photon leakage out of the cavity , which are both incoherent processes , a three - photon state is accessible in the @xmath6 electromagnetic mode .",
    "the nonlinear cavity - quantum dot system can be constructed using a gaas substrate , over which several layers of @xmath7 , and a layer of @xmath8 in which the quantum dots are localized , are grown using the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) method . in this particular construction ,",
    "the optical properties are nonlinear @xcite , and therefore could be used as basis for the experimental design of our system .",
    "other such systems consists of phc made periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) @xcite or periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktp ) @xcite , which give rise to the enhancement of the harmonic generation .",
    "a possible drawback of this kind of experimental designs lies in the fact that the inclusion of qd into nonlinear cavities yield to physical phenomena such as the kerr effect ( due to the presence of other qds in the cavity ) , the harmonic generation , or the purcell effect ( due to the spontaneous emission from a dipole source ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that phc cavities can lead to an enhancement of the nonlinear phenomena and supress the spontaneous emission via a photonic bang gap , which increases the @xmath3 nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spdc processes can achieve a @xmath4 efficiency by using a doubly - resonant cavity @xcite , but producing such cavities is a challenge because they require confinement at two very different frequencies @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the model . in sec .",
    "3 we present our results and discuss its consequences . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we provide an overview of the results and conclude .",
    "our model considers the interaction between a qd and an electromagnetic mode inside a semiconductor cavity , followed by two consecutive spdc processes .",
    "the latter lead to a total of three electromagnetic modes .",
    "the qd s elementary excitations _",
    "-excitons_- are the result of an electron being promoted to the conduction from the valence band . in this paper , we model the interaction between the excitons and an electromagnetic mode with the usual jaynes - cummings model @xcite , whose hamiltonian is the following ( @xmath9 is taken as 1 along the paper ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath5 electromagnetic mode annihilation ( creation ) operator and @xmath12 is the exciton annihilation ( creation ) operator . the @xmath5 electromagnetic mode and the qd s exciton are coupled with the interaction strength @xmath13 and their frequencies are close enough to resonance to allow for the rotating wave approximation ; i.e. @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the two subsequent spdc processes generate two more electromagnetic modes with frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath15 . in the first process",
    ", one @xmath5 photon generates one @xmath6 and one @xmath15 photon @xmath16 , whereas in the second process one @xmath15 generates two @xmath6 photons @xmath17 . both processes",
    "may be described in an effective way by the following hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are the rates at which the processes occur and the @xmath21 are the @xmath22 mode annihilation ( creation ) operator .",
    "the physical system is depicted in the fig .",
    "1 and it is described by the jaynes - cummings plus spdc hamiltonians , @xmath23    the dynamical behaviour and the incoherent pumping and loss of the dot - cavity system is included in the master equation , which in the lindblad notation is written as , @xmath24+\\frac{p}{2}\\left(2\\sigma^{\\dagger}\\rho\\sigma - \\lbrace \\sigma\\sigma^{\\dagger},\\rho\\rbrace\\right ) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(2a_0\\rho a_0^{\\dagger } -\\lbrace a_0^{\\dagger}a_0,\\rho\\rbrace\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath26 is the rate at which @xmath5 photons escape from the cavity and @xmath27 is the rate at which excitation is pumped to the cavity and is linked to the rate at which the electron - hole pairs relax into the dot .     and",
    "@xmath20 ) yield to the spdc processes . ]    furthermore , the system s energy levels and its connection via the master equation given in eq .",
    "( [ master eq . ] ) is shown schematically in fig .",
    "each energy level is associated to a quantum state written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the qd state ( either ground or excited ) , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the photon number in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath15 mode of the electromagnetic field , respectively .",
    "the presented scheme shows the energy levels accessible for the @xmath33 state by just one process .",
    "state by just one process .",
    "the energy levels are depicted by straight continuous lines corresponding to quantum states .",
    "the blue double lines correspond to the interaction between the qd and the @xmath5 mode .",
    "the black ( red ) double lines connect the accessible states via the spdc process associated to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the continuous black lines describe the @xmath5 leakage process , whereas the green piecewise line correspond to the incoherent exciton pumping . ]",
    "we solved the master equation given in ( [ master eq . ] ) numerically , using the following parameter values : he dipole - like interaction constant between the qd and the @xmath5-mode is set to be @xmath34 mev ; the excitation energy of the qd is set as @xmath35 mev which in turn is tuned perfectly with the @xmath5-mode ; i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "these values are the usual for @xmath37 cavities operating in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "furthermore , restraining our results to the low - excitation regime , we set the incoherent pumping rate @xmath27 to be @xmath38.@xmath39ev , whereas the cavity losses for the fundamental mode @xmath5 is taken as @xmath40.@xmath41 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the spdc rates are taken as @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 mev , following the recommendations presented in @xcite .",
    "we consider the qd in its excited state and the electromagnetic field to be in a vacuum state in all of its modes , as the system s initial condition . with this set up , we observe that the state of the @xmath6 electromagnetic mode reaches a so - called three - photon state , which is a superposition of @xmath44-photons fock states , within the system s dynamics .",
    "this results are shown in the fig .",
    "3 .    in this way",
    ", we have obtained results similar to those presented in @xcite , considering explicitly the interaction between a quantum dot in a semiconductor cavity and an electromagnetic field .",
    "this results are very interesting , since we have shown that a three - photon state can be prepared inside a semiconductor cavity made of photonic crystals capable of enhancing the harmonic generation produced by either a @xmath2 or a @xmath3 nonlinearity .     mode for three different time intervals .",

    "in this paper we have studied theoretically the preparation of a three - photon state inside a semiconductor cavity made of photonic crystals capable of enhancing the harmonic generation produced by either a @xmath2 or a @xmath3 nonlinearity .",
    "the three - photon state is the result of the interaction between a quantum dot embedded in the cavity and a @xmath5 mode of the electromagnetic field , and two spontaneous parametric downconversion processes yielding to two more modes of the electromagnetic field : @xmath0 , and @xmath1 . to study the system s dynamics",
    "we have solved a lindblad master equation numerically considering both an incoherent excitation pump rate and @xmath5-photon leakage from the cavity . in this way , we have observed that the three - photon state is accessible within the dynamics in the @xmath6-mode in a low - excitation regime .",
