    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are very peculiar baryons in that they are very hard to manufacture from hadron based material .",
    "doubly strange baryons will first have to be made from two singly strange hadrons via hadronic scattering before they can collide with another singly strange hadron to make the triply strange @xmath0 .",
    "as such @xmath0 and @xmath1 require a very long time to come into chemical equilibrium in a hadron gas .",
    "it is a virtual impossibility in nuclear collisions if only a hadron gas is formed in such collisions @xcite .",
    "while the yields of other hadrons in heavy ion collisions do not present too much of a problem for dynamical models to reproduce , this is not true for strange hyperons , especially the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for example , one of the more well - known and sophisticated models , namely the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model , which is basically a hadronic model supplemented with strings for particle production , could only generate much lower yields than the experimental measurements at the sps . only by readjusting a few paramenters in the model , either by increasing the string tension by a factor of three or by reducing the constituent quark masses down to the values of the current quark masses ,",
    "could the same yield as found at the sps be reproduced @xcite .",
    "other dynamical models also have problems in generating the same triply strange hyperons abundance as found at the sps .",
    "the fact that other hadrons did not present much problem for the various models seemed to suggest that for the majority of the particles the essence of the basic production mechanisms as well as their interactions had been successfully captured in these models . alas , this does not seem to be true for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "further signs of an anomaly can be found in the thermal fit to the particle ratios as measured in experiments .",
    "such fits are useful in helping to determine whether the system as a whole has achieved thermal as well as chemical equilibrium . a global freeze - out temperature , collective flow velocity , system size at freeze - out , chemical potentials etc can be obtained .",
    "the quality of the fit is arguably captured in the value of the @xmath2 . the smaller it is , the better is the fit .",
    "it was found that if particle ratios as measured by the wa97 and the na49 collaborations at the sps involving @xmath0 and @xmath1 were excluded , then the value of @xmath2 would be reduced by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the triply strange hyperon and antihyperon therefore deviate from the other hadrons .",
    "any suspicion to the contrary is dispelled by an examination of the trend of the slopes of the @xmath3 spectra of the hadrons .",
    "most of the hadrons exhibit a linear increase of the value of the slope parameter with increasing mass @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 show little desire of following this linear trend with a deviation of six or more standard deviations @xcite .    in brief @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "show every sign of being a very different type of hadron .",
    "there is an overall tendency of more @xmath0 and @xmath1 being produced than expected in most cases .",
    "this seems to suggest that their production is not well understood or there might be an additional mechanism that has not been taken into account .",
    "we will propose a mechanism below for this and attempt to provide arguments , support , and experimental evidence that such a possibility is not excluded by the data at the sps .",
    "in we explained why there seemed to exist an anomaly in the yield of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and a novel mechanism for their production was called for .",
    "we now make the claim that this anomaly is caused by the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc ) @xcite .",
    "this claim obviously requires a lot of explanation ; afterall , dcc are usually associated with low energy pions or more precisely the observable for dcc is the distribution of the ratio of neutral to overall pion yield and not baryons .",
    "in addition dcc have proven to be elusive ; all searches for them so far ended invariably in failure .",
    "therefore the chance that our invocation of the possibility of dcc formation is correct might apparently seem rather remote .",
    "however one should not jump to the conclusion that just because dcc did not manifest themselves in the distribution of the low energy pion ratio , it would necessarily mean that no dcc were formed .",
    "it was realized quite early that dcc could only be observed if sufficiently large domains were formed in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in the absence of large domains",
    ", the distribution of the low energy neutral to total pion ratio could not be distinguished from the case of no dcc formation .",
    "provided that our claim does not require that large domains be formed then there will be no contradiction .",
    "this will be discussed later when our idea is applied to experimental data at the sps .",
    "having partially answered the question about the fact that no dcc have been observed and stressed that it could not be fully answered in this section without considering experimental data , let us turn to the other question about how hyperons and antihyperons can be related to dcc .",
    "four decades ago skyrme considered the following lagrangian density _",
    "s = ( _ u^u^ ) + ^2 where u = \\{i /f _ } = ( + i ) /f _ , @xmath4 is the pion decay constant and @xmath5 is a coupling constant which turned out to be essentially that of the @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath6 interaction .",
    "this lagrangian density is later known as that of the skyrme model .",
    "it consists of the non - linear sigma model and the skyrme quartic interaction term .",
    "the latter is quartic in the sense that it has four @xmath8 units .",
    "the equation of motion from this lagrangian is known to have classical topologically non - trivial solutions known as skyrmions .",
    "they come in the totally spherically symmetric form u = u_s = \\{i f(r ) } where @xmath9 must satisfy certain very specific boundary conditions .",
    "they are f(r ) 0 f(r=0 ) = n .",
    "@xmath10 in the last expression is the integral valued winding number .",
    "it has been identified as the baryon number @xcite .",
    "these classical solutions are therefore baryons or antibaryons for @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear now that classical chiral fields can not only produced pions , they can also generate baryons and antibaryons . unlike making pions , however",
    ", the classical chiral fields must have a non - trivial topology before they can produce baryons .",
    "equivalently they must acquire a non - zero winding number in order to generate skyrmions or anti - skyrmions .",
    "this does not happen automatically .",
    "for the classical fields to obtain a non - zero winding number is not trivial . to describe how this might happen ,",
    "it is best to illustrate it with the linear sigma model whose lagrangian density is = _ ^^ _ - ( ^_-v^2 ) ^2 -v _ sb [ eq : lsm ] where @xmath12 is a compactified four component field which spans a 4-d space of the chiral fields and @xmath13 is the symmetry breaking potential usually introduced to give the pion a mass and to break the @xmath14 symmetry as manifested by the other terms in to favour the @xmath15-direction . our goal here is to convey in simple terms how non - zero winding number could be obtained from suitable field configurations . including @xmath13 in the discussion",
    "will only complicate matters so in the following we will drop it or set @xmath16 .",
    "the vacuum of the theory will take centre stage in the following discussion which , from the second term of , is @xmath17 or the surface of a sphere in 4-d .",
    "this is also the order parameter space for the chiral phase transition or the space of the condensates .",
    "since it is hard to visualize a sphere in 4-d , we will temporarily go back to 3-d in the space of the condensates and to 2-d in actual space .",
    "once the basic idea is understood , it is easy to extrapolate back to 4-d .    whenever dcc are being considered",
    ", one must also include domains in the discussion .",
    "after reducing the dimensions by one everywhere as mentioned above , the resulting flat space can be triangulated into domains .",
    "an example is shown in with vertices @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the size of the domain is such that each vertex is separated from the others by at least a unit of the correlation length @xmath20 so that each one has , in general , a different value of the condensate @xmath21 .",
    "the latter will be situated somewhere on @xmath22 the dimensionally reduced order parameter space .",
    "this is illustrated on the right in .",
    "forming a winding number of one can be crudely understood as having the patch formed by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in to cover the whole of @xmath22 by stretching them to join @xmath26 on the other side of the sphere .",
    "actually it is not necessary to form full winding all at once , it is only required for the condensates @xmath21 to situate and spread themselves on @xmath22 in such a way that there is a chance for full winding to develop in time .",
    "the required configuration is that @xmath26 must be situated on the antipodal point of the centre of the patch formed by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . by randomly distributing four points on @xmath22 , on the average",
    "there is a probability of @xmath27 that such a configuration is formed .",
    "the corresponding triangulated spatial region has an area of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the probability per unit area for this to happen is /a = .",
    "returning to the actual case of the order parameter space being @xmath17 and space being 3-dimensional , the triangulated spatial domain is now a tetrahedron as shown in and the `` patch '' formed by the condensates @xmath21 , @xmath29 on @xmath17 is likewise a tetrahedron .",
    "the configuration required for full winding to be able to develop is now that @xmath26 must be at the `` antipodal '' point of the centre of this tetrahedron on @xmath17 . randomly distributing five points on @xmath17 results in on the average a probability of @xmath30 for this configuration to happen in a spatial volume of @xmath31 .",
    "the probability per unit volume for skyrmion or anti - skyrmion to form is thus /v",
    "we have of course discussed an idealized situation where there is no symmetry breaking , no interactions amongst the neighbouring domains etc . when these are taken into account , numerical simulations of global texture formation in the expanding universe showed that the actual probability is smaller by about a factor of three @xcite .",
    "therefore the total probability per unit volume for the formation of skyrmion and anti - skyrmion pair ( due to conservation of baryon number ) is /v 0.08 ^-3 .",
    "note that the probability per unit volume is larger the smaller the domain size .",
    "this mechanism is thus orthogonal to the usual observable of dcc which is the distribution of pion ratio which requires large domains to form for observation to be possible . although the above probability per unit volume is derived for flavour @xmath32 , we will follow @xcite and make the identification @xmath33 since computations suggested they be similar .",
    "we are now ready to apply these results to the sps data .",
    "our primary interest is in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yield . at the sps data are only available from the wa97 collaboration @xcite .",
    "although the na49 collaboration also measured strange baryon and antibaryon yields @xcite , the results of the triply strange baryons are not yet available .",
    "however the data of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the wa97 collaboration is only concentrated within one unit around @xmath34 because of their limited rapidity coverage .",
    "they gave @xcite @xmath35 the na49 collaboration has a wider coverage in @xmath36 but no @xmath0 and @xmath1 data are available .",
    "fortunately it just so happened that both collaborations have measured the yield of the doubly strange @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore the latter from na49 have been extrapolated to the full momentum space in @xcite for use in thermal analysis . from wa97",
    "we have @xmath39 and from na49 the extrapolated to full momentum space data are @xcite @xmath40 collectively such data permit us to extrapolate in turn the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yield to full momentum space . for example the total @xmath1 yield can be obtained from the combination ( ) _ ( ) _ ( ^- + |^+ ) _",
    "so roughly there can be expected on the average half a @xmath1 per central collision at the sps .      with the available data , one can also try to estimate the total number of baryons and antibaryons originated from dcc . since dcc only yield low energy hadrons",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that only octet and decuplet baryons or antibaryons and no higher resonances will be generated .",
    "we also assume that they are equally likely to be produced independent of flavour .",
    "the fact that there are so few @xmath1 prompts us to assume that all of them are from dcc .",
    "altogether there are eight spin-1/2 octet baryons and ten spin-3/2 decuplet baryons which make a total of 16 + 40=56 possibilities .",
    "only four of these can yield @xmath1 . in order to give half a @xmath1 per central collision on the average",
    "there must be about seven anti - skyrmions formed per central collision . because of baryon number conservation , anti - skyrmion must form at the same time as skyrmion so there must be a total of about fourteen baryons and antibaryons originating from dcc per central collision . for the more abundant baryons , for example protons : there are only a quarter of a proton on the average per central collision that came from dcc and so this extra source of baryons and antibaryons can only be detected from the yields of the much rarer hyperons .",
    "in we discussed the fact that no dcc have so far been detected from the distribution of the low energy neutral to total pion ratio and that this fact should not automatically be interpreted as no dcc formation in heavy ion collisions . rather it could be a sign that no large dcc domains were able to form because the conditions found in these collisions might not be favourable for such formations .",
    "we now try to reinforce this idea by estimating the domain size from the available data and from the theoretical consideration , in particular the probability per unit volume for skyrmion and anti - skyrmion formation already discussed in the previous sections .    at the sps",
    "there are about 2000 hadrons being produced in a central collision . assuming that dcc formed at a time when the density is approximately ten times that of nuclear matter density , 1.7 hadrons/@xmath41 then the probability @xmath42 introduced in would give a domain size of @xmath43 fm .",
    "theoretical studies in dcc formation gave an estimate of the domain size of @xmath44 fm for a system evolved in time while in equilibrium @xcite and a size of @xmath45 fm in the annealing scenario where the effective potential gradually evolved from the chirally symmetric form back towards the vacuum form @xcite .",
    "our phenomenological estimate of @xmath43 fm is thus consistent with the estimates made based on various theoretical considerations .",
    "unfortunately it was known that domains of such small size would not reveal dcc in the distribution of the pion ratios .",
    "our point here is that the proposal of dcc as the extra source of baryons and antibaryons does not contradict the fact that they have not been observed so far via other means .",
    "so far everything seems to be consistent .",
    "however , we must verify that the number of @xmath0 and @xmath1 thus generated can not be easily changed in the system .",
    "if they can be easily destroyed and subsequently be recreated then the trace of dcc will be washed out by such processes of chemical equilibration . since chemical equilibration of @xmath0 in a hadronic environment",
    "is known to be very slow and inefficient , one can almost be certain that the triply strange baryons and antibaryons thus formed are safe .",
    "let us not assume this but make some estimates as to the timescale required for their destruction or removal from the system .",
    ".the timescales for destruction of @xmath0 at different temperatures . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     some possible destructive processes are @xmath0 being hit by the more abundant @xmath6 s and @xmath46 s in the system and thus converted into @xmath37 .",
    "+ k + k + + in order to make estimates of the timescale for such process , we will assume that everything else except the triply strange baryons are in equilibrium and the interaction matrix elements between the hadrons are universal .",
    "then a rate equation for the destruction of @xmath0 or @xmath1 can be obtained similarly to the rate equations for chemical equilibration as found in @xcite .",
    "we write = - _ _ k + +  v_ r_5 _ ^__ - _ _ + k +  v _",
    "k r_1 _ k^__ [ eq : rd ] where r_5 = _ k^_^ r_1 = _ ^_^ , and @xmath47 is the equilibrium number density of the hadron @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 quantities are the same as those in @xcite .",
    "they are necessary because the thermal averaged cross - sections given in are for the backward processes .",
    "these averaged cross - sections have been calculated in @xcite and their temperature dependence had been plotted in their figure 5.2 .",
    "one is seen to be weakly dependent on temperature while the dependence of the other is quite strong .",
    "the latter is obviously due to threshold because the reaction @xmath50 has to overcome a mass gap of @xmath51 . for the purpose of obtaining the destruction timescales from the ,",
    "these thermal averaged cross - sections can be parameterized as follows . _",
    "_ k + +  v_ = 0.22 _ _ + k + v _ k = 1.7 ( ) \\{-705/t } from them one can obtain the timescales for the two processes . _ _ + k + = 160 ( ) ^3/2 \\{142.5/t } _ _ k + + = 36 ( ) ^2 \\{354/t } putting in various values for the temperatures one finds that these timescales , tabulated in , are extremely long in the context of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the chance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 produced from dcc surviving the hadronic medium until the final breakup and thus leaving a trace of dcc for detection is therefore very high .",
    "in this article signs of an anomaly in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 produced at the sps were pointed out .",
    "these came in the form of a deviation from the trend set by the other hadrons as well as from the yield of the triply strange hyperon .",
    "there was an attempt to explain the anomaly in the slope of the @xmath3 spectra using the relativistic molecular dynamics model in @xcite .",
    "similar deviation in the linear increase of the slope with mass was shown for @xmath0 .",
    "they concluded that the cause of this was due to the fact that @xmath0 and @xmath1 had not the same flow as the remaining hadrons .",
    "however they also found that @xmath0 and @xmath1 were formed very early in the time evolution of the collisions .",
    "if there was a formation of deconfined matter in these collisions , then the @xmath0 and @xmath1 would practically be existing at the same time with the deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "this point is quite difficult to understand .",
    "we have proposed that dcc formation be the cause of the anomaly .",
    "the rarity of the yield of @xmath0 and @xmath1 means that any addition production mechanisms would readily manifest themselves and cause deviation from the other more abundant hadrons . because @xmath0 and @xmath1 thus produced",
    "would automatically be at low @xmath52 or essentially at rest , they naturally have not the same flow velocity as the other hadrons .",
    "thus if we accept the flow related part of the explanation of the slope in the @xmath3 spectra provided by @xcite , a much smaller value of the slope parameter than expected is not too surprising . from the sps data we have checked that our proposal is consistent with the non - observation of dcc in the distribution of low energy pion ratios and",
    "that the anomaly can survive the lifetime of the nuclear collisions",
    ". therefore dcc formation could very plausibly be responsible for the observed anomaly in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thanks the organizers for support , and for a very useful and enjoyable conference ."
