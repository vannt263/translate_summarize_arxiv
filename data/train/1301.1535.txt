    "( as it can be done in following the steps described above ) one knows that the degree of the graph is at least @xmath106 .",
    "let us now state the following :    if @xmath51 is a bipartite , vacuum graph of degree zero , then @xmath51 has a face with two vertices .    _ proof .",
    "_ let s call @xmath107 the number of faces of length @xmath108 , @xmath109 the length of the @xmath110 face .",
    "we then have the following identities : @xmath111 let us recall here that for bipartite graphs there can not be faces of length one .",
    "we now write equation as : @xmath112 we then get by substracting the second line from the first one : @xmath113 since @xmath114 , this implies that @xmath115 . .",

    "since @xmath51 is bipartite , we can choose a four - coloration of its edges .",
    "once we have chosen a coloration , @xmath116 has two colors , denoted by @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we then consider the jacket @xmath84 not containing the face @xmath116 . since @xmath119 the jacket @xmath84 is planar and of the form of fig.[jform ] .",

    "this implies that @xmath51 is two particle reducible for any couple of colored lines touching @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",

    "if the subgraph @xmath122 is empty then the lines of color different of @xmath69 form a subgraph with three colors .",
    "otherwise , we cut the external lines of @xmath122 and reconnect the two external half lines into a new line of color @xmath123 ; we call the resulting new graph @xmath124 .",
    "one remarks that the bipartite caracter is conserved through this procedure .",
    "moreover it is of null degree , thus from the previous proposition it has a face of length two .",
    "we can thus apply the same reasoning , recursively , to this graph . finally , the graph @xmath51 is of the form of fig .",

    "tensor models , which contain a significantly larger class of graphs than the colored model .",
    "we have proved that the melonic graphs are still the leading ones in the large @xmath4 limit .",
