    "heavy baryon lifetimes provide testing ground for the standard model , especially for qcd in some aspects , because they can be calculated systematically by heavy quark expansion @xcite . theoretically , if we do not assume the failure of the local duality assumption , the heavy hadron lifetime differences appear , at most , at the order of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "recent experimental result on the lifetime ratio of the @xmath0 baryon and @xmath6 meson is @xcite @xmath7 which has shown some deviation from the theoretical expectation .",
    "this is one of issues concerned with the tests of the heavy quark expansions and has drawn a lot of theoretical attention @xcite , and may imply the potential importance of the @xmath8 effect for the above heavy baryon and heavy meson lifetime difference @xcite .",
    "it is at the order @xmath9 that appear four - quark operators , whose contributions to decay widths are enhanced by a phase - space factor of @xmath10 with respect to the leading terms in the operator product expansion . consequently one should include them in the prediction for non - leptonic decay rates @xcite , to the order of @xmath9 , the lifetime ratio was calculated as follows @xcite , @xmath11 & & + \\xi\\{p_1b_1(m_b)+p_2b_2(m_b)+p_3\\epsilon_1(m_b)+p_4\\epsilon_2(m_b ) + [ p_5+p_6\\tilde{b}(m_b)]r(m_b)\\ } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the term proportional to @xmath12 arises from the contributions of four - quark operators .",
    "the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 s ( @xmath15 ) have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the averages of @xmath18-quark kinetic and chromomagnetic energy , respectively . to the order of @xmath19 , the lifetime ratio is @xmath20 . at the scale @xmath21 ,",

    "( [ 3 ] ) , generally the renormalization scale is arbitrary , and the parameters depend on it .",
    "it can be taken naturally at the low hadronic scale to apply the heavy quark expansion .",
    "these parameters should be calculated by some nonperturbative qcd method .",
    "the qcd sum rule @xcite , which is regarded as a nonperturbative method rooted in qcd itself , has been used successfully to calculate the properties of various hadrons . in refs . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the mesonic parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 have been calculated by the qcd sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the baryonic parameters @xmath2 and @xmath32 have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result , to the order of @xmath9 , the theoretical calculation still can not explain the experiment result ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we try to match the experimental data by considering more subtleties in the theoretical analysis . as analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lifetime ratio ( [ 1 ] ) depends crucially on the value of the baryonic parameter @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we shall carry out a reanalysis for baryonic parameter @xmath2 by the qcd sum rule .",
    "we note that in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , more condensates could be included in .",
    "they are gluon condensate and six - quark condensate",
    ". it may be important because the dimension of the gluon condensate is four . in spite of being dimension nine",
    ", the six - quark condensate may also have significant contribution , because the diagram is not suppressed by any loop factor .",
    "experience from the heavy baryon masses tells us that the pure tree diagram is important @xcite .",
    "therefore in our calculation , these two kinds of condensates will be considered , in addition to those considered in ref .",
    ".    the conclusion of @xmath36 does not change .",
    "it follows from the valence quark approximation which is used both in ref .",

    ", this green s function @xmath53 can be calculated in terms of quark and gluon language with vacuum condensates .",
    "this establishes the sum rule . for the resonance part of eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , we adopt the assumption of quark - hadron duality .",
    "the calculation of @xmath53 in hqet is straightforward .",
    "the fixed point gauge @xcite is used .",
    "the tadpole diagrams in which the light quark lines from the four - quark vertex are contracted have been subtracted .",
    "the following values of the condensates are used , @xmath60 note we have adopted the new value for the gluon condensate from the recent analysis of the heavy quarkonium spectrum @xcite . however ,",
    "our final results are not very sensitive to the gluon condensate since its contribution is only about @xmath61 of the whole sum rule as shall see later .    except for the quark gluon mixed condensate , our calculation would be consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite if the gluon and six - quark condensates were omitted .",
    "while the calculation can be justified if ( @xmath62 ) and ( @xmath63 ) are large , however the hadron ground state property should be obtained at small ( @xmath62 ) and ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "these contradictory requirements are achieved by introducing double borel transformation for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath66 there are two borel parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "they appear symmetrically , so @xmath69 is taken in the following analysis .",
    "the reason for the factor @xmath70 is similar to that explained in the ref .",
    "generally the duality is to simulate the higher states by the whole quark and gluon contribution above some threshold energy @xmath71 .",
    "the whole contribution of the three - point correlator @xmath53 can be expressed by the dispersion relation , @xmath72 with the redefinition of the integral variables @xmath73 the integration becomes @xmath74 it is in @xmath75 that the quark - hadron duality is assumed @xcite , @xmath76 this kind of assumption was suggested in calculating the isgur - wise function in ref .",
    "@xcite and was argued for in ref .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , in calculating three - point functions the duality is valid after integrating the spectral density over the `` off - diagonal '' variable @xmath77 .",
    "the sum rule for @xmath78 after the integration with the variable @xmath79 is obtained as @xmath80 & & \\displaystyle + \\frac{3(a^2+b^2)}{2048\\pi^6}\\nu^4 \\langle g^2_sg^2 \\rangle + \\frac{5ab}{48\\pi^4 } m_0 ^ 2\\langle\\bar{q}q\\rangle \\nu^3 \\nonumber\\\\[3 mm ] & & \\displaystyle + \\kappa_1 \\frac{17(a^2+b^2)}{96\\pi^2 } \\langle\\bar{q}q\\rangle^2 \\nu^2 \\ } -\\kappa_2 \\frac{ab}{144 } \\langle\\bar{q}q\\rangle^3 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 are the scale parameters used to indicate the possible deviation from the factorization assumption for the four- and six - quark condensates .",
    "@xmath83 corresponds to the vacuum saturation approximation .",
    "@xmath84 is often introduced in order to include the nonfactorizable contribution and to fit the data @xcite .",
    "there is no discussion of @xmath82 in literature so we use @xmath85 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the choice @xmath86 tends to yield the optimal interpolating current for the @xmath0 baryon in hqet .",
    "we shall adopt @xmath86 in our numerical analysis .",

    "( [ 19 ] ) , because they are also neglected in the sum rule for @xmath2 ( [ 17 ] ) .",

    "( [ 19 ] ) to extract @xmath78 .",
    "the variation of the matrix element with @xmath71 for two values of @xmath96 is given in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath71 is @xmath97 gev .",
    "the sum rule window is @xmath98 gev , which is almost the same as that in the two - point correlator sum rule .",
    "we obtain for @xmath99 @xmath100 by taking @xmath101 mev , @xmath102 if we use @xmath103 , we get @xmath104 @xmath105    in our numerical calculation , the contribution of the perturbative term is smaller than those of the condensates due to small @xmath94 in the duality window and high dimensionality of the spectral function ( @xmath106 in eq . ( 18 ) ) .",
    "there are several known examples where the perturbative part has small contribution in the sum rule @xcite , without affecting the reliability of the results .",
    "nevertheless , a hierarchical structure among various condensate terms exists in those cases and the present case . in the present case , because of the cancellation between the contributions of the quark condensate and the mixed condensate , as well as the smallness of the contributions of the gluon and the six - quark condensates , the influence of the four - quark condensate is significant and is enhanced by assuming the deviation from the vacuum saturation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors used the following duality assumption , @xmath107 in their calculation the matrix element @xmath78 increases from @xmath108gev@xmath91 to @xmath109gev@xmath91 in the working region of the borel parameter when @xmath71 varies from @xmath110 gev to @xmath111 gev .",
    "in other words , their analysis is very sensitive to the continuum threshold , which might imply the above duality assumption is not good .",
    "in contrast , the dependence on @xmath71 is not so strong in our approach .",
    "the @xmath112 corrections to the above results can be analyzed in principle . while having little influence on our above calculation , they formally belong to the @xmath113 effects to the @xmath0 lifetime .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath2 we have obtained above is at some hadronic scale , other than the scale @xmath21 , because we have been working in the framework of the hqet , in which the natural scale is @xmath114 .",
    "the renormalization group evolution of the relevant operators was calculated in ref .",

    "( [ 24-a ] ) , we see that with the vacuum saturation ( @xmath103 ) , although @xmath2 is enhanced by about six times compared to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is still not large enough to account for the data eq .",
    "the life time ratio between @xmath126 and @xmath6 mesons can be explained if we also take into account the nonfactorizable contribution of the four - quark condensate , as can be seen from eq .",

    "in summary , we have reanalyzed the qcd sum rule for the @xmath0 matrix element of the four - quark operator relevant to the lifetime of @xmath0 .",
    "compared to the previous analysis @xcite , the new ingredients we have introduced are that ( i ) more condensates are considered ; ( ii ) different quark - hadron duality is adopted and ( iii ) the possible deviation from the vacuum saturation assumption for the four quark condensates is considered . of these ingredients ,",
