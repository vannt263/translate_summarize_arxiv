    "the short - time motion of small particles fluctuating in a newtonian fluid is strongly affected by fluid inertia , that is , the vorticity of the host fluid surrounding the dispersed particles . if a dispersed particle accelerates due to brownian forces , it affects the motion of the host fluid in the neighborhood of the particle , while the vorticity generated by the particle s motion then affects the motion of the same particle .",
    "these effects are referred to as memory effects and have an important role in the dynamical motion of a dispersion on short time scales @xcite .",
    "the vorticity diffuses away on a kinematic time scale @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radius of the spherical particle and @xmath2 is the kinematic viscosity of the host fluid ( @xmath3 s for @xmath4 m in water ) . when the vorticity diffuses away much faster than the particle s motion , _",
    "i_._e_. @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of a brownian particle and @xmath7 is the shear viscosity of the host fluid , the motion of a brownian particle is well approximated by the normal langevin equation , which is valid for strong damping ( reynolds number @xmath8 ) or long time scales ; however , this equation , wherein the effects of the fluid inertia are ignored is not applicable to a dispersion composed of neutrally buoyant particles since @xmath9 is comparable to @xmath10 . for a complete understanding of the short - time motion of a dispersion",
    ", the inertias of the particle and the host fluid can not be neglected .",
    "one way to account for memory effects is to simultaneously resolve the fluid motion with the particle motion as a boundary condition to be satisfied .",
    "we refer to this approach as the direct numerical simulation(dns ) approach . within the dns approach ,",
    "various numerical methods have been developed @xcite , and the power - law decay behavior in the velocity autocorrelations of a free brownian particle has been accurately reproduced .",
    "this slow relaxation of the correlation behavior is one of the main features of memory effects .",
    "although most of these methods have been applied to dispersions composed of free brownian particles at thermal equilibrium , dispersions under flows that are far from equilibrium have not been examined in detail , even for the simple case of a single brownian particle in a shear flow on a short time scale , @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , most numerical methods used for concentrated dispersions under shear , which are widely used for measuring rheological properties , are limited to a reynolds number of zero , and the short - time motions of the dispersed particles in concentrated dispersions can not be correctly tracked .",
    "recently , we have developed a numerical method , known as the `` smoothed profile method ( spm ) '' @xcite , for the dns of particulate flows .",
    "its computational accuracy and efficiency have been examined carefully by lio et al . for several flow problems @xcite .",
    "the spm has been applied to a dispersion composed of free brownian particles at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we have also succeeded in reproducing the power - law decay behavior in the translational and rotational velocity autocorrelations of a brownian particle , and these results agree well with hydrodynamic analytical solutions for a free brownian particle in an infinite fluid that accounts for memory effects . in order to simulate dispersions in non - equilibrium conditions on short time",
    "scales in which memory effects become significant , we have modified the spm .",
    "the primary objective of the present work is to accurately examine the short - time motion of brownian particles in a simple shear flow by using the modified spm . in this paper , we first present the modified spm , in which external forces are introduced to impose a shear flow into the system . in order to validate the method , we next compare the numerical results for the mean square displacement ( msd ) with a hydrodynamic analytical solution of a brownian particle in simple shear flows that account for fluid inertia .",
    "furthermore , we apply our method to a dispersion composed of many spherical particles under shear .",
    "the msd in the vorticity direction is then calculated for several volume fractions , and the time evolution is discussed .",
    "finally , the shear - induced diffusion coefficients are measured from the long - time behavior of the msd , and the dependence of the determined diffusion coefficients on the volume fraction is examined .",
    "let us consider a monodisperse dispersion of repulsive spherical particles in a newtonian host fluid .",
    "the dispersion is subjected to shear by an external force .",
    "the position of the @xmath12th particle is @xmath13 , the translational velocity is @xmath14 , and the rotational velocity is @xmath15 .",
    "the velocity and pressure fields of the host fluid are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "these field quantities are defined on three - dimensional cartesian grids ; @xmath18 [ -l_y/2,l_y/2][0,l_z]$ ] .",
    "in order to distinguish the particle and fluid domains on the grids , a smoothed function @xmath19 , which is equal to @xmath20 in the particle domains and @xmath21 in the fluid domains , is introduced .",
    "these domains are separated by a thin interfacial domain of thickness @xmath22 .",
    "the length unit is taken to be the lattice spacing @xmath23 , and the time unit is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the density of the host fluid .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath26th dispersed particle with mass @xmath27 and moment of inertia @xmath28 is governed by newton s equations of motion : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted by the host fluid on the particle @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 is a repulsive force that is employed to prevent particle overlaps , and a truncated lennard - jones potential , @xmath33 $ ] for @xmath34 or @xmath35 , is adopted in this work .",
    "here @xmath36 , and @xmath37 represents the diameter of particles .",
    "@xmath38and @xmath39 are random forces and torques , respectively , due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are introduced as white noise with a zero mean and correlations @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are numerical parameters that control the translational and rotational particle temperatures , namely , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the angular brackets denote taking an average over an equilibrium ensemble .",
    "the temperatures are determined by the following procedure ; first a single brownian particle at thermal equilibrium is simulated with fixed @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". then the translational and rotational long - time diffusion coefficients are obtained from the simulation . by comparing these diffusion coefficients with stokes - einstein diffusion coefficients , @xmath48 for the translational motion and @xmath49 for the rotational motion",
    ", we finally can determine the temperatures .",
    "since both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are chosen to satisfy @xmath50 , the temperatures are simply written as @xmath51 throughout this paper .",

    "@xmath54 is an external force field that is introduced to enforce the following velocity profile , @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the shear rate of the imposed flow and @xmath57 denotes the distance in the velocity - gradient direction .",
    "this velocity profile , schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ profile ] , enables us to solve the motion of the host fluid with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the temperature was determined by measuring the long - time diffusion coefficient of a single brownian particle at thermal equilibrium before the shear was imposed .",

    "the initial configuration of the spherical particle is located at the central position of the system .",
    "the volume fraction of a single particle is @xmath75 .",
    "an important feature of a single brownian particle in a simple shear flow is that the msd in the flow direction varies asymptotically with time as @xmath76 . although we would expect t - dependence of the msd in the long - time limit , this non - diffusional behavior is explained as a result of a coupling between diffusive motion in the velocity - gradient direction and convective motion due to shear in the flow direction .",
    "theoretical solutions to this problem show the msd in the flow direction(@xmath62 ) is composed of three parts : @xmath77 assuming that , at @xmath78 , the particle is in the initial position ( @xmath21 , @xmath79 , @xmath21 ) , wherein the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ msdx ] ) is a shear contribution only , and represents the simple translation of a particle along the streamline in the flow direction .",
    "the second term is the coupling term described above , which represents the convection induced by diffusion . the third term , which is in the same form as the msd of a free brownian particle , is a thermal contribution only .",

    "the diffusion time characterizing the diffusive motion is @xmath93 , which measures the particle diffusion over the particle size .",
    "another dynamical quantity of interest is the positional cross - correlation @xmath94 of a brownian particle in a simple shear flow .",

    "this detailed analysis of the msd is sufficient to confirm the validity of our method of incorporating memory effects ; however , within our method , it is assumed that the thermal fluctuations can be represented by white and gaussian noise .",
    "this means that correlations between thermal noise at different times are completely ignored , although in the theoretical framework of the gle , noises are correlated . the thermal noise memory , which we ignore ,",

    "the time at which the diffusive region is attained shifts to shorter times at higher volume fractions . for the highest volume fraction @xmath109 , however , we see that the motion of brownian particles are trapped within the effective cages formed by the surrounding particles .",
