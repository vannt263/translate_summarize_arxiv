    "for the description of nuclear collective excitations and especially giant resonances throughout the nuclear chart , the theory of choice is the random phase approximation ( rpa )  and its various siblings : the quasi - particle rpa for open - shell nuclei , the renormalized rpa , the second - order rpa ( srpa ) and of course the relativistic versions .",
    "the most primitive applications of the usual rpa  i.e. , non - relativistic , first - order , for closed - shell nuclei  consist typically of a ground - state description based on the woods - saxon potential and a phenomenological residual particle - hole ( @xmath0 ) interaction , e.g. , of landau - migdal type . an important development in the field",
    "has been the construction of increasingly refined energy functionals and corresponding interactions , with those of skyrme type dominating the landscape .",
    "these have allowed what is termed  self - consistent \" rpa calculations : the residual @xmath0 interaction is derived from the same interaction used in the hartree - fock ( hf ) description of the ground state .",
    "self - consistency ensures that certain important formal properties of the rpa solutions hold exactly , including the separation of spurious states and the preservation of sum rules .",
    "moreover , physical links between the bulk properties of nuclear matter and those of collective nuclear states can be established .",
    "the self - consistent rpa offers also enhanced predictive power : by starting from a more and more refined energy functional one wishes to make reliable extrapolations towards the unknown territories of the nuclear chart .",
    "phenomenology enters this scheme in the form of the effective two - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( nnn ) interaction .",
    "contrary to the bare nn and nnn interactions , these are tailored for the use in mean - field type calculations such as hf and rpa .",
    "an ansatz is typically made for the effective nn(n ) force and an appropriate fitting strategy has to follow .",
    "highly accurate parameterizations of the bare nn force are nowadays available  @xcite . at the same time , attempts are made to derive the nn , nnn , and many - nucleon force starting from first principles , within chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the possibility is currently being explored to combine mean - field theory with such realistic nn potentials .",
    "two methods have been developed recently for  taming \" the nn interaction and thus making it usable within models like hf and rpa : the @xmath1 low - momentum interaction is derived within renormalization group theory  @xcite and the @xmath2 correlated nn interaction is derived using the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom )  @xcite .",
    "although constructed following different formalisms , the two potentials have similar low - momentum matrix elements . in this work we focus on the ucom potential .    within the ucom ,",
    "the major short - range correlations , induced by the strong repulsive core and the tensor part of the bare nn potential , are described by a state - independent unitary correlation operator .",
    "this can be used to introduce correlations into an uncorrelated many - body state or , alternatively , to perform a similarity transformation of an operator of interest .",
    "applied to a realistic nn interaction , the method produces a  correlated \" interaction , @xmath3 , which can be used as a universal effective interaction , for calculations within simple hilbert spaces .",
    "the aim of the ucom is to treat explicitly only the state - independent short - range correlations ; long - range correlations should be described by the model space .",
    "this tells us already that the ucom - based hf is not enough , since a slater - determinant wavefunction is unable to describe correlations .",
    "it was found indeed that , although bound nuclei were obtained using the @xmath2 already at the hf level , the binding energies were underestimated by about 4  mev per nucleon . second - order perturbation theory , however , constitutes a tractable and adequate extension to the  zero - order \" description provided by hf , as far as nuclear binding energies are concerned  @xcite .    in a recent publication",
    "@xcite we employed the ucom hamiltonian in standard , self - consistent rpa calculations to study nuclear giant resonances .",
    "the ground state was described by the uncorrelated hf state , as usual .",
    "the main focus was on the isoscalar ( is ) giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) , the isovector ( iv ) giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , and the is giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) .",
    "highly collective states were indeed obtained for various closed - shell nuclei ranging from @xmath4o to @xmath5pb .",
    "we achieved a reasonable agreement with the experimental centroid energies of the is gmr .",
    "by contrast , the energies of the iv gdr and the is gqr were overestimated by several mev .    obviously , the @xmath2 is not a traditional effective interaction .",
    "partly because no long - range correlations are ( effectively ) included in the ucom , the corresponding nucleon effective mass in nuclear matter obtained in a hf calculation is very low ( less than half the bare nucleon mass ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the hf results in finite nuclei : the single - particle level density was found too low .",
    "it is also manifested by the above - mentioned rpa results on the gqr and gdr centroids . from the preceding discussion it follows that",
    ", besides the possible important role of missing three - body terms in the hamiltonian ( see sec .",
    "[ scorrh ] ) , another source of our failure to describe nuclear collective states quantitatively can be the inadequacy of the rpa method to take into account residual long - range correlations .",
    "the standard rpa is based on two assumptions which hint at possible remedies .",
    "first of all , only one - particle - one - hole excitations are taken into account .",
    "one can include higher - order configurations , starting with two - particle - two - hole within srpa .",
    "given that an extended model space is of great importance when using the @xmath2 , it is imperative to examine the effect ; work along this line is in progress .",
    "the second assumption is that one can approximate the true rpa ground state by the hf ground state .",
    "one argument follows from the fact that the rpa is the theory of small - amplitude vibrations around the hf ground state , therefore correlations should be small anyway for the use of rpa to be justified .",
    "it is not obvious that this assumption holds when the ucom hamiltonian is used , given the large correction to the hf binding energies due to second - order  @xcite and rpa  @xcite correlations .",
    "therefore , in this work we wish to examine the effect of explicit rpa ground - state correlations on our results for nuclear collective states .    to this end",
    "we use a renormalized version of the rpa , developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where excited states are built on top of the true rpa ground state .",
    "it is formulated in the single - particle basis which diagonalizes the one - body density matrix , i.e. , the natural - orbital basis , and its equations are solved iteratively .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will call it extended rpa ( erpa ) .",
    "the term has been used in the literature to describe also higher - order rpa models ( such as srpa ) , but this is not the case here .",
    "renormalized formulations of the rpa , such as the erpa , consider explicitly the depletion of the fermi sea in the ground state due to rpa correlations . besides corrected excitation properties , the erpa allows us to evaluate also corrected ground - state properties , namely single - particle energies and occupation numbers .",
    "it is derived using the number - operator method , which , contrary to the quasi - boson approximation , does not suffer from double - counting the second - order contributions  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ scorrh ] we outline the ucom method and introduce the correlated hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "[ serpa ] we present the erpa method and the formalism used to evaluate ground - state properties and transition strengths . in sec .",
    "[ sresults ] we present our results . in sec .",
    "[ ssummary ] we summarize and discuss future perspectives .",
    "in this work we employ a correlated interaction constructed within the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) , based on the argonne v18  @xcite nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction . here",
    "we outline the basic principles of the ucom scheme  @xcite .",
    "more detailed yet compact descriptions of the method can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is the explicit treatment of the interaction - induced short - range central and tensor correlations .",
    "these are imprinted into an uncorrelated many - body state @xmath6 ( e.g. , a slater determinant ) through a state - independent unitary transformation defined by the unitary correlation operator @xmath7 , resulting in a correlated state @xmath8 , @xmath9 the correlation operator @xmath7 is written as a product of unitary operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 describing tensor and central correlations , respectively . both are formulated as exponentials of a hermitian generator , @xmath12      \\exp [ -\\text{i } \\sum_{i < j } g_{r , ij } ] .\\ ] ] the construction of the two - body generators @xmath13 and @xmath14 follows the physical mechanisms by which the interaction induces central and tensor correlations .",
    "the short - range central correlations , caused by the repulsive core of the interaction , are introduced by a radial distance - dependent shift pushing nucleons apart from each other if they are within the range of the core .",
    "tensor correlations between two nucleons are generated by a spatial shift perpendicular to the radial direction .",
    "for a given bare potential , the corresponding correlation functions are determined by an energy minimization in the two - body system for each @xmath15 channel .",
    "matrix elements of an operator @xmath16 with correlated many - body states @xmath8 can be equivalently written as matrix elements of a  correlated \" ( transformed ) operator @xmath17 and uncorrelated many - body states @xmath6 , thanks to the unitarity of the correlation operator .",
    "thus , one can work in simple hilbert spaces ( simple states ) using correlated operators , as well as with bare operators and explicitly correlated states . by applying the unitary transformation to a bare nn interaction , a phase - shift equivalent correlated interaction",
    "is obtained , which is suitable for use in tractable model spaces  @xcite .",
    "the same transformation can then be applied to any other operator under study , as is needed for a consistent ucom treatment .",
    "there are a couple of important issues arising in actual applications . in an @xmath18-body system",

    ", we usually employ a two - body approximation , i.e. , three - body and higher - order terms of the expansion are neglected . starting from the uncorrelated hamiltonian @xmath22 for the @xmath18-body system , consisting of the kinetic energy operator @xmath23 and a two - body potential @xmath24 , the formalism of the ucom is used to construct the correlated hamiltonian in two - body approximation @xmath25 } + { \\tilde{t}}^{[2 ] } + { \\tilde{v}}^{[2 ] }    = t + v_{\\text{ucom}},\\ ] ] where the one - body contribution comes only from the uncorrelated kinetic energy @xmath26 } = t$ ] .",
    "two - body contributions arise from the correlated kinetic energy @xmath27}$ ] and the correlated potential @xmath28}$ ] , which together constitute the phase - shift equivalent correlated interaction @xmath2 .",
    "it has been verified that higher - order contributions due to short - range central correlations can be neglected in the description of nuclear structure properties @xcite .",
    "the tensor interaction , on the other hand , is long - ranged and thus generates long - range correlations in an isolated two - nucleon system .",
    "however , the long - range tensor correlations between two nucleons embedded in a many - nucleon system are suppressed by the presence of other nucleons , leading to a screening of the tensor correlations at large interparticle distances . in terms of the cluster expansion this screening appears through significant higher - order contributions . in order to avoid large higher - order contributions , and at the same time to effectively describe the screening effect , the range of the tensor correlation function  more precisely , the  correlation volume \" @xmath29  @xcite  is restricted during the parameterization procedure .",
    "restricting the range of the tensor correlator has another important function , namely to ensure that only state - independent , short - range correlations are described by the ucom . by varying the correlation volumes  the only parameters entering the formalism  a family of correlators and respective correlated interactions are obtained .",
    "the question is then how to optimize these parameters in order to best describe the screening effect and the separation of the two types of correlations . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be done with the help of exact few - body calculations . in particular , applications within",
    "the no - core shell model showed that for the argonne v18 potential the value @xmath30",
    "@xmath31 leads to the best description of binding energies in @xmath32h and @xmath33he . for this choice of tensor correlator range the missing genuine three - nucleon interaction and the ommitted higher - order terms of the cluster expansion of the correlated hamiltonian",
    "effectively cancel each other .",
    "as was subsequently shown within many - body perturbation theory  @xcite , and verified by rpa calculations  @xcite , this cancelation remains at work throughout the nuclear chart , as far as the binding energy is concerned .",
    "the same does not necessarily hold , however , for other ground - state observables , such as charge radii , or for excited - state properties .    in this work we will use the correlated argonne v18 potential with @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "no tensor correlator is employed in the triplet - odd channel , where the tensor interaction is much weaker .",
    "we start from a hamiltonian which consists of the intrinsic kinetic energy and the @xmath2 interaction derived from the argonne v18 potential including the coulomb potential , @xmath34 in two - body approximation .",
    "the intrinsic kinetic energy operator reads , @xmath35 where we assume equal proton and neutron masses , @xmath36 .",
    "it is the two - body hamiltonian @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hintr ] ) that has been used in hartree - fock ( hf ) , perturbation - theory , and rpa calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite and that will be employed in this work too . in practice ,",
    "two - body matrix elements in a harmonic - oscillator basis are the input to such calculations .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator basis is typically restricted to @xmath38 major shells , which warrants complete convergence of the hf results .",
    "calculations with larger basis sizes are possible but increasingly time - consuming .",
    "the optimal value of the harmonic oscillator parameter is determined from an explicit energy minimization for different regions in the nuclide chart .",
    "the method used in this work is a first - order rpa .",
    "the excited nuclear states are described as linear combinations of particle - hole ( @xmath0 ) and hole - particle ( @xmath39 ) configurations and created by a set of vibration creation operators .",
    "the rpa ground state ( reference state ) is the vacuum of the corresponding annihilation operators and contains induced long - range correlations . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sintro ] , in order to facilitate the actual solution of the rpa equations , one usually approximates the reference state by the uncorrelated hf ground state when calculating the rpa matrix elements and the transition matrix elements .",
    "here we use a renormalized formulation of the rpa that avoids this approximation and allows us not only to assess the effect of ground - state correlations on the excitation spectra , but also to evaluate some properties of the correlated rpa ground state . following ref .",
