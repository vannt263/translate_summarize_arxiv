    "the quantum percolation model exhibits anderson localization and it was reviewed e. g. in ref .",
    "we believe that it belongs to the same universality class as the anderson model , thus it undergoes no metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in 2d , i. e. all states become localized for any positive disorder @xcite and large enough samples .",
    "we will regard square , or generally hypercubic disordered samples with @xmath0 sites , coupled to perfect semi - infinite leads .",
    "@xmath1 is dimensionality .",
    "two characteristic lengths can be introduced , the mean free path @xmath2 and the localization length @xmath3 . for finite samples and small disorder , with system size",
    "@xmath4 significantly smaller than both @xmath2 and @xmath3 we get the ballistic regime and roughly for @xmath5 the ( quasi)metallic one , with mean landauer conductance @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in the localized regime @xmath8 and @xmath9 . at mit point , characterized by critical amount of disorder ,",
    "the localization length @xmath3 diverges and it remains infinite in full metal .",
    "such mit surely exists for @xmath10 . in quasi - metallic regime @xmath3",
    "is large , but finite , typically for @xmath11 .",
    "the absence of mit is known also in 2d anderson model with orthogonal symmetry , i. e. neither with magnetic field nor spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the same was numerically checked again @xcite for 2d quantum percolation . on contrary , in ref .",
    "@xcite and quite recently in a paper @xcite , mit presence at 2d quantum percolation was reported .",
    "we aim to support the former statement that no indications of mit are found when calculating the dependence of landauer conductance on system size and other model parameters numerically .    concerning experiments , in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors report direct confirmation of mit for 3d anderson model , including correct critical exponent , characterizing the divergence of @xmath3 .",
    "these measurements were performed on atomic matter waves , cooled cs atoms kicked by laser pulses .",
    "such experiment rules out problems of decoherence or many - body interactions , thus it is well described by our model .    however with real mesoscopic samples , experimenters often observe the mit on 2d structures , see e. g. the review @xcite . but",
    "even in our non - interacting , or one - electron models , switching the magnetic field or spin - orbit interaction already induces the mit in 2d .",
    "at least the metallic regime seemed to be well understood and widely accepted .",
    "however , later measurements @xcite on quasi-1d gold wires showed , than even in this regime the third cumulant of @xmath12 was non - zero , thus the distribution of conductances differs from the expected gaussian .",
    "this can be explained e. g. by electron - electron interaction .",
    "one - particle models predict single parameter scaling and gaussian distributions within the conduction band , though with possible exception of some isolated points ( energies ) .",
    "alternatively we can have to do with decoherence by inelastic scattering .",
    "metallic regime was also measured on 2d electron systems in si mosfets @xcite , two parameter scaling involved , and it was again explained by above mentioned e - e interactions .",
    "thus the single parameter scaling theory predictions , especially no mit in orthogonal 2d systems , are disputed from various sides .",
    "the non - satisfactory situation was summarized in @xcite , stating that there is no simple model capable to explain all experimental data at once .",
    "superlocalization , i. e. over - exponential decay of @xmath13 , was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite on the percolation cluster at @xmath14 and explained as a consequence of the cluster s fractal nature . here",
    "@xmath15 is the ratio of randomly removed sites and @xmath16 is the percolation threshold .",
    "we do not reach the classical 2d site percolation threshold @xmath17 .",
    "the charge careers , represented by planar quantum waves , have the energy @xmath18 .",
    "the conduction band for simple hypercubic sample with the volume @xmath0 is the interval @xmath19 .",
    "anomalous behavior , meaning non - exponential decay of @xmath20 , was reported @xcite mainly at band center , i. e. for small energy @xmath21 . in ref .",
    "@xcite thouless conductivity @xmath22 was calculated from the dependence of energy spectra on boundary conditions and a transition between two types of localization was reported even in 2d .",
    "one expected type should be sublocalization or weak localization , i. e. power - law decay of @xmath23 with negative exponent .",
    "we will test such possible behavior for landauer conductance @xmath12 and the largest @xmath4 available .",
    "in localized regime , the energy dependences of conductance have resonances , i. e. sharp peaks .",
    "they ofted reach to conducting values , i. e. @xmath24 .",
    "the nature of wave functions at resonant energies @xcite has shown that they are of pendry necklace type , i. e. a chain of comparable localized wave packets . such a quasi 1d chain enables the transmission across the sample also in higher dimensional case .",
    "pendry predicted @xcite , that even for @xmath25 the probability @xmath26 of these rare states should decay with @xmath4 as @xmath27 , a relation he derived analytically in 1d .",
    "as the main tasks , in this paper we aim to look for signs of mit or sublocalization in the whole conduction band , to test pendry s conjecture on rare events and to present the properties of the quasi - metallic regime , compared even with quantitative predictions .",
    "let us now introduce the tight - binding hamiltonian :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 numbers the @xmath30 lattice sites and the second sum goes over nearest neighbors .",
    "later we set the hopping @xmath31 in arbitrary units , thus fixing the energy scale .",
    "with box distribution of random on - site energies @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath33 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes the anderson model and @xmath34 is called disorder . for a binary system",
    "the distribution of the energies has the form :    @xmath35    where @xmath15 is the ratio of insulating sites @xmath36 and it is the measure of disorder in this model .",
    "@xmath37 is dirac s delta function .",
    "we can analyze any combination of energies @xmath38 and @xmath39 by our method , but in this paper we concentrate on the quantum percolation model . hence we set the on - site energy for a - type atoms to @xmath40 and the one for the randomly positioned b - type atoms to a large number , mostly @xmath41 . for a completely removed , inaccessible site this energy would be infinite . the difference will be discussed in the next chapter .",
    "we chose this approach in order to apply the transfer matrix method to calculate the transport properties .",
    "when we study the eigenenergies , namely their density of states ( dos ) @xmath42 , we simply set all on - site energies to zero and also the hopping elements @xmath43 for all nearest neighbors @xmath44 of the excluded sites @xmath29 .",
    "we use standard transfer matrix method for numerical calculations .",
    "the square sample is connected to two perfect semi - infinite leads .",
    "a set of @xmath4 ( generally @xmath45 ) planar waves enters the square sample from the left .",
    "they have different wavenumbers in transfer direction @xmath46 , @xmath47 , given implicitly by the dispersion relation    @xmath48    we set the lattice constant @xmath49 , thus fixing the length scale .",
    "the last term is given by hard wall boundary conditions in perpendicular direction .",
    "the real solutions for @xmath46 are called open channels and they are possible only for @xmath50 ; the complex solutions lead to exponentially damped waves - closed channels and they are omitted at the end .",
    "the part of the waves arriving on the right hand side of the sample is described by the transmission matrix @xmath51 , the rest was reflected to the left and it is described by the reflection matrix @xmath26 , both @xmath30 .",
    "the elements of the transmission matrix @xmath52 are the amplitudes of charge careers transmitting from channel @xmath53 ( on the left ) to the channel @xmath54 on the right .",
    "the conservation law has the form @xmath55 * 1 * , where * 1 * is identity matrix representing incoming waves and this is a generalized kirchhoff law .",
    "the conductance @xmath12 in units @xmath56 is calculated making use of landauer formula @xmath57 , the trace restricted to open channels .",
    "the @xmath58 transfer matrix @xmath59 relates waves on the right : vector @xmath60 of @xmath4 outgoing transmitted waves and @xmath4 ( zeros ) incoming ones , to those on the left : @xmath61 of @xmath4 incoming and @xmath4 reflected waves : @xmath62 .",
    "it can be shown to fulfill @xcite    @xmath63    the main advantage of this formulation is the possibility to cut the sample into slabs , perpendicular to the transfer direction .",
    "the @xmath4 transfer matrices of these slabs are then multiplied to get the complete @xmath59 , because outgoing waves of one slab are the incoming ones of the next slab .",
    "but we have to do with ill - defined matrices , i. e. their eigenvalues differ by many orders of magnitude for samples even much smaller than it was the case for anderson model . in other words , numerical errors , given mainly by closed channels , rise quickly with sample size . an efficient way to treat this problem was described in ref .",
    "@xcite and at the end of ref .",
    "it is based on the fact , that the upper matrices involved in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) have large eigenvalues dominating @xmath64 , but we need accurate lower eigenvalues to recover @xmath51 .",
    "thus we multiply the @xmath65 submatrices analogous to those in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) by the inverse of their top half and store the product of changes made by this to be multiplied with @xmath51 at the end . in quantum percolation , we have to perform the procedure at least after each two transfer matrix multiplications ( cca 10 in anderson model ) , but then we are able to include larger samples up to @xmath66 .",
    "the most numerically sensitive region is the anomalous one , where maximum @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "a slight drawback of our method is , that even the large chosen @xmath39 still allows small conductance @xmath12 via quantum tunneling - we can guess this value roughly by constructing a single perpendicular barrier of thickness 1 site , and calculate its @xmath69 for sample sizes around @xmath70 ( and @xmath71 ) . for two distant barriers we get @xmath72 after tunneling twice .",
    "deep insulators must be treated carefully , in order to distinguish between anderson localization and quantum tunneling .",
    "a part of our finite samples creates percolating cluster of insulating sites even for ratios of these sites @xmath73 , recall that @xmath16 is the classical site percolation threshold . in classical percolation",
    "such a sample would have zero conductivity , in our case quantum tunneling gives small non - zero conductance of above mentioned orders . neither taking these samples into account nor omitting them is fully correct",
    ". thus when we calculate @xmath12 in the localized regime , we prefer large samples and ratios @xmath15 not quite close to @xmath16 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath74 is somewhat spoiled and we will therefore use the less sensitive @xmath75 and @xmath76 , if possible . at least this is easy to test by changing @xmath39 . if the conductance changes , we have tunneling or another ( numerical ) problem .",
    "otherwise we have anderson localization and the data are plausible .     in the band center @xmath77 . ]     in the band center @xmath77 . ]",
    "at first let us describe the so called anomaly region at the center of the conduction band , i. e. for small energy @xmath21 .",
    "it is known , that @xmath77 can be a special case in these models , e. g. in 1d anderson model the wave function gains additional symmetries , ref .",
    "[ fig : gef ] shows the conductance as a function of energy , @xmath78 , for three realizations of positions for b - type sites , with the same ratio @xmath15 .",
    "we can see that , outside of the center , @xmath75 slightly increases with the number of open channels ( which itself decreases with @xmath21 ) and @xmath12 oscillates with approximately constant fluctuations .",
    "the ergodic theorem states that these fluctuations of @xmath12 are the same as those for many different samples with the same @xmath15 and @xmath18 , called statistical ensemble .",
    "we will calculate these fluctuations in the latter way .",
    "but near the band center @xmath12 quickly decreases to some random value , much smaller than @xmath12 far from center .",
    "such behavior remains in localized regime , too .",
    "this anomaly is not present in the 2d anderson model .",
    "we believe it is connected with the decreasing density of states ( dos ) @xmath42 at the band center@xcite , because the ensemble averaged dos ( @xmath79 scaled for convenience ) @xmath80 is similar to @xmath81 in metallic regime , see fig [ fig : gef ] .",
    "the lack of eigenstates reduces the transmission , though not in a trivial manner .",
    "we found that mean @xmath82 is not simply proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "an analogical graph , without dos , was published in ref .",
    "@xcite , where even an average over 100 configurations did not remove the fluctuations completely , not to speak about the anomalous decay .",
    "similar dos , with larger disorders @xmath15 , where presented in ref .",
    "the high peak at @xmath77 was removed .",
    "another interesting feature of the anomaly is the partial quantization of conductances , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pgq ] .",
    "it was already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath12 as a function of the wave number @xmath84 . here",
    "it happens at the band center , for medium disorder @xmath15 and it is especially well pronounced for smaller samples .",
    "the most typical values of @xmath12 are slightly below 2 , or 4 , etc .",
    "this means that we have 1 , or 2 conducting channel(s ) and the rest is almost negligible , as the peaks are highly asymmetric , practically no 2 + , or 4 + conductances . for larger @xmath12 the peaks",
    "are shifted to lower values ( lower than 6 , 8) and suppressed , again as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the quantization disappears in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "accordingly in our case both for larger @xmath21 and/or @xmath4 this quantization is gradually smeared out .",
    "closer inspection of samples shows that these conducting channels are not trivially connected to existing straight lines of conducting sites across the sample , because `` pathways '' with short detours can also give @xmath85 and others can have very small @xmath12 .",
    "there is no smooth change of @xmath86 with one maximum from gaussian distribution in metal to deformed log - normal distribution in the insulator , as it is the case far from band center , fig .",
    "[ fig : pg ] , and for the anderson model . instead a part of samples enters these quantized peaks and the others enter the clearly separated peak of localized samples close to @xmath87 .",
    "with larger @xmath4 more samples become localized and less samples remain quantized , regardless of ( fixed ) @xmath15 .",
    "we found no critical @xmath88 , that would be @xmath4 independent .",
    "this is why we are convinced that there is no mit even at @xmath77 and the discontinuous behavior of conductances could have lead some authors to different statements , e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite .     for insulator .",
    "]    further let us address the problem of resonances , manifest in the deeply localized regime in the whole conduction band . for smaller samples we get the well known resonance peaks with relatively high amplitudes yielding maxima close to the value @xmath89 , see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we present @xmath78 semilogarithmically on a small interval of @xmath18 with several typical peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] , the maxima being roughly lorentzians .",
    "we often get a coupled minimum - maximum pair , apparent in @xmath90 plot .",
    "these line shapes are somewhat reminiscent of those from azbel - kaner @xcite cyclotron resonance , e. g. ref . @xcite ; just the latter are for @xmath12 instead of @xmath91 .",
    "of course , we have no successive maxima @xmath92 , as we have no magnetic field and the similarity is probably occasional .",
    "there are also few isolated minima , even deeper than the paired ones .",
    "the minima where not reported yet , as they are not very apparent in linear scale .",
    "the values of global maxima are slightly below 2 , say @xmath93 , in analogy to the quantization in the anomalous region .",
    "this means that we have one open channel , almost perfectly conducting at special tuned energy and the contribution of other channels can be neglected at maxima .",
    "calculating an ensemble of @xmath94 samples with fixed @xmath18 and @xmath15 up to 0.4 , virtually never gives conducting samples . nevertheless performing a rough energy scan of one sample and then tuning the @xmath18 of chosen maximum up to 9 digits allows to find them already within few samples - this is a much more effective strategy for finding these rare events .",
    "contrary to anomalous quantization we never see @xmath95 , i. e. two channels tuned to same @xmath18 .",
    "the peaks are homogeneously spread along the whole conduction band .    now let us switch to more common strategy of statistical emnsembles .",

    "<S> special attention is given to the region close to the conduction band center , but even there the anderson localization persists , without signs of metal - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> we found standard localization for sufficiently large samples . for smaller systems , novel partial quantization of landauer conductances , i. e. most values close to small integers in arbitrary units </S>",
    "<S> is observed at band center . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover types of conductance distributions ( outside the band center ) are found to be similar to systems with corrugated surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> universal conductance fluctuations in metallic regime are shown to approach the known , theoretically predicted value . </S>",
    "<S> the resonances in localized regime are pendry necklaces . </S>",
    "<S> we tested pendry s conjecture on the probability of such rare conducting samples and it proved consistent with our numerical results . </S>"
