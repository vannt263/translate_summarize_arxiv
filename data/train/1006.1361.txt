    "entanglement is one of the strangest features of quantum mechanics .",
    "few would disagree that it distinguishes quantum mechanics unequivocally from classical physics .",
    "while it has played an essential role in the understanding of quantum mechanics , paradoxically it has been mostly absent from the theory of quantum phase transitions . as in the case of classical critical phenomena , the theory of a quantum phase transition is naturally based on the description of the scaling behavior of local observables .",
    "indeed , much of the theory of quantum criticality is based on this extension of the framework of classical criticality allowing for the natural dynamics specified by the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of the system.@xcite in this standard description the main effect of quantum mechanics is captured by the dynamic critical exponent associated @xmath4 that governs the relative scaling of space and time and is determined by the dynamics of the quantum system .",
    "it is a major theoretical challenge is to understand the role of observables that have no classical analogue in quantum criticality .",
    "quantum entanglement has been proposed as a candidate for such a measure.@xcite    while there are other measures of entanglement , the entanglement entropy has proven to be the most tractable analytically and simple to define .",
    "one begins with a pure state of a bipartite quantum system @xmath5 . by restricting oneself to observing either @xmath6 or @xmath7 subregion ,",
    "the subsystem is described by a mixed state with a non - trivial reduced density matrix .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is the observed region so that the degrees of freedom in @xmath7 are traced out .",
    "the reduced density matrix is @xmath8 .",
    "non - local quantum correlations are then encoded in the von neumann entropy , @xmath9 . for the case of a total system @xmath10 in a system in a pure state ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is symmetric @xmath11 so that @xmath12 should only depend on common properties of the two regions .",
    "given the non - local character of the entanglement entropy , its behavior in extended systems and quantum fields theories has a strong geometric flavor .",
    "an important early was the realization that in systems away from quantum criticality in @xmath13 space dimensions , systems dominated by short distance physics , the von neumann entanglement entropy scales as the _ area _ of the observed region , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the linear size of the region ( say @xmath6 ) and @xmath16 is a non - universal constant.@xcite    the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy has been studied extensively in 1d quantum critical systems and it is by now reasonably well understood .",
    "such systems are effectively relativistic ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 dimensional conformal field theories ( cft ) .",
    "it has been shown that in 1d the entanglement entropy of a subsystem @xmath6 of linear size @xmath15 of an otherwise infinite system ( _ i.e. _ of linear size @xmath19 ) obeys a logarithmic scaling law,@xcite @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the central charge of the cft , and @xmath22 is the short distance cutoff .",
    "the growing popularity of entanglement entropy study is due to the fact that many universal properties of quantum systems like the central charge , excitation spectra or boundary entropy can be extracted from the entanglement entropy without the need to specify an observable : all that is needed is a consistent partition of the system .",
    "in addition , the _ dynamical _ entanglement entropy , entanglement generated in a quantum quench , has also been studied recently for a number of one - dimensional quantum critical systems.@xcite even in strongly disordered quantum systems , which do not have a local order parameter such as random spin chains at infinite disorder fixed points@xcite as well as at the anderson transition and quantum hall plateau transition,@xcite the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy has been shown to be a faithful measure of quantum criticality .",
    "however , much less is known about the scaling of entanglement in spatial dimensions @xmath23 , and how it relates to the scaling properties of local observable . while the leading scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy is the area law ,",
    "its prefactor is not universal , except in @xmath24 where the area law becomes the universal logarithmic scaling .",
    "for @xmath23 the only universal contributions may only arise from sub - leading terms ( relative to the area law ) .",
    "the study of these universal corrections requires more detailed and subtle calculations .",
    "in general the situation is not as clear .",
    "an exception is the special case of _ topological phases _ in @xmath25 , where there is a finite , i.e. @xmath26 , universal correction to the area law which is given in terms of the topological invariants of the effective topological field theory of the phase .",
    "@xcite recent work has showed that several quantum critical systems in @xmath25 do not have logarithmic sub - leading corrections and , instead , have a _ universal _",
    "finite term.@xcite    in this paper we reexamine the scaling behavior of entanglement in a special class of quantum ( multi)critical points in @xmath25 with dynamic scaling exponent @xmath27 .",
    "these conformal quantum critical points have the special property that the amplitudes of field configurations @xmath28 in their wave functions have local scale - invariant weights.@xcite simple examples of such systems are 2d quantum dimer models@xcite and their generalizations.@xcite the norm of these ground state wavefunctions is thus equivalent to a partition function of a suitable two dimensional classical statistical model at criticality . labeling a configuration of the classical statistical model by the field @xmath29 , this can be expressed , @xmath30 with the explicit form of the wavefunction , one can compute the entanglement entropy by constructing the replicated reduced density matrix , @xmath31 . for these models",
    "it was shown that the entanglement entropy has a universal sub - leading correction , @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 for the case of the quantum dimer models at their quantum critical ( rokhsar - kivelson ) point . here",
    "@xmath3 is the compactification radius ( see below ) of the coarse - grained height model , dual to the qdm , the quantum lifshitz model.@xcite the same scaling behavior has been shown to hold , within the @xmath34-expansion , in relativistic @xmath35 quantum field theory , the prototype of a quantum phase transition.@xcite    in ref.@xcite it was shown that the computation of the `` spectral moment '' of the reduced density matrix @xmath36 for the case of local scale - invariant wave functions is the same as the computation of a ratio in which the numerator is given by a classical partition function of the form of eq . for @xmath1 copies of the system which are required to agree on the boundary of region @xmath6 , while in the denominator no such constraint is imposed .",
    "posed in this way , the computation of @xmath37 , and the von neumann entanglement entropy @xmath38 , is a problem in a `` replicated '' classical 2d critical systems with a `` conformal defect '' along some curve,@xcite i.e a problem in boundary ( euclidean ) conformal field theory ( bcft ) on a somewhat unusual manifold .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath37 with sub - system size is then not as surprising as it is strongly reminiscent of the finite - size scaling of the free energy in large finite critical systems.@xcite on the other hand , it is known that the structure of the cft strongly determines its possible allowed bcfts .",
    "thus , the structure of the cft that underlies these scale invariant wave functions must similarly play a key role in the behavior of the entropies @xmath37 .",
    "this natural relation of the entanglement entropy with boundary ( or surface ) critical behavior on a suitably defined manifold appears naturally in the path integral formulation.@xcite    in this work we use bcft methods to reexamine this problem for the case of the quantum lifshitz wave function studied before in refs.@xcite paying close attention to the role of the compactification radius @xmath3 by constructing explicitly the boundary states of the associated bcft.@xcite here we show that in the limit of a large aspect ratio , @xmath39 ( where @xmath22 is the short - distance cutoff and @xmath40 is the linear size of the full system ) the entanglement entropy has the universal finite term @xmath33 , in agreement with the previous result of ref.@xcite .    on the other hand , numerical estimates of the sub - leading corrections of the scaling of the entanglement entropy in the 2d qdm , obtained using the wave function of the lattice model and using extrapolation methods",
    ", suggested that there may be additional universal contributions to @xmath0.@xcite these authors attribute the apparent disparity to the boundary conditions used in refs.@xcite .",
    "this motivated us to reexamine the bcft of this problem and to give an explicit form of the boundary states .",
    "in bcft , boundary conditions are in one to one correspondence with the primaries of the bulk cft.@xcite for the case of multiple copies at hand here the bulk cft possesses additional symmetries .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions along a specified curve , a `` conformal defect , '' reduces these symmetries .",
    "a similar situation occurs when considering defect lines in the ising model.@xcite    a better understanding of systems of @xmath1-coupled critical systems is also crucial for reasons outside the entanglement entropy . from a broader viewpoint ,",
    "a familiar condensed matter context are defects in lattice models . as mentioned earlier , one such example are defect lines in the ising model.@xcite more generally , conformal defects are very hard to classify . even for two copies of a free bosonic theory , central charge @xmath41 ,",
    "the complete classification remains elusive.@xcite theoretically , the classification of such defects is an important issue .",
    "these represent fixed points of a bcft .",
    "a familiar example is the @xmath42-channel kondo problem.@xcite more complicated examples of @xmath1 intersecting theories also appear in a more applied context .",
    "the intersection of multiple quantum wires at the same point is one example.@xcite as mentioned earlier , systems of @xmath1-coupled degrees of freedom also make their appearance in the theory of quantum brownian motion@xcite and in the dissipative hofstadter model.@xcite in this work , we add the entanglement entropy in conformal quantum critical points to this list .",
    "we compute the quantity @xmath31 in terms of the original degrees of freedom and show that there is no additional factor as suggested by ref.@xcite . while our result agrees with our previous work , we note that this happens only in the asymptotic limit of a long cylinder and that for finite sized systems , there is generically a non - trivial @xmath1-dependence .",
    "to arrive at these conclusions , we identify a new boundary state describing the boundary condition that @xmath1 copies of a system are stitched together at an interface , and we argue that additional sub - leading corrections to eq.([eq : sqcp ] ) are a result of differing boundary conditions used .",
    "we show that the correct boundary condition for the original degrees of freedom is one where the extra factor vanishes .",
    "this turns out to correspond to a subclass of conformal defects , at the common boundary .",
    "in addition , we show that there is a geometrical interpretation to @xmath31 as the ratio of classical partition functions defined on different tori , and that the universal sub - leading term is the `` thin torus limit '' of this ratio . with an explicit calculation",
    ", we find analytically that in the @xmath43 the entanglement spectrum is given by the characters of the underlying conformal field theory describing the ground state wavefunction .",
    "this provides a case where it is possible to verify analytically the conjecture of li and haldane.@xcite finally , we demonstrate that in a string theory language , it is possible to think of the common boundary condition as a brane with a background gauge field and that @xmath31 is the expectation value of an appropriately defined vertex operator ( in the `` target space '' not in the cft of the world - sheet ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we review the construction of @xmath31 for conformal quantum critical models .",
    "we then specialize to the quantum dimer model in section [ sec : qdm ] with the bulk of the calculation in sec [ sec : calc ] .",
    "a brief review of boundary conformal field theory in [ sec : bcft ] is given as it plays a central role in the main calculation . using the explicit expression for @xmath31",
    "we show in section [ sec : es ] that the entanglement spectrum has a level degeneracy indicative of the underlying conformal field theory describing the ground state wavefunction . in section [ sec : disc ]",
    "we relate the boundary condition to a brane with a specific magnetic and electric fields and show that @xmath31 can be computed as the expectation value of a vertex operator .",
    "* note added to the text : * while this paper was being refereed , we received a preprint by oshikawa @xcite and became aware of a number of inconsistencies in our treatment of the boundary state .",
    "in particular , it was pointed out that our glueing condition violated a permutation symmetry in the problem .",
    "these corrections and its consequences are noted in section [ sec : note ] .",

    "formally , the trace over @xmath1 copies of the reduced density matrix can be written as the ratio of the partition functions in these two limits , @xmath57 the theoretical challenge is to compute this ratio .",
    "various formal mathematical devices have been devised , but until now a direct approach has been lacking .",

    "we introduce a field @xmath180 localized at the boundary , @xmath181 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{2}x \\ , \\ ,   \\sum_{i=1}^{2n } \\left ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\phi^{i } \\right)^{2 } -   \\oint dt \\ , a_{i } \\partial_{t } \\phi^{i}.\\ ] ] where @xmath182 is an antisymmetric matrix we define below .",
    "formally , this action describes the `` dissipative hofstadter model '' @xcite ( with vanishing potential ) . upon varying the action ,",
    "the fields @xmath183 are found to obey the usual wave equation with the boundary condition , @xmath184 if @xmath182 is a constant matrix , independent of @xmath183 , and anti - symmetric , then clearly @xmath185 .",
    "one can think of @xmath182 as the 2-form field strength tensor associated with a gauge field @xmath186 .",
    "now , letting @xmath182 be the @xmath187 matrix , @xmath188 it is readily seen that eq.([eqn : bcf ] ) yields the desired boundary conditions at the common boundary for the scalar fields by a suitable choice of the @xmath189 matrix @xmath190 .",
    "this construction can be used to represent both the numerator and denominator of eq . by the choices ( in this basis ) @xmath191 for @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively .",
    "previously , a matrix was given for @xmath192 that violated the permutation symmetry present in the boundary condition .",
    "summing over possible glueing conditions yields the matrix above .",
    "the matrix @xmath192 is then identical to the matrix @xmath193 ( see equation ( [ eqn : matrix ] ) ) of oshikawa @xcite up to an overall unimportant sign .    in analogy with electromagnetism",
    ", there is a electric and magnetic field at the boundary @xmath194 that mediates the interaction between the @xmath80-dimensional systems . in terms of quantum",
    "brownian motion,@xcite one can regard the problem as a particle at @xmath194 on a @xmath80-dimensional space moving in a electric and magnetic field . as an open string",
    ", one sees that the boundary can be thought of as a brane carrying a magnetic and electric field.@xcite the analogy also gives a possible interpretation of the result obtained by ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of quantum brownian motion in @xmath1-dimensions",
    ", it has been shown that there is a plethora of possible boundary states where @xmath124 is non - trivial .",
    "these boundary states correspond to a different electromagnetic field and hence a different coupling of the replicas in our picture .",
    "we have thus constructed a gauge field ( and associated 2-form ) that describe the boundary interaction .",
    "one can go further by rewriting @xmath31 in the suggestive form @xmath195 where @xmath196 corresponds to the choice @xmath197 and @xmath198 to @xmath199 ( both defined above ) .",
    "the universal sub - leading correction to the entanglement entropy is the asymptotic behavior of this correlation function . in string theory , such objects",
    "are generically called vertex operators.@xcite this operator can be understood as counting a topological charge @xmath200 where the field @xmath183 is a map , @xmath201 .",
    "integrating by parts yields the correct boundary field .",
    "importantly , there exists a basis of the field @xmath202 where @xmath182 is an @xmath1-block diagonal matrix of anti - symmetric @xmath203 tensors .",
    "@xmath183 can then be written as a tensor product of maps @xmath204 and @xmath205 can be thought of as a product of holonomies characterized by the homotopy group @xmath206 .",
    "an interesting observation is that the gauge field @xmath186 is fixed by the free part of the action of eq.([eqn : gauged ] ) so that a perturbation that brings the system into a topological phase , e.g. @xmath207 has no effect on the boundary condition and hence @xmath186 remains the same .",
    "we expect that this correlation function , and hence the entanglement entropy , should take different values in the different phases .",
    "while this paper was being put into production , we received a preprint by oshikawa @xcite and we became aware of a number of inconsistencies in our previous work .",
    "in particular , the matrix used to described the coupled boundary condition did not possess the full permutation symmetry of the problem and the winding and momentum quantum numbers of the zero modes were not treated correctly . as noted by oshikawa , @xcite there is a permutation symmetry in the problem and each copy and definition of region a and b are interchangeable .",
    "one should then sum over all possible combinations of matrices @xmath208 , where @xmath208 is a shift matrix .",
    "the glueing condition is then , @xmath209 the resulting matrix @xmath193 is in fact the matrix @xmath193 given by oshikawa @xcite up to an overall unimportant sign .",
    "explicitly , @xmath210    using the sum of all possible glueing conditions because of the permutation symmetry , the partition function ( [ eqn : zinfty ] ) is given by the expression found by oshikawa @xcite .",
    "@xmath211 here , @xmath110 is a lattice that satisfies the boundary condition on the zero modes , @xmath98 the result for @xmath116 is unchanged and given by equation ( [ eqn : zzero ] ) . as pointed out by oshikawa @xcite ,",
    "the correction normalization is , @xmath212 the universal subleading term to the entanglement entropy is dependent on this ratio of @xmath89-factors so that the result ( [ eqn : result3 ] ) is now @xmath213    several results in the paper are modified because of this . in particular , the quantity @xmath31 ( i.e. equation ( [ eqn : result1 ] ) ) is now given by @xmath214 then in the limit @xmath215 one finds that the distribution of eigenvalues of the rnyi entropy for large moments @xmath1 , is given by @xmath216 where @xmath150 is the partition of integers and @xmath149 include subleading constant terms .",
    "eigenvalues are distributed according the level counting for the free @xmath127 boson theory that describes the ground state wavefunction , as mentioned in the body of the paper .",
    "before concluding with broader and more speculative issues , we summarize our results for the quantum dimer model .",
    "we found that in the limit @xmath217 , @xmath31 is given by the expression of eq.([eqn : corr ] ) .",
    "this was done in terms of the original degrees of freedom and it is hoped that this clarifies what boundary condition must be used at the common interface . in the limit @xmath218 of @xmath219 , it was found that the universal finite part of the entanglement entropy is @xmath220 this result coincides with the numerical result . @xcite",
    "we found that for finite sized systems , there is a non - trivial @xmath1-dependence , not reflected in the construction of fradkin and moore.@xcite the source of this difference laid in the subtle details of defect lines in critical systems . in this work",
    ", we showed that the boundary condition is not described by the same notion of dirichlet boundary conditions as in the original system .",
    "we circumvented the difficulties here by working directly with the original degrees of freedom .    by considering the original degrees of freedom",
    ", we further demonstrated that in the limit @xmath43 , @xmath31 has a distribution of eigenvalues characterized by the correct underlying conformal field theory of the ground state wavefunction , confirming , at least for this case , a conjecture put forth by li and haldane.@xcite attempting to understand where the universal corrections to entanglement entropy come from , we related the problem formally to work done on quantum brownian motion and branes with a background electromagnetic field , and showed that @xmath31 can be understood as an expectation value of a vertex operator .    in this work we focused on the quantum dimer model , _",
    "i.e. _ models where the norm of the ground state wavefunction is related to the free gaussian field theory , but the methods can be readily extended to different conformal quantum critical models .",
    "it would be interesting to see if a similar structure exists for more complicated systems , such as non trivial topological theories with non - abelian excitations.@xcite for some simple cases , an exact solution is possible.@xcite    we thank paul fendley , duncan haldane , vincent pasquier , and jean - mare stphan for discussions .",
    "we especially thank masaki oshikawa for sending us his pre - print and discussing his results with us .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation grant dmr 0758462 at the university of illinois .",
    "to exploit conformal invariance , it is useful to think of the system as being on a cylinder with circumference @xmath221 and length @xmath15 with boundary conditions @xmath222 on the field on the left and right ends of the system respectively .",
    "quantum mechanically , this corresponds to evolving a one dimensional system defined on the line @xmath171 in time @xmath221 .",
    "the partition function is given by the usual expression , @xmath223    if the hamiltonian possess conformal invariance , then one knows that time and space can be interchanged , @xmath224 or equivalently , the system is invariant under the modular transformation @xmath12 .",
    "one now has a cylinder which is wrapped around in the spatial direction and extending upward in time .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian in this picture can be regarded as propagating the system for the time interval @xmath15 from the initial and final state @xmath225 @xmath226 the states here belong to the hilbert space of states quantized on the circle , _",
    "i.e. _ they can be decomposed into linear combinations of states in the representation of the virasoro algebra which are labelled by @xmath227 , the highest weights .",
    "@xcite    because conformal invariance is so restrictive in two dimensions , one can say more about the boundary states @xmath228 .",
    "one typically imposes the condition that @xmath229 where @xmath230 are the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic components of the stress energy tensor , @xmath231 . in the @xmath232 basis , this means that the diagonal components of the stress energy tensor vanish at the boundary @xmath233 . if the boundary is in the time direction , this means no momentum flows out of the system .",
    "the stress energy generates the conformal symmetry so that the boundary states must satisfy the condition , @xmath234 \\vert a \\rangle = 0 \\label{eqn : cfbc } .\\ ] ] fourier transforming , this can be written in terms of virasoro generators , @xmath235 \\vert a \\rangle = 0 .\\ ] ] this implies that the boundary state @xmath236 must made out of states with the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors stitched together in a specific way , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath237 here , @xmath238 labels the descendant level in the representation @xmath239 that belongs to the subset of representations that appear simultaneously in the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors of the virasoro algebra .",
    "the state @xmath240 are known as the ishibashi states.@xcite    the ishibashi states turn out to form a basis for the possible boundary states , and one can write an arbitrary state @xmath236 as a linear combination of the ishibashi states , @xmath241 hence , the characterization of a conformal boundary condition is reduced to finding the matrix elements @xmath242 .",
    "now , using the expression ( [ eqn : bstate ] ) into ( [ eqn : cstring ] ) one finds that @xmath243 the overlap can be identified with the character of the representation @xmath53 , @xmath244 . now noting that ( [ eqn : ostring ] ) can be written as a sum of characters , and using the fact that the two quantities are in fact equivalent by conformal invariance leads one to the relationship @xmath245 where @xmath246 are the multiplicities that indicate the number of times a representation @xmath53 appears in the hilbert space with boundary conditions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one then notes that the characters transform among themselves by the modular @xmath12-matrix so that @xmath247 if the characters are linearly independent , then this leads one to cardy s equation which relates the multiplicities @xmath246 that characterize the spectrum of the theory for fixed boundary conditions @xmath222 and the matrix elements @xmath242 that characterize the boundary states , @xmath248 the key problem in boundary conformal field theory is finding a set of boundary states where the multiplicities are non - negative integers.@xcite for the free boson , a solution to this requirement is @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath68 are defined in ( [ eqn : zeromode ] ) .    note that linear combinations of boundary states @xmath236 also satisfy the above constraints .",
    "an additional choice that is imposed is that @xmath251 , that is to say that the identity representation appears exactly once in the spectrum of the theory with @xmath252 boundary conditions .",
    "operatively , this fixes the normalization of the boundary states so that in the long cylinder limit @xmath253 contains the identity exactly once .",
    "this gives the @xmath89-factor of the boundary state,@xcite @xmath254 it has been conjectured that relevant boundary perturbations drive the system to fixed points given by lower values of the @xmath89-factor.@xcite in this sense , the @xmath89-factor is also a characteristic of the boundary condition .",
