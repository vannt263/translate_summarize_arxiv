    "the emission of @xmath0-delayed neutrons by neutron - rich nuclei significantly influences @xcite the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the rapid ( r- ) neutron - capture process  @xcite .",
    "this decay mechanism competes with the @xmath0 decay of r - process nuclei towards the valley of stability and serves as an additional source of neutrons in late stages of the r - process  @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath0-delayed neutron emission probabilities ( @xmath1 ) are needed for reliable r - process model calculations , and to test the astrophysical assumptions in various r - process models by comparing their final abundance predictions with observations .",
    "from a nuclear - structure point of view , the @xmath1 value provides model constraints at low beam intensities where @xmath2-spectroscopy is difficult . the @xmath1 value probes @xmath0-decay strength at excitation energies slightly above the neutron threshold .",
    "it therefore provides nuclear structure information complementary to @xmath0-decay , which often favors low energy @xmath0-decay strength owing to the larger phase space ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath1 requires the measurement of @xmath0-delayed neutrons in coincidence with the @xmath0 particles emitted from the nucleus of interest .",
    "this is particularly challenging for nuclei near or at the r - process path due to their very low production rates and the relatively short half - lives  of the order of 10100 milliseconds .",
    "experiments performed at isol - type facilities have successfully exploited the use of neutron long counters ( nlc )  @xcite to measure @xmath1 values of neutron - rich nuclei ( see , for instance , the compilations of refs .",
    "nlcs generally consist of a series of gas proportional counters embedded into a moderator block used to thermalize the neutrons prior to their detection .",
    "performance requirements include a high detection efficiency for neutron energies ranging from a few kev to @xmath31  mev . because the detector does not measure the energy of individual neutrons , variations of the efficiency as a function of energy have to be minimized as much as possible as they otherwise can translate into uncertainties in the measured @xmath1 .",
    "our goal was to keep detector induced systematic uncertainties well below the 10% level .",
    "measurements at that level of accuracy are a dramatic improvement over theoretical predictions , and ensure that other uncertainties dominate astrophysical and nuclear structure models . with systematic errors at that level , statistical errors will tend to dominate in practice , as the most interesting isotopes will typically be produced at rather low rates .",
    "we report here the development of nero , a new nlc at national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) suitable for use with fast radioactive beams produced by in - flight fragmentation .",
    "this technique provides exotic beams without some of the limitations induced by chemistry - based target - extraction techniques .",
    "the short time required to transport , separate , and identify the produced fragments , typically less than few hundred ns , makes it possible to study the very short - lived nuclei in the r - process .",
    "the fragments of interest are implanted in an active catcher that is part of the nscl beta counting system ( bcs ) .",
    "implantation of a fragment and emitted @xmath0 particles are detected event - by - event .",
    "the correlation of decays with a previously implanted nucleus requires large area highly pixelated catchers , typically double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dssds ) .",
    "the challenge in the design of nero was to include a large cylindrical cavity capable of accommodating such a system , while still fulfilling the performance requirements for the detection efficiency .",
    "the final design was inspired by existing nlc detectors such as the mainz neutron detector  @xcite .",
    "the detector system consists of a 60@xmath460@xmath480  @xmath5 polyethylene matrix ( density 0.93(1 )  g/@xmath5 ) with its long symmetry axis aligned with the beam . along the beam axis",
    ", the matrix has a cylindrical cavity with a diameter of 22.8  cm to accommodate the bcs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nero ] , left ) .",
    "nero includes three different types of cylindrical proportional counters manufactured by reuter - stokes : filled with @xmath6he ( models rs - p4 - 0814 - 207 and rs - p4 - 0810 - 104 ) , and filled with bf@xmath7 ( model rs - p1 - 1620 - 205 ) ( see tab .  [ tabcounters ] for details ) .",
    "sixty of these detectors are arranged in three concentric rings around the central symmetry axis , allowing for a nearly 4@xmath8 solid angle coverage around the implantation detector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nero ] , right ) .",
    "the optimum detector configuration was found using the mcnp code  @xcite to calculate the neutron - detection efficiency for different geometries , moderating materials , and number and arrangement of various types of proportional counters .",
    "interactions of neutrons with the different detector materials were calculated , using the endf / b - vi  @xcite cross - sections in the energy range 10@xmath9  ev to 20  mev .",
    "the influence of different environments such as laboratory floor and wall configurations were investigated but were found to be negligible . according to these calculations , most of the neutrons emitted from the center of nero are detected in the innermost ring . therefore , sixteen of the more compact and efficient @xmath6he",
    "gas - filled proportional counters are mounted in the innermost ring at a radius of 13.6  cm .",
    "for the middle and outer rings at radii of 19.2  cm and 24.8  cm we use twenty and twenty - four bf@xmath7 proportional counters , respectively .",
    "the bf@xmath7 counters are longer allowing one to cover more solid angle , and their efficiency just compensates the decreasing efficiency of the inner ring with increasing neutron energy .        to facilitate transportation and assembly ,",
    "the polyethylene block is divided into an upper and lower half , and each half is subdivided in six equal parts along the longest symmetry axis .",
    "the twelve pieces are held together with eight stainless steel bolts .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : effreactions ]      in order to evaluate the energy - dependence of the efficiency , the energy spectrum of the emitted neutrons needs to be known for each reaction used .",

    ". however , the corresponding laboratory frame neutron energy @xmath11 depends on the center - of - mass polar angle @xmath12 of the emitted neutron with respect to the beam axis .",

    "this uncertainty can be reduced if the neutron energies @xmath11 can be constrained from experiment or theory .",
    "one limitation for the measurement of @xmath1 , particularly for very exotic nuclei , is the neutron background rate ( @xmath48 ) .",
