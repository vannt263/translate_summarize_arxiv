    "since the 1960 s , when the concept of uniform hyperbolicity was coined by smale in  @xcite , a relevant question in dynamical systems is to construct examples that exhibit the hyperbolic features described by the theory .",
    "in fact , hunt and mackay  @xcite proved that uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems , among which smale s horseshoe is a paradigmatic example , arise naturally in physical systems . on other direction , simple one - dimensional examples arising from populational dynamics led to consider the quadratic family @xmath0 , or equivalently @xmath1 , that despite the simple formulation presents very rich and complex dynamics .",
    "in fact , it follows from pioneering works by jakobson , benedicks and carleson  @xcite that there exists a positive lebesgue measure set @xmath2 $ ] such that @xmath1 has an absolutely continuous ergodic probability measure with positive lyapunov exponent for all @xmath3 , ie , is non - uniformly hyperbolic .",
    "later , graczyk and wiatek  @xcite and lyubich  @xcite proved that @xmath4 is hyperbolic for an open and dense set of parameters @xmath5 $ ] .    much more recently ,",
    "in a major breakthrough , in  @xcite kozlovski , shen and van strien proved that hyperbolicity is open and dense among @xmath6 maps of the interval or the circle @xmath7 .",
    "in particular this shows that although persistent , meaning a positive lebesgue measure phenomenon for parametrized families , one - dimensional examples with robust non - uniform hyperbolicity do not exist .    in a higher dimensional",
    "setting the existence of robust non - uniform hyperbolicity was addressed by viana  @xcite that introduced a class of @xmath8-maps of the cyclinder : they are any small @xmath8-perturbations @xmath9 of the skew - product transformations @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an expanding map of the unit circle @xmath12 with @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 for some small @xmath16 and parameter @xmath17 $ ] such that the quadratic map @xmath18 is of misiurewicz type . despite the presence of a critical region , viana proved that this class of transformations of the cylinder @xmath19 have positive lyapunov exponents in every direction , that is @xmath20 for lebesgue almost every @xmath21 and all @xmath22 . building over this , alves  @xcite proved that there is a unique @xmath9-invariant probability measure absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue .",
    "in other words , this class of @xmath8-endomorphisms of the cylinder present a robust non - uniform hyperbolicity phenomenon .",
    "more recent contributions and extensions include the ones by gouzel @xcite on the skew products with curve of neutral fixed points , by buzzi , sester and tsujii  @xcite for @xmath23-perturbations of the skew product @xmath24 with a weaker condition @xmath25 and later on by schnellmann  @xcite that considered @xmath26-transformations and by schnellmann , gao , shen  @xcite considering misiurewicz - thurston quadratic maps as the base dynamics . in these results the proof that lebesgue almost every point has only positive lyapunov exponents exploits , in the spirit of @xcite , some weak hyperbolicity condition , namely dominated decomposition .",
    "an important challenge in dynamics is to construct multidimensional attractors with critical behaviour without dominated splittings but persistence of positive lyapunov exponents in parameter space .",
    "it was proposed by bonatti , daz and viana in  @xcite that such phenomena might occur in a parametrized family @xmath27 .",
    "as mentioned above , important contributions were given in @xcite where the authors proved non - uniform expansion for skew - product of quadratic maps over a misiurewicz - thurston quadratic map .",
    "since parameters corresponding to misiurewicz - thurston quadratic maps have zero lebesgue measure in the parameter space then the previous question remains open .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to study a class of quadratic skew - products over a markov expanding map of the interval with at most countably many inverse branches : skew - products @xmath28 with @xmath11 piecewise expanding markov map of the unit interval and @xmath15 for some small @xmath16 and parameter @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "one important motivation to consider skew products of quadratic maps over expanding dynamics with infinitely many branches is to understand if the technique of inducing can be an useful approach to the previous question since non - uniform expansion is well known to be related with inducing schemes leading to piecewise expanding maps with infinitely many branches .",
    "we prove that the behaviour of this class of transformations has different behaviours depending on the parameter @xmath29 .    in the one hand ,",
    "if @xmath18 is a misiurewicz quadratic map then we overcome the difficulty caused by the presence of critical points and infinitely many invertibility branches to prove the existence of two positive lyapunov exponents at lebesgue almost every point , that there exists a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure and that it satisfies good statistical properties .",
    "moreover , we also prove that generically such transformations admit the coexistence of the full lebesgue measure set of points which have only positive lyapunov exponents together with a dense set of points with one positive and one negative lyapunov exponents , a fact that was unkown even in the context of viana maps in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the quadratic map @xmath18 is hyperbolic then the skew product @xmath24 admits an hyperbolic srb measure , provided that @xmath30 is small .",
    "in fact this will be consequence of a more result for fibered hyperbolic polynomials .    the difficulties in proving our results are substantially different depending if one is considers perturbations of a misiurewicz or a hyperbolic quadratic map .",
    "in the first case , the strategy of @xcite for the positivity of lyapunov exponents lebesgue almost everywhere is to consider the iteration of admissible curves ( a class of curves preserved under iteration ) and to prove that lebesgue almost every point in each admissible curve has a slow recurrence condition to the critical region and thus has exponential growth of the derivative",
    ". the key combinatorial argument in @xcite does not hold in our setting since any admissible curve is mapped onto countably many of them . in our proposition",
    "[ prop : main1 ] we overcome this difficulty and obtain a statistical argument showing that , up to consider a finite iteration @xmath31 of the skew - product @xmath9 , the proportion of points in any admissible curve whose iterate intersects a small neighborhood of the critical region is bounded by the lebesgue measure of the corresponding neighborhood .",
    "then , a large deviations argument shows that the measure of points in admissible curves that exhibit fast recurrence to a neighborhood of the critical region decrease subexponentially and , consequently , lebesgue almost every point has two positive lyapunov exponents . in the second case ,",
    "corresponding to perturbation of hyperbolic quadratic maps , the problem can be understood as a random composition of nearby quadratic maps and so we consider a more general setting of fibered nearby hyperbolic interval maps .",
    "the hyperbolicity of the julia set for fibered polynomial maps in the complex variable setting has been studied by jonsson  @xcite and sester  @xcite .",
    "here we use a small neighborhood of the periodic atracting orbit to prove that there exists a trapping region and an attractor .",
    "the transversality of admissible curves implies that the attractor does not coincide with the continuation of the periodic attracting orbits , but using a uniforme contraction property one proves that it still supports a unique hyperbolic srb measure .",
    "roughly , the complement of the basin of attraction is formed by points whose random iteration of quadratic maps that does not intersect the trapping region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s.statements ]",
    "we recall some definitions and state our main results . some preliminary results on one - dimensional dynamics and admissible curves are given along section  [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "finally , the proofs of the main results are given on sections  [ sec : positive.exp ] ,  [ sec : proofs ] and  [ sec : periodic ] .",
    "in this section we present the necessary definitions to state our main results .",

    "these are natural assumptions if one assumes the base dynamics to be induced map from some one - dimensional nonuniformly expanding map .",
    "condition ( ii ) implies the domains of invertibility of @xmath9 to be close to those of @xmath24 and that the dynamics in each domain is @xmath8-close to the original one .",

    "using theorem  [ thm : ksv ] , we deduce that there exists an open and dense set @xmath93 such that for any @xmath436 the corresponding unimodal map @xmath437 is hyperbolic . in consequence , @xmath437 admits a periodic attractor whose the basin of attraction s a full lebesgue measure set , it is open and dense .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 has a periodic saddle @xmath438 on the fiber over @xmath439 .",
    "now , notice that the pre - orbit @xmath440 : ( \\exists n\\ge 1 ) \\ ; g^{n}(\\theta)=p _ * \\}$ ] is dense in @xmath33 $ ] and so the set @xmath441 is dense in the attractor @xmath442 . since the fibered maps are non - singular with respect to lebesgue then there exists a dense subset of points in @xmath443 that are forward asymptotic to the saddle point @xmath438 and , consequently , have one negative lyapunov exponent as claimed in part ( 1 ) .",

    "the main purpose of this section is to prove theorem  [ thm : hiperbolicidade.fibrada ] for fibered maps obtained by perturbation of hyperbolic interval maps , which is of independent interest .",

    "since hyperbolicity is @xmath455-open and dense in the interval ( see  @xcite ) and @xmath30 is assumed small , by structural stability all interval maps @xmath456 are hyperbolic and topologically conjugated to @xmath448 : for every @xmath444 there exists an homeomorphism @xmath457 that is @xmath458-close to identity , varies continuously with @xmath459 and @xmath460 . in consequence",
