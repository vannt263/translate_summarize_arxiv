    "in the case of small antiferromagnetic correlation lengths @xmath48 , corresponding to the overdoped regime , the rpa should be a reasonable approximation for the spin susceptibility . the dashed line in fig .",

    "the superconducting order parameter is @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath3 equal to 0.135 and @xmath54 . the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 illustrates that most of the spectral weight resides in the bound state at the energy 0.038 and that only a small part of it has been left in the continuum at higher energies . away from @xmath55 the dashed curve in fig .",
    "1 does not change dramatically as long as the bound state lies still in the gapped region .",
    "entering the particle - hole continuum by going further away from @xmath55 destroys the bound state and most of the spectral weight shifts to high energies of the order of @xmath2 .",

    "for such a small @xmath48 practically all momenta in the sum over momenta in eq.([m  ] ) contribute substantially which means that @xmath43 is mainly determined by contributions away from the small region around @xmath55 so that the bound state and its low - energy scale is rather irrelevant for @xmath30 .",
    "this is confirmed by an explicit calculation of @xmath30 using rpa results for the various quantities in eq.([m  ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in the inset of fig . 1 for t=0 .",
    "@xmath43 ( solid line ) is structureless except at small energies where it vanishes rapidly due to the smallness of @xmath46 in this region and the cutoff @xmath62 for the integration over @xmath63 in eq.([d ] ) due to the bosonic factors .",
    "taking @xmath30 into account in eq.([phi1 ] ) yields the solid line in fig . 1 which differs only marginally from the dashed line",
    "this shows that at short correlation lengths the rpa result for @xmath64 is essentially correct and that the correction @xmath30 to @xmath36 is rather small .",
    "the underlying physical picture is that the momentary local axis of preferred spin directions fluctuates very rapidly due to the random forces induced by @xmath23 .",
    "the spectrum of these forces is given by @xmath65 and characterized by the large energy scale @xmath2 in agreement with the inset of fig .",
    "for large @xmath48 the spectral function @xmath66 is strongly peaked at @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the integration over @xmath68 in eq.([m  ] ) is restricted to momenta near @xmath69 or near @xmath1 .",
    "since we are interested in external momenta @xmath70 the momentum of one of the two spectral functions in eq.([d ] ) is small .",
    "due to spin conservation this spectral function describes spin diffusion and is mainly restricted to small values of @xmath63 . as a result one may neglect the small frequency transfer in the second spectral function in eq.([d ] ) . taking also the real part of @xmath30 into account we obtain from eqs.([m  ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , @xmath71 with @xmath72 and the equal - time correlation function @xmath73 in deriving eq.([m ] ) we used the fact that the two memory functions in eq.([phi1 ] ) depend for our parameters only slowly on momentum around the wave vector @xmath74 so that the combination @xmath75 on the right - hand side of eq.([m ] ) may be evaluated at @xmath1 .",
    "the sum over @xmath76 in eq.([omega ] ) runs over half of the brillouin zone centered around @xmath1 .",
    "the evaluation of the above expressions using the rpa encounters a problem : @xmath48 , calculated in the rpa , is in the optimal and moderately underdoped region around one or smaller and increases substantially only near the transition to the antiferromagnetic state in disagreement with the experiment .",
    "for instance , we have for @xmath77 @xmath78 , ref.@xcite @xmath79 using quite different parameter values , whereas the experimental values for @xmath48 are larger by about a factor 5 or more@xcite . since this large discrepancy would affect severely the momentum sum in eq.([omega ] )",
    "we prefer to use a realistic @xmath27 as input in calculating @xmath30 and write @xmath80 for @xmath81 considering @xmath48 as a parameter to be determined from experiment .",
    "it is instructive to study the frequency dependence of the denominator of eq.([phi1 ] ) . in order to describe a slightly underdoped case we choose the same parameters as in fig .",

    "this quantity is practically independent of momentum , increases monotonically with @xmath62 and is zero at the rpa resonance energy @xmath91 . the dashed and dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 show @xmath92 for the same momenta .",
    "these curves resemble the real part of an oscillator located at @xmath93 with an oscillator strength being very small at @xmath94 and strongly increasing with @xmath95 .",
    "the poles of eq.([phi1 ] ) are given by the common points of the two curves denoted by squares and circles . since the common point at @xmath96 ( not shown in fig .",
    "2 ) has vanishing pole strength there are two branches of collective spin excitations . for vanishing damping @xmath97 their dispersion is shown in fig . 3 by solid lines .",
    "they approximately touch each other at @xmath98 and disperse up- and downwards with increasing @xmath95 . for not too large @xmath95",
    "both branches lie below the continuum in agreement with experiment@xcite . performing the calculation in the normal state at @xmath99 the solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 lie everywhere above zero but the solid and dashed and also the dotted and dash - dotted lines have still one common point at larger frequencies . in this case only the upper but not the lower branch exists in agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "at very low dopings @xmath100 due to the constraint and the pole condition @xmath101 yields in the presence of long - range order the correct spin wave dispersion@xcite .",
    "several prerequisites are necessary to obtain the above hourglass dispersion for spin excitations .",
    "there must exist two different kinds of spin excitations to account for the two branches .",
    "the first one are rpa spin fluctuations where all induced spin moments have the same direction .",
    "they may be characterized by the fact that the internal fields induced by the heisenberg interaction conserves frequency , momentum and spin direction which is a direct consequence of the one - mode behavior of @xmath22 in eq.([l1 ] ) .",
    "the second one are local rotations of spins under the influence of @xmath23 in eq.([l2 ] ) . in this case",
    "a spin in z direction acquires in its time evolution also a component in x direction due to the presence of a spin fluctuation in y direction .",
    "the pure form of the two kind of spin excitations are obtained for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , and are realized approximately at large and small dopings . in the hourglass regime @xmath30 and @xmath36",
    "are of similar magnitude .",
    "another prerequisite for hourglass behavior is that @xmath48 is substantially larger than 1 .",
    "only then is the momentum integration in eq.([m  ] ) restricted to the resonance and the spin diffusion modes yielding oscillator - like behavior of @xmath30 near @xmath93 .",
    "the up- and downwards dispersion and their approximate degeneracy at @xmath1 is mainly determined by @xmath104 , which according to eq.([omega ] ) is roughly proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "the first factor tends to zero at low temperatures for @xmath106 and saturates at large @xmath107 . as a result @xmath104 is very small at @xmath98 causing the approximate touching of the two branches at @xmath108 and @xmath109 . with increasing @xmath107 @xmath104 increases strongly leading to a downward dispersion of the lower branch even if @xmath93 was practically dispersionless as in our case . according to fig .",
    "3 the upper branch increases at large @xmath95 roughly as @xmath110 , i.e. , with an effective spin wave velocity which is reduced by about a factor 2 - 3 compared to spin wave theory similar as in experiment@xcite .        using the same parameters as in figs . 2 and 3 fig . 4 shows @xmath64 as a function of @xmath4 with the frequency as a parameter . as suggested by fig .",
    "3 @xmath64 exhibits a hourglass dispersion with intensities which are largest near @xmath93 and decay rather fast and slow towards lower and higher frequencies , respectively . fig .",
    "5 shows @xmath64 as a function of @xmath62 for a fixed @xmath4 as a parameter . in agreement with fig .",
    "4 the strong peak at @xmath111 splits into two peaks with decreasing @xmath4 which disperse up- and downwards in frequency . the curve for @xmath111 calculated for the small damping @xmath112 has the shape of a lorentzian . at smaller dampings",
    "this peak splits into a double peak due to the small gap between upper and lower branch shown in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath102 only the lower , weaker peak is obtained .    in conclusion , we have shown that the memory function of the spin susceptibility contains in general two distinct contributions due to rpa - like and due to rotational spin fluctuations .",
    "the first one dominates at large , the second one at small dopings . at intermediate dopings both",
    "are of similar magnitude which leads to one upwards and one downwards dispersing branch of excitations . at low temperatures",
    "the two branches are approximately degenerate at @xmath1 which explains , at least qualitatively , the observed hourglass dispersion at intermediate dopings ."
