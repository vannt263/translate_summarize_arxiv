    "arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite have proposed a higher @xmath3-dimensional spacetime theory in which the standard model ( sm ) particles live in the usual 4-dimensional spacetime where as gravity also propagates in the additional compactified spatial dimensions .",
    "a remarkable feature of this scenario is the possibility that the planck mass can become comparable to the electro - weak scale , thus solving the hierarchy mystery that naturally exists in conventional theories where the planck mass is many orders of magnitude higher than the electro - weak scale .",
    "gravity in our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world then becomes feeble for distances much larger than the compactification scale @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 is the planck scale in our world and @xmath6 in the @xmath3-dimensional world , the two are related by @xcite @xmath7 setting @xmath8 tev , gives @xmath9ev - mev for @xmath10 .",
    "noting that the newtonian inverse square law of gravity has been verified up to about a millimetre , @xcite we see that no contradiction with newtonian gravity results in this approach .",
    "+ an alternative scenario has been proposed by randall and sundrum @xcite where once again there exists only one fundamental planck scale ( @xmath11 tev ) with the hierarchy of scales been generated by an exponential factor of the compactification radius in a 5-dimensional non factorizable geometry with the fifth dimension in the form of a torus . two 3-branes with opposite tensions",
    "are assumed to reside at @xmath12 orbifold fixed points @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angular coordinate parametrizing the extra dimension .",
    "of the two 3-branes , it is assumed that the sm - fields reside only at the one at @xmath15 whereas gravity is all over .",
    "calling as before @xmath5 the 4-dimensional planck scale , @xmath6 the planck scale in the 5-dimensional world , @xmath16 the compactification radius of the 5-dimensional torus , the two planck scales are related by the equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a parameter of the theory .",
    "choosing @xmath19 , one sees that @xmath6 can have values in the tev range , thus providing an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "+ the graviton propagating in the compact dimensions , in addition to our 4-dimensional world , appear in our world as a massless particle together with its radial excitations . in the add - scenario , these set of resonances are almost a continuum , each individually coupling with the 4-dimensional planck scale strength . however because of the large number of these resonances , their combined effect mimic a weak scale spin-2 excitation . in the rs model ,",
    "the graviton excitations are discrete with each coupling with masses calculable in terms of k and @xmath16 and each coupling with tev scale strength with matter .",
    "+ turning to phenomenological consequences of wsqg , it is clear that there will be in the nature of effective exchange effects of spin-2 particles with tev scale coupling .",
    "typically such contributions to the amplitudes will a have suppression factor of @xmath20 replacing the coupling parameters @xmath21 or @xmath22 in the corresponding sm amplitude .",
    "clearly the most important processes where these effects will show up in the sub - tev range are the ones where the sm - contribution is suppressed occurring only through higher order loop diagrams .",
    "processes involving @xmath23 collisions like @xmath1 offer the most exciting possibility of such processes .",
    "the sm contributions through loops of all charged particles are well calculated and at the same time the process seems to be experimentally accessible with @xmath24rays obtained from backward scattering of laser beams off high energy electrons . in the present investigation , we estimate the signatures of the wsqg theories in this process for energies in the tev - range .",
    "the process @xmath25 is described by 36 invariant amplitudes @xmath26 where the quantities @xmath27 , @xmath28 in parentheses in equation ( [ react ] ) denote the momentum and helicity of the corresponding particles and @xmath29 are the mandelstam variables .",
    "the @xmath30 s are related to the corresponding differential cross - section by the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the c.m .",
    "scattering angle and @xmath33 .",
    "parity and bose statistics imposes the following restrictions on the amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath35 the sm amplitudes corresponding to the w - loop and the fermion loops ( figure 1a ) have been evaluated @xcite . in the high energy limit that we are interested in , namely @xmath36 most of the amplitudes become negligible . for the w - loop contribution ,",

    "+ in the rs - version of wsqg , the interaction of the discrete set of resonances of mass @xmath60 can be represented by @xmath61 where @xmath62 tev.@xcite the mass of the resonances are given in terms of the zeroes @xmath63 of the bessel function @xmath64 by @xmath65 which can be written as @xmath66 phenomenologically , the rs version can be parametrized in terms of two parameters @xmath67 which is of order 1 and @xmath68 , the mass of the first rs - resonance.@xcite for a given value of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the summation implied in the evaluation of d(s ) can not be done analytically but numericallly the summation converges quite fast .",
    "for the range of parameters indicated therin , our results are shown in figures 2 - 9 . there is indeed considerable deviation from the sm results for the cross - section both in the add and the rs version of wsqg .",
    "the spin-2 nature of the massive gravitons is primarily responsible for the enhanced contribution of the gravitons in the tev - range .",
    "this is responsible for the @xmath70 factor in their contribution to the amplitudes and combined with a dimensional coupling this starts dominating in the tev range . in the add scenario , this is essentially because the net dimensionless parameter governing the amplitude is @xmath71 for n=2 ; this is @xmath72 in the tev - range for @xmath73 if @xmath51 is in the same range .",
    "+ for the rs scenario , the corresponding factor is @xmath74 which once again can be of @xmath72 even for small values of the parameter @xmath69 .",
    "the sm contribution is proportional to @xmath75 , so that as @xmath73 increases , one can expect the spin-2 contribution dominating after a while .",
    "this result of course can be taken seriously only upto a point .",
    "as @xmath76 or alternatively @xmath77 becomes larger than one , we can no longer neglect higher order corrections that renders the amplitude unitary . under such circumstances then , the results numerically are only indicative of considerable deviation from sm .",
    "+ in conclusion , experimental data on the process @xmath78 in the tev - range and its comparison with well caclulated sm - results can provide valuable signatures for possible wsqg contributions to the amplitude .",
    "it is important to note in this connection , that effects beyond the sm arising out of supersymmetric particle exchange contributions are much smaller than the wsqg effects and can not explain if large scale departures are obserbved in future experimental data .",
