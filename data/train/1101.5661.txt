    "nuclear reactions at intermediate energies as , e.g. , provided by the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi have been investigated for several decades but the physics governing their mechanisms are not yet thoroughly understood and further investigations seem necessary . recently the two experimental collaborations indra and fopi have published a series of systematic observations made in experiments at the gsi laboratory regarding several physical quantities such as the collective flows , the nuclear stopping , and the light cluster and produced - particle , i.e. mostly pion , production @xcite .",
    "comparisons with model calculations ( mainly performed with the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model ) , revealed some discrepancies which deserve deeper investigations , mainly concerning dynamical observables .",
    "the excitation functions of the directed and elliptic collective flows and the nuclear stopping can not be satisfactorily described with the same equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "important progress in nuclear physics at intermediate energies was made recently by reaching consensus on the soft nature of the eos of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however , according to the theory of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) , both the mean field and the two - body collisions have the same origin , the effective lagrangian density , based on which the medium modifications of both the collisions and the mean - field transport between the collisions should be considered self - consistently @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the medium - modified terms should take the density dependence , the isospin asymmetry , and the momentum constraints into account . in past investigations ,",
    "these medium effects were considered mainly in the mean - field part but usually not in the collision part , leading to an obvious lack of self - consistency .",
    "hence , conclusions based on these treatments are not fully reliable , and it is easy to understand why new difficulties arose in the recent comparisons of data with model calculations .    in the lower range of sis energies ,",
    "the collision rate is known to increase with beam energy and the interplay between mean field and two - body collisions leads to a colorful phenomenology of the nuclear dynamics as , e.g. , apparent in the excitation functions of collective flows  @xcite : with the increase of beam energy beyond the indra range ( @xmath2  mev / nucleon ) , the slope , near mid - rapidity and with respect to rapidity , of the directed flow of free protons or light clusters changes sign from negative to positive , while the value of the elliptic flow at mid - rapidity changes from positive ( in - plane ) to negative ( squeeze - out ) .",
    "these transitions of the directed and elliptic flows imply clearly that the strength of two - body collisions and the nuclear stopping power increase , which has been observed in recent indra experiments as well  @xcite . theoretically , in addition to the well - known density - dependent modifications of binary cross sections , the momentum constraints will have to be considered seriously in order to describe these data systematically  @xcite .    in our previous work ,",
    "we have attempted to build up a microscopic transport model in which the dynamic process of heavy ion collisions ( hics ) is described in a more consistent and complete manner .",
    "the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model is adopted as a microscopic transport basis  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , both the mean - field potentials and the relativistic effects on the relative distance and momentum in potentials are treated comprehensively . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the medium modifications of the nucleon - nucleon elastic cross sections ( nnecs ) are further taken into account . with the so improved version of the urqmd model , several experimental observables at sis and ags energies",
    "were successfully described  @xcite . with the further consideration of the `` pre - formed '' hadron potentials , the well - known hbt time - related puzzle throughout the beam energy range from sis up to rhic",
    "is well understood  @xcite .",
    "it is also found , however , that further investigation is still needed at the lower sis energies  @xcite .",
    "this will become evident in this work from the study of collective flows and nuclear stopping .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section ii presents the new updates in the urqmd transport model .",
    "results for collective flows and nuclear stopping in the energy range covered by indra and fopi experiments are then shown in section iii .",
    "finally , a conclusion and an outlook are given in section iv .",
    "the urqmd model is based on analogous principles as the qmd model @xcite and the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd ) model @xcite .",
    "the first formal version ( ver1.0 ) of the urqmd transport model was published at the end of last century @xcite . since then , a large number of successful theoretical analyses , predictions , and comparisons with data have been accomplished with this transport model for _ pp _ , _ p_a and aa reactions and over a large range of beam energies , essentially from sis over ags , sps , rhic , up to lhc energies  @xcite .      in the urqmd ,",
    "similar to the qmd , hadrons are represented by gaussian wave packets in phase space .",
    "after the initialization of projectile and target nuclei for which the hard - sphere ( h - s ) or the woods - saxon ( w - s ) mode may be selected , the phase space of hadron @xmath3 is propagated according to hamilton s equations of motion :    @xmath4    here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coordinate and momentum of hadron @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 consists of the kinetic energy @xmath8 and the effective two - body interaction potential energy @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    with @xmath11 in the standard version of the urqmd model @xcite , the potential energies include the two - body and three - body skyrme- , and the yukawa- , coulomb- , and pauli - terms as a base ,    @xmath12    the three - body terms of the skyrme force can be approximately written in the form of two - body interactions , the so - called density dependent terms . only the coulomb force between charged baryons is considered in the default version . however , when also considered for charged mesons it was found indispensable for reproducing certain observables  @xcite .",
    "the single particle potential follows from @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the phase - space wigner distribution function which reads as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the width parameter of the wave packet .",
    "it is known that the width affects the stability of initialized nuclei and the production of clusters at later reaction stages @xcite .",
    "empirically , the value of the wave packet width should grow from about 1 fm to 2 fm as the total mass of the colliding system increases from light to heavy . as an example , for au+au collisions a value of @xmath17 fm is chosen while for ca+ca and lighter nuclei @xmath18 fm is found more appropriate .    recently , in order to permit more successful applications in the intermediate energy regime ( @xmath19 gev ) , more potential terms have been incorporated into the urqmd  @xcite .",
    "the first addition is the density - dependent average symmetry potential energy term @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the isospin - asymmetry . in this work ,",
    "the form    @xmath22    introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is used . here",
    "@xmath23 is the symmetry energy at the normal nuclear density @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fermi kinetic energy at normal nuclear density , @xmath26 is the reduced nuclear density , and @xmath27 is the strength of the density dependence of the symmetry potential . in this work",
    ", the value @xmath28 mev is chosen .",
    "the symmetry potential is important for isospin - asymmetric reactions at intermediate and low energies since the uncertainties existing in the symmetry energy based on various theories were found to be large at densities away from the normal density @xcite . here , a soft ( @xmath29 ) density dependent symmetry potential is adopted .",
    "recent investigations indicate that the density dependence of the symmetry energy at subnormal densities might be soft @xcite",
    ". however , this will still have to be confirmed by further studies .",
    "the second addition is the momentum - dependent term @xcite @xmath30\\rho_i/\\rho_0 , \\label{umd}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 c@xmath33gev@xmath34 are selected as in previous calculations within the qmd family .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that this form may also have to be refined in order to obtain improved fits of the real part of the optical potential  @xcite .    at beam energies higher than the ags regime , potentials for `` pre - formed '' particles ( string fragments ) and relativistic effects regarding the relative distance and the relative momentum employed in the two - body potentials ( lorentz transformation )",
    "are , furthermore , considered @xcite .",
    "they can be neglected in this work here .      regarding the collision term , it is well - known that the rate of collisions is reduced by the quantum pauli - blocking .",
    "however , in the default version of the urqmd , for simplicity , the pauli - blocking criteria are realized with an algorithm based on fitted parameters : for the same type of particles , the binary scattering will be blocked under the form    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and    @xmath37    with @xmath38 the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ pbdefault1 ] ) are set to be 1.49641 and 0.208736 , respectively .",
    "it will be shown below that , for descriptions of experimental observables at the lower energies , the default pauli - blocking treatment is not precise enough .",
    "therefore , an updated new version of the pauli - blocking routine is introduced here .",
    "for the same type of particles and for each collision , firstly , the phase space densities in the final states are determined in order to assure that they are in agreement with the pauli principle and , secondly , the following two criteria are considered at the same time :    @xmath41    and @xmath42 on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ newbl1 ] ) , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the relative distance and momentum of the two particles at the final states @xmath3 and @xmath45 . the factor @xmath46 on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ newbl1 ] ) denotes the summation of the spins of the two particles . in eq .",
    "( [ newbl2 ] ) , @xmath47 represents a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "if one of the criteria is not fulfilled the collision is not allowed and the two particles remain with their original momenta .      it is also known that the cross sections will be modified by the nuclear medium , according to the qhd theory ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite . as in previous work ,",
    "the in - medium nnecs @xmath48 are treated to be factorized as the product of a medium correction factor @xmath49 and the free nnecs @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "for the inelastic channels , we still use the experimental free - space cross sections @xmath51 .",
    "it is believed that this assumption does not have strong influence on our present study at low sis energies .",
    "therefore , the total two - body scattering cross section of nucleons , @xmath52 , will be modified according to @xmath53 as for the medium correction factor @xmath49 , it is proportional to both the isospin - scalar density effect @xmath54 and the isospin - vector mass - splitting effect @xmath55 .",

    "the pauli - blocking treated in the default urqmd model is an effective one .",
    "the advantage of this treatment is the high - speed to calculate it .",
    "however , it is found that it is not quite suitable for nuclear reactions at low sis energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the reduced longitudinal rapidity distribution of directed ( @xmath82 , top plots ) and elliptic ( @xmath77 , bottom plots ) flows of free protons from semi - peripheral ( b=5.5 - 7.5 fm ) au+au collisions at @xmath83 , 80 , and 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "the calculations with the default treatment of pauli - blocking used in urqmd-0 and with the new treatment incorporated in urqmd - ii ( the only difference between the two versions , cf .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "considerable differences exist in the rapidity distribution of both flow parameters at the lower sis energies @xmath80 and 80 mev / nucleon . with the default treatment ,",
    "the slope of @xmath82 is significantly positive at mid - rapidity and the value of @xmath77 is rather small . experimentally it is known that the slope of the directed flow of @xmath1 particles from semi - central / peripheral collisions of heavy systems at 40 mev / nucleon is slightly negative at mid - rapidity and that the elliptic flow is positive with values near @xmath84  @xcite , values much closer to the results obtained with the new treatment of pauli - blocking ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left panels ) .",
    "it is , therefore , concluded that this modification of the urqmd is more suitable for this energy range , and the new treatment of pauli - blocking is chosen for the following investigations .",

[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "several interesting phenomena are observed : comparing first the results obtained with urqmd - ii and urqmd - iii which differ only in the initialization , small differences are seen but the directed flow is slightly less positive at 40 mev / nucleon and slightly more positive at 80 mev / nucleon with the hard - sphere treatment of urqmd - ii than with the wood - saxon initialization of urqmd - iii .",
    "this is due to the fact that at 40 ( 80 ) mev / nucleon the net - contribution of both mean - field potentials and two - body collisions is more attractive ( positive ) and the hard - sphere initialization may lead to stronger attraction ( repulsion ) .",
    "actually , this effect of different initializations was seen before in calculations with the iqmd model @xcite .",
    "since its effect on final flows is very small , mainly the hard - sphere initialization will be used in the following calculations .",
    "it is the default initialization in the urqmd model .",
    "secondly , if the mean - field potentials are ignored as in the cascade - type version urqmd - iv , a large positive slope of @xmath82 is seen at both beam energies .",
    "it implies that the net contribution of the collision term to the directed flow is repulsive .",
    "the elliptic flow has almost vanished which should be due to both , a relatively weak contribution of the collision term and the almost isotropic differential nnecs .",
    "on the other hand , if the collision term is switched off and only the mean - field potentials are active as in urqmd - vi , a strong negative directed flow is seen at both beam energies . the elliptic flow @xmath77 is largest in this case , indicating that the mean - field potentials contribute to the collective flows much more strongly than the collision term at lower sis energies , a fact that is well - known .",
    "it is also found that the net contributions of the mean - field and of two - body collisions to the directed flow are attractive and repulsive , respectively .",
    "the positive elliptic flow induced by the mean - field is caused by the in - plane geometry at early reaction times .",
    "the isospin - scalar and isospin - vector related parts of the potentials may yield different contributions to the final flows .",
    "this was tested with the results of urqmd - ii , urqmd - iv , and urqmd - v in which a soft - eos with momentum dependence ( sm - eos , the corresponding incompressibility @xmath86 mev ) is considered , not considered , and partially considered , respectively , while the same collision term is adopted .",
    "it is found that the iso - scalar part of the potentials produces a strong attractive force ( comparison of urqmd - iv and urqmd - v ) while the iso - vector related part gives a relatively weak repulsive force to the directed flow ( see from urqmd - v to urqmd - ii ) .",
    "the repulsion caused by the iso - vector potentials ( symmetry and coulomb potentials ) is obvious since the coulomb potential of protons is always repulsive and much stronger than the symmetry potential , regardless of whether the total effect of the symmetry term is attractive or repulsive .",
    "the latter depends on the isospin - asymmetry of the nuclear medium during the whole dynamic process of hics .    summarizing this analysis",
    ", one finds clearly that 1 ) the balance of contributions between mean - field potentials and the collision term determines the vanishing of the directed flow at low sis energies with roughly equal strength ; 2 ) in the mean - field potentials , the iso - scalar part behaves as an attractive effect which is due to the overall rather low densities of heavy - ion collisions at such low beam energies . the iso - vector part is repulsive which is mainly due to the mutual coulomb repulsion of the protons .     of directed flow ( top panels ) and @xmath77 of elliptic flow ( bottom panels ) for free protons from semi - peripheral ( @xmath85  fm ) @xmath79au+@xmath79au collisions at @xmath80 ( left ) and 400  mev / nucleon ( right ) as functions of the reduced rapidity @xmath81 .",

    "two beam energies 40 and 400  mev / nucleon are selected .",
    "the comparison of urqmd - i , urqmd - ii , urqmd - viii shows the effects on the flow parameters resulting from different momentum - modified nnecs while the comparison of urqmd - ii and urqmd - ix shows those of the momentum - dependent terms in the potentials ( with or without momentum dependence ) .",
    "it is , first of all , noticed that both effects , the momentum modification of the density - dependent nnecs in the collision term and the momentum dependence of the potentials affect both flow variables @xmath82 and @xmath77 . secondly , when studied in more detail , these flow effects are found to behave differently at different beam energies : ( 1 ) regarding the contribution of medium - modified cross sections , we see that for the directed flow at 40  mev / nucleon the difference is large between the urqmd - i and urqmd - ii results , while at 400  mev / nucleon the largest difference exists between the urqmd - i and urqmd - viii results .",
    "it is obviously caused by the difference of the momentum modifications of cross sections ( fp1 , fp2 , and no @xmath87 limit ) as they appear at different energies ; ( 2 ) for the elliptic flow at 40  mev / nucleon , a difference is seen between the urqmd - viii and urqmd - ix results , while this is no longer the case at 400  mev .",
    "it implies that , at 40  mev / nucleon , the momentum - dependent term in the potentials is more important than the momentum modification of the density dependent nnecs .",
    "they become equally important at 400  mev / nucleon .",
    "a rough comparison of the calculations with indra and fopi data for @xmath1 particles from the same system shows that the effect of the momentum - dependent terms in the potentials is repulsive , i.e. not suitable for describing the measured negative slope of the @xmath82 flow and the largely positive @xmath77 ( in - plane flow ) at mid - rapidity and at the beam energy 40  mev / nucleon . at 400  mev / nucleon ,",
    "the consideration of the momentum dependence in both , the mean - field and collision terms , is important to describe the measured largely positive slope of @xmath82 and largely negative @xmath77 ( squeeze - out ) at mid - rapidity .",

    "calculations with the default pauli - blocking treatment in urqmd-0 ( top - left ) are compared to those with the new pauli - blocking treatment combined with the same ( urqmd - ii , top - right ) or alternative momentum modifications of nnecs ( urqmd - i , bottom - left and urqmd - viii , bottom - right ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath56 , for the full range of rapidities , are also given for each of the urqmd versions .",
    "we first notice that , in the urqmd-0 mode , the relative maximum of the proton yield is higher at mid - longitudinal - rapidity than at mid - transverse - rapidity , which leads to @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , calculations with the new treatment of the pauli - blocking , despite of uncertainties in the cross sections , the values of @xmath56 are always smaller than unity , in line with the experimental data .",
    "secondly , with decreasing cross sections ( the reduction of nnecs due to the momentum modifications increases successively going from urqmd - i to urqmd - ii and urqmd - viii ) , the calculated values of @xmath56 become smaller and approach the experimental value @xmath92 @xcite measured with indra at @xmath90  mev / nucleon ( note , however , that one can not compare directly with data since the experimentally selected clusters ( @xmath93 ) and rapidity bins are different from the current calculations performed for @xmath1 particles ) . together with the flow results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , these comparisons clearly show that the momentum modification of nnecs are important for describing the collective flows and the nuclear stopping at the low sis energies at the same time .",
    "thirdly , in the analyses related to figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig5 ] , one finds that the results for flows and for the nuclear stopping always follow in the same order when different treatments of the mean - field and the collisions terms are chosen .",

    "if we switch off both the momentum - dependent term in the potentials and the momentum modification of nnecs in the collision term , realized with the urqmd - x calculation , the value of the @xmath82 slope is pushed down further and approaches the indra data . as a result of these tests , one may reach a deeper understanding of the difficulties in theoretically describing experimental data and of the importance of treating self - consistently the dynamic process of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that even the version urqmd - x is still not good enough to permit the description of the directed flow over the whole range of indra energies .",

    "the versions chosen for the comparison are urqmd - x , closest to the indra data at 150  mev / nucleon ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) , and urqmd - xiii .",
    "the latter differs from urqmd - xii , closest to the data at 40  mev / nucleon , in that the sm - eos and the fp1 momentum modification of nnecs ( the standard in previous investigations  @xcite ) are adopted and from urqmd - x by the stronger density dependence fu3 for nnecs ( same as in urqmd - xii ) . at about @xmath98  @xmath99 ,",
    "the pre - equilibrated protons are emitted with a small positive flow due to the initial geometry . with increasing time , up to about 60  @xmath99 , the value of the @xmath82 slope increases or decreases , depending on the balance between strong attractive and repulsive effects on particles during the rescattering process . at 40  mev / nucleon , the net contribution is attractive , whereas at 150  mev / nucleon it is repulsive , leading to the corresponding negative and positive flows .",
    "after 60  @xmath99 , the final - state interactions ( fsi ) still affect the collisions at the low beam energy 40  mev / nucleon , and the contributions of two - body scatterings start to become stronger than those of the mean field potentials .",
    "it is found that , although the fsi affects the final flow results , the urqmd - x can not describe well the data at 40  mev / nucleon .",
    "the urqmd - xiii calculations can describe reasonably well both results at 40 and 150  mev / nucleon .    ) for @xmath1 particles from semi - central ( @xmath94  fm ) @xmath79au+@xmath79au collisions in the range of indra energies from 40 to 150  mev / nucleon .",
    "calculations with urqmd - x ( dashed ) and urqmd - xiii ( full line ) are compared with the indra data ( stars ) .",
    "the dotted horizontal line representing the zero slope is included for comparison.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the excitation function of the slope of directed flow at mid - rapidity for @xmath1 particles from semi - central au+au collisions is shown for the range of indra energies from 40 to 150  mev / nucleon .",
    "the data are from ref .",
    "@xcite and compared to the results obtained with the same urqmd - x and urqmd - xiii whose time evolution has just been discussed .",
    "it is seen clearly that the urqmd - xiii calculations describe the data well over the whole energy range including the location of the transition energy which is closely reproduced .",
    "it has to be noticed , however , that , in the energy range 90 - 150  mev / nucleon covered also by fopi experiments , the fopi result for the @xmath82  slope of @xmath1 particles is higher by up to 0.05 than the indra data  @xcite",
    ". thus , in order to pin down the exact form of the medium modifications on both the mean - field potentials and the collision terms , it will also be necessary to further reduce remaining uncertainties on the experimental side",
    "in summary , by using the microscopic transport model urqmd , we have performed a systematic investigation on the effects of the momentum dependence of the mean field and the corrections from various aspects in the collision term , especially the modification of the density and momentum dependence of nucleon - nucleon elastic cross sections ( nnecs ) on the observables , such as the directed and elliptic flow and the stopping in hics at low sis energies .",
    "it is clearly seen that the collective flows and the nuclear stopping are sensitive to all these effects , meaning that they are important to the non - equilibrium dynamic process in hics at low sis energies .",
    "further , in order to describe experimental observables systematically , a consistent consideration of the uncertainties associated with both , the mean - field and the two - body collisions , is extremely important and should be paid more attention .",
    "the momentum dependence of the mean field potentials and of the density - dependent nnecs is found to be sensitive to the collectivity exhibited by the collision dynamics of hics . at indra energies",
    "( 40 - 150  mev / nucleon ) , the dynamic transport with a soft equation - of - state with momentum dependence ( sm - eos ) and with momentum - dependent and density - modified nnecs ( @xmath100 ) describes the slope of the directed flow of @xmath1 particles at mid - rapidity rather well .    from ref .",
    "@xcite we learned that the cluster charge - z dependence of the transition energy of flows has been discovered .",
    "however , the verification by the theoretical side is still absent since in many previous theoretical investigations the vanishing flow was studied with a cluster charge - z _ independent _ global quantity  the so - called directed transverse momentum @xmath101 . in addition , the isospin effect should be visible in ( the time evolution and the excitation function of ) collective flows at low sis energies .",
    "the knowledge of the effect of isospin asymmetry on both the mean field and the nnecs might be renewed under the new version of the urqmd .",
    "these studies are currently underway and will be addressed in a forthcoming paper .",
