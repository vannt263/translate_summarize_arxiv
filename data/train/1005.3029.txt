    "the first confirmed soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) burst was detected in 1979 but it took @xmath4 years ( @xcite ) to associate it with a newly discovered population of astronomical objects , namely neutron stars repeatedly emitting soft and short gamma - ray bursts with peculiar properties . a decade later , these objects , together with their cousins , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; see e.g. , @xcite ) , were shown to possess extremely high magnetic fields ( @xmath5 g ) , as deduced from their spin periods and spindown rates , and were named magnetars @xcite .",
    "the most distinguishing magnetar characteristics are a narrow range of spin periods ( 2@xmath012s ) , high spindown rates ( @xmath6 s / s ) and unpredictable burst - active episodes .",
    "the latter can have a multitude of bursts with a wide luminosity range , anywhere from 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 times the eddington luminosity .",
    "it is these bursts that enable the initial classification of a source as an sgr , to be subsequently confirmed as a magnetar with timing analysis ( see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed review on magnetars . )    by 2008 a dozen sources were confirmed magnetars and a couple more were listed as magnetar candidates pending observations of new burst active episodes . for the known sources , frequent spin period monitoring observations with the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) over the last fifteen years have provided a wealth of insight about their dynamics and energetics . interestingly , despite their common characteristics , there are several important differences across this small population , and a larger sample of objects at different evolutionary stages is necessary to better understand the phenomenon .",
    "magnetar hunting however , is not an easy task ; we have two strikes against us _ ab initio _ : their very small numbers and their very short active periods ( days to months ) .",
    "thus , the best way to discover magnetars is the combination of an all - sky x - and gamma - ray monitor  to detect their bursts  and a timing instrument  to measure their spin and spindown rates , and estimate their magnetic fields .    on 2010",
    "march 19 , the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard nasa s _ swift _ satellite triggered at 18:34:50 ut on one short and soft burst ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2010 ) originating from a region in the plane of our milky way galaxy that harbors at least three other magnetar candidates : axp xte j1810 - 197 , and sgrs 1806 - 20 and 1801 - 23 . using the initial source localization with the bat , which had a 3@xmath9 error radius , we were able to excluded all these sources ; further , based on the spectral and temporal properties of the event , we identified the source of the emission as a possible new sgr .",
    "subsequent observations ( starting from 60  s after the bat trigger ) of the source region with the _ swift_/x - ray telescope ( xrt ) provided the source position with a 1.6@xmath10 uncertainty @xcite . _ swift_/ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ) observations starting 71 s after the trigger did not detect a source in the uv or optical bandpass at the xrt position @xcite . to confirm the nature of the source , we observed it with _ rxte _ for 1.3 ks _ less than 3.25 hours _ after its discovery was reported . a subsequent timing analysis of this observation revealed coherent pulsations in the x - ray flux of the source with a period of 7.56 s @xcite .",
    "thus , we were able to identify sgr  j1833@xmath00832  as a slowly rotating neutron star in less than 6 hours after its discovery , the second time such a fast discovery was enabled only due to the unprecedented synergy of _ swift _ and _ rxte _ ( the first was the identification of sgr j0501 + 4516 ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ swift _ was the only satellite that triggered on sgr  j1833@xmath00832  ; although the source was in the field of view of the gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fgst _ ) , the fluence of the event was much lower than any of the gbm trigger thresholds . to precisely locate the source we triggered our target of opportunity ( too ) observations with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( _ cxo _ ) and obtained observations with the european southern observatory ( _ eso _ ) very large telescope / high accuity wide - field k - band imager ( _ vlt / hawki _ ) and with the gran telescopio canarias / optical imager and spectrograph ( _ gtc / osiris _ ) .",
    "we also observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope pulsar machine ii ( _ wsrt / puma ii _ ) and searched for radio pulsations from the source .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the discovery of sgr  j1833@xmath00832 , and introduce its characteristics through our detailed multi - wavelenth investigations . in  2 , we describe all multi - wavelength data used in our study .",
    "we present in  3 the precise localization of the new source using _ cxo _ , 2mass and ukirt data , and the temporal and spectral characteristics of the persistent x - ray emission from the source using our _ swift _ and _ rxte _ observations .",
    "finally , we discuss and interpret our results in  4 .",

    "future observations to search for variability of these sources may provide a stronger diagnostic .",
    "we used an epoch folding algorithm to determine the pulse ephemeris of sgr  j1833@xmath00832 , as follows .",
    "we first determined the source pulse frequency using closely spaced _",
    "rxte_/pca observations on 2010 march 21 with a total exposure of 44 ks and generated a template pulse profile in the 2@xmath010 kev band .",
    "we then grouped all available pca observations into 22 discrete time segments , each separated by at least 0.3 days .",
    "for each segment , we generated the pulse profile and cross - correlated it with the template to obtain the phase drift with respect to the template .",
    "we finally fit the phase shifts with a first or higher order polynomial to determine the pulse ephemeris of the source .",
    "the method summarized here is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we first attempted to model the phase drifts with respect to the template using a first order polynomial .",
    "this resulted in a poor fit ( @xmath63@xmath64/d.o.f .",
    "= 122.1/21 ) with significant deviations of phase drift values from the model .",
    "modelling the phase drifts with a second order polynomial results in a good fit ( @xmath63@xmath64/d.o.f .",
    "= 19.9/20 ) with a spin period of 7.5654091(8 ) s and a period derivative of ( 4.39@xmath170.43)@xmath110@xmath2 s / s ( epoch mjd 55276.5 ) .",
    "we present in figure [ fig : phase_fit ] the pulse phase drifts with respect to the phase of the template profile with a second order polynomial fit ( top panel ) , and the residuals of the fit ( lower panel ) .",
    "we investigated the energy dependence of the rms pulsed fraction of sgr  j1833@xmath00832  by folding all available xrt data in pc mode in the 0.2@xmath04 kev , 4@xmath06 kev and 6@xmath010 kev bands using the pulse ephemeris presented in  3.2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : pc_pps ] , we present the pulse profiles of sgr  j1833@xmath00832  in the three specified energy intervals ( left ) and the normalized profiles obtained by dividing with the maximum value of each pulse profile ( right ) .",
    "we note that although the intensity of pulsations varies significantly in energy , the normalized amplitude of the pulsed signal remains remarkably constant .",
    "consequently , we find that the rms pulsed fraction of sgr  j1833@xmath00832  does not vary as a function of energy with rms pulse fractions of ( 34@xmath172)% , ( 36@xmath172)% and ( 39@xmath175)% in the above energy intervals , respectively .",
    "therefore , combining all available data in the 0.2@xmath010 kev range yields an rms pulsed fraction of ( 36@xmath172)% , which also remained constant over the entire course of the @xmath3730 days of xrt observations .",
    "we also investigated the rms pulsed intensity variations of sgr  j1833@xmath00832  in time and energy using all available pca data in the 2@xmath04.5 kev , 4.5@xmath08.5 kev and 8.5@xmath014 kev intervals .",
    "these energy bounds are selected to accommodate enough counts in each interval and determine the rms pulsed intensities with at least 5@xmath47 significance .",
    "we find that the pulsed count rates of the source remain fairly constant in all three energy intervals at around 0.017 , 0.025 and 0.006 counts / s / pcu , respectively .",
    "we performed spectral analysis using only the xrt / pc observations , to avoid the high background effects of the wt observation .",
    "the data were rebinned to 20 counts per spectral bin to improve the fitting statistics .",
    "we fit the persistent source data with single component models and found that the first 12 pc mode observations ( i.e. , observations 000 through 013 excluding 002 in table [ sgr : tab : xrtobs ] ) are fully consistent with a constant source .",
    "consequently , we summed all 12 observations into one single spectrum , which contained @xmath65 counts collected over 150 ks .",
    "we then rebinned the spectrum to 30 counts per bin and limited our spectral analysis to the @xmath42 kev energy range , to account for the high absorption towards the source direction , and fit several absorbed ( using phabs ) single component models within xspec .",
    "the best fit spectral model parameters are listed in table [ sgr : tab : spectrum ] .",
    "given the very high column density , the overall spectrum can be equally well fit by a steep power law ( @xmath66 ) or by a blackbody model with @xmath67 kev ; no additional components are required .",
    "we note that the derived neutral hydrogen column densities ( see table [ sgr : tab : spectrum ] ) are larger than the estimated galactic column density of @xmath68 cm@xmath7 in the direction of sgr  j1833@xmath00832 . when we fixed the column density to this galactic value , no single or double component model was able to account for the observed spectrum , indicating that the high column density could be intrinsic to the source or to its surroundings .",
    "it is important to also note that the origin of the high column density might be high density of molecular hydrogen in the galactic plane , on which the source is located .",

    "it is , therefore , unlikely that the ( detected ) burst emission provided the energy budget for the persistent x - ray emission .",
    "the spectrum of the _ swift_/bat burst is well described by a power law with exponential cutoff ( e@xmath86 = 38 kev ) or a black body with kt=10 kev .",
    "its spectral and temporal characteristics are very similar to those of known magnetars , in particular , to those of sgr  j0418@xmath875729 , which emitted only two rather dim bursts in one day @xcite , and 1e 2259@xmath87586 , which displayed a short episode of bursting for about 10 ks in 2002 seen only in hard x - rays @xcite .",
    "in addition to the _ swift_/bat event , we identified 4 weak x - ray bursts in our monitoring observations with the _ rxte_/pca , which were not detected in the simultaneous _ fermi_/gbm data .",

    "using these values , we estimate the dipole magnetic field strength of sgr  j1833@xmath00832  to be b = 1.8 @xmath110@xmath3 g , which is at the lower end of the b - fields of sgrs and close to the median value of those of axps ( b@xmath90 = 2.2@xmath110@xmath3 g ) .",

    "figure [ fig : xrtflux ] exhibits the evolution of the persistent x - ray emission unabsorbed fluxes ( @xmath93 kev ) for five magnetars ( data obtained from @xcite ) and sgr  j1833@xmath00832 , observed with _ swift_/xrt in the @xmath42 kev range .",
    "each source was observed immediately after an outburst , when the persistent emission level had significantly increased from its quiescent state .",
    "we notice that all sources had similar maxima at the onset of their activation , ranging between @xmath94 and @xmath95 erg/@xmath30/s .",
    "three of the sources ( sgrs  j@xmath96 , j@xmath92 and j@xmath97 ) declined in a similar monotonic manner .",

    "the other two sources ( 1e  @xmath99 and cxou  j@xmath100 ) show similar trends ( but different from the other three sources ) : they remain flat after activation for @xmath101 days and decline _ thereafter _ with the same trend as the former three .",
    "we have plotted the sgr  j1833@xmath00832  data as a band with an upper and lower bound on figure [ fig : xrtflux ] ; the upper flux limit is derived when we fit a single power law and the lower with a blackbody fit . because of the excessive column density towards the source , there are very few photons below 2 kev and the spectral fits are not well constrained ; the real unabsorbed flux of the source is within these two bounds , and seems to remain constant over the first @xmath3720 days following the onset .",
    "interestingly , we found an archival _ chandra_/acis - s observation covering the field of sgr  j1833@xmath00832  starting on 2009 february 13 10:50:20 ut for a total of 8 ks .",
    "the source was not detected within our _ chandra _  error circle (  [ sec : chandraobs ] ) and we were able to derive a @xmath102 upper limit ( indicated by a dotted line on figure [ fig : xrtflux ] ) for its quiescent unabsorbed flux of @xmath103 erg/@xmath30/s @xcite .",
    "this is almost 100 times fainter than the current state of the source ; assuming that sgr  j1833@xmath00832  reaches this level again , it would take at least 2 years if it follows the same decline trend of the other five sources as indicated by the last xrt observations .",

    "finally , pulsed radio emission has been detected from two magnetars , xtej1810 - 197 @xcite and 1e1547.0 - 5408 ( sgrj1550 - 5418 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former showed radio pulsations after an x - ray outburst from the source , but the latter was seen in radio while the source was quiescent in x - rays .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our search for radio emission from sgr  j1833@xmath00832  with the _ wsrt _ resulted in non - detections , with upper limits of @xmath105 and @xmath106,mjy ( depending on the assumed pulse widths ) at 2280 and 1380mhz , respectively .",
    "@xcite reported an upper limit of 0.09 mjy at 1400 mhz on 2010 march 25 with the parkes radio telescope .",
    "these upper limits are somewhat higher than some of the deepest radio searches for other magnetars , but more than an order of magnitude lower than the detections of xtej@xmath107 and 1e@xmath108 .      a visual inspection of the region surrounding sgr  j1833@xmath00832  on the @xmath109band images of the _ ukirt  _ gps reveals no obvious source clustering in the vicinity of the source .",
    "however , as the field is small and crowded , low mass open clusters may be difficult to discern from bright background sources .",
    "we have performed a color - color search to uncover any cluster members ; we caution , however , that it is still likely that the number of `` unrelated '' sources may obscure the detection of any faint , low surface brightness cluster that may be present .",
    "there are several sources in the larger field which are plausible sites for the birth of sgr  j1833@xmath00832 .",
    "one of these is the hii region iras  @xmath110 , at @xmath111 , @xmath112 , which is offset by roughly @xmath113 from sgr  j1833@xmath00832 , another is [ lph96 ] 023.162 + 0.023 ( @xmath114 ; 10 arcmin offset , @xcite ) , while a third is [ kc97c ] g023.5 + 00.0 at @xmath115 , which is also associated with a cluster known as bds2003 118 @xcite .",
    "further , there are several dark clouds in the vicinity of sgr  j1833@xmath00832 , which apparently do not yet host stellar populations .",
    "they have masses of @xmath116 m@xmath117 , and are likely locations for a next generation of star formation within the region .",
    "finally , there is also a known pulsar ( psr j1830 - 08 ) roughly 37 away from sgr j1833 - 0832 with an adopted distance of 5.67 kpc and a characteristic age of 147 kyr .",
    "it is possible that this source originates from the same star forming region associated with sgr  j1833@xmath00832 .",
    "while the dynamics of sgrs are as yet effectively unconstrained by observations ( no sgrs have yet proper motion or radial velocity measurements ) we can consider constraints by assuming that they i ) have a short lifetime @xmath118 years , and ii ) have a kick velocity distribution broadly comparable to that seen for young pulsars . in practice",
    "this second assumption only improves the constraints we can make if the actual kicks are _ significantly _ smaller , and hence limit the transverse distance that sgr  j1833@xmath00832  could have travelled since birth .",
    "a typical pulsar kick might be of order 200 km s@xmath75 , so that in @xmath119 years the source may move @xmath120 pc on the sky .",
    "hence the angular scale sgr  j1833@xmath00832  could cover would be @xmath121 . for a distance of 6 - 12 kpc this corresponds to an angular scale of @xmath122 , although allowing for a range of kick velocities might extend this range by a factor of 3 or more .",
    "in this case it would seem that none of the candidate clusters above are likely birthplaces .",
    "however , it is also possible ( although not necessarily likely ) that any progenitor may have `` evaporated '' from the cluster in which it formed with a velocity dispersion of a few km s@xmath75 . with a lifetime of a few myr",
    ", this may result in a progenitor at a large distance from the cluster , making our constraints weaker .",
