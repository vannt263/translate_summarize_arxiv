    "the study of a metric space can often be facilitated by considering it in the large scale , or by studying asymptotic phenomena .",
    "for instance , adding a boundary to compactify ( or , more generally ,  bordify \" ) a metric space is a key tool in understanding the space and its isometry group .",
    "a classical example is the hyperbolic space @xmath0 , with its boundary sphere at infinity .",
    "isometries of @xmath0 extend to homeomorphisms of the boundary , and can be classified by their fixed points on the boundary .",
    "more generally , any gromov hyperbolic space ( that is , a space with large - scale negative curvature ) has such a naturally defined boundary at infinity .    in trying to understand the geometry of groups , it is often useful to regard the group as a metric space by choosing a generating set , forming the associated _ cayley graph _ , which will be defined below .",
    "the metric induced by declaring all edges in the cayley graph to have length one is called the _ word metric _ on the group .",
    "it would seem quite natural to define a boundary for groups directly from the word metric , and this works well if the group is gromov hyperbolic .",
    "in general , however , there are obstructions to the usefulness of this boundary , as we will see below .",
    "this note explores properties of the visual boundary for groups , introducing the needed definitions along the way .",
    "the main result is that the visual boundary of @xmath1 ( denoted @xmath2 ) with the standard generating set possesses the trivial topology on an uncountable set . indeed",
    ", there are many groups which have so called  quasi - flats , \" or quasi - isometric embeddings of @xmath1 .",

    "[ example : qtheta ] denote the real ray in @xmath48 from the origin that makes an angle of @xmath103 with the positive @xmath104-axis as @xmath105 .",

    "so @xmath121 .",
    "to get the second inequality , the argument is reversed : @xmath122 so letting @xmath123 yields the quasi - isometry inequality .    the argument is completed by noting that for any @xmath39 , @xmath124    with this , we can speak unambiguously about the large - scale geometry of groups  those properties of groups that are invariant under quasi - isometry .",
    "let @xmath3 be a geodesic space .",
    "then for @xmath125 we define @xmath126 we will suppress @xmath3 from the notation and simply write @xmath127 .",
    "we want to think of light traveling along geodesics in the space @xmath3 .",
    "so we think of the visual boundary as the set of all points one can  see \" at infinity , standing at the point @xmath10 .",
    "we give @xmath127 the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets .",

    "we conclude that @xmath171 is open , and ultimately that @xmath155 is a homeomorphism between @xmath158 and @xmath146 .",
    "we would like a way to talk about the visual boundary of a metric space , without reference to a specified basepoint .",
    "unfortunately , there are many cases when the visual boundary changes if we use a different basepoint .",

    "only that @xmath243 was open and non - empty , we showed that @xmath243 contains all elements of @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 has the trivial topology .",
    "informally speaking , if we  zoom out \" from @xmath1 by rescaling distances to be smaller and smaller , we limit to @xmath48 with the @xmath55-norm .",
    "( formally , this construction is called the _ asymptotic cone _ , and @xmath276 ) . )",
    "we expect the same method of proof from above to show that the visual boundary of @xmath277 is an uncountable set with the trivial topology . and",
    "in fact , this is true .",
    "geodesic rays are no longer restricted to vertical and horizontal segments , but they have a similar property .",
    "let us first discuss geodesic rays that enter the interior of the first quadrant .",
    "let @xmath280 be a geodesic ray from the origin , passing through the point @xmath281 , with @xmath282 .",
    "then for all @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 .",
    "in other words , once a geodesic begins to move in a north - westerly direction , it can never again move toward the south or east ( see figure [ figure : ell1 ] ) .",
    "a similar property , of course , also holds in the other quadrants .",
    "there are more geodesic rays in this space than in @xmath1 .",
    "but after we take the quotient , we get the same boundary",
    ". we will appeal to the axiom of choice .",
    "certainly , @xmath286 is at least @xmath279 , since each geodesic ray in @xmath1 includes as a geodesic ray into @xmath277 .",
    "now , for each equivalence class of asymptotic rays @xmath141 \\in { \\partial_\\infty}(({\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^2 , \\ell^1))$ ] , choose a representative geodesic ray , @xmath69 .",
    "then , as before , consider the image of this ray under the quasi - isometry from @xmath48 onto @xmath1 , and connect vertices by horizontal and vertical segments to get @xmath287 , a geodesic ray in @xmath1 .",
    "identifying @xmath288 and @xmath289 with their images in @xmath48 by inclusion , we see that @xmath290 and @xmath291 , so the map from @xmath278 to @xmath2 is an injection .",
    "this establishes that @xmath292 .",
    "let @xmath293 be any arbitrary geodesic rays in the closure of quadrant @xmath224 .",
    "we will show that given any compact @xmath248 and @xmath24 , @xmath43 has a representative @xmath294 $ ] such that @xmath295 .",
    "just as before , this argument establishes that any open set containing a single ray in quadrant @xmath224 contains all rays in quadrant @xmath224 , and can be extended to show that any non - empty open set contains every ray .    what s wrong with this state of affairs ?",
    "this boundary completely fails to be hausdorff : we ca nt separate any two directions at infinity .",
    "convergence to a particular point in the boundary is meaningless .    to see some of the consequences of this finding , consider that a large class of groups have an undistorted free abelian subgroup ; that is , a quasi - isometric embedding of @xmath298 , called a _ quasi - flat_. these arise whenever two elements commute and there is no  shortcut \" to words in those elements coming from a relator .",
    "besides the obvious extension of the same argument to @xmath299 , quasi - flats can also be found in right - angled artin groups , as well as mapping class groups of surfaces .",
    "papasoglu shows in @xcite that every semi - hyperbolic group which is not hyperbolic contains such a quasi - flat .",
    "this includes fundamental groups of compact manifolds of non - positive curvature .",
