    "one of the salient features of the stochastic evolutionary game dynamics for finite populations is the _ fixation _ @xcite .",
    "that is , no matter how the initial strategies are distributed in a population , the system will eventually be fixated to only one strategy . in general , this phenomenon can be theoretically explained in terms of a markov process with absorbing state(s ) @xcite : the limiting theory of markov processes tells us that the finite - state markov chains with absorbing states will eventually be trapped into one of the absorbing states as time passes .",
    "the well - known wright - fisher model @xcite , moran process @xcite and the pairwise comparison processes @xcite all belong to this class .",
    "a further classification of darwinian selection scenarios based on the fixation descriptions has already been established in stochastic game dynamics @xcite .",
    "another important class consists of evolutionary dynamics with _ mutations _ where an ergodic mutation - selection equilibrium can be reached @xcite .",
    "the latter is out of the scope of our study ; however , the _ landscape _ introduced in the present work provides a unified perspective for both classes of processes .",
    "in addition to the ultimate fixation , attention should also be paid to the time - dependent , pre - fixation transient behavior for several reasons @xcite : on one hand , the process to fixation is intimately dependent upon both the transient movements before absorption and the one last step to fixation .",
    "that is , studying the transient dynamics provides important insights into the final fixation behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "sometimes the time for a true fixation is too long to be observed @xcite and the relevant time scale can be shorter @xcite . in this case , the transient dynamics provides a more appropriate description . furthermore , examinations of transients can yield a mechanistic understanding of the _ persistence _ and _ coexistence _ in complex biological dynamics , especially in ecosystems @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been found that the pre - fixation transient dynamics could be an essential explanatory aspect of characterizing the stochastic fluctuations raised from finite populations @xcite .",
    "the theory of quasi - stationarity is a widely applied , standard technique of studying the pre - fixation process @xcite .",
    "it defines the subchain with the absorbing states removed .",
    "based on this approach , we present an extended analysis for the transient dynamics of the well - mixed frequency - dependent moran process .",
    "an ergodic _ conditional _ stationary distribution is used to characterize the pre - fixation process . as a result of the law of large numbers , this stationary distribution approaches to a singular distribution in the infinite population limit .",
    "the corresponding large deviation rate function @xcite , which is population - size independent , is shown to be a landscape .",
    "this _ transient landscape _ has a lyapunov property with respect to the corresponding deterministic replicator dynamics , providing a potential - like function for visualizing the transient stochastic dynamics .",
    "ideas related to the transient landscape of moran process have been discussed in the past : claussen and traulsen @xcite studied non - gaussian stochastic fluctuations based on the conditional stationary distribution .",
    "it is also a general feeling that one can use the negative logarithm of the stationary , or conditional stationary distribution as the potential in evolutionary dynamics , following an analogue to boltzmann s law in statistical mechanics .",
    "however , it is important to point out that a stationary distribution usually collapses to singular supports in the infinite population limit , while our large deviation rate function @xmath0 is supported on the whole space and it is independent of system s size . therefore , in terms of the analogue to boltzmann s law , we are effectively identifying the system s size as the inversed temperature which tends to infinity for a deterministic limit .",
    "even though our analysis is based on the one - dimensional moran process , this idea is general .",
    "it can be applied to many other multi - dimensional evolutionary game dynamics with finite populations , with or without detailed balance @xcite . for the latter case",
    ", the landscape itself is an _",
    "emergent property _ of the dynamics . with respect to moran process",
    ", @xcite also discovered the expression of @xmath0 from a different origin , via their approximated calculation of fixation probability for large population size .",
    "we shall show that this connection is a nice mathematical property of the @xmath0 function for the processes in one - dimensional case , but its generalization to multi - dimensional cases is not obvious . more specifically , for multi - dimensional systems with multiple alleles , the fixation probability does not naturally give a landscape .",
    "the large deviation rate function , however , can be generalized to multi - dimensional markov processes , as indicated by the freidlin - wentzell theory @xcite .",
    "the landscape we introduced is also consistent with the landscape theory for other population dynamics , e.g. , chemical , that is ergodic without fixation @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamentally different types of movements in this landscape that require separated attention .",
    "( @xmath1 ) `` downhill movements '' which have deterministic counterparts : the local minima ( _ transient attractors _ ) in this landscape correspond to the stable points in the replicator dynamics @xcite .",
    "that is , these transient attractors are in direct agreement with the _ evolutionarily stable strategies _",
    "( esss ) @xcite .",
    "( @xmath2 ) `` uphill movements '' which are rare and without a deterministic correspondence .",
    "in general , rare events take exponentially long time ; one needs to take multiple time scales into consideration in understanding the appropriate fluctuation descriptions for the transient dynamics as well as eventual fixation .",
    "this is particularly relevant in the anti - coordination games .",
    "furthermore , the concept of _ stochastic bistability _ is studied in the coordination games . in this case , the downhill and uphill movements in the landscape dominate `` intra - attractoral '' and `` inter - attractoral '' dynamics respectively @xcite .",
    "it is shown that a maxwell - type construction from classic phase transition theory in statistical physics @xcite is necessary as the population size tends to infinity , i.e. , only one of attractors should be singled out in such a construction | it corresponds to the global minimum of the landscape .",
    "this is not present in the bistable deterministic dynamics ; it raises the novel issue of _ ultimate fixation_. it did not escape our notice that it is the _ exponentially long - time search _ that ultimately finds the global minimum in a `` non - convex optimization '' @xcite .",
    "another important issue directly relating to the transient dynamics is the diffusion approximation @xcite . with the conventional truncation of kramers - moyal ( km ) expansion",
    ", the discrete stochastic moran process for large populations has been approximated by a stochastic differential equation @xcite , with absorbing dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "if one replaces the absorbing boundary conditions with the reflecting ones , we can also derive an ergodic stationary distribution from the fokker - planck equation of this diffusion process .",
    "it will be shown that this stationary distribution is in fact the `` conditional '' stationary distribution for the process with absorbing boundary conditions . in a comparison of the transient dynamics between the original moran process and its continuous counterpart",
    ", it is shown that even though the km diffusion is valid in finite time as a local dynamical approximation , it could lead to incorrect approximation in global inter - attractoral dynamics .",
    "in bistable game systems , particularly , the km diffusion could single out a different stable point from that of the original process for large but finite populations .",
    "moreover , enlightened by hnggi et al.s work @xcite , we also consider their diffusion approximation that provides the correct global dynamics .",
    "however , this diffusion process gives incorrect finite time stochastic dynamics .",
    "now we have a _ diffusion s dilemma _ : the truncated km diffusion gives the correct finite time stochastic dynamics as the original moran process with large population size ( this is guaranteed both by the so called van kampen s system size expansion @xcite and kurtz s theorem @xcite ) , but wrong stationary distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "hnggi et al.s diffusion , which is unique in providing the correct stationary distribution as well as deterministic limit , is wrong for the finite time stochastic dynamics . to further illustrate this diffusion s dilemma ,",
    "a simple example is present . by investigating the first passage times",
    ", it is found that the failure of exponential approximation in the uphill movement could be the origin of the difficulties of diffusion approximation . in other words ,",
    "diffusion approximation is a second - order polynomial expansion for the kolmogorov forward equation of the original discrete process , which can give the correct gaussian dynamics near the stable point ; however , the inter - attractoral global dynamics , determined by the barrier crossing events with exponential small probabilities , should be approximated in the level of exponential asymptotics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the frequency - dependent moran process .",
    "then we give the transient description of the moran process in sec .",
    "iii , where the transient landscape @xmath0 is constructed .",
    "it is shown that this landscape as a `` glue '' holds the deterministic replicator dynamics , the fixation and the problem of maxwell - type construction together .",
    "diffusion s dilemma is discussed in sec .",
    "the discussions are included in the last section .",
    "to study evolutionary game theory in finite populations , nowak et al .",
    "@xcite generalized moran s classical population genetic model @xcite by using frequency - dependent fitness .",
    "consider a population of @xmath3 individuals playing a symmetric @xmath4 game with strategies @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the payoff matrix is @xmath7 where all the entries in the matrix are assumed to be non - negative . if @xmath1 players follow strategy @xmath5 , and @xmath8 play @xmath6 , the the average payoff of an individual of @xmath5 is @xmath9 where self - interaction is excluded , and also for @xmath6 is @xmath10 fitness is assumed to be a linear combination of background fitness and the payoff as follows : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] denotes the intensity of selection .    at each time step ,",
    "one individual is chosen to reproduce proportional to its fitness , then the offspring replaces a randomly chosen individual , so that the population size is constant . the evolutionary mechanism in this moran process , thus , can be conveniently described as a markov chain . if we denote @xmath14 as the the number of individuals following strategy @xmath5 , then @xmath14 is actually a finite - state birth - death process with discrete - time steps , which can be expressed as follows : @xmath15 where the birth and death probabilities conditional on the present state @xmath16 are @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 so the markov transition probability matrix of this process can be denoted as @xmath20 it is easy to see that @xmath21 and @xmath3 are two absorbing boundaries for the system , so the limiting distribution of the moran process can be denoted as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fixation probability that @xmath1 individuals of strategy @xmath5 succeed in taking over the entire population , and @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) is a dirac mass at @xmath26 ( or @xmath3 ) . in other words , except for the two pure - strategic absorbing states , all the mixed states are transient .",
    "this process is different from an irreducible markov chain whose ergodic behavior is supported on the whole state space .",
    "thus in the moran process , it is natural to investigate the conditions for selection to favor successful fixation by calculating the corresponding fixation probabilities @xcite .",
    "the fixation is intimately dependent upon the transient behavior before absorption . to show this",
    ", we shall divide the process to fixation into two parts : one is the irreducible transitions among the transient states before absorption , the other is the last step to fixation .",
    "this distinction has a very clear evolutionary meaning : the former is a consequence of `` global dynamics '' while the latter is a rather local event .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that these two scenarios correspond so - called `` golf - course search '' and `` funnel perspective '' in the field of protein folding @xcite . by explicitly studying these two different problems ,",
    "one is able to address the `` dynamic nature of fixation '' : is the dynamics toward fixation inherent in the evolutionary dynamics ?",
    "the investigation of the transients provides another perspective to understand the fixation .",
    "further , in order to describe the inherent fluctuations arising from finite populations , the transient dynamics has been proved to be an essential explanatory aspect @xcite .      a natural mathematical idea to describe",
    "the transient behavior is to concentrate on the distribution conditional on the subspace of the mix - strategic states @xcite .",
    "we consider an auxiliary process @xmath27 close to the original moran process @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath27 can be described as the original process with the absorbing states removed , while all other birth and death probabilities remain unchanged @xcite .",
    "so the process of @xmath27 can be expressed as @xmath29 note that @xmath27 is an ergodic markov chain with a unique stationary distribution @xmath30 , yielding the following iterative relation @xmath31    the interpretation of @xmath32 for the transient description of the original process @xmath28 is from the theory of quasi - stationarity @xcite .",
    "it is shown that @xmath32 characterizes the occupation time distribution of the process before absorption , i.e. @xmath33 is the average times of visiting to @xmath1 divided by the mean absorbing time ( see appendix a ) .",
    "so we call @xmath32 the _ conditional stationary distribution _ of the original process .      for the replicator equation @xmath40,\\ ] ] it is easy to check that @xmath41x(1-x)[((a - b)x+b)-((c - d)x+d)]\\\\ & \\leq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath0 has the _ lyapunov property _",
    "@xcite , i.e. the dynamical behavior of the replicator dynamics can be predicted by this transient landscape .",
    "note that by our definition of @xmath0 , the lyapunov property is nearly transparent , even for multi - dimensional systems ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we classify the transient landscape into three main generic cases ( see fig .",
    "1 ) :    \\1 ) _ uni - well _ : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . @xmath0 decreases on @xmath44 $ ] and increases on @xmath45 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath46 is the only minimal extreme point .",
    "\\2 ) _ uni - barrier _ : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath0 increases on @xmath44 $ ] and decreases on @xmath45 $ ] . in this case",
    ", the landscape has two local minimal points at both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , separated by the peak at @xmath51 .",
    "\\3 ) _ uphill / downhill _ : @xmath42 and @xmath48 ( or @xmath47 and @xmath43 ) . in this case , @xmath0 increases ( or decreases ) on the whole interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath53 ( or x=0 ) is the minimal point .",
    "another seemingly trivial case is when @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which is of limited interest in the deterministic dynamics .",
    "however , this neutral case with _ flat _",
    "landscape becomes important in the context of stochastic dynamics .",
    "an interesting result will be obtained for this case in connection to diffusion approximation ( sec .",
    "[ diff_app ] ) .",
    "note that the rescaled conditional stationary distribution @xmath56 can be expressed as @xmath57 the landscape @xmath0 visualizes the transient dynamics : the transient system should spend a majority of time around local minimal point(s ) in the landscape .",
    "so we term the minimal point(s ) as the _ transient attractor(s)_. in the literature of physics , the transient attractor(s ) show the properties of _ metastablity _ @xcite .",
    "that is , although the `` downhill movement '' towards the local minimum in the landscape maintains the stability of the attractor , the `` uphill movement '' of crossing the barrier will drive the system to move from the local attractor to another on a larger time scale . with this observation , we will discuss the fixation from the viewpoint of the transient landscape .",
    "it is known that the process to fixation is intimately dependent upon both the transient movements before absorption and the one last step to fixation .",
    "thus we have two cases : first , the fixation is an inherent result derived directly from the transient process .",
    "second , the fixation shows distinctly different behavior from the transient process , i.e. , the final fixation does not end up with attractive absorbing , but one last `` unnatural '' step to fixation .",
    "based on the different generic cases of the transient landscape , it is found that in the _ uphill _ or _ downhill _ case , one of the two absorbing states is located at the transient attractor , we term this kind of absorbing state as the _ attractive absorbing state _ ; the other absorbing state is called as the _ rare absorbing state_. this classification of the absorbing states is directly linked to the work by antal et al .",
    "we now denote the probability of fixation at @xmath3 , before reaching @xmath26 and starting from the initial state @xmath1 , by @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , fixation probability at @xmath26 starting from @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath23 , for example , can be derived from the following difference equation @xcite : @xmath59 with two boundary conditions @xmath60 then we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 . when @xmath3 is sufficiently large @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 eq .",
    "( [ eq_16 ] ) establishes a connection between our the transient landscape with fixation probability . as pointed out by @xcite , in the _ downhill",
    "_ case that @xmath47 and @xmath43 , @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 this result shows that the uphill fixation from @xmath69 to @xmath26 is a rare event with exponentially small probability , while the downhill fixation from @xmath26 to @xmath69 is a rather easy trip .",
    "this corresponds to our `` rare '' or `` attractive '' definition of the absorbing states .",
    "similarly , in the _ uni - barrier _ case , both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the attractive absorbing states , whereas the barrier crossing probability from each side to another is exponentially small .",
    "in the _ uni - well _ case , however , the only transient attractor is located at the mixed state @xmath51 . in this case , the fixation is not an immediate result of the transient attraction .",
    "antal et al .",
    "@xcite shows that the fixation time in this case is exponentially large with population size @xmath3 ; while in the other two cases the fixation times have the same approximated order @xmath70 .",
    "this result is also completely in line with our classification of the fixation .",
    "the mismatch between the mixed transient attractor and the final absorbing fixation leads to multiple time scales issue in the process of evolution .",
    "comparative studies of the mean first passage time to the attractor @xmath51 and the fixation time have been carried out in @xcite , showing the separation of the transient attractive time scale and the fixation time scale .",
    "multiple time scales issue is of great importance in understanding evolutionary systems @xcite , especially in explaining the coexistence and extinction of species in ecological systems @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the relevant time scale to explain the coexistence of species in plankton @xcite is found in the short term ( within a single season in their models ) .",
    "the time until species being extinct can be much longer than a single season .",
    "accordingly , the coexistence can be explained here as a transient phenomenon .",
    "the mixed transient attractor , as the stable equilibrium in the transient dynamics , should be more relevant within a reasonable time scale . to realize the final fixation , the system has to escape from the attractor through going uphill on the landscape , collecting many unfavorable moves consecutively , for an extremely long time .",
    "bistability ( or multistability ) is one of the most interesting phenomena in the nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the replicator dynamics @xmath40,\\ ] ] bistability arises when @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are both stable , separated by the unstable fixed point @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the characterizations of the bistability in the deterministic nonlinear systems should contain two things : one is _ where the attractors are _ , the other is the _ basins of attraction_.    one major problem in evolutionary game theory is the selection of multiple evolutionary stable strategies @xcite . in the bistability case of the deterministic dynamics ,",
    "the limiting behavior is determined by its initial state .",
    "that is , the measurement of the stability is closely dependent on the basins of attraction .",
    "the stable point with the larger basin of attraction can be seen as the _ risk - dominant _ strategy .    in the context of stochastic evolutionary game dynamics",
    ", we can also discuss the noise - induced bistable phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the bistability in the replicator dynamics corresponds to the _ uni - barrier _ case in the transient landscape , where both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the local minimal points in this landscape , separated by the barrier @xmath51 .",
    "we term this case with two transient attractors as the _",
    "stochastic bistability_. furthermore , not only does the landscape cover the characterizations of the bistability in the replicator dynamics , but we can also give a straightforward comparison to these two stable states based on this landscape . from eq .",

    "the perspective of multiple time - scale dynamics in the previous section provides a better understanding of this important problem .",
    "the insights we gained from the transient descriptions leads naturally to a comparative study of the original discrete - state moran process and its continuous - path counterpart .",

    "we should note that , for the bistable systems , the maxwell - type constructions are determined by the jump processes between these two attractors ( back and forth ) , which are both rare events with exponentially long time to happen . according to the above disparity between @xmath123 and @xmath142 in the uphill dynamics",
    ", km diffusion approximation can not give the exponent correctly , and then results in representing the inter - attractoral dynamical inaccurately .",

    "( [ fpe ] ) correctly approximates the finite - time moran process for large but finite populations , whereas it is not guaranteed that they share the same long - term stationary behavior .",
    "therefore , the difficulty encountered by km s diffusion in bistable game systems stems from the fact that exchanging the limits of population size and time is problematic .",
    "it concerns with non - uniform convergence of kurtz s result .",
    "a natural question is whether one can find a diffusion process that gives both satisfactory finite - time and stationary dynamical approximation .",
    "hnggi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a very different diffusion process in the context of chemical master equation : @xmath148 the heuristic derivation of eq .",
    "( [ fpe-2 ] ) is based on onsager s theory .",
    "then the stochastic potential for the system should be the transient landscape @xmath0 , and the _ thermodynamic force _ is @xmath149 therefore , the macroscopic ordinary differential equation should be @xmath150 so @xmath151 and the diffusion coefficient proportional to @xmath152 . in order to distinguish hnggi et al.s from km s , we term eq .",
    "( [ fpe-2 ] ) as hgtt s diffusion .",
    "it is easy to show that eq .",
    "( [ fpe-2 ] ) gives the same large deviation function as the original moran process .",
    "moreover , by comparing the drift coefficients of ( [ fpe ] ) and ( [ fpe-2 ] ) , @xmath153 hgtt s and km s describe the same ode when @xmath3 tends to infinity . for the diffusion coefficients : @xmath154 @xmath155 it is easy to find that hgtt s diffusion coefficient is always smaller than that of km s ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , except @xmath156 when @xmath139 near @xmath51 . so away from the extremal point , hgtt s diffusion shows different finite - time stochastic dynamics from km s .",
    "note that km s diffusion gives the correct finite - time dynamical approximation of the original moran process , hgtt s could then show a wrong short - term dynamics for most of the initial states .",
    "therefore , our diffusion dilemma can be stated as follows : can we find an approximated diffusion process correctly describe the whole three dynamical regimes : ( a ) the deterministic limit ; ( b ) the short time stochastic dynamics ; ( c ) long time global dynamics ?",
    "for truncated km approximation ( and van kampen s expansion ) , the ( a ) and ( b ) are correct for each and very attractor , but ( c ) is wrong . for hgtt s diffusion , ( a ) and ( c )",

    "stochastic dynamics have become a fundamental theory in understanding darwinian evolutionary theory @xcite . besides _ nonlinearity _ , _",
    "stochasticity _ has been shown as another basic feature of complexity in biological world @xcite , especially within the scale of cellular dynamics @xcite .",
    "stochastic evolutionary game dynamics , as _ agent - based _ models to describe the kinetics in polymorphic population systems , offer a framework to study the _ frequency - dependent selection _ in evolution .",
    "the present paper discuss the well - mixed stochastic evolutionary game dynamics from the viewpoint of the _ transients_. the transient landscape , as a potential - like representation of the pre - fixation dynamics , has been constructed via the conditional stationary distribution in the theory of quasi - stationarity in terms of the large deviation rate function .",
    "the involvement of large deviation theory from probability is essential here , for without it , the landscape would be system s size dependent .",
    "it has been shown that this transient landscape can play a central role in connecting the deterministic replicator dynamics , the final fixation behavior and diffusion approximation . as a lyapunov function of the replicator dynamics",
    ", the transient landscape visually captures the infinite - population nonlinear behavior .",
    "the downhill movements in this landscape corresponds to the dynamics of its deterministic counterpart , whereas the rare uphill movements arising from the random fluctuations are of more interest in stochastic evolutionary systems . to capture the eventual fixation behavior from the transient perspective",
    ", we have classified the absorbing states into two cases : the attractive absorbing state which is located at the transient attractor ; the other rare absorbing state which is located at the top of the landscape .",
    "the former is an inherent result of the transient downhill dynamics , while the latter is related to the multiple time scale issue , that is , the final fixation time scale is separated from the transient coexistence quasi - stationarity .",
    "furthermore , the maxwell - type construction and diffusion approximation are both important problems linking to the transient dynamics .",
    "the maxwell - type construction is a global description of nonlinear bistable stochastic dynamics , which is not present in deterministic dynamics .",
    "this construction always searches the global minimum in the landscape , so it is a direct result of inter - attractoral dynamics .",
    "the comparison of the maxwell - type constructions between the original transient landscape and its diffusion counterpart indicates that the truncated km diffusion approximation could result in different global dynamics , that is , the original moran process for large populations and its diffusion counterpart could select different global stable points . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "another hgtt s diffusion has been constructed for giving the correct long - term asymptotic dynamics .",
    "however , this diffusion gives the wrong finite time stochastic dynamics .    by investigating the first passage times in the simple birth - death process",
    ", it has been found that the failure of exponential approximation in the uphill movement could be a reason for our diffusion s problem .",
    "mathematically , the diffusion approximation is just a second - order polynomial expansion of the master equation , which only offers the second - order precision for the original process .",
    "accordingly , this approach can give the correct deterministic dynamics ( first order ) and gaussian dynamics near the stable point ( second - order ) .",
    "however , the inter - attractoral dynamics is determined by the rare barrier crossing movements with exponentially small probabilities , so the maxwell - type construction should be approximated in the level of exponential asymptotics , which could be out of any finite order expansions league . in the theory of probability , this is the domain of the large deviation theory @xcite .",
    "it is believed that discrete stochastic dynamics offers a new perspective on biological dynamics . besides the conventional concentrations on maximum - likelihood events , more attention should be paid to _",
    "rare events_. evolution itself is a process with the accumulations of various rare events , such as genetic or epigenetic mutations and ecological catastrophes .",
    "so the stochasticity is not just fluctuations near the most probable macroscopic states , but an important source of complexity , i.e. , `` innovation '' , especially on an evolutionary time scale .",

    "we only consider the former , see @xcite for more details .    in order to introduce the conditional stationary distribution ,",
    "we now add small mutations to the original moran process as follows : @xmath157 @xmath158 in this case , the process has become irreducible .",

    "the idea of vk expansion is that , in large population size @xmath3 , the number we are interested in ( e.g. the number of strategy @xmath5 ) is expected to consist of two parts : deterministic and fluctuations parts .",

    "<S> agent - based stochastic models for finite populations have recently received much attention in the game theory of evolutionary dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> both the ultimate fixation and the pre - fixation transient behavior are important to a full understanding of the dynamics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the transient dynamics of the well - mixed moran process through constructing a _ landscape _ function . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the landscape playing a central theoretical `` device '' that integrates several lines of inquiries : the stable behavior of the replicator dynamics , the long - time fixation , and continuous diffusion approximation associated with asymptotically large population . </S>",
    "<S> several issues relating to the transient dynamics are discussed : 1 ) multiple time scales phenomenon associated with intra- and inter - attractoral dynamics ; 2 ) discontinuous transition in stochastically stationary process akin to maxwell construction in equilibrium statistical physics ; and 3 ) the dilemma diffusion approximation facing as a continuous approximation of the discrete evolutionary dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that _ rare events _ with exponentially small probabilities , corresponding to the uphill movements and barrier crossing in the landscape with multiple wells that are made possible by strong nonlinear dynamics , plays an important role in understanding the origin of the complexity in evolutionary , nonlinear biological systems .    </S>"
