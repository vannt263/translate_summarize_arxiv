    "the first exact results @xcite for the o(@xmath0 ) critical properties were obtained for a model on the honeycomb lattice , and revealed not only the critical point , but also some universal parameters of the critical state , as well as the low - temperature phase , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the derivation of these results depends on a special choice of the o(@xmath0)-symmetric interaction between the @xmath0-component spins of the o(@xmath0 ) model , which enables a mapping on a loop gas @xcite .",
    "these results were supposed to apply to a whole universality class of o(@xmath0)-symmetric models in two dimensions .    since then , also o(@xmath0 ) models on the square and triangular lattices were investigated @xcite .",
    "indeed , branches were found with the same universal properties as the honeycomb model , but in addition to these , several other branches of critical behavior were reported . among these , we focus on ` branch 0 ' as reported in refs .",
    "the points on this branch appear to describe a higher critical point . for @xmath4 ,",
    "it can be identified with the so - called @xmath5 point @xcite describing the collapse of a polymer in two dimensions , which has been interpreted as a tricritical o(@xmath4 ) model .",
    "it has indeed been found that the introduction of a sufficiently strong and suitably chosen attractive potential between the loop segments changes the ordinary o(@xmath4 ) transition into a first - order one @xcite , such that this change precisely coincides with the @xmath4 point of branch 0 .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 point plays the role of a tricritical o(@xmath4 ) transition .",
    "furthermore , it has been verified that tricriticality in the o(@xmath0 ) model can be introduced by adding a sufficient concentration of vacancies into the system @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the introduction of vacancies leads to a branch of higher critical points , of which the points @xmath4 and @xmath7 belong to universality classes ( of the @xmath5 point and the tricritical blume - capel model respectively ) that have been described earlier as tricritical points .    however , the critical points of branch 0 on the square lattice appear to display universal properties that are different from those of the branch of higher critical points of the o(@xmath0 ) model with vacancies @xcite , except at the intersection point of the two branches at @xmath4 .",
    "it thus appears that the continuation of the @xmath5 point at @xmath4 to @xmath8 can be done in different ways , leading to different universality classes . in order to gain further insight in this situation",
    ", the present work considers an o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the kagome lattice with the purpose to find a @xmath5-like point , to continue this point to @xmath8 and to explore the resulting universality .",
    "the partition function of the spin representation of @xmath1-state potts model on the honeycomb lattice @xmath9 depends on the temperature @xmath10 by the coupling @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the nearest - neighbor spin - spin interaction .",
    "the spins @xmath13 can assume values 1 , 2 , @xmath14 , @xmath1 and their index @xmath15 labels the sites of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the first summation is over all possible spin configurations @xmath16 , and the second one is over the nearest neighbor spin pairs .",
    "this potts model can be subjected to a series of mappings which lead , via the random - cluster model and a fully - packed loop model , to a dilute o(@xmath0 ) loop model which can also be interpreted as an o(@xmath0 ) spin model .",
    "the introduction of bond variables , and a summation on the spin variables map the potts model onto the random - cluster ( rc ) model @xcite , with partition function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of bonds , @xmath19 the number of clusters , and @xmath20 the weight of a bond .",
    "the sum is on all configurations @xmath21 of bond variables : each bond variable is either 1 ( present ) or 0 ( absent ) . in eq .",
    "( [ zrc ] ) , @xmath1 can be considered a continuous real number , playing the role of the weight of a cluster . here ,",
    "a cluster is either a single site or a group of sites connected together by bonds on the lattice . a typical configuration of the rc model on the honeycomb lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ mapping ] .",
    "the next step is a mapping of the rc model on the honeycomb lattice onto a fully packed loop ( fpl ) model on the kagome lattice , which proceeds similarly as in the case of the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the sites of fpl model sit in the middle of the edges of the honeycomb lattice , and thus form a kagome lattice @xcite .",
    "fully packed here means that all edges of the kagome lattice are covered by loop segments .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between these two configurations is established by requiring that the loops do not intersect the occupied edges ( bonds ) of the honeycomb rc model , and always intersect the empty edges , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mapping ] .     according to eq .",
    "( [ zrc ] ) , and that of the corresponding fpl configuration is @xmath22 according to eq .",
    "( [ zfpl ] ) . ]    to specify the boltzmann weights of the fpl model , we assign a weight @xmath0 to each loop , a weight @xmath23 to each vertex where the loop segments do not intersect an edge which is occupied by a bond of the rc model , and a weight @xmath24 to each vertex where the loop segments intersect an edge which is empty in the rc model , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 2vs ] .    .",
    "the weight of a vertex where two loops intersect an unoccupied edge ( dashed line ) is @xmath24 . ]    the partition function of the fpl model on the kagome lattice is thus defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of type-1 vertices , @xmath27 is the number of type-2 vertices and @xmath28 the number of loops .",
    "the sum is on all configurations @xmath29 of loops covering all the edges of the kagome lattice .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between rc configurations and fpl configurations makes it possible to express the configuration parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the fpl in those of the rc model , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "each vertex of type-1 corresponds with a bond of the rc model on the honeycomb lattice , thus @xmath30 the total number of the two kinds of vertices is equal to the number of edges on the honeycomb lattice , i.e. , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total number of sites of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "here we ignore surface effects of finite lattices .",
    "furthermore , a loop on the kagome lattice is either one surrounding a random cluster on the honeycomb lattice , or one following the inside of a loop formed by the bonds of a random cluster .",
    "thus @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the loop number of the rc model . together with the euler relation @xmath35 eqs .  ( [ e1 ] ) to ( [ e3 ] ) yield the numbers of vertices and loops on the kagome lattice",

    "next we map the fpl model on the kagome lattice onto a dilute loop ( dl ) model on the same lattice , using a method due to nienhuis ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the partition function of the fpl model on the kagome lattice is slightly rewritten as @xmath40^{m_l } \\label{zfpl2}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "( [ zfpl2 ] ) invites an interpretation in terms of colored loops , say red with loops of weight @xmath43 and green loops of weight 1 .",
    "each of the @xmath44 terms in the expansion of @xmath45^{m_l}$ ] thus specifies a way to color the loops : @xmath46^{m_l}=\\sum _ { \\{\\rm colorings\\}}(n-1)^{l_r}1^{l_g } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the number of red loops and green loops respectively , @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 denote a graph @xmath29 in which the colors of all loops are specified .",
    "the partition sum can thus be expressed in terms of a summation over all colored loop configurations @xmath50 .",
    "the vertices of the kagome lattice are visited by two colored loops , and can thus be divided into 6 types , shown in fig .",
    "[ 6vs ] with their associated weights @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ zfpl2 ] ) assumes the form @xmath53 the sum @xmath54 on all colored loop configurations may now be replaced by two nested sums , the first of which is a sum @xmath55 on all dilute loop configurations of red loops , and the second sum @xmath56 is on all configurations of green loops @xmath57 that are consistent with @xmath58 , i.e. , the green loop configurations that cover all the kagome edges not covered by a red loop .",
    "thus @xmath59 for each vertex visited by green loops only , there are precisely two possible local loop configurations . since the loop weight of the green loops is 1 , the summation over such pairs of configurations is trivial : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of green - only vertices .",
    "the fpl partition sum thus reduces to that of a dilute loop model , involving only red loops of weight @xmath43 : @xmath62 where the partition function of the dilute loop model is defined as @xmath63 in which we forget the color variable , and denote the number of loops in a dilute configuration @xmath64 as @xmath34 .",

    "there are two possible configurations ( a ) and ( b ) , of which the relative weights are @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",

    "this implies that there is an equivalent o(@xmath0 ) spin model : @xmath69 of which the local weights have the same relation with the vertex weights as for the square lattice model of ref .",
    "thus , the partition sum of the spin model is expressed by @xmath70 \\prod_{v } [ 1 + x_1 ( \\vec{s}_{v1}\\cdot\\vec{s}_{v2}+ \\vec{s}_{v3}\\cdot\\vec{s}_{v4})+ \\mbox{\\hspace{10 mm}}\\ ] ] @xmath71 \\ , .",

    "the label @xmath76 runs clockwise around each vertex , such that the spins @xmath77 and @xmath78 sit on the same side of the honeycomb edge passing through vertex @xmath72 .",
    "the spins have @xmath0 cartesian components and are normalized to length @xmath79 .",
    "there are two different notations for each spin ( because each spin is adjacent to two vertices ) , but a given subscript @xmath74 refers to only one spin . here",
    "the number @xmath0 is restricted to positive integers , of which only the case @xmath7 is expected to be critical .      since the critical point of the rc model on the honeycomb lattice is known @xcite as a function of @xmath1 , namely @xmath80 the corresponding critical point of the @xmath81 fpl model on the kagome lattice is also known . according to eq .",

    "thus , the conformal anomaly and some of the critical exponents of the fpl and the dl models can be obtained from the existing results for the random - cluster model .",

    "<S> a critical dilute o(@xmath0 ) model on the kagome lattice is investigated analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a number of exact equivalences which , in a few steps , link the critical o(@xmath0 ) spin model on the kagome lattice to the exactly solvable critical @xmath1-state potts model on the honeycomb lattice with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate steps involve the random - cluster model on the honeycomb lattice , and a fully packed loop model with loop weight @xmath3 and a dilute loop model with loop weight @xmath0 , both on the kagome lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping enables the determination of a branch of critical points of the dilute o(@xmath0 ) model , as well as some of its critical properties . for @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces the known universal properties of the @xmath5 point describing the collapse of a polymer . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath6 it displays a line of multicritical points , with the same universal properties as a branch of critical behavior that was found earlier in a dilute o(@xmath0 ) model on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are supported by a finite - size - scaling analysis in combination with transfer - matrix calculations . </S>"
