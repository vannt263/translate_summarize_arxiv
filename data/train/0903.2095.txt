    "the recent experimental advances in the manipulation of single molecules , such as optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy together with single - molecule fluorescence @xcite , have enabled us to carry out mechanical and relaxational measurement in the nano - scale with piconewton sensitivity @xcite in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "for example , static force - extension measurements of stretching of a single polymer chain have been carried out @xcite . as a non - equilibrium dynamics , the viscoelastic properties or the elastic and dissipative properties",
    "have also been studied @xcite .",
    "such experiments have revealed more detailed properties of single molecules that are difficult to obtain in bulk experiments due to the average taken over molecules and time .",
    "therefore , these investigations lead to better understanding of the hierarchical structure of soft matter and the relationship between the molecular morphology and the functionality of biological molecules @xcite .    one of the characteristic features of soft matter such as polymers or membranes is that they often have several length scales . even in a single polymer chain",
    "if the chain is semi - flexible , there are at least two length scales , i.e. , the persistence length and the total chain length . in the several experiments of single polymer chains , the semiflexibility , i.e. , the stiffness , is an important factor @xcite .",
    "in fact , the wormlike - chain model , which is a model of a semiflexible polymer @xcite , explains many experimental results considerably better than the flexible polymer chain model @xcite particularly in the situation such as the highly - stretching limit in the force - extension measurement and the high wave - number limit of the dynamic structure factor , and so on @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the rigidity effect can be enhanced in the above limits even for flexible polymers with a weak stiffness and that discrepancy appears between experiments and the theory based on a purely flexible model @xcite .",
    "therefore , investigation of the nonlinear dynamics due to the stiffness is necessary not only for semiflexible polymers but also for flexible polymers .    despite the above fact as well as their fundamental interest in the field of mesoscopic physics and their importance to the material and biological application ,",
    "semiflexible polymer chains have not been studied intensively especially for the dynamics because of the strong nonlinearity contained in the wormlike - chain model .",
    "most of the theoretical studies of single polymers have been made in the limiting cases of either very flexible polymers or rigid rods @xcite .",
    "so far , computer simulations have been carried out for a stiff chain or a semiflexible chain @xcite .",
    "static theories of a semiflexible polymer chain are summarized as follows .",
    "marko and siggia derived the static force - extension relation based on the wormlike - chain model @xcite .",
    "other statistical properties , such as the distribution function of the end - to - end distance , have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "improvement of the wormlike - chain models has been proposed to examine the static properties @xcite .    on the other hand , as mentioned above , analytical approaches to non - equilibrium dynamics of a semiflexible single polymer chain are limited .",
    "some of the previous works have employed an approximation of linearization for the inextensibility constraint @xcite .",
    "this linearization neglects non - uniformity of the line tension along the chain and has been applied to stretched polymers @xcite .",
    "recently , hallatschek et al .",
    "@xcite have formulated the force - extension theory for the wormlike - chain dynamics without linearization of the inextensibility condition introducing the concept of tension propagation .",
    "they consider a weakly bend situation and use a kind of multi - scale perturbation methods .",
    "the theory has been applied to the relaxation of an elongated chain after removing an external force @xcite .",
    "finally , it is also mentioned that , as a previous theoretical method , the scaling approach to a semiflexible polymer chain @xcite , which was successful for flexible chains @xcite .    in the present paper , we develop the linear viscoelastic theory of a strongly pre - stretched single semiflexible polymer chain .",
    "we consider the situation such that an oscillatory force in addition to a constant force is applied to the two end of a wormlike - chain .",
    "based on the method by hallatschek et al .",
    "we derive the analytic representation of the complex compliance and the complex modulus .",
    "it will be shown that the frequency dependence is quite different from that of the rouse model @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results have been published in ref .",
    "we apply a scaling analysis to understand the physical insight of the results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we present the dynamical model of the wormlike - chain and the tension - propagation equation is derived based on the method by hallatschek et al .",
    "@xcite . in section [ sec : result ] , the complex compliance and the complex modulus are obtained analytically . in section [ sec",
    ": rouse ] , the compliance and the modulus in the rouse dynamics are given for comparison . in section [ sec :",
    "scaling ] , the scaling approach is applied to both the weak - bending wormlike - chain dynamics and the rouse dynamics .",
    "summary and discussion are given in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the wormlike - chain is given by @xcite @xmath8 with the constraint @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the time , @xmath11 is the length along the chain from one end , @xmath12 is the total length and @xmath13 represents the conformation of the chain .",

    "@xmath23 obeys the gaussian white statistics : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the boltzmann coefficient and @xmath26 the absolute temperature .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : dynamics1 ] ) is the same as that employed by liverpool @xcite .",
    "a remark is now in order .",
    "a stiff filament with an internal friction has been studied where the friction is supposed to arise from the internal conformation rearrangement of the filament with a finite radius @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized here that we have not introduced such an additional friction in eq [ eq : dynamics1 ] .",
    "as described below , the constraint eq [ eq : cons ] produces a strong nonlinear coupling between the longitudinal ( parallel to the external force ) and the transverse components of the conformation , which causes an energy dissipation whose magnitude is comparable with the typical elastic energy .",
    "now we follow the theory developed by hallatschek , frey and kroy @xcite .",

    "noting that the ratio of the relaxation rate of @xmath55 to that of @xmath56 is @xmath57 , one may apply an adiabatic approximation for @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , the local equilibrium approximation is employed such that the degrees of freedom in the length scale @xmath58 is relaxed for a given constraint for the larger scale @xmath59 . in this way",

    "the complex compliance is the fourier - laplace transform of the response function @xmath264 and hence @xmath265 .",
    "therefore , we have the following relation @xmath266 and @xmath267 .    in the intermediate time region @xmath268 with the crossover time @xmath269 defined through @xmath270 , hallatschek et al . have obtained @xcite @xmath271 for a pulling situation and @xmath272 for a release situation .",
    "we have no results corresponding to eq [ eq : pull ] since this contains a nonlinear effect of the applied force . on the other hand",
    ", the exponent 1/2 in eq [ eq : rele ] corresponds to eq [ eq : intermedexp ] in the present paper .",
    "actually one can verify that not only the exponent but also the coefficient in eq [ eq : rele ] is consistent with our result .",
    "this implies that the expression ( [ eq : rele ] ) is free from the nonlinearity between the force - strain relation .",
    "finally we mention a theoretical study which gives us the exponent 1/2 in the compliance .",
    "caspi et al .",
    "have investigated the mean square displacement of a single monomer of a prestressed semiflexible network @xcite .",
    "they have obtained @xmath273 where @xmath274 denotes the undulation amplitude , @xmath275 the line tension , @xmath276 the solvent viscosity and @xmath12 the total chain length .",
    "equation ( [ eq : caspi1 ] ) holds in the time region @xmath277 .",
    "furthermore , they have shown that the effective time dependent friction @xmath278 satisfies the generalized einstein relation @xmath279 combining eqs [ eq : caspi1 ] and [ eq : caspi2 ] , one obtains the complex compliance ( @xmath280 ) @xmath281 some experiments of semiflexible networks support the exponent 1/2 @xcite .",
    "it is mentioned , however , that the physical of this result is different from our present result for semi - flexible chain given by eq [ eq : intermedexp ] .",
    "this fact is clear because the coefficient in eq [ eq : caspi3 ] does not contain @xmath249 whereas our expression eq [ eq : intermedexp ] is proportional to @xmath248 .",
    "now we comment on the several effects which have not been considered in the present paper .",
    "the hydrodynamic effect has not been investigated quantitatively in a nonlinear wormlike - chain although it is expected to be not so strong in a strongly stretched semi - flexible chain .",
    "the previous studies of the hydrodynamic effect in the linearized wormlike - chain dynamics @xcite should be extended to apply to the present theory .",
    "the internal friction considered in the rouse dynamics @xcite should also be extended to the semi - flexible chains .",
    "in addition , the helical wormlike - chain model , which contains the torsional energy , has been studied in dilute solutions @xcite .",
    "this torsional effect may affect the viscoelastic properties of single polymer chains .    before closing this article",
    ", we make an estimation of the characteristic times @xmath157 and @xmath156 defined by eqs [ eq : taun ] and [ eq : tau ] respectively .",
    "the data for @xmath282-dna in an aqueous solution are as follows @xcite @xmath283 , \\notag \\\\   & l \\sim 20 [ \\text{$\\mu$m } ] , \\notag \\\\   & \\zeta _ { \\perp } \\sim 1.3 \\times 10^{-3 } [ \\text{pa s } ] = 1.3 \\times    10^{-3 } [ \\text{pn$\\cdot$s/$\\mu$m$^2 $ } ] \\ . \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for these values together with @xmath284 for a rigid rod @xcite and the room temperature @xmath285 $ ] , and for the external force @xmath286 $ ] the characteristic times are given by @xmath287 \\notag \\\\   & \\tau \\sim 6.0 \\times 10^{-5 } [ \\text{s } ] = 60 [ \\text{$\\mu$s } ] \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the constant @xmath288 .",
    "we expect that the frequency of the order of 60 [ ] is accessible by atomic force microscopy and that the present predictions can be detected experimentally .",
    "this work was supported by the grant - in - aid for priority area `` soft matter physics '' from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan .",
    "the scaling theory was completed during to s stay in institut fr festkrperforschung , jlich and in university of bayreuth . the financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation is gratefully acknowledged .",
