    "the possibility that our @xmath1 universe may be viewed as a brane hypersurface embedded in a higher dimensional bulk space has attracted considerable interest lately . a scenario with an infinite fifth dimension in the presence of a brane",
    "can generate a theory of gravity which mimics purely four - dimensional gravity , both with respect to the classical gravitational potential and with respect to gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the gravitational self - couplings are not significantly modified in this model .",
    "this result has been obtained from the study of a single 3-brane embedded in five dimensions , with the @xmath2 metric given by @xmath3 , which can produce a large hierarchy between the scale of particle physics and gravity due to the appearance of the warp factor @xcite .",
    "even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard @xmath1 gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "in contrast to the compactified case , this follows because the near - brane geometry traps the massless graviton .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time .",
    "the effective gravitational field equations on the brane - world , in which all the matter forces except gravity are confined on the 3-brane in a 5-dimensional space - time with @xmath4-symmetry have been obtained , by using an elegant geometric approach , in @xcite . the correct signature for gravity",
    "is provided by the brane with positive tension .",
    "if the bulk space - time is exactly anti - de sitter , then generically the matter on the brane is required to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "the electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor @xmath5 gives the leading order corrections to the conventional einstein equations on the brane .",
    "this implies a modification of the basic equations describing the cosmological and astrophysical dynamics , which has been extensively considered @xcite . for reviews of the dynamics and geometry of the brane universes , as well as for the discussions of the cosmological implications",
    "see @xcite .    according to standard cosmology , as it expanded and cooled ,",
    "the early universe is expected to have undergone a series of symmetry - breaking phase transitions , at which topological defects may have formed .",
    "phase transitions are labelled first or second order , according to whether the position of the vacuum state in field space changes discontinuously or continuously , as the critical temperature is crossed . a first order phase transition proceeds by bubble nucleation and expansion .",
    "when at least @xmath6 of these bubble collide , for @xmath7 , an @xmath8-dimensional topological defect may form in the region between them @xcite .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations for two quark flavors suggest that qcd makes a transition at a temperature of @xmath9 mev @xcite .",
    "this phase transition , which may have occurred in the early universe , could lead to the formation of relic quark - gluon plasma objects , which still survive today .",
    "a first order quark - hadron phase transition in the expanding universe can be described generically as follows @xcite .",
    "as the color deconfined quark - gluon plasma cools below the critical temperature @xmath10 mev , it becomes energetically favorable to form color confined hadrons ( primarily pions and a tiny amount of neutrons and protons , due to the conserved net baryon number ) .",
    "however , the new phase does not show up immediately . as is characteristic for a first order phase transition ,",
    "some supercooling is needed to overcome the energy expense of forming the surface of the bubble and the new hadron phase .",
    "when a hadron bubble is nucleated , latent heat is released , and a spherical shock wave expands into the surrounding supercooled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this reheats the plasma to the critical temperature , preventing further nucleation in a region passed by one or more shock fronts .",
    "generally , bubble growth is described by deflagrations , with a shock front preceding the actual transition front .",
    "the nucleation stops when the whole universe has reheated to @xmath11 .",
    "this part of the phase transition passes very fast , in about @xmath12 @xmath0s , during which the cosmic expansion is totally negligible .",
    "after that , the hadron bubbles grow at the expense of the quark phase and eventually percolate or coalesce .",
    "the transition ends when all quark - gluon plasma has been converted to hadrons , neglecting possible quark nugget production .",
    "the physics of the quark - hadron phase transition , as well as the cosmological implications of this process have been extensively discussed in the framework of general relativistic cosmology in @xcite - @xcite    in the context of brane - world scenarios , the friedmann equation contains deviations to the @xmath1 case , which results in an increased expansion in early times .",
    "this in general has important effects on the cosmological evolution , and in particular on cosmological phase transitions .",
    "first order phase transitions have also been considered , in the framework of the brane - world model , in @xcite . due to the effects coming from the extra - dimensions ,",
    "phase transitions require a higher nucleation rate to complete , and baryogenesis and particle abundances could be suppressed .",
    "the evolution of topological defects is also affected , but the increased expansion can not solve the monopole and domain wall problems .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the quark - hadron phase transition in the brane - world scenario . by assuming that the phase transition is of the first order",
    ", we study in detail the evolution of the relevant cosmological parameters ( energy density , temperature , scale factor , etc ) of the quark - gluon and hadron phases , and the phase transition itself .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in the early universe the energy density is high , so that one may neglect the terms linearly proportional to the energy density with respect to the quadratic terms .",
    "this is carried out in detail in this work .",
    "an important parameter to describe the phase transition is the hadron fraction , whose time evolution describes the conversion process .",
    "we also consider the effect of the dark radiation term on the phase transition .",
    "the brane world effects ( the quadratic corrections to the matter energy - momentum tensor , described by the numerical value of the brane tension , and the dark radiation term ) lead to an overall decrease of the temperature of the very early universe , and accelerate the transition to the pure hadronic phase .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in section [ secii ] ,",
    "we briefly outline , for self - completeness and self - consistency , the field equations in brane - world models and the basics of the quark - hadron phase transition . in the latter",
    ", we lay down the equations of state and the relevant physical quantities that are analyzed in the remaining sections . in section [ seciii ]",
    "we analyze in detail the quark - hadron phase transition . in section",
    "[ seciv ] , we consider bubble nucleation in the brane - world scenario , by assuming that the phase transition may be described by an effective nucleation theory . we discuss and summarize our results in section [ secv ] . in the present paper",
    "we use a system of units so that the speed of light is @xmath13 .",
    "in the brane - world models the effective four - dimensional gravitational field equations on the brane take the form @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the matter energy - momentum tensor on the brane and @xmath18 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the einstein equation in the bulk also implies the conservation of the energy momentum tensor of the matter on the brane @xcite . the first correction term relative to einstein s general relativity is the inclusion of a quadratic term @xmath19 in the energy - momentum tensor , arising from the extrinsic curvature terms in the projected einstein tensor , and is given by @xmath20 the second correction term , @xmath21 , is the projection of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor , @xmath22 , onto the brane , and is defined as @xmath23 , and encompasses nonlocal bulk effects .",
    "the only general known property of this nonlocal term is that it is traceless , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the symmetry properties of @xmath25 imply that in general we can decompose it irreducibly with respect to a chosen 4-velocity field @xmath26 as @xmath27 ,   \\label{wt}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 projects orthogonal to @xmath26 , @xmath29 is a scalar , @xmath30 a spatial vector and @xmath31 a spatial , symmetric and trace - free tensor , respectively . for homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type cosmological models",
    "@xmath32 @xcite , and hence the only non - zero contribution from the 5-dimensional weyl tensor from the bulk is given by the scalar term @xmath29 .",
    "there are several constraints which have been obtained for the brane tension @xmath33 .",
    "thus from big bang nucleosynthesis constraints it follows @xmath34 mev@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a much stronger bound for @xmath33 arises from null results of submillimeter tests of newton s law , giving @xmath36 gev@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "an astrophysical lower limit on @xmath33 , which is independent of the newton law and the cosmological limits has been derived in @xcite , leading to @xmath37 mev@xmath35 . in this work",
    ", we assume that the space - time geometry is the flat frw metric , given by @xmath38 for the matter energy - momentum tensor on the brane we restrict our analysis to the case of the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy density and isotropic pressure of the cosmological fluid on the brane , respectively .",
    "thus , the gravitational field equations , corresponding to the line element ( [ r6 ] ) become @xmath42    eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) can be immediately integrated to give the following general expression for the `` dark energy '' @xmath29 : @xmath43 with @xmath44 a constant of integration .      in this section",
    ", we outline the relevant physical quantities of the quark - hadron phase transition , which will be applied in the following sections in the context of the brane - world scenario .",
    "note that the scale of the cosmological qcd transition is given by the hubble radius @xmath45 at the transition , which is @xmath46 km , where @xmath47 is the critical temperature .",
    "the mass inside the hubble volume is @xmath48 .",
    "the expansion time scale is @xmath49 s , which should be compared with the timescale of qcd , @xmath50 fm / c@xmath51 s. even the rate of the weak interactions exceeds the hubble rate by a factor of @xmath52 . therefore , in this phase photons , leptons , quarks and gluons ( or pions ) are lightly coupled and may be described as a single , adiabatically expanding fluid @xcite .    in order to study the quark - hadron phase transition it is necessary to specify the equation of state of the matter , in both quark and hadron state .",
    "giving an equation of state is equivalent to give the pressure as a function of the temperature @xmath53 and chemical potential @xmath0 . at high temperatures the quark chemical potentials are equal , because weak interactions keep them in chemical equilibrium , and the chemical potentials for leptons are assumed to vanish .",
    "thus the chemical potential for a baryon is defined by @xmath54 .",
    "the baryon number density of an ideal fermi gas of three quark flavors is given by @xmath55 , leading to @xmath56 at @xmath57 . at low temperatures @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the assumption of a vanishing chemical potential at the phase transition temperature in both quark and hadron phase represents an excellent approximation for the study of the equation of state of the cosmological matter in the early universe .",
    "in addition to the strongly interacting matter , we assume that in each phase there are present leptons and relativistic photons , satisfying equations of state similar to that of hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "the equation of state of the matter in the quark phase can generally be given in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is the self - interaction potential .",

    "the form of the potential @xmath64 corresponds to a physical model in which the quark fields are interacting with a chiral field formed with the @xmath71 meson field and a scalar field .",
    "if the temperature effects can be ignored , the equation of state in the quark phase takes the form of the mit bag model equation of state , @xmath72 .",
    "results obtained in low energy hadron spectroscopy , heavy ion collisions and phenomenological fits of light hadron properties give @xmath73 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 mev @xcite .    in the hadron phase",
    "we take the cosmological fluid to consist of an ideal gas of massless pions and of nucleons described by the maxwell - boltzmann statistics , with energy density @xmath76 and pressure @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "the transition temperature is of the order @xmath85 mev .",
    "since the phase transition is of first order , all the physical quantities , like the energy density , pressure and entropy exhibit discontinuities across the critical curve .",
    "the ratio of the quark and hadron energy densities at the critical temperature , @xmath86 , is of the order of @xmath87 for @xmath83 mev and @xmath84 mev . if the temperature effects in the self - interaction potential @xmath64 are neglected , @xmath88 , then we obtain the well - known relation between the critical temperature and the bag constant , @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the quantities to be traced through the quark - hadron phase transition in the brane - world cosmological scenario are the energy density @xmath40 , the temperature @xmath53 and the scale factor @xmath90 .",

    "the fraction of hadronic matter stays very close to zero until the supercooling temperature is between @xmath205 and @xmath206 , then it jumps to @xmath50 very rapidly .",
    "the same behavior can be verified in the time dependent plot of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . the comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows clearly the difference between the first order phase transition and the supercooling . in the former",
    ", the hadronic fraction grows smoothly over a decade from zero to one , while in the latter it changes dramatically and almost instantaneously .",
    "physically , what happens is that , at a certain temperature below the critical value , an enormous amount of hadronic bubbles are nucleated almost everywhere in the plasma , which grow explosively to transform all the plasma into hadrons .",
    "the picture is similar to what happen in standard cosmology @xcite , in which the small supercooling phase transition is also very rapid with respect to the simple first order phase transition , at a temperature ( @xmath207 ) , which is very similar to the one we have obtained .",
    "another remarkable feature that is present in the supercooling scenario is the important dependence of the transition temperature on the brane tension , about @xmath208 difference between the lowest and the highest , which eventually leads to a different time at which the transition occurs .",
    "in the context of brane - world scenarios , in the high density cosmological phase the friedmann equation contains deviations to the @xmath1 case , which imposes fundamental phenomenological consequences on the cosmological evolution , and in particular on the cosmological phase transitions . in this work , we have analyze the evolution of the relevant physical quantities , namely , the energy density , temperature and scale factor before , during and after the phase transition .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in the early universe the energy density is extremely high , so that one can neglect the terms linearly proportional to the energy density with respect to the quadratic terms .",
    "this approximation has been considered in detail throughout this work . in the high density regime",
    "the hubble function is proportional to the energy density of the cosmological matter , which drastically affects the cosmological dynamics of the universe .",
    "moreover , in the early universe the dark radiation term , the projection of the weyl tensor from the bulk , which appears in form of a radiation - like term in the field equations , may also play an important role .",
    "the magnitude of the brane world effects can be characterized by the numerical value of the brane tension @xmath33 . in the limit @xmath209",
    "we recover standard general relativity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the quark - hadron phase transition is also very important from an observational point of view , since the inhomogeneities generated at the qcd phase transition might have a noticeable effect on nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "by fully taking into account the brane world effects we have found that the temperature evolution of the universe in the brane world scenario is different from the idealized standard frw model .",
    "the temperature of the early universe in the quark phase is smaller in the brane world scenario , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the long dashed curve corresponds ( approximately ) to the general relativistic limit .",
    "hence a small value of the brane tension would significantly reduce the temperature of the quark - gluon plasma , and accelerate the phase transition to the hadronic era .",
    "an increase of the dark radiation term for fixed bag constant @xmath66 and brane tension @xmath33 gives the same effect , as one can see from fig .",
    "once the quark - hadron phase transition starts , the hadron fraction @xmath153 is again strongly dependent on the brane tension . for small values of @xmath33",
    ", @xmath138 is much higher than in the standard general relativity , as one can see from fig .",
    "the increase of the dark radiation on the brane also strongly accelerates the formation of the hadronic phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and decreases the time interval necessary for the transition .",
    "a small brane tension and a high energy density of the dark radiation also tend to reduce the temperature of the hadronic fluid .",
    "of course , the temperature evolution also depends upon the relativistic degrees of freedom in the equation of state and upon the equation of state .",
    "in addition to this , by assuming that the phase transition may be described by an effective nucleation theory , we have also considered the case where the universe evolved through a mixed phase with a small initial supercooling , and monotonically growing hadronic bubbles .",
    "it was shown that at a certain temperature below the critical value , an enormous amount of hadronic bubbles are nucleated , which grow explosively to transform all the plasma into hadrons , indicating that the small supercooling phase transition is very rapid with respect to the simple first order phase transition .",
    "many details of the qcd phase transition are not yet conclusively understood .",
    "even the order of transition is still a matter of debate .",
    "an advance in the understanding of the numerical values of the qcd coupling constants would be very helpful in obtaining accurate cosmological conclusions .",
    "such an advance may also provide a powerful method for testing on a cosmological scale the theoretical predictions of the brane world models and the possible existence of the extra - dimensions .",
