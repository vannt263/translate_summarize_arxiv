    "thanks to the simultaneous recombination of the light arising from three telescopes , interferometers such as ionic-3 t on iota@xcite or amber on the vlti@xcite are providing closure phase measurements together with the modulus of the visibility .",
    "retrieval of phase information allows to scan the geometry of the source , hence opening the era of image reconstruction with infrared interferometric observations .",
    "however , with the current number of telescopes available , direct image restoration requires many successive nights of observations@xcite .",
    "thus , in most of the cases where the ( @xmath3 ) coverage spans a relatively small number of spatial frequencies , the measurements have still to be analyzed in the light of model - fitting techniques .    furthermore , together with partial correction by adaptive optics ( ao ) , many of the up - to - date interferometers are making use of waveguides that spatially filters the atmospheric corrugated wavefront , changing the turbulent phase fluctuations into random intensity variations@xcite .",
    "the estimators that describes the visibility and the closure phase measurements obtained with such interferometers have to account for the coupling between the partially corrected wavefront and the fiber . from these appropriate estimators",
    "one can derive the statistical properties of the observables and properly investigate the performances of single - mode interferometers .",
    "in section [ sec_theory ] we recall the spatial filtering properties of the waveguides in terms of interferometric signal and we define the estimators of both the modal visibility and the closure phase .",
    "we investigate in section [ sec_noise ] the covariance matrices of the observables with respect to atmospheric , photon and detector noises , paying particular attention to the correlation coefficients .",
    "then , defining in section [ sec_modelfit ] a general least square model fitting of the measurements , we analyze in section [ sec_applications ] the ability of fiber optic interferometers to measure stellar diameters .",
    "a full analysis of the signal arising from fiber optic interferometers has been theoretically described by mge@xcite and summarized by tatulli et al@xcite .",
    "we only recall here the important points for this paper , focusing on the coupling phenomenon between the incoming wavefront and the fiber , and on the observables that can be obtained from such interferometers .",
    "figure [ fig_recombineur ] sketches the principle of a fiber optic interferometer , and reports the main technical terms that will be used all along this paper .      introducing waveguides to carry /",
    "recombine the light in an interferometer allows to perform a spatial filtering of the incoming wavefront .",
    "it means that the phase corrugation of the wavefront are changed into intensity fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "the number of photometric and coherent ( interferometric ) photoevents at the output of the fibers depends on atmospheric fluctuations and results in the coupling between the turbulent wavefront and the fibers@xcite@xmath4@xcite .",
    "hence , spatial filtering can be seen as coupling coefficients , i.e. the fraction of ( respectively photometric and coherent ) light that is captured by the fibers .",
    "such coupling coefficients are mathematically described by the following equations@xcite@xmath4@xcite : @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the visibility of the source and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are resulting in respectively the auto - correlation and cross - correlation of the aberration - corrupted pupil weighted by the fiber single mode@xcite@xmath4@xcite  : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pupil function of the @xmath12 fiber optic telescope and @xmath13 is the aberration - corrupted wavefront incoming on the @xmath12 pupil . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively called the photometric and interferometric peaks .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of @xmath8 is called the photometric lobe ( or antenna lobe as commonly named in radio ) and the inverse fourier transform of @xmath9 is called the interferometric lobe .",
    "@xmath14 is the optimum coupling efficiency fixed by the fiber core design@xcite .    in the case where the source is unresolved by a single telescope",
    "( i.e. is much tighter than the photometric lobe ) , eq .",
    "[ eq_rhoi ] can be simplified : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the instantaneous strehl ratio@xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the visibility is constant over the range of the high frequency peak @xmath9 , the interferometric coupling coefficient has also a simplified expression : @xmath17 under these conditions , the effect of spatial filtering by the fibers in the interferometric equation and , as a result , in the observables , is entirely characterized by the instantaneous strehl ratio statistics .",
    "we refer to tatulli et al@xcite for a more complete description of the modal visibility .",
    "note however that the expression of the coherent flux at the spatial frequency @xmath18 is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number of photoevents of telescopes @xmath22 and @xmath23 before entering the fiber .",
    "an estimator of the modal visibility in the fourier space is given by the ratio of the coherent flux by the photometric ones , assuming the latter are estimated independently through dedicated photometric outputs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_recombineur ] ) : @xmath24 @xmath25 is the fraction of light selected for photometry at the output of the beam - splitter , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the photometric fluxes ( after the fibers ) .      by definition ,",
    "the closure phase is the phase of the so called image bispectrum @xmath28 .",
    "the latter consists in the ensemble average of the triple product .",
    "it can be expressed from eq .",
    "[ eq_fluxcoherent ] as : @xmath29 using roddier s formalism@xcite that demonstrated the bispectrum analysis to be a generalization to the optical of the well known phase closure method currently used in radio interferometry , it is straightforward to notice that the quantity @xmath30 is non zero if @xmath31 and that in this case : @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is proportional to the overlap area of three pupil images shifted apart by the spacings @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath31 , and @xmath37 is the bispectrum of the source .",
    "hence the modal bispectrum can be rewritten : @xmath38 thus , the modal bispectrum arising from fiber optic interferometers is the source bispectrum integrated over the overlap area @xmath39 .",
    "hence , as the modal visibility does not equal in general the object visibility , the modal bispectrum does not coincide with the source bispectrum .",
    "nevertheless , if the source spectrum is constant over the overlap area @xmath39 , eq .",
    "[ eq_modalbis ] takes a simplified form : @xmath40 in this case , the modal bispectrum is proportional to that of the source .",
    "we propose to characterize the statistics of the square visibility and that of the closure phase ( i.e. the bispectrum phase ) by computing their respective covariance matrix .",
    "our objective is twofold : derive the error associated to each observable and investigate the degree of dependency of each observable through their correlation coefficients . in order to do so",
    ", we use the spatially continuous model of photodetection introduced by goodman@xcite@xmath4@xcite where the signal is corrupted by three different types of noise : ( i ) the signal photon noise ; ( ii ) the additive gaussian noise of global variance @xmath41 which arises from the detector and from thermal emission ; ( iii ) the atmospheric noise resulting from the coupling efficiency variations due to the turbulence . to simplify the calculations , we assume that the source is unresolved by a single aperture , such that the low frequency coupling coefficients verify eq .",
    "[ eq_rhoi_simplified ] , and that the source visibility is constant over the range of the interferometric peaks , such that the high frequency coupling coefficients verify eq . [ eq_rhoij_simplified ] .",
    "these assumptions drive to neglect the modal speckle noise regime ",
    "it has been shown that the modal speckle noise is rejected towards negative magnitudes and only affects very bright sources@xcite  and to only focus on  photon noise \" and  detector noise \" regimes .",
    "the full calculations of the covariance coefficients of the visibilities and of the closure phases are done in appendix a. they lead to relatively complicated formulae which depend on the strehl statistics . using a simple analytical approach ,",
    "we derive in appendix bthe mean and the variance of the strehl as a function of the turbulence strength and the level of ao correction .",
    "the relative error of the strehl is bounded between two limit values@xcite@xmath4@xcite : @xmath42 table [ table_error ] .",
    "gives the expressions of the limiting values of the variance of the visibility and the closure phase for a point source in both  photon noise \" and  detector noise \" regimes .",
    "the error of the visibility will be deeply used in the next section to derive the performances of the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) with regards to single sources diameter measurements .",
    "let us concentrate in this part on the correlation coefficients of the visibilities and the closure phases , respectively .",
    "their limiting values are summarized in table [ table_noises ] . clearly , for visibilities the correlation coefficients are null in the photon noise regime when no telescope is in common ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_vis_config ] . ) and are always smaller than @xmath0 otherwise , and for the closure phases they are null when no baseline is in common ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cov_config ] . ) and are always smaller than @xmath1 otherwise .",
    "furthermore , the relative number of null elements in the covariance matrices rapidly increases with the number of telescopes .",
    "it implies that if there are @xmath43 _ linearly independent _ closure phase relations@xcite , the whole set of @xmath44 closure phase relations can be considered in first approximation as _ statistically independent_.    it would be of great interest to pursue this study by comparing the statistics of the closure phase to that of the phase measured by phase referencing technique .",
    "the formalism presented in appendix a can indeed be transposed to the phase referencing case , but it requires a dedicated analysis which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the present generation of interferometers only provides small number of telescopes ( basically @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "in such a case , it is frequent that the lack of spatial frequencies in the @xmath47 coverage prevents from image reconstruction of the studied object .",
    "hence , the measurements have to be analyzed in the light of a model of the object .",
    "we propose here a simple @xmath48 model - fitting of the observables .",
    "let us define @xmath49 as the normalized spectrum of the object model characterized by a set of parameters @xmath50 . from this spectrum",
    "we derive the model of the observables that have to be fitted according to the measurements : +"
