    "the stiffness decreased by 40 % compared to the case of flat faces .    from the foregoing discussion it is clear that more complex , three - dimensional random models are necessary to improve predictions for cellular solids  @xcite .",
    "there are two main problems in studying random models .",
    "first , a sufficiently accurate model of the microstructure must be developed . and",
    "second , the properties of the model must be accurately evaluated .",
    "we emphasize that there are no exact analytical calculations available for general random materials , so that numerical methods become necessary .",
    "in this paper we use a finite element method ( fem )  @xcite to estimate the elastic properties of model cellular solids over a range of densities .",
    "the models are generated using tessellation methods  @xcite and level - cut random field models  @xcite .",

    "the result provides good agreement with data for closed - cell foams when @xmath31  @xcite . in part",

    "there are also several kinds of exact bounds that have been derived for the elastic properties of composite materials  @xcite .",
    "if the properties of each phase in a composite are not too dissimilar , the bounds can be quite restrictive .",
    "for porous materials , however , the bounds on poisson s ratio are no more restrictive than the range guaranteed by the non - negativity of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for isotropic materials ( @xmath34 ) , and the lower bound on @xmath1 reduces to zero .",
    "nevertheless , the upper bound on @xmath1 is sometimes found to provide a reasonable approximation of the actual property .",
    "the most commonly applied bounds for isotropic composites are due to hashin - shtrikman  @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to compare the bound with the formulae reported above .",

    "( [ thyga_c ] ) actually violates the bound if more that half the solid material resides in the cell faces ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the finite element method uses a variational formulation of the linear elastic equations , and finds the solution by minimizing the elastic energy via a fast conjugate gradient method .",
    "the fem we use has been especially adapted for periodic rectangular parallelepiped digital images ( although they can be used on non - periodic images ) .",
    "the algorithm handles only linear elasticity at present , although it is not in principle restricted to only linear elasticity .",
    "each pixel , in 3-d , is taken to be a tri - linear finite element  @xcite . for random materials , it is much easier to mesh using the pixels of the digital image lattice rather than a collection of beams , plates , etc .",
    "the digital image is assumed to have periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a strain is applied , with the average stress or the average elastic energy giving the effective elastic moduli  @xcite .",
    "details of the theory and copies of the actual programs used are reported in the papers of garboczi & day  @xcite and garboczi  @xcite .",
    "given a digital microstructure , the finite element method provides a numerical solution of the elasticity equations .",
    "the accuracy is only limited by the finite number of pixels which can be used ( around @xmath47 in this study ) .",
    "preliminary studies indicated that about 100 cells are necessary to properly simulate the macroscopic properties of a cellular solid ( which may have many thousands of cells ) .",
    "we generally calculated the properties of five samples at each density and report an average value . the statistical uncertainty in the results is estimated to be less than 10 % .",
    "note that if a foam is regular and periodic , just one measurement on a unit cell is sufficient .",
    "a potentially greater source of error occurs in the finite element method when there are insufficient pixels in a solid region to correctly model continuum elasticity .",
    "a useful method of estimating these discretization errors is to compute the properties of regular periodic foams , since in these models there are no sources of statistical error , and there are exact solutions to which to compare the numerical results .",
    "the foams we consider have cubic symmetry , which means that the direction dependent elastic properties can be characterized by three independent constants , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , of the hooke s law stress - strain tensor  @xcite . for loading along the @xmath51-axis ( ie .",

    "we found virtually no difference ( @xmath56 1 % ) in @xmath55 indicating that the discretization errors are quite small .",
    "however , the absolute value is 15 % greater than that estimated by simone and gibson  @xcite using a specially tailored finite - element grid .",
    "since we have found our fem to be accurate for many other test cases , the origin of the discrepancy is unclear . in related studies ,",
    "we have found discretization errors of around 10 % , and we assume this will be true for the random models studied here .",
    "the most common models of cellular solids are generated by voronoi tessellation of distributions of ` seed - points ' in space . around each seed",
    "there is a region of space that is closer to that seed than any other .",
    "this region defines the cell of a voronoi ( or dirichlet ) tessellation  @xcite .",
    "the voronoi tessellation can also be obtained  @xcite by allowing spherical bubbles to grow with uniform velocity from each of the seed points . where two bubbles touch , growth is halted at the contact point , but allowed to continue elsewhere . in this respect",
    "the tessellation is similar to the actual process of liquid foam formation  @xcite .",
    "of course physical constraints , such as minimization of surface energy , will also play an important role . depending on the properties of the liquid and the processing conditions ,",
    "the resultant solid foam will be comprised of open and/or closed cells .",
    "it is worth noting that the tessellation of the bcc array ( the tetrakaidecahedral cell model discussed above ) is a reasonable approximation to the foam introduced by lord kelvin  @xcite .",
    "the cells of the kelvin foam are uniformly shaped , fill space , and satisfy plateau s law of foam equilibrium ( three faces meet at angles of 120@xmath57 , and four struts join at 109.5@xmath57 ) . in order for this to be true , the faces and edges are slightly curved  @xcite , unlike those of the tetrakaidecahedral cell model .    to generate foams with a roughly uniform cell size we use 122 seed points corresponding to the center s of close - packed ( fraction 0.511 ) hard spheres in thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",

    "( [ thyga_c ] ) was found to not be applicable to the models studied here , since the low edge fractions ( @xmath46 ) caused the equation to exceed known upper bounds on the young s modulus .",
    "moreover , attempts to describe the deformation of closed or partially closed cellular materials in terms of a bending ( exponent @xmath13 ) and plate stretching ( exponent @xmath15 ) component were not successful .",
    "instead , our results indicate that these mechanisms combine non - linearly and are best represented by a non - integer power law .",
    "variational upper bounds , and other predictions for random closed cell foams , were found to significantly over - estimate the young s moduli of the models .",
    "therefore numerical simulation must be relied on for accurate predictions .    in this study",
    ", we have shown that it is important to consider large - scale ( multi - cellular ) models of random cellular solids in order to obtain realistic elastic properties . while the modulus of the closed cell voronoi tessellation can be approximately described by a single cell of the tetrakaidecahedral model , it is not possible to model the effect of missing faces and irregular cells with curved walls using single - cell models .",
    "our results are consistent with experimental data , and show a more complex density dependence than predicted by conventional theories based on scaling arguments and periodic cell models .",
    "our results focus on the effect of multi - cellular disorder , rather than local characteristics ( e.g. , distribution of mass between cell edges and walls ) of cellular materials , for the following reasons .",
    "first , it is difficult to simultaneously model the local and global variables with finite computational power , and second , study of single cell models probably provides a more fruitful route to understanding the influence of local cell - character on the overall properties .",
