    "deep x - ray surveys have progressively resolved an increasing fraction of the soft x - ray background ( xrb ) , into faint point - like sources .",
    "most recently , the ultra - deep _ chandra _ surveys ( @xcite , @xcite ) , have resolved over @xmath8 of the 0.52 kev xrb .",
    "source counts have been measured in these fields to limiting fluxes of a few times @xmath9erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 , with corresponding sky densities of over @xmath12 sources deg@xmath13 , @xcite .",
    "optical identification of faint x - ray sources reveals a heterogeneous mixture of objects , with the dominant class being active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these x - ray selected agn have a range of luminosities spanning several orders of magnitude , are found at redshifts up to 5 , and exhibit a wide range of observational properties .",
    "the unification scheme of @xcite attributes the wide variety of radio , optical and x - ray characteristics seen between agn classes , to the geometry and relative orientation of a dusty torus surrounding the central black hole . the dusty torus model is used to to explain both the absence of broadened optical lines , and the strong x - ray absorption seen in many agn .",
    "the simplest version of the unified scheme is one in which the geometry of the inner regions , and hence the distribution of absorbing column densities ( @xmath1 ) , is independent of all other agn properties .",
    "a number of refinements to this model have been suggested , in order to explain recent observations which are at odds with the simple unified scheme .",
    "the demographics of the 0.52 kev agn population have been well measured , albeit to relatively bright flux limits , using _ rosat _ /_einstein",
    "_ samples , for example by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each of these studies indicates strong evolution of the agn x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) , with a peak in agn activity at @xmath14 , although the best description of this evolution is disputed .",
    "the soft xlf is characterised by a double power - law with a knee at @xmath15 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "the bulk of the xrb is the result of the integrated emission of agn having luminosities in the vicinity of this knee .",
    "the spectral slope of the 0.11 kev xrb is @xmath16 @xcite , approximately matching that of a typical soft band detected agn , @xmath17 , ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , at harder x - ray energies the xrb flattens dramatically , and has @xmath18 in the 110 kev band ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and can not be produced by a simple superposition of canonical @xmath19 agn spectra .",
    "clearly , some additional sources of hard x - rays must exist , and a large population of heavily absorbed agn is postulated to fill this role .",
    "population synthesis models have been formulated , such as those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and have been successful in reproducing both the broad band spectrum of the xrb , as well as the agn source counts observed below 10 kev .",
    "@xcite predict that the majority ( @xmath20 ) , of the agn population is heavily absorbed .",
    "a number of deep surveys of the 210 kev sky have been performed with _",
    "chandra _ and xmm-_newton _",
    "( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the 2ms observations of the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - north )",
    ", sources have been detected to a limiting flux of @xmath21 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 in the 210 kev band @xcite .",
    "the 1ms observations of the _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdf - south ) , are estimated to have resolved more than @xmath22 of the 210 kev xrb @xcite . however , due to the relatively large uncertainty ( @xmath23 ) in the total intensity of the 210 kev cosmic xrb , the precise resolved fraction is still somewhat unknown @xcite . it has also been shown that extrapolating the source counts seen in the chandra deep fields to much lower fluxes does not reproduce fully the total level of the cosmic xrb , suggesting the existence of an additional very faint x - ray population ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    the luminosity function of agn that are selected in the 210 kev band , has been measured by several studies .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that strong evolution of the hard xlf has occurred between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 epochs .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 247 agn , including some from the cdf - north , to show that the xlf is best represented by a complex luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model .",
    "it should be noted that this sample does not reach to the limiting flux of the cdf - n data , but to @xmath26 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 , where the optical identifications are reasonably complete .    the major stumbling block in understanding the nature of the faint",
    ", hard x - ray selected agn population , is the difficulty of obtaining optical spectroscopic identifications .",
    "the soft x - ray selected samples used for xlf determinations , for example @xcite and @xcite , are primarily , or wholly , composed of bright ( @xmath27 ) , broad - line agn counterparts , which are relatively easy to optically identify . at fainter x - ray fluxes , such as those probed in the cdf - north , agn without broad lines , together with normal galaxies , make up a large fraction of the identified objects @xcite .",
    "those non - broad - line agn having spectroscopic identifications are almost all found with @xmath28 , in contrast to the peak of the broad - line sample , which lies at @xmath29 .",
    "the large numbers of @xmath30 type - ii quasars ( having log@xmath31 , log@xmath32 ) , predicted by synthesis models have not been detected in these surveys .",
    "the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that the absorbed and unabsorbed agn are taken from separate populations , a direct contradiction of the simplest unified scheme .",
    "however , the optical follow up programs in these deep _ chandra _ fields are by no means complete to the faint x - ray limit . for example , in the cdf - north , only 55% of the x - ray detections have optical counterparts with @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "objects fainter than this limit are practically unidentifiable with current optical spectroscopic techniques .",
    "there is a wide range of x - ray to optical flux ratios , @xmath34 in these samples , and so the unidentifiable objects are not necessarily the faintest x - ray sources , and produce a significant fraction of the xrb .",
    "the nature of these optically faint , hard x - ray objects is still not well understood .",
    "they could be narrow line agn at @xmath35 , with their strongest emission lines shifted out of the optical band .",
    "a number of optically - faint _ chandra _ sources have been identified from their near ir properties to be agn located in luminous , evolved host galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the unidentifiable sources may be agn embedded in optically thick dusty galaxies at moderate redshifts , the faintness of the hosts precluding identification @xcite .",
    "optical studies of nearby seyfert galaxies have found that the ratio , r , of type 2 to type 1 seyferts , is approximately 4 @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray study of these type 2 seyferts by @xcite discovered a wide distribution of absorbing columns , but with @xmath36 of the agn having @xmath37 @xmath7 .",
    "however , this study was limited to the very local universe , @xmath38 mpc , and to low nuclear luminosities , @xmath39 ; the behaviour in the rest of the redshift - luminosity plane is less well understood .",
    "the distribution of absorption in x - ray selected agn is poorly constrained , the prime difficulty being that the greater an object s @xmath1 , the lower is its chance of being detected , or optically identified .",
    "there have been several published cases of agn in which the absorbing columns inferred by optical and x - ray measurements differ significantly ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . despite these limitations ,",
    "the @xmath1 distribution , for hard x - ray selected agn , has been estimated , for relatively bright samples , by @xcite .",
    "these authors have primarily determined @xmath1 in their optically identified sample by examination of x - ray hardness ratio between the 0.52 and 210 kev bands .",
    "the distribution of absorption within the sample is described with a luminosity dependent @xmath1 model , in which high intrinsic luminosity agn are less likely to be heavily absorbed .",
    "this model does require some additional compton thick agn to reproduce fully the xrb when extrapolated to harder energies .",
    "so , despite the progress made in resolving , and to some extent optically identifying , the hard x - ray population , it has still not been possible to delimit the distribution of absorption in agn .",
    "this problem is particularly acute for the heavily absorbed , high-@xmath40 agn ; few of which have been detected and identified .",
    "however , by better constraining the @xmath41 in faint agn , we can hope to answer many questions about the geometry , composition and evolution of the dusty torus .",
    "for example , the strength of the luminosity dependence of @xmath41 can tell us about how the radiation from the accretion disk influences the surrounding torus , and/or how the torus geometry scales with black hole mass .",
    "if some redshift evolution of @xmath41 is detected , is it related to the overall evolution of the agn luminosity function ?",
    "does the dusty torus form coevally with the black hole , and is the amount of absorbing material related to the black hole mass ?    in this study we use x - ray hardness ratios as an indicator of absorption in the spectra of the sources in our sample .",
    "many authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) have shown that colour based analyses are effective in deriving the properties of xmm-_newton _ sources which are detected with too few counts to permit full spectral fitting . in these optically identified samples , the agn with and without broad emission lines",
    "are seen to occupy separate regions in x - ray colour - colour plots .",
    "we present in this paper an analysis of the x - ray properties of sources detected by xmm-_newton _ in the @xmath0deep field . in section [ section_observations ]",
    "we describe the xmm-_newton _ observations . in order to escape the possible biases introduced by the incompleteness of optical identification programmes ,",
    "we have devised a method to probe the @xmath41 of our sample .",
    "our technique does not depend on optical identification of the sample , permitting the inclusion of the optically faint x - ray detections .",
    "the simulations use a model xlf to describe the intrinsic distribution of all agn in redshift and ( de - absorbed ) luminosity space ; this is coupled to a model @xmath1 function , to generate a synthetic agn population ( described in section [ section_simulation_method ] ) .",
    "we simulate how this model population would be seen with xmm-_newton _ , accounting for both the selection function caused by the complex epic detector imaging characteristics , and the nuances of the source detection process ( see section [ section_capabilities ] ) .",
    "the output products of the simulation allow direct comparison of each of the model @xmath1 distributions with the @xmath0sample .",
    "we then compare the predictions of several simple unified scheme models of the @xmath1 distribution , by using a statistical comparison of the x - ray colour distributions found in the data and models ( section [ section_colour_stats ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we test two examples of more complex @xmath1 distribution models taken from the literature , and compare them to the @xmath0sample . in section [ section_source_counts ]",
    "we compare the source counts found in the @xmath0field and those predicted by the model simulations .",
    "finally , in section [ section_discussion ] we discuss our results and their implications for agn torus models , and for the evolving xlf model of @xcite .    throughout the paper",
    "we use a lambda - dominated flat cosmology with @xmath42 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 refers to an object s de - absorbed x - ray luminosity in the observed @xmath45 band .",
    "@xmath1 is the equivalent hydrogen column density in units of @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to the @xmath1 distribution function as @xmath41 , and define it to be the fraction of all agn , per unit log@xmath1 , which have absorbing column @xmath1 .",
    "we define a power - law spectrum to be @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the flux in units of photons kev@xmath10",
    "s@xmath10 @xmath7 , @xmath48 is the photon energy in kev , and @xmath49 is the photon index .",
    "the unified model attributes the x - ray absorption seen in agn to a dusty torus surrounding the central super massive black hole @xcite . for certain orientations ,",
    "the torus obscures the observer s line of sight to the x - ray / uv emitting accretion disk .",
    "there have been a wide range of absorbing columns inferred from the x - ray spectra of various agn , ranging from effectively zero absorption , to column densities over @xmath50@xmath7 .",
    "the unified scheme states that all agn are intrinsically similar , and that the observational differences between the various agn types are due to the orientation of the observer .",
    "therefore , it is the geometry of the dust torus which determines the amount of obscuring material along the observer s line of sight to the central x - ray emitting regions .",
    "if we assume that all agn have the same geometry , then it is only the properties of the torus which determine the observed @xmath41 in the agn population as a whole .",
    "a typical zeroth order approach is to speculate that this characteristic geometry is independent of the luminosity of the central engine , and has not evolved over cosmological timescales .",
    "however , alternative scenarios are postulated , for example by @xcite and @xcite , which imply more complex forms for @xmath41 .",
    "the @xcite model suggests that some evolution of the average torus properties has occurred over cosmological timescales , with more absorbed agn at high redshifts .",
    "the @xcite model predicts that the geometry , specifically the opening angle , of the obscuring torus is determined by the luminosity of the central engine .    in this study",
    ", we compare the predictions of several different forms of @xmath41 .",
    "a very simple description of @xmath41 , is a continuous distribution , in which the number of agn per unit log@xmath1 is proportional to @xmath51log@xmath52 , over the range @xmath53  log  @xmath54 .",
    "a similar parameterisation was adopted in the synthesis model of @xcite , who found that setting @xmath55 or @xmath56 gave acceptable fits to the xrb ( it should be noted that the authors used a separately evolving luminosity function for absorbed agn ) .",
    "we have tested three such @xmath41 , and refer to them as the @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 models .",
    "model a of @xcite combines the @xmath41 observed in the optically selected seyfert-2 galaxies @xcite , with a fixed ratio , @xmath60 , of absorbed to unabsorbed agn .",
    "we have tested two similar @xmath41 models here , where @xmath60 is constant and set to 4 , and 8 , and refer to these as the @xmath61 , and @xmath62 models respectively .",
    "the measured distribution of @xcite contains a number of agn where only the lower or upper limit on absorption is known .",
    "so , for the purposes of our study , all those absorbed agn having log@xmath63 are evenly distributed in the @xmath64 log@xmath63 interval , and those with log@xmath65 are set to have log@xmath66 .",
    "we also compare the predictions of model b of @xcite , which is similar to model a , above , but with @xmath61 at @xmath67 increasing to @xmath68 for @xmath69 ; we refer to this as the @xmath70 model .    in addition",
    ", we test the luminosity dependent @xmath41 function of @xcite , in which high luminosity agn are more likely to have lower absorbing columns .",
    "we have converted from our observed frame @xmath71 to rest - frame @xmath72 using the specific spectral slope , and redshift of each simulated agn ; we refer to this as the @xmath73 model .",
    "the @xmath73 model distribution does not include any agn having absorbing columns outside @xmath74 log@xmath75 .",
    "finally , we employ a zero absorption scenario to provide a base - line to the more realistic models ; we call this the @xmath76 model",
    ". a subset of the model @xmath41 are shown in fig .",
    "[ nh_histo ] .    to reiterate , for all the tested models , we take only the @xmath41 part from the published model , and",
    "always use the ldde1 model xlf of @xcite to describe both absorbed and unabsorbed agn .",
    "recent x - ray spectral fitting analyses have found that after absorption is considered , the mean agn photon index @xmath49 is @xmath77 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the absorbed and unabsorbed agn show similar mean slopes , and there is no significant evolution seen even up to @xmath78 . however , there is still an intrinsic scatter of slopes about the mean , and this will have some effect on the observed colours and/or detectability of sources . therefore",
    ", we have used a gaussian distribution of slopes @xmath79 , to represent the spectra of the simulated agn , with @xmath17 , and @xmath80 .",
    "we have not considered sources with slopes outside the range @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite found no apparent dependence of de - absorbed @xmath49 on @xmath40 , @xmath1 , or flux , therefore we assume that @xmath79 is independent of the other agn spectral parameters .",
    "are shown in the leftmost bin , and those with log @xmath65 in the rightmost bin.,width=302 ]",
    "the xmm-_newton _ data consist of three observations of the @xmath0field totalling 200 ks , of which @xmath82ks is unaffected by soft proton flaring . this field was the location of one of the deepest _ rosat _ surveys @xcite , due to its unusually low galactic absorbing column ( @xmath83@xmath7 ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0field has been the subject of a host of multi - wavelength observations , including a mosaic of four 30ks _ chandra _ pointings covering the xmm-_newton _ field of view @xcite , and extensive , very deep radio mapping with the vla @xcite .",
    "the data from the european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) were reduced with version 6.0 of the science analysis software ( sas ) task - set to produce images in four energy bands ( 0.20.5 , 0.52 , 25 , and 510 kev ) .",
    "our source detection process uses the standard sas tasks eboxdetect and emldetect together with a custom background fitting task .",
    "we perform the source detection routines on the combined data from all three ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) epic detectors .",
    "we used simulations to determine detection likelihood limits such that we expect only 3% of the final sourcelist to be spurious detections . using these likelihood limits we detected 225 sources .",
    "the approximate limiting fluxes ( in units of @xmath84 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 ) , are 0.5 ( 0.20.5 kev ) , 0.5 ( 0.52 kev ) , 1.2 ( 25 kev ) , and 5 ( 510 kev ) . in the 25 kev band",
    "our sample reaches a factor @xmath85 fainter than the knee of the source counts , where the contribution to the xrb , per unit log flux , is greatest .",
    "a full description of the data reduction , source searching , and detection threshold determination processes is given in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to test the predictions of a number of model agn populations against agn in the @xmath0field .",
    "however , we do expect to find a small number of non - agn sources in the full x - ray sample , and these could affect our comparisons .",
    "our ongoing optical spectroscopic follow - up program has identified counterparts to over 100 of the xmm-_newton _ sources . in particular ,",
    "the brightest @xmath86 optical counterparts are @xmath87 identified .",
    "four of the sources , including the brightest source in the field , are associated with foreground stars , and therefore are not included in this study .",
    "we do not expect many of the remaining optically faint , @xmath88 , counterparts to be identified with stars .",
    "emldetect finds four x - ray sources with high likelihood of being extended , and with fwhm  @xmath89 .",
    "of these four sources , three were identified as clusters by @xcite in an analysis of the _ rosat _ imaging of the @xmath0field .",
    "@xcite found two additional clusters in the @xmath0field , however , these are both located at the very edge of the epic field of view , ( where the vignetting is most pronounced ) , and are not detected as extended sources by emldetect .",
    "our agn population models do not include clusters of galaxies , so we discount the four extended sources from our analysis .",
    "a small number of fainter clusters are expected to remain in the sample , but not be flagged as extended by emldetect .",
    "we estimate this number by extrapolating the @xmath90 plot of @xcite to lower fluxes , whilst incorporating the effective area determination of our survey @xcite . assuming that the flux limit for detecting extended sources is twice that for point sources , and using a @xmath90 slope of @xmath91 , we predict that approximately five additional clusters will remain in the sample .",
    "after the stars and obvious clusters are removed , the resulting xmm-_newton _ sample contains a total of 217 sources of which the vast majority are likely to be agn .",
    "we have devised a monte carlo simulation technique which allows direct comparison of the pattern of x - ray colours produced by agn absorption models , with the pattern seen in the @xmath0sample . for this , we have extended the xmm-_newton _ imaging simulation method of @xcite , to a multi - band approach .",
    "we model the epic point spread function , vignetting and diffuse background in the same way as before .",
    "this method accounts for observational biases and the complex selection function at work in the sample .",
    "each iteration of the simulation method consists of four steps .",
    "i ) we generate an input source population , with each member having a set of randomly distributed parameters @xmath92 and @xmath49 , from the xlf , @xmath41 , and @xmath79 models .",
    "ii ) multi - band count rates are calculated for each simulated source according to , @xmath93 , and the chosen spectral model .",
    "iii ) random source positions are assigned , and the sourcelist is folded through a model of the epic imaging response to create multi - band images for each epic detector .",
    "iv ) a source - detection chain is carried out on the resulting multi - band images to create an output sourcelist .",
    "we repeat these steps for 100 simulated fields for each @xmath41 model , and for two agn spectral models .",
    "simulated images are produced separately for the mos1 , mos2 and pn cameras , then combined to produce a single image in each of the four energy bands for source searching purposes .      to generate the catalogue for the @xmath0field , @xcite used model @xmath94 curves to represent the agn population independently in each of four energy bands . while valid for monochromatic studies , this technique is not suitable for colour analyses , since it takes no account of the multi - band properties of individual sources .",
    "we assume that there exists a single _ intrinsic _ xlf which describes all agn , which is modified by some distribution of absorption to produce the observed xrb , source counts and source colours .    of the various models for the soft xlf ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we have chosen to use the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde1 ) xlf model of @xcite .",
    "this was primarily because it is based on a large sample of agn , and its model parameters have been determined for the currently preferred lambda - dominated cosmology .",
    "the sample used to fit this xlf model contains a mixture of agn both with , and without , broad lines , suggesting that it contains a subset of absorbed agn .",
    "we adopt the best fitting parameter values presented in table 3 of @xcite , and where appropriate , have corrected for the @xmath42 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 used in this study .",
    "we integrate the xlf over the range @xmath95 log@xmath96 , @xmath97 to calculate the total number of agn expected in the field .",
    "a 1d cumulative probability distribution is generated by integrating the 2d xlf via an arbitrary path in @xmath40 , @xmath71 space .",
    "it is then possible to build a list of agn which are randomly distributed in @xmath40 , @xmath71 according to the model xlf .",
    "each of these agn are assigned a random value of @xmath1 according to the @xmath41 model being tested , and a spectral slope taken from @xmath79 .",
    "the absolute normalisation of the xlf is iteratively adjusted , so that the simulated fields contain the same source counts as the @xmath0sample at @xmath98 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "we determine the x - ray colours of the simulated agn by using a simple absorbed power - law ( apl ) model , which also includes a correction for the small galactic absorbing column ( @xmath99@xmath7 ) found in the @xmath0field . in order to compare simulated images with the observations",
    ", we must convert from the simulated agn parameters to multi - band epic count rates .",
    "we use the spectral fitting package xspec to generate fake spectra , incorporating both the instrumental response ( for the mos1 , mos2 and pn cameras ) , and the agn parameters @xmath40 , @xmath1 and @xmath49 .",
    "these spectra are summed over the appropriate energy bands , to derive the relevant conversion factors .",
    "the cost in processing time would be prohibitive if we were to individually recalculate these conversion factors for each of the thousands of simulated agn .",
    "hence , we have built lookup tables of conversion ratios , which finely sample @xmath100 parameter space , covering the range @xmath101 , @xmath102 log@xmath103 , @xmath81 .",
    "the conversion ratios are calculated for a single luminosity , but then scaled according to the luminosity of each simulated agn .",
    "these tables are used to convert rapidly from any set of simulated agn parameters @xmath93 to count rates , for each epic detector , and energy band .",
    "we have also examined the effect of including a small reflection component in the spectral model .",
    "this has the net effect of hardening the spectrum at higher energies , making simulated agn slightly more detectable above 5  kev .",
    "we use the pexrav model of @xcite , with the reflecting material covering @xmath104 steradians , a viewing angle of @xmath105 , and solar abundances .",
    "we call this the apl+r spectral model .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this study to include more complex agn spectral features , such as @xmath106 lines , or scattered soft x - ray emission .",
    "we expect the effect of these features on agn colours to be small relative to the effects of continuum obscuration .",
    "however , some of our results suggest that a number of detected sources in the @xmath0field have an additional soft component , as discussed later .",
    "we expect to be able to detect very few ( if any ) very heavily absorbed agn having log@xmath65 , and so have not included such objects in the simulated populations .",
    "in fact , the simulations show us that we expect agn having log@xmath107 to account for only @xmath108 of the detections in the @xmath0sample .",
    "therefore , any additional attenuation due to compton scattering within the dusty torus is ignored , since it has little effect for agn with log@xmath75 .",
    "the simulation method incorporates the effects of the epic response function , effective area , point spread function ( psf ) , vignetting , and background to produce multi - band images .",
    "we use the energy and off - axis angle dependent `` medium '' accuracy psf model , taken from the xmm-_newton _ calibration library .",
    "this psf model has been measured to be accurate to better than @xmath109 at @xmath110kev @xcite . the effective exposure time and vignetting",
    "are calculated from the sas generated exposure maps for the @xmath0field .",
    "a synthetic background is added to the simulated images to reproduce the level observed in the observations . the correct level of this additional background was determined through an iterative process to account for the contribution from the faint unresolved simulated sources .",
    "we use the simultaneous , multi - band source detection process on the combined simulated mos1+mos2+pn images in the same fashion as described for the @xmath0data @xcite .",
    "however , only one iteration of the background determination process is carried out , in order to conserve computation time .",
    "we have searched for sources over the entire useful field of view of the combined epic detectors , giving a total sky area of 0.185 deg@xmath111 .",
    "the inherent capabilities and limitations of the @xmath0survey data can be precisely evaluated using our simulation method . in this section",
    "we refer to sources found in the simulated images by emldetect as `` output '' sources .",
    "we have employed a simple algorithm , that for each output source , associates an input source , in order that the colours of the output sources can be related to the input parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath112 , @xmath1 , and @xmath49 ) . for the majority of output sources , there is a single nearby input candidate , which we consider to be the progenitor . however , in some cases , an output source can have several nearby input candidate sources .",
    "this problem is exacerbated at high off - axis angles because of the degradation of the psf ( and consequently , the precision of positions reported by emldetect ) .",
    "therefore , we have employed a simple algorithm that matches each output source to the brightest input source within a small radius , @xmath113 of the detected position .",

    "[ colour_nh_ranges ] shows , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are sensitive to the shape of the distribution over a wide range of @xmath1 , particularly for intermediately absorbed sources .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath188 is strongly favoured over the @xmath61 @xmath41 model ( see table [ ks_results ] ) .",
    "these two models are very similar in the range @xmath191  log@xmath75 , contain similar numbers of unabsorbed agn ( log @xmath162 ) , and produce comparable numbers of `` hard '' sources .",
    "therefore , the difference must lie primarily in the @xmath64  log@xmath63 range , in which the @xmath188 model contains many more agn .",
    "a major problem with the uniformly dense torus model is that it predicts that nearly all agn will be either heavily absorbed or completely unabsorbed .",
    "however , more complex models , incorporating a wide distribution of torus densities , predict larger numbers of intermediately absorbed agn . for example , a model in which the density falls off exponentially with angle away from the plane of the torus , predicts a much flatter @xmath41 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible , with some tuning of such a model s parameters , to approximately match the best fitting @xmath188 distribution .",
    "since absorption in the @xmath64  log@xmath63 range has only a significant effect on @xmath141 , it would not have been detectable in the colour distributions if the @xmath192 kev band had not been considered .",
    "a number of studies of absorption in faint agn have based their estimates of @xmath1 on hardness ratios between the @xmath193 and @xmath194 kev bands , and therefore may have underestimated the number of intermediately absorbed agn ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "a better determination of mean torus properties will be possible when the @xmath0field is covered by _ spitzer _ , and we are able to correlate x - ray colours with mid / far - ir data .",
    "each of the simulated @xmath41 models produced similar 0.52.0 kev source count - flux relations , @xmath90 .",

    "in fact , at @xmath160 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11the models under - produce the source counts seen in the @xmath0sample by a factor of about two .",
    "this disparity is seen to a similar degree in each of the @xmath41 models , suggesting that it is related to the difference between the data and xlf / evolution model .",

    "[ source_counts_soft ] , plotted assuming our field has a uniform sky area of 0.185 deg@xmath111 .",
    "this illustrates that in the flux range @xmath196 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 , the ldde1 xlf also under - produces the source counts of the sample from which it was derived .",
    "the shape of the @xmath90 relation of the @xcite sample is closer to that seen in the @xmath0sample than to the models .",
    "the faintest agn in the @xcite sample are from the deepest _ rosat _ observations of the lockman hole field , where the flux limit of the data was @xmath197 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "our significantly deeper flux limit means that we are using part of @xmath198 space outside that constrained by the sample of @xcite .",
    "a previous comparison of source counts from _ rosat _ observations in the lockman hole and @xmath0fields , revealed a @xmath199 over - abundance near @xmath200 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 in the @xmath0field with respect to the lockman hole @xcite . in addition",
    ", @xcite found that the @xmath0field is slightly over - dense in the 0.52 kev band with respect to both of the chandra deep fields .",
    "therefore we conclude that the differences between model and sample are caused by a combination of these factors .",
    "in particular , our extrapolation of the ldde1 xlf / evolution model to faint fluxes , suggests that this complex scheme requires some revision .",
    "the shape of the xlf at high redshift is poorly known because of the difficulties in obtaining a large spectroscopically identified sample of these objects .",
    "we can use the simulated source population to make predictions about the number of high-@xmath40 agn in the @xmath0sample .",
    "each of the @xmath41 models predict that around 16% of the total number of x - ray detections are due to agn with @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , it can be inferred that the fraction of agn with @xmath3 in the x - ray population is primarily dependent on the shape of the underlying xlf and its evolution , rather than the @xmath1 distribution within the high-@xmath40 population .",
    "the model predictions suggest that we should expect around 35 high-@xmath40 agn in the @xmath0field . however , only a single agn has been identified having @xmath3 by our follow up optical spectroscopy program ( which has secure ids for over 100 sources ) .",
    "this disparity is maybe due to the over - production of faint sources by the xlf / evolution model ; these are more likely to be at high @xmath40 .",
    "the x - ray detection probability of the @xmath3 agn is much less dependent on @xmath1 than for the low-@xmath40 agn , since most absorption is redshifted below 2 kev .",
    "therefore , most of the @xmath41 models predict that absorbed agn make up the majority of the _ detected _ high-@xmath40 population , the precise fraction being dependent on the particular @xmath41 model",
    ". however , the absorption of optical and uv spectral features does severely affect the probability of identification for these objects .",
    "we have recently obtained further deep optical imaging of the @xmath0field in several bands , which will permit us to make photometric redshift estimates for some of the optically faint sources .",
    "the forthcoming deep coverage of the @xmath0field in the infrared with _ spitzer _ will further constrain the nature of the high-@xmath40 population .",
    "we have demonstrated how a colour - based analysis of deep xmm-_newton _ data can be used to constrain models of absorption in the agn population without requiring complete optical spectroscopic follow up . by using a detailed simulation technique , we have been able to take account of the complex selection function at work in the sample , and demonstrate how this modulates the input population .",
    "we have shown that a simple @xmath41 model together with an absorbed power - law spectral model ( including a reflection component ) , reproduces the observed @xmath141/@xmath142/@xmath143 colour distribution with probability 6% . all of the other model @xmath1 distributions that we compared were rejected at greater than 99.5% probablity .",
    "in particular , two more complex @xmath41 models are strongly rejected by the 3d - ks test ; the redshift dependent @xmath70 model produces too many hard sources , and the luminosity dependent @xmath171 model produces too few . in general , the addition of a reflection component to the absorbed power - law spectral model improved the match between the colour distributions of the models and the sample .",
    "the reflection component serves to harden the spectral slope at higher energies , and its effect was most evident in the @xmath142 and @xmath143 distributions .",
    "we have shown that there is a large disparity between the shape of the @xmath90 produced by the models and that found in our sample .",
    "we suggest that this is for the most part due to differences between the actual @xmath198 distribution of sources in the @xmath0field , and the xlf / evolution model that we have used .",
    "these xlf / evolution differences will have had some effect on the colour distributions produced by the @xmath41 models , and could explain the surfeit of @xmath202 sources produced by all of the @xmath41 models .",
    "we have seen some evidence that suggests that the spectra of a significant fraction of absorbed sources in the @xmath0sample have an additional soft x - ray component .",
    "this feature was not included in our spectral models , and therefore contributed a large part of the disparity between the @xmath141 distributions of models and sample . considering this factor , together with the xlf / evolution differences , we conclude that the 6% probability for the @xmath59 model shows that it provides a rather good fit to the data .",
    "the shape of the @xmath188 distribution can be broadly reproduced using a toy model for the torus in which the density falls away rapidly for viewing angles away from the plane of the torus .",
    "we have shown that agn having log@xmath32 can be efficiently selected by choosing sources in the regions @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the x - ray properties of sources detected in the @xmath0xmm-_newton _ deep ( 200ks ) field . in order to constrain the absorbed agn population , </S>",
    "<S> we use extensive monte carlo simulations to directly compare the x - ray colours of observed sources with those predicted by several model distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have carried out our comparisons over the entire 0.210 kev energy range of the xmm-_newton _ cameras , making our analysis sensitive to a large range of absorbing column densities . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the simplest form of the unified scheme , whereby the intrinsic luminosity function of absorbed agn is set to be the same as that of their unabsorbed brethren , coupled with various model distributions of absorption . </S>",
    "<S> of the tested distributions , the best fitting model has the fraction of agn with absorbing column @xmath1 , proportional to ( log@xmath1)@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also tested two extensions to the unified scheme : an evolving absorption scenario , in which the fraction of absorbed sources is larger at higher redshifts , and a luminosity dependent model in which high luminosity agn are less likely to be absorbed . </S>",
    "<S> both of these models provide poorer matches to the observed x - ray colour distributions than the best fitting simple unified model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a luminosity dependent density evolution luminosity function reproduces poorly the 0.52 kev source counts seen in the @xmath0field . </S>",
    "<S> field to field variations could be the cause of this disparity . </S>",
    "<S> computing the x - ray colours with a simple absorbed power - law spectral model is found to over - predict , by a factor of two , the fraction of hard sources that are completely absorbed below 0.5 kev , implying that an additional source of soft - band flux must be present in a number of the absorbed sources . </S>",
    "<S> the tested synthesis models predict that around 16% of the detections in the @xmath0field are due to agn at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far , only a single agn with @xmath4 has been identified in our approximately @xmath5 complete optical spectroscopy follow up program . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use our simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of a hardness ratio selection scheme at selecting absorbed sources for further study . using this selection scheme , </S>",
    "<S> we show that around 40% of the @xmath0sample are expected to be agn with @xmath6 @xmath7 .    </S>",
