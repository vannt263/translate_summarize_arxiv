    "the recent discovery in  of a new antiferromagnetic phase , which restores tetragonal symmetry at temperatures below the transition to the more commonly observed orthorhombic antiferromagnetism , has important implications for the nature of unconventional superconductivity in the iron pnictides.@xcite in these systems , the structural and magnetic phase transitions are strongly coupled , and two major schools of thought have emerged favoring either magnetic fluctuations ( ref  ) or orbital ordering ( ref  ) as the primary driving force . discriminating between these two models",
    "is complicated by the fact that magnetoelastic coupling ensures that the onset of one order parameter triggers the other,@xcite and indeed the structural and magnetic phase transitions are coincident and first - order in many of the iron pnictides.@xcite however , a resolution of this issue will provide strong constraints on the origin and symmetry of the superconducting order parameter.@xcite    magnetic order in  and related 122  structures consists of antiferromagnetic stripes , in which iron spins within each plane are ferromagnetically aligned along one iron - iron bond direction and antiferromagnetically aligned along the orthogonal bond .",
    "the magnetic moments are aligned within the plane parallel to the antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "this magnetic structure breaks the four - fold symmetry of the iron atom square lattice and is accompanied by a reduction in the symmetry of the atomic lattice from tetragonal to orthorhombic , _",
    "i.e. _ , from the m  to _ fmmm _ space groups . in the following ,",
    "we refer to this as the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the transition to the new magnetic phase , which restores four - fold m  symmetry to the atomic lattice and so is referred to as the @xmath0 phase , occurs at temperatures ( @xmath9 ) below the @xmath2 transition .",
    "the magnetic bragg peaks have the same reciprocal space indices in both the @xmath2 and @xmath0 phases,@xcite although the spins in the @xmath0 phase are oriented parallel to the @xmath10 axis.@xcite one way to achieve this is for the magnetic order to consist of a double-*q * structure , comprising the superposition of stripes along both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions within the same domain .",
    "it is , also , possible to construct models of orbital order that are consistent with a tetragonal space group , but they are incompatible with double-*q * magnetic order.@xcite    recently , mssbauer data combined with high - resolution neutron and x - ray diffraction on a new compound , sr~@xmath13~na~@xmath14~fe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ , has conclusively demonstrated that the @xmath0 magnetic structure is a double-*q * spin - density wave ( sdw).@xcite this sample , which is a member of the series that forms the subject of this paper , exhibits a transition from the paramagnetic tetragonal phase to the @xmath2 phase at @xmath15 105  k and then a strongly first - order transition to the @xmath0 phase at about 65  k. the mssbauer data unequivocally demonstrates that , in the @xmath0 phase , 50% of the iron sites are non - magnetic and 50% have double the moment measured in the @xmath2 phase .",
    "this is confirmation that the @xmath0 phase arises from the constructive and destructive interference of two orthogonal sdws .",
    "more details can be found elsewhere.@xcite    the observed double-*q * structure requires the transfer of magnetization density from non - magnetic to magnetic sites .",
    "this is inconsistent with localized models of magnetic moments with fixed amplitudes on each site .",
    "it is , however , consistent with more weakly coupled models , in which a modulation of the itinerant electron spin density is caused by quasi - nesting features of the fermi surface . in this scenario ,",
    "interband interactions between the hole pockets at the zone center and the electron pockets at the zone boundary generate strong magnetic fluctuations along both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 axes . in the @xmath2 phase",
    ", there is a breaking of ising symmetry by nesting along one or other directions , whereas in the @xmath0 phase , there is a simultaneous nesting along both directions , restoring four - fold symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 phase is predicted to be stabilized by an increasing mismatch in the size of the hole and electron pockets.@xcite the spin reorientation follows from symmetry considerations in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    the @xmath0 transition is higher in  than in the other compounds , in which it has been observed .",
    "this indicates that the tetragonal phase is more stable in this series , so we mapped out the entire phase diagram in this work .",
    "we report the synthesis of high quality  samples with @xmath11 up to a nominal composition of 0.6 .",
    "samples beyond the @xmath16 composition are not investigated here because they are beyond the region of @xmath0 stability and are expected to show purely superconducting transitions with reduced @xmath17 s down to @xmath18 k for the metastable  compound.@xcite the compositional range chosen for this study allows us to fully focus on the region of phase coexistence and phase competition among diverse ground states .",
    "universality of the @xmath0 phase in the hole - doped pnictides is fully established by this study with  being the third known series to show the existence of this novel magnetic phase after  and .@xcite we will delineate the relatively large region of the @xmath0 phase with @xmath9 s peaking at @xmath19 k. the relative stability of the samples in air coupled with the @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and sc phase competition will undoubtedly provide strong clues for solving the unconventional nature of superconductivity in the pnictide superconductors .",

    "@xcite while the magnetic transition in the iron selenides is not strongly coupled to a structural transition , the strong magneto - elastic coupling in the hole - doped 122 iron arsenides , where magnetism is the primary order parameter , suggests it is likely that the smaller lattice of the sr system allows for larger magnetic interactions between neighboring iron sites and so enhances the behavior of the structural and magnetic phase transitions .",

    "this reorientation can be observed in all samples @xmath59 as shown in panels a - d and f - i of fig  [ fig:6 ] which together with the results discussed in section  [ subsec : tstruct ] indicates a robust @xmath0 dome extending over @xmath60 in composition space , considerably larger than that observed in either of the other hole - doped systems with @xmath61 being @xmath62 and @xmath63 for  and  respectively.@xcite    fig  [ fig:8 ] shows representative best - fit rietveld plots for the @xmath50 and @xmath64 samples obtained from structural refinements performed on patterns collected at 10 k - one sample each from the strictly orthorhombic and re - entrant tetragonal regions described in section  [ subsec : tstruct ] . while the two samples have different structures at this temperature , both exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with significant intensities at the  and  magnetic peaks and therefore , allow for fitting to different magnetic models . while the presence of only two or three magnetic peaks makes it practically impossible to converge to a unique magnetic structural model relying solely on neutron powder diffraction , in previous work we proposed two possible models capable of producing satisfactory fits to the tetragonal @xmath0 phase in ba~@xmath65~na~@xmath66~fe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ with both models favoring a spin reorientation from the _ ab _ plane to the out - of - plane direction , a prediction which has since been confirmed .",
    "the lower panel of fig  [ fig:8 ] shows the fit of a tetragonal magnetic model with magnetic moments along the _ c _ axis and @xmath67 magnetic space group symmetry to the @xmath20 0.34 sample in the @xmath0 region.@xcite this model which forms from the superposition of two magnetic ordering vectors ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) fits the data well , correctly accounting for the redistribution of magnetic intensity .",
    "as described in a recent group theoretical analysis work , we determined that the double-*q * model necessitates that half the fe sites become nonmagnetic ( nodes ) while the remaining half allow the tetragonal sdw antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "@xcite in later work waer,_et al_. used polarized neutron diffraction on a  single crystal exhibiting the @xmath0 phase and found that the magnetic reorientation finds the magnetic moments pointing along the _ c _ axis . very recently , we were able to rule in favor of the double q model using a combination of mssbauer spectroscopy , neutron and synchrotron powder diffraction.@xcite it is clear that the two afm phases , hosted on different structures and happening at different temperatures , are both competing with superconductivity .",
    "interestingly , though the @xmath2 afm phase is supressed at the onset of superconductivity the magnetic @xmath0 phase in this material clearly supresses superconductivity .",
    "@xcite this strong interaction between the double-*q * afm phase and superconductivity is manifest in the nearly flat and low @xmath17 values of @xmath70 k which are only allowed to rise as a function of increasing na content after leaving the relatively wide @xmath0 dome .",
    "we speculate that the @xmath0 phase might impact the pairing mechanism of the cooper pairs in the sc phase .",
    "recent theoretical work and capacitance dilatometry measurements performed on  have suggested the presence of an incommensurate magnetic structure either at the edge of the @xmath2 dome or in the intermediate temperatures @xmath71 for samples exhibiting @xmath0 re - entrance.@xcite in the analysis presented here no such incommensurate magnetic ordering has been observed .",
    "modeling of the magnetic structure has been performed using high resolution neutron diffraction data collected on powgen in each of these regions ( see fig  [ fig:8 ] for example ) .",
    "samples with composition @xmath72 were well fit by the established @xmath73 magnetic space group at temperatures @xmath74 with no divergence from the expected peak positions.@xcite a similar analysis performed on the @xmath75 sample which only shows @xmath2 magnetic structure ( see figure  [ fig:6]@xmath76 ) , also exhibited no observable departure from the known magnetic structure .",
    "therefore , if any incommensurate magnetic ordering in either of these regions is present it must be approximate to the @xmath73 to within the resolution of our studies .",
    "( color online ) rietveld fits of orthorhombic and tetragonal magnetic models to @xmath20 0.29 and 0.34 samples .",
    "data collected at 10k on powgen . indicated by arrows are the  and  magnetic peaks ( as indexed in the m  structure ) . ]          in the tetragonal m  symmetry seen in the  materials there are six as - fe - as angles in the fe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ layers . due to the symmetry of the structure , these",
    "six can be reduced to two related angles defined as @xmath77 and @xmath78 . at the structural transition",
    "the lowered orthorhombic symmetry causes the @xmath78 angle to split into two separate angles denoted as @xmath79 and @xmath80 as shown in figure  [ fig:9]@xmath81 .",
    "previously ( ref  ) , we have discussed the competing effects of the na^+^ ion s smaller ionic radius and reduced electron contribution , when compared to ba , on bonding in the fe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ layers and the spirit of these considerations remains unchanged in application to the sr material .",
    "the raised oxidation state of fe causes a contraction along the fe - fe bonds ( as directly observed by the contraction of the _ a _ axis ) which , coupled with the rigidity of the fe - as bond , causes an expansion of the cell along the _ c _ direction .    the fe - as bond rigidity is clearly seen in fig  [ fig:9]_k _ where the bond length is essentially constant between @xmath82 at room temperature .",
    "this rigidity is also maintained even as a function of temperature as seen in plots e - h where the the fe - as bond changes by no more than 0.2% over a temperature range of over 170 k ( see table  [ table:2 ] for bond lengths and angles at 300 and 10k ) .",
    "this rather robust rigidity dictates that the previously discussed changes in the lattice and contraction of the fe - fe bond must be compensated almost exclusively by the as - fe - as bond angles and the bonding between the alternating fe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ and sr layers .",
    "plotted in fig  [ fig:9]k is the sr - as bond length which , unlike the fe - as bond , shows a doping dependence similar to that of the lattice .",
    "while the @xmath77 angle closes with doping ( as the _ a _ axis contracts ) the rigidity of the fe - as bond causes the as atom to be pushed closer to the sr layer .",
    "a compression of the sr - as bond compensates for part of this change while still requiring an expansion along the _ c _ direction as the fe - as bond becomes more co - linear with the tetragonal axis .",
    "notably , though the sr - as bond length exhibits significant doping dependence , its average value shows little temperature dependence as seen in panels e - h . however , at the orthorhombic and re - entrant tetragonal transitions the sr - as bond splits and reunifies similarly to the _ a _ and _ b _ lattice parameters , and in the orthorhombic structure there is a significant divergence of the bond lengths saturating at a @xmath62   difference at 10k for the 29% sample . with little temperature dependence in either the fe - as or averaged sr - as bonds the majority of the change in the lattice parameters must be due to the changing of the tetrahedral as - fe - as bond angles .",
    "figure  [ fig:9]a - d show the as - fe - as bond angles as a function of temperature for compositions @xmath83 and @xmath84 . as described above , @xmath78 breaks into two separate angles at the orthorhombic transition as is clearly seen for the @xmath20 0.29 sample .",
    "this allows the @xmath9 and @xmath44 to be tracked in the angle plots and as described in section  [ subsect : c4 ] the @xmath0 phase is seen for the @xmath20 0.32 and 0.34 samples .",
    "considering the temperature dependence of the angles , it is interesting to note that for the @xmath20 0.29 and 0.32 samples the angles show a strong temperature dependence and quickly either converge or begin to converge as the temperature is lowered , whereas for the @xmath20 0.34 and 0.45 samples the angles are nearly constant over the measured temperature range . noting the closeness of the angles of the two lower composition samples to @xmath8 , it is tempting to ascribe this behavior to a special preference of this structure to this angle . considering other analyses presented above , it seems unlikely and unsupported that the lattice is significantly more sensitive to the introduction of na near the parent compound than at higher dopings - the lattice anisotropy is linear in composition throughout this range - and therefore effects other than just the contraction of the lattice due to substitution must be contributing ; however , more work is needed to fully understand this behavior .",
    "panels i and j show the the two as - fe - as angles ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) at 300 and 10k respectively ( at 10k @xmath78 is the average of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the compositions with the orthorhombic structure ) .",
    "unlike the other hole - doped ba systems the smaller sr series with the lower cell anisotropy ( as measured by _ c / a _ and discussed in section  [ subsect : dopdep ] ) starts with an end member already close to the perfect tetrahedral angle of @xmath8 . upon doping the larger @xmath77 closes while @xmath78 opens until @xmath87 where @xmath8 is achieved and @xmath78 becomes the larger angle with further doping .",
    "comparing plots i and j it is clear that the composition at which this angle is achieved is significantly affected by the temperature : it changes from @xmath88 to @xmath89 between 300 and 10 k. it is interesting that despite the non - linear behavior of the lattice volume the doping dependence of the averaged angles appears linear across all measured compositions .",
    "the perfect tetrahedral angle at 10 k occurs at a composition near that of the start of the magnetic @xmath0 phase .",
    "it is likely that the proximity to the higher symmetry perfect tetrahedron might give way to a structural instability which leads to the re - establishment of the tetragonal structure . calculating the @xmath90 for all samples which show @xmath0 re - entrance in",
    "both the na doped  ( taken from reference ) and srfe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ it is found that only compositions with @xmath91 show the magnetic reorientation and the structural re - entrance .",
    "we suggest that a combination of the magnetic ordering temperature of a given composition and its proximity to @xmath92 should play a role ( along with considerations of the fermi surface ) in establishing the @xmath0 magnetic phase - explaining why the @xmath0 phase is not seen to extend to @xmath93 for compositions @xmath94 . the ability of the high @xmath2 sdw ordering temperatures to supress the formation of the @xmath0 phase has been corroborated by recent theoretical work , supporting this conjecture .",
    "@xcite     ( color online ) phase diagram of  transition temperatures determined from x - ray and neutron diffraction are denoted by half filled and empty shapes respectively .",
    "pm / t @xmath0 is the normal state paramagnetic tetragonal phase while afm / t @xmath0 is the magnetic tetragonal phase .",
    "afm / o @xmath2 is the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "sc  denotes superconducting samples independent of phase structure . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows the culmination of all discussions presented above in a  phase diagram .",
    "in contrast to previously published phase diagrams we have observed a robust @xmath0 dome which spans @xmath95 in composition space , stabilizes at the high temperature of 65 k , and whose extent is entirely within the @xmath2 dome - closing before the complete suppression of the sdw afm ordering.@xcite    interestingly , the re - entrance of the @xmath2 sdw phase as the ground state at compositions near @xmath96 reported here was predicted in recent theoretical work ref   which endeavored to recreate the features observed in the phase diagram produced in ref  . in their mean - field approximation jang .",
    "show that , for large dopant concentrations which also display low @xmath39 , the energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 sdw states become nearly equivalent , with the @xmath2 structure being slightly more energetically favorable . while not a feature observed by bhmer _ et al_. in  or in our previous work on  ( see ref  ) here , for , the behavior is seen as a clear separation of @xmath97 between the closing of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 domes ( fig  [ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "we attribute this difference between the hole - doped systems to the higher afm ordering temperature seen in the srfe~@xmath7~as~@xmath7~ parent material , which allows the sdw dome to persist to higher dopant concentrations and thus to compositions for which this near degeneracy between the two sdw phases occurs .    as recently reported for the  system ( refs  )",
    ", we observe a strong competition between the @xmath0 state and superconductivity . as opposed to the smoothly sloping superconducting dome archetypical to the iron pnictides we report a large plateau in the @xmath17 at the onset of the @xmath0 magnetic phase where the superconducting transition is nearly constant until the end of the @xmath0 dome where it immediately begins to climb to its maximum value of 36k for @xmath98 . whereas reference observed non - monotonic doping dependence to @xmath17 in",
    "we see no such decrease at the onset of @xmath0 .",
    "we report coupled simultaneous magnetic and structural transitions both at the well known structural and magnetic transitions to an orthorhombic afm structure and at the newly observed magnetic reorientation and tetragonal re - entrance , in general agreement with the strong magneto - elastic coupling in the hole - doped iron pnictide 122 materials .",
    "while in both the k and na doped  the @xmath99 occurs near the composition of optimum @xmath17 here it is achieved well inside the sdw dome .",
    "it is possible that this observation was simply a coincidence in the previous two systems , which we think unlikely , or that in light of the well known competition between the two magnetic phases and superconductivity the maximum transition temperature is not found at the perfect tetrahedral angle due to the strong magnetic ordering present in this composition .    with the observation of the magnetic @xmath0 phase in a third member of the hole - doped 122 iron pnictide superconductors it strongly suggests its universality to these systems .",
    "moreover , it suggests that this new phase is important to the wider material group and not just an isolated observation .",
