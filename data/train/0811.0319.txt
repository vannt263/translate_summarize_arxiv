    "the nonzero mass of the neutrino has been recently confirmed by neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , where neutrinos created in a flavor eigenstate are subsequently found to be in various flavors .",
    "however , these experiments can only probe differences of squared neutrino masses , but not the absolute neutrino mass scale , which remains still unknown . the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath3 ) decay nuclear process",
    "@xcite is considered to be one of the most suitable candidates to provide this information .",
    "@xmath3 decay is a lepton - number violating mode , which is forbidden in the standard model and that only occurs if neutrinos are massive majorana particles . the half - life of this process involves an effective neutrino mass that could be eventually extracted from the measured half - lives .",
    "since the double - beta decay process is necessarily dependent on the nuclear structure properties , lack of accuracy in the determination of the nuclear matrix elements involved in the process is a source of uncertainty in the information on neutrino properties that can be extracted from @xmath3 decay experiments .",
    "contrary to the @xmath3 decay , the double - beta decay with the emission of two ( anti)neutrinos ( @xmath4 ) can proceed as a perturbative process in the standard model and has indeed been observed in several nuclides .",
    "this standard model allowed form of the decay is used as a test for the nuclear models considered .",
    "the operators involved in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes are different . in the @xmath6 decay mode the operator connects the initial and final @xmath7 states via virtual @xmath8 transitions to the intermediate nucleus . in the @xmath5 decay mode",
    "the transitions to the intermediate nucleus may take place to many different multipolarities .",
    "nevertheless , the underlying nuclear structure involved in both processes is similar .",
    "success in describing the @xmath6 decay mode is a requirement for a reliable calculation of the nuclear matrix elements related to the @xmath3 decay .",
    "the nuclear structure calculation involved in the @xmath4 decay is not an easy task .",
    "being a second order process in the weak interaction , the nuclear matrix elements involve a summation over the full set of virtual nuclear @xmath8 states in the odd - odd intermediate nucleus .",
    "two leading microscopic nuclear models are commonly used to evaluate the nuclear matrix elements involved in the decay process .",
    "they are the nuclear shell model @xcite and the proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( pnqrpa)@xcite . the shell model approach takes into account all possible correlations but within a restricted valence space .",
    "it successfully describes the low - lying excited states , but has difficulties with the description of states at high excitation energies , in particular , in the region of the gamow - teller ( gt ) resonance for open - shell medium and heavy nuclei , where most of the double - beta emitters are located . on the other hand , pnqrpa calculations do not have these problems related to the limited model space , but relevant ground state correlations might be missing .",
    "in addition , these calculations are very sensitive to model parameters . one problem of the theoretical @xmath4 decay studies is whether the contributions of higher - lying states to the @xmath4 decay amplitude , which are apparently disfavored by large energy denominators , play an important role .",
    "as we have mentioned , this has important consequences on the reliability of the shell model and pnqrpa to describe the nuclear matrix elements .    in the eighties ,",
    "abad and collaborators suggested @xcite that in those cases where the ground state of the odd - odd intermediate nucleus is a 1@xmath9 state reachable by a gt transition , the transition through it could account for the major part of the @xmath4 matrix element .",
    "this conjecture is called the single - state dominance ( ssd ) hypothesis .",
    "if ssd hypothesis is confirmed , the half - lives for @xmath4 decay could be determined from single @xmath10 and electron capture ( ec ) measurements , experiments which are in principle much easier to carry out than the elaborated and time - consuming double - beta decay experiments . on the theoretical side , the possible realization of the ssd hypothesis for the ground - state to ground - state transitions would lead to a drastic simplification in the theoretical description of the intermediate nucleus , since now only the lowest @xmath8 wave function has to be calculated .",
    "if ssd is valid , this would increase the reliability of the small valence spaces used in the full shell model calculations .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", early tests of the ssd hypothesis were evaluated on the @xmath4 decay of @xmath0mo and @xmath1cd , two cases where the ground state of the intermediate odd - odd nucleus is @xmath11 . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the ec half - lives of the ground state of the intermediate nucleus , @xmath0tc and @xmath1 in respectively , were measured .",
    "combining these measurements with the already known @xmath12 half - lives , the ssd hypothesis was confirmed to some extent on those examples .",
    "experimental information on the ec and @xmath12 decay of @xmath2i is also available @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the ssd hypothesis was systematically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within a pnqrpa formalism .",
    "the analysis performed there showed that the ssd hypothesis is realized in most cases but the mechanism leading to this property is not unique . in some instances",
    "the ssd is realized through a true dominance of the first @xmath8 virtual state , while in other cases it is realized due to cancellations among the contributions from higher lying @xmath8 states of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "however , one should notice that the theoretical formalism used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is complemented with some adjusting of the single - particle levels around the proton and neutron fermi surfaces to reproduce the observed single - quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "in addition , the scaling factor of the strength in the particle - particle residual force is fixed in each nucleus by optimizing the agreement with the experimentally known @xmath13 and @xmath10 decay rates .",

    "the double - beta decay is a nuclear process characterized by a change of two units in the nuclear charge , while the atomic mass number remains unchanged . here",
    "we focus on the @xmath28 decay mode where two antineutrinos and two electrons are emitted ,    @xmath29    only the basic expressions are written here , more details can be found in refs .",
    "the half - life of the @xmath4 decay can be written as    @xmath30 ^{-1}= g^{2\\nu\\beta\\beta }   \\left| m_{gt}^{2\\nu\\beta\\beta}\\right| ^2 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the phase - space integral @xcite .",
    "the nuclear matrix element @xmath32 contains all the information on the nuclear structure involved in the process .",
    "the theoretical formalism used here is the pnqrpa based on a selfconsistent mean field that allows for pairing and deformation .",
    "we refer to this formalism in short as deformed hf+bcs+qrpa . in this formalism",
    "the nuclear matrix element can be written as ,    @xmath33    where the intermediate states are the @xmath8 excitations of the initial and final nuclei in the laboratory frame .",
    "we use the bohr - mottelson factorization @xcite for the total angular momentum states @xmath34 in the laboratory frame . the index @xmath35 in eq .",

    "similarly , the @xmath7 initial and final states are of the bohr - mottelson form    @xmath43 . integrating over the angular @xmath44 variables , we finally obtain    @xmath45    as it is well known ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) the bohr - mottelson factorization of the wave function gives the adiabatic limit of the exact angular momentum projection and is a very good approximation for well deformed nuclei .",
    "first order corrections to the bohr - mottelson factorization due to angular momentum projection are typically less than @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is larger than 100 for well deformed nuclei @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ mgt ] ) @xmath48 are the rpa excitation energies of the intermediate @xmath8 virtual states with respect to the initial ( final ) nucleus , with energy @xmath49 . the energy denominator is the average excitation energy of a couple of these intermediate states . the indices @xmath50 , @xmath51 run over all the 1@xmath9 states of the intermediate nucleus ( @xmath52 ) in the transition , and @xmath53 are the possible angular momentum projections of these intermediate states .",
    "the overlaps are needed to take into account the nonorthogonality of the intermediate states reached from initial and final ground states .",
    "their expressions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to compute the matrix element we proceed as follows .",
    "each initial and final even - even ground state is described as a pnqrpa vacuum . for each @xmath54 nucleus",
    ", a bcs ground state is independently obtained from a selfconsistent mean - field calculation on a large axially - symmetric harmonic oscillator basis , using a density - dependent effective interaction and a phenomenological pairing - gap parameter .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon effective force sly4 @xcite is used to generate the hf mean field , and the bcs equations are solved at each iteration with a value of the pairing gap obtained from even - odd experimental mass differences between neighboring nuclei @xcite .",
    "when the iterative process converges , a set of single - particle states is obtained with their corresponding wave functions , energies , and occupation probabilities .",
    "it is worth noticing that the quadrupole deformation of the nucleus in its ground state is obtained selfconsistently as the shape that minimizes the nuclear energy .",
    "separable gamow - teller particle - hole ( @xmath55 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath56 ) residual interactions are included and treated in pnqrpa @xcite . the corresponding coupling constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 have been used in this work with values @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 mev , which give a good description of gt properties when sly4 skyrme force is used , as we shall show in next section .    due to the many - body approximations performed in the calculation ,",
    "the intermediate 1@xmath9 states computed from the initial and from the final ground states are different , and a projection from one basis to the other is in order . to get the @xmath4 decay matrix element , every possible transition through all the intermediate 1@xmath9 states",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the amplitude of each transition is divided by an energy denominator , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ mgt ] ) .",
    "the energy denominators written in this way are obtained by replacing the lepton energies @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the energy of the emitted electron ( antineutrino ) , by an average quantity @xcite    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the @xmath66-value of the double - beta decay @xmath67 . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the ground - state energies of parent and daughter nuclei , respectively .",
    "the consequences of this approximation on the ssd tests have been studied in ref .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the next section .",
    "different ways of writing these energy denominators , which are all equivalent , can be found in the literature . in particular",
    "one finds    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the energy of the intermediate nucleus in the state @xmath72 . in the cases where the ground state of the intermediate nucleus is a @xmath8 state , the denominator corresponding to the decay passing through this state",
    "can also be written as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the @xmath76values corresponding to its @xmath12 and ec decay , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we study the contributions to the @xmath4 nuclear matrix elements from consecutive terms in eq .",
    "( [ mgt ] ) with increasing energy denominators .",
    "the main purpose is to check the validity of the ssd hypothesis by considering only the lowest - energy term in the summation in the cases of @xmath0mo , @xmath1cd , and @xmath2te , which are emitters with @xmath8 intermediate ground states .",
    "however , it is also interesting to check the extent to which the contributions coming from low - lying virtual excitations are able to reproduce the total @xmath4 nuclear matrix elements in a more general way .",
    "actually , the strong fragmentation of the gt strength within the deformed formalism suggests that a meaningful comparison of theoretical results with experiment should be done for the accumulated strength in a given energy range rather than a direct comparison of individual excitations .",
    "thus , we analyze the summation in eq .",
    "( [ mgt ] ) considering only the contribution of the intermediate ground state ( to test ssd ) , then the contribution corresponding to all the low - lying states ( to test llsd ) , and finally taking into account all possible contributions ( to get the complete result ) .",

    "we also have complementary experimental information based on charge - exchange reactions that can be evaluated and compared to the @xmath4 experimental nuclear matrix element , as well as to the theoretical calculations .",
    "the contribution involving low - lying states can also be evaluated from the experimental information including now charge - exchange reactions @xcite , and can be compared again with the total @xmath4 experimental nuclear matrix element , as well as to the theoretical calculations .",
    "we start this section by summarizing the experimental situation concerning the validity of the ssd hypothesis in the @xmath4 decay of @xmath0mo , @xmath1cd , and @xmath2te .",
    "the analysis is based on information extracted from ground - state to ground - state decay measurements of the intermediate nuclei @xmath0tc , @xmath1 in , and @xmath2i , as well as on information extracted from charge - exchange reactions .",

    "the notation used corresponds to the reaction point of view , where the @xmath80 strength corresponds to the @xmath81 transition and the @xmath82 strength corresponds to the @xmath83 transition .",

    "the experimental llsd up to 2.5 mev accounts for the experimental @xmath4 decay matrix element , while the calculations up to this energy account only for half of it .",

    "we use the ground states for initial and final nuclei with a shape that minimize the hf+bcs energy .",
    "the corresponding results are shown by the solid lines . in some instances like @xmath135ti and @xmath24se ,",
    "the minima correspond to a spherical shape ( @xmath136 ) , while experimental data @xcite indicate that these nuclei have a non negligible deformation in the ground state ( @xmath137 ) . in these cases",
    "we also show results obtained with the pnqrpa calculations based on the hf+bcs solutions corresponding to these non - zero deformations ( @xmath138 for @xmath135ti and @xmath139 for @xmath24se ) .",
    "the corresponding results shown by dashed lines in fig .  [ bb_accum ] are seen to agree much better with experiment .",
    "it is important to remark that particularly in the case of @xmath135ti , the hf+bcs energy has a rather shallow minimum in the deformation range from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , so that both solutions are equally plausible ground states of @xmath135ti .",
    "the grey area in the plots indicates the experimental range of the @xmath4 decay matrix element .",
    "the two limiting horizontal lines have been deduced from experimental half - lives @xcite using two different values of the constant @xmath100 , namely @xmath100=1.25 ( bare value ) and @xmath100=1.00 ( quenched value ) . in this case",
    "the theoretical results are not quenched .    typically , the @xmath4 decay matrix elements shown in the plots increase with the excitation energy of the intermediate states until they reach a constant value right after a rather prominent final step located between 15 and 20 mev .",
    "this last step , especially important for the double - beta partners with @xmath101 = 128 , 130 and 136 , is related to the @xmath117 giant resonance .",
    "the final value of the @xmath4 decay matrix element lies within the experimental region in most cases .",
    "important deviations are only found for the nuclei with @xmath101 = 130 and 136 . in the cases of @xmath101",
    "= 48 and @xmath101 = 76 , as already mentioned , the prolate shapes of the daughter nuclei give a better result than the spherical shapes .",
    "concerning the low energy contributions to the matrix element , the fastest increase appears in the double - beta partners with @xmath101 = 48 , 96 , 100 , and 116 , where around a 60@xmath109 of the total matrix element is reached within an excitation energy range of 2 mev , and to a lesser extent the @xmath101=150 case . in the other double - beta partners the contributions to the matrix element",
    "are more spread and the increase is slower . in general , important contributions appear from relatively high energies around the position of the gt resonance .",
    "thus , although neither ssd nor llsd hypotheses are clearly fulfilled in our theoretical results , one can see a tendency in most cases to exhaust at least 50% of the total @xmath4 matrix elements in a low excitation energy region of 5 mev .",
    "the only salient exceptions to this rule are the cases of @xmath101=82 , 130 , and 136 .",
    "in this work we have studied the @xmath4 decay matrix elements within a selfconsistent skyrme hartree - fock calculation with pairing and deformation , and with residual @xmath55 and @xmath56 interactions treated in pnqrpa .",
    "the analysis has been focused on the study of the validity of ssd and llsd .",
    "while the former has been tested on the @xmath4 decay of @xmath0mo , @xmath1cd , and @xmath2te , the latter has been checked on all the measured @xmath4 emitters .",
    "confirmation of that hypothesis has important consequences both experimentally and theoretically , since it could help to drastically simplify the experimental effort to get good estimates of @xmath4 half - lives on one hand , and to simplify the theoretical description of the intermediate nucleus on the other .    with this aim",
    ", we have studied first the @xmath142 strength distributions of the intermediate @xmath4 nuclei @xmath0tc , @xmath1 in , and @xmath2i in the low range of excitation energies , comparing the theoretical results with the available experimental information from the direct decay and from charge - exchange reactions .",
    "the calculations reproduce fairly well the experimental distributions at low energy as well as the position and total strength of the gt resonances .",
    "the result of the analysis performed concludes that ssd is experimentally realized in the case of @xmath0mo because its experimental @xmath4 half - life is roughly accounted for by the measured @xmath85 strengths connecting the ground states of the nuclei involved . on the contrary ,",
    "the ssd half - lives are underestimated in the case of @xmath1cd and are overestimated in the case of @xmath2te",
    ". however , these results are still not conclusive since the uncertainties arising from the insufficient precision of the experimental measurements of ft - values , of @xmath4 half - lives , and especially because of the uncertainties of the @xmath85 strength extracted from charge - exchange reactions .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the conclusion of our results is that clear evidences for ssd and llsd are not found within the present approach .",
    "this is at variance with the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , where strong support of ssd was claimed . however , we would like to point out that our theoretical llsd @xmath4 matrix elements agree up to factors of the order of 2 with our total matrix elements .",
    "this finding is in qualitative agreement with the results obtained in previous studies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref . @xcite it is stated that ssd results agree quite well with the total matrix elements even though they find in some cases discrepancies up to a factor of 2 .    with only two exceptions ( @xmath101=130 , 136 ) , our calculations reproduce the experimental @xmath4 half - lives when the whole energy range of excitation energies in the intermediate nucleus is considered . within the considered nuclear model we find that important contributions to the @xmath4 decay matrix elements arise from relatively high excitation energies in several cases , not supporting dominance of single or even low - lying states .",
    "further progress in both experimental and theoretical sides is still needed to clarify the importance of the contributions of the intermediate nucleus states to the @xmath4 decay matrix elements . in the experimental case",
    ", this progress can be achieved by completing the experiments with high resolution charge - exchange reactions to more nuclei of interest and extending the measurements of gt strength distributions up to the resonance regions .",
    "for further progress in the field , measurements of the occupation numbers in particle - transfer reactions @xcite are also of great importance . in the theoretical case improvements",
    "are needed in the treatment of the residual forces by using realistic interactions and improved parametrizations , especially in the particle - particle sector .",
    "the role of the axial - vector coupling strength should be also studied further because systematic indications in favor of strong quenching have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the single electron energy distributions of the outgoing electrons in the @xmath4 decay processes have been investigated under various assumptions ( ssd , hsd ) , as well as from theoretical calculations using an exact treatment of the energy denominators of the perturbation theory , i.e. , without factorization of the nuclear structure and phase space integration calculations .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis of nemo-3 data including the theoretical predictions presented in this paper could help to confirm or rule out the possible realizations of ssd and llsd .",
