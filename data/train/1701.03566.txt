    "are appropriately processed by a suitable decoder @xmath5 , e.g. , maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoder , zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver , or a minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver .",
    "considering the high computational complexity of the ml decoder , many research groups have addressed the design and construction of full - diversity stbcs that are matched to suboptimal _ linear receivers _ such as the zf and the mmse receivers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these linear receivers reduce the complexity of the decoding process by trading off some error performance with respect to ml decoder . in @xcite a new design criterion for full - diversity stbcs matched to zf receivers",

    "a rate loss is associated with the design of full - diversity stbcs compliant to zf and mmse receivers @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the decoding complexity , diversity , and the symbol - rate of stbcs for these decoders is summarized in table [ complexity_table ] ( given in next page ) . a new receiver architecture called integer forcing ( if ) linear receiver has been recently proposed  @xcite to attain higher rates with reduced decoding complexity . in such a framework , the source employs a layered transmission scheme and transmits independent codewords simultaneously across the layers .",
    "this has been referred to as the _ v - blast encoding scheme _ in  @xcite . at the receiver side , each layer is allowed to decode an integer linear combination of transmitted codewords , and then recover the information by solving a system of linear equations . although if receivers are known to work well with the v - blast scheme @xcite-@xcite , not many works have investigated the suitability of if receivers to decode stbcs . in @xcite if receiver has been applied to decode a layered transmission scheme involving perfect stbcs .",
    "such an architecture has been shown to achieve the capacity of any gaussian mimo channel upto a gap that depends on the number of transmit antennas .",
    "an interesting question that arises from @xcite is : what is the design criterion for full - diversity stbcs for if linear receivers ?    in order to answer the above question , it is paramount to characterize the structure of good stbcs for if receivers . towards that end",

    "the contributions of this paper is as follows : we study the application of if linear receivers to decode stbcs in mimo channels .",
    "we present a decoder error analysis for the if receiver in order to obtain a design criterion for full - diversity stbcs .",
    "we show that stbcs that satisfy a criterion called the non - vanishing singular value ( nvs ) criterion provide full - diversity for the if linear receiver .",
    "this is a stronger condition than the rank criterion @xcite for the ml decoder . in @xcite an outage probability based error analysis of the if receiver is presented for the v - blast scheme . as a special case of our error analysis on stbcs",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the error probability for the architecture presented in @xcite and show that the if linear receivers provide full receive diversity for such a scheme .",
