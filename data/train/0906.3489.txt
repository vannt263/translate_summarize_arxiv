    "in vivo neurons in cortical and other neural circuits experience a large background of synaptic inputs , acting as a source of noise .",
    "noisy inputs have an important impact on the dynamics of neurons , making neural responses highly variable and affecting many of their response characteristics @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem is thus to determine the output statistics of the neuronal activity given an input noise statistics .",
    "in addition , the knowledge of the neuronal firing properties can be used to explore large - scale networks using a mean - field approach . in this framework",
    "the stationary states of populations of interacting neurons are self - consistently obtained from their firing responses @xcite .",
    "this allows the efficient exploration of the parameters space and the characterization of the various regime of functioning of these networks . for these reasons it appears crucial to have an accurate estimation of the input - ouput relationship of neurons , especially , in presence of realistic synaptic currents .    in this direction",
    "we investigate the firing rates of integrate - and - fire ( if ) neurons .",
    "the firing frequency of neurons with instantaneous synaptic inputs was first obtained in ref .",
    "the effect of synaptic dynamics has been studied under various assumptions @xcite . here",
    "we derive exact formulae that include additional important features .",
    "first we take into account the presence of a finite refractory time , which leads to current correlations between spikes affecting the firing rate of the neuron .",
    "indeed , neurons at their reset potential will evolve with a synaptic current that is still correlated with the _ positive _ going current that made them cross the threshold .",
    "furthermore , we also consider the case of multiple inputs from different synaptic receptors , as it occurs in the vast majority of cortical circuits .",
    "the obtention of the firing rate can be recast into the form of a mean first passage time ( mfpt ) calculation .",
    "since the synaptic dynamics here plays a central role we have to consider a multi - dimensional fokker - planck equation .",
    "the nonequilibrium distribution of the synaptic currents at the reset potential implies that the proper phase space boundary conditions must be found self - consistently from the neuronal and synaptic dynamics . to cope with these issues",
    "we extend the recently developed tools by doering and coworkers @xcite . in this approach",
    "the relevant parameter is the ratio between the synaptic current and membrane potential time constants .",
    "similar considerations also appear in various areas of science when studying the escape rate from a metastable state .",
    "the present results are of special interest in the context of stochastic resonance or stochastic activation @xcite , where considerable attention has been paid to the coexistence of several colored noises with nonequilibrium distributions .",
    "the sub - threshold neuronal dynamics of integrate - and - fire neurons is described by the depolarization @xmath0 of the soma , which evolves according to an evolution equation of the form @xcite @xmath1 with @xmath2 the membrane time constant .",
    "the function @xmath3 governs the dynamics of the membrane voltage when no synaptic currents are present .",
    "for @xmath4 we have a perfect integrate - and - fire neuron ; for @xmath5 we have a leaky integrate and fire neuron .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the synaptic current and @xmath7 its associated input conductance .",
    "the synaptic current evolves according to @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes a gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance : @xmath10 .",
    "the synaptic current is thus exponentially correlated in time with a correlation time @xmath11 : @xmath12 in terms of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average current , and the noise intensity @xmath15 .",
    "this form of the synaptic dynamics arises when the neuron receives a large number of inputs during its characteristic time , as it is typically the case in vivo in the cortex @xcite . in the limit of instantaneous synaptic current , @xmath16 , or for times",
    "much larger than the correlation time @xmath11 , the dynamics simplifies to @xmath17 .",
    "note that the adjunction of the synaptic dynamics renders the voltage dynamics by itself non - markovian .",
    "the neuron fires an action potential when the voltage reaches the threshold potential @xmath18 .",
    "after an absolute refractory period of duration @xmath19 it is reset at the value @xmath20 . during the refractory period no further firing can occur .",
    "by contrast , even when the neuron is in the refractory state , the synaptic current continues to evolve under eq .",
    ", leading to current correlations of order @xmath21 between spikes .",
    "this source of correlations must be taken into account in order to obtain a self - consistent input - output relationship .    in the following",
    "we will work in the reduced variables @xmath22 where we introduced the parameters @xmath23 using the adimensional time @xmath24 we obtain the system of equations    [ evol.reduced ] @xmath25    the potential @xmath26 is such that @xmath27 , where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "the threshold and reset potentials become @xmath29 in these new variables .",
    "henceforth we will also refer to the variables @xmath28 and @xmath30 as the voltage and the synaptic current , respectively .",
    "the process obeys the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath31 p    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the joint probability distribution @xmath32 . we will treat @xmath33 as a small parameter , considering the situation where the synaptic time scale is smaller than the membrane time constant",
    "this is for example the case for ampa receptors , which constitute the main fast excitatory inputs in the brain and have a time constant @xmath34 ms smaller than the time constant of pyramidal cells , @xmath35 ms @xcite .",
    "note that the variable @xmath30 keeps a finite variance irrespective of the value of the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "following doering et al @xcite we have a singular perturbation problem for the quantity @xmath36 the latter gives the mean time a neuron spends at points @xmath37 before crossing the threshold .",
    "alternatively , this stationary problem corresponds to the situation where we perform a time average over a long trajectory where the neuron restarts its time evolution at the reset potential after firing and after its absolute refractory period .",
    "after some transients the time spent at each point in phase space will reach the stationary value @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the mean first passage time before firing then reads @xmath39 while the firing rate of the neuron is given by @xmath40 the factor @xmath19 accounts for the lowering of the firing rate due to the time spent in the refractory state .",
    "importantly , we must consider the additional dependance on the refractory time that appears through the mfpt itself .    to obtain the mean first passage time we first generalize the calculation of doering et al @xcite to the case where the synaptic current at reset potential follows an arbitrary distribution @xmath41 .",
    "this distribution will have to be determined self - consistently from the neuronal dynamics .",
    "the function @xmath38 obeys the equation @xmath42 q(v , z )   = - \\delta(v-\\eta ) \\mu(z ) \\",
    ", , \\ , \\label{g.eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the operator @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , it must satisfy the half - line absorbing boundary condition @xcite @xmath44 this condition stems from the observation that the probability current @xmath45 must be positive at the threshold potential for firing to occur .",
    "intuitively this corresponds to the fact that the potential can not cross the threshold from above .    for further reference",
    "we here introduce the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the hermite polynomials @xcite . the latter form a complete orthogonal basis in the inner product @xmath49 .",
    "hence we may introduce the quantities @xmath50 characterizing the distribution @xmath14 . note that @xmath51 and that @xmath52 is the mean of the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "we now insert the ansatz @xmath53 into eq . and collect terms according to powers of @xmath33 .",
    "the zeroth order corresponds to the white noise limit of eqs .",
    ", i.e. , to the limit where synaptic events are instantaneous .",
    "we have @xmath54 whose solution is @xmath55 with a yet undetermined function @xmath56 . at the next order of perturbation we find @xmath57 yielding @xmath58 with the yet unknown function @xmath59 .",
    "the second - order terms give @xmath60 \\ , , \\ , \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used that @xmath61 .",
    "the operator @xmath46 is invertible only in the subspace of functions spanned by @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "hence the term proportional to @xmath64 must vanish , leading to the following equation for @xmath56 : @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , the integrability condition for @xmath67 leads to the following equation for @xmath59 : @xmath68 the solutions of these equations that are integrable read @xmath69 and @xmath70/\\sigma^2 } \\qquad \\qquad \\nonumber \\\\ & + & c_1 \\sigma^{-1 } e^{[u(\\eta)-u(v)]/\\sigma^2 } \\theta(\\eta - v ) \\",
    ", ,   \\label{r1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the heaviside function .",
    "remarkably the first - order correction to the mfpt , and hence to the firing rate , only depends on @xmath72 , that is on the mean of the current distribution @xmath73 .",
    "note that the mfpt can be expressed as @xmath74 dv$ ] as the functions @xmath75 are the reduced densities , @xmath76 .",
    "we now have to determine the factor @xmath72 and the constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 self - consistently . in this regard ,",
    "we first consider the phase space boundary condition .",
    "the latter was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be summarized by the condition @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 the riemann zeta function .",
    "the crucial point to observe is that this boundary condition remains valid in presence of an arbitrary current distribution @xmath14 since , as shown by eq .",
    ", the presence of a non - vanishing mean current , @xmath82 , only affects the residence time in the region @xmath83 , leaving the region @xmath84 unchanged .",
    "hence the constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 take the values @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the factor @xmath87 is referred to as the milne extrapolation length as it characterizes the non - vanishing value of the probability distribution at the threshold potential .",
    "we now have to evaluate the value of the mean current @xmath72 at the reset potential .",
    "it must be determined self - consistently as the synaptic current remains correlated between spikes due to its finite time constant .",
    "accordingly , the probability distributions at the threshold and reset potentials are related as follows : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the green function of the synaptic current , which is given by a normal distribution for @xmath30 of mean @xmath90 and variance @xmath91 .",
    "consequently we have that @xmath92 where we used eq . with @xmath93 .",
    "the mean reset current is thus related to the mean threshold current .",
    "again , we can verify that , at first - order in @xmath33 , the expression for the probability flux given in ref .",
    "@xcite remains unchanged in the present situation , as already suggested by eq . .",
    "hence we find @xmath94 at first - order in @xmath33 .",
    "when the refractory time is large compared to the synaptic time constant the current will relax to its stationary distribution @xmath95 so that @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "when the refractory time vanishes correlations are maximal since the current distribution @xmath14 at the reset potential exactly matches the current distribution at the threshold , resulting in a contribution @xmath98 .",
    "the same method can be applied to obtain the full distribution of the synaptic current .    combining these results we obtain the firing rate of if neurons .",
    "an important case is the leaky integrate - and fire neuron for which the mean first passage time takes the compact form @xmath99 dw \\label{mfptif}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and erf is the error function @xcite .",
    "this formula interpolates between the two - limiting cases of zero and infinite refraction time previously considered in refs @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "similar expressions can be obtained for nonlinear if neurons as well .    the firing rate as a function of the refractory period",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] along with the result of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the firing rate is compared to the situation where the neuron is unresponsive during the refractory period but the corresponding current correlations are neglected [ i.e. , formula but with @xmath102 .",
    "the corrections due to the effect of the refractory state on the mfpt are significant , even at moderate firing rates .",
    "to investigate the validity of the expansion ( [ ansatz ] ) , we numerically obtained the firing rate as a function of the ratio @xmath103 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "the agreement with the first - order formula holds for the region @xmath104 . for ratios @xmath103 up to @xmath105",
    ", we found that the firing rate could be well fitted by considering the effective threshold @xmath106 as seen in fig .",
    "the effective reset potential @xmath107 appears unaffected by the second order corrections , as observed in ref .",
    "in particular , the dependance on the refractory period remains identical .",
    "we further consider the case where several synaptic inputs are present , i.e. , @xmath108 where the currents @xmath109 obey evolution equations of the form albeit with different time constants @xmath110 , means @xmath111 , and variances @xmath112 .",
    "we here assume that the synaptic time constants satisfy @xmath113 with @xmath114 of order unity , @xmath115 , so that @xmath110 are of order @xmath33 : @xmath116 .",
    "the calculations of the previous section can be extended to this case by considering the three - dimensional phase space fokker - planck equation . inserting the eigenfunctions @xmath117 into the expansion in powers of @xmath33",
    ", we obtain that the boundary condition now reads @xmath118 , where @xmath119 .",
    "we could not obtain the milne extrapolation length analytically , which was determined numerically to be @xmath120 .",
    "it replaces the factor @xmath121 in the present situation .",
    "the white noise limit is obtained from eq . with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and where the potential @xmath124 incorporates both input currents , @xmath125 .",
    "the first - order correction reads @xmath126/\\sigma^2 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the corresponding correction to the mfpt given by @xmath127 ( for simplicity we did not include the refractory state in this analysis ) .",
    "remarkably , this first - order correction only depends on the total noise strength @xmath128 and not on the ratio @xmath129 of the synaptic time constants . accordingly , as regards the firing rate , we may treat different synaptic currents as an effective single input with parameters @xmath125 and @xmath123 , even when they present different time courses .",
    "this effect is valid at first - order in the parameter @xmath33 ; the case of very long synaptic time constants compared to the membrane integration time was studied in ref .",
    "the generalization to @xmath130 synaptic inputs is straightforward and does not change this result .",
    "we have obtained analytical expressions for the stationary firing rate of integrate - and - fire neurons endowed with realistic synaptic dynamics .",
    "precisely we have included two salient features into the description : the presence of a finite refraction time on the one hand , and the presence of multiple synaptic inputs on the other hand .",
    "the finiteness of the refractory period of the neuron provides a new source of correlations interacting with the synaptic dynamics .",
    "since the synaptic dynamics has a finite relaxation time , neurons at the reset potential may still be correlated with the positive current that made them cross the firing threshold , resulting in an increased firing rate .",
    "this mechanism is important for fast excitatory and inhibitory synapses such as ampa and @xmath131 synapses as their time constants is in the range of @xmath132 to @xmath133 ms @xcite , comparable to the absolute refractory period of cortical neurons , @xmath134 ms .",
    "the presence of multiple synaptic inputs has been considered as well . in this case the milne extrapolation length must be determined numerically to complete the theoretical analysis .",
    "importantly the firing rate only depends on the variances of the synaptic inputs and not on their relative time constants .",
    "this allows us to consider the combined effect of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from , say , ampa and @xmath131 receptors .",
    "these analytical results are crucial to assess the effect of noise on neuronal dynamics .",
    "for instance they provide accurate expressions that can be used in the mean - field exploration of large - scale neuronal networks @xcite . in particular , the network collective properties , such as the stability of the low activity spontaneous state or of the persistent",
    "`` memory '' states , will depend on the transfer function .",
    "more generally , the study of nonequilibrium , multiple colored noises appears in a wide range of situations of concern , from chemical networks to biology .",
