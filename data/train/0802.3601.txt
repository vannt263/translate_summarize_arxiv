    "from the early years of quantum mechanics , searching for analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation has always been a subject of intense investigations , in particular when the hamiltonian possesses bound states .",
    "this is a challenging mathematical problem often involving complex differential equations , and several methods have been proposed to find approximate analytical solutions : wkb method , semiclassical treatment , variational method , perturbation theory , etc .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite for example , in which a wide range of analytical results concerning bound states are presented . nowadays",
    ", numerical calculations allow us to solve eigenequations very accurately .",
    "but , finding analytical solutions is still of great interest since it makes explicitly appear the dependence of the eigenenergies and wave functions on the various parameters of the model .",
    "such a property is particularly useful when one tries to fit the parameters of a model to experimental data for example . in the present work ,",
    "we propose a new way to obtain analytical approximate solutions of schrdinger s equations for bound state problems .",
    "our method is based on the auxiliary field technique .",
    "auxiliary fields , also known as einbein fields , appear in various domains of theoretical physics .",
    "they are commonly used to get rid of the square roots appearing in relativistic systems ; let us mention the nambu - goto lagrangian which is replaced by the polyakov one in string theory for example  @xcite .",
    "they also appear in supersymmetric field theories  @xcite and in hadronic physics  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly present the auxiliary fields with the simple example of a free relativistic particle , that is the lagrangian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the world - velocity .",
    "an auxiliary field @xmath2 can be introduced in this expression to get rid of the square root @xmath3 this last expression is formally simpler than lagrangian  ( [ exa1 ] ) , but it is equivalent if the equations of motion of the auxiliary field are considered .",
    "the auxiliary field is determined by the condition of extremum @xmath4 and if we substitute it into the corresponding lagrangian ( [ exa2 ] ) , we recover the original one ( [ exa1 ] ) : @xmath5 .",
    "this is a general feature of auxiliary fields : their equation of motion are not dynamical but rather algebraic relations that express them in terms of the other variables of the problem .",
    "we see that the introduction of auxiliary fields can notably simplify the formalism , and thus the computations .",
    "it was pointed out in  @xcite that relativistic hamiltonians can be rewritten as apparently nonrelativistic ones by such a method [ compare equations  ( [ exa1 ] ) and ( [ exa2 ] ) for example ] .",
    "we previously showed that auxiliary fields allow to express a linear potential , which is widely used in hadronic physics , as an expression involving an auxiliary field and a harmonic oscillator  @xcite . by doing this ,",
    "analytical mass spectra can be computed assuming that the auxiliary field is not an operator but a real number .",
    "that is why approximate results are obtained .",
    "the question is : could any arbitrary potential be expressed in terms of an equivalent expression involving an auxiliary field and another potential for which an analytical solution is known ? as we will show in section  [ grmeth ]",
    ", the answer is yes , and a general algorithm for analytically solving the schrdinger equation with any potential can be proposed . in sections  [ hoapp ] and [ capp ] , we illustrate our general method by computing analytical energy spectra for central potentials with power - law form and with logarithmic form . as",
    "our formulae are approximate , it is of interest to try to maximally improve them .",
    "this is done in section  [ impfor ] .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "we begin with a standard hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy term @xmath6 and a local central potential @xmath7 @xmath8 whose eigenvalues and eigenstates are a priori not analytically known . on the contrary , let us assume that the hamiltonian with potential @xmath9 replacing @xmath7 , namely @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a real parameter , possesses bound states with an analytical spectrum .",
    "thus , we explicitly know the solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath12 starting from the eigenequation  ( [ analy ] ) , we propose hereafter a way to compute an analytical approximate solution of the eigenequation @xmath13 @xmath14 being the arbitrary hamiltonian  ( [ inco ] ) .",
    "the procedure consists in three steps :    1 .",
    "build the function @xmath15 and the operator @xmath16 by the definitions @xmath17 so that the operator @xmath18 is given by the inverse function @xmath19 2 .",
    "introduce the hamiltonian @xmath20 through the definition @xmath21-\\rho\\ , p\\left[k^{-1}(\\rho)\\right].\\ ] ] @xmath11 is known as an auxiliary field . because of  ( [ analy ] ) , the spectrum of @xmath20 is analytically known if the auxiliary field is assumed to be a number , and not an operator .",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath22 , while the eigenenergies @xmath23 are obtained from @xmath24 simply by adding a @xmath11-dependent constant term @xmath25-\\rho\\ , p\\left[k^{-1}(\\rho)\\right].\\ ] ] 3 .",
    "the physical spectrum is finally given by the eigenstates @xmath26 and the eigenenergies @xmath27 , with @xmath28 minimizing the total energy  ( [ en1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath29    it is now time to justify the procedure given above .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath20 , given by  ( [ htdef ] ) .",
    "actually , one replaces in @xmath14 the potential @xmath7 , for which the energies are not analytical , by the potential @xmath9 for which they are , but via an effective potential @xmath30-\\rho\\ , p\\left[k^{-1}(\\rho)\\right]$ ] depending on the auxiliary field .",
    "such an auxiliary field is nothing else but a mathematical trick to simplify the formalism . in the present case for example",
    ", @xmath31 is  simulated \" by a function of @xmath11 and of an analytically solvable potential @xmath9 .",
    "the key point is that the auxiliary field , when properly eliminated as an operator , should lead to hamiltonian  ( [ inco ] ) . it can be checked that @xmath32 moreover , @xmath33",
    "this means that hamiltonians  ( [ inco ] ) and ( [ htdef ] ) are actually equivalent up to the elimination of the auxiliary field as an operator , the auxiliary field being then defined by  ( [ rdef ] ) .",
    "the approximation in our method is the following : if @xmath11 is considered as a number in hamiltonian  ( [ htdef ] ) , the corresponding eigenequation can be analytically solved , since only @xmath9 is involved .",
    "then , an energy spectrum of the form  ( [ en1 ] ) , which depends on the auxiliary field , is obtained .",
    "obviously , the physical value of @xmath11 for a given eigenenergy is the one which ensures this energy to be minimal .",
    "this is expressed in  ( [ enmin ] ) .    the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite states that @xmath34 using this relation and defining the quantity @xmath35 by @xmath36",
    ", one can show that @xmath37 this means that @xmath35 is a kind of  average point \" for the potential @xmath9 .",
    "if functions @xmath9 and @xmath7 are smooth enough , one could expect that the average point for the function @xmath15 does not differ significantly from @xmath35 .",
    "so we can assume that @xmath38 thus , we can expect that the optimal value @xmath28 should be close to the average value @xmath39 , with @xmath40 given by  ( [ rdef ] ) @xcite .",
    "our method could actually be considered as a ",
    "mean field approximation \" with respect to a particular auxiliary field which is introduced to simplify the calculations . this will be checked in the following .",
    "it is possible to obtain an analytical estimation of the accuracy of the method . with the notations introduced above ,",
    "let us compute @xmath41 . using ( [ inco ] ) , ( [ htdef ] ) and ( [ pr0 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath42 the r.h.s .  of this equation",
    "is the difference between the value of potential @xmath43 computed at the  average point \" @xmath35 and the average of this potential for the trial state @xmath44 . in some favorable cases",
    "@xcite ( the trial state is a ground state for instance ) , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the exact eigenvalue of @xmath14 .",
    "since this inequality can not be always guaranteed , we just can write in general @xmath47 in principle , all the quantities present in this formula , except @xmath46 obviously , can be analytically computed .",
    "so an estimation of the error on the absolute eigenvalue can be obtained .",
    "depending on the sign of the r.h.s .  of ( [ errana2 ] ) , @xmath27 can be an upper or a lower bound of @xmath46 .",
    "an estimation of the relative error is obtained by computing @xmath48 .",
    "numerical evaluations of formula  ( [ errana2 ] ) will be given in the following .",
    "formally , we thus have proposed an algorithm which allows to compute approximate analytical eigenvalues and eigenstates of an arbitrary hamiltonian containing the potential @xmath7 , provided that an analytical solution of the hamiltonian is known for a particular potential @xmath9 .",
    "this method leads to approximate solutions because of the presence of the auxiliary field , but , as we will see , it is a very convenient tool to understand the qualitative features of various energy spectra .    before giving explicit examples , three points should be stressed :    * one easily checks that the method is exact for @xmath49 , with @xmath50 trivially .",
    "one thus expects that , the closer is @xmath9 to @xmath7 , the better the approximation is . * generally ,",
    "the procedure is not variational , so that we have no certainties concerning the position of the approximate energies with respect to the exact ones . *",
    "the method is not free of technical difficulties .",
    "although the presented algorithm is completely general and in principle applicable to any situation , obtaining an analytical solution is not always possible or can lead to cumbersome calculations .",
    "in fact the crucial difficulty concerns the inversion of the function @xmath15 [ formula  ( [ invfunckk ] ) ] and/or the determination of the best auxiliary field @xmath28 [ formula  ( [ enmin ] ) ] .",
    "however , these difficulties can be overcome in many relevant cases and the corresponding equations can be fortunately solved .",
    "we can also notice that the method which is proposed here remains valid not only for central potentials , but also for general quantum mechanical systems ( one- and two - dimensional ones for example ) .",
    "let us first illustrate the general procedure presented in the previous section by solving the eigenequation associated to the nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in order that this hamiltonian possesses bound states .",
    "two power - law potentials are standard in quantum mechanics formalism : the harmonic and coulomb potentials because analytical solutions are known whatever the radial and orbital quantum numbers .",
    "this should thus be of interest to take @xmath51 or @xmath56 in our auxiliary field method . in this section",
    ", we will consider the case of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we recall that the spectrum of the schrdinger equation with potential @xmath57 is given by ( see for example  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 66 ) ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a normalization coefficient and @xmath60 the radial wave function ( @xmath61 is the radial quantum number and @xmath62 is the orbital quantum number ) .",
    "taking @xmath51 ,  ( [ rdef ] ) leads to @xmath63 we notice that for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is always well - defined since @xmath66 by definition .",
    "the case @xmath67 is actually of no interest since in this case @xmath68 trivially , and the results are exactly known .",
    "then , following  ( [ htdef ] ) , one obtains after some algebra @xmath69 we can easily check that hamiltonian  ( [ hpl1 ] ) is fully equivalent to hamiltonian  ( [ hzero ] ) if @xmath70 as given by  ( [ rdpl ] ) . in order to go further in the computation",
    ", we now consider the auxiliary field @xmath11 as a real parameter .",
    "as we already mentioned , this is at this place that the approximation is introduced .",
    "this procedure allows to obtain an analytical energy formula which reads @xmath71 the wave function is also readily known from  ( [ nrho1 ] ) in which @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "we will not write explicitly the wave functions in the following , since they can readily be obtained once the energy is known .",
    "the last step is the minimization of the energy with respect to the auxiliary field @xmath11 .",
    "one finds @xmath74^{\\frac{2(\\lambda-2)}{\\lambda+2 } } ( a|\\lambda|)^{\\frac{4}{\\lambda+2}},\\ ] ] and then the final form for the energy spectrum is @xmath75 it is interesting to notice that @xmath76 the formula is exact for @xmath67 as expected , since in this case @xmath49 .",
    "if , in the case @xmath77 , we substitute @xmath78 by @xmath79 , we recover the exact result for the coulomb case .",
    "of course , the presence of a term @xmath80 is a `` remembrance '' of the original function @xmath9 that we employed to treat the auxiliary field . the fact that a potential with a very strong increase for large @xmath18 can mimic the asymptotic behavior of the energies for a potential that tends to zero for large @xmath18 is astonishing and shows the power of our method to get at least the good asymptotic properties .",
    "we remark also that formula  ( [ eh ] ) is not defined when @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , the energy becomes positive when @xmath82 .",
    "we recover actually a well - known result : in an attractive potential with a singularity like @xmath83 with @xmath84 , the existence of bound states is not automatically guaranteed @xcite .",
    "we mentioned in the previous section that @xmath28 was expected to be close to the average value of @xmath16 .",
    "the average should here be computed with the wave functions @xmath60 given by  ( [ nrho1 ] ) in which @xmath85 .",
    "this point can be explicitly checked in the particular case we are dealing with .",
    "indeed , relation  ( [ rdpl ] ) shows that @xmath86 but , it is well - known that for the harmonic oscillator  ( [ nrho1 ] ) , one has @xmath87 .",
    "thus in our case , @xmath88 . using  ( [ r0def2 ] ) , we find after some algebra that @xmath89 this confirms the interpretation of the auxiliary field technique as a mean field approximation in which the corresponding field is chosen so that the calculations are as easy as possible .    using the results developed above , applied to ( [ errana2 ] ) , one can compute that , for the ground state , @xmath90.\\ ] ] for @xmath67 , the trivial equality @xmath91 is found since the method is exact in this case . for @xmath92 , it has been numerically verified that the l.h.s .  and",
    "r.h.s .  of this equation",
    "are respectively @xmath93 and @xmath94 . for @xmath77 ,",
    "these numbers become respectively @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in both cases ,",
    "the formula is verified . as expected , the relative error is smaller for @xmath92 than for @xmath77 , since the harmonic potential is  closer \" to potential @xmath18 than potential @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath27 and @xmath46 obey the same scaling laws ( see section  [ scale ] ) , inequality  ( [ ineq1 ] ) does not depend on parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we turn now our attention to the special case of a schrdinger equation with the logarithmic potential ( @xmath99 ) @xmath100 with the choice @xmath51 , equation  ( [ rdef ] ) can be easily solved .",
    "one finds @xmath101 and ( @xmath102 is the basis of natural logarithms ) @xmath103.\\ ] ] the elimination of @xmath11 from the minimization condition of this last energy formula finally leads to @xmath104.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is well known that the eigenenergies @xmath105 resulting from a schrdinger equation with the potential  ( [ plog ] ) satisfy the property @xcite @xmath106 the immediate consequence is that the corresponding spectrum is independent of the mass of the particle .",
    "it is remarkable that the basic property  ( [ proplogpot ] ) still holds for our approximate expression  ( [ elog ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the energy formula  ( [ elog ] ) can be understood as a particular limit case of formula  ( [ eh ] ) , as it was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the logarithmic potential can be rewritten into a power - law form , i.e. @xmath107 let us then consider the following hamiltonian @xmath108.\\ ] ] the potential term of this hamiltonian reduces to potential  ( [ plog ] ) in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "a simple rewriting of formula  ( [ eh ] ) for @xmath110 gives the eigenenergies of hamiltonian  ( [ hlog2 ] ) .",
    "we have thus @xmath111 and as expected @xmath112,\\ ] ] that is precisely formula  ( [ elog ] ) , directly obtained from the logarithmic potential .",
    "this confirms the idea that the logarithmic potential can be seen as the limit of a power - law potential @xmath113 when @xmath114 goes to zero .",
    "another obvious case of analytically solvable radial potential is the coulomb potential @xmath116 whose eigenfunctions and eigenenergies respectively read ( see for example  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 67 ) ) @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "it is thus of interest to choose @xmath115 and to perform the same calculations as the ones we did in the previous section .",
    "consequently , we will give less details and only mention the main steps of the computations .",
    "equation  ( [ rdef ] ) takes the form @xmath119 and the energy spectrum is analytically known once the auxiliary field @xmath11 is introduced as in  ( [ htdef ] ) @xmath120^{\\frac{\\lambda+1}{\\lambda+2 } } , \\\\",

    "however , the same qualitative behaviors in @xmath123 and @xmath124 are obtained .",
    "in particular , @xmath125 as expected , this method is exact for the coulomb potential . if , in the formula for @xmath67 , we substitute @xmath79 by @xmath78 we recover the exact result .",
    "once more , it is remarkable that using a potential @xmath9 which decreases at large @xmath18 , one can mimic the behavior of the eigenenergies due to a potential @xmath7 which strongly increases at large @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for large @xmath126 and @xmath127 values , both @xmath128 and @xmath129 are proportional to @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "such an asymptotic behavior is in agreement with the wkb analysis which is performed in  @xcite . the same behavior is also found in @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the auxiliary field method as a particular mean field approximation would be strengthened if we had @xmath132 as in the previous section , with @xmath16 and @xmath28 given by  ( [ rdpl2 ] ) and ( [ r0coul ] ) respectively .",
    "the average value should actually be computed with the eigenstates of hamiltonian  ( [ htdef ] ) in the particular case we are dealing with .",
    "these eigenstates are actually eigenstates of the following hamiltonian @xmath133 whose eigenenergies read @xmath134 by applying the virial theorem to this last hamiltonian , one obtains @xmath135 .",
    "thus , one has @xmath136 and @xmath137 a straightforward calculation shows that these two relations together with the definition  ( [ r0coul ] ) leads to @xmath138 , as expected .    using the results developed above , applied to ( [ errana2 ] ) , one can compute that , for the ground state , @xmath139.\\ ] ] for @xmath77 , the trivial equality @xmath91 is found since the method is exact in this case . for @xmath92 , it has been numerically verified that the l.h.s .  and r.h.s .  of this equation",

    "the resolution of the schrdinger equation with the logarithmic potential  ( [ plog ] ) is even simpler with the present choice of @xmath9 .",

    "this last equation can be rewritten with a different set of parameters ( denoted as @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ) and with the change of variables @xmath155 . after a further multiplication by the constant @xmath156",

    "however , in the special case of power - law potentials @xmath161 , we have a more powerful expression due to the fact that we have some freedom on @xmath150 and @xmath151 parameters . indeed , if these parameters are chosen with the constraint @xmath162 they lead to the same potential .",
    "this property allows to obtain the absolute dependence of the energies in term of @xmath97 and @xmath98 parameters .",
    "explicitly , we can write @xmath163 where @xmath164 is an eigenvalue of the dimensionless schrdinger equation @xmath165 this hamiltonian corresponds to the particular values @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this choice is made such that , in the exact cases , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "one sees that equations  ( [ eh ] ) and ( [ ec ] ) resulting from our treatment fulfills exactly this scaling law  ( [ scl1 ] ) , and that the dimensioned factor gives the correct dimension to the energy @xmath170 .",
    "so an approximate expression for @xmath164 , that is deduced from the auxiliary field technique , can be written as @xmath171 with the values @xmath172 for the approximation based on the harmonic function @xmath51 and @xmath173 for the approximation based on the coulomb function @xmath115 . in the next section",
    "we will show how to improve the results suggested by the previous studies .",
    "following the form chosen for @xmath9 , two different approximations ( [ egsolap ] ) are obtained for both power - law and logarithmic potentials .",
    "a comparison with exact results ( numerically computed ) shows that these formulae are satisfactory but it is possible to improve the results . using scaling laws presented above ,",
    "it is sufficient to focus our attention on the @xmath174 quantity .",
    "we propose here the following expression @xmath175^{\\frac{2 \\lambda}{\\lambda+2}}.\\ ] ] since this formula is exact for @xmath77 and @xmath67 , we must have @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 . moreover , we can expect that the use of @xmath115 will give better results for negative values of @xmath114 , while the use of @xmath51 will give better results for positive values of @xmath114 .",
    "so a natural choice would be @xmath180 the variations of the energy being smooth for variations of @xmath114 , we can refine our assumptions and suppose that @xmath181 and @xmath182 are continuous functions of this parameter ( the particular case @xmath183 will be discussed with the logarithmic potential ) .",
    "so one can first think to a linear interpolation between the two analytical cases @xmath184    nevertheless , it is possible to greatly improve the accuracy of the approximation  ( [ form1 ] ) by looking at numerical results . very accurate",

    "the curve is similar to a section of conic .     from  ( [ form1 ] ) as a function of @xmath114 , obtained from various approximations :",

    "solutions of the case @xmath92 are known for @xmath188 in terms of zeros of the airy function .",
    "approximate eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham_dim ] ) with a linear potential are given by @xcite ( this is an asymptotic form valid for large @xmath126 ) @xmath189 equating relations  ( [ airy1 ] ) and ( [ form1 ] ) , we find @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "assuming that this procedure can be extended for any values of @xmath127 , the conics can be determined by using the exact values @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "we find that hyperbolae give the best results ( minimal value of @xmath187 ) .",

    "in this paper , we propose a new method to obtain approximate expressions for the eigenenergies of a schrdinger equation based on any local central potential @xmath7 and valid for any radial @xmath126 and orbital @xmath127 quantum numbers .",
    "the method relies on the introduction of an auxiliary field @xmath11 .",
    "given a potential @xmath9 for which the analytical spectrum of the schrdinger equation is known , we presented an algorithm which transforms the solvable hamiltonian into the hamiltonian which contains the original potential @xmath7 and for which the eigenenergies are not known analytically .",
    "this transformation needs an auxiliary field which makes a bridge between @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "if the auxiliary field is considered as an operator @xmath202 which cancels the variation of the transformed hamiltonian , the algorithm gives the exact solution .",
    "we propose to start from the solvable hamiltonian and the corresponding eigenenergies expressed in terms of the auxiliary field , and consider this field not as an operator but as a pure number .",
    "if this number is chosen by a minimization procedure , the resulting energies gives a good approximation to the exact values . if @xmath203 our method gives the exact results .",
    "this method is applied to a power - law type of potential with power @xmath114 .",
    "the resulting expression for the energies satisfies the scaling law prescriptions and gives the good asymptotic behavior for the radial and orbital quantum numbers . comparing the results coming from the use of @xmath51 and @xmath115",
    ", one sees that they are identical provided that the @xmath204 term , remembrance of the harmonic oscillator , is replaced by @xmath205 , remembrance of the coulomb potential . owing to this remarkable property , we proposed new analytical formulae , valid for any @xmath114 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , that give results much better than the equivalent ones which could be found in literature since they are able to reproduce the exact results with an accuracy often better than @xmath206 .",
    "these formulae can be used for example if one wishes to determine the parameters of a power - law potential that fits the experimental data as better as possible .",
    "we also showed that the results for logarithmic potentials are obtained very easily from those of the power - law potential if one takes the limit @xmath148 .",
    "the main interest of our method is to obtain analytical formulae .",
    "its main difficulty consists of the inversion of some algebraical equations . in the wkb method , analytical formulae",
    "can also be obtained provided the integral over the radial momentum can be performed .",
    "depending on the particular problem considered , one or the other method can be more efficient . so the new method based on an auxiliary field , proposed here , can be a useful supplementary technique to solve eigenvalue problems .",
    "it seems very promising to obtain analytical expressions for the eigenenergies of a schrdinger equation with a number of interesting potentials .",
    "some of them are under study .",
