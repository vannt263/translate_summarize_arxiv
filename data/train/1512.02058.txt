    "liquid water and aqueous solutions , ubiquitous in nature , provide the native environment for numerous processes taking place in nature .",
    "detailed understanding of structural and dynamical behavior of water and the effect of simple salts ( or ion combinations ) on the same are thus critical to the understanding of further complex and interesting processes of biological  @xcite and environmental  @xcite relevance .",
    "many of the unique properties of water can be attributed to the ability of water molecules to form an extensively connected network of hydrogen bonds in which the four nearest neighbors of a water molecule arrange themselves in a nearly tetrahedral geometry  @xcite .",
    "this local structuring , in addition to the generally observed short range structure in liquids , owing to the excluded volume effects , has led to consensus in treating water as a highly structured liquid  @xcite .",
    "however , the precise definition of microscopic structure in water is not without ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "the structure of liquid water has been extensively probed using pair distribution functions ( pdfs ) among its atomic constituents using experimental as well as numerical techniques both in its bulk liquid phase and in presence of ionic impurities  @xcite .",
    "observed pdfs have suggested  @xcite that at ambient conditions , the structure of liquid water is short range and the spatial distribution of water molecules are uncorrelated beyond a distance of @xmath2 . however , pdfs yield a measure for density fluctuations alone and are devoid of information on orientational correlation , especially at longer separations .",
    "the mutual orientations of water molecules separated in space can , however , be envisaged through correlations involving dipolar and higher order multipole moments of the constituent molecules  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , while quadrupolar fluctuations have been observed to disappear within a distance of @xmath3 , correlations involving the dipolar degree of freedom of water molecules have been observed to be considerably longer ranged  @xcite .",
    "these dipole - dipole correlations were decomposed in the same report into transverse or the trace part , involving the alignment of the dipoles with respect to themselves and longitudinal or the traceless part , measuring the alignment of the dipoles with respect to the radial vector separating them  @xcite .",
    "both of these correlations show oscillatory solvation structure and are longer ranged compared to density correlations in water .",
    "the former vanishes beyond @xmath4 in liquid water in compliance with rotational symmetry .",
    "the latter , oscillatory in nature and always positive , was observed  @xcite to be non - vanishing even at @xmath5 separations and decays exponentially beyond solvation region ( @xmath6 ) with largest correlation length of @xmath7 . a non - vanishing alignment of dipole vectors with respect to each other over separations comparable to system dimensions would indicate the existence of spontaneous polarization in the medium .",
    "these results have been observed to be in good agreement with further numerical observations of long range angular correlations in liquid water  @xcite .",
    "another dipolar correlation of interest for bulk liquid water is the oxygen - dipole correlation which represents the propensity for alignment of a dipole vector to the radially outward direction when observed from the position of another water molecule .",
    "this correlation also shows oscillatory solvation structure at radial separations below @xmath6 and vanishes beyond the same  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations of such long range dipolar or angular correlation are not accessible to conventional spectroscopic techniques owing to the lack of positional ordering at longer length scales .",
    "however , recent hyper - rayleigh light scattering ( hrs ) experiments  @xcite have revealed the existence of long range orientational correlations longer than 230@xmath8 in liquid water  @xcite .",
    "dipolar correlations in liquid water have been studied for a variety of non - polarizable as well as polarizable models of water , including ( tip5p , tip3p )  @xcite and ( spc / e , swm4-dp )  @xcite . within",
    "the limitations of system sizes studied , the results for the various water models have been consistent . with",
    "the spc / e and swm4-dp water models , the longitudinal part of the correlations was qualitatively observed to be in agreement with the results for tip5p and tip3p water models  @xcite for radial separations @xmath9 .",
    "the longer correlation length of @xmath7 , however , requires considerably larger system sizes than reported  @xcite . in a recent work",
    "@xcite , correlation functions computed from hrs measurements were directly compared with the longitudinal and transverse correlations from md simulations  @xcite .",
    "while the experimentally observed correlations did not reproduce the oscillatory solvation structure , the asymptotic behavior was observed to be in good qualitative agreement .",
    "the long range correlations from hrs experiments were stated to have @xmath10 dependence , which indicative of the importance of dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "it is important to note that the long range behavior of the longitudinal correlation is not a consequence of long range electrostatic interactions , but has its origin in the fluctuations of the underlying hydrogen bond network of water .",
    "the same was established in our previous work , where truncating the electrostatic interactions beyond @xmath11 was observed to have no effect on the asymptotic behavior of the longitudinal correlation  @xcite . while hydrogen bonding interactions are intrinsically short range , the fluctuations of the hydrogen bond network are restricted by topological constraints .",
    "the entropy of hydrogen bond network thus has contributions from both single - water and collective dynamics  @xcite . in a statistical description of liquid water ,",
    "the hydrogen bond fluctuations need to be consistent with a sum rule , which states that sum of density of dangling bonds ( i.e. , a water molecules bond arms which are not hydrogen bonded to any other molecule ) and twice the density of hydrogen bonds should be equal to four times the density of water molecules  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the hydrogen bond network of water , governed by orientational fluctuations of water molecules , thus results in orientational correlations that are substantially long range compared to the length scale ( @xmath12 ) of hydrogen bonding interactions  @xcite .    temperature and density",
    "have been observed to have small but monotonic effects on the transverse and longitudinal dipolar correlations  @xcite .",
    "presence of salt ( cacl@xmath0 ) , however , was observed to have a considerably larger effect at reported  @xcite length scales of @xmath13 .",
    "the system sizes reported therein , with @xmath14 water molecules for cacl@xmath0 - water systems , are however , unlikely to capture the quantitative aspects of the effects of salts on the long range correlations .    over decades",
    ", effort has been made to characterize the effect of salts on the structure of water based on the ability of the dissolved ions to enhance or reduce the same  @xcite .",
    "consequently , ions have often been characterized as _ structure makers _ and _ structure breakers_. this putative notion has been recently subjected to considerable criticism , primarily owing to the absence of an unambiguous definition of structure in water  @xcite .    in the current study , we investigate the effect of multiple salts ( cscl , kcl , nacl and mgcl@xmath0 ) on the dipolar correlations for large system sizes using tip4p - ew and tip3p water models .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that structure making ( and breaking ) is not a generic concept , but crucially depends on the particular correlation in water . without invoking a definition of structure , we discuss the consistency of our observations in a general framework motivated by the sum rule and associated orientational entropy . for the same ,",
    "we invoke electrostatics driven orientational stratification of water molecules situated close to the ions . to quantify the same",
    ", we define a solute - dipole correlation which is a trivial extension of the oxygen - dipole correlation .",
    "finally , as a first extension to the case of non - ionic solutes , we contrast the effects observed for single salt molecules dissolved in water with the same for a methane molecule and show that hydrophilic and hydrophobic impurities of comparable sizes differ characteristically in their effects on the long range orientational correlations in water . we discuss the implications of this observation in the context of hydrophobic effect .",
    "the rest of the article is arranged as follows : in section ii , we define the dipolar correlations used in the current study ( elaborated in reference  @xcite ) followed by a description of systems studied and simulation details .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in section iii , followed by discussions and future directions in section iv .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the normalized dipole vector of a water molecule .",
    "statistical correlations among any two water molecules , whose oxygen atoms are situated at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , involving the dipolar degree of freedom can be formulated  @xcite as @xmath18 where indices @xmath19 denote directions in three - dimensional space , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the angular brackets denote ensemble averages .",
    "the decomposed scalar functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , defined as @xmath24 describe the transverse ( trace ) part and the longitudinal ( traceless ) part of the tensorial correlations @xmath25 . physically , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are measures for the statistical alignment of water dipole vectors spaced @xmath26 distance apart with respect to themselves and with respect to the radial vector separating them respectively .",
    "the oxygen - dipole correlation ( @xmath27 ) is defined as  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 takes a value of 1 or 0 depending on presence or absence of oxygen atom at @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the solute - dipole correlation can be defined through the same expression , where the density field for oxygen atoms ( @xmath31(@xmath32 ) ) is replaced by the same for a solute species .",
    "the oxygen - dipole and solute - dipole correlations represent the propensity for alignment of the dipole vector of a water molecule to the radially outward direction , when observed from the position of another water molecule or a solute respectively .",
    "classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed using simulation package namd 2.9  @xcite using tip4p - ew  @xcite and tip3p  @xcite water models .",
    "recently developed parameters that correctly reproduce the right coordination number were used for simulating divalent mg@xmath33 ions with tip4p - ew water model  @xcite .",
    "rest of the monovalent ion parameters for simulating tip4p - ew systems were taken from extensively used halide and alkali ion parameters available in literature  @xcite . for simulating aqueous solutions using tip3p water model , standard charmm parameters  @xcite , used extensively in biomolecular systems , were used for all ions .",
    "methane parameters were derived from aliphatic _",
    "sp3 _ carbon and nonpolar hydrogen parameters in charmm  @xcite .",
    "given the longest correlation length is @xmath7 for @xmath23 dipolar correlations  @xcite , cubic box lengths of @xmath34 need to be simulated for quantitative estimates of the same . as to enable the identification of any enhancement of the same , or the appearances of even longer correlation lengths , if any , considerably larger cubic boxes of dimensions @xmath35 were simulated in the investigations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 correlations .",
    "solute free water systems comprising of 36054 water molecules for tip4p - ew and 34194 water molecules for tip3p were initially equilibrated for 5ns under isothermal , isobaric ( npt ) conditions under a pressure of 1atm .",
    "the temperature was maintained at 298k for tip4p - ew and at 305k for tip3p .",
    "the system configurations at the end of the npt equilibration were used to generate 0.15 m and 1.0 m aqueous solutions of cscl , nacl , kcl and mgcl@xmath0 using _ solvate _ plugin of vmd  @xcite .",

    "while nacl , kcl and cscl still result in an enhancement of @xmath22 over that for solute free water for smaller separations , mgcl@xmath0 leads to a reduction of the same beyond the first solvation shell .",
    "the effect is most prominently observable beyond the second solvation peak , where presence of mgcl@xmath0 results in an anticorrelation in the transverse part of dipolar correlations .",
    "effects of nacl , kcl and cscl are also distinguishable at the higher concentration , with cscl resulting in a greater enhancement in peak heights for @xmath22 over nacl and kcl .",
    "the positions of the second and third solvation peaks are visibly shifted to left for all salts , the shift being maximum for mgcl@xmath0 .",
    "further , the appearance of a quasi long range nature in @xmath22 at the lower concentration ( 0.15 m ) is washed off at the higher ( 1.0 m ) ( see fig .",

    "the trait thus appears to be a general characteristics for salts with strongly solvated cations capable of inducing strong perturbations in the orientation of water molecules .",
    "longitudinal correlations @xmath23 are of greater interest over @xmath22 in the study of long range dipolar correlations in water since @xmath23 can be described as a truly long range correlation with an exponential decay  @xcite . in solute free liquid water at ambient conditions , @xmath23 has been shown  @xcite to exhibit solvation peaks till @xmath44 , beyond which it decays exponentially with longest correlation length of @xmath43 and is non - vanishing even at @xmath45 .",

    "the characteristics of this function are closely shared by another long range angular correlation function computable using classical density functional theory calculations  @xcite , further strengthening the likely existence of long range orientationally correlated domains of water molecules .",
    "it has been suggested from hrs observations that long range orientational correlations in molecular liquids are expressed through propagating waves in molecular reorientation instead of diffusional orientation of molecules  @xcite .",

    "however , the long range parts of the correlations @xmath22 and @xmath23 can still be seen to be capable of distinguishing the effects of individual solute molecules , further emphasizing the applicability of the correlations in investigating orientational correlations among water molecules ( fig .",
    "3 ( c , d ) ) .",
    "the @xmath22 correlations for nacl and mgcl@xmath0 can be seen to have the same qualitative differences as observed at 0.15 m concentration , both among themselves and with water in absence of solutes .",
    "@xmath22 correlation for ch@xmath1 is observed to be almost identical to that for solute free water , with indications of enhanced structuring , especially at larger separations .",
    "@xmath23 correlation for ch@xmath1 , however shows clear differences , being enhanced compared to solute free water .",
    "@xmath23 correlation can be observed to be reduced for mgcl@xmath0 , and comparable for nacl when compared to solute free water .",
    "the results clearly show that small hydrophilic and hydrophobic solutes have contrasting effects on the long range orientational correlations among water molecules,- the former causing reduction and the latter leading to enhancement .",
    "@xmath27 correlation around ch@xmath1 shows no long range preferential orientation , as expected from its charge neutrality and size .",
    "the results in this study indicate that the presence of dissolved salts ( ions ) leads to considerable changes in the dipolar correlations .",
    "such changes are both salt species and concentration dependent .",
    "the effects on the transverse and longitudinal parts of the dipolar correlations are considerably varied .",
    "the transverse part of the correlation is observed to be enhanced at lower ( 0.15 m ) concentrations for all salts with cscl , nacl and kcl leading to enhancement of statistically comparable magnitude .",
    "the presence mgcl@xmath0 at 0.15 m concentration is observed to lead to a greater enhancement in the transverse part for smaller separations , which is compensated at larger separations in comparison to the other salts . at higher salt concentration of 1.0 m ,",
    "the presence of mgcl@xmath0 leads to strong reduction in the transverse alignment of water dipoles resulting in anticorrelations over shorter ( @xmath61 ) separations , while the other salts studied retain the enhancement in correlation over solute free water .",
    "the longitudinal part of the dipolar correlation shows uniform reduction with salt concentration for all salts studied .",
    "the magnitude of reduction is further observed to be consistent with the relative positions of the cations in the hofmeister cationic series for both salt concentrations studied .",
    "interestingly , the long range exponential decay of the longitudinal correlation observed for solute free water is greatly reduced in the presence of salts , completely vanishing at the higher concentration studied .",
    "the reduction in the long range longitudinal correlation in presence of ions can be explained by considering ion locations as de - correlation centers . within their regions of influence",
    ", ions result in orientational stratification of water molecules and a consequent restriction in their orientational fluctuations .",
    "such local perturbations are coupled to the long range dynamics of the underlying hydrogen bond network through the sum rule . as a result , long range orientational correlations",
    ", whose molecular origin lies in the inherent fluctuations of the hydrogen bond network , get suppressed .",
    "further , the varied responses of the transverse and longitudinal parts of the dipolar correlations to the presence of salts at lower concentration ( 0.15 m ) , as well as the concentration dependent enhancement or reduction of the transverse part for the presence of the same salt ( mgcl@xmath0 ) further bolsters the criticism of the prevalent classification of ions along the lines of structure making and breaking .",
    "the contrasting effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic solutes on long range @xmath23 correlations can have interesting implications in understanding the long range ( @xmath62 ) component of hydrophobic force .",
    "it was suggested in our earlier publication that @xmath23 correlations can lead to a shape dependent attraction between two hydrophobic surfaces at large distances of separation  @xcite , decaying with a correlation length of @xmath63 .",
    "experimental evidences have shown that the force between hydrophobic surfaces , acting in spatial separation between ( @xmath62 ) , is exponential in nature , and the range , as well as the magnitude of the same is reduced in presence of ionic impurities  @xcite .",
    "our observations of reduction in the range of @xmath23 correlations is consistent with the same .",
    "the observations for methane can not be extended to extended hydrophobic surfaces in a straightforward manner . however , sum rule for water dictates that long range @xmath23 correlations in the presence of extended hydrophobic surfaces would be considerably altered compared to the same for water in absence of impurities , owing to the presence of dangling bonds at hydrophobic surfaces .",
    "future research would be directed at studying the effects of larger hydrophobes as well as surfactants and osmolytes on the discussed correlations .",
    "all the simulations in this work have been carried out on 1024-cpu annapurna cluster at the institute of mathematical sciences ."
