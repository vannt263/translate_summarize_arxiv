    "the galaxy as a whole affects star formation through the mechanism of spiral structure . stars in galactic disks tend to develop spiral - shaped density waves that arise either through spontaneous instability or through gravitational perturbations from nearby galaxies or a central bar .",
    "the spiral density wave modulates the gravitational potential in the disk , and the interstellar medium reacts non - linearly to this varying potential , gathering and concentrating the gas .",
    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) form , leading to a local increase in the star formation rate and the creation of giant @xmath6 regions .",
    "the cloud formation process is not well understood , and is the subject of ongoing investigation @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we measure the degree to which gmcs and smaller molecular clouds are concentrated in the spiral arms of the milky way , to provide a quantitative comparison with theoretical models of molecular cloud formation . in  2 , we take the bell laboratories @xmath0 survey data @xcite and use a brightness temperature thresholding algorithm to create a catalog of molecular clouds . from this catalog ,",
    "we extract a set of clouds that are definitely gmcs , and a set of clouds that are definitely smaller than gmcs . in  3 , we use surveys of neutral and ionized hydrogen to define the spiral arms . in  4 , we compare the locations of clouds in @xmath7-space with the spiral arm loci .",
    "we show that the gmcs and the smaller clouds have significantly different distributions",
    ". the gmcs are more concentrated to the spiral arms than the smaller clouds .",
    "a catalog of clouds was generated from the bell laboratories @xmath0 survey data @xcite using a thresholding technique described in @xcite .",
    "this survey contains @xmath8 pixels of @xmath0 data , each @xmath9 in size .",
    "survey pixels having @xmath10 are identified and grouped together in @xmath11 space to make a  cloud \" , where all the pixels constituting the cloud are above the threshold and also adjacent to at least one other pixel that is also above the threshold .",
    "a  cloud \" is then a connected volume of pixels , all of which are above the threshold . applying the thresholding method with @xmath12 on the bell laboratories @xmath0 survey yields a catalog of 1,400 clouds . as further described in @xcite , we assign several possible distances to each cloud based on our knowledge of the velocity field of the galaxy . essentially , the distances correspond to the `` near '' and `` far '' points of the distance ambiguity ( cf . mihalas 1968 ) , plus some additional uncertainty due to random motions .",
    "each cloud has a range of possible distances .",
    "we want to distinguish gmcs from smaller clouds , but the distances are uncertain , and so are the luminosities and estimated masses .",
    "we can , however , derive a subset of the catalog that contains only gmcs , and another subset that that contains only clouds that are definitely smaller than a gmc . for the purposes of this _ letter _ , we define a gmc as a member of our catalog with @xmath13 .",
    "the mass corresponding to this luminosity is @xmath14 , based on the mass - luminosity relation @xmath15 l({^{13}\\mathrm{co}})$ ] derived in @xcite for clouds identified by the method we use here . for each cloud in the catalog ,",
    "we calculate the range of luminosities corresponding to the range of possible distances .",
    "if all these possible luminosities exceed the luminosity threshold @xmath13 , the cloud is definitely a gmc , regardless of the distance uncertainties . applying this criterion to the catalog yields 56 gmcs .",
    "if all the possible luminosities fall below the threshold , the cloud is definitely not a gmc , and the cloud is included in the `` definite small cloud '' set .",
    "this second criterion yields 1257 small clouds .",
    "our catalog also contains 87 clouds that do not fulfill either criterion .",
    "these are moderately - large clouds whose distance is not well determined , and we exclude them from further consideration .",
    "spiral arms in the milky way have been identified in surveys of 21 cm atomic hydrogen and radio recombination lines .",
    "here we adopt the analyses of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , to determine the locations of the spiral arms in @xmath16 space : we take locations defining the spiral arms from these references , and interpolate using cubic spline functions .",
    "the loci of the arms are well - determined for @xmath17 , but not for the galactic center region .",
    "we therefore exclude from further analysis all clouds with @xmath18 .",
    "this reduces the samples to 39 gmcs and 932 smaller clouds .",
    "the locations of the clouds , and the locations of the spiral arms , are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the spiral arms are identified by letters , as in @xcite .",
    "drawing the spiral arms onto the @xmath16 diagram of the milky way has been controversial .",
    "the criteria adopted by the above authors for the placement of the arms are subjective and ill - defined .",
    "arms `` a '' and `` b '' , the local arm and the lindblad ring , are not large - scale features of the galaxy , but local spurs that loom large because they are close to the sun .",
    "spiral arms `` a '' through `` f '' are adopted here because they are traditional and because there is no alternative ; the analysis below will , however , be seen to support this initial choice .",
    "almost all the gmcs ( red circles ) lie close to spiral arms .",
    "the most notable exceptions are the gmcs in the bridge between the sagittarius ( c ) and scutum ( d ) arms near @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the local spiral arm and lindblad ring ( a and b ) contain no gmcs within the area of sky covered by the bell labs survey . as noted by @xcite , the perseus arm ( f ) is particularly distinct and well - separated from surrounding material .",
    "there is at least one spiral arm at some velocity for each value of @xmath21 in figure 1 .",
    "we can therefore define a `` concentration statistic '' for each cloud : the absolute value of the separation in velocity between that cloud and the nearest spiral arm , @xmath22 .",
    "the set of @xmath22 for each of our cloud samples is the distribution of separations of those clouds from the spiral arm loci .",
    "these distributions are plotted in figure 2 for the gmc and small cloud samples .",
    "the small cloud distribution has a long tail , containing about 10% of all clouds , that extends to large values of @xmath22 .",
    "most of these are near @xmath23 , where we have a long line of sight that falls between spiral arms and includes the tangent velocity , where the phase space density is high .",
    "these are clear examples of interarm clouds .",
    "all but five of the gmcs have @xmath24 . of those five , four are clouds in the sagittarius - scutum bridge @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic @xcite is the largest vertical separation between the two distributions , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the hypothesis that the two sets of @xmath22 are drawn from the same parent distribution is rejected at the 94% level by the kolmogorov - smirnov test  it is highly likely that the gmcs are distributed differently with respect to the spiral arms than are the small clouds .",
    "the two distributions have significantly different medians .",
    "the median @xmath22 for the gmcs is @xmath4 , whereas the median @xmath22 for the small clouds is @xmath5 .",
    "the errors in the medians are estimated by the bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "we will compare these results with the concentration statistics of objects that have the same radial distribution and velocity dispersion as molecular clouds but are azimuthally symmetric , and therefore have no concentration to spiral arms .",
    "the radial distribution can be parameterized by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface density of objects , @xmath27 is radius from the galactic center , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters .",
    "the galactic rotation curve is taken to be flat , at a velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the velocity dispersion is gaussian , with a one - dimensional root - mean - square of @xmath31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a set of monte carlo objects were generated by the following steps : ( 1 ) choose a set of parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "( 2 ) use a random number generator to create a set of objects in two dimensions that have a radial distribution given by equation 1 .",
    "( 3 ) calculate the @xmath21 and @xmath32 of each object as seen from the sun at @xmath33 . ( 4 ) generate a random gaussian deviate for each object from a distribution with @xmath34 and zero mean , and add it to each @xmath32 .",
    "( 5 ) compare the resulting set of random @xmath35 values to the catalog of actual molecular clouds , using a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite . ( 6 ) go back to step 1 , varying parameters to maximize the similarity between the random set of objects and the observed catalog .",
    "this procedure results in the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "this value of @xmath30 should not be taken to be a measure of the sun s rotational velocity .",
    "if the rotation curve were parameterized as @xmath40 , then @xmath41 can not be constrained by fitting to objects in the inner galaxy : galactic kinematics looks the same with a solid - body term added to the rotation curve .",
    "these data do not constrain @xmath28 very well either , since our cutoff at @xmath42 eliminates much of the molecular hole at @xmath43 .",
    "the shape of the inner edge of this hole is parameterized by @xmath28 , and almost all values of @xmath28 between 2 and 3 fit well .",
    "the quick drop - off of the molecular ring to larger radii , @xmath37 , is typical of fits to first quadrant molecular line surveys @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is consistent with the value @xmath44 determined for moderately - large clouds near the sun by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath22 values for the monte carlo objects is plotted in green in figure 2 , and their median value of @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "this value is robust , in the sense that essentially any azimuthally - symmetric distribution of random objects in the galactic plane that we have tried will produce a median value of @xmath45 that is greater than @xmath47 .",
    "the small molecular clouds are more concentrated to spiral arms than random objects , and the gmcs are even more concentrated than the small clouds .",
    "it is unfortunate that we can not observe the milky way from the outside , and see the spatial relationship between the molecular clouds and the spiral arms directly .",
    "interferometric observations of co in other galaxies having well - defined spiral structure shows that the co emission is concentrated to the spiral arms @xcite . in the milky way ,",
    "most of the co emission is from gmcs .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "here we have taken the catalog subset discussed in @xcite , where the clouds were selected to have well - determined distances , and further restricted that subset to clouds with @xmath48 .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution of virial masses for these clouds .",
    "the vast majority of the co - emitting material , over 85% , is in the gmcs .",
    "since the co luminosity per molecule is approximately constant @xcite , the majority of the co luminosity will also arise in gmcs .",
    "it seems likely that this is true of all spiral galaxies , and that the concentration of co to spiral arms is principally a concentration of gmcs to the spiral arms .",
    "given the median velocity separations derived in  4 , we can estimate the typical size of the spatial deviations from the spiral arms .",
    "the distributions of @xmath49 values are approximately gaussian for small values , ignoring the long tails . for purposes of this estimate , we assume that the spatial deviations from the arms are also gaussian .",
    "let @xmath50 be the gaussian velocity variance ; its square root is proportional to the observed median , @xmath51 : @xmath52 or @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "so @xmath55 for the small clouds and @xmath56 for the gmcs .",
    "we know that the one - dimensional root - mean - square velocity dispersions of clouds are @xmath57 for moderate - sized clouds ( @xmath58 , stark & brand 1989 ) and @xmath59 for gmcs ( @xmath60 , stark & lee 2005 ) .",
    "this dispersion will , approximately , add in quadrature with the amount of velocity separation caused by the spatial deviations and the rotation curve , @xmath61 : @xmath62 a typical spatial deviation of the clouds from the spiral arm is then @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a typical change in radial velocity with distance due to galactic rotation .",
    "the estimated separation , @xmath65 , which applies to both the small clouds and the gmcs , is small compared to the scale of a spiral arm .",
    "we do not want to make too much of this rough estimate , but we can say that aside from the long tail in the distribution of @xmath49 values , the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the spatial concentration of most molecular clouds to the spiral arms is high .",
    "the complete picture of the interaction of molecular clouds with spiral arms is a dynamical process in six - dimensional phase space .",
    "the bell laboratories @xmath0 survey provides statistical information about two spatial and one velocity dimension .",
    "we have seen in @xcite that , on average , the gmcs are tightly concentrated to the galactic plane , with a fwhm scaleheight about 30 pc .",
    "we now see that these same gmcs are concentrated to the spiral arms as well .",
    "most clouds are associated with spiral arms , aside from the outliers that are examples of interarm clouds . among clouds near the arms ,",
    "the gmcs are significantly more concentrated to the arms in velocity than are the small clouds .",
    "we thank the members of the bell laboratories radio physics research group during the ten - year period of the bell labs @xmath0 survey : r. w. wilson , j. bally , d. mumma , w. bent , w. langer , g. r. knapp , and m. pound .",
