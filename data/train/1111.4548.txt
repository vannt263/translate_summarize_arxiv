    "uranium oxides , especially uranium dioxide ( uo@xmath0 ) , are interesting materials from a fundamental point of view , not only because of their complex electronic structure arisen from partially filled 5@xmath3 electron shells and as materials of great technological importance in nuclear applications , but also because they are typical nonstoichiometric compounds .",
    "uo@xmath0 manifests fluorite structure at all temperatures up to the melting point and pressures up to 40gpa,@xcite as well as a wide range of off - stoichiometry.@xcite a comprehensive understanding of its thermodynamical , structural , and kinetic properties under extreme conditions is very important , especially for nuclear industry since uo@xmath0 is the main fuel component for pressurized water reactors .",
    "point defects are the key contents for these properties , particularly under irradiation as they play a major role in atomic diffusion .",
    "they also act as accommodation of the strong stoichiometry variations that exist in this material and provide incorporation sites for the fission products .",
    "there are some theoretical studies on the properties of point defects@xcite and their incorporation with fission products@xcite in uo@xmath0 at atomic - scale .",
    "early literature used mainly empirical potentials,@xcite while recently the ones based on density functional theory ( dft ) prevail . since the standard local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional fails to reproduce the fact that uo@xmath0 is a mott - hubbard insulator with an energy gap split by the strongly correlated uranium @xmath2 electrons,@xcite current _ state of the art _ approaches make use of dft+__u _ _ formalism or the hybrid functional method to describe the electronic structure of uo@xmath0.@xcite with these methods , the formation energy of point defects in uo@xmath0 at zero kelvin were extensively studied,@xcite including both neutral and charged defects .",
    "the population of point defects at finite temperatures and partial oxygen pressures were also investigated based on these 0k formation energies .",
    "after these efforts , understanding of the electronic structure , magnetic ordering , atomic structural geometry , and energetics of perfect uo@xmath0 and single point defects in it was advanced enormously .",
    "nevertheless a fundamental experiment observation that oxygen defects predominate in the hyperstoichiometric regime still can not be reproduced , even at a qualitative level.@xcite only one lsda+__u _ _ calculation predicted the predominance of oxygen interstitial in this region.@xcite however , the agreement is quite marginal . on the other hand , if taking oxygen defect clustering into account , the predominance of oxygen defects in a form of cuboctahedral cluster can be easily established,@xcite indicating the complicated nature of this problem .",
    "furthermore , almost all of the previous investigations predicted a negative formation energy for single oxygen interstitial o@xmath4 , except one of the dft+__u _ _ calculations with a gga exchange - correlation functional that predicted a positive value of 0.1ev.@xcite this is sharply in contrast to other dft+__u _ _ and empirical results which usually are about @xmath5ev.@xcite it does not sound unreasonable considering that the hyperstoichiometric phase of uo@xmath0 is unstable at 0k.@xcite however , it is worthwhile to note that a negative formation energy of o@xmath4 does not conflict with this observation too , since oxygen clusters have a lower energy@xcite and phase separation between the ordered phases of fluorite uo@xmath0 and u@xmath6o@xmath7@xcite could also lead to the same phase diagram",
    ". nevertheless , a formation energy of o@xmath4 being apparently positive indicates a different oxidization mechanism , in which the lattice vibrations , or equivalently the phonons , should play a pivotal role at finite temperature and therefore alter the sign of the formation energy .",
    "this part of the contribution to the stability of defects in uo@xmath8 , however , was totally absent in almost all of the previous investigations .",
    "it now becomes imperative to assess the role played by this part of free energy on the energetics of defects .",
    "in addition to reducing the free energy , lattice vibration at high temperature also leads to thermal expansion .",
    "the resultant dilation of the system volume inevitably changes the equilibrium 0k formation energy .",
    "the influence of this effect on defect populations , as well as that due to possible residual stress arisen from irradiation damages , are unclear , which is possibly a partial consequence of the fact that the hydrostatic compression behavior and the equation of state ( eos ) of solid uo@xmath8 drew little attention in the past decades.@xcite these mechanical properties now become important .",
    "it is crucial to know how the fuel components respond to shock waves generated at nearby explosions to assess the general safety of nuclear reactors and spent fuel storage facilities .",
    "attempts to address these problems require a profound understanding of defects behavior at high - temperature high - pressure conditions , as well as a full eos for non - stoichiometric fuel compounds .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the importance of lattice vibration and hydrostatic compression on the energetics and population of point defects in uo@xmath0 with dft+__u _ _ calculations .",
    "an equation of state model for off - stoichiometric uo@xmath8 is then developed .",
    "it will benefit the understanding of other compounds since uo@xmath0 is a typical non - stoichiometric oxide , and an eos theory developed for it can be easily adapted for other alike materials .",
    "we also attempt to answer the question of whether oxygen clusters are definitely necessary or not in order to make oxygen defects the major component when contributions of phonon and thermal expansion have been taken into account .",
    "in addition , in order to demonstrate the overall trend of oxidation effects and highlight the crucial role played by uo@xmath8 , the energetics and electronic structures of uranium monoxide ( uo ) , triuranium octoxide ( u@xmath9o@xmath10 ) , and uranium trioxide ( uo@xmath9 ) are investigated as well .",
    "the calculation methodology and the theoretical formalism are presented in the next section .",
    "the results and discussion are given in sec .",
    "iii , which is then followed by a summary of the main conclusions .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we studied the @xmath11-u@xmath9o@xmath10 phase by computing its atomic geometry , electronic structure , and energetics .",
    "table [ tab : u3o8 ] lists the calculated structure parameters by comparing with gga+__u__@xcite and experimental@xcite results .",
    "it can be seen that although pure gga calculations with pbe functional fail to predict the correct insulator state , the optimized geometry is in good agreement with experimental measurements , except a slightly shorter @xmath19 axis and a longer @xmath20 axis were obtained .",
    "deviation of the predicted equilibrium volume from the measured ones is less than 2% .",
    "in contrast , gga+__u _ _ predicts a much worse result , with the equilibrium volume about 6% larger.@xcite this is quite similar to the embarrassing situation encountered by the gga+__u _ _ approach in uo@xmath0 , where a remarkable underestimation of the structural binding was also obtained.@xcite considering the acceptable performance of pure gga on the energetics and eos of uo@xmath0 , we can expect that it will give reasonable results for the properties of u@xmath9o@xmath10 of interest here , even if a wrong half - metallic groundstate was predicted .",
    "the electronic structure of non -",
    "magnetic @xmath11-u@xmath9o@xmath10 shows that it is metallic with the fermi level pinned at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "the energy gap below it is about 2.2ev .",
    "the fm ordering phase has an energy about 0.3ev lower per conventional cell than the nm ordering one , and is half - metallic .",
    "this energy gain is from pushing the minor spin component of the 5@xmath3 band away from the fermi level .",
    "however , the remaining 5@xmath3 electrons on uranium atoms occupy the major spin band and partially localize at the fermi level ( see the middle panel of fig.[fig : uo - dos ] ) .",
    "if hubbard on - site correction were applied , the narrow 5@xmath3 band would be completely pushed away from the fermi level and result in an insulator solution .",
    "local magnetic moment is a helpful indicator for the localization degree of 5@xmath3 electrons .",
    "it is about @xmath21 per uranium atom for uo and @xmath22 for uo@xmath0,@xcite suggesting there are almost two 5@xmath3 electrons being partially localized .",
    "the difference is that in uo the localized electrons are at the fermi level in the conduction band , whereas in uo@xmath0 the on - site hubbard interaction splits the 5@xmath3 band and leads to an energy gap ( _ i.e. _ , being mott insulator ) , thus the electrons are localized in the valence band .",
    "on the other hand , u@xmath9o@xmath10 is close to being a charge - transfer insulator , in which 5@xmath3 electrons are absorbed by oxygen to fill the empty @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "but this process is incomplete and the remaining partially localized 5@xmath3 electrons in the conduction band pinned at the fermi level contribute about @xmath24 per uranium atom , and make u@xmath9o@xmath10 a half - metallic ferromagnet in gga approximation . to open up the energy gap ,",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion correction must be involved , and thus u@xmath9o@xmath10 is an intermediate phase between the mott insulator and the charge transfer insulator , as shown by the gga+__u _ _",
    "calculation.@xcite this picture is in accordance with nominal chemical valence counting : on average each uranium atom bonds with @xmath25 more oxygen in u@xmath9o@xmath10 than in uo@xmath0 , thus it loses about @xmath26 more electrons in the former compound .",
    "namely , most parts of the two localized 5@xmath3 electrons has been transferred to oxygen and only a small portion ( @xmath27 electrons ) is left behind .",
    "this charge transfer naturally creates a sharp energy gap just below the fermi level , resulting in an almost closed shell on the uranium cores .",
    "we therefore predict that uo@xmath9 would be a pure charge - transfer insulator with the bare uranium ions in the closed - shell rn configuration .",
    "calculations on the @xmath12 phase of uo@xmath9 confirms this argument .",
    "@xmath12-uo@xmath9 is a cubic phase in reo@xmath9 structure with a space group @xmath28.@xcite the lower panel in fig.[fig : uo - dos ] illustrates its calculated electronic dos .",
    "it is a non - magnetic insulator .",
    "no any local magnetic moment on the uranium atoms can be observed .",
    "a distinct band gap of 1.6ev can be clearly seen , which is due to the transfer of electrons to oxygen atoms , and leaves behind an empty atomic like 5@xmath3 band . as a result ,",
    "the fermi level moves to the top of the valence band .",
    "this completes the electronic structure evolution of uranium oxides along the oxidation process , _ i.e. _ , from metal ( @xmath11-u and uo , nm / fm ) to mott insulator ( uo@xmath0 , afm ) , to intermediate insulator ( u@xmath9o@xmath29 , fm ) , and then to pure charge transfer insulator ( uo@xmath9 , nm ) with a gradual shifting of the 5@xmath3 electrons from uranium to oxygen atoms ( see fig.[fig : uo - dos ] ) .",
    "the correlation effect among 5@xmath3 orbitals also changes from one end to the other : in uo@xmath0 it is the strongest , whereas in uo@xmath9 we expect no strongly correlated effect to present at all .",
    "this can be verified by the correct prediction of the insulator groundstate of @xmath12-uo@xmath9 with the pure gga approach , as well as the excellent agreement of the cubic lattice parameter between the calculated value of 4.168 and the experimental one of 4.165.@xcite    -u@xmath9o@xmath10 , and @xmath12-uo@xmath9 at zero kelvin compared with that of uo@xmath8 ; the latter spans a quite broad pressure range .",
    ", width=3 ]      the ordered phase of u@xmath30o@xmath31 has a complicated structure consisting of @xmath32 fluorite - type subcells,@xcite which is inaccessible for direct _ ab initio _ modeling because of the huge computational demands .",
    "we thus turn to the study of the @xmath33 structure , as well as other defective uo@xmath8 configurations as listed in table [ tab : cohee ] , and hope they can provide useful information on the general trend of oxidation effects on compression behavior . in @xmath33 configuration",
    "there is one oxygen interstitial occupying the largest octahedral hole @xmath34 , and has the same chemical composition as u@xmath30o@xmath31 .",
    "but one should keep in mind that it is more a defective uo@xmath0 rather than being u@xmath30o@xmath31 , and would overestimate the bulk modulus slightly because of its high symmetry .",
    "the 0k compression curves of defective uo@xmath8 are shown in fig.[fig : pv - c ] , together with that of uo , @xmath11-u@xmath9o@xmath10 , and @xmath12-uo@xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding parameters for these curves are listed in table [ tab : cohee ] .",
    "it can be seen that although there might be some structure - dependence , a general trend is evident . with an increase of the oxidation degree from uo to uo@xmath0 ,",
    "the compound becomes harder and harder to compress , with the @xmath33 configuration of uo@xmath8 being the stiffest one .",
    "further oxidization softens the material , and @xmath12-uo@xmath9 is the most compressible one .",
    "please note that @xmath11-u@xmath9o@xmath10 and @xmath12-uo@xmath9 transform into other structures under compression at a pressure scale of several gpa .",
    "this makes the @xmath35-@xmath36 lines kink at the transition points , and increase the compressibility further .",

    "note that the values of @xmath11-u are taken from experiments,@xcite and others are the calculated results as listed in table [ tab : cohee ] .",
    "we can see that stoichiometric uo@xmath0 has the largest cohesive energy per atom , thus being the most energetically stable phase , and reflects the fact that when heated to 1573k u@xmath9o@xmath10 decomposes to uo@xmath0 . as mentioned above ,",
    "uo@xmath0 , as well as uo@xmath8 , lies in the intermediate stage of the charge transfer process .",
    "therefore it has the strongest covalent bonds that arise from hybridization between u@xmath2 and o@xmath23 orbitals , which then give rise to the smallest atomic volume , the deepest cohesive energy , and the highest bulk modulus , and therefore the least compressibility of uo@xmath8 as shown in fig.[fig : pv - c ] .",
    "further oxidization to u@xmath9o@xmath10 shifts the material quickly into ionic character , and the covalent bonds become weak .",
    "this leads to a huge volume expansion of more than 30% , and is dangerous for most nuclear application purposes .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that in fig.[fig : pv - c ] the @xmath35-@xmath36 lines of uo@xmath8 span a wide range of pressure , and is comparable to the difference between stoichiometric uo@xmath0 and other oxides .",
    "this underlines the importance of an accurate non - stoichiometric eos , and it is inappropriate to _ represent _ it by any specific defective configuration , especially when the defect species change with temperature and pressure .",
    "therefore a full eos model is required for understanding the general thermophysical properties of off - stoichiometric compounds .",
    "that is , one has to study how the stoichiometry variation is accommodated in the material , what kind of microscopic entities are they in physics , and how these entities respond to different physical conditions . in the case of uo@xmath0 , it is well known that point defects as well as some oxygen clusters account for the stoichiometry variation while keeping the fluorite - type matrix almost unchanged .",
    "these features make the construction of the non - stoichiometric eos much easier .",
    "almost all of the earlier defect population analyses were carried out with 0k formation energies.@xcite it is widely assumed that the contribution from lattice vibrations is insignificant , but lacks detailed assessment .",
    "also local residual stress and thermal expansion effects were completely neglected .",
    "the following discussion is devoted to this issue , and reveals that thermal vibrations have a limited but important influence on defect populations , whereas the pressure effect is much more striking in comparison .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that since uo@xmath0 is a semiconductor , the defects can be charged.@xcite these charged species might have several charge states.@xcite these facts and the slow convergence of a charged system in computation complicate the discussion ( the energy converges linearly with respect to the inverse of the supercell size at the first order correction ) . since our main purpose here is to investigate the phonon contribution and the compression effects on defects behavior , which should be similar for neutral and charged defects ( we are reminded of the qualitative consistency of these two kinds of defects on 0k formation energy@xcite ) , we thus focus our discussion here on neutral defects only .",
    "extension of the analysis to charged defects is straightforward as long as the energetics of these species are known .       under compression at different temperatures .",

    "it can be seen that phonon contribution reduces the fge of the uranium frenkel pair ( fp ) , whereas it enhances that of the oxygen fp . as a result",
    ", its contribution to schottky defect almost completely disappears due to cancellation of the opposite effect on uranium and oxygen defects .",
    "the maximum difference of the fge between 0 and 1800k is less than 0.62ev for frenkel pairs and 0.12ev for schottky defect , respectively . in other words",
    ", it counts only about 11% for oxygen fp , 4% for uranium fp , and 1% for schottky defect .",
    "the calculated fge at 0gpa and 0k are consistent with that of ref .",
    "but we have to point out that there is a typo in ref .",
    "[ ] where the formation energy of the uranium point interstitial ( u - int . )",
    "should be 5.642ev instead of 8.194ev .",
    "this change affects table i and table iv in ref .",
    "[ ] . also , it reduces the energy of the uranium frenkel pair ( u - fp ) in table iv from 17.2 to 14.6ev .",
    "however , this does not affect the defect population analysis since the concentration of uranium interstitial is too small to have any significant contribution to the stoichiometry of uo@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , lattice vibrations decrease the fge of the cot-@xmath39 complex ( see fig.[fig : gf - coto ] ) .",
    "increasing the temperature from 0 to 1800k , the change in the fge of the cot-@xmath39 complex is less than 0.72ev , which is about 3% of the total formation energy .",
    "compression depresses the phonon effects slightly .",
    "but totally , the thermal vibrational contribution to the fge of point defects and the oxygen defect cluster is small .",
    "in contrast , the compression effect is quite prominent . within a pressure range of 30gpa , which is easy to achieve with diamond - anvil cell ( dac ) devices or micro shock - wave loadings in nuclear materials driven by thermal spikes or collision cascade events arisen from fission reactions ,",
    "the fge increases 1.07 , @xmath40 , and 4.02ev for uranium fp , oxygen fp , and schottky defects , and amounts to 7% , @xmath41% , and 38% of the zero pressure values , respectively . for the cot-@xmath39 complex ,",
    "the fge change is @xmath42ev , about @xmath43% of the 0gpa value .",

    "solid ( dotted and dashed ) line indicates the concentration in oxygen interstitial ( oxygen vacancy and uranium vacancy ) .",
    "the concentration of uranium interstitial is negligible.,width=3 ]    in addition to being a key content in the construction of a non - stoichiometric eos,@xcite the importance of analyzing defect populations , or equivalently the concentrations , also lies in the challenge of the elusive physics of uo@xmath1 .",
    "although experiments have shown that cot-@xmath39 clusters constitute the ordered phase of u@xmath30o@xmath31 on a fluorite matrix,@xcite it is still in debate whether or not such a cluster also appears in uo@xmath1.@xcite calculations using 0k formation energy suggested that the existence of cot-@xmath39 in uo@xmath1 is quite likely , but the observed ratio of oxygen interstitials occupying different sites can not be accounted for quantitatively.@xcite this implies that we can not exclude other possibilities . in this sense",
    "it is very important to figure out how the population of each possible defect changes with temperature and pressure . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned above , one of the gga+__u _ _ calculations predicted a positive 0k formation energy for point oxygen interstitial.@xcite if this reflects the true physical behavior , we can expect that phonon contribution at elevated temperatures should be as such that it makes oxygen defects the major component .",
    "these considerations underline the necessity to investigate the defect populations at different pressures and temperatures with phonon contributions having been taken into account .    using the point defect model ( pdm ) developed by lidiard and matzke,@xcite defect populations around the dilute limit",
    "can be computed .",
    "the key point is that here the fge instead of the 0k formation energies are employed . in the following",
    "we mainly discuss the hyperstoichiometric ( @xmath44 ) regime because in the other side of @xmath45 , it is always oxygen vacancy ( o@xmath46 ) that predominates . although both pressure and temperature enhance the concentration of point oxygen interstitial ( o@xmath4 ) and uranium interstitial ( u@xmath4 ) slightly , they are still at least two orders smaller than that of o@xmath46 and can be neglected safely .",
    "figure [ fig : pdm - conc ] illustrates the defect populations as a function of composition at 1700k under pressures of 0 and 10gpa , respectively . by comparing with fig.11 in ref .",
    "[ ] where only 0k and 0gpa formation energies were used in the pdm analysis , we find a slight decrease of the concentration of o@xmath4 and an increase of the uranium vacancy ( u@xmath46 ) , and the latter becomes the major component when @xmath47 .",
    "both lattice vibrations and thermal expansion contribute to this change . from fig.[fig : gf - pd ] we learn that phonon favors uranium defects . thermal expansion also prefers uranium fp and schottky defect because at an elevated temperature thermal expansion leads to a larger volume that corresponds to a negative cold pressure , which reduces the formation energy of uranium fp and schottky but lifts that of oxygen fp .",
    "this result is strongly against the experimental observation that oxygen defects are predominant in uo@xmath0 at any temperature and stoichiometry.@xcite increasing pressure can depress the uranium vacancy , as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : pdm - conc ] .",
    "this is easy to understand by inspecting the variation of fge with pressure as shown in fig.[fig : gf - pd ] . nevertheless , this compression effect is not enough to explain the observed predominance of oxygen defects because the possible residual stress within the fuel is usually less than 1gpa , and at such a pressure scale the uranium vacancy is still comparable to oxygen defects .     on defect concentrations at 0 and 10gpa , respectively .",
    "the dash - dotted line indicates the concentration of cot-@xmath39 cluster ; others are the same as in fig.[fig : pdm - conc].,width=3 ]    it thus becomes interesting to investigate whether phonon and compression effects can alter the behavior of the cot-@xmath39 cluster greatly or not .",
    "earlier studies showed that when only 0k formation energies were used , the cot-@xmath39 cluster is dominant at low temperature and high composition region.@xcite figure [ fig :",
    "ica ] plots the variation of defect populations at 1700k with cot-@xmath39 included . note here that we didnot consider the internal degeneracy of this cluster,@xcite since physically no two clusters can occupy the same lattice site simultaneously if we ignore quantum effects and treat oxygen as a classical particle .",
    "we can see that , as in the previous case , phonon contribution enhances uranium vacancy , which is very clear if comparing with fig.3 of ref .",
    "the earlier conclusion that cot-@xmath39 is predominant is still preserved when @xmath48 . at a pressure of 10gpa , uranium vacancy is drastically suppressed , leaving only single oxygen interstitial and cot-@xmath39 in competition ( the right panel of fig.[fig : ica ] ) .",
    "lowering the temperature to 700k further suppresses uranium vacancy and oxygen interstitial , as fig.[fig : ica-700k ] shows , meanwhile cot-@xmath39 gets some promotion . increasing the pressure to 10gpa",
    "then sweeps all other defects away and leaves only o@xmath4 and cot-@xmath39 clusters , with a slight depression of the latter and an enhancement of the former .",
    "it is evident that lattice vibrations and hydrostatic compression change the competition among defects greatly , and the conclusions obtained with 0k and 0gpa formation energies need be revised : when considering only point defects , the earlier predicted predominance of o@xmath4 doesnot hold anymore with the full fge , and u@xmath46 becomes the dominant defect when @xmath47 . that is to say , at the full level of the theory the experimental fact",
    "can not be reproduced if only neutral point defects are considered . on the other hand , when the cot-@xmath39 cluster is taken into account , the predominance of this oxygen cluster can be easily established both at the full fge level and at the 0k and 0gpa formation energy level .",
    "the calculated results clearly demonstrate that hydrostatic pressure has a strong influence on defect populations , and oxygen clusters are definitely necessary in order to suppress the concentration of uranium vacancy to match the experimental observation qualitatively .    considering the low temperature phase diagram@xcite of uo@xmath1 and the negative formation free energy of o@xmath4 and cot-@xmath39 ,",
    "it becomes clear that the possibility of phase separation between uo@xmath0 and u@xmath30o@xmath31 must be considered seriously if one wants to understand the underlying physics correctly . because u@xmath30o@xmath31 can be viewed as an ordered phase of cot-@xmath39 clusters on a fluorite matrix,@xcite",
    "this phase separation is in fact a process of formation and segregation of oxygen clusters .",
    "thus at the intermediate composition and elevated temperature range where uo@xmath1 is stable , the dynamics of decomposition / formation of cot-@xmath39 is crucial , as well as other competitive clusters such as ( @xmath36 - 3o@xmath49)@xmath0.@xcite it is worthwhile to highlight the connection between @xmath36 - 3o@xmath49 based clusters@xcite and cuboctahedral clusters@xcite ( mainly cot-@xmath39 ) .",
    "although the latter is more stable at low temperature,@xcite it was predicted that with increasing temperature cot-@xmath39 will gradually dissociate into a set of single point defects.@xcite the intermediate state of this process is of great importance for understanding the kinetic behavior . the relatively low energy of ( @xmath36 - 3o@xmath49)@xmath50 makes it a promising candidate of this transition state.@xcite this is possible because the cot cluster in fact can be viewed as a complex formed by eight tightly connected @xmath36 - 3o@xmath51 clusters ( a distorted version of @xmath36 - 3o@xmath49 ) .",
    "then partial dissociation of cot clusters will likely go through a configuration of @xmath36 - 3o@xmath49/o@xmath51 kinetically to lower the energy barrier ; that is , @xmath52     but now with a temperature of 700k.,width=3 ]      off - stoichiometry is widely observed in materials of many categories , for example , in ionic compounds ( _ e.g. _ , oxides , nitrides , and carbides ) , alloys and intermetallic compounds , doped semiconductors , and high - temperature superconductors , and so on . in these materials ,",
    "the underlying structure of the matrix is usually unchanged or just slightly distorted , but the electronic and magnetic properties can be controlled and tuned for application purposes .",
    "the maximal stoichiometry deviation indicates the capability of the matrix structure to tolerate distortions caused by doped elements or defects .",
    "the mechanical properties usually are determined by the matrix , but are also varied with respect to different chemical compositions .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of these materials across a wide range of temperature and pressure are of interest not only for fundamental physics and material science but also for engineering applications , in which eos is one of the most important contents .",
    "there is an elegant theory developed on ising models of lattice gases , namely , the cluster variation method ( cvm),@xcite which describes the phase diagram and eos of binary and pseudo - binary alloys very well.@xcite to generalize this method beyond the ternary system is difficult . for ionic compounds ,",
    "however , the stoichiometry usually is accommodated via defects , and is a multi - component system with the number of species greater than four .",
    "furthermore , not all of these defects sit on the lattice site of the matrix , which complicates the construction of the theory , and slows down the convergence even if a cvm - like theory could be constructed.@xcite from this point of view , a different route should be attempted for a practical _ ab initio _ eos model ( _ i.e. _ , without any empirical parameters ) of non - stoichiometric compounds .",
    "having known the defect concentrations , we can express the total gibbs free energy @xmath53 of a non - stoichiometric material at pressure @xmath35 and temperature @xmath54 as a function of the defect concentrations @xmath55 that accommodate the stoichiometry deviation . around the vicinity of the dilute limit , taylor expansion of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath55 reads@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gibbs free energy of the matrix ,",
    "@xmath58 is the contribution of single defects , and @xmath59 is the interaction strength between defects , and so on . at the first order approximation",
    "we can express the non - stoichiometric gibbs free energy by making use of specific defective structures as reference ; that is , @xmath60 here the superscript `` @xmath61 '' indicates the defective reference system , @xmath55 is the concentration of defect type @xmath62 , and the gibbs free energy difference is @xmath63 .",
    "obviously this linear approximation assumes that the interaction term between defects @xmath59 is insignificant , which is only true at the dilute limit .",
    "however , making use of reference states extends the applicability of this approximation greatly .",
    "it is evident from eq.([eq : gtot ] ) that @xmath53 is close to being exact when @xmath64 .",
    "nevertheless , within this linear approximation , the solubility of defects and spinodal decomposition of the system can not be correctly described , where the nonlinear terms in eq.([eq : gibbs ] ) are essential .    within this framework ,",
    "the system volume becomes @xmath65 and this gives the equation of state for a non - stoichiometric material .",

    "hugoniot is a set of locus of thermodynamic states that describe the response of a material to shock wave loadings .",
    "it is governed by the law of energy conservation across the discontinuous zone generated by shock waves , _",

    ", width=3 ]    taking the largest defective configurations as the reference structures ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath71 and cot-@xmath39 configurations as listed in table [ tab : cohee ] that are based on a @xmath72 supercell of fluorite cubes ) , the shock hugoniot of uo@xmath1 up to 70gpa were calculated and shown in fig.[fig : shock ] with @xmath73 , 0.1 , and 0.25 , respectively . note",
    "that since here all defects are defined on a fluorite cubic cell of uo@xmath0 , the gibbs free energy @xmath53 must be given with respect to the same cell .",
    "the initial condition of shock is at 0gpa and 500k . the highest shock temperature is less than 1200k , reflecting the high bulk modulus of the material and thus a weak energy accumulation of shock waves .",
    "although the cubic fluorite phase of uo@xmath0 transforms into orthorhombic @xmath74 at room temperature beyond 42gpa,@xcite the transition is rather sluggish and the fluorite phase persists up to 70gpa.@xcite this suggests the selected range of pressure in fig.[fig : shock ] is appropriate . beyond that pressure , we must reanalyze the geometry of defects and their occupation dynamics because the matrix has already been changed due to phase transition .    from fig.[fig :",
    "shock ] we can see that the hugoniot of uo@xmath1 is very similar to stoichiometric uo@xmath0 , with the whole curve shifting to the left and reducing the cell volume correspondingly with an increase of @xmath13 . this is reasonable because from the above analysis we learned that within this pressure and temperature range the cot-@xmath39 cluster is always predominant , and the defective structure with this cluster has a very similar 0k energy curve as that of uo@xmath0 ( see table [ tab : cohee ] ) .",
    "however , this is not always the case for non - stoichiometric compounds . along the shock wave loading path , pressure and temperature change from point to point because of energy accumulations .",
    "if species of the major defect component were changed due to this kind of thermodynamic condition variation , the atomic scale behavior of defects would then manifest itself on the hugoniot curve . in that case",
    "the non - stoichiometric eos would be a useful tool to study this phenomenon theoretically and thoroughly .",
    "we have presented calculations , using the lsda+__u _ _ exchange - correlation functional , of the high - temperature high - pressure properties of point defects in uo@xmath8 .",
    "the phonon contributions were taken into account via the debye model .",
    "the results showed that lattice vibrations enhance the population of uranium vacancy slightly , whereas hydrostatic compression changes the energetics of all defects and then their populations greatly . at ambient pressure , however , inclusion of phonon free energy and thermal expansion effect fails to reproduce the experimental observation that oxygen defects should be predominant at the @xmath44 regime , suggesting that the inclusion of defect clusters such as cot-@xmath39 is necessary .",
    "furthermore , both lattice vibrations and compression favor the cot-@xmath39 cluster , and its predominance in the hyper - stoichiometric regime gets reinforced as compared with the results obtained with 0k formation energies .    in order to understand the overall trend of oxidation effects , the 0k electronic structures and equations of state of uo , uo@xmath8 , @xmath11-u@xmath75o@xmath10 , and @xmath12-uo@xmath9 were investigated thoroughly , revealing the transition of the groundstate of uranium oxides from being metallic to mott insulator and then to charge - transfer insulator across the full oxidation degree .",
    "variations of cohesive energy , atomic volume , and stiffness of the oxides due to evolution of the chemical bonds from being metallic to covalent and then to ionic characteristics were well demonstrated .",
    "the necessity to develop an eos model for off - stoichiometric compounds was also highlighted by comparing the compression curves of defective uo@xmath8 with that of other uranium oxides . with the knowledge of defect populations within a wide range of pressure and temperature , a specific equation of state for non - stoichiometric compounds",
    "was constructed .",
    "the shock hugoniots of uo@xmath1 were then studied to illustrate the performance of this model .",
