    "recent attempts to measure the primordial @xmath0he abundance report accuracies better than @xmath3 ( izotov & thuan 1998 ; olive , steigman , & skillman 1997 ; peimbert , peimbert , & ruiz 2000 ) .",
    "such accurate measurements are useful for testing the consistency of big bang nucleosynthesis and also for estimating the mean baryon density , @xmath4 ( schramm & turner 1998 ) .",
    "the primordial @xmath0he mass fraction , @xmath5 , is often inferred from the emission lines of blue compact galaxies ( e.g. , peimbert & torres - peimbert 1974 ; pagel , terlevich , & melnick 1986 ) under the implicit assumption that it had the same initial value throughout the universe , including within underdense regions of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .    however , a net difference between the element abundances in overdense and underdense regions could arise if diffusion occurs during the gravitational collapse of massive objects .",
    "different atomic species , because of their different masses , will have different thermal speeds and will therefore experience different pressure forces per unit mass .",
    "consequently , different elements would not flow into an overdense region at the same rate ; instead , heavier elements would obtain higher relative abundances in galaxies than in voids .",
    "diffusion is generally moderated by a frictional force arising from inter - species collisions .",
    "these collisions are most frequent for an ionized gas ( spitzer 1956 ) in which the characteristic cross  section for ion - proton collisions , @xmath6 , is far greater than the collision cross ",

    "we therefore focus our attention on the period between cosmological recombination and reionization during which the igm was neutral ( loeb & barkana 2001 ) . during this stage",
    ", atomic collision cross sections may be small enough to allow some diffusion to occur .    in this paper",
    "we quantify the diffusion of @xmath0he , @xmath1li , and d relative to @xmath12h that occurs as a spherical , slightly overdense region begins to collapse .",
    "we assume a @xmath13cdm cosmology , characterized by densities relative to critical of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for matter , vacuum , and baryons ; a hubble constant of @xmath17 ; a @xmath0he primordial mass fraction of @xmath18 ; and primordial @xmath1li and d number densities relative to @xmath12h of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the effects of diffusion are most important where the gas pressure matters , namely around the comoving jeans length scale @xmath21 . for redshifts",

    "these are linearized equations which are strictly valid only as long as the overdensities remain small .",

    "we then use a press - schechter mass function to average the resulting deviations over all collapsed objects in the universe . in   [ sec : obs ] , we compare our model to recent measurements of @xmath0he abundances .",

    "we use the computer program recfast ( seager , sasselov , & scott 1999 ) to determine the free - electron fraction as a function of redshift",

    "finally we take into account the frictional term arising from inter - species collisions .",
    "physically , this force is non - zero only if two species have different bulk velocities ; thus , the force on one species due to a second species may be written as @xmath76 ( burgers 1969 ) .",
    "since the difference in bulk velocities is already linear in the perturbations , we only need to calculate the coefficient @xmath77 to zeroth order for the linearized equations of motion .",

    "we evaluate the integral in equation ( [ eq : collforce ] ) numerically and plot the results in figure  [ fig : xsect ] for each type of inter - species collision .",
    "quantum mechanics becomes more important as the temperature decreases but the correction is never greater than a factor of four . for brevity",

    "we have set @xmath139 following cosmological recombination .",
    "the final redshift is marked by the first of two possible events .",
    "our equations are applicable in the linear regime , so we must stop if the object becomes nonlinear . at a transition to nonlinearity , the density would be greatly enhanced which would result in the suppression of diffusion .",
    "therefore , we expect diffusion to be effective in the linear regime where our equations are valid .",
    "the second stopping condition relates to the reionization of the universe . at that time , large coulomb cross sections between charged particles are able to effectively halt diffusion . in conclusion , we consider the case where the object becomes nonlinear after reionization and adopt @xmath140 ( haiman & loeb 1998 , 1999a , b ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; chiu & ostriker 2000 ; gnedin 2000 ) as the stopping point of our diffusion calculation . since the collapsed fraction of the universe is small at @xmath141 ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) , most of the material within galaxies that form much later ( at @xmath142 ) was still in the linear regime at @xmath143 , where our diffusion calculation is adequate .",

    "all length scales have been measured in terms of @xmath144 , defined in equation ( [ eq : k_j ] ) .",

    "the jeans wavenumber therefore obtains the value @xmath148^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : kjnumber}\\ ] ] which is the value used in figure  [ fig : nplots ] .",
    "we see that the dark matter overdensity has evolved approximately proportionally to @xmath149 , as might have been expected since gravity is the only force applicable to dark matter . on large scales corresponding to @xmath150 ,",
    "the baryons follow the dark matter ; however , on small scales corresponding to @xmath151 , pressure forces prevent baryonic modes from collapsing .",
    "this leads to the slight decline in dark matter amplification near the jeans scale and the dramatic decline in the amplification of baryonic modes there . in the lower panel of figure 3",
    ", we see that the perturbations of the different baryonic species do not experience exactly the same amplification . at @xmath152 ,",
    "pressure is negligible for all species , and the modes of each are amplified . since hydrogen is the lightest species , it reaches its jeans scale at the lowest @xmath102 . thus , all of the @xmath153 become positive at approximately the same wavenumber .",
    "as @xmath102 increases , we begin to reach the jeans scales of the heavier species .",
    "then the growth of @xmath102-modes of this second species is also suppressed , and the @xmath153 approach zero as @xmath102 gets large .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : nplots ] indicates that the overall magnitude of diffusion is not solely determined by the jeans scale of a species , or else the effect would have been largest for @xmath1li .",
    "this is because of the frictional term which serves to suppress diffusion , which is proportional to the square of the radius of an atom and therefore the greatest suppression is associated with the largest atoms .",
    "the normalized overdensities in figure  [ fig : nplots ] were obtained by evolving 1025 @xmath102-modes , equally spaced between with @xmath154 . to obtain the physical overdensities , each mode must be multiplied by its normalization factor .",
    "the normalization factor depends on the object assembly radius @xmath108 , and is fairly rapidly varying compared to the normalized overdensities . to get an accurate determination of the physical overdensity , we interpolate the normalized overdensity so that we sample it at a rate larger than the frequency of the normalization factor .",
    "we then use equation ( [ eq : normdeldef ] ) to obtain the physical @xmath102-modes .",
    "one such sampling is shown in figure  [ fig : delmnine ] .",
    "the value of @xmath108 used for this plot corresponds to an enclosed mass of @xmath155 .",
    "the relative errors incurred in interpolation are typically @xmath156 , and seldom exceed @xmath157 with the 1025 initial points .",
    "the normalization factor is also proportional to the initial dark matter perturbation , @xmath107 , which we express in terms of the collapse redshift of the object ( @xmath158 ) through the approximate relation we take @xmath159 for the overdensity of collapse and , unless otherwise stated , @xmath160 for the redshift of collapse .",
    "such objects would be just on the fringe of nonlinearity at @xmath140 .",
    "since diffusion within all objects was shut off at @xmath147 , the effects of diffusion would be decreased for objects that collapsed later .",
    "next we quantify the extent to which element abundances in collapsed objects differ from their primordial values .",
    "abundances of @xmath0he are commonly reported in terms of the mass fraction , @xmath161 where we have neglected the contributions of all species but @xmath0he and @xmath12h to the mass of the universe .",
    "after linearizing this equation , we see that @xmath162 in contrast , the abundances of @xmath1li and d are typically reported in terms of their number densities relative to hydrogen . in this case , @xmath163    to see how the element abundances in collapsed objects differ , on average , from their primordial values , we average equations ( [ eq : ymdev])- ( [ eq : lidedev ] ) over the original sphere of comoving radius @xmath108 , @xmath164 after integrating , we see that @xmath165 we carry out this final integration numerically . as described in   [ sec : kmodes ] , we evolve 1025 @xmath102-modes between 0 and 100@xmath166 to get the @xmath153 ( where @xmath62 could denote any of @xmath0he , @xmath1li , d ) .",
    "we interpolate to get values for @xmath153 at a fixed number of points , and then multiply each point by its normalization .",
    "we then evaluate the integral in equation ( [ eq : mdelint ] ) with these points .",
    "then we repeat the procedure , but with twice as many interpolated points . if the two results differ by less than a fraction of @xmath167 , we stop and accept the result .",
    "figure  [ fig : meandev ] illustrates the dependence of these deviations on the size of the collapsed object . instead of measuring the size of the object by its assembly radius , @xmath108 , we instead measure it in terms of its mass defined by @xmath168 we see that the deviation from the primordial mean shrinks as the collapsed object increases in size approximately according to a power law with slope @xmath169 .",
    "a simple argument yields the same result : assuming that the collapsing region starts out with primordial abundances throughout its volume and that diffusion occurs through the boundary of the region , the deviations from primordial abundances should fall off like @xmath170 , or @xmath171 .",
    "now that element abundances for particular collapsed objects are known , we proceed by averaging these abundances over all objects in the universe that have collapsed by a particular redshift .",
    "this statistic is approximated by using a press - schechter mass function ; for @xmath0he , @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the number density of objects of mass @xmath174 that have collapsed at a given redshift and @xmath175 is the averaged @xmath0he mass fraction within an object of mass @xmath174 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : uniavg ] ) is also appropriate for the @xmath1li and d abundances if we replace @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",
    "note also that there is a minimum mass scale of galaxies in which star formation is possible that we denote by @xmath178 ( abel 1995 ; tegmark et  al .",
    "we use a code developed by eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) and barkana ( 2000 ) to calculate @xmath173 at a redshift of @xmath179 .",
    "the averaged abundances differ from primordial by the amounts shown in figure  [ fig : unimean ] .",
    "we also consider a collapse redshift of @xmath180 ; in this case figure  [ fig : unimean ] shows that the abundance deviations decrease somewhat .",
    "this is not only due to the resulting decrease in @xmath107 , but also due to the dependence of @xmath173 on collapse redshift . at higher @xmath28",
    ", @xmath173 tends to favor lower mass scales where the abundance deviations are larger ( figure  [ fig : meandev ] ) .",
    "the element abundances of collapsed objects can differ from primordial abundances in two ways .",
    "first , the abundances of an object could be uniformly different from the primordial values .",
    "this possibility was already discussed in the previous section .",
    "second , if the element abundances within an object vary greatly from point to point , differences from the primordial abundances may be observed because of the fluctuations .",
    "we consider this latter effect by computing the standard deviation of the abundances within a given object .",
    "the lowest - order formula for this quantity is @xmath181 for @xmath0he and @xmath182 for @xmath1li and d. we have already calculated the mean values of the abundances , so now we only need the mean squares .",
    "we proceed as above , but this time we obtain a double integral that must be evaluated numerically , @xmath183 the integration region is the first quadrant of the @xmath184 plane .",
    "since the integrand is symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath102 and @xmath185 , it is equal to the integral @xmath186    we carry out the integrations as with equation ( [ eq : mdelint ] ) and our results are plotted as a function of mass scale in figure  [ fig : sigplot ] .",
    "comparing figures  [ fig : meandev ] and  [ fig : sigplot ] , we see that the relative importance of abundance fluctuations depends on the mass of the object in question . on small mass scales , abundances differ from their primordial values by an approximately uniform amount ; but as the object size increases fluctuations from the mean are more likely to produce a difference from the primordial values .",
    "we also average the standard deviation over all collapsed objects in the universe .",
    "our prescription for this is identical to that given by equation ( [ eq : uniavg ] ) , with @xmath187 taking the place of @xmath175 .",
    "these results are plotted versus the minimum mass scale for galaxies in figure  [ fig : siguniavg ] . comparing this to figure  [ fig : unimean ]",
    ", we again see that the relative importance of fluctuations increases with increasing mass scale .",
    "though much recent work has focused on uncovering the primordial @xmath1li and d abundances ( e.g. , burles & tytler 1998a , b ; tytler et  al . 1999 ; webb et  al . 1997 ; ryan et  al .",
    "2000 ) , the @xmath0he abundance with a reported uncertainty of about @xmath188 , is still more accurately determined .",
    "however , even this accuracy is at least an order of magnitude coarser than the mean effect of diffusion for low - mass objects .",
    "but , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : calc ] the @xmath0he abundance is also expected to vary from point to point within an object . in this section",

    "not only do we expect an object of a particular mass to have a @xmath0he abundance differing from the primordial value as shown in figure  [ fig : meandev ] , but also we expect that different measurements of the single object would display an intrinsic scatter about this mean as shown in figure  [ fig : sigplot ] . therefore , we fit the data to the following model . if an object has metallicity @xmath193 , the probability that it will have a @xmath0he mass fraction @xmath176 is denoted @xmath194 .",
