    "the purpose of this paper is to revisit the problem of electroweak precision tests in strong electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) models .",
    "remember that ewsb scenarios can be roughly classified into models with or without a higgs boson , by which we mean one or more scalar particle with a significant coupling to @xmath6 , so that it plays a dominant role in unitarizing the longitudinal @xmath6 scattering .",
    "models with a higgs boson are often called _ weakly coupled _ , because they can be extrapolated up to energies @xmath7 ( @xmath8 gev is the ewsb scale ) .",
    "for example , for low energy susy models one can have @xmath9 , while for models of composite pseudo - goldstone higgs boson one typically expects @xmath10 @xcite .    on the other hand , _ strongly coupled _ models , in which @xmath11 , are usually assumed to give rise not to a higgs boson , but to a sequence of vector resonances @xmath12 with masses @xmath13 .",
    "as is well known , vector exchanges are also able to unitarize @xmath14 scattering @xcite .",
    "this unitarization remains imperfect , since unitarity violations are postponed to a scale which is only a few times higher than @xmath15 .",
    "still , this possibility is very interesting .",
    "the unitarization condition fixes the @xmath12 coupling to @xmath14 in terms of its mass , and gives rise to a predictive framework .",
    "in particular , the @xmath16 decay width can be calculated and is found relatively narrow ( @xmath17 relative to the higgs boson width for the same mass ) .    historically , the first strongly coupled ewsb model was technicolor @xcite . in technicolor ,",
    "ewsb sector originates from an asymptotically free gauge theory in the uv , with a rapid confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the ir , very much like in qcd .",
    "however , other types of uv dynamics may also lead to strong ewsb .",
    "one possibility is that the uv theory stays close to a strongly interacting conformal fixed point over a wide range of energies , losing any connection to the weakly coupled description in the deep uv ( if there was any ) @xcite . in this case , thinking in terms of gauge degrees of freedom may be misleading .",
    "one may try instead to use the language of conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "conformal language is also indispensable in the context of strong ewsb models in warped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the defining feature of strong ewsb models is thus the presence of strong interactions and composite resonances at @xmath18 , and not the nature of fundamental degrees of freedom out of which these resonances are built .",
    "it is then interesting to know if the electroweak precision observables can be computed in terms of resonance masses and couplings .",
    "this is the question that we attempt to answer here .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : brief ] with a brief reminder of the electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) formalism .    in section [ sec : vmd ] we introduce an effective lagrangian for the strong ewsb sector .",
    "in addition to the usual goldstones , it contains the spin-1 vector and axial resonances .",
    "they transform nonlinearly under the @xmath19 global symmetry , as is appropriate for the composite particles .",
    "their couplings are fixed by the assumption that the uv behavior of various amplitudes ( @xmath20 scattering , pion formfactor ) is improved by tree - level resonance exchanges .",
    "this framework , called vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , is experimentally known to work well in qcd @xcite , and we adopt it here .    in section [ sec : s ]",
    "we discuss the @xmath0 parameter . in sections",
    "[ sec : pt ] , [ sec : svmd ] we review the peskin - takeuchi dispersion relation and use it to compute @xmath0 in our model .",
    "most of the discussion here is not new .",
    "our explanation why the chiral log contribution is expected to be cutoff at @xmath21 in vmd models may be not without interest .    in section [ sec : uvtail ]",
    "we discuss the weinberg sum rules .",
    "we explain why the second sum rule can not be expected to converge in models of strong ewsb which resolve the flavor problem via large higgs anomalous dimension ( walking or conformal technicolor ) .",
    "this fact has been suspected before , but can now be shown rigorously , using recent results about the uv conformal structure of such models .    in section [ sec : t ]",
    "we discuss the @xmath1 parameter . in section [ sec : gold ]",
    "we justify the prescription relating @xmath1 to the pion wavefunction renormalization in the landau gauge . in section [ sec : tuv ] we address ( the absence of ) the uv sensitivity .",
    "we point out that custodial symmetry in the ir is not an automatic consequence of the uv fixed point custodial invariance : it could be broken by scalars which are singlets of @xmath22 but not of @xmath19 .",
    "demanding that all such dangerous scalars be irrelevant is an extra condition on viable conformal technicolor models .    in section [ sec : tvmd ]",
    "we proceed to compute the one - loop @xmath23 contribution to the @xmath1 parameter from goldstones and resonances , in our vmd model .",
    "our discussion here completes and generalizes that of ref .",
    "in particular , we consider the full list of cubic vector - axial - goldstone couplings relevant for this computation .",
    "two of these can be fixed by demanding that they regulate the formfactors of spin-1 resonances , thus reducing the uv sensitivity of @xmath1 from quadratic to logarithmic .",
    "the third coupling is a free parameter .    finally , in section [ sec : vs ] we present numerical results showing how our vmd model compares with the electroweak precision data , and identify preferred regions of the parameter space .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "appendices [ sec : eps13exp],[sec : piav],[sec : tbulky ] collect technical details related to the electroweak fit and to the @xmath1 parameter computation .",
    "corrections to the electroweak precision observables can occur via the weak boson self - energies ( _ oblique _ , or _ universal _ corrections ) , or in fermion - weak boson vertices . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned only with the oblique corrections . in general , the vertex corrections are more model - dependent , since they require a discussion of how fermions couple to the ewsb sector .",
    "sometimes large vertex corrections are invoked to improve the electroweak fit @xcite , but that s not the road we would like to explore here .",
    "rather , we would like to see if a satisfactory fit can be obtained in the absence of significant vertex corrections .",
    "let us call a ewsb model _",
    ", if all new particles / resonances have masses @xmath24 ( including the standard model higgs boson if it exists ) . in this paper we will be mostly dealing with such models .    in heavy ewsb models ,",
    "electroweak precision tests are convenient to perform in terms of the three @xmath25 parameters @xcite . on the one hand , the @xmath25 s",
    "are linearly related to the precision observables @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 by universal coefficients dependent only on @xmath29 , the sine of the weinberg angle .",
    "the latter observables describe genuine electroweak corrections beyond the running of @xmath30 . here",
    "we will need only @xmath31 , @xmath32 , determined experimentally as parameter does not deviate significantly from its sm value .",
    "this is justifiable in heavy ewsb models , where one expects @xmath33 .",
    "analogously , the variations of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 parameters , constrained by lep2 data @xcite , are also expected to be negligible in our models . ]",
    "( appendix  [ sec : eps13exp ] ) @xmath36 with @xmath37 correlation . on the other hand ,",
    "the same @xmath25 s can be computed in terms of the gauge boson self - energies @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the formfactors appearing in the gauge boson vacuum polarization amplitudes : @xmath40    the terms @xmath41 in ( [ eq : eps13 ] ) involve combinations of gauge boson self - energies which are higher order in the @xmath42 expansion .",
    "we will not need their precise form , which can be found in @xcite . in heavy models , @xmath41",
    "are dominated by @xmath43 loops and are not sensitive to heavy new particles .",
    "still , it is useful to remember about their presence in ( [ eq : eps13 ] ) . in particular",
    ", this helps to clarify issues related to the gauge invariance of @xmath44 .",
    "for the standard model ( sm ) , comparison of theory and experiment points to a relatively light higgs boson .",
    "this well known fact is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : e13sm ] . for a heavy higgs",
    ", the @xmath31 , @xmath32 have a logarithmic dependence on @xmath45 : @xmath46 up to @xmath47 corrections .",
    "these logarithms come from @xmath48 and @xmath49 , while @xmath50 go to a constant in the heavy higgs limit .",
    "the curve in fig .  [ fig : e13sm ] has been traced using the full one - loop formulas from @xcite ; the fact that it deviates from a straight line in the light higgs region shows that the asymptotic expressions ( [ eq : asympteps ] ) are not accurate there .",
    "for any other model , electroweak precision analysis is simplified by focussing on the deviations of @xmath44 from their values in the sm for a reference value of the higgs mass .",
    "these deviations are known as the @xmath1 and @xmath0 parameters , @xmath51 compared to the normalization of @xcite . ] : @xmath52 where the approximations are valid if the model is heavy and @xmath53 .    , as well as their dependence on the higgs mass in the sm ( @xmath54 gev ) .",
    "the top mass is set at the current central value @xmath55 gev . ]",
    "we assume as usual that the strong ewsb sector has a custodial @xmath19 global symmetry .",
    "the corresponding symmetry currents are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and we will also use their vector and axial combinations @xmath58 . for simplicity , we assume that the strong sector preserves parity , under which @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the sm gauge group partly gauges the global symmetry of the ewsb sector . in the standard convention , @xmath61 gauges @xmath62 , while @xmath63 gauges @xmath64 .",
    "finally , by assumption , the global symmetry of the ewsb sector is broken spontaneously to the diagonal subgroup @xmath65 .",
    "this triggers ewsb as it gives rise to three goldstone bosons @xmath66 , eventually eaten by the @xmath35 and @xmath67 . as a subgroup , can be also considered .",
    "such non - minimal models will contain extra ( pseudo)-goldstone bosons in addition to the longitudinal @xmath35 and @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , a light composite higgs boson can emerge as one of these pseudo - goldstones ; see @xcite for a recent discussion . ]    an effective low - energy description of this minimal ewsb sector is provided by the chiral lagrangian : @xmath68 where @xmath69{cc}\\frac{\\pi^{0}}{\\sqrt{2 } } & \\pi^{+}\\nonumber\\\\ \\pi^{- } & -\\frac{\\pi^{0}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array } \\right ]   ~,\\qquad t^{a}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{a},\\nonumber\\\\ &   d_{\\mu}u=\\partial_{\\mu}u - i\\hat{b}_{\\mu}u+iu\\hat{w}_{\\mu}~,\\qquad\\hat { w}_{\\mu}=gt^{a}w_{\\mu}^{a}~,\\qquad\\hat{b}_{\\mu}=g^{\\prime}t^{3}b_{\\mu}~ , \\label{def}\\ ] ] and @xmath70 denotes the trace of a @xmath71 matrix .",
    "the invariant kinetic and mass terms for the sm fermions and gauge boson are left understood . under @xmath72 , @xmath73",
    "the chiral lagrangian is applicable at energies below any resonances .",
    "such resonances can however be added to the model .",
    "for example , higgs boson @xmath74 can be introduced via @xcite @xmath75 the last term describes the @xmath76 coupling , crucial for the unitarization of @xmath77 ( or @xmath14 ) scattering .",
    "it also dominates the heavy higgs decay width : @xmath78    in this paper , we are interested in models of strong ewsb , which are usually not expected to contain higgs - like scalars . instead , they may contain heavy spin-1 resonances ( analogs of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 mesons in qcd ) . from qcd literature @xcite ,",
    "there are several known , equivalent methods to couple such resonances to the chiral lagrangian .    here",
    "we will use a description by means of antisymmetric tensors transforming in the adjoint representation of @xmath65 ( and nonlinearly under @xmath72 ) . using antisymmetric tensors",
    "is a matter of convenience : up to field redefinitions , addition of local terms , and appropriate matching conditions for the coupling constants , equivalent results could be obtained with other formalisms .",
    "however , the issue of convenience should not be underestimated .",
    "there are at least three reasons why the antisymmetric tensor formalism looks better than the alternatives @xcite :    * it allows a unified treatment of states of positive and negative parity .",
    "the @xmath81 states could be introduced as gauge fields of @xmath65 , in an approach known as  hidden local symmetry \" ; however there is no simple natural way to do the same for the axials . * if vector fields in the adjoint of @xmath65 are used instead of antisymmetric tensors , extra local terms have to be added to the lagrangian to soften the uv behavior of various formfactors . in the antisymmetric tensor formalism these terms",
    "are accounted for automatically , due to a local term in the propagator ( see below ) .",
    "* finally , using antisymmetric tensors avoids mixing of the spin-1 axial fields with the derivatives of the goldstones .",
    "one more reason will be mentioned in note [ note:4th ] ; see section [ sec : s ] below . for a fair comparison",
    ", we must admit that the `` hidden local symmetry '' formalism has an advantage in that it allows to reach a weak coupling limit",
    ". however , this advantage would not be decisive for us , since we will be dealing here with theories which are on the verge of becoming non - perturbative .",
    "we thus consider two sets of vector states of opposite parity , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , both transforming in the adjoint representation of @xmath65 : @xmath84 we will be mostly considering the minimal situation when there is just one prominent resonance of each type , but it s trivial to generalize to several @xmath12 s and @xmath85 s . to describe the transformation properties of these fields under the full @xmath86 , one introduces the little matrix @xmath87 @xcite via@xmath88 this matrix parametrizes the @xmath89 coset and transforms as@xmath90 where @xmath91 is uniquely determined by this equation .",
    "the general transformation of @xmath92 is then given by the same eq .",
    "( [ eq : rtr ] ) with @xmath74 so defined .",
    "for @xmath93 we have @xmath94 independent of @xmath87 , and we recover the linear @xmath65 transformation .",
    "this is the usual theory of nonlinear realizations @xcite .",
    "the kinetic lagrangian for heavy spin-1 fields has the form  @xcite @xmath95 where the covariant derivative @xmath96,\\qquad\\gamma_{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [   u^{\\dagger}(\\partial_{\\mu}-i\\hat{b}_{\\mu})u+u(\\partial_{\\mu}-i\\hat{w}_{\\mu})u^{\\dagger}\\right ]   , \\quad\\gamma_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}=-\\gamma_{\\mu } , \\ ] ] ensures that @xmath97 transforms as @xmath98 under the global @xmath72 and under the sm gauge group .",
    "we then have the following two - derivative @xmath72 and parity invariant lagrangian describing the couplings of spin-1 fields to the goldstones and sm gauge fields : @xmath99\\rangle+\\frac{f_v}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\langle v^{\\mu\\nu}(u\\hat{w}^{\\mu\\nu } u^{\\dagger}+u^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}^{\\mu\\nu}u)\\rangle+\\frac{f_a}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\langle a^{\\mu\\nu}(u\\hat{w}^{\\mu\\nu}u^{\\dagger}-u^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}^{\\mu\\nu}u)\\rangle~ , \\label{eq : lv}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 parameters @xmath101 have dimension of mass and by naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) we expect them to be @xmath102 .",
    "phenomenology taking into account tree - level exchanges of @xmath12 and @xmath85 resonances in the goldstone scattering amplitudes and in their coupling to the sm gauge fields is known as vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite .",

    "this term appears automatically when deriving the propagator from the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagr ] ) .",
    "its presence is important for ensuring the good uv behavior of the amplitude ( [ eq : app ] ) . when using the description by nonlinearly realized _",
    "vectors _ , the contact term is absent and the amplitude grows as @xmath106 .",
    "this growth should then be cancelled by adding a @xmath107 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] term to the lagrangian .",
    "when using the antisymmetric tensor description , as we are doing here , one assumes that there is no extra @xmath107 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] term with a significant coefficient , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) is a good approximation for the @xmath20 scattering amplitude up to energies @xmath108 .",
    "we now discuss consistency of eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) with elastic unitarity .",
    "as is well known , the first term in the amplitude ( pure chiral lagrangian contribution ) would violate unitarity in the @xmath109 partial wave at around 1.7 tev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110 term helps to postpone unitarity violation to higher energies .",
    "this _ partial unitarity restoration _ is most efficient for @xmath103 somewhat above the value g_v^=v/ , [ eq : gv ] canceling the linear growth in @xmath111 .",
    "( rather than unitarize it ) .",
    "this approach is interesting to explore in the context of composite higgs models , as in @xcite , where the amplitude grows more gently and there is no need to save it from violating unitarity right away . in higgsless models",
    "the amplitude growth is more abrupt and there seems to be little room for a more general definition . ]",
    "taking this mechanism at face value , unitarity of elastic @xmath20 scattering can be preserved up to as high as 6(10 ) tev for @xmath112 tev .",
    "eventually , unitarity is violated by the logarithmically growing terms in @xmath113 .",
    "however , even before this , opening of inelastic channels like @xmath114 has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "because of this , we will trust the amplitude ( [ eq : app ] ) and the resulting partial unitarity restoration at most up to @xmath108 .",
    "parameter @xmath103 also controls the width of the @xmath12 resonance : @xmath115 interestingly , for @xmath116 this width is an order of magnitude smaller than the higgs boson width for the same mass , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wh ] ) . in this respect , vectors seem to be more efficient ( albeit imperfect ) unitarizers than scalars @xcite .",

    "we may be emboldened to take this step because , applied in qcd , this method gives the @xmath119 coupling and @xmath79-photon mixing in pretty good agreement with experiment @xcite .",

    ". basically , this happens because the mass hierarchy between @xmath85 and @xmath12 is never sufficiently large for these terms to dominate .",
    "thus , the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is not realized in our framework , although our basic conclusion that the resonances can provide a positive @xmath267 is the same .    .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a generic low energy description of higgsless scenarios of strong ewsb .",
    "we considered one vector ( @xmath12 ) and one axial ( @xmath85 ) spin-1 resonance and assumed vector meson dominance , i.e.  that tree level exchanges of these resonances cure the uv behavior of various formfactors , of the current two point functions , and of the elastic @xmath268 scattering up to the cutoff @xmath269 .    by requiring unitarity up to this scale",
    ", we fixed the value of @xmath103 in terms of @xmath15 . assuming the good uv behavior of the pion formfactor allowed us then to fix @xmath117 in terms of @xmath103 .",
    "the first weinberg sum rule gave then the coupling @xmath235 .",
    "anticipating the usual conflict of qcd - like scenarios with the ewpt , we assumed that the second weinberg sum rule is not satisfied , leaving the masses unconstrained .",
    "this is also to be expected if the uv structure of the model is of conformal technicolor type .",
    "we then computed the electroweak precision observables , using the peskin - takeuchi dispersive relation for the @xmath0 and a feynman diagram approach for the @xmath1 .",
    "we saw that the @xmath1 parameter features quadratic divergences , and used the mechanism proposed in @xcite to cancel them , introducing two new cubic @xmath264 couplings .",
    "these quadratic divergences then leave a physical effect , as the finite terms remaining after the cancellation contain a piece of the same structure but with the cutoff replaced by @xmath243 or @xmath15 .",
    "it was assumed in @xcite that , for this reason , keeping only those terms may be a good approximation .",
    "however , in our more restrictive framework this is not the case , since the allowed region for @xmath243 and @xmath15 does not allow large mass hierarchies .    on top of the operators of @xcite",
    ", we found a third cubic @xmath264 operator also contributing to the @xmath1 parameter , albeit only logarithmically .",
    "unfortunately we were not able to predict the corresponding coupling @xmath265 , and used an order - of - magnitude estimates to see its influence on the numerical result . despite this little drawback ,",
    "this operator turns out to be very interesting for comparison with the data .",
    "indeed , without it , consistency with the ewpt is possible only in a tiny corner of the parameter space where our formula for the @xmath1 begins to be less accurate ( for @xmath270 tev and @xmath271 gev ) .",
    "however , for negative values of @xmath265 we can get a good fit , with values of @xmath243 less close to the electroweak scale .",
    "the main conclusion is thus the same as of @xcite : that this kind of strong ewsb scenarios can be made compatible with the ewpt using the positive @xmath267 from resonances .",
    "however , the inner workings of how we achieve the consistency are different .    we are sharply aware of the fact that to arrive at this conclusion we had to make a number of simplifying assumptions whose accuracy may be difficult to assess",
    ". first , we assumed that the one - loop approximation for the @xmath1 parameter is accurate or at least gives an idea of the expected size of the effect .",
    "second , to reduce the number of parameters and to obtain a predictive framework , we assumed that just one generation of resonances ( one vector and one axial ) is important for saturating the various vmd sum rules .",
    "we hope that the noble goal of exploring the difficult world of strongly coupled models partly justifies our choice of imperfect means , for lack of better ones .    * note added .",
    "* one month after this work was posted to arxiv , the lhc experiments announced first evidence for a higgs - boson - like particle near 125 gev .",
    "while the working assumption of our work was that a higgs boson does not exist , some of the lessons that we learned here will be also useful for computing electroweak precision observables in composite higgs models , and in particular for putting on more solid grounds the estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath0 made in ref .",
