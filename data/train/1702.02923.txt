    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration poses a very fundamental question to theoretical cosmology : does acceleration reflect the existence of new fields in high energy physics or the need for modifications of the standard gravity theory on cosmological scales ?",
    "this question becomes even more complicated as it is possible to construct modified gravity ( mg ) scenarios that produce the same cosmic expansion of general relativistic dark energy ( de ) models  @xcite .",
    "such degeneracy lies in the background level , where the description of the universe is made from a perfectly symmetric and simplified model .",
    "therefore , the use of cosmological observables , such as the hubble parameter or the luminosity or angular diameter distances , does not seem to be enough to determine if the cosmic acceleration is a geometrical or a dynamical effect .",
    "when a more realistic scenario is considered , in which the universe has geometrical and energy fluctuations , it is possible to describe the growth and evolution of overdensity and underdensity regions . since different classes of models produce , in general , characteristic predictions of the growth of the cosmic structures , perturbative quantities , such as the growth rate ( @xmath6 ) and index ( @xmath7 ) , are believed to be important tools to distinguish mg from de models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    from the theoretical side , some null tests have been proposed to probe the validity of the standard cosmology @xcite . in these tests , the relation between different observables must be set at specific values , otherwise , there would be a violation of one or more assumptions used to derive the test .",
    "in refs . @xcite it was presented a new null test involving both measurements of cosmic expansion and matter perturbations .",
    "for the arguments mentioned earlier , it is expected that such null tests involving perturbative observables will be more efficient than others using only background quantities .    on the other hand , to obtain information about the functional behaviour of dynamical and kinematical variables , parametric and non - parametric methods have been used . in both cases ,",
    "the final reconstructed quantity is constrained by observational data . in parametric approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , a prior functional form is used to describe the observations , whereas in the non - parametric approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is commonly assumed a correlation between each data point .    in this work ,",
    "we apply a non - parametric smoothing ( nps ) method @xcite to reconstruct the evolution of matter perturbations from background data , such as the measurements of the cosmic expansion rate @xmath0 .",
    "we apply the method to a sample of @xmath0 data from cosmic chronometers  @xcite , lying in the redshift @xmath8 , and high-@xmath1 quasar data at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the cosmic chronometer data have been obtained from the differential age method for passively evolving galaxies of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is aimed to be cosmological and stellar population synthesis model - independent @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "current measurements of the expansion rate from quasar data have been obtained using the three - dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the ly@xmath10-forest of high-@xmath1 quasars , as reported in ref .",
    "in particular , the application of this latter technique to a sample of 48,640 quasars provided a measurement of @xmath0 within @xmath11 accuracy at @xmath12 , which imposes tight bounds on cosmological parameters when combined with current @xmath13 measurements and other cosmological data sets ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent analysis ) .",
    "we follow the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) to reconstruct perturbative quantities from background observables and compare them with current measurements of growth rate and index .",

    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec [ mpe ] we summarise the treatment of linear matter perturbations of ref .",

    "we present the results of our reconstructed cosmic expansion , the matter perturbation analysis and the calculation of the null test in sec .",
    "we end this paper with the main conclusions in sec .",
    "in the longitudinal gauge , the scalar perturbations of a flat flrw metric are characterised by the line element @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the gauge invariant potential and curvature perturbation , respectively .",
    "when we consider scales inside the hubble sphere , the matter density contrast , @xmath17 and the scalar modes satisfy the poisson equation and @xmath16 are equal if there is not anisotropic stress in the universe components . ]",
    "@xmath18 we consider a universe composed of matter and an unclustered de fluid separately conserved . under these assumptions ,",
    "the evolution of the matter density contrast is given by  @xcite @xmath19 where the dot denotes derivative with respect to cosmic time .",

    "note that the integral solution of the matter density contrast is not coupled with its first derivative .",
    "conversely , to solve @xmath25 we need to know the behaviour of the density contrast .",
    "the only prior information required to solve eqs ( [ 2ode ] ) and ( [ 22odes ] ) is the value of the density parameter @xmath2 . in this work ,",
    "we use realistic values of the density parameter provided by current cmb experiments . to obtain a unique solution for the second order differential equation ( [ 2ode ] )",
    ", we need to fix the two integration constants . in the solution ( [ 22odes ] ) these constants are the values of the matter density contrast and its first derivative at the present time .",
    "@xmath26 is fixed by the normalisation of ( [ 22odes ] ) at @xmath24 whereas the second constant , @xmath27 , can be fixed analysing the behaviour of the solution at very high redshift , where it is expected that @xmath28 . for this purpose , it is easier to analyse another relevant perturbative quantity , the so - called growth factor , defined by @xcite @xmath29 with this definition , we can fix the @xmath30 when the growth factor reaches a constant behaviour at high @xmath1 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the integral solution ( [ 22odes ] ) of @xmath31 involves only information about the matter density parameter at the current epoch and the normalized expansion rate ( @xmath32 ) , which is contained in the dimensionless physical distance .",
    "prior knowledge of these two quantities and of @xmath32 determine univocally the matter density contrast @xcite .",
    "we can define the growth rate of the linear density contrast as @xmath33 and the rate of change of the amplitude of clustering , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in terms of @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath37 is the present linear mass dispersion on a sphere of radius @xmath38mpc .",

    "( [ 2ode ] ) , ( [ fdef ] ) and ( [ fs8def ] ) along with the reconstruction of the hubble parameter are independent .",
    "a tension between these independent estimates would be a clear evidence of non - standard cosmology or a violation of the assumptions used to derive eq.([2ode ] ) .",
    "for instance :    * the universe is not flat , homogeneous and isotropic in large scales . for instance , in a non - flat universe the poisson equation has to be modified , as shown in ref .",
    "the de and matter components are not separately conserved and the matter density does not decrease proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "examples of this kind are models with decaying of dark energy into dark matter or vice versa @xcite . *",
    "the correct theory of gravity is not the gr or the de fluid is clustering . in both cases , @xmath41 is no longer a constant and can be written as an effective gravitational function which depends on the scale and time @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this topic .",
    "finally , we define the growth index , which we write as a function of @xmath1 as  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 the main importance of the growth index is that it constitutes a powerful tool to characterize gravity theories . for instance",

    "@xcite the growth index is constrained to the interval @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to construct a null test for gr from matter density perturbations using the equations that govern their evolution .",
    "for this reason , the hypotheses used so that eq.([2ode ] ) correctly describes the evolution of @xmath36 must be satisfied .",
    "the null test is constructed as follows  @xcite .",
    "first , let us assume that eq.([2ode ] ) results from the euler - lagrange equations with @xmath31 as generalised coordinate , i.e. , @xmath51 in this case , we can associate the follows lagrangian @xmath52 and hamiltonian @xmath53 to the system :    @xmath54    @xmath55    in this system , the hamiltonian depends explicitly on the time parameter @xmath56 which implies that @xmath53 is not a constant of motion. finding a symmetry direction of the system , we construct the first integral of motion , @xmath57 this normalized quantity constitutes a null test of gr involving a perturbative variable .",

    "measurements of the expansion rate are important observational probes of the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the cosmic chronometer approach is developed using the differential ages of massive and passively evolving old elliptical galaxies  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other observables that depend on integrated quantities along the line of sight , cosmic chronometers estimates are independent of the spatial geometry of the universe .",
    "the cosmic expansion corresponds to the estimate of the age change of the universe for a given variation of the redshift .",
    "this information can be obtained by the analysis of the galaxy ages with their respective @xmath1 .",

    "one of the main feature of cosmic chronometer approach lies in the fact that their estimates are cosmological model - independent , although there can be dependence on stellar population synthesis models at high redshift . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , this latter dependence does not appear until @xmath66 .",
