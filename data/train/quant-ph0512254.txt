    "both space and time are parameters used to mathematically describe observable properties of physical objects or systems of objects . in some ways space and time are similar , both intuitively and mathematically , since they are the most basic coordinates used to describe the dynamics of physical systems .",
    "it is often convenient and conventional to use @xmath1 and @xmath2 to specify when and where an object is , even in quantum systems where the precision ( or locality ) of these coordinates is limited by the uncertainty principle or obscured by entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , space and time differ fundamentally ( even neglecting the second law of thermodynamics , which defines a direction in time but no preferred direction or arrow in space ) .",
    "because there is no counterpart of temporal causality in a space - like context , an object can repeatedly return to any spatial location , but it can not return or jump ahead temporarily in time .",
    "much has been written about spatial properties of multi - particle systems , but less about time , even though three - dimensional space would seem much harder to deal with than one - dimensional time .",
    "time , unlike space , seems somehow enigmatic .",
    "newton refers to time as  like a river flowing .",
    "\" einstein calls time  that which a clock measures . \" and feynman refers to time as the space between events , i.e. that which keeps everythingfromhappeningallatonce .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to see what happens when we try to carry an idea formulated in a spatial context into a time context .",
    "that idea is correlation ( associated with non - randomness , or quantum entanglement ) .",
    "time correlation  @xcite has been directly related to time ordering , a causality condition implied by the time - dependent schrdinger equation that constrains sequential interactions to occur in order of increasing time .",
    "it is well known that the n - body problem , namely determining the quantum evolution of @xmath3 correlated or interacting bodies , is exponentially difficult .",
    "kohn  @xcite specifically estimates that the amount of computer storage capacity needed to solve an n - body problem scales as @xmath4 , where 3 is simply a coefficient based on experience . combining kohn s estimate with moore s law , which estimates , again based on experience , a doubling of computer capacity every 1.5 years",
    ", one can easily show that 6.5 years are required for computer capacity to grow enough to accommodate one additional body .",
    "thus , increasing capacity from , say helium ( n = 3 ignoring nuclear and subnuclear structure ) to carbon ( n = 7 ) is estimated to require about 25 years , progressing to water ( n = 11 ignoring the inner shell ) requires about 50 years , and dna thousands of times the age of the universe .",
    "the n - body problem is difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "since much of physics , chemistry , biology , materials science , nanotechnology , and quantum computing involves multiple particles , the problem is significant . in quantum computing , for example , much has been understood about individual qubits ( regarded here as single  bodies \" ) , but much less is understood about the coupled networks of qubits needed to build a quantum computer .",
    "evidently , there is a need for sensible , well - defined approximations to the n - body problem .",
    "perhaps the most widely used of these is the independent particle approximation ( ipa ) , where the n - body problem is dramatically reduced in complexity to a problem of n independent bodies ( or particles , quasi - particles , qubits ,  ) .",
    "it is sometimes argued that a theory is not well defined until a reliable method is developed to calculate corrections to the theory . in the case of the ipa ,",
    "the corrections are called correlations and represent interconnections among the positions of the various particles .",
    "correlation implies complexity : a system of independent ( i.e. uncorrelated ) particles is less complex than a system in which each particle s behavior depends on the behavior of every other particle . from one viewpoint ,",
    "correlation is a key to understanding how to make complex systems from simple ones . from the opposite point of view , in a very complicated system correlation can be a pathway to see order through a landscape of chaos .",
    "our approach is to focus on the first viewpoint  building complex systems from simple ones . if the correlations are sufficiently small , then the ipa is reasonably accurate .",
    "correlation , one method to approach the n - body problem , is defined as the difference between a full solution and the ipa .",
    "thus , the ipa limit of no correlation is used to define correlation itself . while this approach appears a bit awkward at first , it is conventional in the study of non - random processes and quantum entanglement as well .",
    "for example , in the limit of no entanglement the n - body wave function may be written as a simple product of independent particle solutions , and entanglement may be defined as the deviation from this limit .    in most applications , correlations arise from spatial interactions between particles . in n - electron atoms , for example , electron correlation is generated by the @xmath5 coulomb interactions between electrons . in this context , the ipa is also known as the independent electron approximation ( iea ) and is defined by replacing these complicating correlation interactions by a sum of single - electron mean - field interactions . the resulting hamiltonian is a sum of single - electron terms , even in the case of dynamic atomic systems  @xcite , and the resulting wave function is a product of single - electron wave functions .",
    "one common method for analyzing deviations from the iea is many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) , used here and in other fields as well to describe correlation at various orders in a given perturbation .",
    "one of the primary questions motivating the work described here is ,  what happens if one tries to define an independent time approximation ( ita ) , where one eliminates correlations in time rather than the conventional correlations in space ? \" in such an approximation , multiple times may be used for multiple particles  @xcite .",
    "this is simpler than using a single time for all particles , just as the use of n independent particle positions is simpler that trying to solve a single , but complicated , n - body problem .",
    "time correlation may then be defined as a deviation from the ita in analogy to the definition of spatial correlation by reference to the ipa .      in this paper",
    "we first review early efforts to define the ita , in which a key step is to remove time ordering between fields acting on different particles .",
    "this is closely related to the approximation of no time ordering ( nto ) , where all time ordering is removed for fields acting either on different particles or on the same particle .",
    "these early efforts to define and study the ita were based on a perturbation expansion of the external interaction @xmath0 . since time correlation or time ordering first",
    "appear at second order in @xmath0 , the observable effects are small and the calculations difficult .",
    "next we review more recent investigations of time ordering and the nto approximation for qubits in non - perturbative external fields .",
    "therefore , the organization of this paper is unusual .",
    "the harder problem of time correlation is addressed first , and the related but more tractable problem of time ordering is discussed second .",
    "we follow this unusual order because it reflects what has happened in recent years and also because the newer work on time ordering raises some intriguing questions and challenges .",
    "in particular we emphasize that experimental evidence for time correlation has not yet been distinguished from evidence for time ordering .",
    "that is , no difference between the ita and the nto approximations has yet been observed in any experiment , although recent experiments have been progressing in this direction , as we illustrate below .",
    "in this section we consider solutions to the n - body problem described by a hamiltonian @xmath6 where there may be many terms in both the unperturbed @xmath7 , which we assume to be solvable , and in @xmath8 , which we regard as an external time - dependent interaction ( written in the schrdinger representation ) .",
    "where appropriate , @xmath8 may be treated as a classical external field . in the case of atomic collisions , this corresponds to the widely used semiclassical approximation ( sca ) where the projectile is regarded as a classical particle if it is a proton or electron and a classical wave if it is a photon .",
    "the n - body problem may be solved in various representations , depending on how @xmath9 is separated into @xmath7 and @xmath10 , ranging from the schrdinger representation where effectively @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the heisenberg representation where @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the sca",
    ", singularities can occur  @xcite in the first order amplitudes when the schrdinger representation is used . except where otherwise specified we shall use an appropriate intermediate representation that takes maximum advantage of known solutions for @xmath7 , and in which @xmath15 causes transitions between eigenstates of @xmath7 .",
    "we work in atomic units , in which @xmath16 .",
    "we seek solutions @xmath17 to the n - body problem described by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "it is both conventional and sensible to separate the influence of the external interaction @xmath18 from the initial state at some time @xmath19 before the external fields are applied to the atomic system , namely , @xmath20 here all dynamics are contained in the time evolution operator ( or green s function ) @xmath21 .",
    "it is easily shown that in the intermediate representation @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 the solution for @xmath21 , which may be verified by insertion into eq .",

    "the time ordering operator is central to the discussion in this paper , as it relates both to observable time ordering effects and to time correlation .",
    "the key idea is that @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 otherwise . _",
    "the no time ordering ( nto ) approximation is the approximation in which @xmath29 , and the constraint of time ordering is not enforced . _ in this limit all time sequences of the @xmath25 are equally weighted , so that @xmath30 in eq .  ( [ u ] ) .",
    "as noted above , the n - body problem is notoriously difficult to solve .",
    "a particularly useful approximation is the independent particle approximation ( ipa ) . for an atom with n electrons , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the nuclear charge and @xmath33 are the electron positions in a coordinate system centered on the nucleus , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the charge and position of the projectile .",
    "if @xmath37 is approximated by a mean field @xmath38 , then @xmath39 is reduced to a sum of single - particle terms that may be solved using separation of variables .",
    "one obtains the independent particle approximation ( ipa ) to the exact n - particle wave function , namely , @xmath40 where each @xmath41 is a single - particle wave function .",
    "we note here that in the ipa approximation , different times may be used for different particles , if so desired , since the particles are independent in both space and time .",
    "whatever happens to one of the particles does not influence what happens to any of the others , although time ordering is retained within the evolution of each independent particle .      in order to address the question ,  what happens if one tries to define an independent time approximation ( ita ) , where one explores correlations in time rather than the conventional correlations in space ? \" , a list of comparisons between the ita and ipa was developed  @xcite .",
    "an updated comparison is summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "time and space correlation can each be defined as a deviation from an uncorrelated limit , where the uncorrelated limit is given by a product form . electron identity , which has been ignored here for simplicity of presentation , may be restored by antisymmetrizing the uncorrelated single - electron wave functions .",
    "the uncorrelated limit may also be described by an average of the appropriate correlation operator , as indicated in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "correlation may then be defined in terms of fluctuations away from the average , as is done in statistical mechanics  @xcite . in both the spatial and temporal cases ,",
    "the average term may form the basis for useful approximate calculations .",
    "there are also notable differences  @xcite between temporal and spacial correlation , as detailed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "while correlation in space arises in the asymptotic target hamiltonian @xmath7 , and affects both the asymptotic initial wave function @xmath55 and the evolution operator @xmath21 , correlation in time occurs only in the time evolution operator @xmath21 .",
    "correlation in space comes from @xmath5 inter - electron interactions within the target . in the ipa , phase coherence and time correlation between electrons",
    "are both lost , as seen , for example , by noting that matrix elements of @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) may be complex and that the time order is significant except when all the @xmath56 go to a common @xmath57 .",
    "time correlation arises from time ordering of the external interaction @xmath18 acting on different particles .",
    "the ita is intimately related to the nto since @xmath58 in both cases . however , in the ita @xmath59 is applied only to the cross terms affecting different particles , while time ordering for each individual particle is retained . in the ita , each particle evolves independently in time , although the initial state may be spatially correlated .",
    "thus , the initial state @xmath60 evolves to @xmath61 , where the state of each particle may be evolved using its own independent time @xmath62 . removing some or all of the time ordering terms is straightforward in practice since the @xmath63 terms are easily identified , at least at second order in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "in this section we review time ordering and time correlation using perturbation theory for the interaction of charged particles with helium  @xcite . from eq .  ( [ u ] ) we see that the leading effect due to time ordering arises at second order in the @xmath43 expansion . thus the system has an infinite number of states but the external interaction @xmath18 only acts on the system twice . in sec .",
    "[ secqubits ] , we consider a strongly perturbed qubit , a two - state system that interacts with the external field @xmath18 an infinite number of times .    through second order in @xmath18 , the time evolution operator @xmath64",
    "is given by @xmath65 this may also be obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ deu ] ) through second order .",
    "note that as @xmath29 the order in which the interactions act may be interchanged .",
    "it is the difference between the limit as @xmath29 and the full result that defines the effects of time ordering . in the case of weak correlation considered here , the nto limit of @xmath29",
    "will coincidentally yield the ita as well .",
    "the trick now is to separate @xmath24 from @xmath66 .        to separate the time ordering effects from the non - time ordering ( nto ) effects",
    ", it is useful to write , @xmath67 where @xmath68 yields the nto approximation and @xmath69 yields the effects of time ordering .",
    "this decomposition of @xmath24 into an average part plus fluctuations is central for this paper .",
    "note that @xmath70 is required to satisfy the initial condition @xmath71 .",

    "time ordering is enforced among all potentials acting on an individual particle ( e.g. for @xmath72 at second order ) , but ignored for different particles in cross terms such as @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "this distinguishes the ita from the nto approximation where time ordering is removed for all terms .",

    "a third pathway to the ita is through elimination of off - energy - shell effects .",

    "( [ ftthetafun ] ) , it is the principal value term that carries the effects of time ordering . ignoring the off - shell contribution ( which is conveniently @xmath90 out of phase with the time - averaged term ) whenever the fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 act on different particles yields the ita .",

    "( [ u ] ) is replaced by @xmath96 .",
    "the replacement of the external time - dependent interaction by its time average is analogous to the replacement of the true inter - particle interaction by its mean - field value in the ipa , which involves averaging over the positions of all but one of the particles .",
    "we note that the limit of constant potential @xmath18 in which the nto approximation becomes exact is distinct from the adiabatic limit , in which the potential merely changes slowly with time .",
    "furthermore , the content of the nto or ita approximation depends on the representation used , as we will see explicitly in sec .",

    "@xmath101 .",
    "the difference between the ita and nto approximations is that in the second item above , the commutator disappears for all terms in the nto but only for the cross terms in the ita .",
    "a variety of second - order calculations with and without time ordering have been done by godunov and collaborators in recent years  @xcite .",
    "most of these calculations have studied two - electron transitions in atoms caused by high - velocity collisions with protons or electrons , where second born methods are applicable .",
    "the advantage of looking at two - electron transitions is that second order terms are often dominant , since both elastic scattering and single - electron transitions , corresponding to the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) , are experimentally eliminated .",
    "a disadvantage is that the resulting cross sections are quite small .",
    "the godunov code is remarkable in that the off - shell terms can be computed exactly at second order in perturbation theory , in contrast with most other existing calculations , which use closure approximations to avoid this relatively difficult calculation .",
    "dropping the difficult but interesting off - shell terms yields a result without any time ordering .",
    "comparing results with and without inclusion of off - shell terms then yields the time ordering or time correlation effect .",
    "the algebra required for the off - shell terms is relatively tedious , as reflected by the off - shell calculation typically requiring several hundred times more computer time .",
    "thus the nto ( and possibly the ita ) represents a substantial reduction of computer time and algebraic effort .",
    "when valid , this approximation can therefore be used to attack problems harder than those that require the full off - shell terms . unfortunately , at this point no simple , physically transparent criterion is known to us that determine when the nto or ita approximation is valid .",
    "there have been ten or so experiments that show some evidence for time ordering and time correlation effects for two - electron transitions in high velocity collisions .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic evidence is the factor of two difference found  @xcite in the double ionization of helium in collisions with protons and antiprotons at several mev .",
    "there seems to be agreement that this difference is due to time ordering and time correlation , but no definitive theoretical studies have yet been done .",
    "some studies  @xcite of auger profiles also support the need for time correlation and time ordering .",
    "the clearest direct comparison of experimental data with time - ordered and non - time - ordered theoretical calculations is for polarization of light emitted after excitation - ionization of helium by proton impact  @xcite .        in this study ,",
    "time ordering or time correlation has a @xmath102 effect on the predicted polarization .",
    "the experiment , with @xmath103 errors , is in excellent agreement with godunov s calculations , except at the lowest energy where perturbation theory is expected to break down , and clearly shows the importance of time ordering or time correlation effects .",
    "there is a need for more calculations by different authors to confirm these effects of time correlation and time ordering .    in all of these two - electron transition experiments ,",
    "one may do a simultaneous expansion in the external interaction @xmath18 and the correlation interaction @xmath104 .",
    "time correlation effects are associated with commutators of the form @xmath79 $ ] , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 label two different electrons , and are second order in @xmath107 .",
    "in addition , there are time ordering effects not related to time correlation : these are associated with commutators @xmath78 $ ] and enter at second order in @xmath107 and first order in @xmath104 ( since the commutator vanishes for @xmath108 ) .",
    "thus the difference between time ordering and time correlation is a third order effect , smaller by at least a factor of 10 than either the time ordering effect or the time correlation effect taken individually .",
    "the experiments show direct evidence for time correlation but do not distinguish between time correlation and time ordering .",
    "there is also one clear and definitive study by the group of thomas  @xcite that shows direct evidence for time ordering in atoms interacting with a time - varying magnetic field .",
    "a qubit is a very simple two - state ( e.g. on and off ) quantum system whose state population may be changed by an external potential @xmath43 , in analogy with the way in which an atomic state may be changed by the coulomb potential @xmath18 of the projectile in an atomic collision .",
    "qubits are building blocks for the complex interconnected n - qubit systems that can be used for quantum computation and quantum information .",

    "triple kicks are also straightforward to solve analytically .      in this subsection",
    "we use our analytic expressions to examine the effect of the dyson time ordering operator @xmath24 in a kicked two - state system .",
    "time ordering has been considered previously in the context of atomic collisions with charged particles  @xcite and differs somewhat from the order in which external pulses are applied , as illustrated below .",
    "as is intuitively evident , there is no time ordering in a singly kicked qubit  @xcite since there is only one kick .",
    "the simplest kicked two - state system that shows an effect due to time ordering is the qubit kicked by two equal and opposite pulses labeled @xmath159 and @xmath160 separated by a time interval @xmath152 .",
    "the evolution matrix for this system is  @xcite , @xmath161 the time evolution operator @xmath162 in the limit of no time ordering , i.e. in the approximation @xmath29 , may in principle be generally obtained  @xcite by replacing @xmath163 with @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is an average ( constant ) value of the interaction . in our case , it is then straightforward to show @xmath166 in this example we now have analytic expressions for the matrix elements of both the evolution operator @xmath167 that contains time ordering and the evolution operator @xmath168 without time ordering .",
    "it may be shown analytically  @xcite that for two kicks both proportional to @xmath158 , the order of the kicks does not change the final transfer probability @xmath169 . however , interestingly , this does not mean that there is no effect due to time ordering in this case . as we show next , there is an effect due to time ordering in this case , even though interchanging the order of the kicks has no effect .",
    "the effect of time ordering on the occupation probabilities may be examined by considering the probability of population transfer from the on state to the off state with and without time ordering , namely from eqs .",
    "( [ u - kk1 ] ) and ( [ u - kk20 ] ) ,    @xmath170 and @xmath171 .    the effect of time ordering is shown in fig .",
    "[ figdifference ] , where @xmath172 is plotted as a function of @xmath173 , corresponding to the strength of the kicks , and @xmath174 , which varies with the time separation of the two kicks .",
    "the effect of time ordering disappears in our example in the limit that either the interaction strength or the time separation between the pulses goes to zero . for small , but finite , values of both the interaction strength and the time separation between the pulses , the effect of time ordering is to reduce the transition probability from the initially occupied state to an initially unoccupied state .",
    "that is , in this regime time ordering reduces the maximum transfer of population from one state to another .",
    "as either of these two parameters gets sufficiently large , the effect of time ordering oscillates with increasing values of the interaction strength or the inter - pulse separation time .",
    "time ordering effects are present even though @xmath175 .",
    "let us now pause to examine the difference between time ordering and time reversal in this simple , illustrative example .",
    "reversal of time ordering means that , since kick strengths @xmath176 and kick times @xmath135 are both interchanged , @xmath177 and @xmath178 . in this case",
    "one sees from eqs .",
    "( [ u - kk1 ] ) and ( [ u - kk20 ] ) that @xmath167 experiences a change of phase , while @xmath179 is invariant under change of time ordering . for time reversal  @xcite , @xmath180 and , since the initial and final states are also interchanged , @xmath181 .",
    "inspection of the same equations as above shows that @xmath182 and @xmath183 are both invariant under time reversal , as expected .",
    "when the symmetry between the kicks @xmath184 and @xmath185 is broken , i.e. @xmath186 , the difference between @xmath187 and @xmath188 can be observed  @xcite .      as an illustrative specific example",
    ", we present the results of numerical calculations for @xmath189 transitions in atomic hydrogen caused by a gaussian pulse of finite width @xmath111 .",
    "the occupation probabilities of the @xmath190 and @xmath191 states are evaluated by integrating the two - state equations using a standard fourth order runge - kutta method . this enables us to verify the validity of our analytic solutions for kicked qubits in the limit @xmath192 and also to consider the effects of finite pulse width . in this system , the unperturbed level splitting is the @xmath193 shift , @xmath194 .",
    "the corresponding time scale is the rabi time , @xmath195  ps , which gives the period of oscillation between the states . in our numerical calculations we use for convenience a gaussian pulse of the form @xmath196 .",
    "the two - state coupled equations for the amplitudes @xmath197 and @xmath198 of eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) take the form implied by eq .",
    "( [ genh0 ] ) , @xmath199 here the pulse is applied at @xmath200 ps and we have chosen @xmath201 so that in the limit of a perfect kick all of the population will be transferred from the @xmath190 to the @xmath191 state after @xmath202 . in fig .",
    "[ fignumeric ] , the resulting transition probability is shown as a function of pulse width @xmath111 and as a function of observation time @xmath203 for @xmath204 .    in the schrdinger picture",
    "there are very large differences between the transition probabilities with and without time ordering , @xmath205 and @xmath206 , even for an ideal kick .",
    "this occurs because the energy splitting @xmath120 is non - zero , and for @xmath207 , the average potential @xmath208 becomes smaller than the energy splitting @xmath120 .",
    "thus , for a given pulse , the influence of the potential necessarily decreases at large @xmath203 , and any transfer probability becomes exponentially small . in effect , the free propagation before and after the pulse diminishes the effect of the pulse itself in the schrdinger picture , when time ordering is removed .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the intermediate picture result , where @xmath209 depends on @xmath210 but not on @xmath203 , as seen on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fignumeric ] .",
    "the contrast is also evident on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fignumeric ] , where , after the pulse has died off , the value of @xmath211 decays with increasing @xmath203 , while @xmath209 approaches a constant .      to our knowledge",
    "relatively little has been understood analytically for systems of coupled qubits .",
    "understanding coupling between qubits is a well recognized challenge in the field of quantum computing  @xcite . in our view , developing a realistic analytic model for two coupled qubits could provide a useful and instructive example in the fields of quantum computing , quantum information and coherent control .",
    "unitary evolution operators acting on a system of non - interacting qubits formally belong to the @xmath212 unitary group , which is simply the set of all local qubit operations .",
    "this set is a subgroup of the full @xmath213 dynamic group of n coupled qubits .",
    "the @xmath214 dynamic group of two interacting qubits plays a fundamental role in the analysis of multi - qubit dynamics since any operator ( i.e. quantum gate ) from the full @xmath213 group can be factorized as a product of @xmath214 two - qubit gates . in connection with this property , it is useful to note that any @xmath215-level quantum system can be used to encode a tensor - product four - dimensional hilbert space of two qubits .",
    "the specific form of such encoding is completely determined  @xcite by fixing one point on the orbit of the maximal @xmath216 subgroup of @xmath214 .",
    "next , the @xmath217-qubit system ( e.g. a carrier space for ghz multiparticle entangled states ) can be similarly encoded in an arbitrary @xmath218-level quantum system .",
    "this requires two steps : identifying the maximal @xmath219 subgroup of @xmath220 , and then adjusting the @xmath221 subgroup of the resulting @xmath214 group",
    ".    it would be useful to have a well developed theory for time correlations between interacting qubits ",
    "one that clarifies how the time dependence of a field acting on one qubit impacts the time evolution of another qubit , for example in switching .",
    "however , defining the independent time approximation for n - qubit systems in a useful way is a challenge .",
    "although working with @xmath222 degenerate states is doable in principle  @xcite ( setting aside the problem of solving an @xmath223-th order equation for @xmath224 ) , this does not always give the nto approximation , seemingly a prerequisite for the ita approximation needed to define time correlations .",
    "furthermore , in many cases sequencing of external interactions can be problematic . for example , if @xmath225 for two particles or qubits @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and @xmath228 , then the ita is _ not _ @xmath229 in general .",
    "the ita _ is _ given by @xmath230 if @xmath231 = 0 $ ] , but in that case all time correlations vanish and the ita is exact .",
    "also , it difficult for us to envision how one may satisfy @xmath232=0 $ ] with @xmath233 \\neq 0 $ ] for @xmath234 @xmath227 .",
    "that is , in what situations can one eliminate inter - particle time correlations while retaining time ordering for individual particles ? if _ all _ commutators terms vanish , then time correlation effects and time ordering for individual particles are both absent .",
    "similarly , time correlation effects disappear if all parts of a composite @xmath43 are replaced by the time averaged value @xmath57 , but this again is equivalent to eliminating all time ordering , even within single - particle evolution .",
    "in solutions of the time dependent schrdinger equation there are only two sources of time dependence , namely the dyson time ordering operator @xmath24 and the explicit time dependence of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "this simplifies the study of how time dependence may influence the evolution of @xmath3-body quantum systems .",
    "the causal - like constraint of time ordering between fields acting on different particles can cause time correlation between the particles .",
    "that is , the time dependence of a field acting on one particle can influence the evolution of other particles .",
    "correlation is traditionally studied by defining an uncorrelated limit . in the case of time correlation",
    ", we have called this the independent time approximation ( ita ) , and have pointed out similarities ( e.g. in table  [ table1 ] ) to the widely used and practical independent particle approximation ( ipa ) that eliminates spatial correlations between particles .",
    "similarly , the limit of no time ordering ( nto ) can be defined by eliminating _",
    "all _ time ordering constraints , for fields acting on the same particle or on different particles .",
    "thus , the ita may be viewed as the nto applied to cross terms only .",
    "the ita or nto limit may be reached in several ways , but the most general seems to be to define a mean time - averaged coupling interaction ( as is done in the ipa ) .",
    "time ordering effects have been observed in weakly perturbed atomic collisions .",
    "one may also consider strongly perturbed systems of coupled qubits .",
    "however , relatively little has been done on this problem , which is a key problem in quantum computing . in this paper",
    "we considered the effect of time ordering on strongly perturbed single qubits . to do this , we focused on qubits subjected to fast strong external pulses called kicks , where useful analytic expressions for observable transition probabilities may be obtained . what we have found ( but not discussed here )",
    "is that the nto may be easier to implement than the ita .",
    "this means that the ita might be computationally awkward in general .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the nto ( and consequently the ita ) are dependent on the representation used .",
    "there is evidence that the intermediate representation is preferred .",
    "this suggests that one could find gauge dependence in specific nto and ita terms if mbpt is used , and raises a question  @xcite about the physical meaning of time ordering and time correlation .    in summary ,",
    "the methods we have developed in this paper are intended to probe the nature of how time works in quantum n - body systems . the focal point in our approach",
