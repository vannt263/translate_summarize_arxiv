    "radio pulsars provide a powerful tool for studying the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "the dispersion in their pulse arrival times probes the mean electron density .",
    "their very small diameters ensure that they display the full range of scintillation and scattering phenomena , which probe the fine spatial structure in the electron density .",
    "their pulse amplitudes exhibit a combination of diffractive and refractive intensity scintillation on times from seconds to months .",
    "compact emission from some bright active galactic nuclei can also show scintillation on times of hours to months , albeit smoothed by the effect of their larger angular diameters .",
    "the large body of pulsar scintillation data has been interpreted in terms of homogeneous isotropic kolmogorov turbulence in the interstellar plasma @xcite .",
    "see reviews by @xcite .",
    "however , a litany of observational evidence now points to the existence of compact ionized structures in the interstellar medium ( ism ) whose scattering characteristics are well beyond those of such homogeneous isotropic kolmogorov turbulence . in particular",
    "the scattering is seldom uniformly distributed along the line of sight .",
    "it is often dominated by one local region somewhere in the line of sight , which we refer to as a `` thin screen . ''",
    "although it is unlikely to resemble a screen , it is thin with respect to the total line of sight from the source to the observer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inhomogeneity in the turbulence is required on kiloparsec scales to explain how the level of pulsar scattering varies with distance and galactic coordinates @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneity is also required on the parsec scale in the local ism to explain the intermittent nature of the scintillation observed in a few quasars on hour - long time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , evidence for au - scale inhomogeneity in the turbulence comes from extreme scattering events ( eses ) , which are observed in a few quasars as rare , large ( 10 to 50% ) variations in flux density over several weeks @xcite .",
    "these are generally seen as a decrease in flux density attributed to the passage across the line of sight of an ionized cloud which either scatters @xcite or refracts @xcite the radiation .    in recent years",
    "there has also been increasing evidence that interstellar scattering ( iss ) is not only inhomogeneous but also anisotropic .",
    "the most direct measure of anisotropy is through very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) imaging of scattered brightness , but it is only detectable on a few heavily scattered lines of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "anisotropy in the iss diffraction pattern has also been measured indirectly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such observations give evidence for elongated fine structure in the ism on scales of thousands of kilometers , suggesting anisotropic magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence controlled by the magnetic field as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the examples cited above show departures from both homogeneity and isotropy in the ionized ism .",
    "it is possible , but by no means proven , that the various phenomena have a common origin in a population of au - scale anisotropic regions of enhanced density and turbulence which we here generically refer to as `` clouds . ''",
    "however , we note that such localized clouds must contain fine scale substructure that causes scattering at radio frequencies .",
    "such a population of clouds presents a serious puzzle .",
    "their number density must be many orders of magnitude greater than that of stars and their implied electron densities @xmath3  @xmath4 are much higher than expected in pressure equilibrium in the warm ionized phase ism @xcite .",
    "the discovery of parabolic arcs in the iss of pulsars by @xcite has added a powerful new tool for probing such clouds .",
    "many pulsars exhibit parabolic arcs in their secondary spectra ( ss ) , which is the power spectrum ( versus delay and doppler frequency ) of the dynamic spectrum of intensity ( versus frequency and time ) .",
    "the arcs are sometimes narrow ( in delay ) which implies scattering by a thin layer .",
    "the distribution of power in the ss often reveals anisotropic scattering and in some cases there are discrete downwards facing `` arclets , '' which also imply scattering from isolated anisotropic clouds ( `` cloudlets '' ) .",
    "see @xcite for interpretation of the arcs .",
    "the ss allows a two dimensional reconstruction of the scattered image from observations at a single receiver , since each point in the ss isolates the scintillation power associated with interference between pairs of points on the scattering disk",
    ". however the reconstruction can be model dependent and has an inherent two - fold ambiguity @xcite .",
    "occasionally one can also see isolated peaks in the ss corresponding to narrow bandwidth fringes in the dynamic spectrum @xcite .",
    "such fringes result from interference between the normal primary ( on - axis ) scattering disk and the off - axis discrete cloud .",
    "recent results from @xcite have compounded the difficulties in understanding the nature of the underlying ionized clouds .",
    "they observed the ss towards pulsar b0834@xmath006 and found four distinct arclets scattered through 7 to 12  mas which they interpreted as originating from @xmath50.2  au clouds requiring @xmath6  @xmath4 , similar to those invoked to explain eses towards quasars . by monitoring the evolution of structures in the secondary spectrum , they followed these clouds over three weeks and showed that they co - moved with the rest of the scattering material .",
    "in this paper we report vlbi observations of the scintillation from the same pulsar ( b0834@xmath006 ) in order to further investigate these clouds .",
    "we have developed a novel astrometry technique that makes use of ss - like quantities derived from the interferometer visibilities . using these `` secondary cross spectra '' ( defined in table  [ tab : defs ] )",
    ", we can accurately localize points on the scattering screen corresponding to high signal - to - noise pixels of the ss .",
    "we use the results of the astrometry of many such points to measure the distance and velocity of the interstellar clouds and so define a precise model for the scattering . applying this precise model to the astrometric image with the scattering model",
    "allows us to eliminate all the otherwise troublesome ambiguities and validates the model .",
    "we then use this precise model to recover the scattered image with even greater angular resolution from the secondary spectrum itself . in our observations the rayleigh resolution ( i.e. , synthesized beam ) of the vlbi array is about 35  mas , the astrometric precision is about 1  mas , and structure in the scattered image recovered by modeling is found on a scale of @xmath7  @xmath8as .",
    "pulsar b0834@xmath006 was observed as part of a global vlbi project on 2005 november 12 . to obtain the greatest astrometric precision we used four of the largest telescopes in the global vlbi network : arecibo ( ao ) ; the green bank telescope ( gbt ) ; jodrell bank ( jb ) ; and tied - array westerbork ( wb ) .",
    "we used a somewhat lower frequency than most secondary spectrum observations ( 327  mhz ) in order to obtain higher angular scattering and thus to better resolve the image with astrometry .",
    "baseband data were recorded using the mark5a disc recorders at all antennas .",
    "four dual circular polarization 8  mhz bands spanning the frequency range 310.5 to 342.5  mhz were recorded with four - level quantization , yielding a total data rate of 256  mbps per antenna . in order to minimize unwanted signals that may correlate between stations , the pulse calibration signals were disabled at all of the antennas .",
    "a total of 5700  s of on - source data were recorded .",
    "an initial correlation was performed using the vlba correlator in socorro , nm with typical continuum vlbi spectral and temporal resolutions .",
    "these correlator products were used for delay and bandpass determination .",
    "the raw data were recorrelated at swinburne university with the difx software correlator @xcite , whose flexibility enabled the data to be processed with extremely high spectral resolution .",
    "the output visibilities consisting of 32768 spectral channels per 8  mhz band ( 244  hz resolution ) were dumped every pulse period ( 1.25  s ) .",
    "the software correlator used incoherent dedispersion to apply a 125  ms wide on - pulse bin ; both the on- and off - pulse visibilities were recorded .",
    "the timing information from which the gate ephemeris was derived was determined through simultaneous pulsar timing observations made at the gbt .",
    "dynamic spectra were constructed from the autocorrelation spectra generated by the correlator for each polarization . in an analogous manner , _ dynamic cross spectra _ were formed from the cross correlation spectra ( visibilities ) . in the case of the power",
    "spectra the off - pulse spectra were subtracted from the on - pulse spectra , removing the telescope system noise and most radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "this was not necessary in forming clean dynamic cross spectra because the noise and rfi are not correlated between any two antennas .",
    "both the dynamic spectra and the dynamic cross spectra were averaged into 5-pulse time blocks to reduce the effect of the strong pulse - to - pulse intensity fluctuations . the total power in each 8  mhz band",
    "was constrained to be constant , a reasonable condition considering that 8  mhz is much wider than the diffractive scintillation bandwidth , measured here as @xmath9  khz , which we note is considerably narrower than 38  khz from @xcite .",
    "this process will suppress any refractive intensity fluctuations , however these would have a time scale of many days .",
    "the instrumental bandpasses were corrected using interferometric observations of a strong background source .",
    "delay , phase and amplitude calibration were derived from the observations of the target source itself using the coarsely averaged visibility data from the vlba correlator .",
    "since this applies _ self - calibration _ , the astrometric positions which we determine below are all referenced to the centroid of the intensity .",
    "after calibration , the two circular polarizations were summed to form the stokes parameter @xmath10 in order to maximize the signal to noise ratio , giving the dynamic spectra of total intensity , @xmath11 , for each antenna , and visibility , @xmath12 , for each baseline @xmath13 .",
    "the secondary spectra , @xmath14 , are squared amplitudes of the two - dimensional fourier transforms , @xmath15 , of the dynamic spectra of intensity . here",
    "the transform variables conjugate to frequency , @xmath16 , and time , @xmath17 , are delay , @xmath18 , and doppler frequency , @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 represents the complex two - dimensional fourier transforms of the complex dynamic cross spectra .",
    "as some of the quantities we discuss in this work have not yet been introduced in the literature , we summarize in table[tab : defs ] the conventions we adopt throughout for the various products derived from the correlator auto and cross correlations .",
    "the dynamic spectra have a spectral resolution of 244  hz over 8  mhz and temporal resolution of 6.25  s ( about 5 pulsar rotation periods ) over the observation duration of 6500  s , which are well - suited to resolving the diffractive scintillation , whose time scale is @xmath21  min and frequency scale is @xmath22  khz .",
    "thus the secondary spectra have a resolution of 125  ns in delay out to a maximum of 2.05  ms .",
    "they have resolution in doppler frequency of 0.15  mhz over a width of @xmath23  80  mhz .",
    "custom software was used for this and all subsequent data processing .    for the first time , dynamic spectra of right minus left circular polarization and the corresponding secondary spectra were computed to test for differential faraday rotation in the ism @xcite .",
    "no detectable signal , significant at the 0.1% level , was found in any of these differenced spectra . in a simple model",
    "this implies rotation measure differences across the image of less than @xmath24  radm@xmath25 on au scales @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]      the scattered brightness distribution can be recovered from the secondary spectrum if the intensity scintillations are weak , or if they are highly anisotropic @xcite . in this case",
    "the scintillations are highly anisotropic and we can make one - dimensional , strip integrated brightness distributions , @xmath26 , by strip integrating the two dimensional distribution over @xmath27 .",
    "then we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and the jacobian @xmath31 .",
    "then by sampling @xmath32 along the main arc where @xmath33 , we can estimate @xmath34 .",
    "this estimate is plotted in figure  6 without the 1  ms feature , which can not be represented on this plot since it is not on the main parabola .",
    "if the scattering comes from homogeneous anisotropic kolmogorov turbulence then the strip integrated brightness distribution is the fourier transform of the one - dimensional correlation function of the electric field , @xmath35 @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "we have plotted three such models over the observations in figure  [ fig : bright1d ] , each with a different value of @xmath37 , the coherence scale of the electric field .",
    "the middle model fits the data near the origin ( @xmath38  km ) and the other two give a rough estimate of the range of @xmath37 necessary to match the measurements .",
    "they correspond to changing the root mean square ( rms ) electron density by a factor of 2 ( wider curve ) or 0.5 ( narrower curve ) .",
    "one can see in the expanded view on the right that near @xmath39 = -10  mas there is a change in the rms electron density by a factor of 4 in a very small distance .",
    "the finest structure has an angular scale of about 0.1  mas , which corresponds to 0.05  au .",
    "this plot can also be made using the vlbi astrometric @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the large scale structure is the same but the small scale structures seen clearly in figure  [ fig : bright1d ] are smoothed out by the larger error bars in the vlbi astrometry .      while we have clear evidence for highly anisotropic scattering , it is difficult to estimate the axial ratio @xmath40 , which is usually defined by a contour at , say , half power in the two - dimensional scattered brightness distribution .",
    "estimates of the width in @xmath39 can be made from the one - dimensional brightness in figure  [ fig : bright1d ] .",
    "however , the width at the same level in @xmath27 is harder to estimate , since we have no information on brightness versus @xmath27 . as an alternative",
    ", we can define an apparent axial ratio @xmath41 from the scatter of the points in figure  [ astrometryfig ] independent of their brightness . here",
    "we define @xmath41 as the ratio of the rms width in @xmath27 to that in @xmath39 .",
    "the observed scatter in @xmath27 will of course be broadened by the astrometric errors , so that only an upper bound can be found on @xmath27 due to interstellar scattering .",
    "we apply these ideas to figure  [ centroidfig ] , which shows the astrometry from the main arc as a scatter plot of @xmath27 against @xmath39 superimposed from all four sub - bands . the black error bars show @xmath27 averaged into 0.5  mas bins in @xmath39 where the length of the bar is the standard deviation in each average . taken as a group the black points from the inner @xmath42  mas are consistent with a gaussian distribution with zero mean and 0.38  mas rms ; there are no points more than @xmath43 from zero and their error bars , which have not been corrected for the measurement error , have a mean value of 0.3  mas .",
    "thus the true scatter in @xmath27 is smaller than these errors , implying an intrinsic perpendicular rms width less than @xmath44  mas .",
    "taking the half width at half power in @xmath39 to be 3  mas from figure  [ fig : bright1d ] gives a lower bound on the axial ratio @xmath45 .",
    "similar estimates can be made from the ratios of the parallel to the perpendicular rms widths of the apex astrometry from both the vlbi and back - mapping methods .",
    "these yield @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the scattering axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "however , according to the viriginia tech spectral - line survey the pulsar lies @xmath48 from a @xmath49 long bright h@xmath50 filament at a position angle within about @xmath51 of our scattering axis .",
    "although there is a rough agreement in position angle we have no other evidence to support an association with our 30  mas long filament .",
    "while our main focus is the presentation of the remarkable results found from the observations , we now briefly consider what physical structures could be responsible for the scattering .",
    "following previous analyses of the iss phenomena , we assume that the basic cause is scattering by random ( presumably turbulent ) structures in the plasma density",
    ". the scale of such turbulence must extend down to well below the diffractive scale , @xmath52 . to obtain scattering angles of 25",
    "mas requires microstructure of the order of 1000  km .",
    "however , the turbulence is inhomogeneous over scales of 0.1 to 10  au as mentioned above and we must also account for the highly elongated shape of the main scattered image .",
    "first we ask whether the peaks in our scattered image , due to the arclets , could be the equivalent of `` speckles '' .",
    "discrete arclets are visible in the simulated secondary spectrum in figure  11 of cordes et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who computed the ss for a realization of a layer with a kolmogorov spectrum and an axial ratio 4:1 parallel to the simulated velocity .",
    "that figure shows very many fine arclets with apexes centered on a pronounced forward parabola . in independent realizations",
    "the arclet apexes appear at random locations , showing that they are the equivalent of speckles in a snapshot scattered image through a turbulent scattering layer .",
    "thus they do not map to deterministic structures in the layer .",
    "in contrast the discrete nature of the arclets and their sparser distribution in our observation suggests deflection by discrete structures , possibly similar to those responsible for extreme scattering events ( eses ) .",
    "the two basic models proposed for eses have been an enhancement in @xmath53 that causes a diverging `` lens '' @xcite or an enhancement in plasma turbulence that causes extra scattering @xcite .",
    "the result that the angle of arrival from the arclets is essentially independent of frequency implies that the waves are deflected at a fixed transverse distance from the pulsar line - of - sight by either refraction or scattering .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that specific isolated structures in the line of sight are responsible .",
    "the observed frequency independence constrains the angular size of a lens , based on the law of plasma refraction , to be a small fraction of the angle of deflection which we observe up to @xmath54  mas .",
    "similarly the size of a scattering center would have to be much smaller than this angle of deflection .",
    "the very high apparent axial ratio we observe strongly suggests that an ordered magnetic field determines the geometry of the scattering .",
    "the lack of any magneto - ionic signature ( i.e. , the exact match between the dynamic spectra in right and left circular polarizations ) implies that the radio frequency phase imposed by the plasma is simply proportional to the column density of the local electron density @xmath53 .",
    "we expect that plasma structures will be more tightly confined transverse to a magnetic field than parallel to it , i.e. , the density irregularities will be field - aligned as they are in the solar corona . since we expect such structures to scatter preferentially in their narrow dimension ,",
    "our initial idea is that the major axis of the angular scattering would be orthogonal to the mean magnetic field .",
    "thus one scenario for the main image is a roughly parallel set of filaments ( or sheets ) , controlled by a magnetic field at right angles to the axis of scattering and extending at least over the projected length of the image ( @xmath55  au ) .",
    "waves passing through a filament are scattered by 10 - 30  mas due to a locally enhanced column density of electrons ( and presumably higher plasma turbulence ) which would be seen as a single arclet .",
    "we call this first scenario the orthogonal geometry",
    ". the axial ratio @xmath40 would then correspond to the axial ratio of the micro - turbulence ( i.e. , at the diffractive scale ) .",
    "there is however , an alternative scenario in which a dense filament of plasma is confined by the local magnetic field , which is parallel to the axis of scattering .",
    "we call this the parallel geometry .",
    "such a filament must have denser knots of micro - turbulence , which are responsible for the discrete arclets .",
    "the flux ropes seen in the solar wind are a possible plasma structure ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the denser knots could scatter isotropically and so the filament would not have to be located exactly in front of the pulsar .",
    "in such a case the major axis of the scattered image ( about 3  mas ) would be determined by diffractive scattering caused by microstructures of the order of 3000  km in scale , but the minor axis would be set by the thickness of the filament .",
    "such scattering has been observed in the solar corona @xcite and discussed in the context of interstellar scattering by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the thickness of such a filament would be of the order of the size of a `` knot '' , on the order of 0.05  au or 0.1  mas .",
    "thus the filament is at least 16  au long , about 0.05  au in diameter , but not straight .",
    "the perpendicular rms angle of 0.4  mas would correspond to an rms irregularity in the filament of 0.2  au or 4 times its thickness .",
    "because the scattering is caused by a very thin structure in this model , the electron density in the filament would have to be considerably higher than normally expected ( about 5 @xmath4 ) to cause the observed angular scattering .    in the parallel filament model",
    "the 1  ms feature is readily explained as a separate offset filament of about the same density which is approximately parallel to the main filament .",
    "however , in the orthogonal geometry the observer would not detect the anisotropic scattering from a concentration of filaments nearly parallel to those causing the main arc .",
    "thus the basic simplicity of this geometry , that assumes the scattering is so anisotropic that the angles of scattering are transverse to the long spatial axis , must be augmented by an independent process of scattering or refraction to explain the 1  ms feature .",
    "a possible process is a localized plasma structure in that part of the sight line that refracts the scattered waves towards the observer . in this case",
    "the angular position of the 1  ms feature should have a @xmath56 wavelength dependence , which is inconsistent with that observed as shown in  [ sec : scaling ] .    in either geometry",
    "the existence of many sub - au sized discrete structures passing within 15  au of the line of sight to our pulsar raises the more general question of their distribution in interstellar space .",
    "the fact that the structures responsible lie at a common distance suggests that the pulsar happens to lie behind a single larger region consisting a cluster of many filaments of plasma or a single filament with very compact condensations ( knots ) .",
    "further the fact that @xcite observed similar arclets 22 months earlier suggests a region bigger than 40  au .",
    "two ideas that seem possible are a shock with multiple nearly parallel subshocks seems and the flux rope idea already mentioned .",
    "the number density of such regions can only be crudely constrained by the sparse statistical sampling of pulsars with similar multiple arclets .",
    "we hope to distinguish between these two basic geometries by detailed modelling of the propagation .",
    "this paper describes a novel vlbi technique resulting in a two - dimensional image of the scattering screen of pulsar b0834@xmath006 .",
    "the baseband data that were recorded allowed high resolution dynamic spectra to be produced .",
    "the secondary spectra produced with the two - hour dynamic spectra could allow sharply defined arclets to be identified with delays as high as 1  ms .",
    "the scattered image was developed by astrometrically mapping points chosen from the secondary spectrum to bright points in the sky plane .",
    "these points were clustered in two clearly defined groups : a primary scattering disk which is elongated and inclined @xmath57 to the pulsar proper motion direction and a second , non - colinear , feature corresponding to the 1  ms feature of the secondary spectrum .",
    "diagnostic measurements place the two features at essentially the same distance , 65% of the way to the pulsar .",
    "the two - dimensional distribution of points in the scattered image allows both transverse components of the effective velocity to be determined via relationships connecting the doppler frequency with location in the image .",
    "the discrete feature at 1  ms delay contains about 4% of the total received power .",
    "this feature is expected to to be visible only for a few weeks during which time its delay should drift as the pulsar moves ; the impact on timing this pulsar at @xmath58  mhz due to such a feature is a time variable wander with magnitude @xmath59  @xmath8s .",
    "this should come as a caution to those aiming to perform precision pulsar timing at low frequencies on pulsars that exhibit the extreme forms of scintillation that are characteristic of b0834@xmath006 .",
    "further , pulsars with sub - microsecond structure may experience apparent pulse profile evolution yielding additional complications in their timing .",
    "we were able to estimate the effective scintillation velocity vector , which depends on a distance - weigthed sum of the velocities of the pulsar , the earth and the sacttering plasma . by using",
    "the published proper motion we estimated the velocity of the scattering plasma to be @xmath60  approximately parallel to the scattering axis . since the errors in this interesting result are dominated by the uncertainty in the pulsar proper motion ,",
    "we have undertaken a new set of vlbi measurements to improve its precision .",
    "the interpretation of iss in pulsars has often assumed isotropy in the scattering .",
    "the extremely anisotropic scattering found here would substantially alter any quantitative modelling of the plasma were it to be a common feature in other regions on the interstellar medium .",
    "a description of the underlying plasma physics must await a resolution of the two possible geometries mentioned in the previous section , but the results and the method provide an exciting new glimpse of the ionized ism at scales of 0.1 to 10  au .",

    "<S> we have invented a novel technique to measure the radio image of a pulsar scattered by the interstellar plasma with 0.1  mas resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the `` secondary spectrum '' analysis of parabolic arcs by stinebring et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) to very long baseline interferometry and , when the scattering is anisotropic , we are able to map the scattered brightness astrometrically with much higher resolution than the diffractive limit of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> we employ this technique to measure an extremely anisotropic scattered image of the pulsar b0834@xmath006 at 327  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the scattering occurs in a compact region about 420  pc from the earth . </S>",
    "<S> this image has two components , both essentially linear and nearly parallel . </S>",
    "<S> the primary feature , which is about 16  au long and less than 0.5  au in width , is highly inhomogeneous on spatial scales as small as 0.05  au . </S>",
    "<S> the second feature is much fainter and is displaced from the axis of the primary feature by about 9  au . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the velocity of the scattering plasma is @xmath1  approximately parallel to the axis of the linear feature . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the observed anisotropy is unclear and we discuss two very different models . </S>",
    "<S> it could be , as has been assumed in earlier work , that the turbulence on spatial scales of ( @xmath2  km ) is homogeneous but anisotropic </S>",
    "<S> . however it may be that the turbulence on these scales is homogeneous and isotropic but the anisotropy is produced by highly elongated ( filamentary ) inhomogeneities of scale 0.05 - 16 au . </S>"
