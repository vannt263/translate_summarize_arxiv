    ".      frequency sweep ( chirp / harmonic excitation ) using a network analyzer for btf measurements is an established method primarily for beam stability analysis  @xcite .",
    "however , using this method for tune measurements during acceleration is not trivial , and thus the method is not suitable for tune measurements during the whole ramp cycle .",
    "nevertheless , this method offers advantages compared to the previous excitation method for careful interpretation of tune spectrum in storage mode , e.g. , injection plateau or extraction flat top .",
    "thus frequency sweep is used during measurements at injection plateau to compare and understand the dependence of tune spectra on the type of excitation .      following the beam excitation , the signals from each of the 12 shoe - box type bpms  @xcite at sis-18 pass through a high dynamic range ( 90 db ) and broadband ( 100 mhz ) amplifier chain from the synchrotron tunnel to the electronics room , where the signals are digitized using fast 14 bit adcs at 125 msa / s .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of bbq has been measured to be @xmath11110 - 15 db higher than that of topos under the present configuration .",
    "the main reason for the difference is the relative bandwidth of the two systems and their tune detection principles . in bbq",
    ", the tune signal is obtained using analog electronics ( diode based peak detectors and differential amplifier ) immediately after the bpm plates , while in topos position calculation is done after passing the whole bunch signal through a wide bandwidth amplifier chain . even though the bunches are integrated to calculate position in topos which serves as a low pass filter ,",

    "in this section we will discuss the application of our results to tune measurements in the sis-18 and in the projected sis-100 , as part of the fair project at gsi @xcite .",
    "as shown in the previous section the relative amplitudes of the synchrotron satellites in the tune spectra are primarily a function of chromaticity and possibly the excitation mechanism . in order to determine the coherent tune with high precision the position of the @xmath123 mode has to be measured .",
    "depending on the machine settings , if the relative height of the @xmath123 peak with respect to the other modes is small , then the @xmath123 mode may not be visible at all . to estimate the bare tune frequency in this case ,",
    "the information of space charge parameter , coherent tune shift and chromaticity are all simultaneously required with good precision .",
    "another important point is the tune measurement during acceleration .",
    "the space charge parameter for @xmath167 stored ions in the sis-18 from injection to extraction reduces only by @xmath168 as shown in   .",
    "the dynamic shift of head - tail modes during acceleration is shown in   obtained from topos system under same conditions .",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath169 modes around @xmath123 mode can only be understood in view of the space charge effects predicted by   .",
    "thus , a correct estimate of this parameter plays an important role in understanding the tune spectra not only during dedicated experiments on injection plateau , but also during regular operations .",
    "the measurement time required to resolve the various head - tail modes ( @xmath170 ) is a complex function of @xmath18 , @xmath83 , beam intensity and excitation power . to give some typical numbers for sis-18 ; on a measurement time of 600 ms on the injection plateau , if one spectrum is obtained in @xmath171 ms ( @xmath172 turns ) , an improvement of factor @xmath173 in snr by averaging 30 spectra .",
    "following the calculations in   , @xmath148 can be resolved under typical injection operations . however , the constraints on measurement time are much higher during acceleration , where the tune / revolution frequency increases due to acceleration .",
    "this allows the measurement of a single spectrum typically only over @xmath174 turns ( depends on ramp rate as well ) .",
    "there are no averaging possibilities since the tune is moving during acceleration due to dynamic changes in machine settings as seen in   .",
    "in addition , the synchrotron tune reduces with acceleration making it practically very difficult to resolve the fine structure of the head - tail modes for @xmath175 .     with @xmath176 particles .",
    "the estimated space charge parameter reduces by @xmath168 in this typical case from injection at 11.4 mev / u to 300 mev / u at extraction.,width=321 ]     and @xmath124 modes around @xmath123 is maintained throughout the ramp which depends primarily on the space charge parameter @xmath177.,width=321 ]",
    "two complimentary tune measurement systems , topos and bbq , installed in the sis-18 are presented .",
    "analytical as well as simulation models predict a characteristic modification of the tune spectra due to space charge and image current effects in intense bunches .",
    "the position of the synchrotron satellites corresponds to the head - tail tune shifts and depends on the incoherent and the coherent tune shifts .",
    "the modification of the tune spectra for different bunch intensities has been observed in the sis-18 at injection energy , using the topos and bbq systems . from the measured spectra",
    "the coherent and incoherent tune shift for bunched beams in sis-18 at injection energies were obtained experimentally using the analytic expression for the head - tail tune shifts .",
    "head - tail modes were individually excited and identified in time domain and correlated with the spectral information .",
    "a novel method for determination of chromaticity based on gated excitation of individual head tail mode is shown .",
    "the dependence of the relative amplitudes of various head - tail modes on chromaticity is also studied .",
    "the systems were compared against each other as well as with different kinds of excitation mechanisms and their respective powers .",
    "these measurements give a clear interpretation of tune spectra at all stages during acceleration under typical operating conditions . the understanding to tune",
    "spectra provides an important input to new developments related to planned transverse feedback systems for sis-18 and sis-100 .",
    "the measurement systems also open new possibilities for detailed beam investigations as demonstrated in this contribution .",

    "the calculation of @xmath46 from   has a dependence on measured current , transverse beam profiles , longitudinal beam profiles and the twiss parameters .",
    "the measurement uncertainty on each of these measured parameters at gsi sis-18 were commented in the detailed analysis in  @xcite . even though some parameters and the associated uncertainties are correlated ,",
    "any correlations are neglected in present analysis .",
    "uncertainties in each measured parameter are propagated to find the error bars on the calculated and measured incoherent tune shifts .",
    "where @xmath185 mm is the wire spacing and @xmath186 is the adc resolution of the ipm and b is defined as @xmath187 . if the error bars are derived from @xmath188 measurements , the measured profile is given by @xmath189 for each tune measurement at the given intensity and excitation power , 5 - 8 transverse beam profiles were measured , and the relative error is obtained @xmath110 using   and   . the relative systematic error ( bias ) in transverse beam width measurements is @xmath190  @xcite and ignored in this analysis .",
    "the uncertainty in the injected current is dominated by fluctuations in the source and the relative uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath110 based on 5 - 8 measurements at the same intensity settings for each measurement point .",
    "bunch length and bunching factor vary by @xmath191 due to long term beam losses only under high intensity beam conditions . the maximum relative bias in the lattice parameter @xmath192 is assumed to be @xmath110 at the ipm location .",
    "taking all the relative errors , uncertainty propagation using familiar   gives relative error for estimated incoherent tune shifts @xmath193 .",
    "@xmath194    tune measurements done by averaging over long intervals contribute to the width of modes due to long term beam losses .",
