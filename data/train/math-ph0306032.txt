    "in this paper we consider the microscopic and the macroscopic properties of a class of generalized statistics , referred to as @xmath0-superstatistics . in our approach ,",
    "the starting point is a certain symmetry principle , characterized by an algebra of creation and annihilation operators ( cao s ) with fock type representations .",
    "the idea behind these investigations is based on a few observations .",
    "the first one is that any @xmath4 pairs of bose cao s @xmath5 generate a representation , the bose representation @xmath6 , of the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath7 .",
    "the representation independent generators @xmath8 of @xmath9 , which in the bose representation coincide with the bose operators @xmath10 , are para - bose cao s  @xcite and satisfy the relations @xmath11= ( \\epsilon-\\xi)\\delta_{ik}\\hat{b}_j^\\eta + ( \\epsilon-\\eta)\\delta_{jk}\\hat{b}_i^\\xi , \\quad \\xi , \\eta , \\epsilon = \\pm\\hbox { or } \\pm 1 .",
    "\\label{pb}\\ ] ] these triple relations give one possible definition of the lie superalgebra @xmath9  @xcite , and are considered as the defining relations of para - bose statistics .",
    "so ordinary bose statistics corresponds to one particular realization of para - bose statistics .",
    "the situation with fermi statistics and its generalization , para - fermi statistics  @xcite , is similar .",
    "so the second observation is that any @xmath4 pairs of fermi cao s @xmath12 give a representation , the fermi representation @xmath13 , of the orthogonal lie algebra @xmath14 and any @xmath4 pairs of para - fermi caos @xmath15 , with @xmath16,\\hat{f}_k^\\epsilon]= { 1\\over 2}(\\eta-\\epsilon)^2\\delta_{jk}\\hat{f}_i^\\xi -{1\\over 2}(\\xi-\\epsilon)^2\\delta_{ik}\\hat{f}_j^\\eta , \\quad\\xi , \\eta , \\epsilon = \\pm\\hbox { or } \\pm 1 , \\label{pf}\\ ] ] generate the algebra @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "both algebras @xmath17 ( every lie algebra is also a lie superalgebra ) and @xmath18 belong to the class @xmath19 of basic classical lie superalgebras in the classification of kac  @xcite . hence ordinary bose and fermi statistics and their generalizations para - bose and para - fermi statistics could be referred to as @xmath19-(super)statistics .    on the ground of these facts statistics related to the other classes of basic lie superalgebras",
    "were introduced  : @xmath0- , @xmath19- , @xmath20- and @xmath21-(super)statistics  @xcite .",
    "so far only @xmath0-statistics ( corresponding to the lie algebra @xmath22 ) was studied in detail from the microscopic  @xcite ,  @xcite and macroscopic point of view  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the properties of @xmath0-superstatistics  @xcite , namely the statistics arising from the lie superalgebra @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the microscopic properties of this statistics related to @xmath24 lead to the introduction of fermi - like operators @xmath25 , and these are relevant for the description of certain physical models ( see section 3 ) . in particular , lattice models of strongly correlated electron systems use these operators @xmath25 ( in a certain representation ) . also , the so - called ideal odd - particle creation and annihilation operators of klein and marshalek in nuclear shell model theory correspond to a particular realization of the operators @xmath25 .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the microscopic properties of this new class of generalized statistics .",
    "first we recall the definitions of the lie superalgebras @xmath2 and @xmath24 and their fock representations . like for para - bose and para - fermi statistics",
    ", the generators @xmath25 , @xmath26 of @xmath2 satisfy certain triple relations .",
    "these relations completely define the lie superalgebra @xmath2 , just as the triple relations for the generators @xmath27 , @xmath28 of @xmath0-statistics do for the lie algebra @xmath22  @xcite . for @xmath22 , this property of the operators @xmath27",
    "was first observed by jacobson  @xcite and therefore the generators @xmath27 are referred as jacobson generators of @xmath22  @xcite . by analogy",
    "we call the generators @xmath25 of @xmath2 also jacobson generators of @xmath2",
    ". the fock representations of @xmath0-superstatistics are constructed in the same way as in parastatistics .",
    "they are generated by the operators @xmath29 and labeled by a positive integer @xmath30 within the corresponding module @xmath31 the generator @xmath29 ( respectively @xmath32 ) can be interpreted as a creation ( respectively annihilation ) operator of a  particle \" on the @xmath33th orbital ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the pauli principle of @xmath0-superstatistics is formulated and in section 3 it is indicated that in the limit @xmath35 the representation dependent operators @xmath36 coincide with ordinary fermi cao s .",
    "we complete this section by showing that the jacobson generators of @xmath2 are implicitly present in certain physical models .",
    "the following sections are devoted to the macroscopic properties of @xmath0-superstatistics . in section 4",
    "we construct explicitly the @xmath2 grand partition function @xmath37 ( gpf ) , the average number of particles in the system @xmath38 and the average number of particles on each orbital @xmath39 under the assumption that the energy of each particle on orbital @xmath33 is @xmath40 .",
    "all these thermal properties of the system are described by means of the elementary symmetric functions . the fact that symmetric functions appear naturally in the description of ( grand ) partition functions in statistical mechanics got attention recently  @xcite . for quantum systems with bose or fermi statistics ,",
    "see  @xcite . for quantum systems with @xmath0-statistics ,",
    "the relevant symmetric functions are the so - called complete symmetric functions  @xcite . here in the case of @xmath0-superstatistics ,",
    "the relevant symmetric functions are the so - called elementary symmetric functions .",
    "then we consider two specializations of the general case of section 4 . in section 5 the energy and the chemical potential of each orbital",
    "are assumed to be the same .",
    "this is the so - called degenerate case .",
    "the thermodynamical functions simplify , and many of these can be expressed as hypergeometric series .",
    "furthermore , these functions can be seen as deformations of the corresponding ones in the case of fermi statistics . in section 6",
    "we investigate a model with equidistant energy levels . also under this specialization ,",
    "the thermodynamical functions assume a simple form , usually in terms of @xmath41-generalized or basic hypergeometric functions .    it should be emphasized that our notion `` @xmath0-superstatistics '' refers to a generalized quantum statistics based upon the lie superalgebra of type @xmath0 , and that it should not be confused with the recently introduce phenomenon of `` superstatistics '' as in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-superstatistics is defined in the context of the lie superalgebra @xmath2 or @xmath24",
    ". a convenient basis of @xmath24 is given with the weyl generators @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "the grading of @xmath24 is as follows  : the _ even _ elements are given by @xmath44 and @xmath42 with @xmath45 ; the _ odd _ elements are @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the lie superalgebra bracket is determined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is 0 ( resp .",
    "1 ) if @xmath42 is even ( resp .",
    "one can define @xmath2 as the ( super)commutator algebra of @xmath24 ; its basis consists of all elements @xmath42 ( @xmath51 ) and the cartan elements @xmath52 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the jacobson creation and annihilation operators @xmath25 of @xmath2 are given by @xmath53 it is known  @xcite that the linear envelope of @xmath54 is indeed the lie superalgebra @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath0-superstatistics is determined by the relations that hold for the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "these are  : @xmath55 = \\delta_{jk } f_i^+ - \\delta_{ij } f_k^+,\\\\ & & [ \\ { f_i^+ , f_j^- \\ } , f_k^- ] = -\\delta_{ik } f_j^- + \\delta_{ij } f_k^- . \\label{2.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth observing that these operators satisfy the compatibility conditions required in the context of wigner quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the fock representations of @xmath0-superstatistics have been classified by palev  @xcite .",
    "these representations are labeled by a positive integer @xmath56 , the order of statistics .",
    "let us denote the fock representation of order @xmath56 for @xmath2 by @xmath31 .",
    "the space @xmath31 is characterized by a vacuum vector @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 these fock spaces are finite - dimensional unitary irreducible @xmath2-modules .",
    "a set of basis vectors for the space @xmath31 consists of all vectors @xmath59 where @xmath60 the linear span of all vectors ( [ allvectors ] ) , without the restriction  ( [ restriction ] ) , also forms a @xmath2 module @xmath61 .",
    "however , if @xmath62 , @xmath61 is not irreducible  : it contains a maximal invariant submodule , and @xmath31 is the quotient module of @xmath61 with respect to this submodule .",

    "the transformation of the basis ( [ orthvectors ] ) under the action of the creation and annihilation operators reads  : @xmath69 our hamiltonian will be an element from ( the cartan subalgebra of ) @xmath24",

    "for this purpose , we set @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , and have  : @xmath72    we shall be studying macroscopic properties of @xmath0-superstatistics for a hamiltonian of the following form  : @xmath73 via creation and annihilation operators , this can be rewritten as @xmath74 clearly , @xmath75 ( so the vacuum has zero energy ) , and @xmath76 = \\pm\\epsilon_i f_i^\\pm.\\ ] ] therefore , each @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath32 ) can be interpreted as an operator creating ( resp .",
    "annihilating ) a particle ( or quasiparticle , or excitation ) on orbital  @xmath33 ( with energy  @xmath40 ) . since @xmath77 @xmath78 is interpreted as a state with @xmath79 particles on orbital  @xmath33 .",
    "the cao s of @xmath2 together with the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) generate @xmath24 .",
    "then , in view of ( [ hf ] ) , @xmath80 , considered as operators in any @xmath31 , generate @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason we call the cao s of @xmath2 also jacobson generators  @xcite of @xmath24 .",
    "the _ pauli principle _ for @xmath0-superstatistics follows basically from equation  ( [ restriction ] ) and the form of the vectors  ( [ orthvectors ] ) .",
    "these relations imply that the system can accommodate up to @xmath81 , but no more than @xmath81 particles , in such a way that every orbital contains at most one particle .",
    "note that in the atypical cases @xmath82 the pauli principle introduces an interaction , a statistical interaction , between the orbitals .",
    "for instance if the system is in the state with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , then it can not accommodate more particles , not even on the empty orbitals with @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the orbitals are not filled independently .",
    "the filling of a given orbital depends on fillings of all other orbitals , which is the main feature of exclusion statistics  @xcite .",
    "observe also that @xmath0-superstatistics is closely related to ordinary fermi statistics  : the only extra condition comes from the order of statistics  @xmath56 .",
    "in the present section we discuss some differences and similarities between @xmath0-superstatistics and ordinary fermi statistics .",
    "first of all , observe that there is an important difference between the fock spaces @xmath31 with @xmath62 and those with @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath62 , the irreducible @xmath2 representations are _ atypical _ , and their dimension is given by  : @xmath86 for @xmath63 , the representations @xmath31 are all typical , with @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the representations @xmath90 and @xmath91 are certainly not isomorphic ( even though they have the same dimension ) , since they have a different highest weight .",
    "let @xmath4 be fixed , @xmath63 , and let us define representation - dependent operators @xmath92 in @xmath31 by @xmath93 the action of these new creation and annihilation operators on the vectors  ( [ orthvectors ] ) reads  : @xmath94 on the other hand , one can consider a set of @xmath4 ordinary fermi creation and annihilation operators @xmath95 ( @xmath48 ) , satisfying  : @xmath96 and its @xmath97-dimensional fock space @xmath98 with orthonormal basis vectors @xmath99 and action latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }   f_i^- |\\t\\ra & = & \\t_i ( -1)^{\\t_1+\\cdots+\\t_{i-1 } }   |\\t_1,\\ldots,\\t_i-1,\\ldots,\\t_n\\ra , \\label{fi-}\\\\   f_i^+ |\\t\\ra & = & ( 1-\\t_i ) ( -1)^{\\t_1+\\cdots+\\t_{i-1 } }    now identify the basis vectors @xmath78 of @xmath31 with the vectors @xmath101 of @xmath98 .",
    "let us therefore define , for a given positive integer @xmath63 , in @xmath98 a realization of the operators @xmath92 , denoted by @xmath102 , through the action  : @xmath103 both @xmath102 and @xmath95 are now operators acting in the finite - dimensional fock space @xmath98 , and from their action it follows immediately that @xmath104 for this reason , the operators @xmath92 are said to be quasi - fermi creation and annihilation operators . for large @xmath56-values , they tend to ordinary fermi creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it is interesting to consider the anti - commutators of the quasi - fermi creation and annihilation operators , acting in the fermi fock space @xmath98 . from  ( [ 3.39])-([3.40 ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath105 compare again with  ( [ fermi - anticomm ] ) to see that the above anti - commutators tend to ordinary fermi anticommutators when @xmath56 tends to infinity .",
    "also in this sense , the quasi - fermi creation and annihilation operators @xmath102 can be considered as `` deformations '' of ordinary fermi creation and annihilation operators , with the integer @xmath56 ( the order of statistics ) as a deformation parameter .",
    "a comparison of  ( [ fi-])-([fi+ ] ) for @xmath63 with  ( [ fi-])-([fi+ ] ) shows that the jacobson generators of @xmath2 can be expressed as functions of ordinary fermi creation and annihilation operators @xmath106 . let @xmath31 be a typical representation ( so with @xmath63 ) , and identify again its basis vectors @xmath107 with the basis vectors @xmath108 of the fermi fock space @xmath98 .",
    "since @xmath109 is a number operator for fermions in a state @xmath33 , @xmath110 we can write for  ( [ fi+ ] ) @xmath111 the latter can be represented as @xmath112 equation  ( [ fi+fi+ ] ) holds for any @xmath113 .",
    "therefore @xmath114 in a similar way one derives from  ( [ fi- ] ) @xmath115 evidently ( see  [ n0 ] ) , @xmath116 and simple calculations lead to @xmath117 in such a way we have expressed all weyl generators @xmath118 of @xmath24 via @xmath4 pairs of fermi operators .",
    "let us mention that the `` ferminization ''  ( [ fermi+])-([fermi- ] ) of the jacobson generators of @xmath2 is not new .",
    "it is known as the holstein - primakoff realization of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the use of boson or fermion operators to construct representations of lie algebras or lie superalgebras has a long history . for lie superalgebras ,",
    "see   for a realization of the algebra in terms of bose and fermi operators and a construction of the corresponding representations .",
    "finally , we wish to mention that the jacobson generators of @xmath24 and the considered fock representations @xmath31 ( or equivalently , the quasi - fermi operators ) are implicitly present in certain physical models .",
    "examples from condensed matter physics include mainly models related in one or another way to high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "we have in mind those lattice models of strongly correlated electron systems where ( the electronic part of ) the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of hubbard operators ( @xmath119-operators )  @xcite as for instance in @xcite or in @xcite . in such models ,",
    "each hubbard operator is labeled by three indices , @xmath120 , where @xmath0 refers to the lattice site and @xmath121 , if the ( combined spin - flavor ) degrees of freedom ( the number of the orbitals ) of the electrons at each fixed site are @xmath122 .",
    "for any site the operators @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 , are said to be fermion - like generators ( or of odd degree ) , whereas @xmath126 , @xmath120 , @xmath127 are boson - like generators ( or of even degree ) .",

    "( [ weyl ] ) . since moreover for @xmath130 the @xmath119-operators supercommute , @xmath131",
    ", the conclusion is that all hubbard operators constitute a basis in the algebra @xmath132 which is a direct sum of all @xmath133 , i.e. , = _ a gl(1|n)_a .",

    "since @xmath138 is required to be a non - negative integer , only such sets of numbers @xmath139 , are admitted for which @xmath140 the physical interpretation of the state ( [ n00 ] ) is that it corresponds to a configuration with @xmath141 electrons on the first orbital , @xmath142 electrons on the second orbital , etc .",
    "the action of the @xmath119-operators on the states ( [ n00 ] ) reads ( throughout below @xmath143 )  @xcite  : @xmath144    in eqs .",

    ". however , these operators are not fermi creation and annihilation operators in the strict sense because @xmath148 .",
    "comparison with the formulas from section  2 now leads to the identification of the hubbard model hilbert space with the representation @xmath31 , where @xmath149 furthermore , the hubbard operators ( on a fixed site @xmath0 ) are expressed in terms of the jacobson creation and annihilation operators @xmath150 of @xmath24  : @xmath151    so the conclusion is that the operators @xmath145 and @xmath146 , creating and annihilating electrons at site @xmath0 , are not fermi operators .",
    "they are creation and annihilation operators of the lie superalgebra @xmath24 .",
    "the statistics of the electrons or of any other ( quasi)particles described with these operators is not fermi statistics , it is @xmath0-superstatistics of order @xmath56 .    in order to quote an example from nuclear physics , note that the @xmath137 jacobson generators @xmath80 of @xmath2 together with @xmath152 satisfy the relations  : @xmath153 in nuclear shell model theory the operators with the above properties are called _ ideal odd - particle _ ( iop ) creation and annihilation operators  @xcite .",

    "the iop operators play a relevant role for the description of properties of odd nuclei in the frame of the nuclear shell model ( see the review article  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "to describe the macroscopic properties of @xmath0-superstatistics for the hamiltonian @xmath154 with orbitals  @xmath33 ( @xmath48 ) , see ( [ h ] ) , it is for us irrelevant whether the different orbitals correspond to different particles , to different energy levels of particles , or to different internal states of the particles .",
    "the only assumption is that they satisfy the pauli principle for @xmath0-superstatistics , which follows from the fock space construction .    as usually , we assume that the system is in a thermal and diffusive contact and in a thermal and diffusive equilibrium with a much bigger reservoir .",

    "the gpf is simply a product of the gpfs of all orbitals .",
    "this is due to the fact that for those statistics the different orbitals can be considered as independent subsystems  : the filling of each orbital is completely independent of the number of particles that have already been accommodated on the other orbitals . here due to the new pauli principle this is no longer the case if @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we have to compute directly the gpf for the whole system .",

    "it is appropriate to introduce the elementary symmetric functions @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "the @xmath147-th elementary symmetric function  @xcite is the sum over all products of @xmath147 distinct variables @xmath172 , so that @xmath173 and @xmath174 for instance , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",

    "from the sum of the corresponding gibbs factors , one finds  : @xmath197 the last relation follows from the trivial observation @xmath198 by the symmetry ( of the symmetric functions ) , these probabilities extend to any orbital  @xmath33  : @xmath199 herein , @xmath200 stands for the @xmath201-tuple obtained by removing @xmath172 from the @xmath4-tuple @xmath202 .",
    "it is now clear that the average number of particles on the @xmath33-th orbital , denoted by @xmath203 , is just @xmath204 .",

    "similarly the average number of particles in the system for @xmath169 is @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the average particle number in the case of fermi statistics .",
    "the average energy of the particles on the @xmath33-th orbital is given by @xmath212 and the average energy of the total system is @xmath213 we can again express the average energy in the case @xmath169 via the average energy in the fermi case @xmath214 , and the fermi averages @xmath208  : @xmath215    also other thermodynamical functions , such as the entropy @xmath216 and the heat capacity @xmath217 , defined in terms of the grand partition function and the average energy , can be computed .",
    "the formulation of these expressions in terms of symmetric functions does not lead to further simplifications or insights , so we shall not deal with these .",
    "let us consider as a particular example a hamiltonian of the form @xmath218 thus we assume that all orbitals have the same energy , and let us furthermore assume that they also have the same chemical potential , i.e.  @xmath219 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the microscopic and thermal ( macroscopic ) properties of `` free '' particles , interacting only via statistical interaction .",
    "this interaction follows from the pauli principle of @xmath0-superstatistics  : the system can not accommodate more than @xmath56 particles if the order of statistics is @xmath56 , irrespective of the number of available orbitals ( which may even be infinite ) .",

    ". it may be unusual and unconventional to consider such alternative creation and annihilation operators .",
    "however , we show that ( representations of ) such operators have already appeared in physical models , proving their applicability .    in the second part of the paper we focuss on the macroscopic properties of @xmath0-superstatistics , for a free hamiltonian .",
    "the usual thermal functions ( grand partition function , average number of particles , orbital distribution , average energy , @xmath264 ) are expressed in terms of elementary symmetric functions , and can be considered as deviations of the usual fermi case when @xmath62 .",
    "in addition to the general case , we have considered two specific examples . the case with identical energy levels per orbital ( degenerate case ) leads to further simplifications of the thermal functions , and the deviation from fermi statistics ( for @xmath62 ) becomes more apparent .",
    "the corresponding distribution functions are reminiscent of the fermi - dirac case , but there are also some striking differences ( see figures  1 and  2 ) .",
    "the case with equidistant energy levels is interesting from the mathematical point of view , since the thermal functions have simple expressions in terms of @xmath41-series ( or basic hypergeometric series ) .",
    "this can be considered as a @xmath41-deformation of the degenerate case , and in fact the degenerate case can be deduced from the current one under the limit @xmath265 . also the situation with equidistant energy levels yields some interesting physical interpretations , e.g.  concerning the orbital distribution ( see figure  3 ) .    in this paper , @xmath0-superstatistics was introduced mainly on the ground of mathematical considerations .",
    "therefore , a natural next step would be to use this statistics for studying real physical objects or phenomena like an ideal @xmath0-gas or the quantum hall effect , or statistics of cosmic rays etc .",
