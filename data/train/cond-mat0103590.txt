    "it has been observed that like - charged macromolecules can attract each other in solutions containing multivalent counterions .",
    "this attraction manifests itself in _ in vitro _ formation of toroidal bundles of concentrated dna  @xcite , similar to the one found in bacteriophage heads  @xcite , and the appearance of rodlike bundles of f - actin and tobacco mosaic virus in the presence of multivalent counterions  @xcite .",
    "a number of models have been suggested to explain this curious phenomenon .",
    "the fundamental ingredient in all of these models is the role played by the condensed counterions  @xcite .",
    "thus , the attraction has been attributed to the correlations between the condensed counterions on the two polyions  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical problem of how these correlations can be taken into account is highly non - trivial .",
    "two approaches have been proposed .",
    "one relies on field theoretic methodology and uses what can be classified as a high temperature expansion to account for the correlations between the condensed counterions  @xcite , while the second is a zero temperature approximation , in which the counterions are thought to form correlated wigner crystals on the surfaces of the two polyions  @xcite .",
    "neither one of the approaches is exact , although the zero temperature wigner crystal approximation seems to be better at capturing the true nature of correlations  @xcite .    in a previous work",
    "we have introduced a simple model which has allowed us to study _ exactly _ the force between two parallel charged rods with a layer of condensed counterions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall extend this work to allow for a relative inclination between the two rods .",
    "this problem is of particular interest in kinetics of the bundle formation .",
    "indeed , it has been observed that the bundles of stiff polyions have a characteristic size .",
    "this is quite surprising since the correlation induced attraction should favor the formation of infinitely thick bundles , after all the ionic crystals can grow to macroscopic sizes .",
    "a possible explanation for the bundles not growing beyond some specific size can be found in the kinematics of bundle formation .",
    "the condensed counterions do not fully neutralize the charge of a polyion . for a rodlike polyion formed by @xmath0 @xmath7 charges separated by distance @xmath8 , placed in a solvent with dielectric constant @xmath9 , in the presence of counterions of charge @xmath10 , the manning criterion  @xcite states that the number of condensed counterions on a polyion is @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "thus , for the case of dna with divalent counterions @xmath13 of the dna s charge is neutralized .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that if the interaction between two rodlike molecules is repulsive , there will be a greater probability that they will be found perpendicular to one another .",
    "the correlation induced attraction between the dna molecules is short ranged , what means that the electrostatic repulsion is dominant on large scales .",
    "thus , the two polyions will in general repel one another .",
    "it is only when the two macromolecules come in a close contact that the thermal fluctuations might be able to overcome the free energy barrier between the perpendicular and the parallel configurations , allowing the correlation induced attraction to take over and the polyions to `` bundle up '' .",
    "it has been argued that the size of this free energy barrier scales with the size of the bundle already formed  @xcite .",
    "thus , there comes a point when the thermal fluctuations will not be able to overcome the free energy barrier .",
    "motivated by this discussion we shall now proceed with the study of interactions between rotating like - charged rods .",
    "we consider two rodlike polyions , each one with @xmath0 charges @xmath7 with separation @xmath8 between neighbor charges . on each polyion , @xmath4 @xmath1-valent counterions , with charge @xmath10 , are condensed .",
    "the sites where the condensed counterions are located are described by occupation variables @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 if a counterion is condensed on the @xmath16th monomer ( @xmath17 ) of the @xmath18th polyion ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 otherwise . when a counterion is condensed on a monomer , we assume that the only effect is the renormalization of the local charge , from @xmath7 to @xmath21 .",
    "the rods are located on two parallel planes separated by a distance @xmath22 and the line joining the centers of the rods is supposed to be perpendicular to these planes .",
    "the angle between the directions of the rods is equal to @xmath3 , so that @xmath5 corresponds to the case of parallel rods previously considered  @xcite .",
    "the definitions above are illustrated in fig .",
    "notice that , for simplicity , we will consider only odd values of @xmath0 , so that for nonzero values of @xmath3 the distance between the central charges of each rod vanishes as @xmath23 .",
    "the polyions are placed in a uniform solvent whose dielectric constant is equal to @xmath9 . for a given configuration @xmath24 of condensed counterions the hamiltonian for the pair of polyions",
    "may then be written as @xmath25 where the denominator is the distance between the sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the sum is restricted to @xmath28 , and @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the values of occupation variables obey the constraints @xmath32 .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by @xmath33 where the prime denotes the constraint of fixed numbers of condensed counterions on each polyion .",
    "the adimensional reduced hamiltonian @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the manning parameter @xcite . for a given counterion configuration @xmath37 , if a transformation @xmath38 is performed , the hamiltonian changes as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this relation leads to the following invariance property of the partition function of the model @xmath42",
    "^ 2\\xi,\\alpha/[\\alpha-1],x,\\theta ) , \\label{e7}\\ ] ] and therefore we may restrict ourselves to @xmath43 in the calculations .",
    "the free energy of the model is @xmath44 , and the force between the rods is @xmath45 .",
    "it is then useful to define an adimensional force as @xmath46 it should be stressed that the definition of @xmath47 we use here is different from the one used in @xcite , since the earlier definition diverges at vanishing temperature .",
    "the sign was chosen in such a way that repulsive forces are positive .    to solve the model exactly",
    ", one may define activity variables @xmath48 , i=1,\\ldots , z-1\\\\ z_{ij } & = & \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\xi}{d_{ij}}\\right ] , i , j=1,\\ldots , z , \\label{e9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",

    "it is possible to generate these sets of integer numbers with a computer program and thus obtain the partition function of the model exactly . on a conventional personal computer with a rather moderate processing time it is easy to obtain results up to @xmath55 , and simulations @xcite for larger polyions show that the qualitative behavior of the model does not change much beyond this value , so we will restrict ourselves here to @xmath56 .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the model is determined by the free energy @xmath57 , and we will start considering the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath3 . for convenience ,",
    "we define an adimensional free energy @xmath58 the free energy is a function of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath59 , @xmath1 , @xmath60 , and @xmath3 . for reasons which will become clear below",
    ", we replace the parameter @xmath1 by @xmath61 so that we will consider the free energy @xmath62 . for all cases we noticed that the global minimum of the free energy is located either at the parallel ( @xmath5 ) or at the perpendicular ( @xmath6 ) configuration of the rods .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , and one may note that , in general , the parallel configuration is stable for small distance @xmath60 and the perpendicular one becomes stable as @xmath60 is increased .",
    "so , in what follows we will concentrate our attention on the parallel and perpendicular rod configurations only .",
    "we will now focus on the regions of the parameter space where the parallel and perpendicular configurations are stable .",
    "we will start discussing the behavior of the model at vanishing values of @xmath60 . in this limit",
    ", the partition sum is dominated by the contributions coming from interactions between charges separated by a distance @xmath60 . for the case",
    "@xmath5 we have @xmath0 pairs in this situation .",
    "we may then rewrite the partition function as @xmath63 where @xmath64 vanishes as @xmath65 .",
    "now let us call @xmath66 and let us suppose that the first @xmath67 of the @xmath68 condensed counterion configurations correspond to this value of @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 vanishes as @xmath65 , since @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath67 configurations considered here are the ones that maximize the number of @xmath74 pairs separated by a distance @xmath60 , and thus @xmath75 . for the parallel configuration",
    ", we thus have that at small values of @xmath60 , the partition function is asymptotically given by @xmath76 a simple combinatorial calculation leads to @xmath77    the same line of reasoning may be applied to the perpendicular case , where only the pair of central charges @xmath78/2,1)$ ] and @xmath78/2,2)$ ] is separated by a distance @xmath60 .",

    "[ f3 ] the curve of equal free energies in the plane @xmath87 is shown for the case @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "for all temperatures , the curves meet at @xmath93 , as expected . for the case of the ground state ( vanishing temperature )",
    ", the curve displays discontinuous derivatives at points where the configurations of the ground state change .",
    "another point which is worth observing is that for @xmath94 or @xmath95 the curve starts with _ negative _ inclination at @xmath96 .",
    "thus , for a value of @xmath97 somewhat smaller than @xmath98 the perpendicular configuration is stable at large _ and _ small distances , while parallel rods are stable at intermediate distances .",
    "thus , in this case we find that the perpendicular phase is reentrant as the distance @xmath60 is lowered .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows the initial inclination @xmath99 as a function of @xmath59 for some examples . as is apparent in expression  [ e21 ] , these inclinations diverge as @xmath100 , their sign in this limit being determined by @xmath89 . as a general rule ,",
    "one notices that reentrant behavior is found for relatively small values of @xmath4 in the examples that we have studied ( @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath55 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the behavior of the force defined in equation  [ e8 ] . as a general rule , for sufficiently large values of @xmath97 ,",
    "the force is repulsive at large distances and becomes attractive as the distance is lowered .",
    "it is useful to find the value of the distance @xmath60 for which the forces @xmath104 and @xmath105 vanish .",
    "the behavior of these curves at small distances may be found from the asymptotic behavior of the free energies described in equations [ e17 ] and [ e18 ] .",
    "we find @xmath106 where @xmath107 thus , for small values of @xmath60 , the curve @xmath108 reads @xmath109 so that attractive forces in the parallel configuration are possible only if @xmath110 , since @xmath111 .",
    "for the perpendicular configuration , similar considerations lead to @xmath112 and therefore the curve @xmath113 for @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 for small separations between the rods , the curve @xmath113 , in the @xmath87 plane , tends to @xmath116 . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] the curves @xmath108 , @xmath113 , and @xmath86 are depicted for a particular case .",
    "one notices that for @xmath117 , the force between the rods is attractive for sufficiently small distances @xmath60 and the rods are in the parallel configuration . for @xmath118",
    "the force is still attractive at small @xmath60 , but the rods are in the perpendicular configuration .    the behavior of the force as a function of the distance @xmath60 is shown in fig .  [ f6 ] for @xmath119 . at @xmath120",
    "the force is repulsive and the rods are perpendicular . as the distance",
    "is lowered , the force becomes attractive , with the rods still in the perpendicular configuration . at @xmath121",
    "the rods change to the parallel configuration and the attractive force becomes much larger . at a small distance",
    ", the force displays an asymptotic behavior of the form @xmath122 , according to eq .",
    "[ e22 ] . at @xmath123",
    "the force is repulsive at large distances , with perpendicular rods .",
    "as the distance is lowered , the force changes discontinuously to attractive as the rods become parallel .",
    "finally , an example of the behavior of the force as a function of the temperature @xmath124 may be seen in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . for the values of the parameters used to obtain these data , the parallel configuration is stable . in general , the modulus of the force increases as the temperature is lowered , since the charge correlations grow in this case .",
    "however , at relatively low temperatures and short separations between the polyions , this rule may not apply , as is the case in the example shown .",
    "the reason for this is that the ground state configuration , which corresponds to the lowest electrostatic energy , is not , in general , the configuration which maximizes the attractive force .",
    "for low temperature and short distances there are configurations which have forces more attractive than what is found in the ground state . the total force , being a weighted mean of forces associated with all configurations can , therefore , become more attractive than the force at t=0 .",
    "to get a better understanding of the range of electrostatic correlational forces involved , we study a simple example of two parallel long polyions with @xmath125 condensed divalent counterions . in the ground state",
    "the counterions are distributed periodically along the polyions . at finite temperature , this periodicity will be destroyed , the correlations between the condensed counterions , however , will persist .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large electrostatic coupling , i.e. manning parameter , the electrostatic potential at position ( @xmath126 ) from a polyion can be approximated as , @xmath127 appealing to poisson sum rule the asymptotic large distance behavior or this sum can be evaluated yielding @xmath128 the energy of interaction between two lines of charge with staggered charges is then @xmath129 and the force , @xmath130 , is @xmath131 we see that the correlation induced attraction decays exponentially , with the characteristic range of @xmath132 .",
    "we have studied the electrostatic interaction between two charged rods with a layer of condensed counterions .",
    "this is the simplest model of interaction for like - charged polyions in a polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "it is shown that in spite of the equal net charge on the two macromolecules the correlations between the condensed counterions can produce an effective attraction .",
    "we show , however , that this attraction is of extremely short range , comparable to the monomer separation along the macromolecules .",
    "furthermore , it is found that at large distances the monopolar repulsion between the charge densities forces the polyions into a perpendicular configuration . at short distances",
    "the correlations between the condensed counterions can become sufficient to produce a macromolecular alignment .",
    "the energy barrier associated with the transition from the perpendicular to the parallel configuration might be relevant for the kinematics of bundle formation in solutions of stiff polyelectrolytes  @xcite .",
