    "large-@xmath16 partons or jets are good probes of the dense matter formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , since they are produced in the earliest stage of heavy - ion collisions and their production rates are calculable in perturbative qcd . if a dense partonic matter is formed during the initial stage of a heavy - ion collision with a large volume and a long life time ( relative to the confinement scale @xmath17 ) , the produced large @xmath16 parton will interact with this dense medium and , according to many recent theoretical studies @xcite , will lose its energy via induced radiation . the energy loss is shown to depend on the parton density of the medium . therefore , the study of parton energy loss can shed light on the properties of the dense matter in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is also a crucial test whether there is any thermalization going on in the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "even though one can not measure directly the energy loss suffered by a high energy parton propagating through a dense medium , its effective fragmentation functions must change and leading particles must be suppressed due to the parton energy loss .",
    "this can be measured directly in deeply inelastic @xmath18 collisions ( for jets going through a normal nuclear matter ) @xcite and direct - photon - tagged jets in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "since the large @xmath0 single - inclusive particle spectra in nuclear collisions are a direct consequence of jet fragmentation as in hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions , they are also shown @xcite to be sensitive to parton energy loss or modification of jet fragmentation functions inside a dense medium .",
    "because of the extremely small cross sections of large @xmath0 particle production at the cern sps energy ( @xmath19 gev ) , measurements of particle spectra in heavy - ion collisions at moderately large @xmath0 have not become available before recent experiments @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the author used a qcd parton model calculations to analyze the large @xmath0 spectra and found that there is no evidence of parton energy loss in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . from the analysis of the spectra , one can limit the effective energy loss to less than @xmath20fm . since",
    "experimental data have shown evidences of an interacting hadronic matter in heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps energy , one can also conclude that the hadronic matter dose not cause apparent jet energy loss .    in this paper",
    ", we will conduct a systematic study of high @xmath0 hadron spectra in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 collisions , since the reliability of the determination of a small effective parton energy loss in high - energy heavy - ion collisions crucially depends on the precision to which we understand the spectra without parton energy loss .",
    "we will include both the intrinsic @xmath5 in @xmath1 collisions and @xmath5 broadening due to multiple initial - state scattering in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions in a phenomenological manner , which we find necessary to describe large @xmath0 particle production at energies below @xmath6 gev .",
    "we will then compare the calculations with the experimental data for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 collisions at the cern sps with different centrality cuts and verify the scaling behavior characteristic of hard processes .",
    "using the same parton model we will then predict the high @xmath0 spectra in @xmath22 collisions at the rhic energy and then calculate same spectra in @xmath24 collisions with and without effects of parton energy loss .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a practical and phenomenological description of the high @xmath0 hadron spectra in @xmath1 and @xmath3 collisions .",
    "this will provide a baseline prediction for high - energy @xmath15 collisions against which we can study the effects of the parton energy loss caused by the dense medium .",
    "large @xmath0 particle production in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions has been shown to be a good test of the qcd parton model @xcite . assuming partons inside the colliding hadrons only have longitudinal momenta , the large @xmath0 particle production cross section can be calculated as a convolution of elementary parton - parton scattering cross sections , parton distributions inside the hadron and parton fragmentation functions .",
    "the factorization theorem ensures that the parton distributions and fragmentation functions are universal and can be measured in other hard processes , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath25 annihilation , deeply inelastic @xmath26 collisions . with high precision data , parton distributions and fragmentation functions",
    "have been parameterized including their qcd evolution with the momentum scale @xmath27 of the hard processes @xcite which in turn can be used to calculate particle production in many other hard processes .",
    "this parton model with collinear approximation has been rather successful so far in describing large @xmath0 particle production in high - energy @xmath28 collisions @xcite with @xmath29 gev .",
    "the above described collinear parton model fails to account the experimental data on angular correlation of produced heavy quarks and the total transverse momentum distribution of the heavy quark pairs @xcite or the drell - yan lepton pairs @xcite . in terms of parton models",
    "one naturally expects that partons inside a hadron carry at least an average intrinsic transverse momentum of about a few hundred mev , reflecting the hadron size via the uncertainty principle .",
    "furthermore , higher order pqcd processes like initial state radiation or @xmath30 subprocesses with additional radiated gluons can also give rise to large initial transverse momentum for the colliding partons .",
    "however , even within next leading order ( nlo ) pqcd collinear parton model , experimental data of dell - yan lepton pairs production @xcite , heavy quark pair production @xcite , and direct photon production @xcite all indicate that an average initial parton transverse momentum of about 1 gev is needed to describe the data .",
    "such a large value is an indication of its perturbative nature .",
    "theoretical techniques have been developed to include all high order contributions@xcite , though it is still problematic to differentiate what is true intrinsic and what is pqcd generated initial transverse momentum .",
    "one can re - sum all the radiative corrections into a `` sudakov '' form factor up to a scale @xmath31 and define ( non - perturbative ) contributions below this scale as `` true '' intrinsic , even though such an `` intrinsic '' average transverse momentum still depend on colliding energy @xmath32 and the momentum scale @xmath27 of the hard processes .",
    "such schemes have been developed for processes , such as drell - yan @xcite and heavy quark production @xcite where two scales are involved , with only minimum phenomenological success in limited kinematic region .",
    "the problem in processes such as direct photon and single inclusive hadron production , where there is only a single scale , is even more difficult @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will adopt a more phenomenological approach by introducing initial parton transverse momentum with a gaussian form of distribution as has been done in drell - yan @xcite , heavy quark @xcite , direct photon @xcite and single inclusive hadron production @xcite .",
    "since it is difficult to extend the nlo calculation to @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions where multiple collisions occur and our main purpose is to provide an effective description of single inclusive hadron spectra not only in @xmath1 but also in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions , we will use lowest order ( lo ) parton model with a simple scheme of including the intrinsic transverse momentum with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the inclusion of initial transverse momentum can be considered as a parameterization of both higher order and nonperturbative corrections .",
    "the predictive power of this model then lies in the energy and flavor dependence of the hadron spectra .",
    "similar comments can be made for our modeling of multiple parton scattering effect in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions .",
    "one can define parton distributions in both fractional longitudinal momentum @xmath33 and initial transverse momentum @xmath5 in a factorized form , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the transverse momentum distribution and @xmath36 are the normal parton distribution functions for which we will use the mrs d- parameterization @xcite .",
    "the inclusive particle production cross section in @xmath21 collisions will then be given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fragmentation function of parton @xmath11 into hadron @xmath39 as parameterized in @xcite from @xmath25 data , @xmath40 is the momentum fraction of a parton jet carried by a produced hadron . the @xmath41 (",
    "unless otherwise specified ) factor is used to account for higher order qcd corrections to the jet production cross section @xcite .",
    "we define the momentum fraction @xmath33 in terms of the light - cone variables @xmath42 for partons in the forward beam direction and @xmath43 in the backward beam direction .",
    "the four - vector momenta for the colliding partons are then @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46    in principle , one should also include the transverse momentum smearing from the jet fragmentation .",
    "we neglect this in our calculation of particle spectra in the central rapidity region and consider it been effectively included in the calculation by adjusting the initial @xmath5 distribution . in this case , particles are produced in the same direction of the fragmenting jet .",
    "the mandelstam variables for the elementary parton - parton scattering processes are then , @xmath47 where @xmath0 and @xmath48 are the transverse momentum and rapidity of the produced particle , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . the momentum fraction of the produced hadron @xmath40 is then given by the identity for massless two - body scattering , @xmath51 .    in eq",
    "( [ eq : nch_pp ] ) , one should also restrict the initial transverse momentum @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that the partons longitudinal momenta in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom4 ] ) have the same signs as their parent hadrons .",
    "in addition , one of the mandelstam variables can approach to zero if the initial @xmath5 is too large and then the parton cross section could diverge . to avoid these problems ,",
    "we introduce a regulator @xmath54 in the denominators of the parton - parton cross sections @xmath55 .",
    "we choose @xmath56 gev in our following calculations .",
    "the resultant spectra are sensitive to the choice of @xmath57 only at @xmath0 around @xmath57 where we believe that qcd parton model calculation becomes unreliable .",
    "we assume the initial @xmath5 distribution @xmath58 to have a gaussian form , @xmath59 since our initial @xmath5 includes both the intrinsic and pqcd radiation - generated transverse momentum , the variance in the gaussian distribution @xmath60 should depend on the momentum scale @xmath27 of the hard processes .",
    "as pointed out by owen and kimel @xcite , in addition to the leading log contribution from initial - state radiation that is included in the @xmath61 dependence of the parton distributions , the recoil effect of large - angle gluon emissions can lead to @xmath27-dependent @xmath60 in this approach of qcd parton model . in the following",
    "we shall consider both a constant @xmath60 and one that depends on the momentum scale of the hard processes .",
    "for the @xmath27-dependent case , we choose the following form @xcite in our model @xmath62 the form of the @xmath27-dependence and the parameters are chosen to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "following the same approach as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we choose @xmath61 to be @xmath63 .    shown in figs",
    ".  [ figsps1]-[figsps4 ] are our calculated spectra for charged pions as compared to the experimental data @xcite for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath64200 , 300 , 400 , 800 gev",
    ". as one can see from the figures that qcd parton model calculations with the initial @xmath5 smearing ( solid lines ) as given in eq .",
    "[ kperp ] fit the experimental data very well over all energy range .",
    "however , without the initial @xmath5 smearing ( dot - dashed lines for @xmath65 ) the calculations significantly underestimate the experimental data , as much as a factor of 20 at @xmath66 gev .",
    "this is because the qcd spectra are very steep at low energies and even a small amount of initial @xmath5 could make a big increase to the final spectra .",
    "as the energy increases , the qcd spectra become flatter and small amount of initial @xmath5 does not change the spectra much , as we can already see by comparing the spectra for @xmath67 gev ( fig .",
    "[ figsps4 ] ) to that of 200 gev ( fig .  [ figsps1 ] ) .",
    "this is further demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figsps5 ] where we compare the lo calculation to experimental data in high - energy @xmath68 collisions .",
    "here we have used a @xmath69 factor .",
    "one can see that at higher collider energies , the initial @xmath5 does not make much difference to the spectra at high transverse momentum . in the case of no intrinsic @xmath5 , we did nt use the regulator @xmath57 in our calculation .",
    "instead , we used the @xmath0 of particle as a cut - off of the phase integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nch_pp ] ) .",
    "this is why the spectra ( dot - dashed lines ) increase faster at smaller @xmath0 than the ones with initial @xmath5 smearing in which a regulator of @xmath56 gev is used .    in fig .",
    "[ figsps1 ] , we also show as a dashed line the calculated spectrum of @xmath65 with a constant average initial transverse momentum , @xmath70 gev@xmath71 . at large @xmath0",
    "such a constant intrinsic @xmath60 underestimates the experimental data .",
    "this demonstrates phenomenologically why the @xmath27 dependence of @xmath60 is needed to fit the experiment-    al data in particular at large values of @xmath72 for the choice of @xmath61 we used .",
    "one can also use an alternative choice for @xmath73 . in this case",
    "we found that one does not need @xmath27-dependent @xmath60 to fit the data in @xmath21 collisions .",
    "however , one needs to use an energy - dependent initial parton transverse momentum distribution .",
    "we also checked that as energy increases such a @xmath27-dependent @xmath60 is not needed anymore to fit the experimental data .",
    "however , the available experimental data at collider energies are only limited to finite @xmath0 range where @xmath72 is not so large as compared to the low energy data . in the following",
    "we will use the @xmath27-dependent initial momentum distribution    for our study of high @xmath0 spectra in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions .    in the inserted boxes in figs .",
    "[ figsps1]-[figsps4 ] , we also plot @xmath74 ratio as a function of @xmath0 . at higher @xmath0 , particle production is more dominated by the leading hadrons from valence quark scattering .",
    "since there are more up - quarks than down - quarks in @xmath1 system , one should expect the ratio to become smaller than 1 and decrease with @xmath0 .",
    "the qcd parton model calculations describe this isospin dependence of the spectra very well . for other flavors of hadrons ,",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ figsps5]-[figsps7 ] the calculated kaon spectra at different energies .",
    "we see that the agreement with experimental data is very good , except at large @xmath0 at low energies which may be improved by using better fragmentation functions for kaons .",
    "one can also notice that @xmath75 spectra at large @xmath0 are about a factor of 10 smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "this is because the content of strange quarks in a nucleon is much smaller than up ( down ) quarks which are responsible for leading @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) hadron production .",
    "we did not calculate and compare the spectra of produced protons and anti - protons because there is no very accurate parameterization of the corresponding fragmentation functions .",
    "since single - inclusive particle spectra at high @xmath0 in @xmath3 collisions have been shown , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , to be sensitive to multiple initial - state scattering , or cronin effect , it is important that we take into account this effect here in order to have a quantitative study of the change of particle spectra at high @xmath0 in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "one can study the cronin effect in a model of multiple parton scattering @xcite .",
    "in such a model , one uses glauber multiple scattering formula to treat parton scattering between beam and target partons which is essential to incorporate the interference effect .",
    "for example , when contribution from double scattering is considered , one must also include the absorptive part of the single scattering which has a negative contribution .",
    "this absorptive part then cancels part of the contribution from double scattering .",
    "consequently , the enhancement of particle spectra because of double scattering decreases with @xmath0 in the form of @xmath78 and in general with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "one can also find that the dominant contribution in double scattering comes from the case where one of the scatterings is soft and large part of the final @xmath0 of the produced jet comes from just one hard scattering . at much lower @xmath0",
    "the absorptive correction is much larger than the double scattering contribution and the spectra there is even suppressed .",
    "so the integrated cross section or average particle multiplicity at moderate @xmath0 are not affected by multiple parton scattering even though the spectra are modified , as observed in the dy case @xcite .",
    "this will provide us a justification for our following phenomenological treatment of multiple parton scattering in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions .",
    "in this paper we assume that the inclusive differential cross section for large @xmath0 particle production is still given by a single hard parton - parton scattering . however , due to multiple parton scattering prior to the hard processes , we consider the initial transverse momentum @xmath5 of the beam partons is broadened . assuming that each scattering provide a @xmath5 kick which also has a gaussian distribution",
    ", we can in effect just change the width of the initial @xmath5 distribution .",
    "then the single inclusive particle cross section in minimum - biased @xmath3 collisions is , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the nuclear thickness function normalized to @xmath81 .",
    "we will use wood - saxon form of nuclear distribution for @xmath80 throughout this paper unless specified otherwise .",
    "the parton distribution per nucleon inside the nucleus ( with atomic mass number @xmath82 and charge number @xmath83 ) at an impact parameter @xmath84 , @xmath85 , \\label{eq : shd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is assumed to be factorizable into the parton distribution in a nucleon @xmath36 and the nuclear modification factor @xmath86 which we take the parameterization used in hijing @xcite for now .",
    "the initial parton transverse momentum distribution inside a projectile nucleon going through the target nucleon at an impact parameter @xmath84 is then , @xmath87 with a broadened variance @xmath88 the broadening is assumed to be proportional to the number of scattering @xmath89 the projectile suffers inside the nucleus . for the purpose of considering the impact - parameter dependence of the @xmath5 broadening , we will simply assume a hard sphere nuclear distribution .",
    "therefore , @xmath90 where @xmath91 fm and @xmath92 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "we also assume that @xmath5 broadening during each nucleon - nucleon collision @xmath93 also depends on the hard momentum scale @xmath94 , the transverse momentum of the produced parton jet .",
    "such a dependence is easy to understand by comparing the role of @xmath95 in the multiple parton scattering case to that in the initial and final state radiation associated with a hard jet production .",
    "for example , unless the multiple scatterings are far separated in space - time such that the propagating parton becomes on - shell , the interaction cross of the propagating parton will depend on its virtuality which in return depends on the scale of the hard scattering . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath5 broadening in a multiple parton scattering scenario is related to the ratio of the leading - twist parton distributions and higher - twist multiple parton distributions which apparently depends on the momentum scale of the hard parton scattering . in this paper , we will use the following scale - dependent @xmath5 broadening per nucleon - nucleon collision , @xmath96 such a functional form is chosen to best fit the experimental data in @xmath3 collisions . for @xmath97 gev , @xmath98 gev@xmath99 ,",
    "which is consistent with the value obtained from the analysis of @xmath5 broadening for @xmath100 production in @xmath3 collisions @xcite .",
    "we should point out that this value can be different from what one gets from the analysis of @xmath5 broadening of dell - yan lepton pairs in @xmath3 collisions , where mainly quarks and anti - quarks are involved in the hard processes and there is no collision effect after the dell - yan production point .    using the above assumptions",
    ", we calculate the large @xmath0 particle spectra in @xmath3 collisions and compare to the spectra in @xmath1 collisions . as we show in the last section",
    ", particle spectra has a strong isospin dependence in the parton model . in order to minimize this known isospin dependence of the spectra in our study of nuclear dependence of the spectra",
    ", we compare the spectra of @xmath3 for heavy target with that for a very light nuclear target . shown in fig .",
    "[ figsps9 ] are our calculated ratios of charged pion spectra ( solid lines for @xmath101 and dot - dashed lines for @xmath65 ) in @xmath102 over that of @xmath103 each normalized by the atomic number of the target nucleus .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .  @xcite .",
    "if there was no nuclear dependence due to multiple scattering , the ratios would have a flat value of 1 , modulo the residue isospin dependence because of the small isospin asymmetry of the target nucleus .",
    "the difference between our calculated ratios for @xmath101 and @xmath65 gives the order of this isospin asymmetry effect .",
    "one can get rid of this effect by using the ratios of @xmath104 spectra . as shown in the figure , our model can roughly describe the general feature of the nuclear dependence of the spectra at large @xmath0 due to multiple parton scattering .",
    "the ratios should become smaller than 1 at very small @xmath0 because of the absorptive processes as we have mentioned . but here our perturbative calculation will eventually breaks down because of the small momentum scale . at larger @xmath0 ,",
    "the spectra are enhanced because of multiple parton scattering .",
    "as @xmath0 increases further , the ratios decrease again and saturate at about 1 .",
    "the decrease follows the form of @xmath78 consistent with the general features of high twist processes . since the transverse momentum broadening due to multiple parton scattering is finite",
    ", its effect will eventually become smaller and disappear .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 location of the maximum enhancement can give us the scale of average transverse momentum broadening .",
    "we also show in the third panel as dot - dashed line our calculation with a constant @xmath5 broadening , @xmath105 gev@xmath71 .",
    "while the result has the general feature of the experimental data , the fit is not as good as the scale - dependent @xmath5 broadening .    at low energies , @xmath66 gev for example",
    ", the full structure of multiple scattering can not be revealed because of the finite phase space constrained by the kinetic limit .",
    "furthermore , the ratio will increase at large @xmath72 because of the so - called emc effect @xcite on nuclear structure function at large @xmath33 which is incorporated into the parameterization of the nuclear modification factor for parton distributions inside a nucleus .",
    "one word of caution should also be given here .",
    "our calculation might not be reliable anymore near the boundary of the available phase space ( @xmath106 ) where overall energy and momentum conservation is very important which is not imposed in qcd parton model .",
    "we have also calculated the kaon spectra in @xmath22 collisions .",
    "show in fig .",
    "[ figsps10 ] are the ratios of the kaon spectra in @xmath102 over @xmath103 collisions ( normalized by the atomic number ) .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is quite good for @xmath76 .",
    "however , for @xmath75 there is quite sizable discrepancy between the calculation and the data .",
    "this is might be due to the flavor dependence of the @xmath5 broadening suffered by the quarks .",
    "it is quite possible that @xmath107 quarks have larger scattering cross sections as they propagate through the nucleus and therefore experience larger @xmath5 broadening than @xmath108 quarks .",
    "such effects will result in the observed difference in nuclear enhancement between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is straightforward to incorporate the initial @xmath5 broadening due to multiple parton scattering in @xmath15 collisions .",
    "since partons from projectile and target beam both suffer multiple scattering before the hard process , their initial transverse momentum distributions are broadened as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ga ] ) .",
    "in addition , the produced parton jets have to propagate through a dense medium and interact with other produced particles in the medium .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite show that a fast parton propagating inside a dense partonic medium will suffer considerable amount of energy loss .",
    "since large @xmath0 particles are produced through the fragmentation of parton jets with large transverse energy , parton energy loss will definitely lead to the suppression of large @xmath0 particles .",
    "one can describe this suppression phenomenologically via effective fragmentation functions which are modified from their original forms in the vacuum @xcite . in this approach",
    "one can then calculate the single inclusive particle spectra at large @xmath0 in @xmath4 collisions as , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the modified effective fragmentation function for produced parton @xmath11 which has to travel an average distance @xmath111 inside a dense medium .",
    "we will not elaborate on the modeling of the modified fragmentation functions @xcite here , except pointing out that it depends on two parameters : the energy loss per scattering @xmath112 and the mean free path @xmath113 for a propagating parton @xmath11 .",
    "the energy loss per unit length of distance is then @xmath114 .",
    "we also assume that a gluon s mean free path is half of a quark and then the energy loss @xmath115 is twice that of a quark . in principle , the energy loss @xmath115 should depend on local parton density or temperature , the parton s initial energy , the total distance and whether there is expansion @xcite .",
    "these possible features will influence the final hadron spectra and their phenomenological consequences have been studied in detail in a previous publication @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will simply assume a constant energy loss and study the average effect of parton energy loss in dense matter .",
    "after integration over the impact parameter space , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nch_aa ] ) will give us the inclusive hadron spectra for minimum - biased events of @xmath4 collisions .",
    "if one neglects nuclear effects ( parton shadowing , @xmath5 broadening and jet quenching ) , the resultant spectra should be exactly proportional to @xmath23 which is the averaged number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "very often experimentalists also measure inclusive hadron spectra for certain classes of events with different centrality cuts ( total transverse energy @xmath16 or charged multiplicity in the central region ) .",
    "since one can not directly measure the impact parameters in each class of centrality , a theoretical model of correlation between impact parameter @xmath84 and the total transverse energy @xmath16 ( or charged multiplicity ) has to be introduced in order to calculate the inclusive cross section for events with different centrality cuts . in this paper",
    ", we will use the correlation function @xmath116 [ normalized to @xmath117 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite which assumes a wounded nucleon model for transverse energy production .",

    "this number is just @xmath23 .",
    "since the actual @xmath122 distribution depends on each experiment s coverage of phase space and the detector s calibration , we will choose the values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 so that the fraction of the integrated cross section in eq .",

    "the dashed lines are the spectra in @xmath21 collisions at the same energy multiplied by the nuclear geometrical factor as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : binary ] ) .",
    "the difference between the solid and dashed lines is simply caused by effects of @xmath5 broadening and nuclear modification of parton distributions inside nuclei .",
    "these effects are similar as in @xmath3 collisions and are more important in collisions of heavier nuclei . without these nuclear effects",
    "the high @xmath0 hadron spectra in @xmath4 collisions are exactly proportional to the average number of binary collisions as shown by the dashed lines .",
    "this is a common characteristic of hard processes in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions . because of absorptive processes , low @xmath0 particle production , which can be considered as coherent over the dimension of nuclear size , has much weaker @xmath82-dependence . in the wounded - nucleon model ,",
    "soft particle production cross section is proportional to the average number of wounded nucleons which is much smaller than the number of binary collisions . by studying the transition of the scaling property of the hadron spectra from low to high @xmath0 values",

    "if there is parton energy loss and the radiated gluons become incoherent from the leading parton , the resultant leading hadron spectra at large @xmath0 from the parton fragmentation should be suppressed as compared to @xmath1 and @xmath3 collisions . as we have shown , however , the parton model calculations without parton energy loss fit the experimental data very well . to find out the consequences of an effective parton energy loss in the hadron spectra and how the experimental data constrain its value at the cern sps energy , we show in fig .",
    "[ figsps12 ] as the dot - dashed line the calculated @xmath125 spectra in central @xmath9 collisions with @xmath126 gev / fm . in the calculation ( dot - dashed line )",
    "we have assumed the energy loss per scattering @xmath127 gev and the mean free path @xmath128 fm ( @xmath129 ) . in our model",
    "@xcite , the modification of the fragmentation function is sensitive to both parameters .",
    "the mean free path is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the leading parton and medium while energy loss @xmath115 reflects the degree of attenuation induced by the interaction . shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figsps12 ] is a calculation with the same @xmath130 gev / fm but with a mean free path @xmath131 fm which is about the average total length a parton will travel through in a cylindrical system with a radius of a @xmath132 nucleus .",
    "such a scenario of weak interaction and small energy loss is barely consistent with the systematics of the experimental data .",
    "it is clear that the large @xmath0 spectra in @xmath9 collisions at the cern sps energy can put very stringent limits on the interaction of energetic partons with dense medium and the induced energy loss . within the parton model",
    ", one can exclude from the observed hadron spectra a parton energy loss larger than @xmath130 gev / fm and a mean free path shorter than @xmath131 fm .",
    "this is much smaller than the most conservative estimate of parton energy loss in a dense medium @xcite . according to the most conservative estimate in ref .",
    "@xcite , a quark should still have an energy loss @xmath133 gev / fm in a cold nuclear matter of 10 fm in transverse size .",
    "our constraint is 20 times smaller than this conservative limit , even though the dense matter in @xmath24 collisions should at least consists of hot hadronic matter which is much denser than the normal cold nuclear matter .",
    "there are several implications one can draw from this analysis .",
    "most of the recent theoretical estimates of parton energy loss are based on a scenario of a static and infinitely large dense parton gas .",
    "if the system produced in a central @xmath9 collision only exists for a period of time shorter than the interaction mean free path of the propagating parton , one then should not expect to see any significant parton energy loss .",
    "using the measured transverse energy production @xmath134 405 gev @xcite and a bjorken scaling picture , one can indeed estimate @xcite that the life time of the dense system in central @xmath9 collisions is only about 2  3 fm/@xmath11 before the density drops below a critical value of @xmath135 gev/@xmath136 . even if we assume that a dense partonic system is formed in central @xmath9 collisions ,",
    "this optimistic estimate of the life time of the system could still be smaller than the mean free path of the propagating parton inside the medium .",
    "thus , one does not have to expect a significant effect of parton energy loss on the final hadron spectra at large @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise , it will be difficult to reconcile the absence of parton energy loss with the strong parton interaction which maintains a long - lived partonic system .",
    "another conclusion one can also make is that the dense hadronic matter which has existed for a period of time in the final stage of heavy - ion collisions does not cause any apparent parton energy loss or jet quenching .",
    "a high @xmath0 physical pion from jet fragmentation has a very long formation time .",
    "one does not have to worry about its scattering with other soft hadrons in the system which could cause suppression of high @xmath0 pion spectra .",
    "we still do not understand the reason why a fragmenting parton does not loss much energy when it propagates through a dense hadronic matter .",
    "however , it might be related to the absence of energy loss to the quarks and anti - quarks prior to drell - yan hard processes in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions .",
    "this observation will make jet quenching a better probe of a long - lived partonic matter since one does not have to worry about the complications arising from the hadronic phase of the evolution .",
    "if one observes a dramatic suppression of high @xmath0 hadron spectra at the bnl rhic energy as predicted @xcite , then it will clearly indicate an initial condition very different from what has been reached at the cern sps energy .",
    "as we have seen in the calculation of large @xmath0 particle spectra in @xmath137 collisions , the initial @xmath5 smearing is most important at low energies where the original particle spectra from jet production falls off very rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of @xmath5 broadening due to multiple parton scattering in @xmath3 collisions follows the same line . at higher energies ( @xmath138 gev ) ,",
    "when the original jet spectra become much flatter , the effects of both the initial or intrinsic @xmath5 and nuclear @xmath5 broadening will become smaller , as we can clearly see in both our calculation and the experimental data in figs .",
    "[ figsps8 ] and [ figsps5 ] . at the bnl rhic collider energy , the nuclear enhancement of large @xmath0 spectra",
    "will then become smaller .",
    "shown in fig .",

    "we can see that the enhancement due to multiple parton scattering will not disappear at the rhic energy .",
    "there is still about 2050% enhancement at moderately large @xmath0 around 4 gev/@xmath11 .",
    "it then disappears very quickly at larger @xmath0 .    at the bnl rhic energy , @xmath142 gev , nuclear modification of the gluon distribution",
    "will become important for hadron spectra at moderately large @xmath0 .",
    "such modifications for quark distributions have been measured in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "however , the nuclear effects on the gluon distribution have not been directly measured . in the calculation",
    "shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figsps13 ] we have used a recent parameterization of the nuclear modification factors @xmath143 [ eq .  ( [ eq : shd ] ) ] by eskola , kolhinen and salgado @xcite which is based on global fits to the most recent collection of data available and some model on nuclear modification of gluon distribution . this result is quite different from the calculation using hijing @xcite parameterization . in eks98 parameterization",
    ", qcd evolution equation has been used to take into account the @xmath61 scale dependence of the nuclear modification which is absent in hijing parameterization .",
    "because of qcd evolution , the nuclear shadowing effects at small @xmath33 become smaller with increasing @xmath61 .",
    "this is why the hadron spectrum in @xmath3 collisions using eks parameterization is larger than that using hijing parameterization .",
    "the eks98 parameterization also has a gluon anti - shadowing which is larger than any parameterizations before .",
    "hadron spectra in a moderately large @xmath0 range at the bnl rhic energy mainly come from fragmentation of gluon jets .",
    "this is why the eks98 result in fig .",
    "[ figsps13 ] is larger than that without nuclear modification of parton distributions ( solid line ) in the @xmath0 range where anti - shadowing becomes relevant .",
    "in addition , the impact parameter dependence of the nuclear modification of parton distributions is not implemented in the calculation using eks98 parameterization .",
    "though eks98 parameterization has taken into account information about nuclear shadowing of gluon distribution from the measured scale evolution of the structure functions of different nuclei , such a procedure is also model dependent .",
    "the result will depend on whether one includes the higher gluon - density terms in the qcd evolution equation . before a direct measurement of the nuclear effect on gluon distribution inside a nucleus",
    ", one should consider it one of the uncertainties in predicting the hadron spectra in @xmath3 collisions at the bnl rhic energy .    as pointed out in sec .",
    "ii , the shape of the nuclear modification of hadron spectra at large @xmath0 is a result of multiple parton scattering inside a nucleus and their corresponding absorptive corrections .",
    "the shape is remarkably similar to the nuclear modification of parton distributions .",
    "in fact , nuclear modification of parton distributions in small @xmath33 region ( shadowing and anti - shadowing ) can be explained in a multiple scattering model @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could have double counted the same effect if he includes both the cronin effect ( or @xmath5 broadening ) and nuclear modification of the parton distributions in the calculation of hadron spectra in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "given these uncertainties , it is therefore extremely important to have a systematic study of @xmath3 collisions at the bnl rhic energy . such an effort is pivotal to unravel any other effects in the hadron spectra caused by the formation of dense partonic matter in @xmath15 collisions .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ figsps14 ] are predictions for the ratio of hadron spectra in central @xmath144 collisions over that in @xmath1 [ as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) ] , with and without parton energy loss . in both cases , uncertainties in the nuclear modification of parton distributions",
    "are still important .",
    "if there is significant parton energy loss in the dense medium at the bnl rhic energy , leading hadrons from jets which are produced in the center of a overlapped region will be suppressed . as we can see",
    "this is where the cronin effect and the effect of nuclear modification of parton distributions are the strongest .",
    "this is why the relative uncertainty caused by nuclear parton distributions is reduced compared to the case when there is no parton energy loss . in the calculations",
    ", we also included possible contribution to hadron production from soft processes at low @xmath0 as implemented in ref .",
    "when hadrons from hard parton scattering are suppressed , these soft contributions might become dominant at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "this is why the spectra ratio increases again when @xmath145 gev/@xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ figsps14 ] .",
    "the spectra at lower @xmath0 could also be broadened due to the rescattering effect which also drives the system into local equilibrium .",
    "we should emphasize that the soft particle spectra we use here are extremely schematic and qualitative .",
    "this is another uncertainty one should keep in mind which could affect the shape of spectra at intermediate @xmath0 . nevertheless , the spectra at moderately large @xmath0 is most sensitive to parton energy loss in dense medium .",
    "therefore , one should study hadron spectra in @xmath3 very carefully and pin down the uncertainty due to multiple scattering and parton ( anti)shadowing as much as possible . only then one can draw more accurate conclusions about parton energy loss from the single inclusive hadron spectra in heavy - ion collisions at the bnl rhic energy .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed systematically large @xmath0 hadron spectra in @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions from cern sps to bnl rhic energies within a qcd parton model .",
    "we found that both the initial @xmath5 in @xmath1 collisions and the @xmath5 broadening due to multiple parton scattering in @xmath3 collisions are important to describe the experimental data within the parton model calculations .",
    "the value of initial @xmath5 in order to fit the data is found to be larger than the conventional value of @xmath146 mev for intrinsic @xmath5 according to the uncertainty principle .",
    "this finding is also consistent with analysis of drell - yan data @xcite and recent study @xcite of direct photon and pion production at around cern sps energy range . in both studies",
    ", one found that an intrinsic @xmath5 of the order of 1 gev/@xmath11 is needed to describe the data within nlo parton model calculations . since we only used lo pqcd calculation",
    ", we have to introduce some @xmath61 dependence of the initial @xmath5 induced by initial - state radiation processes in order to fit the experimental data at low collider energies . this parton model with phenomenologically included intrinsic @xmath5 describes very well the energy and isospin dependence of the hadron spectra .",
    "the parton model calculation can also describe the large @xmath0 pion spectra in heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps energies very well , both the @xmath82 or centrality and energy dependence .",
    "there is no evidence of proposed parton energy loss caused by dense partonic matter .",
    "based on recent theoretical estimates @xcite of parton energy loss in dense partonic matter , one should expect a parton energy loss in the order of @xmath147 gev / fm .",
    "the absence of such energy loss in large @xmath0 hadron spectra implies that either there is no such dense partonic matter formed or the life time of such medium is smaller then the mean free path of the parton interaction inside such a medium .",
    "it also tells us that the hadronic matter which must have existed for a period of time in heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps will not cause apparent energy loss or jet quenching effect .",
    "therefore , if one observes suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons at the bnl rhic energy , it will unambiguously reflect an initial condition very different from what has been achieved at the cern sps .",
    "as pointed out in a recent paper by gyulassy and levai @xcite , even though hijing @xcite monte carlo model fails to reproduce the hadron spectra in @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 ) data at the cern sps energy , it accidentally reproduces the central @xmath9 data very well because some unique form of transverse momentum kick introduced in hijing to the end - points of strings each time they suffer an interaction . a hydrodynamic model calculation @xcite with significant transverse expansion can also be used to fit the high @xmath0 hadron spectra .",
    "so one should wonder how one can make sure that the high @xmath0 hadron production in @xmath4 collisions is indeed dominated by hard parton scattering .",
    "as we have proposed earlier @xcite , measurement of two - particle correlation in azimuthal angle in the transverse plane should be able to distinguish these models from parton model . in the parton model ,",
    "jets are always produced in pairs and back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "high @xmath0 particles from jet fragmentation should then have strong back - to - back correlation",
    ". neither hydro - dynamical model nor multiple scattering of string end - points can give such correlation .",
    "if such correlation is seen , one can then study the @xmath0 dependence of the correlation to find out at what @xmath0 value the correlation disappears .",
    "one can then at least quantify above what @xmath0 value thermal - hydro model can be ruled out as the underlying particle production mechanism .",
    "such a study is underway and will be reported elsewhere .    at the bnl rhic energy",
    ", things will become a little cleaner .",
    "as pointed out by gyulassy and levai @xcite , most of hadron production at moderate @xmath0 will be dominated by gluon production and are not influenced by the fate of strings or valence quarks ( except net baryons ) .",
    "the spectra should be more sensitive to parton energy loss .",
    "moreover , the hadron spectra in @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions without parton energy loss will have a unique shape similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ figsps13 ] at high energies which can not be fully revealed at the cern sps energies .",
    "this unique shape will be hard to explain by any thermal - hydrodynamic models .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated in the previous section , there are still some uncertainties related to nuclear modification of parton distributions .",
    "it is therefore very important to have a systematic study of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath15 collisions at the bnl rhic energy in order to make more quantitative conclusions about parton energy loss in dense medium from the single hadron spectra at moderately high @xmath0 .",
