    "the discovery of the cosmic acceleration @xcite and the search for dark energy responsible for its origin @xcite have stimulated the study of different field models driving the cosmological evolution .",
    "such a study usually is called the potential reconstruction @xcite , because the most typical examples of these models are those with a scalar field , whose potential should be found to provide a given dynamics of the universe . in the flat friedmann models with a single scalar field ,",
    "the form of the potential and the time dependence of the scalar field are uniquely determined by the evolution of the hubble variable ( up to a shift of the scalar field ) . during last years",
    "the models with two scalar fields have also become very popular .",
    "this is connected with the fact that some observations point out that the relation between the pressure and the energy density could be less than -1 @xcite .",
    "such equation of state arises if the matter is represented by a scalar field with a negative kinetic term .",
    "this field is called `` phantom '' @xcite . moreover , according to some observations @xcite the universe undergoes a transition between normal and phantom phase .",
    "such an effect is dubbed `` phantom divide line crossing '' @xcite . in principle , the effect of phantom divide line crossing can be explained in the model with the only scalar field provided a special form of the potential and initial conditions is chosen @xcite or in models with a non - minimally coupled scalar field @xcite .",
    "however , the models with two scalar fields , one standard and one phantom , look more `` natural '' for the description of the phantom divide line crossing @xcite .    in our preceding paper @xcite",
    "we have studied the procedure of reconstruction of the potential in two - field models .",
    "it was shown that there exists a huge variety of potentials and time dependences of the fields realizing the same cosmological evolution .",
    "some concrete examples were considered , corresponding to the evolution beginning with the standard big bang singularity and ending in the big rip singularity @xcite .",
    "one can ask oneself : what is the sense of studying different potentials and scalar field dynamics if they imply the same cosmological evolution ?",
    "the point is that the scalar and phantom field can interact with other fields and influence not only the global cosmological evolution but also other observable quantities .",
    "one of the possible effects of the presence of normal and phantom fields could be their influence on the dynamics of cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "the problem of the origin and of possible amplification of cosmic magnetic fields is widely discussed in the literature @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the origin of such fields can be attributed to primordial quantum fluctuations @xcite and their further evolution can be influenced by hypothetic interaction with pseudoscalar fields breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the evolution of magnetic fields created as a result of quantum fluctuations , undergoing the inflationary period with unbroken conformal invariance and beginning the interaction with pseudoscalar or pseudophantom fields after exiting the inflation and entering the big bang expansion stage , which is a part of the bang - to - rip scenario described in the preceding paper @xcite .",
    "we shall use different field realizations of this scenario and shall see how the dynamics of the field with negative parity influences the dynamics of cosmic magnetic fields . to our knowledge the possible influence of the two - field dynamics , ( when one of two ( pseudo)scalar fields is a phantom one ) on the magnetic fields was not yet discussed in the literature .",
    "speaking of cosmic magentic fields we mean the large - scale galactic , intergalactic or super - cluster magnetic fields of order from @xmath0 to @xmath1 with correlation from 100 kpc to several mpc to the extent that they are originated from scalar and , possibly gauge field fluctuations after exiting the inflation .",
    "their seeds may well have @xmath2 or less ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .  2 we recall the bang - to - rip scenario and describe some examples of different dynamics of scalar and phantom fields ; in sec .",
    "3 we introduce the interaction of the fields ( phantom or normal ) with an electromagnetic field and write down the corresponding equations of motion ; in sec .",
    "4 we describe the numerical simulations of the evolution of magnetic fields and present the results of these simulations ; sec .",
    "5 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "we shall consider a spatially flat friedmann universe with the metric @xmath3 here the spatial distance element @xmath4 refers to the so called comoving coordinates .",
    "the physical distance is obtained by multiplying @xmath4 by the cosmological radius @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to consider the cosmological evolution characterized by the following time dependence of the hubble variable @xmath6 , where `` dot '' denotes the differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath7 : @xmath8 this scenario could be called `` bang - to - rip '' @xcite because it is obvious that at small values of @xmath7 the universe expands according to power law : @xmath9 while at @xmath10 the hubble variable explodes and one encounters the typical big rip type singularity .",
    "( the factor one third in ( [ btr ] ) was chosen for calculation simplicity ) . in our preceding paper @xcite ) we considered a class of two - field cosmological models , where one field was a standard scalar field @xmath11 , while the other was a phantom one @xmath12 .",
    "the energy density of the system of these two interacting fields is @xmath13 analyzing the friedmann equation and @xmath14 . in this system",
    "the planck mass @xmath15 , the planck length @xmath16 and the planck time @xmath17 are equal to @xmath18 .",
    "then when we need to make the transition to the `` normal '' , say , cgs units , we should simply express the planck units in terms of the cgs units . in all that follows",
    "we tacitly assume that all our units are normalized by the proper planck units .",
    "thus , the scalar field entering as an argument into the dimensionless expressions should be divided by the factor @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20    we have shown that in contrast to models with one scalar field , there is huge variety of potentials @xmath21 realizing a given evolution . moreover , besides the freedom in the choice of the potential , one can choose different dynamics of the fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 realizing the given evolution .",
    "we have studied in @xcite some particular exactly solvable examples of forms of potentials and time dependences of fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 providing the evolution ( [ btr ] ) . here",
    "we shall present and apply some of them .",
    "consider the potential  . ]",
    "@xmath24 and the fields @xmath25 @xmath26 ( here the expressions for the fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 should be multiplied by @xmath27 . for the relation between planck units and cgs ones",
    "see e.g. @xcite if we would like to substitute one of these two fields by the pseudoscalar field , conserving the correct parity of the potential , we can choose only the field @xmath11 because the potential @xmath28 is even with respect to @xmath11 , but not with respect to @xmath12 . in what follows",
    "we shall call the model with the potential ( [ v - i ] ) , the pseudoscalar field ( [ phi1 ] ) and the scalar phantom ( [ xi1 ] ) `` model  @xmath29 '' .    consider another potential @xmath30 with the fields @xmath31 @xmath32 this potential is even with respect to the field @xmath12 .",
    "hence our model @xmath33 is based on the potential ( [ v - ii ] ) , the pseudophantom field ( [ xi - new3 ] ) and the scalar field ( [ phi - new3 ] ) .",
    "they will be the fields with the negative parity which couple to the magnetic field .",
    "the action of an electromagnetic field interacting with a pseudoscalar or pseudophantom field @xmath11 is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an interaction constant and the dual electromagnetic tensor @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 with the standard levi - civita symbol @xmath39},\\ \\epsilon_{0123 } = + 1 .",
    "\\label{lc}\\ ] ]    variating the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the field @xmath40 we obtain the field equations @xmath41 @xmath42 the klein - gordon equation for the pseudoscalar field is    @xmath43    the klein - gordon equation for the pseudophantom field ( which is the one that couples with the magnetic field in the model @xmath33 ) differs from equation ( [ kg ] ) by change of sign in front of the kinetic term . in what follows",
    "we shall neglect the influence of magnetic fields on the cosmological evolution , i.e. we will discard the electromagnetic coupling in equation ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "if one wants to rewrite these formulae in terms of the three - dimensional quantities ( i.e. the electric and magnetic fields ) one can find the expression of the electromagnetic tensor in a generic curved background , starting from a locally flat reference frame  in which it is well known the relation between electromagnetic fields and @xmath44  and using a coordinate transformation .",
    "it is easy to see that we have , for the metric ( [ friedmann ] ) : @xmath45 the field equations ( [ maxwell ] ) , ( [ maxwell1 ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) rewritten in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 become @xmath48 @xmath49 , \\label{maxwell3}\\ ] ] @xmath50 @xmath51 for a spatially homogeneous pseudoscalar field equations ( [ maxwell2 ] ) and ( [ maxwell3 ] ) look like @xmath52 @xmath53taking the curl of ( [ maxwell7 ] ) and substituting into it the value of @xmath46 from ( [ maxwell4 ] ) we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 stands for the three - dimensional euclidean laplacian operator .",
    "let us introduce @xmath56 and its fourier transform @xmath57 here the field @xmath47 is an observable magnetic field entering into the expression for the lorentz force .",
    "the field equation for @xmath58 is @xmath59 f(\\vec{k},t)=0 , \\label{max - four}\\ ] ] where `` dot '' means the time derivative .",
    "this last equation can be further simplified : assuming @xmath60 and defining the functions @xmath61 one arrives to @xmath62f_{\\pm}=0 , \\label{max - four1}\\ ] ] where we have omitted the arguments @xmath63 and @xmath7 .",
    "assuming that the electromagnetic field has a quantum origin ( as all the fields in the cosmology of the early universe @xcite ) the modes of this field are represented by harmonic oscillators . considering their vacuum fluctuations responsible for their birth we can neglect the small breakdown of the conformal symmetry and treat them as free .",
    "in conformal coordinates @xmath64 such that the friedmann metric has the form @xmath65 the electromagnetic potential @xmath66 with the gauge choice @xmath67 , @xmath68 satisfies the standard harmonic oscillator equation of motion @xmath69 hence the initial amplitude of the field @xmath66 behaves as @xmath70 , while the initial amplitude of the functions @xmath44 is @xmath71 .",
    "the evolution of the field @xmath44 during the inflationary period was described in @xcite , where it was shown that the growing solution at the end of inflation is amplified by some factor depending on the intensity of the interaction between the pseudoscalar field and magnetic field .",
    "here we are interested in the evolution of the magnetic field interacting with the pseudoscalar field after inflation , where our hypothetic bang - to - rip scenario takes place .",
    "more precisely , we would like to see how different types of scalar - pseudoscalar potentials and field dynamics providing the same cosmological evolution could be distinguished by their influence on the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "we do not take into account the breaking of the conformal invariance during the inflationary stage and all the effects connected with this breakdown will be revealed only after the end of inflation and the beginning of the bang - to - rip evolution .",
    "this beginning is such that the value of the hubble parameter , characterizing this evolution is equal to that of the inflation , i.e. @xmath72 in turn , this implies that we begin evolution at the time moment of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "we shall consider both the components @xmath74 and @xmath75 and we shall dwell on the scenarios @xmath29 and @xmath33 described in the preceding section . anyway , our assumption regarding the initial conditions for equation ( [ max - four1 ] ) can be easily modified in order to account for the previous possible amplification of primordial magnetic fields as was discussed by @xcite .",
    "thus , all estimates for the numerical values of the magnetic fields in today s universe should be multiplied by some factor corresponding to the amplification of the magnetic field during the inflationary stage .",
    "hence , our results refer more to differences between various models of a post inflationary evolution than of the real present values of magnetic fields , whose amplification might be also combined effect of different mechanism @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the results of numerical simulations , for the two models @xmath29 and @xmath33 introduced in sec .  2 . in our models , the equation of motion for the modes @xmath76 ( [ max - four1 ] ) reads , where today - time is taken to be near the crossing of the phantom divide line , i.e. at @xmath77 .",
    "this implies in turn that at the beginning of the `` bang - to - rip '' evolution the cosmological radius is @xmath78 . ] : @xmath79f_{\\pm}=0 , \\label{edm}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 stands for the scalar field @xmath11 in the model  @xmath29 and for the phantom @xmath12 in the model  @xmath33 , so that @xmath81    equation ( [ edm ] ) is solved for different values of the wave number @xmath63 and the coupling parameter @xmath35 .",
    "( the parameter @xmath35 has the dimensionality inverse with respect to that of the scalar field ; the wave number @xmath63 has the dimensionality of inverse length ; the time @xmath82 ) .",
    "qualitatively we remark that in ( [ max - four1 ] ) the coupling term influence becomes negligible after some critical period .",
    "after that the magnetic fields in our different scenarios evolve as if the parameter @xmath35 in ( [ max - four1 ] ) had been put equal to zero .",
    "indeed , it can be easily seen that the interaction term vanishes with the growth of the cosmological radius @xmath83 .",
    "then the distinction between the two models is to be searched in the early time behavior of the field evolution .    noting that in both our models @xmath29 and @xmath33 the time derivative @xmath84 is positive , by inspection of the linear term in equation ( [ max - four1 ] ) we expect the amplification to be mainly given for the mode @xmath75 provided the positive sign for @xmath35 is chosen",
    "; so we will restrict our attention on @xmath75 .",
    "we can also argue that the relative strength of the last two terms in the left - hand side of ( [ edm ] ) is crucial for determining the behavior of the solution : when the coupling term prevails ( we remark that we are talking about @xmath85 so this term is _ negative _ in our models ) then we expect an amplification , while when the first term dominates we expect an oscillatory behavior . for future reference",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath86 which is just the ratio between the last two terms in the left - hand side of equation  ( [ edm ] ) .",
    "indeed our numerical simulations confirm these predictions .",
    "let us consider the model @xmath29 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath16 is the planck length .",
    "such a value of the wave number @xmath63 corresponds to the wave length of @xmath89 at the present moment .",
    "we obtain an early - time amplification of about 2 orders of magnitude , with the subsequent oscillatory decay .",
    "notice that the parameter @xmath90 in this model at the beginning is very small : this corresponds to the dominance of the term proportional to @xmath84 and , hence , to the amplification of the field @xmath75 . at the time scale of the order of @xmath91 , where @xmath17 is the planck time",
    ", this regime turns to that with big values of @xmath90 where the influence of the term proportional to @xmath84 is negligible .    for",

    "it can be easily seen that at a time scale of order @xmath91 the ratio becomes greater than 1 . ]",
    "( given in planck units ) in model @xmath29 with the parameter choice @xmath92 , @xmath88 .",
    "the behavior , as said above in the text , consists in an amplification till a time of order @xmath91 , after which the oscillations begin . ]",

    "the behavior , consists in an amplification till a time of order @xmath94 , after which the oscillations begin . ]    in figure  [ mag1 ] we present the time dependence of the function @xmath90 for the model @xmath29 for the values of @xmath92 and @xmath88 chosen above .",
    "the figure  [ mag2 ] manifests the amplification of the magnetic field in the model  @xmath29 .",
    "naturally the effect of amplification of the magnetic field grows with the coupling constant @xmath35 and diminishes when the wave number @xmath63 increases . in figure  [ mag3 ]",
    "we display the results for the case of @xmath95 , which is admittedly extreme and possibly non realistic , but good for illustrative purposes . here",
    "the amplification is more evident and extends for a longer time period .",
    "let us try to make some estimates of the cosmic magnetic fields in the universe today , using the correlation functions .",
    "the correlation function for the variable @xmath44 is defined as the quantum vacuum average @xmath96 and can be rewritten as @xmath97 integrating over the angles , we come to @xmath98 to estimate the integral ( [ corr2 ] ) we notice that the main contribution to it comes from the region where @xmath99 ( see e.g.@xcite ) and it is of order @xmath100 where @xmath101 . in this estimation",
    "the amplification factor is @xmath102 where the subscript @xmath103 is not present since we have taken the trace over polarizations .",
    "now we are in a position to give numerical values for the magnetic fields at different scales in the model @xmath29 for different values of the coupling parameter @xmath35 .",
    "these values ( see table  [ tab ] ) correspond to three values of the coupling parameter @xmath35 ( 1,10 and 100 @xmath104 ) less than 1 make the effect of the coupling of the magnetic field with the pseudoscalar field negligible . ] and to two spatial scales @xmath105 determined by the values of the wave number @xmath63 . we do not impose some physical restrictions on the value of @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see that the increase of @xmath35 implies the growth of the value of the magnetic field @xmath106 .",
    "we also shall consider a rather large value of the wave number @xmath63 corresponding to the physical wavelength @xmath107 pc at the present moment when @xmath108 . while this scale looks too small for the description of large - scale cosmic magentic fields , we use it for illustrative purposes to underline the strong dependence of the amplification of magnetic field on the corresponing wavelength values .",
    "let us stress once again that we ignored the effects of amplification of the magnetic fields during inflation to focus on seizable effects during evolution .",
    "@lccc & @xmath109&@xmath110 & @xmath111 + & & & + @xmath112&@xmath113&@xmath114&@xmath115 + & & & + @xmath116&@xmath117&@xmath118&@xmath119 +    [ tab ]    finally notice that our quantum `` initial '' conditions correspond to physical magnetic fields which for presented values of @xmath63 are @xmath120 is equal to @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "we have seen that the evolution of the cosmic magnetic fields interacting with a pseudoscalar ( pseudophantom ) field is quite sensitive to the concrete form of the dynamics of this field in two - field models where different scalar field dynamics and potentials realize the same cosmological evolution .",
    "we confirm the sensitivity of the evolution of the magnetic field with respect to its helicity given the sign of the coupling constant @xmath35 and that the @xmath80 is a monotonic function of time ( as it is really so in our models ) .",
    "we give also some numerical estimates of the actual magnetic fields up to the factor of amplification of such fields during the inflationary period .",
    "the toy model of the bang - to - rip evolution studied in this paper , can not be regarded as the only responsible for the amplification of cosmic magnetic fields implying their present observable values .",
    "it rather complements some other mechanisms acting before .",
    "however , the difference between cosmic magnetic fields arising in various models ( giving the same expansion law after the inflation ) is essential . it may provide a discriminating test for such models",
    "naturally , the influence of the interaction between a pseudoscalar ( phantom ) field and a cosmic magnetic field on the dynamics of the latter depends on the velocity of change with time of the former .",
    "the larger is the time derivative of the pseudoscalar field , the more intensive is the growth of the magnetic field ( remember that the evolution of the scalar field is monotonic ) .",
    "the results of numerical calculations illustrated in sec .",
    "4 confirm these qualitative considerations .",
    "moreover , one can see that there exists a certain range of values of the wave number @xmath63 ( and hence of the corresponding wavelengths of the magnetic field ) where the effect is stronger .",
    "indeed , if @xmath63 is too small the interaction term is small as well and the evolution of the magnetic field is damped . on the other hand",
    "if the wave number @xmath63 is too large the interaction term is small compared to the oscillatory term , proportional as usual to @xmath125 and the evolution has practically oscillatory character .",
    "thus , the study of interplay between the dynamics of global scalar fields providing the cosmological evolution and the magnetic fields looks promising .",
    "this interplay has another interesting aspect .",
    "the pseudoscalar - electromagnetic field interaction can imply a conversion of the photons into axions .",
    "such an effect can cause the observable dimming of supenovae .",
    "while it was shown @xcite that this effect can not mimic the cosmic acceleration , it could nevertheless mimic the dark energy fluid with a phantom equation of state @xcite .",
    "thus , the interrelation amongst an electromagnetic field , a scalar and a phantom field can reveal some surprises .",
