    "the low - lying neutral excited - state hyperons @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 were discovered in the 1960s , but their quark wave functions are still not well - understood and experimental studies of their properties have been scarce since the early 1980s .",
    "the electromagnetic decays of baryons produced in photon reactions provide an especially clean method of probing their wave functions . baryons with a strange quark have an additional degree of freedom which aids in the study of multiplet mixing and non 3-quark admixtures .",
    "recently there has been a renewal of interest in this field , e.g. electro - production of the @xmath1@xcite .",
    "this paper reports the results of a non - model dependent measurement of the radiative decay of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the non - relativistic quark model ( nrqm ) of isgur and karl@xcite has been remarkably successful in predicting the masses and widths of @xmath8 and @xmath9 states , but less successful in the strange sector .",
    "several competing models for hyperon wave functions have been proposed . measuring the transitions @xmath10 and @xmath11 provides a means of differentiating between these models .",
    "calculations have been done in the framework of nrqm@xcite , a relativized constituent quark model ( rcqm)@xcite , a chiral constituent quark model ( @xmath12cqm ) that includes electromagnetic exchange currents between the quarks@xcite , the mit bag model@xcite , the chiral bag model@xcite , the bound - state soliton model@xcite , a three - flavor generalization of the skyrme model that uses the collective approach instead of the bound - state approach@xcite , an algebraic model of hadron structure@xcite , heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath12pt)@xcite , and the @xmath13 expansion of qcd@xcite .",
    "the radiative widths in kev are tabulated in table [ widths ] .",
    "the @xmath14 width is included for comparison .    the photon decay spectrum of the low - lying excited state hyperons is shown in fig .",
    "[ hierarch ] .",
    "the widths given in table [ widths ] can be qualitatively estimated using su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 are in the s=@xmath17 su(3 ) octet and the @xmath18 is in the s=@xmath19 su(3 ) decuplet .",
    "the @xmath15 has the two light quarks in the s orbital in a spin s=0 , isospin t=0 configuration .",
    "the @xmath16 and the @xmath0 have the light quarks in a spin s=1 , t=1 configuration .",
    "all three hyperons have the strange quark in the s orbital .",
    "decuplet to octet radiative decays are dominated by an m1 transition with a spin - flip of one quark .",
    "the su(3 ) model prediction of the ratio @xmath20 to the @xmath21 is @xmath22 times kinematic factors .",
    "this , plus the fact that most of the constituent quark model calculations@xcite listed in table [ widths ] used the impulse approximation , leads to a very narrow range of predictions , ( 265273 kev ) for the @xmath23 reaction and ( 17.423 kev ) for the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath1 have light quarks in the s orbital with s=0 , t=0 and the strange quark in a p@xmath24 and p@xmath25 orbital respectively .",
    "the radiative decays @xmath26 and @xmath27 require that the strange quark make a transition from a p orbital to an s orbital with a simultaneous spin flip of one of the light quarks .",
    "these transitions are thus forbidden by the one body nature of the electromagnetic operator .",
    "they can proceed only via configuration mixing introduced by , _",
    "e.g. _ the qcd hyperfine interaction , which leads to a wider range of model predictions .",
    "this is explained in more detail in an excellent review of the experimental and theoretical situation in @xcite .",
    "we add the 11% relative error ( i.e. @xmath280.17% absolute ) that could result from underestimating the tail of the @xmath29 response to the negative systematic error and quote a branching ratio of @xmath30% .",
    "the positive systematic error reflects the range of values we obtained for the various estimates for the branching ratio .",
    "if we neglect the small ( unmeasured ) contribution due to the @xmath31 channel , the @xmath32 partial width is given by @xmath33 using @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 , the branching ratio of the @xmath36 channels relative to the @xmath37 channel@xcite .",
    "the errors on @xmath38 and @xmath39 are included in the systematic error for @xmath40 .",
    "if we use the largest theoretical estimate for the @xmath31 channel relative to the @xmath41 channel of 0.153 from r.  bijker , f.  iachello , and a.  leviatan@xcite , the partial width is reduced to 478 kev , which is an insignificant change .    for the @xmath1 decay , we obtained a branching ratio of @xmath42% using the @xmath43 channel and @xmath44% using the @xmath45 channel .",
    "the weighted average gives a branching ratio of @xmath46 table [ chi2_cuts ] lists the branching ratios for various combinations of kinematic fitting @xmath47 cuts .",
    "there is no obvious dependence on the choice of cuts . to determine the systematic error in the measurement using the @xmath43 channel to normalize",
    ", we used the range of branching ratio values obtained for different choices of @xmath47 cuts . using a full width of 15.6@xmath481 mev@xcite",
    ", we obtain a partial width of @xmath6 kev .",
    "the error on the full width is included in the systematic error for @xmath40 .",

    "result@xcite but disagrees with the bertini _ et al . _",

    "the @xmath32 channel has never been measured before .",
    "the result is roughly 23 times larger than all of the existing model predictions except for hb@xmath12pt@xcite .",
    "table [ widths ] reveals that the model predictions for the @xmath49 transition are also about 50% low .",
    "sato and lee@xcite showed that much of that discrepancy could be accounted for by the inclusion of non - resonant meson - exchange effects .",
    "they find a width of 530@xmath4845 kev , about 80% of the experimental value .",
    "et al._@xcite reproduced the @xmath49 data using a chiral bag model calculation with a relatively small bag radius of 0.7 fm .",
    "about 40% of the transition was due to the pion cloud .",
    "these calculations suggest that mesonic effects could account for the discrepancy between the model predictions and our result for the @xmath0 radiative transition .",
