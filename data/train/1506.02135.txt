    "studying the co - evolution of star - formation and black - hole accretion is one of main scientific goals of the space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ( spica ) .",
    "spica will be equipped with two main instruments : the spica far infrared instrument ( safari ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the spica mid - infrared instrument ( smi ) . in @xcite",
    "we have presented detailed predictions for the number counts and the redshift distributions of galaxies detectable in blind spectroscopic surveys with safari , accounting for both the starburst and the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) components . here",
    "we focus on the smi .",
    "the smi has two basic observing modes : the wide - field imaging camera mode and the spectrometer mode with two detectors ( spec - s and spec - l ; * ? ? ?",
    "the technical specifications for the smi used in this work are : r=1000 spectrometers , @xmath12 , wavelength ranges @xmath13 m ( spec - s ) and @xmath14 m ( spec - l ) ; r=20 wide field camera , @xmath15 , wavelength range @xmath16 m . the spatial resolution ( fwhm ) varies from @xmath17 at @xmath18 m to @xmath19 at @xmath20 m .",
    "the line detection limit ( 1hr , @xmath2 ) is in the range @xmath21 for the camera , @xmath22 for the spec - s and @xmath23 for the spec - l .",
    "the point source continuum sensitivity ( 1hr , @xmath2 ) in a low background region increases from @xmath24jy at @xmath18 m to @xmath25jy at @xmath20 m ; at @xmath11 m it is @xmath26jy .",
    "the survey speed for the @xmath2 detection of a point source with a continuum flux density of @xmath27jy with the camera is @xmath28/hr ; for the detection of the line flux of @xmath29 it is @xmath30/h for spec - s and @xmath31/h for spec - l .",
    "the smi instrument is crucial to enhance the outcomes of the spectroscopic surveys carried out with safari .",
    "the @xmath32 spectrometer is needed to observe fine structure lines with a resolution similar to safari , whereas the @xmath33 wide field camera is essential to uncover star - forming galaxies in the four broad and very bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) bands at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath0 m .",
    "the lines that will be detected can come either from star forming regions or from nuclear activity or from both .",
    "the smi spectroscopy will allow us to exploit the rich suite of mir diagnostic lines to trace the star formation and the accretion onto the super - massive black holes up to high redshifts through both blind spectroscopic surveys and pointed observations .",
    "the mir lines detectable by the smi provide excellent diagnostics of the gas density and of the hardness of the exciting radiation field .",
    "the ratios of two lines having similar critical density and different ionization potential allow us to estimate the ionization of the gas , while the ratios of two lines with different critical density and similar ionization potential provide estimates of the gas density in the region @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of infrared density indicators is given by @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , mid - ir line ratio diagrams can be used to identify composite sources and to distinguish between emission from star forming regions and emission excited by nuclear activity .",
    "these diagnostic diagrams are constructed by plotting pairs of line ratios against each other ( for example [ nevi]7.63/[oiv]25.89 and [ nevi]7.63/[neii]12.81 ) , in which different types of regions can be easily separated and distinguished .",
    "similar diagnostic diagrams with different sets of weaker lines have been proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of possible combinations of lines allows us to adapt these diagnostic tools to different redshift ranges . in this respect ,",
    "the complementary wavelength coverages of smi and safari substantially enhances the potential of the spica mission .",
    "the smi camera will also substantially improve our knowledge of source counts in the mid - infrared ( mir ) region by extending them to much fainter flux density levels than achieved by _",
    "spitzer _ and reaching a much better statistics .",
    "this allows a considerable improvement of our understanding of the cosmic star formation history .    in this paper",
    "we use the @xcite evolutionary model as upgraded by @xcite .",
    "the model deals in a self consistent way with the emission of galaxies as a whole , including both the starburst and the agn component , and was successfully tested against a large amount of observational data .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section[sect",
    ": evol ] we briefly summarize the adopted model for the evolution with cosmic time of the ir ( 8 - 1000@xmath0 m ) luminosity function .",
    "in section[sect : imaging ] we discuss imaging observations with the wide field smi camera . in section[sect : line_vs_ir ] we present the relations between line and continuum luminosity for the main mir lines . in section[sect : lf ] we work out our predictions for line luminosity functions , number counts and redshift distributions within the smi wavelength coverage . in section[sect : survey ] we discuss possible smi observational strategies .",
    "section[sect : concl ] contains a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath34 cosmology with matter density @xmath35 , dark energy density @xmath36 and hubble constant @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model , adopted here , is based on a comprehensive `` hybrid '' approach that combines a physical model for the progenitors of the spheroidal components of galaxies ( early - type s and massive bulges of late - type s ) with a phenomenological one for disk components .",
    "the evolution of the former population is described by an updated version of the physical model by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also lapi et al .",
    "2006 , 2011 ) . in the local universe",
    "these objects are composed of relatively old stellar populations with mass - weighted ages @xmath389gyr , corresponding to formation redshifts @xmath391.5 , while the disc components of spirals and the irregular galaxies are characterized by significantly younger stellar populations ( cf .",
    "* their fig.10 ) .",
    "thus the progenitors of spheroidal galactic components , referred to as proto - spheroidal galaxies or `` proto - spheroids '' , are the dominant star forming population at @xmath40 , while ir galaxies at @xmath41 are mostly galaxy disks . in the case of proto - spheroids , the model describes the co - evolution of the stellar and of the agn component , allowing us to deal straightforwardly with objects as a whole .",
    "this does not happen for disk components of late - type galaxies , whose evolution is described by a phenomenological , parametric model , distinguishing between the two sub - populations of `` cold '' ( normal ) and `` warm '' ( starburst ) galaxies .",
    "agns are treated as a separate population .",
    "following @xcite , we have associated them to the late - type galaxy populations using the @xcite correlation between star formation rate ( sfr ) and black hole accretion rate .",
    "both type 1 and type 2 agns , with relative abundances , as a function of luminosity , derived by @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) are taken into account .",
    "the @xcite correlation does not apply to bright optically selected qsos , which have high accretion rates but are hosted by galaxies with sfrs ranging from very low to moderate . as in @xcite",
    "we reckon with these objects adopting the best fit evolutionary model by @xcite up to @xmath42 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this approach reproduces the observationally determined bolometric luminosity functions of agns at different redshifts . at higher redshifts optical agns",
    "are already accounted for by the @xcite model which also accounts for redshift - dependent agn bolometric luminosity functions .",
    "the smi camera can substantially extend the mid - ir flux density range observed so far ( by the _ spitzer _",
    "satellite ) . using the counts yielded by the model , that are strongly constrained by observational data",
    "( see the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : intcounts_photometry ] ) , we find a @xmath11 m @xmath2 confusion limit of @xmath43mjy . for comparison , the deepest _ spitzer _",
    "surveys reached @xmath44jy using an extraction technique based on prior source positions at @xmath45 m @xcite ; the completeness of the resulting catalog , estimated via monte carlo simulations to be 80% , is however difficult to assess . as illustrated by fig .",
    "5 of @xcite at fluxes lower than @xmath46mjy the @xmath11 m counts are endowed with substantial uncertainties due either to poor statistics or to substantial corrections for incompleteness .    with the current technical specifications ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : intro ] ) , reaching a @xmath2 limit of @xmath47jy , i.e. going at least one order of magnitude deeper than _ spitzer _ , requires @xmath48h per fov .",
    "observations of a single fov ( @xmath8 ) will be enough to detect hundreds of sources per 0.1 dex in flux density .",
    "a survey at this limit would resolve @xmath49 of the background estimated using the adopted model .",
    "a determination of the source counts over a very broad flux density interval can be achieved adding a shallow survey with a detection limit of @xmath50mjy , an integration time of @xmath51h per fov , covering an area of @xmath6 .",
    "the global observing time ( without overheads ) is then @xmath52h .",
    "not surprisingly , the deep survey would be very costly of time .",
    "is there a sufficient scientific motivation for it , given that the @xmath11 m counts are found to be rapidly converging already at much brighter flux density levels ?",
    "the simplest answer is that fully exploiting the potential of a new instrument that provides a large boost in sensitivity is a must since it is the most direct way for exploring the unknown , looking for the unexpected . on top of that , in this case going deeper guarantees important information on a still poorly understood aspect of galaxy evolution : the effect of feedback on the star formation history of low mass galaxies at high redshifts , hence also on the build up of larger galaxies via mergers .",
    "it is generally agreed that the flatter slope of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function compared to that of the halo mass function is due feedback , but how the feedback operates is still unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "various flavors of feedback have been advocated , including re - ionization , supernova explosions , tidal stripping and more , but the role of each effect is not well understood . the high surface density reached by the deep survey ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : intcounts_photometry ] ) implies that it will detect low mass galaxies , with low sfrs at substantial redshifts , as discussed at the end of this section .",
    "thus it will provide direct information on a key aspect of galaxy evolution .",

    "[ fig : intcounts_photometry ] shows the predicted integral counts at 24@xmath0 m of galaxies as a whole ( starburst plus agn component ; solid blue lines ) and of the agns alone ( dotted violet lines ) .",
    "the proposed surveys are expected to detect @xmath53 galaxies and @xmath54 agns ( shallow survey ) , and @xmath55 galaxies and @xmath56 agns ( deep survey ) .",
    "interestingly , the surface density of agns detected by the deep survey is essentially the same as that of the deepest chandra survey ( 4 million seconds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in x - rays .",
    "the mid - ir agn counts are crucial , among other things , to assess the abundance of heavily absorbed agns , missed by x - ray surveys , that can contribute an important fraction of the high - energy x - ray background .",
    "figure  [ fig : detections ] shows the number of predicted detections of galaxies and agns in @xmath57 bins ( @xmath58 for agns in the case of the deep survey ) .",
    "below 0.2mjy , where observational data are largely absent ( see fig .  [",

    "the error bars plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : detections ] include both the poisson fluctuations and the contribution from the sampling variance .",
    "the latter is due to the field - to - field variations arising from source clustering and is important especially in the case of surveys covering small areas .",
    "the total fractional variance of the differential counts , @xmath66 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean count in the flux density bin , @xmath70 is the angle between the solid angle elements @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the angular correlation function and the integrals are over the solid angle , @xmath74 , covered by the survey .    the angular correlation function of the faint sources detectable by the smi camera is not known .",

    "this is a significant , although minor , contribution to the error budget for the proposed deep survey . for the shallow survey ,",
    "the contribution due to the sampling variance is negligible .",

    "* only for 9.7@xmath0 m silicate band ) , excluding the objects with low @xmath149 m pah equivalent widths ( @xmath150 m ) whose mir emission is likely to be substantially contaminated by an agn , and the starburst dominated galaxies from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite catalogues ( these authors actually provide optical depths , @xmath151 ) .",
    "as illustrated by fig.[fig : cal_silicate_sb ] , the 9.7@xmath0 m strength of starburst galaxies shows a clear linear anti - correlation with the log of the ir ( 8 - 1000@xmath0 m ) luminosity , consistent with a constant @xmath152 with a mean value @xmath153 and dispersion of @xmath154 .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient is @xmath155 , corresponding to a correlation significant at the @xmath156 level .",
    "the very few data on the 18.0@xmath0 m strength do not show any significant correlation with @xmath91 .",
    "however , given the poor statistics , the possibility of a correlation can not be ruled out either . if , in analogy to the 9.7@xmath0 m strength , we assume also for the 18.0@xmath0 m one a relation of the form @xmath157 we get @xmath158 with a dispersion of @xmath159 .",
    "if , instead , the two quantities are uncorrelated the data give @xmath160 with a dispersion of 0.11 . in the latter case ,",
    "the number of galaxies detectable in that band by the spica smi spectrometers in 1hour integration per fov decreases by a factor @xmath161 .    for agns",
    "we have used the @xcite sample , neglecting the silicate absorption for type1 s and the emission for type2 s . as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : cal_silicate_agn ] the silicate strengths of agns appear to be uncorrelated with the bolometric luminosities .",
    "we have therefore adopted gaussian distributions of @xmath162 around mean values , @xmath163 , independent of @xmath164 .",
    "we have obtained : @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 with dispersions of 0.14 , 0.24 , 0.05 , and 0.12 , respectively .",
    "the line luminosity functions have been computed starting from the redshift - dependent ir luminosity functions given by the evolutionary model , including both the starburst and the agn component . to properly take into account the dispersion in the relationships between line and continuum luminosities we have used the monte carlo approach described in @xcite .",
    "examples of line luminosity functions at various redshifts are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lf_agn_mis ] and [ fig : lf_tot_mis ] .",
    "our predictions for the integral counts in both the spec - s and the spec - l channels , for 30 lines are shown in fig .  [",

    ", the spec - s will detect @xmath169 agn lines per square degree , primarily the [ nev]@xmath170 m line ( @xmath171 of detections ) ; the spec - l will detect mostly the [ oiv]@xmath172 m line ( over 90% of the @xmath169 agn line detections ) .",
    "the @xmath3 lines are produced by @xmath173 individual agns .",
    "only a handful of them are optically selected .",
    "thus this survey will be very efficient at selecting obscured agns , complementing optical surveys .",
    "figure  [ fig : intcounts_spica ] shows the contributions of agns associated with different galaxy populations to the smi spec - s and spec - l counts in six agn lines .",
    "the redshift distributions of agns detected in each of these lines in 1h integration / fov are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : redshiftdistr_spica ] . for three of the lines ( [ nev]14.32 , [ nev]24.31 and [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m ) we also show , for comparison , the redshift distributions obtained by @xcite for a spica / safari survey ( again for a 1h exposure per fov ) .",
    "the two instruments cover nicely complementary redshift intervals .",
    "figure  [ fig : multiple_mis ] illustrates the redshift distributions of sources for which the smi spectrometers will detect at least 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 lines in 1h integration per fov over an area of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding numbers of detected lines are about 53,000 , 16,000 , 3,100 , 360 , 55 and 8 , respectively .",
    "sources detected in at least one line include @xmath174 strongly lensed galaxies at @xmath175 .",
    "note that the @xmath2 detection of only one line does not necessarily imply that the redshift determination is problematic .",
    "many of the objects detected in only one line can show a suite of weak but measurable features ( other lines , absorptions , pah bumps ) .",
    "the global _ pattern _ can then allow the determination of reliable redshifts even when individual features are only significant at the 2@xmath176 level .",
    "some multiple line detections can be due to different galaxies seen by chance within the same resolution element .",
    "we have estimated this confusion effect adopting a typical fwhm of @xmath177 and assuming a random galaxy distribution ( negligible clustering effects )",
    ". the fractions of two line detections due to confusion by the smi camera and by the smi spectrometers are shown as a function of the integration time per fov in fig .",
    "[ fig : confusion_lines ] .",
    "the confused fraction is always small ( in particular in the case of smi spectrometers ) .",
    "for example , with an integration time of 1hr two line detections due to confusion are @xmath178 ( for the camera survey ) and @xmath179 ( for the spectrometers ) .",
    "the number of confusion cases grows almost linearly with the integration time .",
    "therefore the confused fraction grows as we go to fainter fluxes , where the number counts are flatter , but it is still only @xmath180 ( camera ) and @xmath181 ( spectrometers ) for an integration time of 10h per fov .",
    "the difference between the agn and the galaxy seds in the smi range implies that the equivalent widths ( eqws ) of the brightest spectral lines excited by star formation are useful indicators of the agn contribution .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : eqws ] which shows the variation of the eqws of the most prominent star formation lines ( @xmath182 ) with the fractional agn contribution to the total ( starburst plus agn ) @xmath183(8 - 1000@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the pah lines are particularly effective for this purpose .",
    "as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : intcounts_spica_all_spec ] , the integral counts for both smi spectrometers have a slope flatter than 2 at and below the detection limit for 1h integration / fov for the majority of the lines .",
    "counts of pah lines with the smi camera show a similar behaviour ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intcounts_spica_all_wfc ] ) .",
    "this means that the number of detections for a fixed observing time generally increases more by extending the survey area than by going deeper , similarly to what found by @xcite for blind spectroscopic surveys with spica / safari .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sect : lf ] , we expect that a survey of @xmath1 with 1h integration / fov will detect @xmath173 agns . therefore , to investigate the agn evolution with sufficient statistics we need a much wider - area .",
    "also , the blind smi spectroscopic survey may be usefully complemented by follow - up observations of bright high-@xmath184 galaxies already discovered at ( sub-)mm wavelengths over much larger areas .",
    "figure  [ fig : strategy ] shows the smi spectrometer exposure time per fov needed to achieve a @xmath185 detection of typical agn lines at @xmath186 and @xmath187 as a function of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we can see , for example , that the [ nev]14.32@xmath132 m line can be detected in 10h from an agn with ( real or apparent , i.e. boosted by strong gravitational lensing ) bolometric luminosity of @xmath188 at @xmath186 and @xmath189 at @xmath187 . when the south pole telescope ( spt ) and the _ herschel _ survey data will be fully available we will have samples of many hundreds of galaxies with either intrinsic or apparent ir luminosities larger than @xmath190 @xcite . as explained in @xcite , pointed observations of those sources can allow us to investigate early phases of the galaxy / agn co - evolution .",
    "we have worked out predictions for surveys with the smi wide field camera and with the spectrometers .",
    "the combination of a shallow and of a deep survey with the camera , requiring a total observing time of @xmath191h , will allow an accurate definition of mir source counts of both galaxies and agns over about five decades in flux density , down to @xmath192jy , i.e. more than one order of magnitude fainter than the deepest _ spitzer _",
    "surveys at @xmath11 m .",
    "this amounts to resolving almost entirely the mir extragalactic background .",
    "the spectral resolution of the camera is optimally suited to detect pah lines , yielding redshift measurements .",
    "the redshift information will allow us to derive the sfr function down to sfrs hundreds of times lower than was possible using _ herschel _ surveys and well below the sfrs of typical star - forming galaxies .",
    "the cosmic dust obscured star formation history will then be accurately determined at least up to @xmath193 .    on the spectroscopic side",
    "we have considered 41 mir lines , 6 of which are predominantly excited by agn activity while the others are primarily associated with star formation .",
    "relationships between the line luminosity and the ir ( for the starburst component ) and/or the bolometric luminosity ( for the agn component ) are presented .",
    "several of them were derived in previous papers , but many are new .    using these relationships we computed the expected number counts for the 30 brightest lines .",
    "we found that the smi spectrometers will detect , with an integration time of 1h / fov , about 52,000 galaxies per square degree in at least one line and about 16,000 in at least two lines .",
    "about 200 of galaxies detected in at least one line will be strongly lensed .",
    "the number of expected agn detections is far lower .",
    "for the same integration time ( 1h / fov ) we expect to detect , per square degree , @xmath3 agn lines , from @xmath173 agns .",
    "thus a larger area is necessary to investigate the agn evolution with good statistics .    given the low surface density of agns detectable by the smi spectrometers , an efficient way to investigate early phases of the galaxy / agn co - evolution are pointed observations of the brightest galaxies detected by large area surveys such as those by _ herschel _ and by the spt .",
