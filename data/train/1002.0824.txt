    "nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) are found at the centers of a majority of galaxies with milky way mass and below @xcite .",
    "these nscs have similar sizes to globular clusters ( @xmath85  pc ) , but are much more luminous and massive @xcite .",
    "their morphology is often complicated and their star formation history is typically extended ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the relationship of nscs to supermassive black holes ( bhs ) typically found at the centers of more luminous galaxies is not clear .",
    "nscs and supermassive bhs co - exist in some galaxies @xcite , and both have masses that scale with the mass and dispersion of the galaxy they live in ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . unlike bhs ,",
    "the histories of nscs are recorded in their morphology , kinematics , and stellar populations , making them excellent tools to study how mass accumulates at the centers of galaxies .",
    "we are conducting an ongoing survey of the nearest nscs , observing a sample of 13 galaxies within 5  mpc . by resolving the kinematics and stellar populations in these nscs",
    ", we can understand how they formed and constrain the masses of any bhs within them .",
    "their proximity makes them among the most promising objects for detecting intermediate mass bhs , constraining the low mass end of the bh - galaxy scaling relations and the occupation fraction of low mass galaxies . because the bhs in these galaxies are likely to not have undergone much subsequent evolution , measuring their properties is one of the only ways of constraining the initial formation mechanism of supermassive bhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are obtaining adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy on the entire sample using gemini / nifs ( pi : seth ) and vlt / sinfoni ( pi : neumayer ) .",
    "in addition , we are obtaining low resolution optical spectroscopy to examine the stellar populations in the nucleus and hst imaging to constrain their morphology .",
    "our first published results @xcite , show a flattened multi - component nsc with strong rotation in the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc  4244 .",
    "this nsc must have formed from repeated accretion of material from the disk of the host galaxy , a scenario tested in simulations by markus hartmann ( this volume ) .",
    "10% is at ages @xmath910  myr .",
    "residuals are about 1% .",

    "we now focus on the nsc formation and possible intermediate mass bh in ngc  404 , the nearest s0 galaxy ( d=3.1  mpc ) .",
    "the galaxy is nearly face - on and has a total mass of about @xmath10  m@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "ngc  404 also hosts the nearest liner nucleus , although whether this observed activity is actually the result of an accreting bh is a matter of some contention .",

    "[ aseth_nscfig ] ) can be decomposed into three distinct components each with distinct kinematics and stellar populations .",
    "the bulge of the galaxy has a mass of @xmath13  m@xmath11 and dominates the light profile outside the central arcsecond ( 15  pc ) .",
    "optical spectra of the stellar populations of this component show that it is dominated by old stars with ages @xmath145  gyr .",
    "the nuclear star cluster dominates the light in the central arcsecond and has a half - light radius of 10  pc and a dynamical mass of @xmath15  m@xmath11 , larger than expected from nsc scaling relations .",
    "its optical spectrum is dominated by the light of stars with age of 1 - 3  gyr , with stellar population synthesis fits suggesting that over half the mass of the cluster was formed during this period .",
    "the cluster shows mild rotation in the same direction as hi gas at larger radii in the galaxy @xcite , which has been suggested to have a merger origin .",
    "finally , within the central 0.2  , the central excess of emission seen in the surface - brigthtness profile , is also found to be counter - rotating relative to the nsc .",
    "the emission of this component probably results from a combination of young ( @xmath16100  myr ) stars , hot dust emission and perhaps agn continuum .",
    "the nuclear star cluster in ngc  404 appears to have a quite different formation from the episodic disk accretion seen in ngc  4244 .",
    "the burst of star formation @xmath81  gyr ago is suggestive of a merger origin , a scenario that is also consistent with the difference in rotation between the central excess and nuclear star cluster .",

    "it uses the @xmath24 from the stellar dynamical model and finds the disk inclination and bh mass that best match the h@xmath19 kinematics .",

    "the dynamical models constrain the mass of the possible bh to be smaller than any previously dynamically measured bh and below several bulge mass scaling relations .",
