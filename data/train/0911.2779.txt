    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in layered pnictide - oxide quaternary compounds @xmath0o@xmath5@xmath6 ( @xmath0 = lanthinides , @xmath5 = fe , ni , @xmath6 = p , as ) has sparked enormous interest in this class of materials@xcite . besides this 1111-type layered compounds , superconductivity was subsequently discovered in other iron - based layered compounds with similar feas(se ) layers , i.e. , 122 systems@xcite , 111 systems@xcite , and 11 systems@xcite . in all the feas - based parent compounds ,",
    "there is a structural phase transition in the temperature range 100 - 200 k , and a stripe - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering associated with fe ions accompanying the structural transition@xcite .",
    "various chemical doping approaches can suppress the structural transition and afm order , and high-@xmath7 superconductivity consequently appears .",
    "meanwhile , low-@xmath7 superconductivity has been observed in undoped fep - based @xcite and nias(p)-based@xcite compounds with similar layered structure , but there is neither structural transition nor afm ordering associated with fe(ni ) ions in these compounds .",
    "this result implies that there is a relationship between structural transition / afm ordering and high-@xmath7 superconductivity . theoretically , the origin of the afm order is still controversial .",
    "there are two different physical pictures .",
    "one suggests that the afm order is a spin density wave ( sdw ) which is driven by fermi surface nesting between the electron pockets at m point and hole pockets at @xmath8 point based on band structural calculations@xcite .",
    "the other suggests that the afm order stems from the short range magnetic exchange coupling between local moments@xcite .",
    "however , regardless of the origin of the afm ordering , the theories suggest that the superconductivity is tied to the magnetism in the feas - based materials@xcite .",
    "the investigation on the structural properties and afm ordering of the parent compounds can shed light on the mechanism of high-@xmath7 superconductivity .",
    "the structural and magnetic transitions in the feas - based parent compounds are deeply connected .",
    "for the first discovered 1111 type systems , neutron scattering studies on the @xmath0feaso ( @xmath0 = la , ce , nd , and sm ) samples have found that the structural phase transition occurs first as temperature decreases , and then magnetic ordering associated with fe ions follows@xcite , in contrast to the case in 122-type systems where both structural transition and afm order occur at the same temperature@xcite .",
    "recent report on isotope effect also shows positive isotope effect on both @xmath7 and afm ordering temperature@xcite .",
    "some theoretic studies proposed that the structural transition is directly driven by the afm order@xcite . in particular ,",
    "a theory based on a heisenberg - type local moment exchange model suggests that the structural transition can be driven by a nematic ising magnetic order due to the presence of intrinsic magnetic frustration @xcite .",
    "the theory@xcite predicts that the difference between the structural and magnetic transition temperatures is controlled by the magnetic coupling between layers : the difference becomes larger when the coupling is weakened .",
    "recent neutron experiment results in 4% ni - doped bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 have supported this prediction@xcite .    in this paper , we report the investigation of structural phase transition detected by means of low - temperature x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) in the parent compounds lafeaso , smfeaso , gdfeaso , and tbfeaso .",
    "the afm order temperatures associated with fe ions ( @xmath1 ) and the afm ordering temperatures ( @xmath10 ) associated with the magnetic rare earths sm , gd and tb are also obtained by measuring magnetic susceptibility and transport properties .",
    "a systematic comparison of the structural transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath1 is made .",
    "as @xmath0 is changed from la , through sm and gd , to tb , both the @xmath2-axis and @xmath3-axis lattice constants decrease significantly .",
    "meanwhile both @xmath4 and @xmath1 decrease monotonously .",
    "it is also found that the temperature gap ( @xmath11 ) becomes smaller when the distance between feas layers becomes shorter .",
    "therefore , our experimental results provide concrete evidence supporting the theory proposed in ref.@xcite and suggest the dimensionality may have important effect on the afm ordering and on the superconductivity mechanism as well .",
    "the polycrystalline @xmath0feaso ( @xmath0 = la , sm , gd , tb ) samples were synthesized by solid state reaction in vacuum using powders of @xmath0as , @xmath12o@xmath13 ( for tbfeaso , tb@xmath14o@xmath15 was used instead ) , feas and fe@xmath9as .",
    "@xmath0as was presynthesized by reacting stoichiometric @xmath0 pieces and as powders in evacuated quartz tubes at 1223 k for 24 hours .",
    "feas and fe@xmath9as were prepared by reacting stoichiometric fe powders and as powders at 1023 k for 20 hours .",
    "the powders of these intermediate materials were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio of @xmath0feaso respectively , and then thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar .",
    "the mixtures were pressed into pellets under a pressure of 4000 kg/@xmath16 .",
    "all the processes were operated in a glove box filled with high - purity argon .",
    "the pellets were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes and heated uniformly at 1433 - 1453 k for 40 hours .",
    "the sample purity was first checked by measurements of powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) at room temperature using a d / max - ra diffractometer with cu k@xmath17 radiation and a graphite monochromator .",
    "low temperature x - ray diffraction ( ltxrd ) measurements for powder specimens were performed using the rint 2500 system , rigaku co. an x - ray beam was generated by a rotating cu anode .",
    "the specimens were cooled by a @xmath18he gas circulating cryo - cooler and can be cooled down to about 10 k. the temperature stability is better than 0.1% during the ltxrd measurements . at several temperatures",
    "entire profiles of reflection peaks were measured with a step size of 0.01and a step - counting time of 6 s and refined by the rietveld method using the reported crystal structure . for some reflection planes x - ray diffraction measurements with a step size of 0.005and a step - counting time of 60 s",
    "were performed to accumulate more counts at certain temperatures . from the observed profile the @xmath19 value of ( 220 ) peak , the integrated intensity ( @xmath20 ) and also the full - width - at - half - maximum ( @xmath21 ) were obtained . in these analysis",
    "the profile was fitted to a pseudo - voigt function .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured by a standard four - terminal method .",
    "the samples for transport property measurements were cut into a thin bar .",
    "the temperature dependence of d.c .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured on a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 ) under magnetic field of 1000 oe .",
    "1(a ) shows the room - temperature xrd patterns of @xmath0feaso ( @xmath0 = la , sm , gd , tb ) samples and fig.1(b ) shows the variations of lattice constants @xmath3 and @xmath2 with the radius of @xmath0 ions .",
    "for all the four parent compounds , the xrd peaks can be well indexed based on a tetragonal cell with the space group of p4/@xmath22 ( no . 129 ) , which indicates that the samples are in a uniform single phase without obvious trace of impurity phases . as @xmath0 is changed from la to sm , gd , and then tb , all the peaks shift to larger * 2@xmath23 s * significantly , implying a remarkable shrinkage of lattice in both @xmath3-axis and @xmath2-axis directions .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the radius of @xmath0 ions decreases gradually as @xmath0 goes from the light to heavy rare earth elements@xcite .",
    "it can also be found from fig.1(b ) that the @xmath2-axis shrinks slightly more quickly than the @xmath3 axis does .",

    "2 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for the @xmath0feaso samples .",
    "the resistivity starts to drop around 120 - 150 k. to show the drop position more precisely , we calculated the derivative @xmath24 versus @xmath25 as shown in the inset of fig.2 .",
    "the resistivity for lafeaso shows an upturn at low temperatures , but it remains metallic for @xmath0feaso with @xmath0 = sm , gd , and tb .",
    "similar resistivity has been observed in other 1111-type parent compounds with magnetic rare earth elements@xcite .",
    "such a difference in low temperature resistivity has not been well understood yet .",
    "we define the characterization temperature @xmath1 as the peak position in the curves of @xmath24 versus @xmath25 .",
    "as shown in the inset , @xmath1 decreases significantly as @xmath0 is changed from la to sm , gd , and tb .",
    "neutron studies have confirmed that the resistivity anomaly is caused by the structural phase transition and the following formation of antiferromagnetic sdw state@xcite .",
    "previous reports have proposed that the peak position in @xmath24 corresponds to the afm ordering of fe ions moments rather than the structural phase transition@xcite .",
    "indeed , the studies of neutron diffraction reported that the afm ordering temperature of lafeaso is about 135 k , about 20 k lower than the structural phase transition temperature @xmath4 of 158 k@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 value of laofeas determined from the resistivity is 132 k , consistent with the afm order temperature reported by the neutron diffraction .",
    "the afm order temperature determined from the measurements of mssbauer spectroscopy and @xmath26sr relaxation is also in agreement with @xmath1 , the peak temperature in the @xmath24 versus @xmath25 curves@xcite .",
    "thus we can regard @xmath1 as the characteristic temperature at which the magnetic moments of fe ions become afm ordered .",
    "for @xmath0 = sm , gd , and tb , @xmath1 is 133 k , 128 k , and 122 k , respectively .",

    "inset : enlarged plot for smfeaso to show the kink around the afm ordering temperature ( @xmath1 ) of fe ions . ]    in order to obtain more information about the magnetism associated with fe ions and @xmath27 ions as @xmath0 is magnetic rare earth elements other than la , the magnetic susceptibility of @xmath0feaso ( @xmath0 = sm , gd , tb ) was measured under the magnetic field of 1000 oe , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "from the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and its inset , it can been found that the gdfeaso and tbfeaso have much larger magnetic susceptibility compared to smfeaso because gd@xmath31 and tb@xmath31 ions have much larger magnetic moments . at low temperatures , clear phase transitions caused by the afm ordering of the magnetic moments of @xmath0 ions can be found at @xmath10 .",
    "the afm order temperature of @xmath0 ions , i.e. , @xmath10 determined in our measurements , is 5.56 k , 4.11 k , and 2.54 k for smfeaso , gdfeaso , and tbfeaso , respectively , consistent with previous reports@xcite .",
    "for smfeaso , as shown in the inset of fig.3(b ) , a kink associated with the afm ordering of fe ions can be observed around 134 k , consistent with the @xmath1 value of 133 k within the experimental error . for gdfeaso and tbfeaso",
    ", this kind of afm order associated with fe ions is buried in the large magnetic signals from the @xmath27 ions .",
    "the magnetic contributions from the @xmath27 ions obey the curie - weiss law very well . as shown in the fig.3(b ) , the inverse of @xmath30 increases strictly linearly with @xmath25 as @xmath32 . for the smfeaso sample , the magnetic susceptibility does not exhibit the cuire - weiss behavior because the contribution from the fe ions which is linearly dependent on temperature is comparable to the contribution from the sm@xmath31 ions@xcite . by fitting the curie - weiss law",
    ", we obtained that the effective magnetic moments @xmath33 are 8.0 , and 9.7 @xmath34 for gdfeaso and tbfeaso respectively , which are consistent with the theoretical values of magnetic moments of free gd@xmath31 and tb@xmath31 ions .",
    "if we subtract the curie - weiss term which should originate from the contributions of @xmath27 ions , we can also find a slight drop in the subtracted term ( @xmath35 ) around @xmath25 of 120 - 140 k for gdfeaso and tbfeaso ( not shown here ) , where @xmath36 is the cuire - weiss fitting function .",
    "but it is very hard to distinguish whether such a drop in @xmath35 occurs at the afm order temperature of fe ions or the structural phase transition temperature .",
    "therefore , we will take @xmath1 as the transition temperature associated with the afm order of fe ions .",
    "as mentioned above , the neutron studies@xcite have revealed that a structural phase transition occurs just before the afm ordering in lafeaso .",
    "it is generally believed that the structure of the parent compounds @xmath0feaso transforms from tetragonal to orthorhombic when the temperature is lower than the structural transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "such a structure phase transition can be detected by the splitting of ( 220 ) peak in the low temperature x - ray diffraction .",
    "4 shows the temperature dependence of the ( 220 ) peak @xmath19 value for @xmath0feaso samples .",
    "the inset shows the intensity of ( 220 ) peak before and after the structural phase transition .",
    "it can be seen that the ( 220 ) peak splits into two peaks when the temperature is lower than the structural phase transition temperature . from the temperature dependence of ( 220 )",
    "peak @xmath19-value , the structural phase transition temperature @xmath4 can be easily determined as the splitting point of this peak .",
    "as @xmath0 changes from la to tb , the ( 220 ) peak @xmath19 value decreases significantly , and @xmath4 decreases as well .",
    "value for lafeaso ( a ) , smfeaso ( b ) , gdfeaso ( c ) and tbfeaso ( d ) .",
    "the insets show the intensity of ( 220 ) peak before ( blue lines ) and after ( red lines ) structure phase transition . ]",
    "we summarize the variations of the structural phase transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) and afm ordering temperature ( @xmath1 ) in fig .",
    "the structural and physical parameters for these four parent compounds are also listed in table i. as @xmath0 is changed from la , through sm and gd , to tb , not only @xmath4 and @xmath1 decrease significantly , but the temperature gap between @xmath4 and @xmath1 also becomes smaller , i.e. , the afm transition occurs at the temperature closer to the structural phase transition temperature .",
    "actually the structural phase transition and afm ordering happen simultaneously in the more three - dimensional 122 parent compounds like bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 .    , and magnetic transition temperature @xmath1 associated to the afm order of fe ions , versus the @xmath2-axis for @xmath0feaso ( @xmath0 = la , sm , gd , tb ) .",
    "inset : plot of @xmath37 versus @xmath38 .",
    "the open circles denote the experimental data of @xmath37 , and the solid squares denote the theoretical values .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "the experimental results can be understood within the theory proposed in ref.@xcite where an effective heisenberg - type magnetic exchange model , the so called @xmath39-@xmath40-@xmath41 model with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 being the in - plane nearest neighbor(nn ) , in - plane next nearest neighbor(nnn ) and out - of - plane magnetic exchange couplings respectively , explains both the structural and magnetic transitions associated with the feas layers . in this model , a collinear afm ground state is obtained when @xmath39 is less than 2@xmath40 , and a nematic ising magnetic order transition that breaks lattice rotational symmetry takes place at a temperature equal to or higher than the collinear afm transition temperature@xcite . by including the lattice and spin coupling , the nematic order naturally produces an orthorhombic lattice distortion .",
    "therefore , the model captures both structural and magnetic transitions and suggests the structural transition be driven magnetically .",
    "a quantitative prediction of this model is that the difference between the structural and afm transition temperature is determined by the ratio between @xmath41 and @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath38 .",

    "quickly as the lattice constant along @xmath2-axis deceases , and therefore the temperature difference between @xmath4 and @xmath1 should decrease according to this model .",
    "the result is plotted in the inset of fig.5 .",
    "the experimental data of @xmath37 are in agreement with the theoretical calculations . by measuring the spin wave gap around the wavevector ( 0 , @xmath45 , 0 ) as shown in ref.@xcite in future neutron scattering experiments",

    "in summary , we have studied the structural phase transition of four parent compounds @xmath0feaso ( @xmath0=la , sm , gd , tb ) by measuring low - temperature x - ray diffractions . as @xmath0 is changed from la to tb , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as well as the @xmath2 axis decrease significantly . furthermore , the temperature difference between @xmath4 and @xmath1 becomes smaller as the @xmath2 axis becomes shorter .",
    "according to the theoretical calculations proposed in ref.@xcite , the out - of - plane magnetic exchange coupling increases quickly with the decreasing @xmath2-axis lattice constant and therefore the temperature difference between @xmath4 and @xmath1 is significantly influenced .",
    "the experimental data of @xmath37 are in agreement with the theoretical calculations .",
    "this result supports the theoretical proposal that the structural phase transition is driven by a nematic ising magnetic order due to the presence of intrinsic magnetic frustration , and indicates that the dimensionality could have important effect on the afm ordering , and the magnetism may play an important role in high-@xmath7 superconductivity of the iron pnictides .",
