    "the galactic center ( gc ) , at an assumed distance of 7.9 kpc , is a complex region containing many compact and diffuse high - energy astrophysical sources ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the dynamics of the central few lightyears is dominated by what is believed to be a supermassive black hole , sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) .",
    "the gc has been identified as a point - like source of tev @xmath1-rays  by a number of air erenkov  telescopes . in our work",
    "we concentrate exclusively on the data from hess @xcite as these provide the best constraints on the source properties .",
    "the gc signal is coincident within @xmath2 of sgr a * , though with a centroid displaced roughly @xmath3 ( @xmath4  pc ) to the east of the gc @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is a pure power law with photon index @xmath5 , and the total flux above 1  tev is @xmath6  m@xmath7  s@xmath8 @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we examined a hadronic scenario for the creation of the @xmath0tev @xmath1-rays : a power - law population of protons is accelerated close to sgr a * , perhaps through the process of stochastic acceleration on the turbulent magnetic fields expected to pervade this inner region .",
    "these then diffuse outwards through the strong magnetic fields of the largely evacuated stellar - wind region surrounding sgr a * before , finally , colliding with gas in the high molecular density clumps that make up the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) . such collisions ( assumed to be exclusively proton on proton for simplicity ) generate neutral mesons that then decay into the @xmath1-rays  which , by construction , we detect here at earth .",
    "in the current work we self - consistently calculate the synchrotron emissivity of the secondary leptons that must also be produced in our scenario .",
    "these come from the decay of the charged mesons created in the same p - p collisions that we posit explain the @xmath1-ray emission ",
    "though , in constrast to the case for @xmath1-ray emission , we find that , because of the extremely strong magnetic fields there ( and despite the relatively low ambient densities ) radio emission from the wind region is more important than that from the cnd . finally , we compare our predictions for radio emission with archival and new radio data on the region we have assembled .",
    "we firstly summarize the results obtained by @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we employed a realistic model of the density of matter through the gc arrived at by @xcite .",
    "these authors computed the density distribution in this region caused by the interactions of stellar winds from the young stars surrounding sgr a*. in addition to the stellar wind gas , the volume also contains a high - density torus of molecular gas with an inner radius of 1.2  pc and a thickness of 1  pc representing the observed cnd .    the average density in the model stellar - wind gas ( taken to be any region where @xmath9  @xmath10 ) is @xmath11  @xmath10 , while it is @xmath12 233,222  @xmath10 within the model molecular torus .",
    "taking @xmath13  kev as the average temperature of the stellar - wind gas @xcite , 100  k for the temperature of the molecular torus ( @xcite and references therein ) , and assuming equipartition , the average field intensity is @xmath14  mg in the stellar - wind region and @xmath15  mg within the torus . in any particular cell",
    "the magnetic field was assumed to be generated with an intensity that satisfies @xmath16 gauss @xmath17 @xmath10 for the cnd region and @xmath18 gauss @xmath19 @xmath10 in the stellar - wind gas .",
    "our procedure for determining a physical description of the field direction at any position in the computational grid is described in @xcite .",
    "computational resources limited our modeling to proton energies between @xmath20 and @xmath21  tev",
    ". a total of 222,617 proton trajectories was calculated with energies uniformly distributed in this range .",
    "these trajectories were split into @xmath22 energy bins ( @xmath23 , \\ldots , [ 13.9 - 14.0]$ ] ) . from these data the steady state distribution of protons ( given in @xmath10 ev @xmath8 ) in each of the 7500 computational cells of the cnd and the 7022 cells of the stellar - wind region could be inferred .",
    "as a proton random - walks its way through the the turbulent magnetic field of the gc it may collide with a low - energy proton in the ambient medium and produce pions via the reaction @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 , denoting hadron , is a proton or , if charge exchange occurs , a neutron and variable and energy - dependent multiplicities of neutral ( @xmath26 ) and charged ( @xmath27 ) pions are , in general , produced but electric charge must be conserved overall .",
    "( in our calculations we also account for the sub - dominant contribution from charged and neutral kaons . )",
    "neutral pions will subsequently decay into two photons and charged pions to electrons , positrons , and neutrinos .",
    "in this letter we adopt the steady - state proton distributions within each modeled clump of cnd and stellar - wind region gas arrived at by @xcite .",
    "we then use the techniques outlined at length in @xcite to calculate  on the basis of ( i ) these steady state @xmath28 distributions , ( ii ) the ambient hydrogen number density , and ( iii ) clump magnetic fields  the steady state ( processed ) distributions of secondary leptons within each clump and the resulting synchrotron emission from each clump .",
    "to test our theoretical model we have obtained @xmath0ghz radio fluxes covering the region of the cnd defined by a @xmath29 rectangle with sides parallel to galactic longitude / latitude and with sgr a * at the center .",
    "where possible , we have chosen interferometry data obtained with an array configuration that results in a beam smaller than this region of interest to ameliorate the problem of confusion with nearby strong radio sources ( sgr a east in particular ) . on the other hand , to ensure that the diffuse flux through this region that we are interested in ",
    "present on scales up to the size of the region  is not integrated out , we also demand that the array configuration possess some antenna spacings that are suitably small .    for the reasons just given we make use in our analysis of medium resolution ( @xmath30 ; @xcite ) 330 mhz vla data , similar resolution sumss 843 mhz data , and serendipitous atca observations of the gc at 1384 mhz and 2368 mhz .",
    "these latter data were obtained with a somewhat lower resolution ( @xmath31 at 1384 mhz , and @xmath32 at 2368 mhz . ) which is nevertheless sensitive to emission on the size scales of the cnd . for each radio image",
    ", we used a number of independent methods to obtain the flux inside the region of interest ( see @xcite for details ) . to obtain a conservative estimate on the error in the flux determinations , the standard deviation between all flux estimates at a particular frequency",
    "was taken to be the rms error on the final flux quoted .",
    "( errors due to gain and to image noise make a negligible contribution ) .",
    "the quoted central value for the flux at a given frequency is obtained from smearing the beam to @xmath33 resolution , and reading the peak flux which provides the most reliable determination .",
    "flux determinations are : @xmath34 jy at 330 mhz , @xmath35 jy at 843 mhz , @xmath36 jy at 1384 mhz , and @xmath37 jy at 2368 mhz .",
    "these data are shown as the lower frequency data points in figure [ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( b ) .",
    "the data points at 843 , 1384 , and 2368 mhz define a non - thermal , power - law spectrum in frequency @xmath38 , indicating a steep , synchrotron - radiating electron population ( whether primary or secondary ) of @xmath39 .",
    "the presence of non - thermal emission near sgr a west was first discussed by @xcite and was subsequently extensively investigated by @xcite .",
    "we note that the spectrum we determined for the region is steeper than that found by these latter authors though the overall normalization at 1384 mhz is compatible .",
    "our datum at 330 mhz falls below the @xmath40 power law ; this , however , is as expected as sgr a complex radio emission is strongly attenuated at around this frequency and below because of free - free absorption by thermal gas associated with the sgr a west structure as established by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , according to these authors ( see also @xcite ) , the spectral index pertaining to sgr a east as a whole is approximately 1 with a corresponding average flux density at 1384 mhz of approximately 0.014 jy / arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "this is roughly half of the flux density we measure from the cnd region .    at frequencies higher than 2368 mhz",
    ", we have obtained snapshot observations with atca at 4800 and 8640 mhz .",
    "we measure 22 and 21 jy at 4800 and 8640 mhz over the same solid angle as for the lower frequency observations and compatible with the results obtained by @xcite at 4.9 ghz .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( b ) , we also show fluxes measured by @xcite at 84 and 230 ghz , @xcite at 43.25 ghz , and @xcite at 91 ghz .",
    "these latter measurements are not perfectly matched in solid angle to the region of concern and should be taken as indicative only .",
    "overall , they show that the spectrum of the cnd region has become dominated by thermal emission from sgr a west at @xmath42 4 ghz and do not provide a strong constraint on our secondary synchrotron emission model .",
    "from the modeling described in @xcite , we have simulated data describing the steady - state proton distribution for the clumps of matter that make up the cnd and the stellar - wind region ( each of varying density , magnetic field strength , and position ) .    synchrotron radiation in the ghz range by secondary leptons in the mean magnetic field of the cnd , 0.35 mg",
    ", requires initiating parent @xmath28 s of energy @xmath43 ev and only @xmath44 ev in the 3 mg mean field of the wind region ( assuming a power - law @xmath28 spectrum of spectral index 2.3 ) .",
    "such energies are unfortunately well below the 1 tev threshold of our proton propagation modeling .",
    "we assume , then , that the steady - state proton distribution of any given computational cell is a pure power law ( in momentum ) with such power law fitted to match our modeled 1 - 100 tev proton spectra . despite our simulating more than @xmath45 proton trajectories , we must deal ( in our power - law fitting ) with empty energy bins in many clumps .",
    "we address this issue by producing ( on the basis of our modeled , _ overall _ clump spectra ) parameterizations of the tev proton flux and fitted spectral index in terms of the clump radial separation from sgr a * and magnetic field strength . with these parameterizations in hand",
    "we can determine , for any clump at given radius and with given magnetic field , the _ expected _ value for the @xmath28 flux in a given 10@xmath46-decade energy bin .",
    "for a zero - entry bin , we replace the zero with this expected value divided by the free parameter @xmath47 .",
    "we then use a mathematica routine to perform a @xmath48 fit in the parameter @xmath47 of the overall cnd tev @xmath1-ray spectrum to the hess data ( the @xmath1-ray emission by cells in the wind region only contributes at the @xmath0 0.1% level and is ignored here ) .",
    "we find a minimum reduced @xmath48 value of 1.2 ( for 32 degrees of freedom ) at @xmath49 .",
    "extension of individual clump spectra below tev using the power - law assumption then allows us to also make a prediction for the synchrotron radio emission due to secondary leptons in each cnd clump and , using the same @xmath47 value , in each cell of the wind region too ( our procedure here takes into account cooling by the ionization , bremsstrahlung and synchrotron processes to arrive at the steady - state electron and positron distributions within each clump ; see @xcite for details ) . the same extension  to still lower proton energies  allows us to also predict the lower - energy @xmath1-ray spectrum from the cnd ( and also the wind region ) .",
    "the total @xmath1-ray and synchrotron radio emission curves for all cells in the cnd are shown as the solid ( blue ) curves in figures [ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "gamma - ray and radio emission by cells in the wind region is shown by the long - dashed ( purple ) curves in the same figures .",
    "as may be seen , the @xmath1-ray normalized secondary synchrotron radio flux from the cnd directly accounts for @xmath0 10 % of the observed ghz radio emission but with a rather flatter spectrum than the observation data suggest . in contrast , the wind region is modeled to produce a radio spectrum consistent with observation but with around twice the observed normalization . given that this determination involves absolutely no fine tuning and is predicated on a fit of theoretical @xmath1-ray emission _ from a separate region _",
    "( i.e. , the cnd clumps ) to the tev hess data , this is a remarkable level of agreement and we conclude that our secondary emission model can self - consistently account for both the @xmath1-ray emission seen from the direction of the gc and the total radio emission from the wind and cnd regions ( i.e. , a @xmath50 region centered in sgr a * ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( a ) one notes that the cnd @xmath1-ray emission for the scenario above is roughly consistent with the level of emission seen from the egret source 3eg  j1746 - 2851 @xcite at the two lowest energy data points around 70 mev .",
    "we do not claim , however , that the cnd emission explains the origin of the observed @xmath1-rays .",
    "in fact , recent studies have shown that the egret source excludes the gc at the @xmath51 confidence level @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the _ predicted _ cnd emission was certainly inside the wide field of view of the egret instrument s gc pointings .",
    "the spectrum of 3eg  j1746 - 2851 serves , then , as an upper limit to the allowed emission from the cnd . the ( blue ) solid curve would seem to be just excluded .",
    "a fit to the hess data with the additional constraint that the extrapolated @xmath1-ray emission obey the constraint that it be unobserved by egret ( which we translate to the requirement that the predicted low energy gamma ray curve pass 2@xmath52 below the most constraining egret datum near 70 mev ) requires @xmath53 and the radio spectrum obtained in this case , shown as the ( red ) short - dashed curve in [ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( b ) , is statistically compatible with the radio data .",
    "the reduced @xmath48 for this case is rather bad , however : 2.2 for 32 degrees of freedom .",
    "the cnd @xmath1-ray spectrum for this case is shown as the ( red ) short - dashed curve in [ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( a ) .    also shown in figures [ fig : cndradiospectrum ] ( a ) and ( b ) are ( yellow ) dot - dash curves that show , respectively , the predicted gamma - ray and radio emission for a single zone model that assumes a single power - law @xmath28 population ( @xmath54 ) tuned to match the hess emission .",
    "with such a model one notes that , as first determined by @xcite , the low energy @xmath1-ray curve passes well below the egret points .",
    "but the model predicts far too little synchrotron when compared with our full calculations that sum emission over each clump of the cnd and wind regions with its own @xmath28 spectrum , magnetic field and ambient hydrogen number density .",
    "this underestimation probably arises from the assumption of a ` mean ' @xmath55 field within the single zone model that implictly neglects the ( i ) relative accumulation of protons into clumps of higher magnetic field strength ( where they are more strongly trapped than elsewhere ) and ( ii ) the greater synchrotron emissivity of secondaries created in such clumps .    finally , we have reviewed data available from observations of the gc and the cnd and wind regions at other wavelengths to see whether these offer any further constraint on our model .    given the steady - state positron production rate in our scenario",
    "we predict a 511 kev @xmath1-ray production rate from electron - positron annihilation of @xmath56 yr@xmath8 , well inside the limit from integral observations ( @xmath57 yr@xmath8 out to an angular radius of 8@xmath58 : @xcite another possible constraint is offered by hard x - ray / soft @xmath1-ray observations . our model predicts diffuse secondary emission at energies of 10@xmath59 ev due to both the bremsstrahlung and , dominantly , synchrotron processes .",
    "we have modeled such emission to compare it against the spectrum , at a comparable energy , of the integral / ibis source igrj17456 - 2901 @xcite ; we find ourselves well below the level of flux from this source .",
    "there are several major conclusions we can draw from this study :    \\(1 ) the pre - existing data were not sufficient for a tight constraint on our predictions .",
    "new data were acquired for this project .",
    "the compilation of data demonstrates that the black hole - induced hadronic model for the tev gamma rays introduced in @xcite is certainly consistent with the broadband emission from this process at other wavelengths .",
    "\\(2 ) in fact , more strongly , we have also shown that , _ without fine - tuning , the hadronic process may actually explain essentially all the diffuse radio emission observed from the inner few pc of the galaxy_.    \\(3 ) the fact that in this model the protons energized by the black hole and ejected into the ism accumulate in the magnetic fields of the cnd , provides a spatial definition for where the secondaries will be active unlike , say , the primary lepton model , in which the electrons may be accelerated wherever shock fragments form in an expanding shell .",
    "\\(4 ) the propagation calculation of @xcite showed that diffusion processing by the gc magnetic field leads to a considerable spectral steepening of the injection spectrum , @xmath60 requiring in turn , that the spectrum of protons injected close to sgr a * must be very flat , @xmath61 , in order to supply the requisite @xmath62 spectrum of @xmath1-rays .",
    "this is much flatter than the @xmath63 spectrum expected from first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "such a hard spectrum might be created via the ( second - order fermi ) stochastic acceleration mechanism .",
    "for instance , as determined by @xcite stochastic acceleration in a magnetically - dominated funnel close to the black hole could accelerate protons into a distribution as flat as @xmath64 , approaching the requisite hardness . the stochastic acceleration mechanism investigated by @xcite",
    "may also be able to produce the required spectrum .",
    "the question of whether a stochastic acceleration can be made to work in this context will be addressed elsewhere by the current authors .",
    "\\(5 ) finally , the hadronic scenario we have explored here may be a test bed of what is actually happening near the base of relativistic jets in more powerful sources , such as agns and quasars .",
    "there we would have a more difficult time discerning the various processes , because the environment is dense and chaotic .",
    "but in sgr a * , the environment is much more sedate , with lower density , and less activity .",
    "sgr a * does not itself produce relativistic jets that we can see .",
    "but that may simply be a consequence of the relative weakness of this process in this particular source .",
    "it may be that something like the proton injection / acceleration scenario ( with subsequent propagation out to relatively large scales before final interaction ) posited in our earlier paper  and whose phenomenological consequences we have explored here  is happening on a much bigger scale in the more powerful agns .",
