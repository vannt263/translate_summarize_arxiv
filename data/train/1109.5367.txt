    "a detailed analysis shows that although the measurements are not susceptible to small variations in the order - parameter symmetry , the data can be overall consistently described by taking into account a single energy gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum with @xmath14 symmetry and a change in the sampling of the spatial field distributions by the muons due to vortex - pinning effects .",

    "+ it should be noted that the presented explanation for the observed field distributions might not be the only possible one  yet , the introduced phenomenological model describes all obtained data consistently even though up to now the weight @xmath127 can not be fully related to the underlying quantities such as the pinning potential .",
    "any other model would also have to be coherent and particularly it would have to provide an explanation for the temperature dependence of @xmath92 .",
    "+ one such other possibility to explain the @xmath0sr data would be the presence of field- or vortex - induced antiferromagnetic order which would not be visible in the macroscopic magnetization measurements .",
    "this phenomenon has been reported to be present in cuprate high - temperature superconductors in applied fields of a few tesla by various techniques.@xcite yet , based on neutron - scattering results which indicate no ordered magnetic phase in low fields in la@xmath90sr@xmath91cuo@xmath3  with such high doping level as used in the present study , sonier  _ et  al . _",
    "concluded from their @xmath0sr studies that only disordered field - induced magnetism is likely to occur in low applied fields.@xcite therefore , the presence of an ordered magnetic state can be excluded for the presently discussed data .",
    "the tf @xmath0sr data presented in this work show a striking resemblance with data obtained earlier by khasanov  _ et  al . _ in @xmath0sr experiments on single crystals of cuprate high - temperature superconductors .",
    "their data have been interpreted as evidence for two distinct energy gaps in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum , e.g. of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3,@xcite yba@xmath119cu@xmath120o@xmath121,@xcite and yba@xmath9cu@xmath3o@xmath135.@xcite note that this is basically different from reports of slight deviations from a @xmath14 gap symmetry as measured , e.g. by phase - sensitive methods in yba@xmath119cu@xmath120o@xmath121.@xcite the conclusions of ref",
    ".   are mainly based on the observation of an inflection point in the temperature dependence of the second central moment of the magnetic field distribution @xmath6 obtained by tf @xmath0sr measurements in the vortex state ( like seen in fig .",
    "[ fch]a ) , while the corresponding temperature dependence of the measured mean field has not been discussed at all .",
    "our tf @xmath0sr data on la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  are very similar , yet , the above presented analysis within the framework of conventional vortex - lattice - generated field distributions extended by vortex - pinning effects appears to describe the overall @xmath0sr and magnetization data in a coherent way .",
    "this is also in line with the suppression of the low - temperature increase of the second central moment of @xmath6 in higher applied fields@xcite where inter - vortex interactions compete with vortex pinning and minimize its effects on the measured field distributions .",
    "+ and , while it seems to be a reasonable approach to model two distinct gaps if an inflection point in @xmath136 is found ( e.g. @xmath137@xcite or @xmath138@xcite ) , the observation of the strong increase in the probed mean field @xmath103 in the tf @xmath0sr measurements which is not observed in the magnetization measurements , renders it unlikely that the observed full second central moment of @xmath6 is a true measure of @xmath139 at low temperatures .",
    "moreover , it is pointed out , that the reported agreement between the obtained magnitudes of two - gap contributions from tf @xmath0sr and neutron crystal - field spectroscopy@xcite is probably fortuitous since fundamentally different models were employed to obtain those values .",
    "while in the analysis of the tf @xmath0sr data the contributions to the superfluid density were treated to be additive ( _ after _ the integrations over the fermi surface),@xcite in the analysis of the neutron data the individual gaps are added together ( _ before _ the integration over the fermi surface ) yielding effectively _",
    "one pseudogap _ with an anisotropy @xmath140 and shifted nodes.@xcite taking into account such an anisotropic _ superconducting gap _ in the modeling of the superfluid density would result only in tiny overall changes from the @xmath14 scenario since firstly , only the modulus of the gap is relevant and secondly , the integration over the full fermi surface@xcite averages out small effects .",
    "therefore , in general , a small gap anisotropy in the sense of refs .   or   can not be excluded , however , its determination from magnetic - penetration - depth data is rather difficult and indirect .",
    "+ in conclusion , using low - field tf @xmath0sr in the mixed state of a la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  single crystal a strong increase in the probed mean field and the second central moment of the measured field distribution is found at low temperatures . by combining @xmath0sr and magnetization measurements it is shown that these effects seem to be primarily related to vortex - pinning effects changing the sampling of the spatial field distribution by the muons and that the data can be consistently described by taking into account a single energy gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum with @xmath14 symmetry . however",
    ", small variations of the superconducting order parameter can not be excluded on the basis of the presented @xmath0sr data . given this assessment",
    ", the extrapolated magnetic penetration depth @xmath141  nm agrees well with reports of earlier experiments .",
    "+ furthermore , this article commemorates that tf @xmath0sr  in the way it has been employed for the present study  is first and foremost a very sensitive technique for the determination of local static or dynamic magnetic field distributions but the muon is neither a _ direct _ probe of the superfluid density of a superconductor in the mixed state nor of its order - parameter symmetry as also has been realized earlier.@xcite nevertheless , these parameters of a type - ii superconductor can be deduced from tf @xmath0sr data in the vortex state if a coherent description of the determined field distributions is available .",
