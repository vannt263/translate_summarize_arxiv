    "there is a general consensus that quasars belong to two different radio populations , radio - quiet quasars ( rqqsos ) and radio - loud quasars .",
    "@xmath2 is usually defined as the ratio of the radio ( 6  ) to the optical ( 440  ) flux densities and the radio - quiet quasars have a value of @xmath3 , while the radio - loud quasars have @xmath4 ( kellermann et al .",
    "it is found that @xmath5 of quasars are in the radio - loud category .",
    "an additional distinction between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with strong and weak radio sources comes from the observation that radio loud objects essentially all occur in elliptical galaxies and rqqsos appear to reside in galaxies that are dominated by exponential disks . however the rqqsos that occur in elliptical host galaxies are in general more luminous than those that reside in disks ( taylor et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "little is known about the short - term variability of radio - quiet quasars , because few studies have been carried out ( gopal - krishna et al .",

    "in contrast blazars display rapid variability in the wavelength range from radio to gamma rays .",
    "the blazar class encompasses both optically - violently - variable ( ovv ) quasars and bl lac objects and about one quarter of all radio - loud quasars are also in the blazar category ( webb et al .",
    "1988 ; pica et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "there are many theoretical models which endeavour to explain the large and rapid variability exhibited by blazars and these are usually divided into extrinsic and intrinsic categories .",
    "one extrinsic mechanism is microlensing of emission knots in a relativistic jet when they pass behind planets in an intervening galaxy ( mcbreen & metcalfe 1987 ; gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) .",
    "the rapid variability from superluminal - microlensing may be responsible for the variability observed in ( rabbette et el .",
    "1996 ) and ( romero et al .",
    "one family of intrinsic models is based on a rotating supermassive black hole which accretes matter from a surrounding accretion disc and ejects two oppositely directed jets .",
    "the shocked - jet model involves shocks which move with relativistic speeds along the jet ( qian et al .",
    "1991 ; marscher , 1980 ) .",
    "it is believed the shock propagates along the line of sight , through inhomogeneous , small - scale structures distributed along the jet .",
    "these inhomogeneous structures are illuminated , or excited , by the moving relativistic shock , through the amplification of the magnetic field and the acceleration of electrons which causes the variability in polarization and in flux density that are observed over a wide range of frequencies ( hughes et al .",
    "another family of intrinsic models invokes numerous flares or hotspots in the accretion disk and the corona that is believed to surround the central engine ( wiita et al .",
    "1992 ; mangalam & wiita 1993 ) and indeed a similar model has been proposed to explain x - ray variations in blazars ( abramowicz et al .",
    "the fact that rqqsos generally lie on the far - infrared versus radio correlation ( sopp & alexander 1991 ) suggest that star formation plays an important role in their radio emission . it has been suggested by terlevich et al . (",
    "1992 ) that the low values of @xmath2 in rqqsos can be explained without jets or accretion discs , by postulating a circumnuclear starburst within a dense , high - metallicity nuclear environment . in this model the optical / uv and",
    "bolometric luminosity arises from young stars ; the variability comes from cooling instabilities in the shell of compact supernova remnants and supernova flashes .",
    "variability on intranight timescales is however difficult to explain with this model because of the short timescales involved .",
    "furthermore radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars have very different radio power outputs but have similar spectral shapes in the radio region and suggest that a significant fraction of the rqqsos may be capable of producing powerful radio emission ( barvainis et al .",
    "kellermann et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found possible radio extensions up to about 300   in a few rqqsos and assert that for at least these few cases , the emission is too large to be starburst related ( stein 1996 ) .",

    "the origin of the peaked radio emission is not understood but absorption of the radio emission may occur in the dusty dense interstellar medium and also the contributions of different spectra from several source components may be involved .",

    "1996 ) but showed no evidence for the large intrinsic absorption of soft x - rays by cold neutral matter .",
    "the soft x - ray variability excluded electron scattering for most of the soft x - rays and suggest absorption by a warm ionized gas with internal dust .",

    "the 0.6 to 8   spectrum was fitted with a power law with @xmath86 which is steeper than the average value of @xmath87 found for rqqsos in the asca band .",
    "brinkmann et al ( 1996 ) point out that the line of sight to the quasar may graze the edge of the torus and suggest that small changes in viewing conditions could produce marked changes in intensity and spectral shape .",
    "however it is difficult to understand how changes in viewing conditions could produce such rapid variability with no significant spectral changes .",
    "it is plausible that is an example of a radio loud quasar that is viewed through a dusty ionizing outflow , possibly associated with a merger , that severely attenuates the radio emission so that the source is classified as a rqqso . in this context",
    "it should be noted that the quasar could be classified as a rqqso at 5   but the radio spectrum rises steeply toward higher frequencies and this source is radio - loud when the 90   flux density is adopted ( schnopper et al .",

    "( 1994 ) , ( ii ) the source varied by a factor of 4.5 over a period of ten years and could have been more variable given the very limited monitoring at radio frequencies and ( iii ) the radio spectrum is consistent with a flat or inverted spectrum ( barvainis et al . 1996 ) .",
    "no vlbi observations have been reported for but one of the other variable rqqsos was detected with essentially all of its flux in the vlbi core and the high brightness temperature limit confirmed the self - absorbed synchrotron hypothesis for the flat spectrum component ( barvainis et al .",
    "this component may well be a scaled - down version of the radio sources observed in radio loud quasars and future vlbi observations of may also reveal a similar component .",
    "a long - term survey of a sample of high luminosity ( @xmath0 ) and medium to high redshift ( @xmath91 ) radio - quiet quasars was undertaken , in order to search for short and long term optical variability on timescales of hours to years .",
    "a large sample of 23 rqqsos was observed , with a total observation time of about 60 hours spread over a period of several years .",
    "long - term variability was detected in the rqqso when it varied by 0.18 magnitudes in the v - band between 1992 and 1996 .",
    "no rapid variability was observed in any of the sources in this sample of rqqsos .",
    "the finding charts are included because they identify the rqqso and the reference stars used in the photometry and hence are available to other observers .",
    "there have been a few reports of rapid optical variability in a number of rqqsos but these reports are not in conflict with the results presented here because such small variability would not have been detected in many of the sources monitored in this survey .",
    "the unusual properties of two sources are highlighted .",
    "these sources were not monitored in this survey but have recently been added to the list of sources for study .",
    "the remarkable source combines some of the properties of blazars and radio quiet quasars and hence further observations may elucidate the nature of this hybrid source .",
    "the two unusual sources have @xmath2 values near the top of the range for rqqsos and also have unusual radio spectra that may signify the presence of several source components .",
    "further observations with vla and vlbi should reveal new and enlightening views on the radio properties of these sources .",
