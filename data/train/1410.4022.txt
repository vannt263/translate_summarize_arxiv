    "direct cooling of molecules into the ultracold regime is challenging , though recent progress on laser cooling shows tremendous promise  @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy is to exploit the efficient techniques for cooling atomic gases before associating ultracold atoms to create ultracold molecules . in this context ,",
    "magnetoassociation of weakly bound molecules using feshbach resonances has proved pivotal  @xcite .",
    "feshbach resonances arise when the energy of two colliding atoms matches that of a quasi - bound molecular state .",
    "coupling between the atomic and molecular states leads to an avoided crossing in the energy spectrum as a function of an applied magnetic field , and a resonance feature in the @xmath0-wave scattering length . sweeping the magnetic field across the feshbach resonance",
    "so as to adiabatically follow the avoided crossing can be used to populate the weakly bound molecular state responsible for the resonance . in reality ,",
    "ultracold atomic gases are subject to considerable momentum spread which leads to a continuum of atomic scattering states and can limit the efficiency of the molecule production  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , magnetoassociation was first used successfully to create ultracold cs@xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2k@xmath1 molecules  @xcite in 2003 , and has subsequently been investigated in a range of different atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "the technique has been used to produce the first molecular condensate  @xcite and has proved an important first step in the production of molecules in the rovibrational ground state via stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate magnetoassociation in an ultracold atomic gas of cs .",
    "in particular we demonstrate and characterise a technique which allows the repeated output coupling of ultracold molecules from a single trapped atomic cloud .",
    "additionally we exploit the near threshold bound state structure of cs@xmath1 to demonstrate control of the dynamics of the molecular cloud , opening up a route to the accumulation of multiple molecular pulses in a second trap and the realisation of a low - energy molecular collider .",
    "the experiments described in this paper use bose  einstein condensates of cs in the @xmath3 state confined in an optical trap .",
    "the use of this internal state eliminates the large two - body inelastic losses associated with the magnetically trappable states  @xcite and has proved essential for efficient cooling of cs into the quantum degenerate regime  @xcite .",
    "fortunately the magnetic field dependence of the scattering length in this state is highly favourable , both for tuning the elastic collision cross section and for magnetoassociation , as depicted in figure  [ fig : csscatbound30 g ] . here",

    "an abbreviation of the assignment to @xmath10 is used .    in the low field range , shown in figure  [ fig : csscatbound30 g ]  ( a )",
    ", the scattering length varies markedly with magnetic field , changing from large and negative to large and positive , crossing zero at 17  g. the first cs bec  @xcite was realised close to this zero crossing where tuning of the scattering length to a moderate positive value was essential for efficient evaporation of the atomic sample .",
    "subsequently , cs@xmath1 molecules  @xcite were produced using a feshbach resonance at 19.89  g , allowing the study of the bound state spectrum  @xcite shown in figure 1(b ) . in these experiments ,",
    "the cs dimers were transferred into a different molecular state using an avoided crossing at 13.3  g. transfer into this new state led to the observation of feshbach - like resonance features @xcite between colliding cs@xmath1 molecules . in addition , cs@xmath11 feshbach molecules have been transferred into a metastable state above the dissociation threshold @xcite , and collisions between dimers @xcite , and between dimers and atoms @xcite have been investigated .",

    "we create cs condensates using a sympathetic cooling scheme similar to that developed in our production of dual species rb  cs becs @xcite , where @xmath12rb atoms are used as the refrigerant species .",
    "below we present an outline of our method , focussing on the changes to the routine implemented when producing single species cs condensates .",
    "we begin by loading a magnetic quadrupole trap with a rb ",
    "cs mixture from a dual species magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "prior to loading , the rb and cs are optically pumped into the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states , respectively . forced rf evaporation",
    "is then employed , with the choice of spin states effectively making the quadrupole trap deeper for cs by a factor of three allowing the preferential removal of rb atoms during the evaporation .",
    "the large interspecies scattering length  @xcite means the cs atoms then rapidly equilibrate to the same temperature as the rb atoms .",
    "this results in highly efficient evaporation of cs as shown in figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( a ) .",
    "the evaporation sequence in the magnetic trap is initially optimised for @xmath12rb alone . the same sequence is used for the rb ",
    "cs mixture as only @xmath15 cs atoms ( compared to @xmath16 rb atoms ) are loaded into the trap thus the additional heat load has little impact on the evaporation trajectory .",
    "note , when creating dual species condensates only @xmath17 cs atoms are loaded initially  @xcite .",
    "we characterise the trajectory by the evaporation efficiency , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the phase space densities of the gas before and after the evaporation stage and @xmath20 are the initial and final atom numbers .",
    "this is shown for all stages of the evaporation in figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( a ) . in the magnetic trap",
    ", the sympathetic cooling of the cs has an efficiency of 14(2 ) as relatively few atoms are lost whilst the temperature decreases .",
    "the evaporation in the magnetic trap results in a sample of @xmath21 rb atoms at a psd of @xmath22 and @xmath23 cs atoms at a psd of @xmath24 . at this point majorana spin flips limit the efficiency of any further cooling in this trap and so we transfer the atoms into a crossed optical dipole trap .",

    "the crossed dipole trap  @xcite is formed from two independent beams derived from a single - frequency , @xmath26 nm ipg photonics elr-30lp - sf fibre laser , each focussed to a waist of 68(1)@xmath27 m .",
    "the beams intersect at an angle of 22@xmath28 and are aligned @xmath29 m below the magnetic trap centre . with 6  w in each beam",
    "this results in a trap depth of @xmath30  100@xmath27k .",
    "although the optical trapping beams are switched on throughout the rf evaporation the final transfer into the dipole trap only occurs when the vertical magnetic field gradient is decreased from 187g / cm to 28g / cm . the atoms are no longer completely levitated at this gradient and the optical trap is loaded through elastic collisions @xcite . during the transfer , the majority of the @xmath12rb atoms is removed using the rf knife .",
    "any residual @xmath12rb atoms are removed from the trap using a pulse of resonant light .",
    "typically @xmath31 cs atoms are loaded into the dipole trap at a temperature of 20.1(1)@xmath27k and a psd of @xmath32 .",
    "to suppress two - body losses @xcite , the atoms are transferred into their absolute ground state via rf rapid adiabatic passage @xcite whilst at the same time a magnetic bias field is added in such a way to produce a magnetic potential where the magnitude of the field increases in the upwards direction , thereby levitating the final high - field - seeking states of the atoms against gravity .",
    "this state transfer is essential for efficient cooling of cs @xcite .",
    "following the spin flip , we are left with an atomic sample of @xmath33 atoms in the ( 3,+3 ) state at a temperature of 15.04(4)@xmath27k and a psd of @xmath34 .    despite the atoms being in the absolute ground state , three - body recombination can still hinder the progress of evaporation .",
    "feshbach resonances are commonly employed to improve evaporation conditions @xcite , effectively controlling the ratio of good ( elastic ) to bad ( inelastic and reactive ) collisions .",
    "the broad resonance in the ( 3,+3 ) state at 17 g , shown in figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( b ) , is ideal for such an application , giving precise tuning of the scattering length .",
    "a minimum in the three - body loss rate exists at @xmath35 g , offset from the minimum in the elastic scattering rate .",
    "this is the result of an efimov effect @xcite and allows three - body losses to be minimised whilst still ensuring efficient rethermalisation of the atoms .    to probe the scattering properties of the atomic gas , and",
    "hence determine the optimum field for evaporative cooling , a fixed evaporation sequence was carried out at a range of magnetic fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( b ) shows the phase space density of the resultant cloud over the region of 5 to 30 g .",
    "we are able to locate a number of resonances over this field range , each characterised by a drop in atom number and an increase in temperature which results in a sharp decrease in phase space density , shown by dashed lines on figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( b ) .",
    "in addition a broad drop in the psd at 16.9(1)g results from the drop in the elastic collision rate near the zero crossing in the scattering length .",
    "this is indicated by a dotted line on figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( b ) .",
    "we find it is possible to condense cs in two bias field regions ( marked in grey on figure  [ fig : evapefficiency ]  ( b ) ) , the first from 18.1 to 19.6 g and the second from 20.2 to 25 g .",
    "this corresponds to scattering length ranges from 60 to 160@xmath36 and 170 to 400@xmath36 respectively .",
    "these two regions are separated by a feshbach resonance at 19.89 g , later used for magnetoassociation . in the optimum case ,",
    "evaporation to bec is carried out at 22.91(2)g where the scattering length is @xmath37 . here ,",
    "three linear ramps of the dipole trap power are executed , reducing the trap depth to 144  nk . at this point evaporation by merely lowering the optical trap depth stagnates and we instead proceed by tilting the trap  @xcite via an increase in field gradient to 33.6g / cm .",
    "this method produces a condensate of @xmath38 cs atoms . in the lower field region",
    "the evaporation sequence is slightly modified . following initial ramps to decrease the beam powers , the magnetic gradient",
    "is rapidly changed to 42.3g / cm .",
    "this equalises the trap depths in both the vertical direction and along the beams . from here",
    "the gradient is ramped slowly , over 17.5s , to 62g / cm , thus tilting the trapping potential .",
    "this reduces the trap depth with little impact on the trap frequencies @xcite , maintaining the elastic collision rate for lower scattering lengths and resulting in a bec with up to @xmath39 atoms .",
    "following the successful creation of a high phase space density sample , magnetoassociation using the @xmath40 resonance at 19.89 g is carried out to produce cs@xmath1 molecules . the experimental sequence after evaporation",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : csassociationsequence ] .",
    "firstly , the magnetic field is decreased from 22.91 g to a field just above the feshbach resonance .",
    "the molecules are then associated by ramping over a 200 mg window , centred on the resonance , in a period of 10ms .",
    "the resonance width determined from loss measurements is 0.10(2)g .",
    "the subsequent ramp to 17 g binds the molecules by 2mhz@xmath41 .",
    "the bound molecules have a magnetic moment of @xmath42@xmath43 , which corresponds to a levitation gradient of 52g / cm , compared to 31g / cm for the single cs atoms .",
    "this difference means stern - gerlach separation can be used to isolate the two components for imaging . as we can not image the molecules directly",
    ", they must first be dissociated .",
    "this is done by sweeping the magnetic field across the feshbach resonance in the opposite direction to the association ramp .",
    "the dissociated atoms are then imaged using standard resonant absorption imaging following the turn off of the magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig : sterngerlach ] illustrates how the separation can be used to experimentally determine the temperature and magnetic moment of the atomic and molecular clouds .",
    "however , in this case the molecules fall through a sufficient range of magnetic field that several avoided crossings in the bound state spectrum ( figure  [ fig : csscatbound30 g ] ( b ) ) are traversed , altering the magnetic moment of the molecules during their motion . consequently , the magnitude of the upwards force is not constant with position and the cloud trajectory can not be used to reliably measure the magnetic moment of a given molecular state .",
    "this quantity is instead measured by finding the magnetic field gradient which exactly levitates the molecular cloud .",
    "the absolute molecule number produced and association efficiency depend on the psd of the atomic sample before association @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : sterngerlach](c ) . here , the association efficiency is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of molecules produced and @xmath46 is the initial number of cs atoms .",
    "we are able to produce a maximum of @xmath47 molecules , coupled out of a sample of @xmath48 cs atoms with an initial psd of 0.20(1 ) .",
    "we observe our highest association efficiency , 26(2)% , when the molecules are coupled out of a bec .",
    "in the bound - state spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig : csscatbound30 g ] , one can see that avoided crossings between different molecular states exist .",
    "these can be used to change the internal state of the molecules by changing the magnetic bias field @xcite , thereby controlling their magnetic moment .",
    "below we focus on the first avoided crossing of the @xmath40-state which occurs with the @xmath49-state at @xmath50 g , shown in figure  [ fig : magnmom ]  ( a ) . for this avoided crossing the coupling strength between the two states is @xmath51khz @xcite .    using the bound - state spectrum it is possible to calculate the magnetic moment of the molecules . in this bound - state picture",
    "the molecular binding energy is given with respect to the energy of two unbound atoms which changes with magnetic field according to the breit - rabi formula  @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the absolute bound - state energy gives the magnetic moment of the molecules .",
    "the magnetic moment does not change instantaneously between states , but follows the curvature of the avoided crossing between them .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnmom ]  ( a ) shows how the magnetic moment of a molecular sample adiabatically follows the avoided crossing between the @xmath40 and @xmath49-states at 13.3 g .    to implement a change of state it is necessary to precisely control landau - zener tunelling at an avoided crossing .",
    "the rate of the magnetic field ramps used determines whether or not the crossing is adiabatically followed . in the landau - zener model",
    "avoided crossings are characterised by two parameters : the coupling strength @xmath52 , which corresponds to half the energy splitting between the two states at the crossing point , and @xmath53 , the difference in magnetic moment @xmath54 of the two states .",
    "the critical ramp speed , @xmath55 , is defined as @xcite    @xmath56    for fast magnetic field ramps where the rate of change in magnetic field , @xmath57 the crossing is diabatic and the population remains in the same state .",
    "however , for slow ramps , @xmath58 , the population is transferred adiabatically to the other state .",
    "the critical ramp speed for the states of interest is @xmath59g / ms .",
    "the @xmath49-state has a magnetic moment of @xmath60@xmath43 and hence a levitation .",
    "the difference in magnetic moment of the two states involved in this avoided crossing makes it possible to apply a magnetic field gradient that over - levitates one state and under - levitates the other .",
    "combined with the fact that the molecules experience a different bias field as a function of vertical position due to the magnetic field gradient ( see figure  [ fig : sterngerlach ] ( a ) ) , this gives us the ability to manipulate the internal state of the molecular cloud as it falls .",
    "figure  [ fig : magnmom](a ) shows the variation of the magnetic moment with magnetic field as the avoided crossing between the two states is traversed adiabatically .",
    "we expect that molecules released from the optical trap will initially fall before beginning to oscillate in the vertical direction as the molecules are transferred between the two states  @xcite .    to demonstrate this experimentally we begin by producing a sample of feshbach molecules .",
    "following the feshbach association at 19.89 g the bias field is rapidly changed to 14.9 g at the position of the optical dipole trap . at the same time",
    "the magnetic field gradient is ramped to 40g / cm .",
    "once the optical trap is switched off the molecules begin to fall through the field gradient , in the direction of decreasing field .",
    "when the magnitude of the net field drops just below 13.3 g the molecules are transferred into the @xmath49-state and are pushed upward as a result of the over - levitation of this state , appearing to ` bounce ' . as the molecules travel upwards and move to a region of higher field , they are transferred back into the @xmath40-state . as the gradient field is insufficient to support the molecules in this state they begin to fall under gravity once more .",
    "figure  [ fig : posfit ]  ( a ) shows absorption images of the ` bouncing ' molecules , clearly demonstrating the vertical oscillation of the cloud . note that the magnetic field ramp to 14.9  g is important to ensure that the molecular cloud begins its trajectory sufficiently close to the avoided crossing .",
    "if the cloud is falling too quickly as it enters the @xmath49-state , the upwards force provided is not sufficient to change the direction of motion before the neighboring crossing to the @xmath61-state is encountered .",

    "the magnetic quadrupole field alone generates a linear potential in all directions , @xmath62 , where , in accordance with maxwell s equations , the gradient @xmath63 .",
    "the addition of the bias field , @xmath64 , along the @xmath65-axis results in a linear potential chosen to exactly cancel the effect of gravity ( for certain states ) whilst a weak harmonic potential is created along the @xmath66- and @xmath67-directions . in our model",
    "we take into account the exact coil configurations used in the experimental apparatus , calculating the magnetic field on a 3d matrix of points in space .",
    "we find the trajectory of each molecule in the cloud by numerically solving the classical system of equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the mass of the molecules , @xmath70 the gravitational acceleration and @xmath65 and @xmath71 are the vertical and radial displacements respectively .",
    "the magnetic field we apply is cylindrically symmetric about the @xmath65 axis , the azimuthal angle @xmath72 is therefore obtained trivially by conservation of angular momentum .",
    "as the maximum rate of change of the magnetic field during the motion is 0.134g / ms , well below the critical ramp speed of @xmath73g / ms ( see equation  [ eq : adiabsweep ] ) , we assume the molecules are all transferred adiabatically between the @xmath40 and @xmath49-states , so that the magnetic moment follows that in figure  [ fig : magnmom ]  ( a ) . as a consequence , the total potential of the molecules @xmath74 shows a pronounced minimum in the vertical direction ( figure  [ fig : magnmom ]  ( b ) ) despite the fact that there is only a linear gradient in the magnetic field .",
    "it is motion in this potential that leads to the ` bouncing ' shown in figure  [ fig : posfit ]  ( a ) .",
    "we define the initial spatial distribution of the molecules to mirror the distribution of the atoms in the cloud from which they are associated .",
    "the cloud is therefore specified by a 3-dimensional gaussian distribution with a narrower width in the vertical plane , such that the cloud is ellipsoidal in shape , reflecting the aspect ratio of the optical trap .",
    "the initial velocity distribution of the molecules is thermal , and hence given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "we use the experimentally measured cloud temperature of 60(3 )  nk in the simulation , calculated from figure  [ fig : sterngerlach](b ) .",
    "in addition , the molecules are not all associated simultaneously , but over a range of times specified by the width of the atomic cloud and the width of the feshbach resonance which dictates the speed of the association ramp .",
    "as a result , molecules at the top of the cloud begin to fall before those at the bottom , which we account for as an extra contribution to the initial spatial and velocity distributions .",

    "mm.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    it has been shown  @xcite that atoms can be controllably and repeatable output coupled from an atomic source allowing the realisation of a pulsed ` atom laser ' . in the experimental setup presented here , the presence of the magnetic field gradient during the stern - gerlach separation enables the selective addressing of atoms and molecules based on their position .",
    "this makes it possible to perform repeated output coupling of _ molecules _ from a single atomic cloud , echoing the work on atom lasers .",
    "we first carry out the standard magnetoassociation sequence similar to that illustrated in figure  [ fig : csassociationsequence ] , but with the optical dipole trap left on .",
    "the magnetic field gradient levitates the atoms but is insufficient to support the molecules .",
    "the molecules therefore escape the shallow dipole trap , despite the fact that the laser beams are left on throughout .",
    "the output coupled molecules then fall under gravity towards the region of lower field , as shown in figure[fig : sterngerlach](a ) . once the molecules have dropped sufficiently far , it is possible to increase the bias field back to a value above the feshbach resonance at the position of the atoms in the trap without dissociating the molecules .",
    "another molecular sample can then be produced from the atomic cloud by sweeping across the resonance again .",

    "after this , the field at the position of the atoms is jumped back across the resonance to 19.96 g in 0.2ms . after a hold time of 0.1ms , the field is again ramped down to 19.85 g in 2.7ms to produce another sample of molecules . in this way",

    "note that the efficiency with respect to psd decreases faster than that observed in the single pulse production ( see figure  [ fig : sterngerlach ]  ( c ) ) indicating that the atomic gas does not fully rethermalise between output pulses .",
    "this raises the possibility to use the repeated output coupling of molecules to probe the time evolution of the psd and hence rethermalisaion of the atomic cloud . by varying the time between two molecular pulses and observing the association efficiency of the second pulse",
