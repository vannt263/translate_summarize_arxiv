    "the observation of the new baryon state @xmath7 with positive strangeness and minimal quark content @xmath8 @xcite has motivated intense theoretical investigations to clarify the quantum numbers and to understand the under - structures of the exotic state @xcite .",
    "although the pentaquark state @xmath7 can be signed to the top of the antidecuplet @xmath9 with isospin @xmath10 , the spin and parity have not been experimentally determined yet and no consensus has ever been reached on the theoretical side @xcite . the discovery has opened a new field of strong interaction and provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of the low energy qcd especially when multiquark states are involved .",
    "the magnetic moments of the pentaquark states are fundamental parameters as their masses , which have copious information about the underlying quark structures , can be used to distinguish the preferred configurations from various theoretical models and deepen our understanding of the underlying dynamics .",

    "different quark configurations can be implemented with different interpolating currents , if the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks in the pentaquark state @xmath7 are bound into spin zero , color and flavor antitriplet @xmath16 diquarks , we can take the diquarks ( for example , @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 ) instead of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks as the basic constituents to construct the interpolating currents .",

    "<S> in this article , we study the magnetic moment of the pentaquark state @xmath0 as diquark - diquark - antiquark ( @xmath1[ud]\\bar{s}$ ] ) state with the qcd sum rules in the external weak electromagnetic field ( efsr ) and the light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results indicate the magnetic moment is about @xmath2 for the efsr and @xmath3 for the lcsr . as the values obtained from the efsr are more stable than the corresponding ones from the lcsr , @xmath2 is more reliable .     </S>",
