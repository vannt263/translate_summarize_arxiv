    "it is interesting to note that , although the blandford - payne process@xcite has been long known and acknowledged as the standard model for the generation of agn jet outflow , subsequent research works to support its observational evidence has been quite rare . in the present work , therefore , we would like to suggest an event which demonstrates observational supports for the blandford - payne process .",
    "indeed , it is quite hard to speculate any simple and direct observational support for the actual operation of the blandford - payne process .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we would like to propose the coupling of the blandford - payne process to another event in such a manner that this supplementary event could demonstrate the actual operation of the blandford - payne process .",
    "here , we employ the well - known bardeen - petterson effect@xcite to play such a role . to be more concrete , in what follows",
    ", we demonstrate that by coupling these two events , the bardeen - petterson effect would shift or rotate the preferred direction in which the active galactic nuclei(agn ) jet outflow propagates . to this end",
    ", we should make sure that the events have to be well resolved in a time sequence . by requiring that the events have to be well resolved in a time sequence , we demonstrate the condition on the strength of the intra - galactic magnetic field .",
    "it is interesting to note that such direct measurement of the strength of the galactic magnetic field incidentally allows us to check the validity of the blandford - znajek mechanism@xcite for the central engine of agn as it predicts that the agn luminosity is given by @xmath0 which is to be compared with the observational data @xmath1erg s@xmath2 .",
    "given the large - scale poloidal magnetic field , the blandford - payne process for the generation of agn jet outflow could be described as follows .    * on the disk , the outflow begins and reaches the poloidal component of magnetic field by gas pressure in a corona . * the flow is centrifugally driven out along the poloidal magnetic field line that makes an angle of less than @xmath3 with respect to the disc surface . * far away from the disk , the toroidal component of magnetic field comes into play and collimates the outflow into a pair of anti - parallel jets moving perpendicular to the disk .    in this way ,",
    "magnetic stress can extract the energy and angular momentum from an accretion disk independently of the presence of viscosity .      as a simple estimate for @xmath4 , the time scale of the whole outflow process , would be given by ; @xmath5 where the @xmath6 denotes the sound speed(alfvin velocity ) , and the @xmath7 denotes the length scale over which the poloidal magnetic field extends , which are given as @xmath8 respectively , for radio jet(or accretion disk ) length scale of agn , where @xmath9 is the gas pressure of plasma ; @xmath10 is the magnetic flux ; @xmath11 is the plasma density ; @xmath12 is the vacuum permeability ; @xmath13 is the newton s gravitational constant ; @xmath14 is the mass of the black hole , and @xmath15 is the speed of light .",
    "general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics treatment for the deformation of the accretion disk states that the bardeen - petterson precession of the accretion disk developes within the bardeen - petterson radius @xmath16 which is given , rough , by ; @xmath17 which reaches far outside the horizon .",
    "since the total torque involved in the bardeen - petterson effect consists of three parts : alignment , precession , and spin - down components . evidently , the precession time scale and the alignment time scale would be of the same order ; @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 is the total angular momentum of the black hole which is given by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , we would like to propose the coupling of the blandford - payne process to the bardeen - petterson effect . by coupling these two events ,",
    "the bardeen - petterson effect would shift or rotate the preferred direction in which the agn jet outflow propagates .",
    "we begin with a careful prerequisite condition for this to take place . that is",
    ", we should make sure that the events have to be well resolved in a time sequence . along this line",
    ", we demand the following condition .    if @xmath23 , the concurrence of blandford - payne process and bardeen - petterson effect could be resolved(fig .",
    "1 ) . given @xmath24 mg and @xmath25 ,",
    "the time scales are @xmath26 hours , @xmath27 days , which are reasonable time scale to observe two subsequent events : two blandford - payne processes before and after the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "we therefore suggest the observation of radio spectrum with very high degree of resolution employing , say , the vlbi tool(fig .",
    "2 ) . if such spectrum is actually observed , it would support our theoretical expectation : namely , the possible concurrence of the blandford - payne process with the bardeen petterson effect .",
    "if such resolution of the two subsequent radio emission could be observed in the vlbi observation of an agn galaxy sample , it implies that the strength of the galactic magnetic field of the corresponding agn galaxy would be estimated to be @xmath28 .",
    "it is interesting to note that such direct measurement of the strength of the galactic magnetic field incidentally allows us to check the validity of the blandford - znajek mechanism(blandford & znajek 1977 , macdonald & thorne 1982 , martin 1984 ) for the central engine of agn as it predicts that the agn luminosity is given by @xmath0 , which is to be compared with the observational data @xmath29erg s@xmath2 .    9 bardeen , j. m. petterson , j. a. 1975 , apjl .",
