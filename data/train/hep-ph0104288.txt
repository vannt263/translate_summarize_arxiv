    "the gauge hierarchy problem is one of the most challenging problem in particle physics .",
    "it questions why the electroweak scale @xmath4 gev is so small as compared to the scale of gravitational interaction @xmath5 gev which is often considered as a fundamental scale of physics .",
    "recently , however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the essence of the hierarchy problem can be drastically changed in the presence of reasonably large extra dimensions . in particular , in the context of @xmath6 -dimensional theory , with 1 time and @xmath7 spatial coordinates",
    ", one can consider a picture when the standard model ( sm ) particles are localized on a 3-brane identified with the observed 3-dimensional space , while gravity propagates in the full @xmath6-dimensional bulk with @xmath8 compact dimensions .",
    "in this situation the fundamental scale of gravitational interaction could be as low as @xmath9 few tev , whereas the observed weakness of the newtonian constant is due to the large size of extra dimensions ( @xmath10 tev@xmath11 ) .",
    "the effective planck scale @xmath12 of the 4-dimensional theory is related to @xmath13 via the large volume @xmath14 of the internal space as @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the hierarchy problem between @xmath16 and @xmath13 is  nullified  but now it can be reformulated as a question to why the extra dimensions have a size @xmath17 much larger than fundamental planck length @xmath18 . at distances larger than the typical size of these extra dimensions",
    "gravitational potential goes to its standard newton s form .",
    "moreover , all currently known experimental data including that of astrophysical as well as cosmological constraints can be barely satisfied by the above theoretical construction in the case of two or more extra dimensions , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "recent developments in string theory have revealed an interesting possibility that the string scale  @xmath20  may be much lower than the fundamental planck scale  @xmath12 @xcite and perhaps as low as @xmath21few tev @xcite . as it is well known , any consistent superstring theory has two parameters : a mass scale  @xmath20  and dimensionless string coupling  @xmath22  given by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dilaton field . upon the compactification of extra dimensions",
    "these parameters determine the four - dimensional planck mass  @xmath12 and a single dimensionless gauge coupling  @xmath23 at the string scale @xmath20 .",
    "thus , in the context of string theory we have to achieve an unification of the sm gauge couplings at @xmath20 , while they are known substantially differ from each other at currently available energies .",
    "however , the extrapolation of gauge couplings from their precisely measured values at @xmath24-peak to higher energies according to the ordinary 4-dimensional renormalization flow gives the unification scale around @xmath25 gev , much higher than the electroweak scale ..",
    "one possibility to achieve a low  scale ( @xmath0(tev ) ) gauge coupling unification is to consider the possibility that the number of space - time dimensions experienced by the sm fields are rised when the sm  gauge couplings are running on their way to the unification point , i.e. to assume the presence of some extra dimensions with radii larger than @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to change in the evolution of the gauge couplings from 4-dimensional logarithmic to higher - dimensional power ",
    "low and , hence , accelerates unification in an energy region where the theory becomes high dimensional .",
    "considerable interest to this possibility was renewed by the first indication of unification of gauge couplings extrapolated from one  loop calculation @xcite .",
    "after more accurate test of the minimal scenario it became evident that in order to justify the unification condition @xcite an extension of the sm  or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  is required .",
    "typically , to improve the unification picture of the minimal scenario , one considers the models with extra vector  like matter @xcite or extended sm gauge symmetry @xcite or when the susy breaking scale is large than the compactification scale @xcite , but both are order of tev .    in this connection the following question might be naturally raised : _ what kind of extension of the sm or mssm are needed to achieve the low - scale gauge coupling unification just in four dimensions without help of extra dimensions ? _",
    "if such models can be constructed then they can be also considered from the point of view of a possible resolution of the unification problem in various higher dimensional models where the sm fields are restricted to be stuck on a 3-brane and thus do not feel the extra dimensions at all .",
    "this might be the situation within the millimeter size extra dimensions @xcite or within the models with non  compact extra dimensions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study systematically the group - theoretical constraints on the gauge coupling @xmath26-functions that ensure  tev  scale unification in the  susy  as well as in the  non - susy cases .",
    "we find a certain set of new particles which modify properly the running of the gauge couplings driving them to unify at energies around the  tev  scale .",
    "it is remarkable that such particles can be easily observed at future colluders .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a general analysis of the gauge coupling unification and determine how",
    "the corresponding @xmath26-factors should be modified in order to have successful low - scale unification .",
    "based on this analysis we give some explicit examples of extra matter multiplets which provide the gauge coupling unification at the two - loop level . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss some possibilities how to circumvent the proton decay problem which we face in low - scale gut models .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we present our conclusions .",
    "let us start by considering general aspects of the gauge coupling unification at one - loop level .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath27 of the standard gauge factors @xmath28 at low energies are known with a quite good accuracy .",
    "namely , the world averages for the values @xmath29 at @xmath24-peak are the following @xcite : @xmath30 the running constants @xmath31 at higher energies , @xmath32 , can be calculated by the standard renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "the fact of the gauge coupling unification means that the all three running constants become equal at some scale @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 . in principle , starting from some scale @xmath35 , the theory may include some extra particle states @xmath36 in non - trivial representations of @xmath28 , with masses @xmath37 . in this case , the one - loop rg equations relating @xmath38 to @xmath39 and @xmath40 read as : @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the standard one - loop @xmath26-coefficients .",
    "namely , in the standard model we have @xmath44 , while in the mssm @xmath45 .. ] the second term in ( [ rg ] ) stands for the contribution of extra particles @xmath36 , with one - loop coefficients @xmath46 which depend on the representation content of the latter .",
    "one can introduce the effective coefficients @xmath47 which extrapolate eqs .",
    "( [ rg ] ) as @xmath48 > from here follows that @xmath49 and for the difference of the effective @xmath26-coefficients @xmath50 we obtain : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as for the unification scale and the unified gauge constant , we have respectively : @xmath54    hence , the criterion for the gauge coupling crossing at one scale is encoded into the condition : @xmath55 in other words , the theoretical ratio @xmath56 which depends on the extra particle content and their mass splitting , should coincide with the quantity @xmath57 which is determined by the experimental values of the gauge coupling constants ( [ exp ] ) . in particular , for @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 , with the uncertainty corresponding to @xmath60 error - bars in eqs .",
    "( [ exp ] ) . for @xmath61",
    "larger than @xmath62 , we obtain from ( [ rgz ] ) : @xmath63 therefore , for @xmath61 in the range up to tev or so the values of @xmath57 remain very close to @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in particular ,",
    "in the mssm we have @xmath65 with a very good accuracy while in the sm we obtain @xmath66 $ ] , where the correction is comparable to uncertainty in @xmath64 itself .",
    "the values of @xmath57 for @xmath67 calculated in 1 and 2-loops are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in particular , in the sm case , without the extra particle contribution , the unification condition is not satisfied : we have @xmath68 , about 17 standard deviations away from the range @xmath59 .",
    "however , in the mssm we have @xmath69 , in a wanderful agreement with @xmath64 . in this way , we have once again demonstrated the remarkable success of the supersymmetric grand unification @xcite . since the mssm yields rather small values of @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ", the gauge coupling unification occurs at very large scale , @xmath73 gev , which also renders the proton to be enough long - living . on the other hand ,",
    "lower @xmath74 would need the larger values of the coefficients @xmath70 which should be achieved due to the contribution of the extra particles . in particular , for achieving the unification at the scale @xmath74 order few tev one has to choose the representation content of the extra states @xmath36 so that the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 are large , @xmath77 , and they are related as in eq .",
    "( [ unif ] ) . the required correlation @xmath78 as well as the values of the unification scale as a function of @xmath75",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in order to define better the rules of the game ,",
    "let us assume that extra particles may have masses from few hundred gev to few tev . in the standard model context they can present in the form of new scalars or vector - like fermions . in the mssm context",
    "one has to introduce chiral superfields in vector - like or self - adjoint representations .",
    "such massive states would not affect the phenomenology of the standard model and also would satisfy the anomaly cancellation conditions .",
    "clearly , for achieving the big values of @xmath76 in more economic way , one has to increase @xmath79 without increasing much @xmath80 . in other words",
    ", one has to introduce as few as possible extra states with the non - trivial colour content , and ultimately one could restrict himself only by the colour singlet states . moreover , too many colour states would violate the asymptotic freedom of @xmath81 so that the gauge coupling crossing could occur in the strong coupling regime where the perturbation theory is no more valid , or even in the unphysical region with the negative @xmath82 . in particular , in order the evolution of @xmath83 to higher energies does not change the slope to a negative value , we need @xmath84 to be less than 7 in the case of the sm , or less than 3 in the mssm context .",
    "this simplifies our selection rules for the representation content of the extra states .",
    "the low scale unification of the gauge couplings should be achieved essentially due to the contributions of the colour singlet extra states - sort of heavy leptons .",
    "we have also to demand that electric charges @xmath85 of these states are integer , which means that the isospin @xmath86 and hypercharge @xmath87 should be related as @xmath88 , @xmath89 being any integer .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the supersymmetric case , with extra matter in the form of vector - like pairs of the colour singlet chiral superfields in @xmath90 representations @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the dimension of @xmath93 representation .",
    "these fields should form massive states with the mass terms @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    ", i.e. the ones with @xmath96 and @xmath6 being the odd number , can have also majorana like mass terms @xmath97 . ]",
    "each of the superfields @xmath36 and @xmath98 contribute the one - loop @xmath26 coefficients as follows : , with the hypercharges @xmath99 , @xmath89 being any integer .",
    "their contributions in the @xmath26 coefficients are : @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in order to maintain the asymptotic freedom of @xmath81 , the @xmath93 dimension of these multiplets should not be very large , @xmath103 . ]",
    "@xmath104    obviously , the existence of extra heavy states , with masses in the range from few hundred gev to tev can be directly tested in the future colliders .",
    "in addition , these states may contain the particles with the same quantum numbers as ordinary leptons and quarks , which can also have impact for the mass generation mechanism of the latter , in the spirit of the mechanism @xcite .",
    "since the mass scale of the heavy states is close to the electroweak scale , then in general one could expect some violation of the universality ( unitarity ) of the ckm mixing and additional contributions to the flavour changing phenomena .",
    "one can further simplify a situation and consider all extra particles having the same mass , @xmath105 . in this case the eq .",
    "( [ b - eff ] ) reduces to @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , our goal is to select the representation content of the extra @xmath36 particles so that the non - standard contributions in @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath77 , and their ratio is @xmath107 . in particular , one can choose the representations which predict @xmath108 , as it holds in the case of the mssm .",
    "clearly , many different solutions can be envisaged . for example",
    ", one can consider extra states consisting exclusively of heavy replicas of the ordinary lepton species , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , for simplicity all located at the same scale @xmath61 .",
    "then , if we take their multiplicities as @xmath111 and @xmath112 , with @xmath113 being any integer number , we obtain @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and so @xmath116 . on the other hand , for having the low scale unification",
    ", @xmath113 should be large number .",
    "for example , for @xmath117 gev , the unification scale @xmath118 tev can be obtained only if @xmath119 . but consider the mass splitting between these states .",
    "for instance , @xmath120 tev can be achieved by taking 42 copies for each of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , with @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 tev . ]",
    "another possibility is to seek for just one big representation which could do a job alone .",
    "a candidate we have found is a vector - like multiplet @xmath125 .",
    "it leads to @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and hence @xmath128 .",
    "these coefficients are enough big , @xmath129 , to provide @xmath74 order tev . and",
    "finally , one can consider a mixed situation , containing some big representations appended by few small ones .",
    "some possible candidates are given below .",
    "a subtle questions which arise here is whether the solutions found in 1-loop approximation will be stable against 2-loop corrections .",
    "this question seems most challenging for the solutions with large representations in which case the 2-loop rg effects are expected to be significant .",
    "therefore , one needs to examine the 2-loop rg equations : @xmath130 where @xmath131 are the 1-loop @xmath26-coefficients , with @xmath46 fiven as in eq .",
    "( [ deltab - l ] ) , and @xmath132 are the 2-loop ones . in the mssm",
    "the standard 2-loop coefficients are given by the matrix : @xmath133 while the non - standard contributions can be calculated as @xcite : @xmath134    the two loop corrections significantly affect the solutions with small representations",
    ". however , a remarkable thing occurs for the solutions with large representations : the fact of the gauge coupling unification remains robust , whereas naively one would expect strong violations since the 2-loop effects normally become bigger with bigger representations .",
    "the reason of the stability of the unification condition has a simple explanation . to demonstrate this ,",
    "it is convenient to approximate the two - loop rg predictions as follows : @xmath135 one can rewrite these equations in a form analogous to 1-loop extrapolation ( [ rg - eff ] ) : @xmath136 where @xmath137 then the gauge coupling crossing condition becomes @xmath138 hence , the stability of the 1-loop solution with satisfying ( [ unif ] ) implies that the ratio of 2-loop factors @xmath139 should remain close to the ratio of 1-loop factors @xmath140 .",
    "we found the solutions by solving numerically the precise 2-loop equations as well .",
    "namely , first we justify the unification condition ( [ unif ] ) , by selecting the particle states with appropriate quantum numbers which could ensure the desired modification of @xmath26-factors at one - loop",
    ". then we test these solutions by numerical analysis at two - loop level .",
    "as it was expected from the above analysis , the case of large multiplet @xmath125 which satisfies the 1-loop criterion of the gauge coupling crossing ( [ unif ] ) , @xmath108 , is perfectly stable in two - loops .",
    "however , the value of unification scale changes significantly .",
    "namely , by taking the mass scale @xmath117 gev , we had @xmath145 tev at 1-loop , while at 2-loops we obtain @xmath146 tev .",
    "the list of some mixed solutions is given below .",
    "they all imply @xmath108 at 1-loop and are stable against 2-loop rg analysis .",
    "we show the @xmath90 content and multiplicities of the chiral superfields ( plus their conjugates ) and the unification scales at 1- and 2-loops respectively .",
    "@xmath147    in the case of solutions with only small representations @xmath148 and @xmath149 , with @xmath150 and @xmath151 , the coupling crossing does not occur anymore within @xmath60 error - bars in @xmath152 , and it requires about @xmath153 deviation . in order to obtain the coupling crossing at @xmath60 level ,",
    "on has to change the number of fields , namely to take @xmath154 and @xmath151 , which at one - loop would correspond to @xmath155 .",
    "on the other hand , the unification scale does not change substantially and remains around @xmath156 tev .",
    "an interesting issue is whether the coupling constant crossing can really correspond to the possibility that at the scale @xmath157 of a few tev three gauge gauge factors @xmath28 are indeed embedded in some grand unified group .",
    "the main obstacle for the realization of the consistent gut scenario is the problem of proton stability . indeed ,",
    "if the quark and lepton fields are unified into the @xmath158 multiplets @xmath159 and @xmath160 , @xmath161 , then the processes mediated by the heavy gauge bosons @xmath162 and @xmath87 of @xmath158 with masses @xmath163 will lead to the catastrophically fast proton decay .",
    "nevertheless , several ways out can be envisaged .",
    "one possible scenario for the suppression of the proton decay can be thought as follows .",
    "suppose the gauge @xmath158 theory which is in the confining phase outside the 3 + 1-dimensional domain wall ( 3-brane ) produced by some master field @xmath164 , a singlet of @xmath158 .",
    "however on the 3-brane , due to the appropriate coupling with the master field @xmath164 , some adjoint scalar field @xmath165 is triggered to develop the @xmath28 preserving vev , @xmath166 .",
    "then , according to the dvali - shifman mechanism @xcite , all gauge fields of the standard model are localized on the 3-brane , while the massive ( on the 3-brane ) @xmath162 and @xmath87 bosons freely propagate in the bulk .",
    "now , assuming also that chiral matter fields in @xmath167 representations of @xmath158 are confined on the 3-brane their effective 4-dimensional couplings to @xmath162 and @xmath87 bosons could be suppressed by the volume - factor comming from the integration out of extra coordinates in the effective lagrangian : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the volume of compact internal space with @xmath113 extra dimensions of radius @xmath17 .",
    "the rough estimation shows that the case of @xmath170 extra dimensions with @xmath171 mm is perfectly safe to satisfy experimental bounds on the proton lifetime even if the unification scale is around tev .",
    "the obvious trouble with the above mechanism is related with the colour triplet partner of the electroweak doublet .",
    "the point is that , as long as gluons are confined on the brane the coloured higgs has to be restricted on the brane as well , due to the colour flux conservation argument @xcite .",
    "this coloured higgs ( as well as its superpartner , higgsino ) can mediate fast proton decay , unless it is completely decoupled from the quarks and leptons .",
    "such a decoupling can be indeed achieved in some extended guts ( say , in @xmath172 gut ) thanks to the special pattern of the gut symmetry breaking ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "another way is to simply remove the fundamental higgs from the theory , attributing the electroweak symmetry breaking to some dynamical mechanism involving say the top - antitop condensation @xcite .",
    "another possibility of keeping baryon and /or lepton numbers approximately conserved in 4-dimensions and thus suppressing the proton decay up to a desired level is offered by the mechanism of ref .",
    "it reveals to the field - theoretic localization of chiral matter on a fat 3 + 1-dimensional domain wall ( 3-brane ) when the quarks and leptons are localized at a different points along the extra coordinate .",
    "this mechanism is also compatible with gut models , providing that gut symmetry , say @xmath158 , is broken down to the @xmath28 by the vev of the bulk adjoint field @xmath173 .",
    "the higher - dimensional model is initially vector - like , so along with the usual @xmath174 representations for each family of ordinary quarks and leptons there are mirror fermions @xmath175 as well . in the bulk",
    "the dirac masses of the quarks and leptons residing in quintuplets and decuplets are splitted as a result of gut symmetry breaking according to the following equations : @xmath176 here we omit yukawa constants and family indeces for simplicitly ; @xmath177 and @xmath178 are @xmath158 invariant masses for the quintuplets and decuplets , respectively .",
    "the matter fields above are assumed to couple with the master scalar field ( @xmath158-singlet ) @xmath179 as well .",
    "this scalar field  produce ",
    "the domain wall @xmath180 with a certain thikness @xmath181",
    ". then , as it is well known , only the chiral matter ( e.g. @xmath174 ) get localized on the domain wall . the points where the wave functions of the quarks and leptons are peaked are actually different ( schematically we denote them as @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively ) due to the precence of the @xmath158-breaking vev of @xmath165 in ( [ pd1 ] ) and are determined by the equations : @xmath184 thus , any transition between quarks and leptons in 4 dimensions will contain an exponetial suppression factor @xmath185 , since the interactions are non - local in extra dimension .",
    "this exponential factor suitably adjusted could indeed suppress the proton decay up to a desired level .",
    "perhaps the most natural realization of such gut models can be found within the higher - dimensional theories when certain symmetries inherited from the compactified internal space can be used to prevent the rapid proton decay .",
    "one of such intrinsically higher - dimensional mechanism has been proposed in @xcite where the minimal susy @xmath158 was considered in 5 dimensions compactified on @xmath186 orbifold .",
    "the chiral matter ( i.e. ordinary quarks and leptons and their superparners ) in @xcite is assumed to be located at the orbifold fixed point , while gauge fields and possibly higgs fields as well are allowed to propagate in the full 5-dimensional bulk .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath162 and @xmath87 bosons ( and the colored higgs as well ) are odd under the @xmath187 orbifold parity , one can totally decouple them from the quarks and leptons , so that they could not be responsible for the proton decay .",
    "finally , one could construct the gut models with absolutely stabile proton just in 4 dimensions .",
    "for some models constructed in the past see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the obvious candidates for such a guts are the models with discretely covered gut symmetry , such as @xmath188 trinification or @xmath189-type theories with approprately chosen matter representations . in such models typically there are no @xmath162 and @xmath87 gauge bosons ( or they are not responcible for the transition of ordinary quarks into leptons and vice versa ) and thus there is no gauge mediation of the proton decay . as to the coloured higgs ( higgsino ) mediation of proton decay",
    "one can still use one of the mechanism described above .",
    "moreover , one can construct the gut models based on the simple groups as well . as an instructive example we scotch here @xmath158 gut with special fermion assignment .",
    "namely , imagine that the theory contains 5 states @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and 3 anti - states @xmath36 and @xmath192 per each generation , among the other possible vector - like states .",
    "imagine also that @xmath158 symmetry is broken by the fields @xmath193 and @xmath194 , both in the reducible @xmath195 representations , having the following  orthogonal  vev patterns : @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "there is also one extra @xmath195 field @xmath173 which develops vev of the form @xmath198 .",
    "note , however , that all this fields and their vevs more naturally look in the context of guts higher than @xmath158 .",
    "e.g. in @xmath199 they can emerge from the mixed representations like @xmath200 .",
    "let us now consider the following superpotential terms : @xmath201 then , the vevs of @xmath202 @xmath203 and @xmath173 pick up the @xmath204 @xmath205 , @xmath206 @xmath207 , @xmath208 @xmath209 , @xmath210 @xmath211 and @xmath212 as an ordinary massless quarks and leptons of the sm , while all other states get masses from the couplings in ( [ su5 ] ) . at this stage , keeping only massless states as an external ones and while considering all massive states as those of possible intermediate , one can define five separately conserved global charges .",
    "they are : @xmath213 where @xmath113 denotes the particle number operator .",
    "now , whatever mechanism is responsible for the generation of the masses for the sm quarks and leptons above , it is evident that @xmath214 and @xmath207 will couple to @xmath215 and @xmath216 respectively and @xmath211 will couple to @xmath217 as well .",
    "thus , the only two combinations of charges in ( [ ch ] ) will survive as an unbroken ones .",
    "namely , @xmath218 separately conserved .",
    "they are the lepton @xmath219 number and the baryon number @xmath220 .",
    "thus , the proton is stabile in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the following remark is in order .",
    "one could ask , what can be the origin of the `` leptonic '' fragments @xmath221 in big representations of @xmath90 considered in previous section , which are needed to properly correct the rg evolution of the gauge couplings .",
    "clearly , these can naturally emerge from the gut superfields in big representations .",
    "for example , consider the @xmath158 superfields in @xmath222-index symmetric representations @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "one can consider the couplings @xmath225 with the higgs @xmath226 having the vev @xmath227 .",
    "clearly , this would give order @xmath74 mass to all fragments in @xmath86 and @xmath228 apart of the fragments @xmath229 ( all indices from @xmath93 subgroup ) .",
    "any other `` leptonic '' superfield in representations @xmath230 can be left light by the interaction with the higgs @xmath226 by proper choice of the corresponding big @xmath158 representation , while any fragment with at least one colour index would get mass order @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the extra particle states needed for correcting the rg evolution of the gauge couplings for achieving the tev scale unification can be obtained by the same `` missing vev '' mechanism which also guarantees the fermion mass arangement rendering the proton stable and also leaves the higgs doublets light .",
    "we have demonstrated that the the unification of @xmath231 gauge couplings at very low scale can be achieved in four dimensions with the help of not so little friends - some extra particles in rather big representations of @xmath90 at some intermediate scales between few hundred gev and tev . in this case",
    "no power like rg evolution has to be invoked in extra dimensions .",
    "these particles can be directly observed at the future accelerators and have many phenomenological implications .",
    "theoretical models can be constructed in which the garnd unification occurs at tev scales but proton remains stable .",

    "<S> the gauge coupling constant unification at the low ( @xmath0(tev ) ) scale can be obtained just in four dimensions , without help of the power like renormalization group evolution in extra dimensions , due to the presence of some extra particle states at intermediate scales . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicit examples of such extra states in the range of 100 gev  1 tev which can be easily observed on future colliders and can have important impact on the particle phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the problems of the low scale grand unification and proton stability are also discussed .    </S>",
