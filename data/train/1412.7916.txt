    ", there is relatively little activity in the outer arm in the second and third quadrants .",
    "this makes it challenging to accurately trace its structure and determine kinematic properties .",
    "trigonometric parallax distances , @xmath3 , have been measured for only three 22 ghz water maser sources in the outer arm : @xmath4 kpc for g075.30 + 01.32 ( sanna et al .",
    "2012 ) , @xmath5 kpc for wb 89437 ( g135.27 + 02.79 ) ( hachisuka et al . 2009 ) , and @xmath6 kpc ( honma et al .",
    "2007 ) or @xmath7 kpc ( asaki et al . 2014 ) for s 269 ( g196.4501.67 ) .",
    "while clearly more astrometric data are desirable in order to better understand the properties of the outer arm , few maser sources have been discovered , owing to the low star formation rate and general weakness of these masers ( e.g. wouterloot et al .",

    "astrometry with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) can yield trigonometric parallaxes with accuracies better than @xmath8  and is an excellent tool to study galactic structure and dynamics ( e.g. reid et al .",

    "we report parallaxes and proper motions of three water masers associated with high - mass star - forming regions ( hmsfrs ) : g@xmath9 , g@xmath10 and g@xmath11 .",
    "these measurements are part of the bar and spiral structure legacy ( bessel ) survey and double the number of sources with accurate parallaxes in the outer arm .",
    "we used the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) very long baseline array ( vlba ) to observe 22 ghz water maser sources under programs br145 g , h , and v. we observed with four adjacent 8 mhz bands in right and left circular polarization , with the second band centered on the water maser . the continuum and line data were correlated with the vlba difx , producing 16 and 256 spectral channels per band , respectively .",
    "additionally , we placed four `` geodetic blocks '' throughout each seven hour track , as described in reid ( 2009a ) , in order to measure and remove residual tropospheric delays relative to the correlator model .",
    "the parallax observations involved rapid switching between compact extragalactic continuum sources and water maser sources . for each maser source , we observed at six epochs spanning one year ( see tables  [ table:1 ] and [ table:1 - 2 ] for details ) , with a sequence designed to yield good parallax results for a maser spot that might last only seven months .",
    "data reduction was performed using the nrao astronomical image processing system , as described in reid et al .",

    "the water masers were detected at all epochs , and generally we chose a strong , compact maser spot to use as the interferometer phase reference . the second continuum source associated with g@xmath12 ,",
    "while detected at the first epoch , was not useful for parallax results owing to its large angular separation ( @xmath13 ) from the maser ."
