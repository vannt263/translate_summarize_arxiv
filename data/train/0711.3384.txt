    "mean - field theory of spin glasses is now almost complete .",
    "it took more than thirty years from the introduction of a mean - field model by sherrington and kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite before we understood its solution and in particular its physical meaning .",
    "the core of the mean - field solution was set rather early by parisi in his replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scheme @xcite .",
    "parisi used , however , the replica trick and a formal procedure of breaking a symmetry in the ( unphysical ) replica space when the limit to zero number of mathematical replicas is performed . since",
    "then theorists have striven hard to understand the physical meaning of the parisi solution and to find alternative ways of its derivation in order to prove its completeness .",
    "the effort paid off .",
    "we now have reached solid understanding of the physics behind the rsb solution @xcite and there is a mathematical proof of exactness of the rsb construction in the sk model @xcite .",
    "this is not the only output of the extensive investigation of mean - field spin - glass systems .",
    "the statistical methods developed by studying the infinite - range spin - glass systems found broad application in interdisciplinary fields such as informatics , optimisation and computational complexity , econophysics and biophysics and other frustrated complex and open systems .",
    "although our understanding of the mean - field theory of spin glasses is in global attributes satisfactory , there still remain a few issues that deserve a more detailed and specific clarification .",
    "one of such questions is the eventual form of the replica - symmetry - breaking solution .",
    "any derivation of a stable equilibrium spin - glass state uses the so - called discrete rsb scheme with finite - many hierarchical levels of the order parameters .",
    "parisi assumed that in the sk model one needs infinite number of rsb hierarchies and derived an implicit formula for the free energy of the sk model with a continuous order - parameter function .",
    "the latter is now considered as the exact solution of the sk model .",
    "unfortunately , the parisi formula for the averaged free energy of the sk model is only implicit and no explicit global solution exists .",
    "moreover , the mathematical proof of exactness of the rsb construction does not specify whether a discrete or the continuous rsb scheme produces the maximal free energy . at least in one model , a potts spin glass , the one - step rsb solution seems to be stable in a finite region of temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is hence important to understand when one should use the discrete rsb scheme with a finite number of order parameters and when the continuous limit is appropriate .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse properties of the discrete rsb scheme leading to solutions with a finite number of hierarchical levels of the order parameters .",
    "the emphasis is laid on the way the discrete scheme goes over to the continuous parisi solution in the limit of infinite - many rsb hierarchies .",
    "we show that the continuous limit is a process during which we reduce the degrees of freedom to a single continuous order - parameter function on a compact interval .",
    "we derive the continuous limit of the stationarity equations maximising the free energy with large but finite numbers of rsb hierarchies and thereby we obtain a functional equation for the order - parameter function from the parisi solution .",
    "we first derive the equations in the continuous limit generally and then we illustrate the process of building the continuous limit on the asymptotic expansion near the de almeida - thouless ( at ) instability line of the sk model in the external magnetic field .",
    "we explicitly evaluate the leading asymptotic contribution to the parisi order - parameter function .",
    "there is no direct way to the parisi free energy surpassing the concept of discrete replicas in one or another way .",
    "we can either use the replica trick to handle averaging over random configurations of the spin coupling @xcite or we can use real replicas with which we test thermodynamic homogeneity ( independence of boundary and initial conditions ) of the chosen macroscopic thermodynamic state @xcite . in each of these approaches",
    "one must extend the discrete multiplicity of the replicated phase space to a continuous parameter .",
    "this can be done only for a specific structure of the replicated phase space , namely a vertical tree containing only child replicas within parental ones .",
    "communication between replicas of the same generation materialises exclusively via one or more antecedent generations of replicas ( common ancestors ) .",
    "the phase space forms a hierarchical ultrametric structure .",
    "it is then natural to start the investigation of the rsb construction with the discrete scheme .",
    "a hierarchical character of the phase space of the sk model is expressed in a hierarchy of order parameters standing for generations of the replicated spins .",
    "each generation is characterised by a pair of numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the former `` geometric '' parameter expresses a probability with which the original spins are affected by spins from the replicated systems and the latter represents the strength with which the original and the replicated spins from the @xmath2th hierarchy interact @xcite . a phase space with @xmath3 hierarchies ( @xmath3rsb ) is characterised in addition to the sk order parameter @xmath4 also by @xmath3 pairs @xmath5 with @xmath6 . instead of parameters @xmath7 in the parisi notation",
