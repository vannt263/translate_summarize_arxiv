    "one of the most remarkable features of a quantum system is the ability of transporting electrons and atoms across classically forbidden regions . this process is allowed by means of a well known effect referred to as quantum tunneling . in semiconductor physics @xcite ,",
    "the use of a superlattice permits the enhancement of the transport along a specific spatial direction , supported , in a first approximation , by the resonant coupling between electronic levels . nowadays many of these solid state physics paradigms",
    "are amply investigated in a cleaner manner using ultracold atoms and optical potentials .",
    "the rapid advances in the experimental techniques have opened a huge field of research , in which the most common approaches to the description of many - particle physics are based on bose - hubbard - type hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "a basic feature of these hamiltonian models is that the kinetic energy is described by means of dynamical hoppings ( tunneling ) between different potential wells . here",
    ", we are extending such a model to higher energy bands coupled by means of an external stark force .",
    "the study of many - body effects at resonant tunneling conditions is not straightforward since , in the presence of strong correlations , the complexity is overwhemingly increased @xcite . for the single - particle and mean field limits ,",
    "there are up to date experimental realizations of the wannier - stark system ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , by investigating certain parameter regimes , for example , in the case of strongly interacting atoms ( hard core bosons ) , an effective description is possible by mapping the many - body lattice system to analytically solvable effective hamiltonians @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the resonant tunneling effect in a bose - hubbard model extended to a second excited bloch band .",
    "this system , that can be immediately realized in experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , has very interesting spectral properties .",
    "these allow for the study of many - body effects as , for example , interaction - induced quantum chaos @xcite , diffusion and relaxation in hilbert space @xcite and coherent dynamics in the weak interacting regime @xcite .",
    "we show that the main spectral properties can be captured in an effective theory based on upper - band manifold excitations , that can , in principle , be measured in experimental realizations such as reported in .",
    "our approach allows us to characterize : the onset of quantum chaos , to distiguish the condition for the emergence of localization in energy space @xcite , and to design the type of driving dynamics that can be implemented in analogy with the well - known landau - zener process @xcite .",
    "our system consists of ultracold bosonic atoms in a optical lattice @xcite subjected to an external stark force .",
    "the force stimulates @xmath0 the atomic transport along the lattice , for instance , atomic bloch oscillations @xcite , and @xmath1 between the bloch bands , e.g. landau - zener transitions @xcite .",
    "this latter process is characterized by the exchange of particles between the bands and is enhanced at specific values of force , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the energetic gap between the two bands . at those values ,",
    "resonantly enhanced tunneling takes place between wannier - stark levels distancing @xmath4 wells @xcite .",
    "the integer @xmath4 is from now on called the order of the resonance . in the following , we restrict to two coupled energy bands .",
    "such a situation is realized , e.g. , in a double - periodic lattice , see ref .",

    "the interband coupling is generated by dipole - like couplings ( @xmath11 ) and by the repulsive interaction ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the large dimensionality of the parameter space makes it impossible to analitically solve our problem .",
    "therefore a numerical procedure to find the eigensystem is required .",
    "we quickly summarize the procedure in the following , and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .      in order to study the eigenenergy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:01 ] ) ,",
    "we first implement a transformation into the interaction picture with respect to the external force . in this procedure",
    "the term @xmath13 is removed , and the hopping and dipole - like terms transform as : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the big advantage of the transformation into the interaction picture is that now the new hamiltonian is invariant under translation and periodic in time .",
    "its period is given by @xmath16 , which is known as the bloch period .",
    "we now set periodic boundary conditions in space , i.e. @xmath17 . in order to diagonalize the time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath18",
    ", we use the translationally invariant fock states @xmath19 defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , with dimension given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath22 the total particle number .",
    "we study the eigensystem of the floquet hamiltonian @xcite @xmath23 , whose eigenenergies @xmath24 are defined as the set of eigenvalues of @xmath25 lying within the floquet zone @xmath26 $ ] ( see details of the diagonalization procedure in @xcite ) . in the following we introduce an effective , analytical description of the spectral properties based on the upper - band excitation and its respective comparison with the exact numerical results .",
    "the non - interacting limit is described by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) with @xmath27 . here",
    "it is possible to construct a local hamiltonian around a single resonance @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the site @xmath28 may be connected to the upper - band lattice site @xmath29 ( @xmath4 sites to the left ) .",
    "we now rescale the hamiltonian as @xmath30 , where @xmath3 is typically the largest parameter ; thus we have @xmath31 , which means that only working with the largest dipole strength , @xmath32 , is enough to capture the essential features of the system .",
    "the effective hamiltonian around the resonance of order @xmath4 reads @xmath33\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum^l_{l=1}\\omega_bc_0\\left(\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{l}\\hat{b}_l+h.c.\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the energy separation between the bloch bands is @xmath34 .",
    "we then have a hamiltonian consisting of two tilted lattices .",
    "the eigenenergies of the independent lattices are given by the wannier - stark ladder formula @xcite : @xmath35    in the case @xmath36 , that is , without inter - band coupling and no tilt , the eigenstates of eq .",

    "[ fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , the hamiltonian can be reduced to a tight - binding - type one for the upper - band excitation manifolds ( from now on labeled by @xmath39 ) when describing the averaged one - particle exchange processes in the resonant system . to do this",
    ", we use the closure relation @xmath47 , which can be rewritten in terms of the manifold projectors @xmath48 as follows @xmath49    here @xmath50 is a fock state with @xmath39 particles in the upper band .",
    "the projectors @xmath51 allow one to rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath52 with the eigenstate @xmath53 of @xmath54 expanded as latexmath:[\\ ] ]    shows that the transition from weak to strong mixing is determined by the competition between one- and two - particle exchange between the bands .",
    "this competition is the stronger the closer we are in resonance , at which we have that @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that for a filling factor @xmath141 , single- and two - particle transitions have the same occurrence probability , which makes the system strongly mixed . in the case",
    "@xmath142 , the dominant effect is a one - particle exchange characterized by the energy scale @xmath143 , and similarly for @xmath144 , the two - particle exchange process dominates with energy scale proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "these two latter cases favor the weak manifold mixing .",
    "therefore , the eigenstates of ( [ eq:01 ] ) are expected to be localized in energy space according to the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "so far , we have studied the properties of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:01 ] ) by using rather simple approximations based on the concept of manifold excitation .",
    "the results have shown to be in a good agreement with the numerical ones .",
    "we now show two direct consequences of the spectral properties ; first we briefly describe the implementation of landau - zener - type dynamics by making the stark force time - dependent . in this way , driving individual eigenstates @xmath145 across an avoided crossing may be straightforwardly implemented .",
    "secondly , we study the connection between strong manifold mixing and quantum chaos in the resonant tunneling regime .",
    "around a local resonance , our system provides a natural scenario for the study of landau - zener - type transitions .",
    "this can be done by defining a pulse @xmath146 , with @xmath147 . here",
    "@xmath148 is the effective region of resonant tunneling and @xmath149 is the sweeping time .",
    "we focus on the dynamical driving of a state from the lowest manifold @xmath123 for the single - particle case .",
    "we have then two manifolds @xmath150 and the spectrum of this system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "we define the sweeping rate @xmath151 using the heisenberg relation @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is mean level spacing at @xmath112 .",
    "the hamiltonian is now time - dependent , @xmath154 , and the temporal evolution is computed by using a fourth - order runge - kutta method . in analogy with the lz problem , the evolution across an avoided crossing can be diabatic , non - adiabatic and adiabatic . in the current case",
    "the dynamical regimes are determinated by the parameter @xmath155 .",
    "thus for @xmath156 we have slow driving through resonances , i.e. , an adiabatic passage ; for @xmath157 a diabatic one , also referred to as sudden quench , and for @xmath158 we have a non - adiabatic evolution .    to follow the evolution of a state across the ret regime , we compute the detection probabilities @xmath159 , where @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "the distribution probability of the evolved wavefunction in the local energy space can be represented by means of the local density of states @xcite : @xmath161    with the delta function defined as @xmath162    in figure [ fig:3 ] we show the evolution of the ldos @xmath163 in the single particle case @xmath164 , i.e. the hamiltonian @xmath165 in eq .",

    "the spectrum must be unfolded in order to compare with the random matrix distributions , i.e. , such that @xmath190 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    at the resonances",
    "@xmath112 , the crossover between regular ( poisson ) , @xmath191 , and quantum chaotic ( goe ) statistics , @xmath192 , is reached by varying the inter - particle interaction .",
    "we define the parameter @xmath187 , that allows one to tune the interaction , i.e. , @xmath193 . in the experiment",
    "this can be done via feschbach resonances @xcite . as expected from the discussion in subsection [ sec:2d ] , for an energy band gap @xmath194 and @xmath195 , all systems with @xmath141 exhibit chaotic features characterized by the goe distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a)-black ) . nevertheless , this is not a general rule for every interaction strength , since for weakly interacting particles the manifold mixing becomes weaker .",

    "[ fig:4](b ) .",
    "we see that our two - band model allows us to concentrate a high density of many - body energy levels around a resonance , which induces the chaotic features of the system .",
    "this is not the case far from the resonant regime , since here the system is just weakly mixed due to the presence of the @xmath39-manifolds .",

    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "we thus see that the mixing properties of our system allow for a straightforward identification of the onset of quantum chaos , which is a local effect in the plane @xmath24 vs @xmath204 .",
    "nevertheless , a globally chaotic spectrum can also be reached by decreasing the energy bandgap @xmath3 such that @xmath205 . in this case , not only resonant tunneling between two neighboring wells due to the stark force is possible , but also via interaction @xcite .",
    "these two processes are equally relevant and , as immediate signature of this , the local resonances are destroyed .",
