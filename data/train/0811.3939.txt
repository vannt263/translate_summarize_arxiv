    "the dust in jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) is considered to be pristine , that is , little or no processing of the dust has occurred since incorporation into the comet nucleus .",
    "we do not equate pristine dust with pre - solar dust .",
    "the presence of crystalline silicates in the dust comae of jfcs and oort cloud ( oc ) comets , and the absence of crystalline silicates in the interstellar medium ( @xmath0% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strongly suggests that much of the dust in comets has been thermally processed ( @xmath1  k ) .",
    "strong radiogenic heating may occur in comets of sufficiently large ( radius , @xmath2 , @xmath320  km ) porous and dust rich nuclei @xcite , but the presence of highly volatile molecules , such as co and/or co@xmath4 observed in the comae of 9p / tempel @xcite , 21p / giacobini - zinner @xcite , and 103p / hartley @xcite , suggests that comet interiors formed at very low temperatures ( as low as @xmath5  k for co to condense ) and have since remained cold @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous presence of low - temperature and high - temperature solar nebula condensates in comet nuclei is possible if thermally processed dust can be mixed from the hot inner - solar nebula into the cold comet forming zone ( heliocentric distance , @xmath6 , @xmath7  au ) perhaps by turbulent diffusion @xcite or by large - scale radial ( meridional ) flows @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectroscopy ( @xmath8  ) is an effective technique for assessing the composition of comet dust in a large number of comets : 1 ) the peak thermal emission output from comet dust at @xmath94.0  au is at @xmath10  ; 2 ) the mid - ir covers prominent emission features from silicate minerals , a major constituent of comet dust ; and 3 ) only low to moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath11 ) is required to critically assess the composition of comet dust . by studying the physical properties of dust ejected by comet nuclei , we gain insight into the formation mechanism of dust in the solar nebula , and the structure and dynamics of the proto - planetary disk ( ppd ) .    through comparisons between dust in the interstellar medium , interplanetary dust grains @xcite , comet dust , and asteroidal materials",
    ", we may attempt to ascertain the extent to which ppd processes altered pre - solar dust and mixed it throughout the comet forming zone @xcite .",
    "being a mixture of pre - solar and solar nebula processed material , measuring the composition of comet dust helps us understand both the origin of the constituents of the primitive solar system , and their subsequent evolution into planetesimals @xcite . in a similar vein , we can use jfcs to learn about the compositions of scattered disk objects since these bodies are dynamically linked @xcite and therefore their dust properties may be related .",
    "in contrast , kuiper belt objects from the classical disk likely formed in situ , and represent a population of icy bodies separate from the scattered disk objects and comet nuclei .",
    "indeed , kuiper belt objects have redder surface colors , on average , than comet nuclei @xcite , indicating that they have a different origin or evolutionary history .    since",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy is effective at measuring comet dust properties , it offers important insight into the structure of the ppd .",
    "we can use mid - ir observations of comet dust to explore the heterogeneity of the ppd on sub - kilometer and super - kilometer ( i.e. , possibly tens of au ) scales by measuring the heterogeneity of comet nuclei .",
    "dust may be ejected into the comet coma from a localized region on the nucleus at different epochs either by natural or unnatural processes , e.g. , seasonal variations in insolation , outbursts , or collisions ( _ deep impact_-like events or natural ) .",
    "if the dust composition of the ambient coma differs from the localized regions , then we may conclude that the comet nucleus is heterogeneous .",
    "nucleus heterogeneity could arise from the aggregation of varied planetesimals ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and evidence for heterogeneity implies the proto - planetary disk in the comet forming regions was heterogeneous on kilometer to sub - kilometer sized scales ( the typical radius of a comet nucleus is of order 1  km ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the dust properties of individual nuclei could be relatively homogeneous , yet the dust compositions vary from comet - to - comet .",
    "this second scenario favors ppd heterogeneities on the super - kilometer scale .",
    "a taxonomy of comets classified according to their dust properties has the promise to provide evidence supporting local ( spatial or temporal ) variations in dust composition in the comet forming region of the ppd .",
    "evidence for chemical heterogeneity on both sub- and super - kilometer scales has been discovered through observations of comet gas species @xcite , e.g. , the c@xmath4 comet classes @xcite , the organic chemistry classes @xcite , the apparent co variability of comet 21p / giacobini - zinner @xcite , and the co@xmath4 and h@xmath4o composition of comet 9p / tempel @xcite .    in this paper , we review the composition of jupiter - family comets as inferred from infrared spectroscopy : in  [ sec : obs ] we review mid - ir spectroscopic observations of jfcs ; in  [ sec : silicates ] we summarize and discuss observations of silicate mineralogy in jfcs , we demonstrate (  [ sec : nucleus ] ) that the silicate feature strength is increased by subtracting emission from the nucleus , but not increased enough to match the strong silicate features of some oc comets , and from this perspective we discuss opportunities for important observations in the future ; in  [ sec : tempel ] we review the mid - ir observations and models of comet 9p / tempel in the context of the _ deep impact _",
    "mission ; in  [ sec:9p - discussion ] we discuss the potential significance to our understanding of ppd processes of the detection of hydrated and fe - rich minerals identified in comet 9p / tempel ; and , in  [ sec : summary ] we summarize the review .",
    "mid - infrared spectra , with @xmath12 , exist for 13 jupiter - family comets and these observations are summarized in table  [ table : obs ] .",
    "we also list whether or not a silicate emission feature was detected above the continuum for each spectrum , and the strength of that feature , if available .",
    "it is important to note that the 10   continuum in a mid - ir spectrum of a comet is composed of thermal emission from dust species that exhibit little variation in emissivity with wavelength for @xmath13  . the common `` continuum '' contributers are amorphous carbon , fes , and grains large enough to be optically thick to 10   emission @xcite .",
    "thermal emission from the nucleus can also be an important source of continuum flux , and should be removed before measuring the silicate emission ( see  [ sec : nucleus ] ) .",
    "a silicate feature has been detected in 8 of the 13 comets in table  [ table : obs ] , and the typical silicate emission band strength is 1.201.25 .",
    "the silicate emission band strength is computed from the ratio of the mean in - band flux between 10.0 and 11.0   to a scaled planck function that is fit to small sections of the smooth continuum at @xmath14   and @xmath15   and evaluated at 10.5   @xcite . observed silicate band emission strengths in oort cloud comets range from 1.0 to 4.0 @xcite .",
    "such strong silicate band emission has not been observed in a jfc , except in the post-_deep impact _ coma of 9p / tempel ( @xcite ; @xcite ;  [ sec : tempel ] ) .    the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite has significantly increased the number of spectroscopic observations of jfcs in the mid - ir .",
    "three comets with high - quality spectra are listed in table  [ table : obs ] , and 9 more are briefly summarized by @xcite .",
    "this boon to jfc spectroscopy is largely attributable to the high sensitivities of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) instrument @xcite and the high observing efficiency of the _ spitzer _ spacecraft . as future infrared space telescopes will have larger primary mirror diameters , such as the jaxa _ space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ spica _ ) , and the nasa _ james webb space telescope _ , bright comets may become unaccessible to space - borne instrumentation . instead",
    ", ground - based and airborne telescopes will be used to observe the brightest comets .",
    "ground - based observations account for 1/2 of the spectra in table  [ table : obs ] ; about 2/3 of those spectra were taken at the nasa s 3  m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "eight meter telescopes hold great promise for the spectroscopic investigation of jfcs .",
    "the gemini and subaru telescopes have already provided three definitive detections of crystalline silicates in jfcs ; the measured crystalline - to - amorphous sub- mass ratios are : @xmath160.9 for 78p / gehrels ( @xcite ; also discussed in @xcite ) , 0.30.8 for 9p / tempel @xcite , and qualitatively described as less than in hale - bopp for 73p / schwassmann - wachmann @xcite . also ,",
    "gemini - n and subaru observations of the _ deep impact _ event provided , in part , the evidence for the heterogeneous structure and composition of the nucleus of 9p / tempel @xcite . with the continued use of mid - ir instruments on large telescopes , and in conjunction with the archive of space - based observations , we can increase the number of high - quality spectra of jfcs to statistically significant numbers , which will give us the opportunity to establish the extent of crystalline silicate enrichment in jfcs and the degree of jfc nucleus heterogeneity .",
    "future airborne instrumentation on the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) will cover mid - ir wavelengths in spectroscopy mode @xcite . with the telescope executing science operations at altitudes",
    "@xmath17  km , sofia will be an important resource for comet astronomy at 1540  , where atmospheric absorption greatly interferes with observations at ground - based observatories . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the spectral resonances of crystalline silicates are more separated in wavelength , and therefore more distinct , than the resonances near 10  . with 1540   spectra , we can accurately measure the mineralogical makeup of silicate crystals in a comet s coma by measuring the central positions and strengths of the crystalline emission resonances .",
    "in particular , the fe to mg ratio of silicate crystals is better constrained when the longer wavelength peaks are measured .",
    "sofia will add vital observations to the few crystalline measurements made at these wavelengths .",
    "silicate minerals in comets have prominent emission features in the mid - ir .",
    "molecular bonds between si and o atoms have stretching and bending modes that produce emission at 812   and at 1540  , respectively .",

    "cometary silicates are found in both amorphous ( non - stoichiometric ) and crystalline structures .",
    "an example of the narrow thermal emission resonances attributed to silicate crystals , and the broad emission attributed to amorphous grains is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:9p - decomp ] .",
    "comet comae are optically thin to mid - ir radiation . in order to detect the thermal emission from silicate grains in a dust coma",
    ", the grains must be in sufficient quantities to be detected above the observational uncertainty of the smooth thermal continuum @xcite . aside from the amount ,",
    "each grain s size , composition , and structure play important roles in the strength of the silicate emission , primarily by determining the grain equilibrium temperature .",
    "we discuss each of these properties ( size , composition , and structure ) in turn .",
    "first , dust grain size affects the grain temperature . sub-",
    "sized grains have higher temperatures than ( solid ) grains larger than 1   of the same composition .",
    "the temperature difference arises from the dependence of grain emission efficiency on grain size .",
    "all silicate dust grains greater than 0.1   in size are efficient absorbers of sunlight at visible wavelengths ( the peak of the solar output ) , but the sub- sized grains are inefficient emitters in the mid - ir",
    ". since grain radiative cooling at @xmath26  au is dominated by mid - ir radiation , the temperatures of sub- sized grains are warmer , which subsequently increases their total thermal emission flux .",
    "in contrast with grain size , which primarily affects the emission efficiencies of comet grains , composition affects grain absorption efficiencies . increasing the amount of fe in a silicate grain ( decreasing mg ) increases the grain s absorption efficiencies at visible and near - ir wavelengths , which in turn increases the grain s equilibrium temperature @xcite .",
    "the higher temperatures cause fe - rich grains to be easier to detect by spectroscopic means , yet @xcite found the grain temperatures of amorphous silicates in comet hale - bopp were best - modeled with roughly equal amounts of mg and fe ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found the silicate crystals to be distinctly mg - rich ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "these grain parameters have been commonly used by other investigations @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found significant amounts of fe - rich pyroxene in the _ deep impact _ ejecta from comet 9p / tempel ( see  [ sec : tempel ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : silicates - v - wave ] , we summarize the variation of the peak wavelength position with mg content for strong crystalline olivine and ortho - pyroxene peaks observed near 10   from the analyses of @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    finally , grain structure ( i.e. , porosity and shape ) influences the thermal emission from dust . for two otherwise similar grains ,",
    "increased porosity will produce a warmer equilibrium temperature and , in larger grains , a stronger 10   silicate emission feature @xcite .",
    "the effect is due to insulating vacuum inside porous grains , causing sub - domains to be increasingly thermally isolated from each other .",
    "if the porosity of an aggregate grain is more than 63% then the temperature begins to approach that of the monomer ( @xmath160.1   sub - grains ) : at 80% porosity the temperature of the aggregate is only 46% lower than a monomer @xcite .",
    "also , the shape of a porous aggregate determines whether larger porous grains lose or retain their silicate resonant features @xcite .",
    "the net result of increased porosity is a thermal emission spectrum with a hotter temperature and a stronger silicate feature compared to a similar sized compact grain .",
    "thermal emission models for porous aggregates that include crystals ( computed with the discrete dipole approximation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield similar crystalline fractions as the less time - intensive approach of modeling a grain distribution composed of discrete crystals and mono - mineralogic porous grains @xcite .",
    "the above three grain parameters ( size , composition , and structure ) all affect the observed _ strength _ of a coma s silicate emission feature , but each parameter also affects the _ shape _ of the feature . when we consider the silicate emission feature s shape , and the shape of the entire spectrum , we find that there are no one - to - one degeneracies among the dust grain parameters , although there are consistent trends .",
    "for example , the silicate feature strength can be raised by increasing the porosity of grains above @xmath29% vacuum , which yields silicate features and temperatures similar to their monomers @xcite .",
    "increasing the porosity of dust grains in a coma also shifts the spectral slope of the rayleigh - jeans side of the observed spectrum towards the blue ( i.e. , there are fewer , cool grains contributing to the flux at long wavelengths ) .",
    "a small portion of this change in spectral slope can be accounted for by flattening the size distribution to increase the relative number of larger , cooler grains .",
    "the entire effect , however , can not be accounted for in this manner  this is evident when we consider that the largest , highly porous grains have higher equilibrium temperatures than the largest grains with more compact shapes .",
    "oort cloud comet hale - bopp is an example of a comet that displays an extremely strong silicate feature , and that fitting its spectrum requires a size distribution that possesses both highly porous grains and very small grains ( peak grain radius of 0.150.2  ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite discusses how comet hale - bopp s grain porosity and grain size distribution slope are each constrained by spectra . in another example",
    ", oort cloud comet c/2001 q4 ( neat ) has a silicate feature identical in shape to , but weaker in strength than , that of hale - bopp @xcite .",
    "in fact , q4 s silicate feature strength varies on short times scales and is best explained by a variable silicate - to - amorphous carbon mass ratio @xcite .",
    "specifically , decreasing the silicate feature strength by a factor of 1.5 by removing the grains smaller than 0.6   broadens the shape of the silicate feature more than what is observed for q4 .",
    "therefore grain size effects can not explain the observed variations in the spectra of comet q4 .    with the above arguments in mind , we can consider the positive detection of silicate features in many jfcs ( table  [ table : obs ] ) and draw some conclusions .",
    "the weak silicate band emission in jfcs , as compared to some oc comets , could be due to : 1 ) silicates may be less abundant with respect to other dust components ( e.g. , amorphous carbon , fes ) in jfcs than in oc comets ; 2 ) silicate grains may be larger in jfcs than in oc comets ; 3 ) jfc dust may be less porous than oc comet dust ; or 4 ) a combination of 1 , 2 , and/or 3 . out of the few jfcs that have been studied in - detail , there is no clear agreement in the silicate dust content of their comae .",
    "@xcite found jupiter - family comet 2p / encke had a peak grain size distribution of 0.40.5   and a sub- silicate dust mass fraction of @xmath30% ( @xmath31 upper - limit ) .",
    "@xcite reasonably reproduced the silicate feature of 19p / borrelly to within 10% using a 50 - 50 mixture of silicates and carbon .",
    "models of pre-_deep impact _ spectra of 9p / tempel favored a silicate dust distribution with a peak grain size of 0.70.8   for solid to somewhat porous grains @xcite .",
    "it may be that these three comets are truly different in their compositions and grain size distributions , however the models could be refined with new or improved constraints .",
    "for example , the comet encke model fits could benefit from higher sensitivity spectra at @xmath32   that better constrain the grain temperatures and silicate compositions , and all three comet models could be improved with constraints derived from scattered light observations (  [ sec : scattered ] ) .",
    "thermal emission modeling has the potential to constrain grain parameters , but only within the limitations of a given data set .",
    "a few oc comet thermal emission spectra have also been modeled .",
    "models of comets c/2001 q4 ( neat ) , c/2002 v2 ( neat ) , and hale - bopp reveal comae with smaller peak grain sizes ( 0.10.5  ) that are dominated by crystalline silicate grains ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite find that weak silicate emission in several oc comets is correlated with a weak dust scattering continuum and weak 3   thermal emission , altogether suggesting a lack of small grains . from the thermal emission studies it is not clear which of the possible causes ( 1 , 2 , or 3 ) manifest the differences between comet mid - ir spectra , but , from the limited results above , oc comets seem to have an abundance of the smallest grain sizes , when compared with jfcs . in the next section we present recent developments in models of light scattered by comet dust that suggest grain porosity is the dominant property .",
    "models and observations of light scattered by comet dust , in tandem with mid - ir observations , are providing intriguing evidence that supports grain structure as the dominant cause for the difference between jfcs and oc comets . in light scattering models",
    ", grain structure refers to one of three types : solid grains ; compact porous aggregates , described by ballistic particle - cluster aggregation ( bpca ) ; or , fluffy ( highly porous ) aggregates , described by ballistic cluster - cluster aggregation ( bcca ) @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite delineate two types of dust comae : 1 ) comae dominated by compact grains that are either solid , or compact porous ; or 2 ) comae dominated by fluffy aggregates . in scattered light models @xcite , both grain types reasonably reproduce the observed optical properties of comet dust ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but one observable breaks the degeneracy : the relationship between the 10   silicate emission and the structure of the aggregates .",
    "@xcite show that the surface brightness distributions of the dust and gas in comet comae vary from comet - to - comet .",
    "they suggest that gas - rich comets have dust comae that are more spatially compact than their gas comae ( e.g. , comet encke , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dusty comets have dust and gas comae with similar surface brightness distributions .",
    "gas - rich comets have lower optical polarization maxima than dusty comets , and the low optical polarization is correlated with weak or absent 10   silicate features @xcite .",
    "exploiting the correlation between low optical polarization and dust surface brightness distribution , and using recent observations that have shown the low optical polarization is due to gas contamination in broadband filters @xcite , @xcite develop a physical explanation to describe the correlation between dust - to - gas ratios and the 10   silicate emission feature .",
    "their argument is as follows : 1 ) fluffy , porous aggregates have stronger or equivalent 10   silicate emission features compared to compact , or solid , aggregates ( summarized above ) ; 2 ) fluffy aggregates should be more easily accelerated to the gas outflow velocity than compact grains , primarily due to their larger surface areas per mass @xcite ; 3 ) in constrast , compact grains are not accelerated to the gas expansion velocity , and dust comae consisting of compact grains will be more concentrated around the comet nucleus than the gas . altogether , the scattered light and the thermal emission properties of comet dust suggest that grain porosity could be the predominant characteristic that determines the strength of the comet s silicate features .      when assessing the dust content of comet comae , it is important to remove the contribution of the nucleus from the total thermal emission flux .",
    "the nucleus can be a dominant contributor to the mid - ir flux of jfcs , which are typically less active than their oort cloud counterparts @xcite .",
    "a large nucleus flux skews the silicate band strength towards lower values . to illustrate this fact",
    ", we estimate the fraction of the mid - ir flux attributable to the nucleus in a typical jfc observed at @xmath33  au .",
    "we will base our model comet on surveys of jfc dust production rates @xcite and nucleus sizes @xcite .",
    "we will also `` observe '' our model comet at @xmath34  au by appropriately increasing the dust production rate and phase angle to show how the nucleus fraction varies with heliocentric distance .",
    "we then examine table  [ table : obs ] to determine if the weak silicate features are actually a product of large nuclei with low dust production rates .",
    "since visible light observations of comets are more readily available than mid - ir observations , it is advantageous to use the visible observations to estimate the coma brightness of a typical jfc .",
    "the visible light proxy for dust production is the quantity , where @xmath35 is the bond albedo of the dust , @xmath36 is the dust areal filling factor in the field - of - view , and @xmath37 is the projected radius of the field - of - view , typically expressed in units of cm @xcite .",

    "a bright nucleus may affect derived coma parameters , the most immediate of which is the silicate band strength .",
    "it is clear from table  [ table : estimate ] that the nucleus flux can comprise a significant amount of the total flux measured in mid - ir spectra , as high as 8090% , especially when observing comets with low dust production rates ( @xmath67  cm ) using the narrow - slits ( 0.41.0 wide ) on ground - based instrumentation . in this case , if the silicate band strength appears to be between 1.10 and 1.30 , then the nucleus subtracted ( corrected ) silicate band strength would lie between 1.50 and 3.0 ! with a larger slit , the nucleus could be 1030% of the flux . the corrected silicate band strength would then increase to 1.111.43 .",
    "the latter small changes in the silicate band emission of a jfc may not be significant when comparing a jfc to comet hale - bopp , which had a silicate emission feature that ranged from 3.0 to 4.0 , but are important when assessing the properties of jfcs as a whole .",
    "removing the nucleus is relevant to grain thermal emission modeling , even in comets with no discernible silicate emission feature .",
    "comet nuclei have temperature distributions unlike collections of isothermal grains ( the dust coma ) .",
    "comet nuclei have low thermal inertia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore , the sub - solar point on a slowly rotating nucleus will be hottest , and the temperature decreases as the sun - zenith angle ( @xmath68 ) increases ( in the near - earth asteroid model , @xmath69 ) .",
    "in contrast , the thermal propagation timescales in small grains are fast and they quickly equilibrate to a single temperature  a temperature that is cooler than the effective temperatures of comet nuclei .",
    "thus , the shortest wavelengths of a thermal emission spectrum will include the highest fraction of flux from the nucleus ( e.g. , see the reduction of the 2p / encke spectra in * ? ? ?",
    "if the nucleus emission is not removed , a coma modeler would find an increased number of the smallest grains ( the grain sizes that are constrained by the shortest wavelengths ) over a best - fit model that excludes the nucleus flux .",

    "deeper than a few km , heating by @xmath89al is sufficient to crystallize amorphous water ice , but much of the excess heat is quickly dissipated due the the higher heat conductivity of crystalline ice ( about 20 times the heat conductivity of amorphous ice ) . only in comets with radii greater than 10  km can the temperature continue to rise to allow for liquid water to form @xcite .",
    "the interior may be high enough to form phyllosilicates by aqueous alteration of silicate mineral grains in comet dust , but not hot enough to dry out the phyllosilicates to form feo - rich crystalline silicates , as has been suggested to occur in asteroids @xcite .",

    "exactly what conditions led to the formation of crystalline silicates and their transport to the comet forming zone is not known , but the high mg - content of crystalline silicates found in comets requires significant processing of proto - solar nebula amorphous silicates ( see a review by * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , annealing , the process of heating an amorphous grain enough to crystallize it , may have been an important process . based on a wide variety of experiments designed to create amorphous silicates and anneal them into crystals at @xmath161000  k ( see a review by * ? ? ? * ) , mg - rich amorphous silicates anneal to mg - rich crystalline silicates , fe - rich amorphous silicates anneal to fe - rich crystalline silicates , and mg - fe amorphous silicates anneal to fe - bearing crystalline silicates @xcite but the fe - content in the crystals begins low ( 0.1 ) and increases ( to 0.2 ) as the crystallization completes @xcite .",
    "the annealing products and activation energies somewhat depend on how the amorphous silicate starting materials are made in the laboratory ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the major issue with annealing to create cometary crystals is that mg - rich amorphous silicates are not seen in cometary interplanetary dust particles or chondritic materials , so there is no reservoir with which to anneal to mg - rich crystals . instead",
    ", annealing of mg - fe amorphous grains to form mg - rich crystals must occur in a low oxygen fugacity gas ( i.e. , when water is depleted relative to molecular hydrogen ) where fe can be reduced ( removed by interdiffusion ) @xcite .",
    "the small number abundance of fe - rich crystals in cometary materials can be explained either by annealing without fe reduction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or by late - time condensation from the gas phase in a wet nebula ( h@xmath4o / h@xmath4 @xmath821001000 times enhanced over a  dry  nebula ; * ? ? ?",
    "interpretation of _ stardust _ samples of comet 81p / wild , where fe - rich crystalline silicates are found in small numbers @xcite but where secondary aqueous alteration products ( e.g. , layer lattice silicates ) are not found @xcite , the gas phase condensation of moderately fe - enriched to fe - rich silicates is a more consistent scenario than parent body aqueous alteration . moreover , we suggest that the condensation of fe - rich crystalline silicates from a hot , water - rich nebula at times late enough for 90% of the mg to have condensed into solids @xcite may explain the presence of fe - rich crystalline silicates in both comets and in some chondrites that otherwise do not show extensive signs of parent body aqueous alteration .    as discussed above",
    ", fe - rich crystalline silicates can condense from the gas phase when the oxygen fugacity is high . in order to have both mg - rich and fe - rich crystalline condensates",
    ", the water content must be variable .",
    "water variability could come from inward migration of icy planetesimals into the hot inner - zones of the ppd @xcite .",
    "therefore , the differences between the comets with mg - rich crystals and comet 9p / tempel with fe - rich crystals may be a matter of the epoch of each comet s formation , and the efficiency of radial transport in and out of the comet forming zones . studying the abundance of fe - rich crystalline silicates in bodies that have not undergone internal aqueous alteration ( i.e. , comets ) may aid our understanding of the transport of water from beyond the frost line into the inner solar nebula , and the subsequent enrichment of the outer solar system with condensates that formed in a water rich environment .",

    "these observations , including spectroscopy of 9p / tempel during the _ deep impact _ encounter and early _ spitzer _ results , allow us to draw some conclusions on the nature of dust in jfcs : that , 1 ) jfcs have weak silicate emission features , roughly 2025% over the continuum , similar to the lowest values observed in oort cloud comets ; 2 ) the weak silicate emission could be due to low silicate content relative to other grain species ( i.e. , amorphous carbon and fes ) , or due to the preponderance of large , compact grains ( @xmath92  ) ; 3 ) three jfcs show evidence for crystalline silicates in their mid - ir spectra ( four if we include the centaur - like 29p / schwassmann - wachmann)the existence of crystals , also found in oc comet spectra , indicate high temperature processes altered some dust in the proto - planetary disk ; 4 ) jfc nuclei can have heterogeneous dust properties , the evidence for which is presented in studies of the _ deep impact _",

    "we identify several opportunities with which we may improve our understanding of dust in jfcs : 1 ) increase the number of observed jfc mid - ir spectra ; 2 ) continue to model the thermal emission spectra of jfcs in order to ascertain the nature of their weak silicate features ; 3 ) continue to compare models of light scattered by comet dust with thermal emission models to significantly constrain the structure of dust grains ; and 4 ) employ the remarkable capabilities of 810  m class telescopes and sofia to improve our understanding of the amount and mineralogy of silicate crystals in comets , especially their mg and fe contents .",
    "we hope to answer : why do jfcs and some oc comets have weak silicate emission features ?",
