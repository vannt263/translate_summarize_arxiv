    "in particle physics and cosmology , decay of false vacua is an important subject . for example , with the observed higgs and top masses , it has been known that the higgs quartic coupling constant becomes negative above @xmath6gev if the standard model ( sm ) is a good effective theory up to the scale @xcite .",
    "then the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) vacuum is a false vacuum .",
    "even if there exists a true vacuum other than the ewsb vacuum , we may still live in the ewsb vacuum as long as the lifetime of the ewsb vacuum is longer than the present cosmic time . in models beyond the sm",
    ", the ewsb vacuum may still be a false vacuum .",
    "for example , in supersymmetric ( susy ) models , there may exist a color and/or charge breaking ( ccb ) vacuum ( at which some of the superpartners of quarks and/or leptons acquire non - vanishing expectation values ) whose vacuum energy is lower than that of the ewsb vacuum .",
    "existence of such a ccb vacuum imposes important and stringent bounds on susy models @xcite",
    ".    precise calculation of the decay rate of the false vacua is important from both theoretical and phenomenological points of view .",
    "the procedure to calculate the decay rate was formulated in @xcite , in which the decay rate is evaluated by performing the path integral around the saddle - point solution ( i.e. , so - called the `` bounce '' ) of the equation of motion in the euclidean field theory . given the bounce solution , the decay rate per unit volume is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bounce action , which is the euclidean action of the bounce solution , while the prefactor @xmath9 takes account of the effects of fluctuations around the bounce . in many analyses , @xmath8 has been evaluated from the tree - level lagrangian , while an order - of - magnitude estimate has been adopted for @xmath9 .",
    "the main subject of this paper is the calculation of @xmath9 , which is important to determine the overall scale of the decay rate .",
    "another motivation of the calculation comes from the scale independence of the decay rate .",
    "@xmath8 inevitably depends on the renormalization scale @xmath10 at which the tree - level parameters in the lagrangian are defined .",

    "the decay rate of the false vacuum is physical quantity , and therefore , the scale dependence should be cancelled in the expression of @xmath11 .    in this paper , we discuss the calculation of the decay rate of false vacua , paying particular attention to the renormalization - scale dependence of the decay rate @xmath12 . in section [ sec : formalism ] , we summarize the formalism to calculate the prefactor . in sections [ sec : scalar ] and [ sec : mssm ] , we perform numerical calculations of the decay rate @xmath12 for a simple model of a real scalar field and higgs - stau system in the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) , respectively .",
