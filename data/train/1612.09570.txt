    "the interplay between algebraic structures and geometry has been fundamental to the development of mathematics in the recent decades . in particular , it has led to a cornucopia of new results in mathematical physics .",
    "one of examples is the ( refined ) topological vertex function  @xcite which on the geometric side describes gw and dt invariants of toric calabi - yau ( cy ) three - folds , while from the algebraic point of view it is the intertwiner of the ding - iohara - miki ( dim ) algebra . ]",
    "the second famous example comes from the gauge theory : the equivariant cohomology of the instanton moduli spaces ( captured by nakajima quiver varieties  @xcite and the corresponding nekrasov partition functions  @xcite ) is acted on by a certain vertex operator algebra , which turns out to be the @xmath0-algebra of two dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "this correspondence between the geometric ( moduli space ) and algebraic ( @xmath0-algebra ) objects is known as the agt relation  @xcite and has many known implications and generalizations  @xcite .",
    "these two examples are in fact directly related to each other and their relation can be understood on both sides of the algebro - geometric correspondence . on the algebraic side",
    "the equivariant cohomology ( or more precisely @xmath1-theory ) of the instanton moduli spaces is a tensor product of fock representations of the dim algebra  @xcite , while the @xmath2-deformed @xmath0-algebra generators are built from the currents of the dim algebra  @xcite and vertex operators are combinations of topological vertices intertwining the action of the dim algebra and therefore of the @xmath0-algebra  @xcite . on the geometric side",
    "the @xmath3 gauge theory is obtained by compactifying m - theory on the toric cy three - fold .",
    "the parameters of the gauge theory correspond to khler moduli of the cy and the cohomology of the moduli space of instantons is identified with the hilbert space of m2 branes stretching between toric fixed points .    in this paper we explore a particular case of the algebro - geometric correspondence , which is important for topological strings as well as for gauge theories .",
    "we consider refined toric branes wrapping lagnangian submanifolds inside a toric cy three - fold  @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , this setup corresponds to surface operators in gauge theory and to degenerate fields of the @xmath0-algebra  @xcite .",
    "we will consider mostly the algebraic side of the problem and relate the stack of refined branes on the preferred leg of the toric diagram to a particular intertwining operator of dim algebra , which can be recast into a combination of generalized macdonald polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the branes are related to the remarkable _ factorization _ identities for generalized polynomials evaluated on a particular submanifold in the brane moduli space called the _ topological locus .",
    "_    generalized macdonald polynomials  @xcite play the central role in the agt correspondence .",
    "they arise naturally in the study of the dim algebra representations on tensor producs of fock modules . in  @xcite",
    ",  @xcite matrix elements between generalized macdonald polynomials were computed using matrix model techniques .",
    "they turned out to reduce to _ integral factorization identities , _ which provide a very explicit answer for the @xmath2-selberg averages in terms of nekrasov functions .    in this note",
    "we would like to use these integral identities to prove new _ topological locus _",
    "factorization identity recently found in  @xcite .",
    "for special values of parameters the integrals disappear and one is left with macdonald polynomials evaluated at the topological locus .",
    "the integral identity implies that those are still given by the factorized formulas .",
    "this technique allows us to find several new identities for generalized macdonald polynomials on a more general topological locus . in this way",
    "we prove and generalize the results of  @xcite .",
    "we then connect the factorization of the polynomials to the refined topological string picture .",
    "to this end we will interpret matrix model averages as topological string amplitudes on toric cy threefolds with lagrangian branes appropriately placed on the legs of the toric diagram ( for exact correspondence and explanation see  @xcite ) .",
    "factorization of averages relies on the particular properties of the branes residing on the preferred direction of the diagram .",
    "the topological locus corresponds to a certain degenerate limit of the cy , which models addition of a stack toric branes on one of the legs in the preferred direction .",
    "factorization of generalized macdonald polynomials in this picture allows us to understand the amplitudes with toric branes placed on intermediate preferred legs of the toric diagram .",
    "one can also interpret factorization formulas for generalized macdonald polynomials in terms of cft vertex operators in dotsenko - fateev ( df ) representation . in this case",
    "the radical simplification of the formulas occurs due to the particular choice of the dimensions for which the vertex operators do not require any screening currents . in view of the agt relations",
    "this corresponds to a particularly simple surface operator in the corresponding gauge theory .    in the remaining part of the introduction we discuss the main points of this network of correspondences in more detail . in sec .",

    "unrefined topological vertex @xmath11 is cyclically symmetric in the three young diagrams @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , while the refined vertex @xmath14 for general @xmath15 is not .",
    "the recipe above , therefore , includes the choice of ordering of young diagrams in each vertex .",
    "this choice is indicated by the double ticks and the labels @xmath2 and @xmath16 on the corresponding legs in eq .  .",
    "in what follows we will usually omit the indices @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that the choices for the neighbouring vertices should be coordinated , so that the only freedom remaining is the _ global _ choice of the _ preferred direction _ ( horizontal in eq .  ) on the toric diagram .",
    "we omit here the concrete expression for @xmath6 , which can be easily found in the literature , not to overcomplicate our presentation .    to get the final answer for the amplitude one takes the sum over all the young diagrams @xmath4 on the intermediate legs , each taken with weight @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the exponentiated complexified khler parameter of the two - cycle associated to the leg @xmath5 .",

    "the number of branes in the stack sets the maximal possible number of rows in the young diagram @xmath21 .",
    "the final answer for the closed string amplitude does not depend on the choice of the preferred direction , though open string amplitudes do used in the definition of the dim algebra .",
    "the most relevant choices used e.g.  in  @xcite where the `` horizontal '' coproduct @xmath22 and the `` vertical '' ( or perpendicular , or drinfeld ) coproduct @xmath23 . ] .    in the unrefined case",
    "there is also a natural way to put a stack of toric branes on the _ internal _ leg ( and indeed on any lagrangian submanifold of the cy ) .",
    "however , in the refined case only branes on the _ external _ lines have been considered so far . in the present paper we will address this problem and propose a way to put a stack of branes on the intermediate preferred leg . to do this we will employ the duality between open and closed string amplitudes .",
    "open - closed duality in topological strings allows one to model stacks of toric branes by _ closed _ string amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the open string amplitudes should be packed in the ooguri - vafa generating function , and the closed strings propagate in the _ modified background _ containing additional vertical line in the toric diagram .",
    "let us draw the dual pictures in the simplest case of _ one _ toric brane .",
    "the diagram corresponding to the brane can have at most one column , i.e.  it is of the form . another way to obtain our conventions from that of  @xcite",
    "is to exchange the equivariant parameters , @xmath24 . using the terminology of  @xcite this amounts to the exchange of @xmath2-branes and @xmath25-branes . ]",

    "@xmath28 plays the role of the holonomy of the ( abelian ) gauge field living on the toric brane , while on the r.h.s .",
    "it is identified with the khler parameter of the two - cycle obtained by adding an extra vertical line to the geometry . in general , for @xmath29 toric branes the khler parameter in the r.h.s .",
    "will change to @xmath30 .",
    "there are several points requiring clarification in this approach which are absent for ordinary topological string , i.e.  for @xmath31 , and appear only in the refined case :    1 .",
    "the additional vertical line necessarily intersects all the parallel legs coming out of the diagram if there happen to be any ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] b ) for an example ) .",
    "one expects that the amplitude should be insensitive to these intersections since they have nothing to do with the toric brane insertion .",
    "however , in the refined case there is no way to make a `` trivial crossing '' of two lines : no choice of the khler parameter gives the desired result .",
    "one concludes that for several parallel legs the toric brane attached to one of them also interacts with all the others . 2 .",
    "although there is no way to make a `` trivial crossing '' of lines one can make a crossing , which models the trivial one in some situations . for example , this crossing can be used to set the diagram on one side to vanish if the diagram on the other vanishes ( see fig .  [ fig:6 ] b ) , c ) ) .",
    "however , it works only in _",
    "one _ direction : either the left diagram vanishes whenever the right one is empty or vice versa .",
    "because of these features of the refined theory it is unclear how to put a toric brane on the intermediate preferred leg .",
    "the explanation of these puzzles will be the main focus of the present work .",
    "we will show that the amplitudes in the presence of the toric brane on the intermediate leg can be identified with generalized macdonald polynomials evaluated on the _ topological locus .",
    "_      it was shown in  @xcite , that certain refined topological string amplitudes on toric cy three - folds correspond to conformal blocks of the @xmath2-deformed virasoro or @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the horizontal legs of the toric diagram represent the hilbert space of the cft , on which the conformal algebra acts , and the intersections with vertical legs give vertex operators or intertwiners of the algebra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] ) . naturally , the sums over young diagrams living on the _ horizontal _ lines represent the sums over the complete basis of states in the cft hilbert space .",
    "there is a natural choice for such a basis  the basis of generalized macdonald polynomials , which leads to explicit _",
    "matrix elements for the vertex operators given by nekrasov formulas .",
    "the sums over diagrams on the _ vertical _ lines corresponds to the integrals over the positions of the _ screening currents _ appearing in the dotsenko - fateev representation of the conformal blocks .",
    "therefore , vertical lines correspond not simply to vertex operators , but more concretely to the _ screened _ vertex operator insertions  @xcite .",

    "let us first recall the familiar factorization formulas schur and macdonald polynomials .",
    "schur polynomials @xmath36 are symmetric polynomials in the variables @xmath37 , @xmath38 labelled by young diagrams @xmath39 .",
    "they can be understood as characters of finite - dimensional irreducible representations @xmath40 of @xmath41 algebra corresponding to the young diagrams @xmath39 : @xmath42 we usually write all symmetric polynomials as functions of the power sums @xmath43 .",
    "for particular values of the variables lying on the _ topological locus _ @xmath44",
    "schur polynomials are given by very simple _ factorized _ formulas : @xmath45 these expressions can be related to `` quantum dimensions '' , or generating functions of the values of the casimir operators on the corresponding representations .",
    "macdonald polynomials @xmath46 provide a natural generalization of schur polynomials , depending on two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "macdonald polynomials do not have immediate group theory interpretation , but nevertheless have many properties similar to schur polynomials , to which they reduce for @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , they still factorize on the topological locus @xmath47 : @xmath48 notice that the parameters of the topological locus for macdonald polynomials are tied with the deformation parameters , so that for given @xmath16 the locus is one - dimensional .",
    "we will see similar effect in the following sections , where generalized macdonald polynomials will depend on an additional parameter which will enter the definition of the topological locus .      in this section",
    "we give general factorization formulas for generalized macdonald polynomials .",
    "concretely , we have found a generalization of the factorization formula for generalized macdonald polynomials conjectured in  @xcite to a wider topological locus .",
    "the identity reads has already appeared in  @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( 24 ) there ) .",
    "there was a minor typo in  @xcite eq .",
    "( 24 ) : kronecker symbol @xmath49 was missing in the r.h.s . ] :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 the original formula which appeared in  @xcite is given by    @xmath52    it is obtained from eq .   in the limit @xmath53",
    "( one should divide both sides by @xmath54 to get a finite answer ) .    for completeness let us also give the factorization formula where the second argument of the generalized macdonald polynomial is nontrivial :    @xmath55    notice the asymmetry between the two arguments of the generalized macdonald polynomials : while the first factorization formula   has nontrivial dependence on both young diagrams , the second one   actually reduces to the formula   for the ordinary macdonald polynomials .",
    "this peculiar feature can be traced back to the nontrivial choice of coproduct in the dim algebra  @xcite .    from the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:3 ] ) one could have suspected that there is a general two - parametric factorization formula involving both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "however , it turns out that this is not the case , as we explain below .      before presenting more generalizations of the factorization formulas for generalized polynomials",
    "let us give here a short and simple proof for the factorization identities obtained so far . to this end",
    "we will employ the _ integral factorization identities _ discovered in  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "these identities give explicit factorized answers for @xmath2-selberg averages of generalized macdonald polynomials .",
    "the selberg average of a symmetric function @xmath58 is given by the following matrix integral : @xmath59 where the integration measure is @xmath60 and the jackson @xmath2-integral is defined as @xmath61 one example of the factorized identity for the average considered in  @xcite is @xmath62 notice that the parameters of the measure also enter the arguments of the generalized polynomials under the average sign .",
    "let us make a peculiar specialization of eq .   and take @xmath63 .",
    "what does it mean to have _",
    "zero _ number of integrations ?",
    "there is of course no general answer , but for selberg averages the definition we consider seems very natural and can be obtained from analytic continuation in @xmath29 .",
    "the generalized polynomial under the average is written in terms of power sums @xmath43 of integration variables . for @xmath63 power sums",
    "contain zero terms and therefore should vanish .",
    "it is also evident that for @xmath63 there are no integrations neither in the numerator , nor in the denominator in the definition of the average and the integration measure is absent .",
    "thus the l.h.s .  of eq .   reduces to the generalized macdonald polynomial _",
    "evaluated _ at the point @xmath64 , while the r.h.s .  gives the correct factorized answer ,",
    "coinciding with eq .  .",
    "notice that the topological locus parametrized by @xmath65 and @xmath66 in eq .   and by @xmath67 and @xmath56 in eq .",
    "is two - dimensional .",
    "this will always be the case in our considerations since the original integral depends on three parameters , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath29 and we have to put @xmath29 to zero .",
    "more identities can be obtained by using the symmetry of the selberg measure @xmath68 under the change of parameters : @xmath69 since @xmath70 , the average of any function @xmath71 remains the same , @xmath72 of course , if the function @xmath73 itself depends on the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath29 one has to replace them with @xmath74 , @xmath75 or @xmath76 respectively to get the same average . making the change of variables   in eq .   and",
    "setting @xmath77 we get the identity  .    summarizing , the factorization identities for generalized macdonald polynomials  ,   follow from the integral identity   in the limit @xmath63 . in the next section",
    "we will give more factorization identities involving skew generalized macdonald polynomials .",
    "they are proven using a similar argument .",
    "we can also take the specialization @xmath63 in more general integral factorization formulas from  @xcite ( see eqs .",
    "( 93 ) ,  ( 94 ) there ) .",
    "the identities we obtain in this way involve two _ skew _ generalized macdonald polynomials .",
    "skew generalized macdonald polynomials are defined similarly to the usual skew macdonald polynomials : @xmath78 where @xmath79 are ordinary macdonald polynomials . without giving too much technical details let us write down the final results :    @xmath80    where the conjugate generalized polynomial is defined as @xmath81 and the norm of macdonald polynomial is given by an explicit expression @xmath82 the bifundamental nekrasov function is given by @xmath83 there is one more identity similar to eq .  :",
    "@xmath84    identities  ,   are more general than eqs .  ,   and reduce to them in special cases .",
    "for @xmath85 eq .   reduces to eq .   and for @xmath86 it reduces to eq .  .",
    "the situation is reversed , i.e.for @xmath85 it reduces to eq .   and",
    "for @xmath86 it reduces to eq .  .",
    "the new identity   allows one to _ glue _ several factorized expressions together and then use cauchy completeness to obtain a factorized answer for the full sum of factorized terms . as a simplest example we can take the _ trace _ over young diagrams @xmath87 in the identity  . in the language of gauge theory this corresponds to making a circular quiver representing a @xmath88 adjoint theory , while for topological strings this gives the partial compactification of the base of the toric fibration . in each case , to get a meaningful result we have to set spectral parameters of the generalized macdonald polynomials equal to each other . for eq .",

    "the example we have described is of course a trivial one , since each term in the l.h.s .",
