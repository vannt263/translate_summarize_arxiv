    "the [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 planetary nebulae luminosity function ( pnlf ) has been a reliable and precise extragalactic distance indicator for over @xmath3  years @xcite . during this time",
    ", the method has been applied to both elliptical @xcite and spiral @xcite galaxies , to galactic spheroids @xcite and disks @xcite , and even to stars lost within the intergalactic environment of rich clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , pnlf observations are relatively easy : the method requires neither space - based observations nor heroically long integrations , and the photometric procedures needed to derive accurate distances are simple and straightforward . as a result , the pnlf is an integral part of the extragalactic distance ladder , and perhaps the best tool we have for examining systematic differences between population  i and population  ii distance methods ( see figure  [ ladder ] ) .",
    "of course , no technique is perfect .",
    "the pnlf is not well - suited for small galaxies which contain few planetary nebulae , nor can it reach to @xmath4  mpc , where the unperturbed hubble flow dominates . for all practical purposes ,",
    "pnlf observations are limited to @xmath3  mpc ( but see @xcite and @xcite for pn measurements in coma and hydra ! ) .",
    "the technique also requires the use of a narrow - band [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 filter ( fwhm @xmath5   ) , whose properties in the converging beam of a telescope are well known . in this age of fast , extremely wide - field imagers , this can be a severe limitation , especially for systems where the 5007    line is redshifted out of the bandpass of a rest - frame [ o  iii ]  filter .",
    "finally , the pnlf can not easily be calibrated in the milky way ( but see @xcite and @xcite for attempts at a local calibration ) , and we are far away from having a theoretical understanding of the method .",
    "the universe constantly surprises us . for example",
    ", in the 1980 s , if one were to ask whether 4-m telescopes could detect [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 emission from planetary nebulae in the virgo cluster core , the answer would have certainly been no .",
    "the main - sequence turnoff of an elliptical galaxy is @xmath6 , which , through the initial mass - final mass relation , means that the central stars of the pne currently being produced have relatively small masses , i.e. ,  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is well established that cores in this mass range can not be more luminous than @xmath8 @xcite , and that less than @xmath9 of this flux can be reprocessed into the [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 emission line @xcite .",
    "thus , at maximum , the pne inside the elliptical galaxies of virgo should have [ o  iii ]  monochromatic fluxes of @xmath10  ergs  @xmath11  s@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , well below the threshold for night - long observations with a 4-m class telescope .    of course",
    ", one might argue that real galaxies contain a mix of stellar populations and that there will always be some pne produced by higher mass stars .",
    "but this claim poses another problem .",
    "as elegantly pointed out by @xcite , the number of pne produced by any single - aged stellar population is linearly proportional to the luminosity of that population , i.e.,@xmath14 where @xmath15  yr is the lifetime of a pn in its [ o  iii]-bright phase @xcite , @xmath16 is the total integrated ( bolometric ) luminosity of the population in question , and @xmath17 is the population s luminosity specific stellar evolutionary flux .",
    "remarkably , @xmath17 does not depend on age , metallicity , or initial mass function : to within @xmath18 , all populations older than @xmath19  gyr have @xmath20  stars  yr@xmath12  @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "consequently , in order for a virgo elliptical to have a sizeable number of [ o  iii]-bright pne , @xmath18 of its stars must be no older than @xmath19  gyr . such a result has long been ruled out via integrated light spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , even if the pne were detected , there is absolutely no reason to expect the bright end of the pnlf to be a standard candle . from stellar evolution theory , the [ o  iii ]",
    "@xmath0 magnitude of the brightest pne produced by a simple ( single age ) stellar population should change with time , following @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the luminosity of the central star , @xmath24 is the mass of the pn core , @xmath25 is the turnoff mass of the stellar population , and @xmath26 is the age of the population ( measured in gyr ) .",
    "all these derivatives are reasonably well known via our knowledge of main sequence and post - agb stellar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the initial mass - final mass relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nebular physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( the most uncertain term involves the reprocessing of stellar luminosity into line emission at 5007   , but models such as those by @xcite suggest that this derivative is a slowly varying quantity . ) for old stellar systems ( @xmath27  gyr ) , equation  ( [ eq : deriv ] ) implies that the pnlf cutoff should fade by @xmath28  mag per gyr , and over a timescale of @xmath29  gyr , the decline in brightness should be more than @xmath30  mag @xcite . in this age of precision cosmology ,",
    "such a strong dependence would have been certainly been seen .",
    "finally , an examination of planetary nebula morphologies in the milky way reveals that most bright pne are asymmetric , and have position - dependent dust opacities within their circumstellar envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect this dust has on the emergent [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 emission is significant : although each pn is different , the average [ o  iii]-bright planetary nebula is self - extincted by more than 0.6  mag at 5007    @xcite . in fact , as figure  [ mash ] shows , the bright - end cutoff of the pnlf is largely defined by the effects of sight - line dependent circumstellar extinction . at face value , this fact alone would seem to preclude the pnlf from being an effective distance indicator .",
    "@xmath0 to h@xmath31+[n  ii ]  line ratio plotted against [ o  iii ]  absolute magnitude for a complete sample of pne in the lmc @xcite .",
    "the light blue points show the intrinsic line strengths ; the red points illustrate the line intensities that are observed .",
    "the dotted green line displays the observed value of the pnlf cutoff , @xmath32 .",
    "the plot suggests that @xmath32 is largely defined by the action of circumstellar dust . ]",
    "despite these arguments , the pnlf is a precise extragalactic standard candle , capable of generating distances to better than @xmath18 in clusters as far away as virgo and fornax . to demonstrate this ,",
    "one need only look at our local group neighbor , m31 . as illustrated in figure",
    "[ m31 ] , the pnlf of m31 s bulge ( @xmath33  kpc ) has the same bright - end cutoff ( defined via the absolute magnitude @xmath32 ) as that of the system s inner disk ( @xmath34  kpc ) and outer disk / halo ( @xmath35  kpc ) .",
    "given the range of stellar population being observed , this invariance is remarkable .",
    "kpc ) , inner disk ( @xmath36  kpc ) , and outer disk / halo ( @xmath35  kpc ) are vastly different , the derived pnlf distances to each region are consisted to within @xmath37  mag . ]",
    "m31 is not the only place where the pnlf has been tested . pn studies in galaxies as diverse as m33 @xcite , ngc  5128 @xcite , and ngc  4494 @xcite , have been unable to detect any change in @xmath32 with galactocentric radius .",
    "similarly , observations of galaxies in groups and clusters , such as triangulum @xcite , the m81 group @xcite , leo  i @xcite , virgo @xcite , and fornax @xcite ( almost ) always place all the galaxies comfortably within the typical group diameter of @xmath19  mpc .",
    "( the lone exception is in virgo , where the pnlf clearly resolves the m84/m86 system which is known to be infalling into virgo from behind . )",
    "the multitude of internal tests place strong constraints on the types and amplitudes of any systematic errors that might be associated with the technique .",
    "the tests also demonstrate that the pnlf is capable of generating relative extragalactic distances to just a few percent in a variety of galactic environments .",
    "there is no theoretical explanation for the constancy of the pnlf , and reliable distances to galactic planetary nebulae are few and far between @xcite .",
    "hence , the only way to obtain an absolute measurement of @xmath32 and look for external errors in the pnlf method is to survey extragalactic systems that have distances known from other methods .",
    "@xcite did this via pn observations inside 13 galaxies with cepheid distances derived by the _ hst _",
    "key project @xcite . by adopting the `` universal '' pnlf first proposed by @xcite ,",
    "@xmath38 the authors obtained a value of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 flux in ergs  @xmath11  s@xmath12 .    remarkably , despite @xmath3  years of observations , non - parametric statistical tests such as kolmogorov - smirnov and anderson - darling still have not found any reason to reject the shape defined by this simple analytic function ( but see the slitless spectroscopy of @xcite for a curious result in the elliptical galaxy ngc  4697 ) .",
    "of course , this does not mean that other formulations of the pnlf are not possible .",
    "for example , the recent distance determinations to ngc  4697 @xcite , ngc  1344 @xcite , m82 @xcite , ngc  821 @xcite , and ngc  4649 @xcite all use a numerical form of the pnlf derived by combining models of post - agb evolution with empirical constraints on the excitation of [ o  iii]@xmath0 in galactic and magellanic cloud planetaries @xcite .",
    "these measurements are self - consistent within themselves , and usually produce distances that are very similar to those found from equation  ( [ eq : pnlf ] ) . however , because the functions are different , there may be small ( @xmath42  mag ) systematic offsets between the distances derived in this way and those inferred from the purely empirical pnlf .",
    "the quoted uncertainties of the individual distances may also have slightly different meanings .",
    "since 2002 , a few of the pnlf and cepheid measurements have improved , and the number of galaxies studied by both methods has increased to 16 . but",
    "qualitatively , little has changed .",
    "as the left - hand panel of figure  [ comp ] illustrates , all stellar populations more metal - rich than the lmc appear to have the same value for the pnlf cutoff , @xmath43 . in the smaller , metal - poor systems , @xmath32 does fade , in general agreement with the nebular model predictions of @xcite and @xcite . however , since these low - mass systems have few pne and poorly defined pn luminosity functions , this systematic shift in @xmath32 is not an important limitation of the method .",
    "we do note that the best - fit value of @xmath32 can be changed slightly , depending on how one models the response of the cepheid period - luminosity relation to metallicity .",
    "the solid points displayed in the left - hand panel of figure  [ comp ] adopt the cepheid distances of @xcite and assume that the period - luminosity relation for cepheids has no dependence on metallicity .",
    "if we exclude the small , low - metallicity galaxies ( i.e.,objects with @xmath44 ) , these data imply a most likely value for the pnlf cutoff of @xmath45 ( standard deviation of the mean ) , and an external scatter ( @xmath46  mag ) that is fully consistent with the internal errors of the measurements . alternatively ,",
    "if the @xcite period - luminosity data are used with their suggested metallicity dependence ( @xmath47 ) , then the most likely value of @xmath32 brightens to @xmath48 , while the external scatter of the individual @xmath32 measurements increases only marginally to 0.18  mag .",
    "finally , an extreme value of @xmath49 can be obtained if the cepheid distances and metallicities of @xcite are used in the analysis . under this assumption , however , the internal errors of the individual pnlf measurements are no longer consistent with the observed galaxy - to - galaxy scatter , which explodes to almost 0.3  mag .    rather than relying solely on the cepheid period - luminosity relation",
    ", we can take another route to the pnlf zero point by using distances inferred from measurements of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "thanks mostly to _ hst , _ 18 pnlf galaxies of varying hubble types now have reliable distances from this technique @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath32 based on these measurements are shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ comp ] .",
    "if we exclude the results from the two distant systems ( ngc  3368 and 3627 ) where the trgb and cepheid distances are in conflict , the plot looks remarkably similar to that obtained from the cepheids . as before",
    ", there is evidence for a decrease in @xmath32 in low - luminosity , low - metallicity systems .",
    "however , in systems more metal - rich than the lmc , @xmath32 again has a best - fit value of @xmath50 and there is no evidence for a metallicity dependence .",
    "the fact that this number , with its small dispersion , agrees with the calibration derived from cepheids supports the argument that the zero point of the pnlf system is secure at the @xmath51 level .",
    "both the cepheid and trgb methods establish the zero point of the pnlf distance scale to @xmath51 .",
    "we can now use this fact to investigate the calibration of other methods , and search for systematic errors in the distance ladder .",
    "for example , the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method is a popular way of obtaining high - precision distances to galaxies with smooth luminosity profiles , i.e. ,  elliptical and lenticular systems @xcite .",
    "the technique is efficient , well calibrated @xcite , and has a solid theoretical foundation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most direct way of obtaining the zero point of this method is to use the seven cepheid galaxies with bulge populations large enough to be measured with the sbf technique .",
    "if the zero point derived from these galaxies is accurate , then a comparison of pnlf and sbf distances should show good agreement , with a mean near zero , and a scatter that is representative of the internal errors of the methods .    ) and ngc  891 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "ngc  4278 is also an outlier ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the curve represents the expected dispersion of the data .",
    "the figure demonstrates that , although the internal and external errors of the methods agree , the absolute scales defined the two techniques are in conflict . ]",
    "figure  [ sbfhist ] displays the difference in distance moduli for the set of 33 pnlf galaxies with sbf @xmath54-band measurements @xcite .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the systematic offset between the two methods is not zero , nor is it close to zero .",
    "the sbf distance scale is , in the median , @xmath55 larger than pnlf distance scale .",
    "moreover , this property is not restricted to the groundbased @xmath54-band dataset .",
    "twelve pnlf galaxies have high - quality sbf measurements in the @xmath56-band from observations with the _ acs _ on _ hst _ @xcite ; the offset between their pnlf and sbf distance moduli is @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , 16 galaxies have pnlf and sbf @xmath58-band data from _",
    "hst s _ nicmos camera @xcite .",
    "the median offset between these two datasets is @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , there is a problem with the zero point of one ( or both ) of the techniques .",
    "the fact that the offset is due to a zero point error , rather than a systematic trend with stellar population or distance can be shown in two ways .",
    "first , the solid curve in figure  [ sbfhist ] is not a fit to the data : it is instead , the _ expected _ scatter in the measurements , as determined by propagating the uncertainties associated with the individual pnlf and sbf distances and galactic reddening .",
    "the agreement between the curve and data proves that the quoted uncertainties of both methods are reasonable , and that there is little room for additional random errors associated with the measurements .",
    "similarly , if we plot the individual differences in distance moduli against against external parameters such as galactic absolute magnitude , color , distance modulus , or number of bright pne ( within 0.5  mag of @xmath32 ) , we find only one significant trend . as figure  [ sbf_scatter ] illustrates , the offset between the pnlf and sbf correlates slightly with sbf distance modulus , in the sense that distant galaxies have smaller pnlf distances than expected from their fluctuation magnitude .",
    "@xcite interpreted this trend as being due to a systematic error in the pnlf that only effects galaxies with distances greater than 10  mpc . at the time , such an error could plausibly have been due to the existence of foreground intracluster stars in the clusters of virgo and fornax .",
    "however , in the past few years , this explanation has become untenable .",
    "not only is the hypothesis at odds with the information provided by deep virgo cluster surface photometry @xcite , but additional data has shown that the distance discrepancy is not restricted to galaxies in the centers of clusters .",
    "objects such as the isolated elliptical ngc  821 and the x - ray faint elliptical ngc  4697 ( in the virgo southern extension ) , display the same curious offset .",
    "in fact , a closer look at figure  [ sbf_scatter ] shows that the apparent correlation with sbf distance modulus is not driven so much by the measurements of the most distant systems , as it is by the behavior of the relatively nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "if these later - type objects are excluded from the analysis , the correlation with distance disappears .",
    "moreover , except for the systematic offset between the two techniques , the only consistent pattern visible in figure  [ sbf_scatter ] involves the dispersion : the scatter between the pnlf and sbf distance estimates for spiral galaxies is much larger than what is seen for elliptical and lenticular systems .",
    "so where does the offset come from ? as figure  [ comp ] demonstrates , the pnlf zero point is well calibrated by both cepheid and trgb measurements ; while a small increase in the distance scale may be possible , any increment greater than @xmath28  mag is excluded by the data .",
    "likewise , an examination of the sbf zero point calibration shows little room for error ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the median offset for the seven galaxies with both sbf and cepheid distance determinations is @xmath60 if the period - luminosity relation is independent of metal abundance , or @xmath61 if @xmath47 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the uncertainties associated with several of the individual fluctuation magnitudes used in this calibration are large , and a similar analysis with the 12 sbf galaxies with trgb measurements yields an offset of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , while there is some evidence to support a modification in the sbf zero point , any downward adjustment to its distance scale must be slight , @xmath63  mag .",
    "another explanation is therefore needed to reconcile the pnlf - sbf discrepancy .",
    "the answer to this paradox is internal extinction .",
    "to calibrate an extragalactic standard candle , one needs to measure the apparent brightness of the candle , @xmath64 , and adopt values for the distance modulus to the galaxy , @xmath65 , and the intervening extinction , @xmath66 . in other words , @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the derived absolute magnitude of the standard candle in question and @xmath69 is the ratio of total to differential extinction at the wavelength of interest .",
    "( for [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 observations of planetary nebulae , the extinction law of @xcite gives @xmath70 . ) for most methods , including the pnlf , if the reddening to a galaxy is underestimated , then the brightness of the standard candle will be underestimated , and the distance scale implied by the observations will be underestimated .",
    "however , in the case of the sbf technique , there is a non - negligible color term , which causes redder stellar populations to have dimmer fluctuation magnitudes .",
    "consequently , the absolute fluctuation magnitude , @xmath71 , is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the slope of the color dependence .",
    "the zero - point of the sbf distance scale , represented by the constant @xmath74 , is therefore defined through @xmath75 for the @xmath54-band sbf measurements , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , so @xmath79 ( for the _ hst _ @xmath56-band photometry , the coefficient for the reddening term is + 1.71 , while for the ir fluctuation data , the value is + 5.35 . )",
    "so , while the response of sbf measurements to reddening has roughly the same amplitude as that of the pnlf , it has the opposite sign !",
    "even if both analyses were performed perfectly , our imperfect knowledge of foreground extinction would cause the two distance methods to produce different results .",
    "of course , simple random uncertainties in the estimates of foreground reddening , such as those associated with the extinction maps of @xcite , should not produce a systematic error between the two distance scales . however , the calibrators for the sbf and pnlf techniques are mostly mid - type spiral galaxies , while the vast majority of the methods program objects are elliptical and lenticular systems .",
    "this population difference _ can _ create a systematic bias between the two systems .",
    "if the calibrator galaxies have , on average , as little as @xmath80 more internal reddening than the early - type systems that are the methods main targets , the result will be a 0.15  mag offset between the pnlf and sbf distances , in exactly the direction that is observed .",
    "this seems quite plausible , especially since the bulges of most mid - type spirals exhibit more evidence for dust than do the interiors of normal elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , given the extremely strong amplitude of the extinction dependence , it would be surprising if there were nt an offset !    from the above arguments , it seems clear that the offset between the pnlf and sbf distance scales is likely the result of several small effects : a slight ( @xmath42  mag ) underestimate in the brightness of the pnlf cutoff , a slight ( @xmath81  mag ) overestimate in the zero point of the sbf method , and a small shift in both the pnlf and sbf caused by the systematically larger dust content of spiral bulges . without the cross - checking ability of the pnlf , such subtle effects could easily go unnoticed .",
    "over 50 galaxies currently have robust pnlf distance measurements .",
    "these galaxies have hosted @xmath5 known supernovae in the past century , and about half of these objects have well - observed light curves . included in this sample of well - studied supernovae",
    "are 6 sn ii - p , 2 sn",
    "ii - l , 1 sn iib , 1 sn iin , 1 sn ib , 1 sn ic , and 13 sn ia ( see table  [ tab : sn ] ) .",
    "the latter can be used to derive an estimate of @xmath82 .",
    ".sn ia in pnlf galaxies [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sn ]    figure  [ sn_comp ] displays the @xmath83-band maximum magnitude - rate of decline relation for a set of well - observed supernovae in the hubble flow , i.e. ,   in the redshift range @xmath84 @xcite , under the assumption that @xmath85  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 . also plotted are the maximum absolute magnitudes of 13 well - observed local sn  ia , using distances derived from the pnlf .",
    "the agreement between the two sets of data is surprising good , especially when one considers that several of the supernovae are from the era prior to ccd measurements and another is affected by high internal extinction .",
    "this consistency demonstrates the viability of the pnlf as a sn  ia calibrator , and its utility .",
    "over half the local supernovae plotted in the figure occurred in early - type galaxies with no significant population  i component .",
    "cepheids can not be used to measure the distances to these objects . in order to study the brightnesses of sn  ia across galaxy types",
    ", one needs a method such as the pnlf , as it is the most direct way to link measurements within population  i and population  ii stellar systems .",

    "shown as an open circle ) , all the supernovae are from the past 30 years . ]",
    "the greatest impediment to improving the pnlf distance scale is the lack of an adequate theory to explain why the technique is so robust .",
    "the constancy of the pnlf cutoff can not be explained by single - star stellar evolution : the energy emitted by an @xmath32 planetary nebula demands that the pn has a core mass of at least @xmath86 @xcite , and old stellar populations simply can not produce such high - mass objects .",
    "the progenitors of @xmath86 white dwarfs are main - sequence stars with masses @xmath87 @xcite , and stars such as these have very short main sequence lifetimes ( @xmath88  gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "while early - type galaxies may contain a small number of intermediate - age stars @xcite , this population is not nearly large enough to produce the number of pne actually observed .",
    "consequently , in order to explain the pnlf of elliptical galaxies , a more exotic channel of stellar evolution must be considered .",
    "binary evolution is the likely solution to this problem .",
    "there is now considerable evidence to suggest that a significant fraction of pne form via binary star interactions @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite has proposed that an important channel for the creation of an [ o  iii]-bright pn involves conservative mass transfer whilst on the main sequence @xcite , and the subsequent creation of a blue straggler star . though this hypothesis is difficult to test , clues as to its viability",
    "may soon be provided by astrometric and photometric space missions .",
    "@xcite have shown that space - based astrometry of the galactic bulge can provide a census of blue stragglers in a collisionless stellar environment with a well - studied pn population @xcite . by comparing the pn and blue straggler number densities to their expected lifetimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one can test whether the stellar merger hypothesis is self - consistent .",
    "similarly , if blue straggler evolution is an important channel for populating the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function , it must also be a significant contributor to the a - star population of the solar neighborhood .",
    "asteroseismological studies , such as those being performed with the kepler satellite @xcite , may be able to disentangle the two evolutionary scenarios , thereby shedding light on the creation rate of coalesced objects .",
    "another advance that we can look forward to is an improved distance scale to pne in the milky way .",
    "most galactic planetary nebulae have distance estimates based on such dubious methods as the amount of foreground extinction @xcite or the statistical correlation between nebular emission and nebular size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "factor of @xmath89 errors in these estimates are not uncommon , even for bright , well - observed objects , and as a result , obtaining a local calibration of the pnlf cutoff is extremely difficult @xcite .",
    "this will soon change , however , as gaia will expand the number of pne with reliable parallax measurements from @xmath3 @xcite to more than @xmath90 .",
    "this should facilitate dozens of studies of the local pn population , including its [ o  iii ]  luminosity function .",
    "unfortunately , a gaia - based luminosity function , by itself , will probably not enable us to significantly improve the calibration of the pnlf .",
    "as figure  [ mash ] illustrates , @xmath32 is highly dependent on the amount of extinction produced by circumstellar dust , and , despite the extraordinary progress made in understanding the physics of the planetary nebula phenomenon @xcite , this component of the problem has yet to be modeled .",
    "this is major issue , since observations of galactic pne are affected not only by the actions of circumstellar dust , but by foreground extinction as well .",
    "the problem of disentangling the two reddening components may ultimately limit any attempt to calibrate the planetary nebula luminosity function in the milky way .",
    "the pnlf is neither a primary distance indicator nor a method that can reach out of the local supercluster into the hubble flow .",
    "it has no theoretical basis , and next generation missions such as gaia will not substantially improve its calibration . yet",
    "the technique remains an important part of the extragalactic distance ladder : it is , perhaps , the best tool we have for linking the population  i and population  ii distance scales , and identifying systematic offsets between the different methods .",
    "moreover , it is still a relatively efficient technique that does not require space - based observations or extremely long exposure times . since pnlf distances are often produced as a by - product of kinematic studies ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the [ o  iii ]  @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) is an excellent extragalactic standard candle . in theory </S>",
    "<S> , the pnlf method should not work at all , since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae ( pne ) should be highly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> yet the method appears robust , as it consistently produces @xmath1 distances to galaxies of all hubble types , from the earliest ellipticals to the latest - type spirals and irregulars . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore uniquely suited for cross - checking the results of other techniques and finding small offsets between the population  i and population  ii distance ladders . </S>",
    "<S> we review the calibration of the method and show that the zero points provided by cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch are in excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the results of the pnlf with those from surface brightness fluctuation measurements , and show that , although both techniques agree in a relative sense , the latter method yields distances that are @xmath2 larger than those from the pnlf . </S>",
    "<S> we trace this discrepancy back to the calibration galaxies and argue that , due to a small systematic error associated with internal reddening , the true distance scale likely falls between the extremes of the two methods . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate how pnlf measurements in the early - type galaxies that have hosted type  ia supernovae can help calibrate the sn  ia maximum magnitude - rate of decline relation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how the results from space missions such as kepler and gaia can help our understanding of the pnlf phenomenon and improve our knowledge of the physics of local planetary nebulae . </S>"
