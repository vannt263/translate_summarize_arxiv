    "inertial particle dynamics , i.e. the dynamics of small spherical particles immersed in fluid flows , has attracted considerable attention in recent years@xcite .",
    "these studies have two fold importance . from the point of view of fundamental physics ,",
    "the motion is governed by dynamical equations which exhibit rich and complex behaviour . from the point of view of applications , this dynamics constitutes the simplest model for impurities whose transport in flows is of practical interest , in contexts as varied as the behaviour of aerosols or pollutants in air , with consequences for weather and climate , and that of nutrients such as plankton in the sea with consequences for ocean life .",
    "the lagrangian dynamics of such small spherical tracers in two dimensional incompressible fluid flows is described by the maxey - riley equations @xcite .",
    "these are further simplified under various approximations to give a set of minimal equations called the embedding equations where the fluid flow dynamics is embedded in a larger set of equations which include the the differences between the particle and fluid velocities@xcite .",
    "although the lagrangian dynamics of the underlying fluid flow is incompressible , the particle motion is compressible @xcite , and has regions of contraction and expansion .",
    "the density grows in the former giving rise to clusters and falls in the latter giving rise to voids .",
    "the properties of the base flow have important consequences for the transport and mixing of particles .",
    "map analogs of the embedding equations have also been constructed for cases where the fluid dynamics is modelled by area - preserving maps which essentially retain the qualitative features of the flow @xcite .",
    "the embedded dynamics in both cases is dissipative in nature .",
    "further complexity is added to the dynamics by the density difference between the particles and the fluid . in the case of two - dimensional chaotic flows , it has been observed earlier that particles with density higher than the base flow , the aerosols , tend to migrate away from the kam islands , while particles lighter than the fluid , the bubbles , display the opposite tendency @xcite .",
    "neutrally buoyant particles also showed a similar result , wherein the particles settled into the kam islands .",
    "our study indicates that in addition to the density difference , the dissipation parameter of the system also has an important role to play in the dynamic behaviour of the aerosols and the bubbles .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of passive , finite size , inertial particles in underlying two dimensional incompressible flows .",
    "the dynamics is modelled by the four dimensional dissipative embeddings of two dimensional area - preserving maps .",
    "we obtain the phase diagram of the system in the @xmath2 space where @xmath3 is the mass ratio parameter , and @xmath4 is the dissipation parameter .",
    "the phase diagram shows rich structure in the @xmath5 aerosol regime , as well as the @xmath6 bubble regime . unlike the earlier results mentioned above , that the bubbles tended to form structures in the kam islands@xcite and the aerosols were pushed away we found that structures form for both bubbles and aerosols in certain parameter regimes due to the role of the dissipation parameter .",
    "these regimes can be identified from the bifurcation diagram of the four dimensional embedding map .",
    "both the aerosol and bubble regimes in the phase diagram show regions where periodic orbits as well as chaotic structures can be seen in the phase space plots .",
    "in addition to these , fully or partially mixed regimes can also be seen in the both aerosol and bubble cases .",
    "thus the dynamic behaviour of the inertial particles can be of three major types .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams of the embedding map show further interesting structure .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams of the aerosol case show a regime where an attractor - merging and widening crisis can be seen . at the crisis ,",
    "two period-10 attractors merge and widen simultaneously into a single chaotic attractor .",
    "the parameter values at which the crisis occurs , are identified using the lyapunov exponent and the bifurcation diagram .",
    "the signature of the attractor widening crisis can be seen in the intermittency of the time series of the map variables .",
    "the characteristic time before bursts @xmath7 vs @xmath8 follows a power - law , @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the critical value of the dissipation parameter @xmath4 at which the crisis occurs .",
    "thus , the clustering of advected aerosol particles is dependent on the dissipation scale .",
    "however , unlike the case of the aerosols , the bubble region did not show any of the characteristic signatures of crisis , nor was any intermittency seen in the bubble region .",
    "our results can have implications for practical problems such as the dispersion of pollutants by atmospheric flows , and catalytic chemical reactions .",
    "the equation of motion describing the dynamics of passive neutrally buoyant particles of finite size in flows is obtained in @xcite .",
    "this equation is called the bailout embedding equation , and is given by ,    @xmath11 = - ( \\lambda i + { \\bf \\nabla u } ) \\cdot [ \\dot{\\bf x } - { \\bf u}({\\bf x } ) ] .",
    "\\label{neutral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the velocity of the particle @xmath12 and the local fluid velocity @xmath13 match , when the velocity gradient @xmath14 exceeds the dissipation @xmath15 , yielding a positive @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath17 becomes negative , the particle will get detached from the local fluid trajectory and would not follow the fluid .",
    "therefore , the difference between the particle and the sorrounding fluid velocity can exponentially grow or get damped depending on the factor @xmath18 .",
    "the map analog of the flow bailout in eqn .",
    "[ neutral ] is obtained in ref @xcite as ,    @xmath19,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the base map is an area preserving map given by @xmath20 .",
    "this is the bailout embedding map .",
    "we note that , the function @xmath21 in the flow takes the form of @xmath22 in the map case .    for the inertial particle case",
    ", the density of the particle and the fluid do not match .",
    "the dynamics of inertial particles in a fluid flow is described by the equation @xcite , @xmath23    here , the velocity of the fluid parcel is @xmath24 , and that of the particle advected by the fluid flow is @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is the mass ratio parameter @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fluid density and @xmath28 is the particle density .",
    "thus the @xmath29 situation corresponds to aerosols and the @xmath6 situation corresponds to bubbles .",
    "the dissipation parameter @xmath4 is related to @xmath3 by the relation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the stokes number .",
    "the dissipation parameter @xmath4 gives a measure of the expansion or contraction in the phase space of the particle s dynamics .",
    "map analog of the flow described by eq .",
    "[ particle ] has been choosen in ref .",
    "@xcite to be , @xmath32 where the base map is represented by an area preserving map @xmath33 .",
    "this can be rewritten , @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the new variable @xmath35 defines the detachment of the particle from the local fluid parcel .",
    "this is the bailout embedding map .",
    "when the detachment measured by the @xmath35 is nonzero , the particle is said to have bailed out of the fluid trajectory . in the limit @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the fluid dynamics",
    "is recovered .",
    "so the fluid dynamics is embedded in the particle s equation and is recovered under appropriate limit .",
    "this map is dissipative with the phase space contraction rate to be @xmath39 .       +    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note that crisis induced intermittency is seen at several points on the left edge of the periodic tongue in the aerosol regime of the phase diagram .",
    "power law scaling behaviour was seen at all these points . unlike the aerosol case , no intermittency or crisis was observed anywhere in the bubble region .",
    "the reason for this difference in behaviour of the aerosols and the bubbles may lie in the structure of the phase space .",
    "the invariant tori which act as barriers to transport in the neighbourhodd of elliptic fixed points break up at higher values of @xmath40 leaving behind leaky barriers or cantori . in the case of the motion of inertial partcles , the elliptic islands and their neighbourhoods act as centrifuges , by pushing away the heavier aerosols and entrapping the lighter bubbles @xcite . at high values of the dissipation @xmath4",
    ", the dissipation counteracts the effect of the centrifugal force on the aerosols , so that the they are trapped in the neighbourhood of the elliptic islands , despite the centrifugal force that pushes them out .",
    "however , at lower values of dissipation e.g. for our map , at @xmath41 , where @xmath10 is the criticalparameter at which crisis occurs , the centrifugal force pushes out the aerosols through the leaky barries leading to attractor widening and intermittency . in the case of the bubbles , both the dissipation and the centrifugal force work to trap the bubbles , and no crisis or intermittency",
    "is seen .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the standard map which has been studied here is the prototypical area - preserving map .",
    "hence , we expect that the key result , viz . that the dissipation of the fluid as well as the buoyancy of the particles affect the formation of coherent structures and the existence of mixing regions will apply to generic area preserving system",
    ". however , the details of the map , such as the existence of cantori , and the size of the resonance zones will affect details like the existence of phenomena like crisis , crisis induced intermittency etc .",
    "to summarize , the present work discusses the advection of passive scalars of finite size in an incompressible two - dimensional flow for situations where the particle density can differ from that of the fluid .",
    "the motion of the advected particles is represented by an embedding map with the area preserving standard map as the base map .",
    "c    the new embedded standard map is invertible and dissipative and contains three parameters , the nonlinearity @xmath40 , the dissipation parameter @xmath4 and the mass ratio parameter @xmath3 which measures the extent to which the density of the particles differs from that of the fluid .",
    "the phase diagram of the system in the @xmath2 parameter space shows very rich structure .",
    "three types of dynamical behaviours are seen periodic orbits , chaotic structures , and mixed regimes which can be partially or fully mixed .",
    "periodic structures are seen inside tongues in the parameter space in the aerosol as well as bubble regimes .",
    "thus , the clustering or preferential concentration of inertial particles can be seen in both the aerosol and bubble regimes .",
    "chaotic structures can be seen outside the tongues in the aerosol regime .",
    "the bifurcation diagram indicates the existence of crises at parameter values on the edges of the tongues in this regime .",
    "the crisis is of the attractor merging and widening type in which two period ten orbits merge and widen into a chaotic attractor .",
    "crisis induced intermittency is seen in the aerosol regime with charactersitic times @xmath42 which scale as @xmath43 where the exponent @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the critical value at which the crisis occurs . a well mixed regime is also seen for the aerosols . the bubble regime of the phase diagram shows periodic orbits , chaotic structures as well as partially and fully mixed regimes .",
    "no crisis or intermittency is seen here .",
    "the obvious generalisation of our study is to the three dimensional case volume - preserving case . in this case , due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom ,",
    "a much richer phase diagram is expected .",
    "while earlier studies show that regions which target tubular structures in phase space do exist@xcite , the presence of additional stretching directions would perhaps indicate much richer structure and larger mixing regions in phase space .",
    "detailed studies in this direction are in progress .    our results have implications for the preferential concentration of inertial particles in flows , as well as for the targetting of periodic structures .",
    "earlier results indicated that bubbles could breach elliptic islands and target structures , whereas aerosols could not .",
    "our results indicate that the dissipation parameter @xmath4 plays as crucial role in this as the density differential parameter @xmath3 , and the examination of the full phase diagram is necessary to draw conclusions about the parameter regimes where targetting and breaching can occur .",
    "we also see that mixing regimes can also exist , where random initial conditions can spread throughout the phase space .",
    "these results can have implications for the dynamics of impurities in diverse application contexts , e.g. that of the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere , flows with suspended microstructures , coagulation of material particles in flows and catalytic chemical reactions .",
    "we hope the present work will prove to be useful in some of these contexts .",
