    "in general , the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath5 , expressed by a @xmath6 antisymmetric matrix , is used to describe the electromagnetic field intensity .",
    "this tensor provides a convenient expression for the lorentz force and therefore is used to describe the motion of charged particles in this field .",
    "another way to describe an electromagnetic field is by use of the 4-potential . in a chosen gauge ,",
    "the 4-potential transforms as a 4-vector .",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor is defined as the derivative of the 4-potential .    in 1904",
    "e. t. whittaker introduced @xcite two scalar potential functions .",
    "he showed that the electromagnetic field can be expressed in terms of the second derivatives of these functions .",
    "h. s. ruse improved @xcite the result of whittaker and showed that these two functions transform as invariants .",
    "we show that it is possible to combine these two scalar potential functions into one complex - valued function @xmath0 on complexified minkowski space , which we call the _ scalar complex potential of the electromagnetic field_.    complexified space - time was also used by barut @xcite for introducing a classical theory of fields and particles . in @xcite",
    "this space was used for different representations of the poincar group on relativistic phase space and in @xcite and @xcite for the description of the motion of a charge in an electromagnetic field .",
    "it turns out to be easer to express and calculate the scalar complex potential of the electromagnetic field by the use of a bondi tetrad for complexified minkowski space .",
    "such a basis is used widely , see for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the connection of the relativistic phase space to the bondi tetrad is described in @xcite .",
    "we use the complex faraday tensor @xmath7 , which was introduced in @xcite and used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the real part of this tensor coincides with the usual electromagnetic tensor of the field .",
    "the additional symmetries of this tensor make it attractive to solve evolution equations and to obtain new representations of the lorentz group .",
    "an electromagnetic field is generated by a collection of moving charges .",
    "thus , a description of an electromagnetic field can be obtained by integrating the fields of moving charges .",
    "we show that for a moving charge and observer point in space - time , there is a complex dimension - less scalar which is invariant under some representation of the lorentz group .",
    "the scalar complex potential @xmath0 is defined to be the logarithm of this scalar .",
    "we show that the faraday tensor @xmath7 is an appropriately defined second order derivative of the scalar complex potential .    in classical mechanics ,",
    "the negative of the gradient of a scalar potential equals the force .",
    "this is true for forces which generate linear acceleration .",
    "such forces are defined by a one - form ( since their line integral gives the work ) .",
    "the derivative of a scalar function is also a one - form .",
    "hence , the derivative of a potential could be equal to the negative of the force .",
    "but in classical mechanics we also have rotating forces , which are described by two - forms .",
    "such forces can not be expressed as derivatives of a scalar potential . in special relativity , the electromagnetic field",
    "is expressed by a two - form .",
    "so , it is natural to assume that a kind of second derivative of a scalar potential will define the force .",
    "note that the usual differential form derivative of a gradient is zero .",
    "therefore , we define a lorentz invariant conjugation on the complex space - time .",
    "we show that the derivative of the conjugate of the gradient of the complex potential equals the faraday tensor @xmath7 of the field .",
    "in section 2 we recall the definition of the bondi tetrad on the complexified minkowski space @xmath1 and the transformation from the usual basis to it . in section 3",
    "we introduce a complex faraday tensor and define the complex analog of the @xmath8 operator on @xmath1 . in section 4 we show that this tensor is decomposable if we use bondi tetrad for @xmath1 .",
    "the faraday tensor is used in section 5 to define two lorentz group representations on the complexified space - time . for each representation",
    "we define a conjugation on @xmath1 which is invariant under it . in section 6",
    "we introduce an invariant scale - free scalar associated with a null - vector .",
    "the logarithm of this scalar becomes the scalar complex potential of a moving charge .",
    "this potential is introduced in section 7 . in section 8",
    "we calculate the 4-potential of a moving charge as the conjugate of the gradient of the complex potential . in section 9",
    "we derive the faraday tensor @xmath7 of the field of a moving charge as the derivative of the 4-potential .",
    "we give an explicit formula for such a field . in section 10",
    "we show how to extend the scalar complex potential to arbitrary electromagnetic field .",
    "we show that it satisfies the wave equation and obtain an explicit form of the complex @xmath8 operator under this representation .",
    "let @xmath9 be an inertial reference frame with basis @xmath10 , for @xmath11 and coordinates @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the speed of light . for the rest of the paper we will use units",
    "in which @xmath14 and thus we will omit @xmath13 from equations .",
    "greek indices range over @xmath15 and latin indices over @xmath16 .",
    "the inner product of two 4-vectors is defined , as usual , as @xmath17 the space of 4-vectors with this inner product is minkowski space - time .",
    "we now complexify minkowski space - time by allowing the coefficients @xmath18 to be complex numbers . as a space",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath19 .",
    "we extend the inner product ( [ inner prod mink ] ) to a symmetric complex bilinear form .",
    "we will call such a space with such a bilinear form on it the _ complexified minkowski space _ and denote it by @xmath1 .",
    "one possible interpretation of @xmath1 is the following : consider the state space of a zero spin particle which is described by a complex - valued function @xmath20 on the space - time .",
    "the gradient operator , describing a generalized momentum , maps the space - time into @xmath1 since @xmath21 and the inner product ( [ inner prod mink ] ) on @xmath1 is induced from the inner product on space - time .",
    "another possible interpretation of @xmath1 is : an electromagnetic field is described by a two - tensor @xmath22 defining the action of the field on the 4-velocity @xmath23 of a test charge @xmath24 , expressed by equation @xmath25 .",
    "the 4-velocity can be considered as a tangent vector to the path of the charge in minkowski space - time .",
    "a typical charge is a collection of electrons .",
    "so , we can think of a test charge as a single electron . but",
    "a state of an electron describing its evolution depends also on the spin @xmath26 of the electron , as can be seen from the stern - gerlach experiment .",
    "the evolution of the spin in the field is given by the bmt equation which , if we assume that the land@xmath27 factor of the electron to be equal 2 , is @xmath28 .",
    "note that the spin evolution is the same as the evolution of the 4-velocity . by complexifying the tangent space of minkowski space - time",
    ", we can define a complex 4-vector @xmath29 that will describe the state of the electron and the space @xmath1 containing all such state vectors . with this notation",
    "the evolution equation will become @xmath30 .",
    "note that since @xmath26 is a pseudo - vector and @xmath31 is a vector , in order that @xmath32 will be well defined @xmath33 must be a pseudo - scalar which changes its sign with the change of orientation in space .",
    "for other possible interpretations of @xmath1 , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ bondi null tetrad _ ( _ bt _ , in short ) , called also newman - penrose basis , on @xmath1 is defined by @xmath34 @xmath35 for the significance of the bt see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . note that application of complex conjugation on @xmath1 , which is equivalent to replacing @xmath33 with @xmath36 , maps the bt into itself , but exchanges @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "this mean that also here @xmath33 is a pseudo - scalar which with the change of orientation , that may be expressed by change of the order of the basis vectors , changes its sign .",
    "we will denote by @xmath39 the coordinates of a vector in @xmath1 with respect to the bt , meaning @xmath40 then , the relation between the coordinates is @xmath41 or inversely , @xmath42    the coordinate transformation could be expressed by the transfer matrix @xmath43 given by @xmath44 thus , @xmath45    the metric tensor @xmath46 in the bt is given by @xmath47 the bilinear symmetric scalar product of two 4-vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 this , for example , implies that @xmath51 in case @xmath52 , the last identities need to be reversed @xmath53 in these coordinates , the lowering of indices is denoted by @xmath54 . for example , @xmath55",
    "an electromagnetic field can be defined by an electric field intensity @xmath56 and a magnetic field intensity @xmath57 .",
    "equivalently , one can define a complex 3d - vector , called the faraday vector , as @xmath58 in order to represent the electromagnetic field .",
    "note that since @xmath33 is a pseudo - scalar and @xmath59 is a pseudo - vector , the expression @xmath60 is a vector which is independent of the chosen orientation of the space .",
    "the faraday vector is used to describe the lorentz invariant field constants .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to describe an electromagnetic field is by use of the 4-potential @xmath61 .",
    "it is known that the 4-potential @xmath61 and the @xmath62 components of the electric and the magnetic field intensities @xmath63 are connected by @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the antisymmetric 3d levi - civita tensor , with @xmath66 . from this",
    "we get that the components of the faraday vector satisfy @xmath67    we introduce matrices @xmath68 and differential operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 . with this notation",
    "we can rewrite equation ( [ 4-potent andf ] ) as @xmath71    in @xcite we introduce a _ complex faraday tensor _ for the description of an electromagnetic field .",

    "we will denote by @xmath76 the matrix of @xmath7 in this representation . by the usual formula of basis transformation",
    "we get @xmath77 this show that the faraday tensor become decomposable in bt .",
    "thus it can be simplified if we introduce the following tensor decomposition .",
    "the tensor decomposition of a @xmath6 matrix as a tensor product of @xmath78 matrices is defined by use of the binary representation of numbers .",
    "each of our indices @xmath79 can be considered as a pair of indices @xmath80 with value in @xmath81 by @xmath82 the _ tensor decomposition _ of a two tensor @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 for example , the tensor @xmath85 can be decomposed as @xmath86    the following properties of the tensor decomposition can be verified directly from the definition : @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 are @xmath78 matrices and @xmath90 is a constant .    with this notation and the properties of the tensor decomposition , we can rewrite ( [ fnp0 ] ) as @xmath91 where @xmath92 denote the usual pauli matrices , and",
    "@xmath93 is the @xmath78 identity matrix .",

    "such operators may be considered as elements of the action of lie algebra of the lorentz group on @xmath1 .",
    "an electric field , which is connected to acceleration , can be considered as the generator of a boost , and a magnetic field can be considered as the generator of a rotation .",

    "<S> in this paper , we define a scalar complex potential @xmath0 for an arbitrary electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this potential is a modification of the two scalar potential functions introduced by e. t. whittaker . by use of a complexified minkowski space @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we decompose the usual lorentz group representation on @xmath1 into a product of two commuting new representations . </S>",
    "<S> these representations are based on the complex faraday tensor . for a moving charge and for any observer </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a complex dimensionless scalar which is invariant under one of our new representations . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar complex potential is the logarithm of this dimensionless scalar times the charge value . </S>",
    "<S> we define a conjugation on @xmath1 which is invariant under our representation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the faraday tensor is the derivative of the conjugate of the gradient of the complex potential . </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the faraday tensor coincides with the usual electromagnetic tensor of the field .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath0 , as a complex - valued function on space - time , is described as an integral over the distribution of the charges generating the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this potential is like a wave function description of the field . </S>",
    "<S> if we chose the bondi tetrad ( called also newman - penrose basis ) as a basis on @xmath1 , the components of the faraday vector at each point may be derived from @xmath0 by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the known @xmath4-matrices of dirac . </S>",
