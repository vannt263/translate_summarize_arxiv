    "it has long been known that tidal filaments have blue optical colors , with regions as blue or bluer than the spiral arms of disk galaxies ( zwicky 1956 ; arp 1966 ; schweizer 1978 ; schombert , wallin , & struck - marcell 1990 ; weilbacher et al .",
    "2000 ) . what is not known is whether the blue colors of the tails reflect the fact that they are comprised of formerly star - forming disk material that was ejected from the host spirals several @xmath3 yrs ago , or if they reflect on - going and pervasive tidal star - formation .",
    "localized regions of current tidal star formation have been unambiguously identified via the optical emission lines of the regions ionized by young ( @xmath410 myr ) stars ( e.g. stockton 1974a , b ; schweizer 1978 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ; iglesias - p ' aramo & v ' ilchez 2001 ; weilbacher , duc , & fritze-v.alvensleben 2003 ) . and recently individual young stars ( saviane , hibbard & rich 2004 ) and star clusters ( knierman et al . 2003 ; tran et al .",
    "2003 ; de grijs et al .",
    "2003 ) have been discovered within tidal tails .",
    "but in general these studies are only sensitive to the youngest objects or only target small regions of the tails .",
    "it is thus not clear how prevalent star formation within the tails is , or if star / cluster formation only occurs at specific sites or at a specific evolutionary stage of tidal development .    at a newly revised trgb distance of 13.8 mpc ( saviane et al .",
    "2004 ; used throughout ) , the antennae is the nearest on - going major merger , and an excellent target for studying tidal star formation .",
    "many studies have concentrated on the spectacular inner regions of this system ( e.g. zhang , fall & whitmore 2001 ; kassin et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , we defer a discussion of those regions to a future paper . here",
    "we concentrate on the tidal regions .",
    "we are particularly interested in whether there are widespread stellar populations with ages less than the dynamical time of the tidal tails , which is @xmath5300 myr as derived either from the maximum tidal extent divided by the maximum tidal velocity ( 45 kpc/150 km s@xmath6 ) or the numerical model of barnes ( 1988 ; 320 myr when scaled to the distance of saviane et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "schweizer ( 1978 ) discovered several regions near the end of the southern tail of ngc 4038 .",
    "both he and mirabel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) studied this region and suggested two possible sites of forming or formed `` tidal dwarf galaxies '' ( tdgs ) : dwarf galaxy - sized self - gravitating objects assembled from tidal debris ( e.g. duc & mirabel 1999 ) . in the following , we refer to these regions as tdg[s78 ] and tdg[mdl92 ] , and indicate their locations in figure 1 ( see also hibbard et al .",
    "the stellar population of the tdg[mdl92 ] region was studied with the hst wfpc2 by saviane et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find a population of eight young stellar associations ( ages less than 30 myr ) , as well as a more extended population of intermediate age ( 80100 myr ) bright red stars .",
    "knierman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the hst wfpc2 to target a region midway along the southern tail , finding no significant population of bright ( @xmath7 ) star clusters .",
    "ngc 4038/39 was targeted as part of the galex _ nearby galaxies survey _ ( bianchi et al .",
    "when combined with existing ground - based optical colors , the @xmath2 colors provide an adequate color baseline to discriminate between stellar populations with ages ranging from 101000 myr , spanning the dynamical age of the tails and allowing us to identify populations formed both before and after the tails were ejected . and",
    "while the detailed hst observations mentioned above studied the youngest stellar populations at two small regions within the southern tail , the sensitivity and wide field of view of the new galex observations provides a complete census of on - going and recent star formation along the entire tidal system , including the previously unstudied northern tail .",

    "the antennae was observed by galex ( martin et al .",
    "2004 ) on 2004 - 02 - 22 in four orbits with the total exposure time of 2554 seconds .",
    "the data reduction was done using the standard galex pipeline ( morrissey et al .",
    "the r.m.s noise in the pipeline data is 27.83 ab mag arcsec@xmath15 in the @xmath0 ( 1550 ) image and 28.02 ab mag arcsec@xmath15 in the @xmath1 ( 2310 ) image .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath0 image is @xmath16 , and that of the @xmath1 image is @xmath17 .",
    "we combine the galex observations with the optical and observations of hibbard et al .",

    "the @xmath2 data were first edited to remove stars and then convolved to the resolution of the intermediate resolution data ( fwhm=@xmath18 ) .",

    "the resulting images reach limits of @xmath2129.5 mag arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "figure 1 presents a montage comparing the @xmath0 and @xmath1 morphology to the optical and data of hibbard et al .",
    "the full - resolution @xmath2 data is shown in fig.1a , while the smoothed data are shown in fig.1b , c .",
    "figure 2 shows the full resolution @xmath2 data of the inner disks and the end of the southern tail , with column density contours superimposed .",
    "table1 lists global @xmath2 and optical magnitudes and colors of the different regions outlined in fig.1f .",
    "the smoothed @xmath2 emission is quite extended and structured , especially compared to the smoothed optical image ( fig.1e ) .",
    "remarkably , the map appears similarly structured ( fig.1f ) .",
    "in fact , there is a close correspondence between column density peaks and @xmath2 emission .",
    "most notable is the correspondence in the vicinity of the tidal dwarf candidates labeled in fig.1a , and the region immediate to the east of these regions ( fig.2b ) . from the vla channel maps , hibbard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) noticed that the southern tail has a bifurcated structure , with two parallel gaseous filaments joining up at the location of the star forming regions associated with tdg[mdl92 ] .",
    "one filament coincides with the brighter optical spine of the tail , while another runs along the southern edge with little or no apparent optical counterpart ( @xmath22 mag arcsec@xmath15 ) .",
    "the galex observations show a very similar bifurcated morphology which matches up well with the higher column density contours .",
    "ngc 4038/39 is yet another example of a seemingly general galex result that bright @xmath2 regions often correspond to column density peaks ( e.g. , neff et al .",
    "2004 ; thilker et al . 2004",
    "; xu et al . 2004 ) .",
    "luminosity - weighted average ages for the stellar populations of the features delineated in fig.1f were estimated by comparing the observed @xmath23 and @xmath24 colors with synthetic colors computed from reddened bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , as described by bianchi et al .",
    "( 2004b ) . the foreground extinction value from the ned database , e(b - v)=0.046 , was adopted as a lower limit . in view of the associated gas ,",
    "the intrinsic colors are likely bluer ( especially for the disk and tdg regions ) , which would lower all the ages listed in table1 .",
    "the population ages were derived from models of single burst star formation ( ssp ) . in the case of composite population ,",
    "these ages give an indication of the age of the most recent burst , which dominates the @xmath2 fluxes .",
    "we also compared the observed colors with models of continuous star formation ( csp ) .",
    "most regions are much redder than any csp model , thus excluding this scenario .",
    "more extended model comparisons considering a variety of star formation scenarios are deferred to a subsequent paper .",
    "table1 suggests a slightly older characteristic population for the north tail compared to the south tail .",
    "this difference is likely related to the very different gas contents of the two tails ( fig.1f ) .",
    "the age estimates lie close to the expected dynamical age of the tail of @xmath5300 myr (  1 ) .",
    "so , in the absence of internal reddening , the global tail ages are consistent with little or no star formation subsequent to tidal ejection , with the exception of the tdg regions ( known to harbor star forming regions ) .",
    "to get a better idea of whether star formation has proceeded in regions apart from the tdgs since the tails were ejected , we conducted photometry on other @xmath2-bright complexes along the tails .",
    "the resulting color - coded ages are shown graphically in fig.2c .",
    "again we have assumed the minimum foreground reddening . in this figure , only regions with red or magenta colors have population ages as old or older than the dynamical age of the tails .",
    "most of the @xmath2-bright regions have populations which are significantly younger .",
    "this figure suggests that , while the general stellar population of the tails is of order its dynamical age , there are a number of locations _ besides the tdg regions _ which have formed stars subsequent to the ejection of the tails .",
    "fig.2c thus provides a valuable finding chart for future pointed observations in order to study extra - disk star formation .",
    "we conclude that there has been some low - level _ in situ _ star formation within the tidal tails , mostly associated with the brighter @xmath2 regions and local gas density peaks .",
    "fig.2c further shows an indication of an age gradient , from @xmath25 300 myrs to less than 100 myrs , when moving outward along both tails .",
    "this gradient is hinted at by the @xmath23 color map ( fig.1d ) and the @xmath26 color map of hibbard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , both of which become bluer with distance . for the two brightest clumps in the ` tdg ' region , somewhat discrepant",
    "ages are obtained from the @xmath23 and @xmath24 colors , suggesting a composite population .",
    "this is consistent with the results of saviane et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find an extended population of intermediate age ( 80100 myr ) bright red stars in addition to the young stars and stellar associations in the tdg region ( ages @xmath27 myr ) .",
    "the presence of similar mixed populations of young , intermediate age , and older stars was inferred from galex measurements of tidal tails in other interacting galaxies ( neff et al .",
    "2004 ) .    finally , the inner regions of the progenitor disks are shown in fig.2a . while these regions will be the subject of a future paper , we note here several features brought out in the smoothed @xmath2 data :",
    "the first is that the @xmath0 flux is sharply truncated in the southwestern part of the disk of ngc 4038 ( see arrow in fig.1b ) , a similar sharp edge is seen in the disk ( fig.2a ) .",
    "the @xmath2 color of this region is significantly redder than the rest of the disk ( @xmath280.9 mag , compared to 0.3 mag ) .",
    "imaging of this region at a variety of wavelengths ( e.g. zhang , fall & whitmore 2001 ) suggest that this is not due to dust , and the optical - nir imaging of kassin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that the stellar population of this region is uniformly very old .",
    "this region is associated with the giant loops of hot thermal plasma ( @xmath29 kev ) imaged by chandra ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) , raising the possibility that an x - ray wind swept this region clear of cold gas in the recent past , truncating star formation . on a larger scale , there is a halo of faint @xmath2 emission surrounding both disks ( fig.1b , c ) .",
    "this emission is unlike that in the tails in that it is more extended in the @xmath0 than the @xmath1 ( note the blue colors in fig.1d ) .",
    "it is uncertain whether there is faint optical counterpart to this emission , since the optical ccd imaging did not extend this far .",
    "if there is no optical counterpart , then the emission may be associated with shocked gas in the recently discovered x - ray halo ( fabbiano et al .",
    "we have studied the @xmath2 light within the archetypal merger ngc 4038/39 , `` the antennae '' .",
    "the tidal @xmath2 morphology is remarkably similar to the tidal , with a close correspondence between regions of bright @xmath2 emission and high column density .",
    "there are interesting features in the @xmath2 morphology of the inner regions .",
    "the @xmath0 light in the southwestern half of the disk of ngc 4039 is sharply truncated , coincident with a similar truncation in the disk .",
    "this gas may have been removed by the x - ray loops recently imaged in this system by chandra ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) , inhibiting subsequent star formation . on a larger scale , there is a @xmath0 `` halo '' , possibly related to shocked gas in the x - ray halo .    while it has long been known that tails are generally blue (  1 ) , the galex observation provide color baselines to determine how much of the @xmath2 radiation comes from stars younger than the dynamical age of the tails .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggests that most of the stars within the tidal tails date to before the tail formation period .",
    "the population in the northern tail appears older than that in the southern tail .",
    "examining individual @xmath2-bright regions within the tails we find regions of more recent star formation , which occur at regions of higher column density , and extend well beyond the previously identified tail star forming regions .",
    "the tails are thus a promising laboratory for studying extra - disk star formation and testing theories of star and cluster formation .",
    "the present results are for a very simplistic star formation history .",
    "a future analysis will include more complicated star formation histories , and will incorporate all available @xmath2-to - optical colors of the tails .",
    "the @xmath2 color baselines should enable us to not only identify current star forming regions , but to examine and date regions of past star formation . by comparing the number of regions of a given age and the star formation history in individual knots",
    ", we will be able to test whether long lived condensations form within tidal tails .",
