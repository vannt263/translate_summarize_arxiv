    "the ground state of the ising hamiltonian @xmath0 at critical magnetic field strength , @xmath44 , is represented using a scale - invariant mera obtained in these two ways .",

    "a scale - invariant mera is then built from tensors ( disentanglers and isometries ) produced while implementing tnr , as described in the main text . here",

    "[ fig : energycompare ] . for an equivalent bond dimension @xmath122 , energy minimization produces a mera with smaller error @xmath129 than tnr , by a factor @xmath130 that is roughly independent of @xmath122 . that energy minimization would produce a more accurate estimate of the ground state energy than tnr was to be expected , for two reasons .",
    "first , the energy minimization algorithm directly targets the ground energy as its figure of merits , whereas tnr does not .",
    "second , the energy minimization algorithm optimizes the mera by sweeping back and forth over length scales / layers many times , whereas tnr considers each length scale only once , without returning back to optimize shorter length scales after coarse - graining larger length scales .",
    "however the cost of optimization also differs between the approaches : the leading order cost of energy minimization scales as @xmath124 , whereas the cost of tnr scales as @xmath123 .",
    "there is also a significant difference in the number of optimization steps required to reach a converged result .",
    "the energy minimization algorithm requires many more steps to converge , as the algorithm sweeps over scales thousands of times , compared to tnr , which treats each scale only once .",
    "the difference between the two approaches in terms of the number of optimization steps required is difficult to quantify as it depends on many factors , but here we find that energy minimization requires roughly an order of magnitude more steps than tnr .",
    "[ fig : energycompare](b ) compares the energy error @xmath129 between energy minimization and tnr as a function of the leading order computational costs of the approaches . even though this comparison does not take into account the difference in the number of optimization steps between the approaches , tnr is already seen to be more computationally efficient in producing a mera approximation to the ground state within some specified accuracy @xmath129 than the energy minimization algorithm .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that when tnr is applied to a tensor network representing the euclidean path integral of a quantum hamiltonian @xmath0 ( restricted to the upper - half plane ) , it generates a mera approximation for the ground state of @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we show an analogous result for trg : we show that when applied to the same tensor network , it generates instead a tree tensor network ( ttn ) approximation for the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "this result , which extends to several generalizations of trg , offers an alternative perspective to understand the qualitative differences between trg and tnr , and provides a robust theoretical argument for why trg can not realize a critical fixed - point tensor while tnr can @xcite .",
    "indeed , the failure of trg to produce a critical fixed - point tensor can be understood to follow from the well - known fact that the ttn ansatz ( with fixed bond dimension ) can not reproduce the logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy , @xmath131 , found in the ground states of @xmath125 quantum systems at a critical point .    for simplicity",
    ", we will derive this result not for the original trg , but for an improved version known as _ higher order tensor renormalization group _ ( hotrg ) , which was proposed in ref.@xcite .",

    "a significant improvement in renormalization schemes for tensor networks has been the use of the so - called environment to achieve a more accurate truncation . the second renormalization group ( srg ) proposed in ref.@xcite uses to knowledge from the environment , obtained approximately by iteratively sweeping over all length scales , to allow the tensor truncations to be performed so as to minimize the _ global _ error , as opposed to the _ local _ error minimized in trg and hotrg . ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a version of srg based upon hosvd , called the hosrg , which we will now consider .",
    "the use of the environment allows hosrg to more accurately discern which degrees of freedom can be truncated , and which should be retained , at each rg step .",
    "this allows for a smarter choice of isometries .",
    "however , hosrg is structurally still based upon the same blocking scheme as hotrg , fig.[fig : hosvd](e ) .",
    "it follows that hosrg also leads to a ttn representation of ground and excited states as depicted in fig.[fig : ttn ] .",
    "the only difference being that the isometries @xmath108 that compose the ttn have been better chosen with hosrg than with hotrg , as they minimize the global error .",
    "in particular , for the same bond dimension @xmath122 , hosrg may produce a more accurate ttn approximation to the ground state than hotrg .",
    "however , as it happens with hotrg ( and trg ) , hosrg can not generate a proper rg flow in the space of tensors  that is , one that at criticality flows to a critical fixed - point tensor .",
    "indeed , hosrg produces a ttn , which is known to only be able to accurately describe a critical system if the bond dimension grows with increasing scale . but",
    "a bond dimension that grows with scale is incompatible with having a fixed - point tensor ."

    "<S> we have argued that , instead , an approximate mera representation of the ground state @xmath19 can be obtained with tnr by coarse - graining an initial , quasi - exact tensor network representation of @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this only requires one sweep over scale , and it is therefore computationally much more efficient @xcite . in addition , at each coarse - graining step tnr introduces a truncation error @xcite that can be explicitly computed . </S>",
    "<S> if this truncation error is sufficiently small , then one can certify that the resulting mera approximates the true ground state @xmath19 within that small error @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , tnr acts _ locally _ : the coarse - graining of the tensor network at point @xmath52 only depends on the tensors in an immediate neighborhood @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention three consequences for the resulting mera . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) since tnr is not aware of the system size @xmath14 or inverse temperature @xmath2 , it produces the same tensors @xmath53 and disentanglers and isometries for the ground state @xmath19 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath54 ) as it does for the states @xmath10 and @xmath55 at finite @xmath2 or @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a single tnr calculation produces an accurate mera approximation for all these states . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in the absence of translation invariance , where a different tensor @xmath56 may be required for each site @xmath57 of the lattice , the coarse - graining of different parts of the system can be conducted in parallel , leading to a massive reduction in computational time . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) at a conceptual level , locality of tnr implies the validity of the _ theory of minimal updates _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theory , which asserts that only certain parts of the mera need to be changed in order to account for a localized change in the hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite , is particularly useful in the study of systems with boundaries , defects , or interfaces @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , in this letter we have shown that , when applied to the euclidean path integral restricted to several geometries , tnr @xcite produces a mera for the ground state and thermal states of a quantum hamiltonian , and have explored a number of consequences of this result . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by briefly mentioning two more implications . </S>",
    "<S> first , thanks to this connection , tnr inherits from the mera its ability to define an rg flow in the space of wave - functions and hamiltonians @xcite . notice that extracting the emergent physics from these rg flows should be easier ( both conceptually and computationally ) than extracting it from the rg flow in the more abstract space of tensors , eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : tensorflow ] . </S>",
    "<S> second , although we have focused on quantum systems , tnr can also be applied to statistical partition functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the present construction extends the mera formalism ( including strategies to extract universal critical properties @xcite ) to classical statistical systems .    </S>",
