    "the emergence of synchronization in ensembles of dynamical units is a universal phenomenon that is vital to the functionality of many natural and man - made systems  @xcite .",

    "for example , the sources and loads that make up power grids must reach consensus to avoid power failures , but reaching a common frequency alone is not enough ; the system is most efficient near a certain reference frequency of approximately @xmath0 - @xmath1 hz , and may fail if the collective dynamics are too far from this range  @xcite . in a wide variety of disciplines , from biology and neuroscience to mechanical and electrical engineering",
    ", there are vital systems whose functionality is jeopardized if the collective frequency or velocity differs too much from a given reference frequency ; examples include brain dynamics , cardiac excitation , consensus networks , and coordination of muscle movements in the digestive track  @xcite . in the case of cardiac excitation , for instance",
    ", rapid oscilations can give rise to dynamical instabilities that often precede ventricular fibrillation and eventually heart failure .",
    "in the majority of works studying the dynamics of network synchronization , it is often assumed that the collective frequency of the synchronized state is precisely the mean natural frequency of the individual units  @xcite . in other words",
    ", the synchronized state reaches an oscillation frequency that is equal to the unweighted average of the oscillation frequencies of the individual elements when acting in isolation , i.e. , uncoupled . in this article",
    "we study the collective frequency of self - organizing systems of oscillators and show that it is _ not _ in general equal to the mean of the individuals natural frequencies .",
    "we find that collective frequency variation is a consequence of the directedness of network and heterogeneity of the dynamics . for networks lacking either ,",

    "for instance , eq .  ( [ eq:01 ] ) can be obtained from linearizing self - organizing systems around the synchronized manifold , for instance the kuramoto model which serves as a model for a wide range of synchronization phenomena including power grid dynamics  @xcite , as well as other systems with more general coupling which are utilized in modeling excitable- and reaction - diffusion - type systems  @xcite .",
    "this linear relaxation has been found to accurately capture the dynamics of the system , provided that initial conditions are within the basin of attraction of the synchronized state  @xcite . in the case of a network of coupled oscillators",

    "we study the frequency - synchronized state , given by @xmath18 , and quantify the collective frequency variation by examining @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the collective frequency of the synchronized population and @xmath21 is the mean natural frequency .",
    "we call this difference the _ collective frequency variation_. we show that under generic conditions which are present in most practical application , when the frequencies @xmath6 are non - identical and the in- and out - degrees @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not perfectly balanced , then @xmath24 . however , when the in- and out - degrees match for each node in the network , @xmath25 , then the collective frequency variation vanishes , i.e. , @xmath26 , for any choice of frequencies .",

    "[ sec5 ] we study collective frequency variation in the power grid as a real example . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "we begin by writing eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) in vector form , @xmath30 our aim is to calculate the collective frequency of the synchronized population , and therefore we propose the ansatz @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a vector encoding the steady - state value of each @xmath3 in an appropriate rotating frame , @xmath33^t$ ] , and @xmath20 is the collective frequency . to proceed",
    ", we will utilize the pseudoinverse @xmath34 of the laplacian matrix , which satisfies @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite . in the undirected case",
    ", @xmath34 can be found using the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath9 , whereas in the more general case of a directed network , @xmath34 is formulated in terms of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath9 . in particular , if @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the singular values which are ordered @xmath39 and make up the diagonal entries of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding left and right singular vectors that make up the columns of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , then the pseudoinverse is given by @xmath45 .",
    "an important distinction between @xmath9 and @xmath34 is that , while @xmath9 maps all constant vectors to zero since its rows sum to zero , this is not generally true of @xmath34 , whose nullspace is nontrivial .",
    "furthermore , the sets of singular vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( appropriately normalized ) each form an orthonormal basis for @xmath48 .        proceeding with the analysis",
    ", we insert eq .",
    "( [ eq:03 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:02 ] ) and rearrange to obtain @xmath49 left - multiplying by @xmath50 , and using that @xmath35 , we find @xmath51 equations  ( [ eq:04 ] ) and ( [ eq:05 ] ) thus imply that @xmath52 next , since @xmath28 , the matrix @xmath53 can be simplified to @xmath54 .",
    "finally , we left - multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq:06 ] ) by @xmath55 , rearrange , and subtract @xmath56 from the right- and left - hand sides to obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the inner product .",
    "this result is in good agreement with previous research on consensus systems . in particular , by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq:02 ] ) with respect to time , using the initial condition @xmath59 , and noting that the first left singular vector and first left eigenvector are equal , we find that our derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:07 ] ) provides a complementary derivation of eq .",
    "( 23 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:07 ] ) gives the collective frequency variation @xmath19 of a synchronized population as the projection of the natural frequency vector @xmath60 ( shifted to have zero mean ) onto the first left singular vector @xmath27 .",
    "the physical interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:07 ] ) is that the collective frequency variation is a weighted average of the natural frequencies , wherein the weights are proportional to the entries of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , nodes with large entries in @xmath27 contribute more to the collective frequency variation than those with small entries , allowing for non - zero values of @xmath19 provided that the entries of @xmath27 are not identical .",
    "furthermore , we can formulate the full range of collective frequencies for a given network as the maximum of @xmath61 over all choices of @xmath62 with some fixed variance . as we will show below",
    ", the first left singular vector @xmath27 induces a centrality measure for the network that is related to the out - flow of each node .",
    "interestingly , we will show that this centrality is analogous to a `` reverse '' pagerank .",
    "in fact , it is equivalent to google s pagerank centrality for the network obtained by reversing the direction of each link in the original network .",
    "we demonstrate our main result , eq .  , with a simple example using two small networks of size @xmath63 , which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "both networks contain @xmath64 links , yielding a mean in- and out - degree of @xmath65 ; however , in network  ( a ) the links are made randomly so the in- and out - degrees at each node are not necessarily equal , while network ( b ) is balanced so that the links are made to satisfy @xmath66 for all @xmath7 , but is still directed . for visual distinction ,",
    "each node s area is proportional to the out - to - in - degree ratio @xmath67 .",
    "next , we draw a set of normally distributed natural frequencies with mean @xmath68 and variance @xmath69 and calculate for each network the collective frequency variation @xmath19 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:07 ] ) for @xmath70 different permutations of these frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , we plot the observed density @xmath71 for networks ( a ) and ( b ) ( solid blue and dashed red , respectively ) . in the generic case ,",
    "network ( a ) , where in- and out - degrees are not necessarily equal at each node , we observe a wide range of collective frequencies , while for network ( b ) , where the balance @xmath72 is maintained , the collective frequency is zero in each case , resulting in a delta function @xmath73 .",
    "this example highlights two important properties .",
    "first , the collective frequency variation is intimately linked with the directedness of a network : once the balance @xmath72 is broken , a non - zero value of @xmath19 should be expected .",
    "second , the precise value of @xmath19 depends not only on the network and set of natural frequencies , but the arrangement of natural frequencies ( dynamical heterogeneity ) on the network . therefore , for a fixed network and set of oscillator frequencies , depending on how the oscillators are assigned on the network , the system s collective frequency may either be faster or slower than the mean frequency .",
    "a natural question to ask of a given network is : what is the range of possible collective frequency variations ?",
    "we formalize this by considering for a given network , the magnitude of the maximum collective frequency variation across all frequency vectors with fixed variance @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 . inspecting eq .",
    "( [ eq:07 ] ) , it is straight - forward to see that the collective frequency variation is maximized when the shifted natural frequency vector @xmath60 is aligned with the first left singular vector @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the choices of @xmath62 that maximize @xmath61 with mean @xmath56 and variance @xmath74 are precisely @xmath76 where @xmath77 and the + and - symbols correspond to maximizing and minimizing @xmath19 , respectively ( that is , assuming @xmath78 for each @xmath7 ) .",
    "this yields a collective frequency variation range of @xmath79     and various mean degrees , the collective frequency variation range @xmath75 for @xmath69.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and various mean degrees , the collective frequency variation range @xmath75 for @xmath69.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to investigate how the range of collective frequency variation depends on network structure , we consider a variety of erds - rnyi  @xcite ( er ) and scale - free ( sf ) networks .",
    "er networks are constructed using a link probability @xmath80 that describes the probability of directed link @xmath16 existing .",
    "sf networks are built using the configuration model  @xcite for target in- and out- degrees drawn from the distribution @xmath81 for @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is an enforced minimum degree .",
    "the mean degree for er and sf networks can be tuned according to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . in our experiment , we fix @xmath86 and construct networks of size @xmath87 with various mean degrees and compute the collective frequency range according to eq .   with @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) , we plot the results for over @xmath88 er and sf network realizations , respectively ; we denote the mean and standard deviations using the symbols and dashed curves , respectively . for both network families",
    ", the collective frequency variation range tends to increase as the networks become more sparse .",
    "the central difference we observe is that both the mean collective frequency variation range and its standard deviation tend to be larger for sf networks than for er networks .",
    "this suggests that structural heterogeneity has an amplifying effect on the range of collective frequency variation for a network ",
    "however this effect can be mitigated on average by saturating the network structure : as the average connectivity increases , the range of collective frequency variation diminishes .    to better understand the role of network structure in determining collective frequency variation ,",
    "we ask the following : for which network structures is the collective frequency variation exactly zero ?",
    "that is , which network structures yield @xmath89 regardless of the choice of @xmath62 ? from eq .",
    "( [ eq:07 ] ) , it follows that @xmath89 for any @xmath62 whenever the entries of @xmath27 are all identical , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "we note that since @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , and @xmath28 , then @xmath27 must satisfy @xmath93 , or equivalently @xmath27 is the leading right eigenvector of @xmath94 . at each entry , we must have @xmath95 , and therefore by inserting @xmath96 ( for any @xmath97 ) it is easy to see then that @xmath90 implies that the network must be degree - balanced , i.e. , @xmath72 for all @xmath7 .",
    "the converse follows from a simple application of the perron - frobenius theorem  @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath90 is a solution of the leading right eigenvalue equation for @xmath94 , and the perron - frobenius theorem implies that it is in fact the unique solution , provided that the network is strongly connected .",
    "therefore , any given network generically has zero collective frequency variation if and only if @xmath72 for all @xmath7 .",
    "given the non - uniformity of each oscillator s contribution to a network s collective frequency variation , we now turn our attention to the properties of the first left singular vector @xmath27 , which dictates the contribution of each oscillator to the collective frequency variation .",
    "first , we note that the entries @xmath98 are positive , and thus @xmath27 induces a centrality measure for the network .",
    "the positiveness of the entries follows from applying the perron - frobenious theorem  @xcite to the irreducible and non - negative matrix @xmath99 and noting that @xmath27 is the leading right eigenvector of the matrix .",
    "the role of @xmath27 as the leading right eigenvector of @xmath94 also elucidates its structural properties . in particular , google s pagerank centrality  which tends to favor nodes with strong in - flow  is given by the leading right eigenvector @xmath100 of the matrix @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is a damping factor  @xcite .",
    "formally the pagerank of a network represents the steady - state of a markovian random - walk on the network . when the damping factor is set to zero and each directed link",
    "is reversed , the matrix @xmath104 from which pagerank is calculated is equal to @xmath105 ( for which @xmath27 is the leading right eigenvector ) .",

    "specifically , various algorithms and techniques exist for analysis and optimization which might be applied to manipulate a network s collective frequency variation . for instance , given the inverse relationship between the first left singular vector centrality and pagerank , we expect that increasing ( decreasing ) a node s pagerank corresponds to decreasing ( increasing ) its contribution to the collective frequency variation .",
    "the power grid represents a prime example of a network of self - organizing dynamical systems whose functionality we rely on everyday  without robust synchronization near a specified range ( @xmath123 50 - 60 hz ) , our power supply is jeopardized .",
    "power grids  @xcite are widely modeled using the following system of second - order differential equations : @xmath124 where @xmath125 represents the mechanical phase of oscillator @xmath7 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 represent the inertial and damping constants , respectively , @xmath128 represents the generated or consumed power of oscillator @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the global coupling strength , and @xmath129 is a phase - lag parameter for the interaction between oscillators @xmath7 and @xmath130 .",

    "note in particular that the effective coupling matrices are directed , i.e. , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "different power grid models treat the inertial term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) differently  @xcite . in certain models",
    "the inertial term @xmath126 depends on the role of oscillator @xmath7 : if oscillator @xmath7 is a source , or power generator , @xmath126 is nonzero , but if it is a load , or power consumer , @xmath126 is zero and thus the equation for oscillator @xmath7 is a first - order differential equation .",

    "<S> a wide range of natural and engineered phenomena rely on large networks of interacting units to reach a dynamical consensus state where the system collectively operates . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamics of self - organizing systems and show that for generic directed networks the collective frequency of the ensemble is _ not _ the same as the mean of the individuals natural frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that the collective frequency equals a weighted average of the natural frequencies , where the weights are given by an out - flow centrality measure that is equivalent to a reverse pagerank centrality . </S>",
    "<S> our findings uncover an intricate dependence of the collective frequency on both the structural directedness and dynamical heterogeneity of the network , and also reveal an unexplored connection between synchronization and pagerank , which opens the possibility of applying pagerank optimization to synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the presence of collective frequency variation in real - world networks by considering the uk and scandinavian power grids . </S>"
