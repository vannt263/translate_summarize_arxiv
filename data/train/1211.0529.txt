    "the aim of this paper is to develop the theory of duals for gray categories .",
    "the principal tool is a diagrammatic calculus introduced in this paper .",
    "this can be viewed as a higher - categorical , three - dimensional analogue of the diagrams used for computations in pivotal categories .",
    "many of the algebraic results on gray categories with duals can be understood in terms of the geometry of the corresponding diagrams .",
    "our main motivation are the applications of higher categories in ( extended ) topological quantum field theory , quantum geometry and conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "for instance , one would like to construct topological quantum field theories with ` defects ' .",
    "these are theories in which certain embedded submanifolds are labelled with geometric data . in three dimensions ,",
    "it is natural that the data on these decorated submanifolds should arise from a tricategory .",
    "an example of this is the work on the relation between reshetikhin - turaev and turaev - viro invariants @xcite . in this case , the relevant higher category is the center of a spherical category , which is a tricategory with a single object and a single 1-morphism .",
    "another example is the tricategory of bimodule categories , which plays an important role in conformal field theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the notion of duals is required to incorporate orientation .",
    "if data from a tricategory is used to label distinguished submanifolds , orientation reversal of these submanifolds must be reflected in a corresponding structure in the tricategory , namely the duals .",
    "another important motivation is the benefit of diagrams for computations in higher categories that arises from a direct relation between geometry and structures in the category .",
    "that the diagrams have a non - trivial geometric content is familiar from the example of ribbon categories and knots , or more generally , ribbon graphs embedded in three - dimensional space .",
    "the reshetikhin - turaev invariants @xcite define a functor which takes ribbon graphs in three - dimensional space decorated with data from a ribbon category and evaluates them in the category itself .",
    "the relations in the category imply invariance of the evaluation under homeomorphisms of three - dimensional space . in this way",
    "the homeomorphism invariance is the geometric expression of the relations in the category .",
    "this article does not consider general tricategories , but restricts attention to gray categories . as every tricategory is triequivalent to a gray category @xcite and there is no stricter version of a tricategory with this property , gray categories can be viewed as maximally strict tricategories .",
    "the practical reason for using gray categories is the wish to avoid a degree of complexity that makes algebraic manipulations nearly impossible .",
    "the deeper reason is that the coherence data for gray categories is precisely that part of the coherence data for tricategories that can be given a diagrammatic meaning .",
    "an analogous situation arises for pivotal tensor categories .",
    "there is a weak and a strict notion of monoidal structure and of duality and the diagrams for pivotal tensor categories reflect precisely the coherence data for a strict pivotal category with strict monoidal structure , while the rest of its coherence data is not given a diagrammatic representation .    section 2 of the paper introduces diagrams for gray categories without duals .",
    "this is a generalisation of the diagrammatic calculus for braided monoidal categories introduced by joyal and street @xcite .",
    "the diagrams for gray categories are located in a cube with the three coordinate axes corresponding to the three compositions in a gray category .",
    "these diagrams consist of 3- , 2- , 1- , and 0-dimensional strata which are labelled , respectively , with objects and 1- , 2- , 3-morphisms in a gray category .",
    "the categorical axioms are introduced in an ` unpacked ' manner .",
    "we see this concreteness as an advantage , both in view of possible applications in state sum models and because this yields a direct link between categories and geometry .",
    "section 3 introduces gray categories with duals using the definition of baez and langford @xcite but with some minor modifications .",
    "the diagrammatic representation of the data for these duals is explained in this section .",
    "the gray categories possess two types of duals , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which correspond , in a sense explained in this paper , to @xmath2 degree rotations around two different coordinate axes .",
    "the @xmath3 duals are familiar from pivotal or ribbon categories but the @xmath1 duals are a feature of gray categories that does not appear in the pivotal or ribbon cases .",
    "the coherence data for @xmath1 is such that it matches the appearance of folds and cusps in projections of surfaces . as in the case of gray categories ,",
    "the duals considered in this paper are not the most general ones , and their axioms could be weakened .",
    "again , the strictness of the axioms ensures that all their coherence data has a diagrammatic representation .    our first central result in section 4 concerns the algebraic structure of these duality operations .",
    "the duals extend in a canonical way to ( partially contravariant ) functors of strict tricategories @xmath4 with @xmath5 and define natural isomorphisms @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the structure maps for these natural isomorphisms are interpreted geometrically in terms of diagrams . by investigating a closely - related natural isomorphism @xmath8 one obtains two diagrams that are homeomorphic , but whose evaluations are not necessarily equal .",
    "this motivates the definition of a spatial gray category as a gray category with duals in which such an equality holds .",
    "this condition is a generalisation of the ribbon condition for a ribbon category .",
    "section 5 contains the second important result : a strictification theorem for the duals . while the functor of strict tricategories @xmath9 satisfies the identity @xmath5 , which corresponds to its geometrical interpretation , the functor @xmath10 satisfies such an identity only up to a natural isomorphism .",
    "similarly , the functor @xmath11 whose geometrical counterpart is the identity rotation of @xmath12 , is not equal to the identity functor but only isomorphic to it .",
    "however , a spatial gray category can be strictified ( in the sense of @xcite ) to one in which these duality functors do indeed satisfy the relations for 180 degree rotations around different coordinate axes :    every spatial gray category with duals can be strictified to a gray category whose duals @xmath4 satisfy @xmath5 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus the geometrical interpretation of the action of @xmath1 as a rotation is restored for higher morphisms , which justifies the original set of duality axioms .",
    "the proof for this result is conceptually clear and may be of independent interest .",
    "section 6 explores in more depth the relation between gray categories with duals and their diagrams .",
    "the diagrams in this paper have no framing .",
    "this is adequate to express all of the axioms for the category and also the structure maps for the duality functors .",
    "however it does restrict the generality of the invariance results .",
    "diagrams are labelled with category data using a generalisation of ` blackboard framing ' familiar from knot theory .",
    "these diagrams are called standard . the general invariance result in this section holds for a large class of gray category diagrams , called surface diagrams , whose 0- , 1- and 2-strata form a surface with a boundary .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be standard surface diagrams that are labelled with a spatial gray category .",
    "let @xmath17 be an oriented isomorphism of standard surface diagrams and the labels of @xmath16 induced from @xmath15 by @xmath18 .",
    "then the evaluations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are equal .",
    "there is a caveat with this result .",
    "it depends on the conjecture that the moves on folds and cusps in the pl setting are the analogues of the moves in the smooth case .",
    "whie this appears to be a reasonable conjecture we do not know of any previous work on this problem .    for surface diagrams",
    ", the result indicates that there are no further conditions other than the spatial condition on a gray category with duals that are needed to prove invariance under homeomorphisms .",
    "essentially it arises because surface diagrams have a uniquely determined notion of framing .",
    "it seems that to extends this result to all gray category diagrams would require a general definition of framing ; whilst this is an interesting problem we leave it for future work .",
    "this relation between the geometry of the diagrams and the algebraic structures in a gray category with duals is particularly apparent in the gray category diagrams for closed oriented surfaces . in section 7 ,",
    "these diagrams are related to a notion of trace in a gray category with duals , which generalises the traces considered in @xcite and defines invariants of oriented surfaces labelled with data from a gray category with duals .",
    "these invariants allow one to compute the euler characteristic of a surface .    in section 8",
    "we investigate examples of gray categories with duals that arise from the gray category 2cat .",
    "we analyse the structure of subcategories of 2cat that carry the structure of a gray category with duals and construct two concrete examples based on such subcategories .",
    "the aim of this section is to develop a diagrammatic calculus for gray categories and to show that the evaluation of diagrams labelled with gray category data is invariant under certain mappings of diagrams .",
    "this can be viewed as a higher - dimensional analogue of the diagrams that are called spin network diagrams in the physics literature , string diagrams in the mathematics literature and tangle diagrams in knot theory .",
    "they are dual to the more common pasting diagrams of the category theory literature .",
    "the diagrams for an @xmath19-category are located in a geometrical ` cube ' @xmath20^n$ ] .",
    "it should be possible to define diagrams analogous to the ones considered here for arbitrary dimension @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is most practical to be guided by known examples rather than abstract formalism",
    ". hence this work considers the cases only up to @xmath21 .",
    "the evaluation of an @xmath19-dimensional diagram labelled with @xmath19-category data will be defined inductively , in terms of a projection to an @xmath22-dimensional diagram labelled with @xmath22-category data .",
    "for this reason , the definition of gray category diagrams and their mappings , which corresponds to @xmath21 requires a careful discussion of their lower - dimensional counterparts .",
    "we start with a discussion of one - dimensional diagrams , then we treat the two - dimensional case before introducing diagrams for gray categories , which correspond to @xmath21 . at each stage , we discuss the @xmath19-dimensional diagrams , their mappings as well as their labelling with data from an @xmath19-category and their evaluation . throughout the article , we work in the piecewise - linear framework , although diagrams are often drawn smoothly for better legibility .",
    "we start by considering the one - dimensional case , which is required for the definitions in higher dimensions , but also can be viewed as a toy - model that exhibits the general features of the construction .",
    "a one - dimensional diagram is a finite set of points , called vertices , in the interior of the unit interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the complement of the vertices is a disjoint union of its connected components , which are called regions of the diagram .    as in higher dimensions ,",
    "one - dimensional diagrams are a purely topological construction .",
    "they become _ category diagrams _ once decorated with data from a category @xmath23 . a category diagram with a single vertex",
    "is called an elementary diagram . a general category diagram",
    "can then be defined in terms of the elementary diagrams .",
    "let @xmath24 be a category .    1 .",
    "an elementary category diagram for @xmath23 is a one - dimensional diagram with one vertex together with a morphism @xmath25 in @xmath24 .",
    "the object @xmath26 is associated with the region containing 0 , @xmath27 with the region containing 1 , and @xmath18 with the vertex .",
    "2 .   a category diagram for @xmath24 is a one - dimensional diagram together with a labelling of each region with an object in @xmath24 and a labelling of each vertex with a morphism in @xmath24 .",
    "every vertex is required to have a neighbourhood that is isomorphic to an elementary diagram .",
    "this means that the morphism at a vertex @xmath28 $ ] is a morphism from the object labelling the region ` above ' @xmath29 ( i.e. at values less than @xmath29 ) to the region below @xmath29 .",
    "the benefit of category diagrams and their higher - dimensional counterparts is that they allow one to visualise a calculation in the category @xmath23 .",
    "this calculation is called the evaluation of the diagram .",
    "[ 1d_eval ] the evaluation of a category diagram is the product of the morphisms at the vertices in the order of increasing values of @xmath29 .",
    "it maps the object for the region containing 0 to the object for the region containing 1 ( see figure [ 1catdiagram ] ) . a diagram without vertices",

    "the usefulness of diagrams for visualising calculations in ( higher ) categories is due to the fact that their evaluation is invariant under certain manipulations of diagrams such as homeomorphisms of diagrams and subdivisions .",
    "a precise formulation of this idea requires the notion of a mapping of diagrams .",
