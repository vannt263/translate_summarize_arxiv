    "resonant tunneling of electrons through bound states in mesoscopic double barrier devices still attracts wide research activities .",
    "not only the current flow is of interest . due to the granularity of the electron charge",
    "the tunneling current is a discrete stochastic process which leads to shot noise in the current signal @xcite .",
    "the spectral power density gives information about temporal correlations which are not available by conductance measurements alone . in the pioneering theoretical work of l. y. chen et al .",
    "@xcite a suppression of the zero - frequency spectral power density @xmath0 with respect to the uncorrelated value @xmath1 ( poissonian noise , @xmath2 is the elementary charge , @xmath3 is the average current ) in tunneling through double barriers was obtained .",
    "this refers to negative correlations in the tunneling current due to pauli s exclusion principle : if the bound state becomes occupied by tunneling of an electron , then a subsequent electron `` has to wait '' until the state becomes empty .",
    "hence , negative correlations are a fingerprint of the fermionic statistics of electrons .",
    "contrarily , boson statistics lead to positive correlations , e.g. in the intensity - intensity correlation function of emission of photons from a black radiation source due to temporal bunching of emission events ( @xcite and references therein ) .    for tunneling through quantum dots",
    "( qds ) coulomb interaction generates an additional source of correlations .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for an asymmetric setup of the tunneling rates in a system of two capacitively coupled qd states the current - voltage characteristic exhibits negative differential conductance . in this regime",
    "positive correlations in the tunneling current are present ( super - poissonian shot noise ) . here",
    ", we give a detailed examination of this effect and show that its origin is related to bunching of tunneling events due to coulomb blocking .",
    "positive correlations in tunneling current were also investigated in a double barrier resonant tunneling diode @xcite , in coupled metallic qds @xcite , and in a single - electron transistor setup @xcite .",
    "we consider two qd single - particle states with energies @xmath4 which are coupled to emitter / collector contacts by tunneling rates @xmath5 ( @xmath6 1,2 ) , respectively .",
    "the emitter / collector contact is assumed to be in local equilibrium and the occupation is given by the fermi functions @xmath7 and chemical potentials @xmath8 , respectively . an applied bias voltage @xmath9 drives the qd system out of equilibrium .",
    "the tunneling energy @xmath10 is given by the difference of energies before and after a tunneling process considering the charging energy @xmath11 which is present if both qd states are occupied .",
    "the time evolution of the occupation probabilities @xmath12 for the fock states @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath6 1,2 ) is described by the master equation @xmath15 .",
    "the 4@xmath164-matrix @xmath17 consists of the transition rates for tunneling into or out of the qd system which contain the occupation of the contacts and the tunneling rates ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the stationary current is given by @xmath18 with the stationary occupation probability given by @xmath19 and the operator for the current at the emitter barrier @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the current - current correlation function at the emitter barrier for @xmath21 is @xmath22 with the time translation operator @xmath23 so that @xmath24 holds @xcite .",
    "then , the spectral power density reads ( wiener - khintchine theorem ) @xmath25 . as a measure for correlations at the emitter barrier",
    "the fano factor is defined as @xmath26 which is unity for uncorrelated tunneling , @xmath27 for negative correlations , and @xmath28 for positive correlations in the tunneling current ( super - poissonian shot noise ) .",
    "note that @xmath29 , but @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "vs. @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( white lines correspond to @xmath34 and confine the regions @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "b ) schematic realisations of current @xmath37 vs. time @xmath38 through level @xmath39 ( upper plot ) and @xmath40 ( lower plot ) for @xmath411 . ]",
    "[ fig1 ]    we consider the case where both energies of the qd single - particle states are equal : @xmath42 , the tunneling rates to the emitter are equal : @xmath43 , and a bias voltage @xmath44 is applied such that both single - particle states @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be occupied but the occupancy of the doubly - occupied state @xmath47 is energetically forbidden .",
    "then , the zero - frequency fano factor is derived analytically to be    @xmath48 }       { \\left(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2+\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\right)^2 }       \\label{eq : fano}\\ ] ]    with the ratios of collector and emitter tunneling rates @xmath49 ( @xmath6 1,2 ) .",
    "the dependence of the fano factor on @xmath50 and @xmath51 is depicted in fig.1a .",
    "the fano factor is symmetric with respect to an interchange of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "two different regions corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53 are labeled by @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the region @xmath36 indicates negative correlations in the tunneling current for @xmath54 ( @xmath6 1,2 ) . in this regime , mutual coulomb blocking of the single - particle states @xmath45 and @xmath46 is negligible since the levels are mostly empty in time average due to the stronger collector coupling .",
    "if either one ratio or both ratios become smaller than unity the tunneling is positively correlated ( region @xmath35 in fig .",
    "1a ) except for @xmath55 where @xmath56 approaches unity .",
    "hence , the conditions for positive correlations are : @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . to illustrate the effect of positive correlations we consider a realisation of time - dependent currents @xmath60 and @xmath61 through the levels 1 and 2 , respectively , in fig .",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath411 .",
    "if an electron jumps from the emitter into level 1 ( black peak ) this level becomes occupied .",
    "until the level becomes empty by tunneling of the electron out in the collector ( grey peak ) no electrons can jump in level 2 ( coulomb blocking ) . only if level 1 is empty , a current @xmath62 is flowing .",
    "hence , a bunching of tunneling events in current @xmath61 occurs .    in fig .",
    "2 the frequency - dependent fano factor @xmath63 and in the insets of fig . 2 the current - current correlation function @xmath64 at the emitter barrier are shown .",
    "the dashed curve @xmath63 represents the case @xmath651 .",
    "it exhibits a minimum at @xmath660 and approaches unity for @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding correlation function in the left inset is negative for all times , i.e. only negative correlations are present ( region @xmath36 in fig.1a ) . by lowering @xmath50 below one a maximum at @xmath68 and two minima symmetric to @xmath660 arise ( dotted curve : @xmath690.4 , @xmath701 ; full curve : @xmath690.2 , @xmath701 )",
    ". the correlation function ( full curve in the right inset of fig .",
    "2 ) belonging to the full curve @xmath71 ( @xmath721 , @xmath35-region in fig .",
    "1a ) has now two contributions with different signs : positive ( dotted curve ) and negative ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the positive part of the correlation function is due to the bunching of tunneling events as discussed with respect to fig . 1b and",
    "the negative part is due to anti - bunching caused by pauli s exclusion principle which is still present in the bunches of tunneling through the current carrying level .",
    "therefore , the frequency - dependent fano factor in fig . 2 consists of a sum of two lorentzians with either positive or negative sign and different fwhm corresponding to the two time scales related to the respective collector tunneling rates .    [ fig2 ]     vs. frequency @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( dashed curve ) , @xmath76 ( dotted curve ) , and @xmath77 ( full curve ) .",
    "insets : current - current correlation functions at the emitter barrier @xmath78 vs. time @xmath38 ( full curves ) ; dashed curve : negative part of @xmath78 , dotted curve : positive part of @xmath78 . ]",
    "we discussed the effect of positive correlations in the tunneling current through two single - particle states in a regime where mutual coulomb blocking leads to bunching of tunneling events .",
    "we showed that the current - current correlation function at one barrier consists of the sum of a negative and a positive term for an asymmetric choice of the tunneling rates of both qd states .",
    "then , the corresponding spectral power density is a sum of two lorentzians with different fwhm and different signs which gives rise to a maximum in the zero - frequency fano factor and which can become larger than one ( super - poissonian shot noise ) ."
