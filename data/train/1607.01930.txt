    "kitagawa and ueda @xcite proposed the generation of spin - squeezed states , which redistributes the uncertainity unevenly between the two components of the total angular momentum and the component with the reduced uncertainity can be utilized for precision measurements with applications in atomic clocks @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite.atomic spin squeezing requires nonlinear interactions between spins which can be realized by one - axis twisting and two - axis counter - twisting @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement / correlations among the spins is responsible for spin squeezing . in this context",
    "it has been found in various models that quantum fisher information ( qfi ) together with spin squeezing(ss ) are connected to quantum entanglement @xcite .    in the context of bose - einstein condensates ,",

    "approximate analytical expressions of spin squeezing and quantum fisher information are derived under the frozen spin approximation @xcite .",
    "we show for the first time that both maximum ss and quantum entanglement exists in the superradiant phase near the critical point .",
    "spin squeezing dynamics and chaos of the dicke model has been studied earlier @xcite while a recent study explored the influence of rabi oscillation energy on quantum fisher information and phase sensitivity of bec in a double - well potential @xcite .",
    "exact numerical analysis of spin squeezing in different atomic systems has been performed earlier @xcite .",
    "we consider a rb atomic bec optically trapped in an optical cavity as described in ref . @xcite . under the two - mode approximation , only the atomic states , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) ground state @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",

    "these two states @xmath2 and @xmath5 are coupled by an ancillary excited state @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 states coupled by the quantized optical cavity field strength @xmath10 and an external classical field strength @xmath11 respectively .",
    "an effective two - level configuration can be obtained after adiabatically eliminating the ancillary excited state @xmath12 under the assumption of large one - photon detuning . following the work of @xcite , one obtains an effective jc - dicke hamiltonian for @xmath13 number of atoms    @xmath14    where    @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 .",

    "now taking @xmath41 , we rewrite the hamiltonian of eqn.(1 ) as    @xmath42    in the bad cavity limit , the decay rate of cavity photons ( @xmath43 ) is much larger than any other rates of the system and the cavity field always follows the atomic dynamics adiabatically . under this assumption",

    "in this section , we will work in the heisenberg picture and study in detail the spin squeezing and quantum fisher information in the hamiltonian of eqn.(3 ) .",
    "in particular , we will explore the dependence of ss and qfi on the atom - photon coupling strength .",
    "following the criteria of kitagawa and ueda of spin squeezing @xcite , we introduce the squeezing parameter    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the minimal spin fluctuation in a plane perpendicular to the mean spin direction . when @xmath49 , the spin systems are uncorrelated while @xmath50 signifies spin squeezing and a signature of entanglement .    now in order to study qfi in our system , we follow @xcite who in order to characterize multi - particle entanglement in an @xmath13 qubit state had introduced the following quantity @xmath51 ( termed as rmqfi ) ,    @xmath52},\\ ] ]    where , @xmath53 $ ] is the quantum fisher information and @xmath54 is an arbitrary direction . here , @xmath55 implies multi - particle entanglement . following @xcite , the expression for @xmath56",
    "can be written for our system as ,    @xmath57    where , @xmath58 is the maximum variance in a plane perpendicular to the mean spin direction .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) demonstrates a second - order superradiant quantum phase transition at the critical point @xmath59 . in order to determine the critical point @xmath59 , we start with the heisenberg equations of moton of the angular momentum operators @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the steady state values of the cavity field operators @xmath63",
    ".    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    a steady state analysis for @xmath68 ( corresponds to the normal phase i.e. all atoms are in the lower state ) of the above mean field equations of motion ( for large @xmath13 ) yields the critical value as    @xmath69    starting from the hamiltonian ( 3 ) , we now examine the generation and coherent control of spin squeezing and quantum fisher information .",
    "we prepare the system to start from the lowest eigenstate of @xmath62 , @xmath70 . in order to investigate the quantum spin squeezing and quantum fisher information ,",
    "we examine the heisenberg equations of motion of @xmath71 and @xmath72 derived from hamiltonian ( 3 ) ,    @xmath73    @xmath74    if @xmath75 , @xmath76 , then the external field forced the total spin to freeze along the negative @xmath77 direction i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "this approximation is termed as frozen spin approximation @xcite which permits harmonic solutions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,    @xmath79    @xmath80    where ,    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    as evident from the above expressions , the analysis is valid in the superradiant phase i.e @xmath85 , since for @xmath86 , @xmath32 is not real .",
    "when the system starts from @xmath87 , the only non - vanishing spin component is @xmath88 because @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath90 @xmath92 at all times .",
    "now with the help of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we can investigate quantum spin squeezing and quantum fisher information .",
    "if @xmath93 @xmath90 @xmath94 @xmath95 , i.e. there is no correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the increase or reduced spin fluctuations occur either in the @xmath96 or @xmath97 direction .",
    "however in our case ,    @xmath98    consequently since @xmath99+@xmath94 @xmath100 @xmath92 , the reduced spin fluctuations neither occurs along @xmath96 nor along @xmath97 direction .",
    "now in order to determine the increased and reduced spin fluctuation directions , we introduce the spin component ,    @xmath101    where the unit vector @xmath102 , with @xmath103 as the angle between @xmath96 axis and @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath105 @xmath90 @xmath92 , the fluctuation of the spin component @xmath106 reads ,    @xmath107    the optimally squeezed angle @xmath108 is obtained via minimizing @xmath109 with respect to @xmath103 .",
    "this yields ,    @xmath110    .",
    "the squeezing parameter @xmath111 and rmqfi @xmath51 are determined as ,    @xmath112^{1/2},\\ ] ]    @xmath113^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     fig.1 shows the plot of spin squeezing parameter @xmath111 ( left plot ) and the quantum fisher information @xmath51 ( right plot ) as a function of @xmath114 for two values of @xmath115 ( solid line ) and @xmath116(dashed line ) .",
    "clearly for @xmath115 , both @xmath111 and @xmath51 has minimum values compared to that for @xmath116 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that near the critical point in the superradiant phase maximum spin squeezing and maximum quantum entanglement occurs . the close connection between spin squeezing and entanglement has been demonstrated earlier @xcite . as a function of times , periodically maximum squeezing and entanglement reoccurs .",
    "the fig.1 also illustrates that initially at @xmath117 , there is no spin squeezing but as the dynamics evolves , spin squeezing occurs .",
    "the atom - photon coupling then emerges as coherent handle to control the spin squeezing and quantum entanglement.in a recent experiment , bell correlations was reported between pseudo spins of about 480 atoms in a spin - squeezed bec @xcite .",
    "bell correlations also suggests entanglement .",
    "the present work is highly relevant to quantum information processing and precision spectroscopy .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spin squeezing and quantum fisher information dynamics in a nonlinear system composed of a bose - einstein condensate in an optical cavity .",
    "the nonlinearity emerges from the twisting and coupling of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 components of the angular momentum.the system represents a variant of the dicke model which undergoes a dicke quantum phase transition from the normal phase to a superradiant phase above a critical atom - photon coupling strength.it is found that near the critical point in the superradiant phase maximum spin squeezing can be achieved . at the same point where @xmath111 is minimum , @xmath51 is also found to be minimum which signifies that near the critical point in the superradiant phase , maximum quantum entanglement exists .",
