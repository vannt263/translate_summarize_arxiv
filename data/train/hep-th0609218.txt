    "in relativistic particle theories and string theories explicit time - dependent gauges are often used @xcite . not only this problem but also others are bringing out the necessity to formulate in general rules of quantization of time - dependent systems with constraints .",
    "the canonical quantization of time - dependent systems with constraints has been formulated by dirac @xcite and described in @xcite.the generalization of the dirac method of canonical quantization for the case of time - dependent constraints was described in the book of gitman and tyutin @xcite .",
    "a development of the method and examples can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "the interpretation of two general moments on which gitman - tyutin quantization ( gt - quantization ) is based is given .",
    "these are : formal introduction of a momentum @xmath0 conjugated to the time @xmath1 , and postulation of a special non - unitary schr@xmath2dinger time dependent of operators .",
    "here , we briefly describe the modification of the dirac method of quantization for time - dependent second - class constraints proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us have a theory in a hamiltonian formulation with second - class constraints @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which can explicitly depend on the time @xmath1 .",
    "then the equation of motion of such a system may be written in the usual form , if one formally introduces a momentum @xmath0 conjugated to the time @xmath1 , and defines the poisson bracket in the extended space of canonical variables @xmath5 ,    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a hamiltonian of the system , and @xmath8 is the notation for the dirac bracket with respect to a system of second - class constraints @xmath9 .",
    "the poisson bracket , wherever encountered , is henceforth understood to be one in such an above mentioned extended space .",
    "the total derivative of an arbitrary function @xmath10 , with allowance made for the equations ( 1 ) , has the form    @xmath11    in this case the quantization procedure in the schr@xmath2dinger picture can be formulated as follows .",
    "the variables @xmath12 of the theory are assigned the operators @xmath13 , which satisfy the equal - time commutation relations ( @xmath14 denotes the generalized commutator , commutator or anti - commutator depending on the parities of the variables ) , @xmath15 the constraints equation @xmath16 and equations of evaluation ( we disregard problems connected with operator ordering ) @xmath17    to each physical quantity @xmath18 given in the hamiltonian formalism by the function @xmath19 , we assign a schr@xmath2dinger operator @xmath20 by the rule @xmath21 ; in the same manner we construct the quantum hamiltonian @xmath22 , according to the classical hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "the time evaluation of the state vector @xmath24 in the schr@xmath2dinger picture is determined by the schr@xmath2dinger equation    @xmath25    from ( 3 ) it follows , in particular , that @xmath26 and , as a consequence of ( 2 ) , for arbitrary schr@xmath2dinger operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 we have    @xmath29    it is possible to see that quantum theories , which correspond to different initial data for the equation ( 3 ) , are equivalent .",
    "one can adduce some arguments in favor of the proposed quantization procedure .",
    "for instance , to check that the correspondence principle between classical and quantum equations of motion holds true in this procedure , we pass over to the heisenberg representation , whose operators @xmath30 are related to the operators @xmath31 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the operator of the evolution of the schr@xmath2dinger equation , @xmath34 heisenberg operator @xmath35 of an arbitrary physical quantity @xmath18 is constructed from the corresponding schr@xmath2dinger operator @xmath20 in the same manner @xmath36 .",
    "one can find the total time derivative of the heisenberg operator @xmath35 :    @xmath37    which coincides in form with the classical equation of motion .",
    "it follows from ( 5 ) that the heisenberg operators @xmath38 also satisfy the equation    @xmath39    besides , one can easily verify that the equal - time relations hold for these operators , @xmath40 these relations , together with ( 6 ) , may be regarded as a prescription of the quantization in the heisenberg picture for theories with time - dependent second - class constraints .",
    "note that the time dependence of heisenberg operators in the theories considered is not unitary in the general case .",
    "in other words , no such ( hamiltonian ) operator exists , whose commutator with a physical quantity would give its total time derivative .",
    "this is explained by the existence of two factors which determine the time evolution of the heisenberg operator .",
    "the first one is the unitary evolution of the state vector in the schr@xmath2dinger picture , while the second one is the time variation of schr@xmath2dinger operators @xmath41 , which in the general case is non - unitary .",
    "physically , this is explained by the fact that the dynamics develops on a surface which itself changes with time .",
    "let us show that the equation ( 1 ) arises naturally from a consideration of a modified formulation , which is trivial non - stationary .",
    "let @xmath42 be a time - dependent lagrangian of some singular theory , ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "one can consider another lagrangian @xmath44 , which depends on two supplementary variables @xmath45 and connected with origin lagrangian @xmath46 as :                    from the relation ( 10 ) one can find primarily expressible velocities @xmath54 and primary constraints @xmath55 , ( @xmath56),@xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 are constraints in the theory with lagrangian @xmath46 .",
    "then hamiltonian @xmath61 has the form : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is the hamiltonian of a theory with lagrangian @xmath46 .",
    "further , one can continue the dirac procedure to obtain @xmath78- multipliers and secondary constraints already with hamiltonian ( 12 ) [ 3 ] . using the dirac procedure for the constraints @xmath79",
    ", one can use the following hamiltonian @xmath80 instead of the hamiltonian ( 12 ) , where @xmath81 .",
    "this is so because of the constraints @xmath79 and secondary constraints , which can appear , do not contain the variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 be secondary constraints .",
    "then , @xmath85 where @xmath86 are secondary constraints of the theory with lagrangian @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that @xmath87 is a total system of constraints of the theory with lagrangian @xmath46 and is of second class .",
    "then the total system of constraints of the theory with lagrangian @xmath48 is also of second class and has the form @xmath88 @xmath89 because the constraints for the variables @xmath90 and @xmath83 have the special forms [ 3 ] , they can be merely excluded from the equations of motion by means of the constraints . in doing this , one can easily discover that the equations for the rest variables coincide with equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the quantization in schr@xmath2dinger picture of the theory in question may be formulated in the following form .",
    "we have a hamiltonian theory with canonical variables @xmath4 and @xmath91 .",
    "the surface of constraints is described by the equation @xmath92 the hamiltonian of the theory is @xmath7 . when quantizing , all variables became operators with commutation relations        one can verify that this quantization is fully equivalent to the gt - quantization in the schr@xmath2dinger picture .",
    "indeed , let us realize @xmath95 as operator of multiplication by the variable @xmath1 .",
    "then , @xmath96 from ( 11 ) we have @xmath97_{-}=0\\,;\\,\\,\\,\\,[\\stackrel{\\wedge } { \\eta } , \\stackrel{\\wedge } { \\epsilon } ] _ { -}=\\left .",
    "i\\{\\eta , \\epsilon \\}_{d(\\phi ) } \\right| _ { \\eta = \\stackrel{\\wedge } { \\eta } } .\\ ] ] and in the selected realization , @xmath98_{-}=i\\stackrel{\\wedge } { \\tau } , \\ ] ] the condition ( 3 ) follows from ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) . finally , the condition ( 14 ) is the schr@xmath2dinger equation .",
