    "with the advent of the proton cooler synchrotron cosy at jlich high precision data for associated strangeness production in proton - proton collisions , @xmath14 , have become available in the near threshold region @xcite .",
    "these data are of interest in several respects .",
    "first , they can provide a possibility to test various theoretical models of the strangeness dissociation mechanism for the nucleon .",
    "secondly , the cross sections for strangeness production in the elementary @xmath15-collision are an important input into transport model calculations of the strangeness production in heavy ion collisions",
    ". the latter may provide information about the hot and dense state of nuclear matter or the formation of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "various dynamical models have been developed for the reaction @xmath16 in refs.@xcite which in particular focus on the role of the @xmath17 nucleon resonance decaying into @xmath18 .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have developed a novel approach to pion and eta production in proton - proton collisions , @xmath19 , near threshold . in this approach one",
    "starts from the invariant t - matrix at threshold in the center - of - mass frame which is parametrized in terms of one ( or two ) constant threshold amplitudes .",
    "close to threshold the relative momentum of the nucleons in the final state is very small and their empirically known strong s - wave interaction plays an essential role in the description of the meson - production data .",
    "in fact is was found in ref.@xcite that in all three cases the energy dependence of the total cross section near threshold is completely and accurately determined by the three - body phase space and the on - shell s - wave nn final state interaction ( in the case @xmath20 also the s - wave @xmath21-interaction was included ) .",
    "close to threshold the final state interaction can even be treated in effective range approximation using the well - known values of the scattering lengths and effective range parameters .",
    "note that ref.@xcite gives a ( partial ) derivation of such an approach to final state interaction in the context of effective field theory ( i.e. using only feynman diagrams ) .",
    "once one accepts such a phenomenological separation of the ( on - shell ) final state interaction from the full production process , one can extract from the total cross section data an experimental value of the constant threshold amplitude parametrizing the t - matrix . in the next step a standard feynman diagram calculation",
    "is performed for the center - of - mass t - matrix at threshold .",
    "it was stressed in ref.@xcite that the evaluation of the feynman diagrams has to be done fully relativistically since non - relativistic approximations will in general fail to reproduce correctly certain nucleon propagators .",
    "the source of this problem is the extreme kinematics of the meson - production process with the external center - of - mass momentum @xmath22 being proportional to the square root of the nucleon and meson mass . as a major result",
    "it was found in ref.@xcite that already the well - known tree - level ( pseudoscalar and vector ) meson exchange diagrams lead to predictions for the constant threshold amplitudes which agree with the corresponding experimental values within a few percent .",
    "it also turned out that the short range ( @xmath23 and @xmath6 ) vector meson exchange dominates over the long range ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) pseudoscalar meson exchange for the processes @xmath26 at threshold .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a similar analysis for the kaon production channel @xmath13 . after defining the threshold t - matrix for @xmath13 in terms of a singlet ( @xmath4 ) and a triplet ( @xmath5 ) transition amplitude and implementing the @xmath1 s - wave final state interaction in effective range approximation ,",
    "we extract from the cosy data an experimental value for the combination @xmath27 @xmath3 .",
    "next we perform a relativistic feynman diagram calculation of various vector meson ( @xmath28 ) and pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath29 ) exchange diagrams with vertices given by a su(3 ) symmetric ( chiral ) meson - baryon lagrangian .",
    "we first evaluate these tree diagrams straightforwardly from the relativistic su(3 ) lagrangian not introducing ad hoc meson - nucleon form factors .",
    "the latter are a model - dependent and unobservable concept to account in some sense for the finite size of the hadrons involved .",
    "it is found that pointlike @xmath6-exchange alone with coupling constants given by su(3 ) symmetry can well reproduce the experimental value of @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "the total ( @xmath31 ) vector meson exchange leads to @xmath32 @xmath3 which is about 20% too large . taking into account that possible su(3 ) breaking effects and the uncertainty of the vector meson baryon coupling",
    "constant are of similar size , one can argue that the ( pointlike ) total vector meson exchange is still capable to explain the experimental value @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "the pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath33 exchange diagrams with vertices given by the next - to - leading order su(3 ) chiral lagrangian give rise to rather large individual contributions .",
    "there is a tendency for cancelation between different types of diagrams , but with the su(3 ) chiral meson - baryon vertices the effect is not pronounced enough .",
    "interestingly , the ( pointlike ) @xmath34-exchange alone leads to @xmath35 @xmath3 and if one omits the @xmath9-exchange one obtains @xmath36 @xmath3 from the remaining ( @xmath37)-exchange diagrams .",
    "it therefore seems that the transition amplitude for @xmath38 as given by the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian is not realistic .",
    "this is also underlined by the work of ref.@xcite in which these chiral amplitudes have been iterated to infinite orders via a coupled channel lippmann - schwinger equation and this way a good simultaneous fit of all available low energy data for pion ( and photon ) induced @xmath39-production could be found .",
    "we follow here refs.@xcite and add a @xmath9-exchange diagram involving the resonant @xmath40 transition .",
    "we assume the transition strength to be such that this process alone reproduces the near threshold data for @xmath13 .",
    "if we furthermore introduce at each meson - baryon vertex a monopole form factor with a cutoff @xmath41 gev we finally end up with a total sum of the @xmath17-excitation graph and the vector and pseudoscalar meson exchange diagrams which again is in good agreement with the experimental value @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "it becomes also clear from our analysis that the unpolarized total cross section data for @xmath0 do not provide enough information to distinguish different production mechanisms .",
    "in essence the information given by the total cross section data can be condensed into a single number , namely @xmath2 @xmath3 . as we have demonstrated here",
    ", one can find various subprocesses ( as e.g. the vector meson exchange , the @xmath34-exchange or the @xmath17-excitation focussed on in ref.@xcite ) which alone can reproduce this value .",
    "more exclusive measurements of angular distributions and polarization observables for which one does not average out the kinematical complexity of the process @xmath16 due to spin and the three - particle final state are needed .",
    "such measurements have been started @xcite and we expect more data to come from cosy in the near future .",
    "the t - matrix for kaon and lambda - hyperon production in proton - proton collisions , @xmath42 , at threshold in the center - of - mass frame reads , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the proton center - of - mass momentum with @xmath45 mev at threshold .",
    "the spin - operator @xmath46 is understood to be sandwiched between the spin - states of the ingoing proton @xmath47 and the outgoing proton , while @xmath48 acts between the proton @xmath49 and the outgoing lambda .",
    "the ( complex ) amplitude @xmath4 belongs to the singlet transition @xmath50 @xmath51 and the amplitude @xmath5 belongs to the triplet transition @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "the factor @xmath54 was taken out for convenience since it appears naturally in a calculation employing su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we follow now the successful approach to pion and eta production of ref.@xcite and assume the t - matrix to be constant in the near threshold region and the energy dependence of the total cross section to be given by the three - body phase space and the ( on - shell ) @xmath1 s - wave final state interaction . since the outgoing proton and lambda have small relative momentum one treat their s - wave interaction in effective range approximation , i.e. in terms of the singlet and triplet @xmath1 scattering lengths and the singlet and triplet @xmath1 effective range parameters . experimental evidence",
    "@xcite and model calculations @xcite suggest that these are rather similar for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath1-states . in this case",
    "the unpolarized total cross section for @xmath57 including the @xmath1 s - wave final state interaction reads , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the center - of - mass excess energy . @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the proton , lambda and ( charged ) kaon mass .",
    "@xmath62 is the @xmath1 invariant mass with values between @xmath63 and the kinematical endpoint @xmath64 , and @xmath65 denotes the kllen or triangle function .",

    "a best fit of the seven cosy data points near threshold @xcite leads to the following experimental value of the combination @xmath70    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ tab.1 : total cross sections for @xmath13 . the data are taken from ref.@xcite and the fit is described in the text .",

    "the resulting fit values of @xmath73 are given in tab.1 and the energy dependent total cross section is shown in fig.1 for excess energies @xmath74 mev .",
    "note that the best fit values at the two lowest energies @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 mev lie somewhat outside the experimental error band .",
    "this may be due to the neglect of the @xmath77 coulomb interaction .",
    "a similar slight overestimation of the data points closest to threshold was also observed in ref.@xcite for the reaction @xmath78 .",
    "compared to the processes @xmath79 studied in ref.@xcite the @xmath1 final state interaction plays here a much less important role .",
    "this is also visible from fig.1 which shows that the data follow already approximately the pure three - body phase space behavior , i.e. @xmath80 .",
    "recently , three additional data points near threshold have been measured at cosy @xcite : @xmath81nb , @xmath82nb and @xmath83nb .",
    "these values are well reproduced by the present fit which predicts : @xmath84nb , @xmath85nb and @xmath86nb , respectively .",
    "we note aside that the two data points at higher excess energies @xmath87b and @xmath88b @xcite come out according to eq.(2 ) as @xmath89b and @xmath90b .",
    "the good agreement for @xmath91 mev should be regarded as accidental , since the same experiment @xcite has measured a negative @xmath92 recoil polarization , which can only result from s- and p - wave interference terms .",
    "in this section we will present an exploratory calculation of various vector and pseudoscalar meson exchange diagrams contributing to the threshold amplitudes @xmath93 defined in eq.(1 ) .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the pointlike @xmath34-exchange alone eqs.(12,15 ) gives @xmath159 @xmath3 and if one omits the @xmath9-exchange eqs.(11,14 ) one obtains from the remaining contributions @xmath160 @xmath3 .",
    "both these numbers are close to the experimental value @xmath30 @xmath3 .",

    "instead of performing a similar coupled channel calculation we follow here refs.@xcite and add a further @xmath9-exchange diagram involving the resonant @xmath163 transition . as argued in ref.@xcite we assume the corresponding transition strength to be so large that this process alone can reproduce the near threshold data for @xmath69 . in this case one",
    "has the following contribution from @xmath17-excitation to the triplet and singlet threshold amplitudes , @xmath164 we have convinced ourselves that the direct evaluation of the @xmath17-excitation graph leads to values of similar size taking into account the empirical ranges of the @xmath17-resonance mass and partial decay widths into @xmath115 and @xmath165 .",
    "let us furthermore introduce a monopole form factor at each ( off - shell ) meson - baryon vertex with a cut - off @xmath41 gev .",
    "such values of the cut - off @xmath166 are typically used in one - boson exchange models @xcite of the nn - interaction for both the pion- and vector - meson - nucleon vertex .",
    "this modification of the diagrams brings a reduction factor @xmath167 for the vector and pseudoscalar meson exchange graphs .",
    "note that in the case of the @xmath17-resonance contribution the form factor effect is already included in the number given in eq.(17 ) .",
    "summing up all the contributions due to @xmath168-excitation as well pseudoscalar and vector meson exchange ( including the form factor ) one finds @xmath169 @xmath3 and @xmath170 @xmath3 . the resulting value @xmath171 @xmath3 is again in good agreement with the empirical value @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "evidently , the main lesson to be learned from the present exploratory calculation is that there are in fact various subprocesses ( like pointlike vector meson or @xmath34-exchange or the @xmath17-resonance excitation ) which alone can explain the near threshold data for @xmath13 . with reasonable assumptions on the various coupling strengths and the cut - off @xmath166 entering the ( unobservable ) meson - nucleon form factor one finds that also the total sum of many processes is able to reproduce the near threshold data for @xmath13",
    "this is possible because of cancelations between terms of different sign and because of the freedom the to shift strength between the singlet ( @xmath4 ) and triplet ( @xmath5 ) threshold amplitude .",
    "only more exclusive data ( like angular distributions and polarization observables ) can help to distinguish different @xmath13 production mechanisms .",
    "finally , we like to comment on the recently measured process @xmath172 . it was found experimentally @xcite that the corresponding total cross sections near threshold are about a factor 30 smaller than those for @xmath13 ( at equivalent excess energies ) .",
    "@xmath6-meson exchange or @xmath34-exchange might offer an explanation for this suppression via the small su(3)-ratio @xmath173 .",
    "an explicit calculation of the @xmath6-exchange and @xmath34-exchange ( using now @xmath174 mev in eqs.(8,12,15 ) ) gives for the @xmath175-channel values of @xmath176 @xmath3 and @xmath177 @xmath3 , i.e. a suppression factor of about 40 or 20 for the total cross section .",
    "however , such considerations may be too simplistic in the light of possible strong coupled channel effects @xcite between @xmath165- and @xmath178-states .",
