    "the quality of the recommender system is essential to an e - commerce company @xcite . due to the huge data and the uncertainty of user behavior , recommender systems have also attracted much research interests from the academia @xcite .",
    "tapestry @xcite and grouplens @xcite are among the earliest implementations of collaborative filtering based recommender systems .",
    "many content - based filtering methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been developed .",
    "currently , people tend to adopt more sophisticated ensemble methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that aggregate predications of numerous base algorithms .",
    "cold - start recommendation @xcite is a challenging problem in recommender systems .",
    "it refers the situation that a new user or a new item has just entered the system .",
    "researchers have addressed the problem mainly through content - based filtering methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , inspired by granular computing @xcite , granular association rules with four measures have also bee applied to the problem .",
    "an example of such a rule might be  42% young women rate at least 33% adventure movies released in 1990s ; 21% users are young women and 15% movies are adventure ones released in 1990s . \" here 21% , 15% , 42% and 33% are the source coverage , the target coverage , the source confidence , and the target confidence , respectively .",
    "however , the existing rule mining problem requires four thresholds , one for each measure .",
    "consequently , only globally strong rules are reserved , some users may receive many recommendations , and some may receive no recommendation at all .    in this paper , we propose to mine the top - k granular association rules for each user .",
    "first , we define granular association rules with three measures .",
    "an example of such a rule might be  young women rate adventure movies released in 1990s with a probability of 35% ; 21% users are young women and 15% movies are adventure ones released in 1990s . \" here 35% is the confidence of the rule . with the confidence measure , the strength of any two rules can be compared .",
    "in fact , the four measure suit and the three measure suit are appropriate for different situations .",
    "one can not compute the confidence according to the source confidence and the target confidence , or vice versa .",
    "then , we propose an algorithm for training the recommender .",
    "this is done through building connections between source and target granules that satisfy the coverage thresholds .",
    "finally we propose an algorithm to obtain top - k rules which in turn suggest k types of items to each user .",
    "the duplicate recommendation issue may arise in the rule matching process .",
    "for example , we have two rules  young women rate adventure movies released in 1990s with a probability of 35% \" and  young students rate adventure movies released in 1990s with a probability of 38% .",
    "\" if a new user is a young female student , she will match both rules that produce the same recommendation , namely , movies released in 1990s . in this case , we discard the weaker rule , and the confidence will be viewed 38% .",
    "experiments are undertaken on the movielens data set @xcite using our open source software grale @xcite .",
    "we tested different thresholds and different k values with a number of observations .",
    "first , with some appropriate settings , the recommending accuracy is about 29% for the new user problem , compared with only 6.2% for random recommendation .",
    "second , with the increase of k value , the confidence of recommendation decreases smoothly .",
    "third , when the coverage thresholds are lower , the recommender performs better on the training set however worse on the testing set .",
    "this is due to the over - fitting of the recommender . on the other hand , when the coverage thresholds are high , the recommender performs similar on both sets .",
    "therefore , the appropriate setting of granule is essential to the performance of the recommender .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : preliminaries ] reviews some concepts including many - to - many entity - relationship systems , information granules and granular association rules .",
    "then section [ section : train - test ] describes the training and testing of a rule set .",
    "experimental results on the movielens data set are discussed in section [ section : experiments ] .",
    "finally , section [ section : conclusion ] presents some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we review some preliminary knowledge such as many - to - many entity - relationship systems and information granules @xcite . we also propose granular association rules with three measures .      first we revisit the definitions of information systems , binary relations and many - to - many entity relationship systems @xcite .",
    "[ definition : ins ] @xmath0 is an information system , where @xmath1 is the set of all objects , @xmath2 is the set of all attributes , and @xmath3 is the value of @xmath4 on attribute @xmath5 for @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "two information systems are listed in tables [ subtable : user ] and [ subtable : movie ] , respectively . in table",
    "[ subtable : movie ] , 1 indicates _ true _ , and 0 indicates _",
    "[ definition : binary - relation ] let @xmath1 and @xmath8 be two sets of objects .",
    "any @xmath9 is a binary relation from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "an example of binary relation is given by table [ subtable : rates ] , where @xmath10 is the set of users as indicated by table [ subtable : user ] , and @xmath11 is the set of movies as indicated by table [ subtable : movie ] .",
    "a binary relation can be viewed as an information system . however , in order to save space , it is more often stored in the database as a table with two foreign keys .",
    "[ definition : m - m - er ] a many - to - many entity - relationship system ( mmer ) is a 5-tuple @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two information systems , and @xmath9 is a binary relation from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "an example of mmer is given by table [ table : mmer ] .",
    "users and items can be described by information granules @xcite . in an information system",
    ", any @xmath15 induces an equivalence relation @xcite @xmath16 and partitions @xmath10 into a number of disjoint subsets called _ blocks _ or _",
    "granules_. the granule containing @xmath17 is @xmath18    the following definition was employed by yao and deng @xcite .",
    "[ definition : granule ] a granule is a triple @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the name assigned to the granule , @xmath21 is a representation of the granule , and @xmath22 is a set of objects that are instances of the granule .    according to equation ( [ equation : block - contain - x ] )",
    ", @xmath23 determines a granule in an information system .",
    "hence @xmath24 is a natural name to the granule .",
    "@xmath21 can be formalized as the conjunction of respective attribute - value pairs , i.e. , @xmath25 @xmath22 is given by @xmath26    the _ support _ of the granule is the size of @xmath22 divided by the size of the universe , namely , @xmath27    let @xmath17 and @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 consequently , we say that @xmath30 is _ finer _ than @xmath31 , and @xmath31 is _ coarser _ than @xmath30 .",
    "now we discuss the means for connecting users and items .",
    "a _ granular association rule _",
    "@xcite is an implication of the form @xmath32 where @xmath15 and @xmath33 .    before defining evaluation measures ,",
    "let us look at an example granular association rule  young women rate adventure movies released in 1990s with a probability of 35% ; 21% users are young women and 15% movies are adventure ones released in 1990s . \"",
    "here 21% , 15% , and 35% are the source coverage , the target coverage , and the confidence , respectively .    according to equations ( [ equation : intension - granule ] ) and ( [ equation : extension - granule ] ) ,",
    "the set of objects meeting the left - hand side of the granular association rule is @xmath34 while the set of objects meeting the right - hand side of the granular association rule is @xmath35    the _ source coverage _ of @xmath36 is @xmath37 while the _ target coverage _ of @xmath36 is @xmath38    the _ confidence _ of @xmath36 is the probability that a user chooses an item , namely @xmath39    the confidence measure is a new concept of this work .",
    "it enables the comparison of the strength of any two rules .",
    "therefore it is a key concept supporting top - k rule mining .",
    "note that in existing works , the _ source confidence _ and the _ target confidence _ measures were defined .",
    "here we do not revisit their definitions to avoid confusion .",
    "generally , a recommender system should recommend a number of items to each user . in order to make more successful recommendations",
    ", we would like to match each user to granular association rules , and choose strong rules for item suggestion . at the same time",
    ", the number of recommendations might be controlled approximately the same .",
    "therefore we propose to mine top - k granular association rules for each user .",
    "we divide the whole process into the rule set constructing stage and the recommending stage . in the first stage ,",
    "a rule set is constructed as indicated by algorithm [ algorithm : rule - set ] . to store the rule set , we need an array to store @xmath40 , an array to store @xmath41 , and a matrix with size @xmath42 to store confidence of all rules . here",
    "@xmath40 ( @xmath43 ) is the set of all source ( target ) granules satisfying the source ( target ) coverage threshold .    * input * : the training set @xmath12 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . +",
    "* output * : source granules , target granules , and the rule set , all stored in the memory . + * method * : training +    @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ; compute @xmath49 ;    in the second stage , top - k rules are mined for each user .",
    "respective item granules are recommended to the user .",
    "the process is described in algorithm [ algorithm : top - k - rule - recommendation ] .",
    "the algorithm is exhaustive , hence the top - k rules are always obtained for recommendation .    * input * : the testing set @xmath50 . + * output * : recommendation for each object in @xmath51 . +",
    "* method * : recommend +    reserve the higher confidence value ; continue ; @xmath48 ; compare @xmath36 with other rules matching @xmath52 , and reserve top - k recommended granules according to the confidence ; recommend the top - k granules to @xmath52 ;    sometimes two rules matching one user may have the same target granule .",
    "for example , we have two rules  young women rate adventure movies released in 1990s with a probability of 35% \" and  young students rate adventure movies released in 1990s with a probability of 38% . \"",
    "if a new user is a young female student , she will match both rules that produce the same recommendation . to deal with this situation",
    ", we discard the weaker rule , and keep the higher probability , namely 38% for this example . in this way , the top - k rules suggest different target granules . it should be noted further that different target granules may still overlap .",
    "that is natural and we will not try to avoid it .",
    "the performance of the recommender is evaluated mainly by the accuracy of the recommendation .",
    "formally , let the number of recommended items be @xmath53 , and the number of success recommendations be @xmath54 , the accuracy is @xmath55 .",
    "we will compare three training and testing scenarios .    1 .",
    "random recommendation .",
    "there is no training stage .",
    "an item is randomly recommended to a user .",
    "this is a baseline approach since a recommender which is not significantly better than a random one is simply useless . 2 .",
    "testing on the training set .",
    "it is interesting to test the rule set on the training set .",
    "since only attribute values can be employed , the recommending accuracy may not be high .",
    "divide the user set into the training and testing set .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the new user cold - start problem .",
    "4 .   divide the item set into the training and testing set .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the new item cold - start problem .",
    "5 .   divide both the user and the item sets . in this scenario ,",
    "both users and items are new .",
    "hence the problem is very challenging .",
    "in this section , we try to answer the following questions through experimentation .    1 .   what is the performance of the recommender for the new user , new item , and both new cold - start problems ? 2",
    "how does the performance change for different k values ? 3 .   how does the number of recommendations change with respect to the granule size ? 4 .",
    "how does the performance vary for the training / testing sets ? 5 .   how does the performance change for different sampling of the training set ?",
    "we tested granular association rules on the movielens @xcite which is widely used in recommender systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the database schema is as follows .",
    "1 .   user ( , age , gender , occupation ) 2 .",
    "movie ( , release - year , genre ) 3 .   rates ( )    we use the version with 943 users and 1,682 movies .",
    "the data are preprocessed to cope with definition [ definition : m - m - er ] as follows .",
    "the original rate relation contains the rating of movies with 5 scales , while we only consider whether or not a user has rated a movie .",
    "the user age is discretized to 9 intervals as indicated by the data set .",
    "since there are few movies before 1970s and too many movies after 1990 , the release year is discretized to 3 intervals : before 1970s , 1970s-1980s , and 1990s .",
    "the genre is a multi - valued attribute .",
    "therefore we scale it to 18 boolean attributes and deal with it using the approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "we undertake five sets of experiments to answer the questions raised at the beginning of the section one by one .",
    "the settings are as follows : the training set fraction is 0.6 except for fig .",
    "[ figure : fraction ] .",
    "each experiment is repeated 20 times with different sampling of training and testing sets , and the average accuracy is computed .",
    "[ figure : scenarios ] shows the accuracy of the recommender on the new user , new item , and both new scenarios .",
    "we let k = 1 to test the performance of top-1 rule for each user .",
    "the random recommender , which has an accuracy close to 0.062 , is also illustrated for comparison .",
    "the result indicates that the new user problem is easier and respective recommendations are more meaningful .",
    "the both new problem is the hardest since the least information is available .",
    "moreover , the recommender performs better for smaller granules .",
    "[ figure : k ] indicates that with the increase of k , the accuracy of the recommender decreases smoothly .",
    "it also shows that the first recommendation is significantly better than the second recommendation , and so on .",
    "[ figure : granule ] indicates that with the increase of the granule size , the number of recommended items change at certain thresholds .",
    "this is because that there may not exist granules to exactly match certain given size .",
    "[ figure : tvst ] indicates that the accuracy on the training and testing sets have similar trends .",
    "the trend on the different k values is also validated through fig .",
    "[ figure : k ] .",
    "[ figure : fraction ] indicates that with the increase of the training set and the decrease of the testing set , the accuracy on both sets tend to be closer .",
    "in applications , it is much more easier to specify the number of rules than the support threshold .",
    "therefore building recommenders based on top - k granular association rules is quite natural .",
    "experimental results indicate that the appropriate selection of the granule are essential to the performance of the recommender . in the further",
    ", we will design algorithms for large data sets and for effective granule selection .",
