    "( [ eq : systematics ] ) in order to estimate their magnitude and suggest means for their reduction .",
    "we first consider those terms that contribute to the imaginary part of this signal , i.e. those that will add to the @xmath100 term directly .",
    "we expect that the dominant term of this type that must be addressed is a magnetic dipole contribution , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the amplitude of the imaginary component of the harmonic field , @xmath103 .",
    "we note that the boulder experiments were also affected by a magnetic dipole contribution , which they countered by employing counter - propagating laser beams  @xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "the @xmath104 field component was essential to their measurement , while in the scheme addressed here , it is not . to reduce this component to the level of the pnc contribution",
    "requires @xmath105 .",
    "reduction to lower levels than this is , of course , highly desirable . while this will clearly be an experimental challenge , recent progress using high - q traveling - wave optical cavities to produce linearly - polarized light of high purity has been reported  @xcite . the degree",
    "to which this magnetic dipole term is reduced can be determined experimentally by reversing the direction of @xmath58 and repeating the measurement of @xmath97 .",
    "the spatially - varying ac stark shifts present in the boulder measurements will not be a factor in the present scheme .",
    "stray fields can also contribute to the apparent pnc signal through stark - induced terms such as @xmath106 .",
    "we estimate that this effect can be reduced to the 10@xmath107 level by reducing @xmath77 to @xmath93 1 mv / cm and the polarization purity to @xmath108 .",
    "there are , of course , no detectors available to measure field strengths at these low levels ; for this the methods described by wood  @xcite for nulling stray fields in their measurements should be applicable to the present measurements as well .",
    "for example , referring to eq .",
    "( [ eq : systematics ] ) , increasing @xmath74 to elevate the @xmath109 term , allows one to null @xmath77 , at which point signal modulation as a function of @xmath110 is minimized .",
    "other stray field components can be nulled in a similar manner .    to this point , we have discussed stray field contributions that are in - phase with the pnc term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : systematics ] ) .",
    "there are also terms that contribute signal in phase with the @xmath111 term . for two reasons ,",
    "these appear to be of secondary importance , as long as they are constant in time and spatially homogeneous .",
    "first , one can always apply a dc field @xmath86 large enough that @xmath111 is larger than all others by many orders . secondly",
    ", if some of these terms survive , their effect is to shift the apparent zero point of the applied field @xmath86 .",
    "thus these in - phase contributions can be made negligible by measuring @xmath97 over a sufficiently broad range of applied fields .",
    "we conclude that two - pathway coherent control techniques can present a new means for determination of weak interaction amplitudes .",
    "while we focussed our attention on measurement of @xmath112 , the coherent control technique can also be used to measure the amplitude of the m1 transition moment using a different field geometry .",
    "the primary advantage of the present technique is that the phase of the cross term interference signal can be varied by varying the optical phase difference between the laser beams .",
    "while reversing the direction of dc electric fields , dc magnetic fields , or field polarizations can be used as a means of measuring and reducing stray field effects , phase variation for the primary measurements can be implemented through continuous , external , optical means such as a simple delay cell filled with a non - absorbing variable - pressure gas ( argon or nitrogen , for example ) .",
    "a delay cell is attractive in its simplicity and relative immunity from variations in polarization , amplitude , or beam alignment .",
    "the measurement determines the magnitude and sign of @xmath113 relative to @xmath18 , whose calculated value is more reliable than that of @xmath19 .",
    "precise calibration of the two - photon amplitude is _ not _ required , since we are only interested in the relative variation in the modulation amplitude vs. @xmath86 .",
    "our proposed measurements employ exclusively linear polarizations , a further simplification .",
    "finally , this technique can allow reduction of magnetic dipole contributions without introducing standing - wave optical fields .",
    "experimental efforts leading toward these measurements are currently underway in our laboratory ."
