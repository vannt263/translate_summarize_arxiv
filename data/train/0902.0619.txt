    "studies of clusters and groups of galaxies have revealed an interesting class of objects  relaxed , x - ray bright systems , dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy at the center .",
    "these systems are usually called `` fossil groups ''  @xcite , or , if massive enough , `` fossil clusters ''  @xcite",
    ". the interesting properties of these systems are attributed to their dynamical history , including a lack of galaxy mergers for a long time prior to observation .",
    "because of their quiescent state , fossil groups and clusters ( hereafter fgs ) are `` frozen in time '' as compared to other systems . in x - ray observations fgs appear relaxed , without any obvious sign of recent merging processes .",
    "the number of known fgs is very small , and only a handful of them have been studied in some detail .",
    "known fgs are massive systems with masses in the range typical for rich groups or for poor clusters of galaxies ; they share several scaling relations with other groups and clusters  @xcite .",
    "their central galaxies have properties very similar to those of the brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "the merger histories underlying the origin of the central galaxies in fgs continues to be discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite for different points of view ) .",
    "the definition of fossil groups and clusters remains somewhat ambiguous , as different researchers use somewhat different criteria to identify these systems .",
    "additionally , systems of a possibly `` fossil '' nature have been called overluminous elliptical galaxies ( olegs ,  @xcite ) , or isolated overluminous elliptical galaxies ( iolegs ,  @xcite ) .",
    "even if the nomenclature differs , all these objects are in essence gravitationally bound groups or clusters of galaxies , with the central elliptical galaxy dominating all others galaxies in the system .    in this work",
    "we loosely follow the definition of fgs as given in  @xcite ( hereafter j03 ) , viz .",
    ", a fossil group is an extended x - ray bright object ( @xmath4 erg  s@xmath2 ) , with @xmath5 for galaxies lying inside half of the virial radius , where @xmath6 is the absolute magnitude difference in the r - filter between the first and second brightest galaxy .",
    "this definition is phenomenological , and it was applied by j03 to identify five such objects .",
    "one obvious deficiency of this definition is that it imposes an artificially sharp @xmath6 threshold ( representing the tail of the schechter function ) , whereas no such sharp boundary can be found in the @xmath6 distribution in clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , for any chosen threshold of @xmath6 there will always be systems very close to the boundary , and their identification would depend on the accuracy of photometric measurements in optical observations . there is a very similar , but perhaps even more difficult , problem associated with the measurement of the virial radius . in practice ,",
    "some researchers prefer instead to consider galaxies within some fixed radius @xcite .",
    "finally , group membership can not be reliably determined for individual galaxies .",
    "still , the j03 criteria have the advantage of being definitive , and remain the the most popular choice for fg identification in observations .",
    "we re - evaluate these criteria as part of our analysis .",
    "in contrast to considering fossil systems as a separate category some researchers speculate that there may be a `` fossil phase '' in the life of many clusters , with an absence of significant mergers for a long time , enough for cluster relaxation  @xcite .",
    "a bright galaxy may consequently fly into the inner cluster part , and the object will now appear to the observer as a normal group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "it is clear that to gain a better understanding of the nature of fgs more of these systems have to be observed , and a comparison of fgs with normal groups or clusters of galaxies should be carried out in a uniform manner , free from selection effects as much as possible .",
    "we aim here to identify new fgs and to compare their properties with those of other systems in the same mass range .    for our search",
    "we use the 400d x - ray survey of galaxy clusters  @xcite .",
    "the advantage in using x - ray surveys is that in this case our selection is based on the presence of an extended x - ray source , indicating that the object is a gravitationally bound system , and not a chance superposition of galaxies .",
    "we can then proceed to identify fgs in the optical band .",
    "the 400d survey provides an excellent database for this work , since almost every cluster has a ccd image in the r - band .",
    "we use different optical data to identify fgs in the 400d survey , but our comparison of fgs with other groups and clusters has been mostly enabled by the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss ) dr6 , providing us with a uniform data set both in the x - ray and in the optical . the survey area as a function of flux is well calibrated , allowing us to put constraints on the fg number density .",
    "( a subcatalog of the 400d survey  the 160d survey  @xcite was previously used to identify olegs . )",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the available data and the methodology underlying our fg search . in sections  [ sec3]-[sec5 ]",
    "we present our results : seven new fgs , constraints on the number density of fgs , and an @xmath7 correlation .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "the appendix contains a detailed description of all individual fossil systems we study in this paper .    in this work we consider luminous systems with x - ray luminosities @xmath1 erg  sec@xmath2 .",
    "masses of these objects , estimated from their x - ray luminosities , correspond to rich groups or poor clusters of galaxies .",
    "we generally refer to these systems as clusters to highlight the fact that we study here the bright and massive end of the distribution of fossil systems .",
    "we plan to study less massive systems in future work .    where we need to assume a cosmology",
    ", we choose a @xmath8cdm model , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the hubble constant , measured in units of 100  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "x - ray luminosities and fluxes are given in the 0.52.0 kev band .",
    "we use r - filter apparent sdss magnitudes , and we employ galactic extinction corrections and transform them to ab systems to compute galaxy luminosities .",
    "the difference of the apparent magnitudes in the r - filter is used in other cases .",
    "our sample is based on the 400d cluster survey catalog  @xcite .",
    "this is a catalog of x - ray selected clusters of galaxies from _ rosat _ pspc high latitude pointing observations .",
    "the area of the sky covered by the survey is 397 square degrees .",
    "it includes clusters with fluxes higher than @xmath12 erg  s@xmath2  @xmath13  242 clusters in total .",
    "approximately a third of the clusters have redshifts higher than @xmath14 .",
    "every object has a measured redshift , x - ray flux , and x - ray luminosity .",
    "most of the objects have ccd r - band images mainly obtained with the russian - turkish 1.5-m telescope in the north and the danish 1.54-m telescope in the south .",
    "the 160d catalog  @xcite  a subcatalog of the 400d catalog  was previously used for the search of fgs  @xcite . in this work",
    "we have decided to use the same selection criteria , i.e. , we select clusters with @xmath0 and @xmath15  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "these cuts provide us with clusters of the same richness ( or higher ) as poor abell clusters , being visible on ccd images as galaxy concentrations ( see  @xcite ) . applying these cuts to the complete 400d catalog yields 75 candidates for our fg search .    in the next step",
    "we visually inspect the optical images of the 75 candidates .",
    "it turns out that many of them do not have optical images of sufficient quality for our purposes .",
    "either their field of view is not large enough to cover the desired circle with radius @xmath16 or the quality of the ccd image does not allow for reliable photometry , or it was originally just a scanned photographic plate ( dss2 ) .",
    "we use archival data from the sdss dr6",
    "@xcite , whenever available .",
    "we have sdss data for 38 clusters from the original sample ; for the remaining clusters , we have to work with lower quality optical information .      in 2003 , nine years after the discovery of the first fossil system by  @xcite and several other detections of fossil systems , j03 proposed the first concrete definition of fgs . since then , this definition has been adopted by most of the community , and new fgs have been detected by various research groups .",
    "a major difficulty from the observational perspective is to ensure that all galaxies belonging to the system have been identified .",
    "for example , rx  j@xmath17 was identified ( j03 ) as an fg and later studied again  @xcite in detail .",
    "it was only recently found  @xcite that this system does not in fact obey the jones criteria : a bright galaxy within half of the virial radius had not been seen in previous exposures , which only covered a fraction of the half - virial radius circle around the central galaxy . as another example , the object rx  j@xmath18 was studied by  @xcite and identified as an oleg .",
    "however , it was found from sdss data  @xcite that a bright galaxy inside half of the virial radius had been missed previously , and therefore the system should not have qualified as an fg .",
    "we discuss these examples to caution the reader that even if a system has been previously identified as an fg , new studies with better data may reveal that the identification is erroneous .",
    "another question concerns the accuracy of the photometry obtained for the galaxy members of the system .",
    "the standard definition of an fg requires @xmath19 , but depending on the observational conditions and the methods used , the galaxy flux measurements for the same object might differ .",
    "we therefore view the optical criteria suggested by j03  @xmath19 within half the virial radius  as guidelines rather than strict requirements .    as a first check for our sample of 75 fg candidates",
    ", we consider the systems previously identified as fgs .",
    "such systems allow us to cross - check our observational results with the analysis carried out by other groups and to re - evaluate the jones criteria .",
    "we find six known fgs present in our sample ( see table  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "they are : cl1159p5531 , cl1340p4017 , cl1416p2315 , cl1552p2013 , cl2114m6800 , and cl2247p0337 .",
    "the first four of these systems have been observed by the sdss and therefore good quality optical data is available .",
    "it is known that sdss magnitudes of bright galaxies may be underestimated due to an overestimation of the background level  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we double - check the photometry for one of the known fgs  cl1159p5531 . in figure",
    "[ fig : photom ] we compare the difference in apparent magnitudes between the brightest and all other galaxies , @xmath20 , lying inside @xmath21 for two different cases . in the left panel",
    "we compare the photometry obtained with sextractor   on the r - filter image measured by the flwo 1.2 m telescope vs. sdss dr6 r - filter photometry . in the right panel",
    "we compare photometry obtained with sextractor on the corrected frame sdss r - filter image ( run 2821 , frame 184 ) again vs. sdss dr6 r - filter photometry .",
    "this figure demonstrates that for this group we do not need to correct the sdss photometry .",
    "we also confirm that the photometry obtained from sextractor on sdss corrected frame images for several other groups also does not need a correction .",
    "therefore , everywhere below we do not apply any corrections to the sdss data .",
    "however , we will establish criteria for our fg search that take into account possible inaccuracies in sdss photometry by which @xmath6 might be underestimated .    in order to identify a system as an fg",
    ", we first have to establish a search radius to identify group members and measure @xmath22 . following the standard definition ,",
    "the search radius should be some fraction of the virial radius . using the cluster x - ray luminosities from the 400d catalog we can easily estimate @xmath21 for every cluster in our sample from  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath21 , measured in kpc , is the radius inside which the mean cluster density is 500 times higher than the critical density of the universe .",
    "@xmath21 can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ r500 ] ) with an uncertainty of approximately 8% .",
    "the relation between @xmath21 and the virial radius is given by @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 covers a slightly larger area than suggested by the jones criteria .",
    "we decide to keep this more conservative limit for our search radius as a starting point .          [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath25  fossil group + @xmath26  due to a poor nfw fit , the luminosity is estimated in these cases as a sum of galaxy luminosities inside a given radius minus the sum of luminosities of background galaxies corrected for the area .",
    "lost light corrections are also applied .",
    "+    * exclude central cd galaxies . * mask regions around bright stars and big foreground galaxies , because the photometry around such objects may be incorrect , and the photometry flags usually do not select these galaxies .",
    "we also do not consider galaxies with sdss spectroscopic redshifts if @xmath27 .",
    "* estimate the lost light due to the selected magnitude threshold .",
    "we subtract the background luminosity function from the cluster luminosity function , where the cluster luminosity function is built for galaxies around the x - ray center within a radius of @xmath28 , and a background function is built for galaxies inside the ring with radii from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "we fit the residual by a schechter function written in the form : @xmath31 the fraction of the lost light is given by : @xmath32 * transform magnitudes of all galaxies inside @xmath30 to luminosities with @xmath33-corrections ( kcorrect v  4.1.4 @xcite ) for cluster redshift . build the light profile by summing luminosities of individual galaxies inside the rings around the cluster center and exclude regions masked in step 2 ) . * fit the light profile by a projected navarro - frenk - white function  @xcite plus constant background .",
    "an example of such a fit is shown in figure  [ fig : nfw ] . * in order to calculate the total cluster luminosity inside a given radius we integrate the nfw fit over the volume , then make corrections for the lost light ( see step 3 ) and add the luminosity of cd galaxies .",
    "the error for the cd luminosities takes into account an underestimation of the measured magnitude due to the sdss background subtraction algorithm .",
    "therefore , we increase the upper luminosity error by the appropriate amount ( see figure  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "our measurements are given in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we show the @xmath34 correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_lr ] , where empty points correspond to fgs .",
    "we find that for a given optical luminosity , the fgs in our sample are not systematically brighter in the x - ray than other clusters . indeed ,",
    "four of the fgs reside on the upper envelope of the correlation , but there are also two fgs ( cl1038p4146 and cl1159p5531 ) which appear x - ray faint compared to other clusters with similar optical luminosity .",
    "we also compare our results with previous studies .",
    "@xcite compared their fgs with other groups of galaxies studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show these data in fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_lr ] .",
    "we also add a compilation of optical luminosity measurements from  @xcite , with optical luminosities rescaled to @xmath21 .",
    "there appears to be general agreement in the trends between the fgs studied here and the fgs studied in @xcite ; their distribution is also in agreement with the overall data for clusters , but not for groups .",
    "it is not clear whether the difference between fgs and other groups reported by  @xcite is real for less massive systems or if it is a result of systematic differences in analysis techniques used in different studies .",
    "we hope to address this issue in future work .",
    "we have analyzed nearby ( @xmath0 ) and x - ray bright ( @xmath35 erg  sec@xmath2 ) clusters of galaxies from the 400d catalog . by evaluating known fgs against sdss data ,",
    "we have formulated slightly revised selection criteria for fossil systems .",
    "our criteria are somewhat relaxed compared to those used by j03 , but their advantages are : 1 ) they select all previously known fgs ( except for one system clearly misidentified as an fg ) , 2 ) they account for the possibility that the photometry of the brightest galaxy may be underestimated and therefore guard against missing any fgs as a consequence .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) we found seven new fgs in the 400d cluster survey .",
    "the images and descriptions of all 400d fgs are given in appendix a.    \\2 ) we put new constraints on the number density of fgs .",
    "our constraints are consistent with ones obtained previously , but are tighter due to the larger number of fgs studied .",
    "\\3 ) we measured optical luminosities of clusters with sdss photometric data",
    ". measurements of @xmath7 correlations for these clusters show that fgs are similar to the overall cluster sample , and follow the scaling relation of clusters of galaxies .",
    "current definitions of fgs are not robust , i.e. , the same object may be identified as an fg or not depending on what magnitude threshold and search radius is chosen . due to the variety of galaxy distributions in cluster potential wells , and due to cluster evolution ,",
    "it is hard to motivate a strict definition of fgs using simple observables .",
    "moreover , there is another major obstacle from the observational perspective for fg searches  the group membership , which can not be firmly established observationally .",
    "while precise redshift measurements can weed out most of the projected galaxies , they are not enough to establish the presence or absence of a gravitational bond between a given galaxy and the group , nor can they provide a measurement of the distance from a given galaxy to the center along the line of sight .",
    "it is evident that the situation is much more complicated if precise redshift measurements are not available .",
    "the absence of such redshift measurements may account for the differences in the number density of fgs found in observations and in simulations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most observational estimates for the number density of fgs most likely represent a lower limit for the actual number .    due to the small number of known fgs it is too early to draw final conclusions about their properties . any new fg candidate must be examined thoroughly .",
    "optical selection of fgs is possible , but complicated  @xcite .",
    "dedicated x - ray observations would be very useful to continue studies of unusual properties of fgs .",
    "this work was supported by the ldrd program at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "data from sdss dr6 was used extensively in this study .",
    "the sdss is managed by the astrophysical research consortium for the participating institutions .",
    "the participating institutions are the american museum of natural history , astrophysical institute potsdam , university of basel , university of cambridge , case western reserve university , university of chicago , drexel university , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , johns hopkins university , the joint institute for nuclear astrophysics , the kavli institute for particle astrophysics and cosmology , the korean scientist group , the chinese academy of sciences ( lamost ) , los alamos national laboratory , the max - planck - institute for astronomy ( mpia ) , the max - planck - institute for astrophysics ( mpa ) , new mexico state university , ohio state university , university of pittsburgh , university of portsmouth , princeton university , the united states naval observatory , and the university of washington .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions regarding sdss photometry with chris miller and adrian pope . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
