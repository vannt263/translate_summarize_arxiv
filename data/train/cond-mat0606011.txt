    "the process of phase separation in chemically reactive mixtures has been considered by several authors .",
    "et al _ @xcite and christensen _ et al _",
    "@xcite used a modification of the cahn - hilliard equation to investigate the effects of a linear reaction of the type @xmath0 occurring simultaneously with phase separation following an instantaneous quench .",
    "in contrast to phase separation alone , domain coarsening was halted at a length - scale dependent on system parameters resulting in the ` freezing in ' of a spatially heterogeneous pattern .",
    "it was recognized that the steady - states resulted from competition between the demixing effects of phase separation and the equivalence of the chemical reaction term to an effective long - range repulsion @xcite .",
    "similar physics is seen in the phase ordering of block copolymers where an effective long - range interaction arises because of an interplay between interactions and steric constraints @xcite .",
    "in such systems pattern formation is a result of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , in the systems we consider , the steady - states are maintained dynamically by the interplay of reaction and diffusion .",
    "a number of chemically and structurally more complicated systems have been considered , numerically and theoretically , within the same framework of a modified cahn - hilliard equation .",
    "these include ternary mixtures @xcite and systems with orientational order @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on phase ordering in a binary fluid mixture with chemical reactions using a lattice boltzmann method . the case of the linear reaction",
    "has been considered before by hou _",
    "et al _ @xcite by a different numerical method .",
    "we duplicate some of their results as a means of testing our approach and then consider the quadratic reaction mechanism @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of hydrodynamics is known to strongly affect the way in which an unreactive fluid mixture coarsens in the aftermath of a quench @xcite .",
    "the growth exponent is found to increase from @xmath2 , for the purely diffusive case , to @xmath3 or @xmath4 for the viscous and inertial hydrodynamic regimes respectively . the new pathway for growth provided by hydrodynamics is transport of the bulk fluid down a pressure gradient established by variations in curvature @xcite . in two dimensions this minimises curvature by making domains circular , whereupon the effect vanishes and further coarsening can only occur by diffusion @xcite .",
    "in addition there is the possibility , investigated by tanaka @xcite , that the rapid decrease in interfacial area resulting from the hydrodynamic mechanism may leave the bulk phases unequilibrated and subject to a round of secondary phase separations .",
    "this suggests that coupling a modified cahn - hilliard equation to the navier - stokes equations for fluid flow may uncover behaviour different to that observed for the purely diffusive case .",
    "experimental work @xcite-@xcite has shown that a variety of mesoscopic structures can be formed when chemical reactions are photo - induced in phase separating polymer mixtures .",
    "the effects of two kinds of photo - chemistry have been considered : intermolecular photodimerisations @xcite and intramolecular photoisomerisation @xcite .",
    "both give rise to a long - range inhibition which prevents phase separation proceeding beyond a certain domain size . in the first case",
    "the inhibition is due to the formation of a network of cross - linked polymer molecules whereas in the second case it arises from the differing chemical properties of the two isomers .",
    "the similarities in the patterns formed due to phase separation arrest in simple fluids and in reactive polymer blends suggest the latter may be approached by considering first a small - molecule system .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : modelsection ] we present a model of a chemically reactive binary fluid which couples the processes of reaction and diffusion to flow .",
    "we then outline the linear theory of pattern formation in the absence of hydrodynamic effects . in section  [ sec : latticeboltzmethod ] we construct a lattice boltzmann scheme which solves the equations of motion of section  [ sec : modelsection ] in the continuum limit . in sections  [ sec :",
    "linearreact ] and [ sec : quadreact ] results are presented for the evolution of both high and low viscosity systems after a critical quench for a linear and a quadratic reaction mechanism respectively . for the reaction of type @xmath0 , comparison is made with the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we summarize a model which describes the phase behavior and hydrodynamics of a two - component fluid . labeling the components @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", we choose a description of the fluid in terms of the following variables : the total density , @xmath7 ; the total momentum , @xmath8 , and a compositional order - parameter , @xmath9 .",
    "the composition of the fluid evolves according to a modified version of the cahn - hilliard equation which includes the effects of chemical reaction ; advection of the order - parameter by the flow - field , * u * , and diffusion in response to gradients in chemical potential : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a mobility constant and @xmath12 , which depends on the reaction rate constants , is the change in @xmath13 per unit time due to chemical reactions .",
    "the chemical potential of the system , @xmath14 , is given by the functional derivative of the free energy , @xmath15 , with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "we choose a free energy @xmath16(t ) = \\int d{\\bf x}\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\phi^{2}+\\frac{\\gamma}{4}\\phi^{4}+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^{2 } + t\\rho\\ln~\\rho \\right).\\ ] ] @xmath17 is taken to be greater than zero for stability and the sign of @xmath18 determines whether the polynomial contribution to the free - energy density has one or two minima , and hence whether the fluid is above ( @xmath19 ) or below ( @xmath20 ) its critical temperature . for @xmath20",
    "the mixture will separate into two bulk components separated by a narrow , but smooth , interface .",
    "the gradient - squared term in @xmath13 associates an energy cost with variations in composition and the parameter @xmath21 is related to the surface tension and governs the width of the interface between the two phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 appears in the isotropic part of the pressure tensor and is related to the degree of incompressibility of the fluid @xcite .",
    "a suitable choice is @xmath23 .",
    "we consider two types of reactive source term , @xmath12 . a linear source @xmath24   =   \\rho ( \\gamma_{2 } - \\gamma_{1 } ) - \\phi ( \\gamma_{1 } + \\gamma_{2}),\\ ] ] corresponding to the reversible chemical reaction @xmath25 . and a quadratic source @xmath26   = \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\gamma_{1 } + \\gamma_{2 } ) ( \\phi - \\rho ) \\left ( \\phi - \\frac{(\\gamma_{2}-\\gamma_{1})\\rho}{\\gamma_{1 } + \\gamma_{2 } } \\right),\\ ] ] corresponding to the reversible chemical reaction @xmath1 .",
    "the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the rates of the forward and backward reactions respectively .",
    "we note that , for a spatially homogeneous system , the linear mechanism has a single stable fixed point whereas the quadratic mechanism has a stable fixed point at @xmath29 and an unstable one at @xmath30 . here",
    "we consider only cases where @xmath31 .",
    "the velocity field obeys a navier - stokes equation , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pressure tensor , @xmath34 is the viscosity and @xmath35 is the viscous stress tensor .",
    "the pressure tensor is derived from the free - energy : @xmath36 this provides a further coupling between the evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath37 in addition to the advection term in ( [ eq : rda ] ) . from ( [ eq : pressurerelation ] ) and ( [ eq : freeenergy ] ) it follows that @xmath38 \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } + \\kappa \\partial_{\\alpha}{\\phi } \\partial_{\\beta}{\\phi},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the polynomial contribution to the free - energy density .",
    "the total mass density of the fluid @xmath40 is also conserved and obeys @xmath41      linear stability analysis of the reaction - diffusion equation ( [ eq : rda ] ) with @xmath42 and source term ( [ eq : linearsource ] ) shows that only those modes , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 are unstable , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 depend on the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath11 in equation ( [ eq : rda ] ) @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to spinodal decomposition ( the case @xmath47 ) where only short - wavelength modes are stable .",
    "the damping of long - wavelength modes in the reactive case prevents continued growth of domains .",
    "instead , phase separation is halted at some length - scale set by the reaction .",
    "in addition , there is a threshold value of @xmath48 , @xmath49 above which the reaction is strong enough to completely inhibit phase separation by rendering all linear modes stable .",
    "we also note , following @xcite and @xcite , that there is an equivalence between this behaviour and phase ordering in a system with competing short and long - range interactions .",
    "the equivalence can be demonstrated by incorporating the reactive source into an effective free - energy for the system where it appears as a non - local term .",
    "formally , we rewrite ( 1 ) as @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the green s function of the laplace operator .",
    "the reaction is then seen to act as an effective long - range , intra - species repulsion , with strength governed by @xmath48 , in contrast to the short - range attraction of like - molecules which drives phase separation .    for the case of equal forward and backward rates ,",
    "the linearised behaviour of the quadratic source ( [ eq : quadsource ] ) with reaction rate @xmath48 is the same as for the linear source with reaction rate @xmath53 .",
    "this can be seen from the linearisation of ( [ eq : rda ] ) with @xmath54 and source term ( [ eq : quadsource ] ) .",
    "hence , at early times , the linear and quadratic cases segregate in the same way .",
    "however , after the formation of separate a and b - rich regions , non - linear contributions to the source term become important and this is expected to lead to growth of the a - rich phases at the expense of the b - rich ones .",
    "this follows from the asymmetry of @xmath12 between the two phases : in the a - rich phase the production of b is limited by the amount of b already present .",
    "hence it is limited by the _ minority _ component of the fluid in these regions . in the b - rich regions",
    "the production of a is limited by the amount of the majority phase present .",
    "therefore production of a in the b - rich phase is the more rapid process .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method is a well - established numerical technique for hydrodynamic problems @xcite .",
    "initially it was a kinetic - theory based method for the simulation of isothermal ideal flows which was introduced to circumvent some of the problems which rendered its predecessor , lattice - gas cellular automata , impractical .",
    "however , it has since been modified and applied to a variety of problems in the simulation of complex fluids .",
    "examples include binary fluids @xcite , liquid - gas systems @xcite , liquid - crystals @xcite and colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "a lattice boltzmann scheme for the simulation of two or more species undergoing reaction and diffusion in a moving , viscous solvent was formulated by dawson _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in comparision , our model incorporates the thermodynamics of the multi - component fluid via the cahn - hilliard equation .    to simulate the binary fluid model described in section  [ sec : modelsection ] we utilise the free - energy lattice boltzmann method of swift _ et al _ @xcite . to this end",

    "moreover , @xmath103 is no longer monotonically increasing : it attains a maximum due to the creation of more interface during secondary phase separation events .",
    "in conclusion , we have extended the lattice boltzmann method to study the effect of hydrodynamics on structures arising in phase - separating reactive mixtures for two simple reaction mechanisms .",
    "we have found that hydrodynamic flow significantly alters both the way in which the domain structure in these fluids evolves and the eventual steady states of the system .",

    "an asymmetric domain structure was obtained , with the inclusion of hydrodynamic effects leading to secondary phase separation within majority phase .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the model to incorporate viscoelastic effects arising from constituent molecules with internal microstructure : one can envisage chemical processes which can change the local microstructural elements .",
