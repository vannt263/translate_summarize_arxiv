    "since the single electron tunneling phenomena were described about 30 years ago @xcite , many devices based on small tunnel junctions have been demonstrated .",
    "an example of such a device is the coulomb blockade thermometer ( cbt ) using one @xcite or two dimensional arrays of tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "cbt based on electron tunneling enables one to relate the measured voltage to temperature with the help of boltzmann constant @xmath0 , which could thus provide a means to revise the definition of kelvin @xcite . a related idea forms the basis of shot - noise thermometry , described in refs .",
    "cbt thermometry is based on the change of electrical conductance @xmath1 of tunnel junction arrays .",
    "typically , cbt works in a weak coulomb blockade regime @xmath2 , where the charging energy of the system with @xmath3 junctions in series is @xmath4e^2/c_{\\sigma}$ ] and @xmath5 is the total capacitance of an island between the junctions that depends on the physical size of the contact and the self capacitance of the island . in this regime ,",
    "cbt sensor works as a primary thermometer , meaning that calibration is not needed @xcite . for a uniform array",
    ", the differential conductance scaled by its asymptotic value @xmath6 at large positive and negative voltages can be written in terms of bias voltage @xmath7 as @xmath8 where the function @xmath9/[8 \\sinh^4(x/2)]$ ] determines the bias dependence .",
    "primary measurements of temperature can be achieved from the measurement of full width of the conductance dip at half minimum @xmath10 thus , obtained temperature does not depend on the geometry or material of a sensor .",
    "a secondary temperature measurement can be obtained by recording the depth of the zero bias conductance dip @xmath11 with parameter @xmath12 . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , at high temperature ( in that case 4.2 k ) the measured conductances follow quite well the expression in eq .  ( [ eq.3 ] ) .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate experimentally the extension of coulomb blockade thermometry into an intermediate temperature regime described theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite . experiments employing quantum dot thermometry @xcite , investigating electrical conduction in metallic nanodots @xcite or granular films @xcite work in this intermediate coulomb blockade regime as well .",
    "the intermediate regime is defined by @xmath13 , between the traditional cbt operation range @xmath2 , and the full coulomb blockade @xmath14 , see fig .",

    "solid black and dash - dotted blue lines correspond to the numerically calculated temperature dependent conductance of cbt at zero bias using theory of single electron tunneling @xcite ( refered to `` full theory '' in the following text ) .",
    "the two limiting cases , `` minimum blockade ''  ( dash - dotted blue line )  and `` maximum blockade '' ( solid black line ) , represent the two opposite extremes of the possible background charge configurations .",
    "thus we compare the two extreme cases to indicate the uncertainty due to the unknown background charge values .",
    "as long as the two curves follow each other , the uncertainty due to background charges can be neglected . in the regime",

    "[ fig:1 ] . to fully tune the background charges in a large array",

    "the harmful contribution of nonlinear i - v curves ( predominantly due to finite tunnel barrier height ) as a function of applied bias voltages is less abundant @xcite .",
    "another motivation of the present work is to expand the temperature range where a single cbt sensor can be used @xcite .    to obtain the temperature with high accuracy , one has to make a series expansion up to higher orders in @xmath17 towards low temperatures @xcite . in this work ,",
