    "akari ( @xcite ) , an infrared space telescope , was launched on february 21 , 2006 ( ut ) and has successfully carried out its missions including all sky surveys at mid to far infrared wavelengths and pointed observations at near to far infared .",
    "the ` cold ' mission lasted until the helium boil out on august 26 , 2007 .",
    "in addition to the all sky surveys , akari has devoted large amount of observational time to cover the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) area since the nep ( and the south ecliptic pole [ sep ] as well ) is the only location in the sky with excellent visibility for polar sun synchronous orbit missions like akari .",
    "the nep survey of akari is composed of two programs : deep ( nep - deep ) and wide ( nep - wide ) surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nep - wide observed a large area ( @xmath4 5.8 sq .",
    "deg . ) , while the nep - deep covered a smaller ( 0.38 sq . deg . )",
    "area with integration times longer than the nep - wide survey by a factor of 3 - 10 .",
    "these two surveys are intended to be mutually complementary .",
    "both nep - wide and nep - deep surveys are done with all the filters of infrared camera ( irc ) covering near to mid infrared wavelengths ( see @xcite , for the description of this instrument ) .",
    "the irc wide bands are designated as n2 , n3 , n4",
    ", s7 , s9w , s11 , l15 , l18w , l24 . the numbers appearing after the roman alphabet represent the approximate effective wavelengths in units of @xmath0 m , while the w s for 9 and 18",
    "@xmath0 m represent the fact that the bandwidths are wider .",
    "prior to the full scale survey of the nep , mini surveys were carried out during the performance verification period in order to check the performance of the instruments as well as survey strategies .",
    "the results of such surveys were already published ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , akari has regularly observed the ` monitor field ' near nep centered at @xmath5 , @xmath6 with all 9 irc bands in order to check the stability of the instruments during the entire period of the nep surveys .",
    "the preliminary analysis of the monitor field data was presented by @xcite .",
    "the nep - wide data set has similar but slightly worse ( by up to 0.6@xmath7 ) sensitivity compared to that of the early data of nep - deep as presented by @xcite who focused on the nature of 11 @xmath0 m selected sources covering around 10@xmath8 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "they found that a majority of sources detected at mir are star forming galaxies located at redshift of 0.2 @xmath9 0.7 .",
    "some of the sources are suspected to be very red objects at much higher redshift .",
    "since the observed area was much smaller than the entire nep - wide , there were only 72 sources with 11 @xmath0 m magnitude brighter than 18.5 . by simple",
    "scaling , we expect to detect around 15,000 sources in the entire nep - wide area with a similar flux limit .",
    "the optical data are very useful in identifying the sources detected by akari since they provide high resolution images .",
    "the optical survey was carried out before the launch of akari covering about 2 sq .",
    "inside nep - wide survey area with the cfht s megaprime wide field camera ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we used the cfht data for the purpose of identification of sources found in the nep - wide survey .",
    "the rest of the nep - wide area was observed by the 1.5 m telescope at maidanak observatory in uzbekistan under very good seeing conditions ( @xmath10 ) with johnson s b , r , and i filters .",
    "the result of the maidanak optical survey will be published elsewhere , but we have utilized both cfht and maidanak data for the purpose of identification of the infrared selected sources .    the purpose of this paper is to present the basic strategies of the nep - wide survey and the properties of the sources found from it .",
    "more detailed analysis of the sources will be postponed to forthcoming papers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe survey strategy , and the data reduction process . in  3 , we present the characteristics , and nature of the detected sources .",
    "we then present the number count band in  5 and summarize our results in the final section .",
    "the large area of @xmath1 5 sq . deg . of the nep - wide survey was required to avoid uncertainty of cosmic variance in the universe at @xmath11 , to search for the large - scale fluctuations of the cosmic near infrared background , and to obtain a large sample of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies . in order to cover such a large area with small fov ( 10@xmath1210 ) of irc for extragalactic study ,",
    "nep is the most suitable area because another high visibility area of south eclipic pole ( sep ) region lies very close to the large magellanic cloud and the visibility is not sufficiently high at any other places .",
    "there were strong constraints on making a large area map using irc .",
    "first , the fovs of the mir - l ( long wavelengths of mir ) channel is separated by approximately 20  from that of the nir and mir - s ( short wavelength of mir ) channels of akari / irc , although the three channels take images simultaneously .",
    "second , the position angle of irc fovs depends on the date of the observation because the sun - shield of the akari satellite always has to point to the sun and thus the focal plane instruments are aligned along ecliptic coordinates . given these constraints , to maximize the survey efficiency toward the nep we planned to make seven concentric circles ( and one additional in some quadrants ) centered on nep with the fovs of all irc channels .",
    "the survey was scheduled to be completed within a year ( see fig .",
    "[ survey - map ] ) . also shown in this figure",
    "are the nep - deep exposure map indicated by red boxes as well as the optical survey area of cfht as yellow boxes . for the observational redundancy , an observation on a circle",
    "was planned to be shifted with half of fovs of neighboring observations , so that any area would be observed at least twice .",
    "each pointing observation was done by the ` irc03 ' template .",
    "this observing mode was designed for general purpose imaging observations that take images with three filters in a pointed observation . for each filter two imaging observations",
    "are made with dithering operations .",
    "the detailed observational procedure for each astronomical observation template ( aot ) is described in akari irc data user manual ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were carried out as planned as long as the schedule permits .",
    "the nep - wide survey was completed with 446 pointing observations .",
    "( 95mm,95mm)figure01.ps",
    "the observed data were processed using irc data reduction pipeline version 071017 .",
    "the pipeline subtracts the dark current , normalizes the signal , corrects for the linearity , and applies the flat field corrections .",
    "the cosmic rays are removed in the pipeline for the mir images ( s7 , s9w , s11 , l15 and l18w ) during the image stacking process because these images are taken with multiple exposures per pointing .",
    "however , the number of exposures for nir bands was smaller than that of mir bands , and therefore the cosmic rays have not been completely removed during the stacking of multiply exposed images .",
    "especially , there are only two frames to be stacked in most of the n4 data so that the majority of cosmic rays remain unremoved . in such cases ,",
    "we have applied a program l.a.cosmic ( @xcite ) which employs laplacian edge detection algorithm .",
    "the cosmic ray removal for n4 band image data heavily relied on l.a.cosmic task which often makes somewhat erroneous corrections for the cosmic ray effects .",
    "therefore we should take the n4 band photometric data with more care than those of other wavelengths .",
    "we applied l.a.cosmic for n2 and n3 as well .",
    "for these data , large fraction of cosmic rays can be removed during the stacking process .    finally the astrometric information is added .",
    "the astrometric solution can be found nearly automatically for n2 , n3 , n4 , s7 and s9w images by comparing with the 2mass database . however , the mid - infrared band frames for s11 to l24 contain relatively smaller numbers of sources so that often automatic astrometric solution can not be derived . in such cases ,",
    "we have used imaging data with astrometric solutions at shorter wavelengths in order to obtain the accurate positional information for next longer wavelength images ( i.e. , s9w for s11 , etc ) .",
    "this procedure provides reasonable results up to l18w images for most exposures .",
    "however , the procedure was successful for only 239 frames out of 446 for l24 band due to a small number of identifiable sources . because of such a poor astrometric calibration we do not present the analysis of the l24 band data in this study .",
    "we will report the result for l24 band in forthcoming papers .",
    "after the astrometric solutions are settled for individual pointing data , we mosaicked them to produce a single master image of entire survey region for each passband using swarp software package by e. bertin at terafix ( see http://terapix.iap.fr/img/pdf/swarp.pdf for the detailed description of this software ) . the procedure to obtain photometric data",
    "is described in next subsection .",
    "note that magnitude system referred henceforth is ab magnitude .",
    "in order to check the quality of the mosaic images , we have measured the fwhm of bright point sources in mosaic images and listed the results in table [ psf ] , together with single frame fwhms taken from irc data user manual ( @xcite ) . in the case of nir bands ,",
    "the mosaic images have about 30% larger fwhm than single frame values while the degradations in s and l bands are much smaller . the degradation in nir band",
    "is mostly due to the elongated shape of psfs in nir bands .",
    ".full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in units of pixel ( and in arcseconds in the parenthesis ) of the point spread function [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the number of sources detected in individual filters vary significantly .",
    "there are much more sources in near infrared than mid infrared .",
    "for example , there are about 104,000 sources in n3 band while about 14,500 sources are detected in s7 .      in order to check the accuracy of our astrometric solutions , we compared the positional data of akari s point sources that are brighter than 19-th magnitude in n2 and 18-th magnitude in s11 , with the counterpart sources in cfht data .",
    "for this purposes , we matched our source list with that of the cfht data base by @xcite .",
    "the matching radius was chosen to be 3.5 arcseconds and the number of matched sources was about 2000 . the astrometric comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ astrometry ] .",
    "we found that there is an offset of @xmath13 and @xmath14 between cfht and nep - wide astrometric solutions ( akari - cfht ) .",
    "this offset is known to exist when cfht data were compared with guide star catalogue ( gsc , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ rms _ deviations shown in the figure is about 1.38@xmath15 which is about 30% of the fwhm of the single frame psf of the nir bands .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)figure04.ps      in order to check the accuracy of our photometry , we compared our catalogue with that of nep - deep field by wada et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in fig .",
    "the nep - deep field lies within the nep - wide survey area as shown in fig .",
    "we found that the scatter is becomes larger at fainter magnitudes , and there exist small but non - negligible difference ( order of 0.02 - 0.06 magnitudes ) between nep - wide and nep - deep in the sense that nep - wide is slightly fainter when checked with the monitor field data by takagi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we found opposite tendency , although the difference is also very small .",
    "the systematic difference may have resulted from the different photometry parameters .",
    "the small differences of @xmath16 magnitude would not affect our conclusions of the present work of characterization of the data and source .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)figure05a.ps ( 90mm,100mm)figure05b.ps",
    "the sources detected in our survey ranges from various galactic objects to distant galaxies and quasars .",
    "although it is not easy to identify the nature of all the sources using the akari data alone , we try to categorize them based on our photometric data and optical survey data .",
    "it is worth noting that the previous study by @xcite for the early data of nep - deep showed that the majority of the s11 flux limited sample are star forming galaxies while less than 20% of the detected sources are found to be stars .",
    "since the nep - wide survey has a sensitivity similar to that of the sample discussed in @xcite , we also expect a large fraction of the mid - infrared selected sample to be star forming galaxies .    in order to distinguish objects with different natures",
    ", we generated color - magnitude ( cm ) and color - color ( cc ) diagrams for the sources that are matched with the cfht point sources . in fig .",
    "[ cm1 ] , we show the cm diagrams of nep - wide sources with s11 brighter than 18.5 magnitude .",
    "the red dots represent the sources whose stellarity parameters ( @xmath17 ) are greater than 0.8 in the cfht @xmath18-band image and @xmath18 magnitude brighter than 19 .",
    "these sources are thought to be mostly stars , and we have confirmed that the optical - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these objects indeed closely follow that of black - body , assuring that these are stars .",
    "as expected from the black body nature of stellar seds , the star - like sources have nir colors lying in rather narrow ranges in n2-n4 and n3-n4 .",
    "the number of sources with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are 780 while total s11 flux limited sample within the cfht survey field is 3800 .",
    "this means that the stellar fraction is about 20% for a sample with @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath18 brightness cut was applied to avoid possible contamination by faint galaxies .",
    "this can be compared with the previous study by @xcite who found that the stellar fraction is about 18% of the 72 s11 flux limited sample after careful examination of optical to mir seds as well as the optical images .",
    "thus our criteria of @xmath20 for bright optical sources can detect all the stars and could possibly include some distant compact galaxies .",
    "also shown in these cm diagrams are the tracks of star forming galaxies represented by m82 ( violet lines ) and m51 ( blue lines ) seds .",
    "we have taken the template seds of these star forming galaxies from @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are taken as typical examples of different star formation rates ( sfr ) : m51 for low sfr and m82 for moderate sfr galaxies .",
    "although the rest frame near infrared color depends on the star formation rate significantly , the tracks converge into nearly identical lines at redshifts greater than 0.5 .",
    "since we assumed the luminosity to be @xmath22 , the tracks of galaxies with different luminosities would slide horizontally from the lines shown in this figure so that the sources at lower right corner can also be explained by fainter star forming galaxies lying at moderate redshifts ( @xmath23 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ cc1 ] , we show near and mid infrared cc diagrams .",
    "the red dots are the ` stellar sources ' as defined by the stellarity parameter for bright optical sources .",
    "as expected from the narrow ranges in n2-n3 and n3-n4 colors , majority of the stellar sources lie in a small blue box shown in the upper panel",
    ". the tracks of star forming galaxies are also shown in these cc diagrams .",
    "here we have added arp 220 which is a typical example of starburst galaxy .",
    "while the tracks are highly degenerated in the nir cc diagram in the upper panel , the mir - nir cc diagram shown in the lower panel is more sensitive to the star formation rates as well as the redshifts . for the galaxies with very high star formation rates ( e.g. , arp 220 ) ,",
    "rest frame s7-s11 color is very blue because of very strong 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature .",
    "however as this pah feature redshifts to 11 @xmath0 m band , the tendency of the color is reversed . as seen in the lower panel of the fig .",
    "[ cc1 ] , redder part of the s7-s11 color is occupied by the galaxies with higher star formation rate located at ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)figure06.ps    ( 90mm,100mm)figure07.ps    ( 90mm,100mm)figure08.ps    in fig . [ cc2 ] ,",
    "we have shown two more cc diagrams with mir ( s7-s11 or l15-l18w ) and nir colors ( n2-n4 ) .",

    "the tracks of three types of star forming galaxies represented by m51 , m82 and arp 220 .",
    "again we find that the nep sources occupy large area in these cc diagrams .",
    "when compared with the tracks of various types of star forming galaxies , we find that majority of nep sources are star forming galaxies within moderate redshifts",
    ". however , we also notice that many sources fall on some parts of cc plane which can not be occupied by star forming galaxies such as lower left part and lower right of the n2-n4 versus l15-l18w cc diagram .",
    "also the rare objects with very red n2-n4 color are likely to be agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "the range of l15-l18w color range of the nep - wide sources appears to be much wider than typical star forming galaxies . unlike s7-s11 , l15-l18w",
    "color does not seem to be an indicator of sfr .",
    "clearly more careful study is needed to identify the nature of the sources found in the nep - wide survey .",
    "we attempted to identify mir sources among the radio emitting objects from the nrao / vla sky survey ( nvss ) data ( condon , et al .",
    "1998 ) . out of about 260 radio sources brighter than 2.5 mjy at 1.4 ghz ( 21 cm ) in nep - wide area",
    ", we found 30 sources that match with the mir source at 15 @xmath0 m . in fig .",
    "[ radio ] we show the optical - mir sed plots of the 11 sources which have optical counterparts in cfht or maidanak data .",
    "the radio flux is shown as a blue dot in the righthand side of each plot .",
    "although there appears no clear correlation between mir and radio fluxes , we found that the large fraction of the radio sources with mir counterparts are suspected to be agns .",
    "for example , 4 out of 11 ( @xmath24% ) sources show power - law seds ( j180900.83 + 670425.0 , j180034.67 + 673615.9 , j175104.17 + 660649.5 and j175204.17 + 660649.5 ) , indicating they are indeed agns .",
    "this can be compared with the finding by lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that only 6% of the mir selected sources are agns .",
    "the remaining 7 sources which show nir bumps need more careful examination since some of them could also be agns having large amount of late type stars .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)figure09.ps",
    "it is important to distinguish between stellar and extended sources for further analysis . as we saw in the comparison with the nep - early data , almost all the sources with stellarity @xmath20 are likely to be stars .",
    "we estimated the fraction of stars among the mid - indrared sources by using the cfht data .",
    "we identified the sources as stars when the mid - infrared sources have optical counterparts in the cfht field .",
    "the ` stellar fractions ' determined in this way in s9w , s11 , l15 and l18w band sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ star_frac ] as a function of magnitude .",
    "the size of the magnitude bin was 0.5 mag . in s9w and s11 ,",
    "the stellar fraction is very large for bright sources and decreases rapidly toward the fainter ends .",
    "however , the stellar fraction of the sources detected in l15 and l18w are much smaller than that of s11 , and it decreases rather slowly toward the fainter parts .",
    "there is virtually no sources with high stellarity among faint sources .",
    "one of the powerful ways for the study of the evolution of galaxies is to examine the distribution of sources as a function of flux . we know that the source counts flatten at faint flux but the magnitude of the counts provides",
    "a strong constraint on source count models by constraining the local luminosity function such as @xmath22 and @xmath25 of the schechter luminosity function since different assumptions on these parameters can produce very different normalizations .",
    "for observed source counts , in particularly at 15@xmath0 m we will be able to confirm which of the elais fields ( elais n or s ) is giving us the right picture since the elais s field has a much lower normalization ( gruppioni et al .",
    "2002 ) . in order to do this",
    ", we need to accurately separate the galaxies and stars , estimate the incompleteness , and assess effects of saturation for bright sources , among others . also , a combination of nep - deep and nep - wide data is necessary for more accurate source count over wide range of fluxes .",
    "therefore we leave such tasks for subsequent works . instead of showing differential count in a more accurate way",
    ", we simply show the histograms of the nep - wide sources detected in s9w , s11 , l15 and l18w in fig .",
    "[ histogram ] . the expected slope for uniform source distribution in euclidean geometry is also shown in this histograms .",
    "for the case of s9w and s11 , we have shown both the raw count without taking out stars , as well as the count for the non - stellar objects ( i.e. , galaxies ) by statistically correcting for stellar sources using the stellar fraction of fig .",
    "[ star_frac ] .",
    "since the stellar fractions in l15 and l18w are relatively small , the correction does not make any significantly different histogram .",
    "we find that the slopes of the number distribution for l15 and l18w sources are close to that of uniform distribution in euclidean space ( i.e. , 0.6 ) while the raw data of s9w and s11 show slightly less steep distribution .",
    "however , the flux distribution for non - stellar sources after correcting for stellar fraction becomes more consistent with the uniform source distribution , although the actual slopes in these passbands are still slightly flatter than l15 and l18w bands .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)figure11.ps    such a difference might be attributed by strong positive k - corrections from the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature ( in the s9w band ) and 11.3 @xmath0 m ( in the s11 band ) pah features .",
    "these features will be local at the brightest magnitudes and the decrease in slope seen to fainter magnitudes could be caused by these emission features leaving the pass bands resulting a decrease in flux .",
    "this would also lead to a non - euclidean slope at bright magnitudes in the short wavelength counts .",
    "the l15 and l18w band counts generally sample the higher redshift universe and are not so affected by local contributions .",
    "note that a similar effect was observed in the irac 8 @xmath0 m band which straddled the 7.7 @xmath0 m emission feature .",

    "the survey data consisting of 446 pointing observations at 8 band filters from 2 to 18 @xmath0 m are reduced .",
    "total number of sources detected at least in one filter band reaches about 104,000",
    ". however , the numbers of sources at mir passbands are significantly smaller than those at nir .",
    "the 5-@xmath26 detection limits are typically about 21.5@xmath7 2 - 5 @xmath0 m bands , 18.5 to 19.5@xmath7 for 7 to 18 @xmath0 m bands . our data will be complemented by the nep - deep survey data which are deeper than nep - wide with smaller areal coverage .",
    "we used the cfht optical data which covered 2 sq .",
    "deg . within the nep - wide survey area to identify the nature of the objects .",
    "in particular , we have used the stellarity parameter of sextractor to distinguish between stars and non - stellar objects which are external galaxies .",
    "the majority of mid infrared sources are thought to be star forming galaxies at redshift @xmath27 , while stars comprise around 10 - 20% .",
    "the shorter wavelength band ( 9 and 11 @xmath0 m ) sources contain more stars than longer wavelength bands ( 15 and 18 @xmath0 m ) in mir .",
    "the color - color diagrams at near and mid infrared show broader distribution in color - color space while stars are known to exist in narrow areas in these diagrams . in particular , n2-n4 versus n3-n4 cc diagram is found to be very useful in identifying stars as the stars have narrow ranges of these colors .",
    "the cc diagrams can also be used to identify galaxy types .",
    "for example , agn can be distinguished from relatively red n2-n4 color ( @xmath28 ) , while starburst galaxies show very red @xmath29 colors ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the s7-s11 color appears to be a good indicator for star formation rates .",
    "we have shown the histograms in magnitude for s9w , s11 , l15 and l18w bands .",
    "the detailed shapes of the histograms depend on the pass band , but s9w and s11 have less steep slope than l15 and l18w at bright ends ( brighter than 18 magnitude ) .",
    "such a difference have been caused by the contamination of stars for shorter wavelength bands , but strong positive k - correction from the 7.7 and 11.3 @xmath0 m may also be partially responsible . the l15 and l18w band source distribution is consistent with that of uniform sources in flat universe .",
