    "although isospin violation in nuclear physics is a rather mature topic@xcite , it has recently undergone a renaissance because of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt)@xcite . many of the phenomenology - based mechanisms that underlie the traditional approach to isospin violation in nuclear forces have been redone in @xmath0pt@xcite .",
    "most of the results of this reanalysis are the same as that of the traditional approach , which should be no surprise .",
    "there have nevertheless been several mechanisms that had been incompletely calculated using older techniques and have been recently completed in @xmath0pt , such as the static @xmath1@xmath2 exchange force@xcite , the two - pion - exchange charge - independence - breaking ( cib ) potential@xcite , and the two - pion - exchange charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) potential@xcite .",
    "the primary innovation of @xmath0pt , however , is the use of power counting to order the sizes of interactions and ( lagrangian ) building blocks in a well - defined way@xcite so that it is apparent which interactions and mechanisms are dominant . in some cases",
    "this leads to the identification of important contributions that had not been considered before , which in turn give results that are significantly different from traditional approaches .",
    "an example is charge - symmetry breaking in @xmath3 , where previously - ignored contributions required by chiral symmetry change the sign of the predicted front - back asymmetry@xcite , in agreement with subsequent data@xcite .",
    "the most important attribute of effective field theories is the underlying power counting that allows a systematic organization of calculations . in the case of @xmath0pt , which is the low - energy effective field theory based on the symmetries and scales of qcd@xcite ,",
    "the relevant scales for constructing nuclear potentials ( using weinberg power counting@xcite ) include the pion decay constant , @xmath4 93 mev , which sets the scale for pion emission or absorption , the pion mass , @xmath5 , which sets the scale for chiral - symmetry breaking , the typical nucleon momentum , @xmath6 , which is an inverse correlation length in nuclei , and the characteristic qcd scale , @xmath7 , which is the scale of qcd bound states appropriate for heavy mesons , nucleon resonances , etc .",
    "the latter are frozen out and do not explicitly appear , although their effect is present in the counter terms of the effective interactions .",
    "the resulting field theory is a power series in @xmath8 , and the number of powers of @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) is used to label individual terms in the lagrangian ( viz . , @xmath11 ) .",
    "in this way higher powers denote smaller terms , and this is an integral part of the organizing principle of @xmath0pt .",
    "chiral perturbation theory was originally applied@xcite to ordinary strong forces ( class i in the terminology of ref.@xcite ) and , for the two - nucleon potential , these calculations have now been completed at the two - loop level@xcite .",
    "a major success of the program has been the numerical determination of the coefficients of several counter terms in the @xmath0pt lagrangian whose role had previously been restricted to pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "this determination used partial - wave analysis of nucleon - nucleon scattering data to isolate the contributions proportional to those counter terms@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0pt formalism was extended in ref.@xcite to incorporate isospin violation in nuclear forces .",
    "the extended theory has now been applied to charge - independence - breaking forces@xcite ( class ii forces ) and ordinary charge - symmetry - breaking forces@xcite ( class iii forces ) .",
    "the latter are determined by differences between `` mirror '' forces in a given multiplet , such as the difference between @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) forces within the @xmath16 isomultiplet ( for later notational consistency we will uniformly use `` 3 '' rather than `` @xmath17 '' to refer to the third component of an isospin vector ) . in this work we will complete the list by treating class iv charge - symmetry - breaking two - nucleon forces@xcite , which lead to transitions ( only ) between the @xmath18 to @xmath16 isomultiplets in the @xmath19 system .",
    "we also note that the scales of isospin violation in @xmath0pt were used in the past@xcite to prove that these forces satisfy ( in magnitude ) class i @xmath20 class ii @xmath20 class iii @xmath20 class iv .    while electromagnetic interactions break charge independence in general , the up - down quark - mass difference breaks charge symmetry specifically .",
    "csb observables can , therefore , be linearly sensitive to the up - down quark - mass difference , while cib observables that are charge symmetric at best depend quadratically on the quark - mass difference .",
    "since the quark - mass difference is small on a typical hadronic scale , cib is for all practical purposes dominated by electromagnetism .",
    "interest on quark masses takes us to csb .    at low energies",
    ", csb originates from a variety of sources , but the terms favored by power counting are associated with the nucleon mass difference . in general , in order to understand csb at low energies we need to include the effects of the nucleon mass difference . in sect .",
    "[ nmd ] we invent a field redefinition that removes the nucleon - mass - difference term from the low - energy effective lagrangian at the expense of new interactions . in sect .",
    "[ class23 ] we show that the previous calculations of class ii and iii forces are very easily reproduced in the new field basis .",
    "the implications for class iv forces in @xmath0pt are discussed in sects .",
    "[ class4 ] and [ comcon ] .",
    "the mass difference between the proton and neutron , @xmath21 , plays an important role in charge - symmetry breaking .",
    "this mass difference arises from two separate physical mechanisms .",
    "one of these is the up - down quark - mass difference , which dominates and makes the neutron heavier than the proton .",
    "the other mechanism is hard electromagnetic ( em ) interactions at the quark level , which tends to make the proton heavier than the neutron .",
    "the dimensionless parameter associated with up - down quark - mass - difference isospin violation is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and we have chosen @xmath24 to be the mass of the @xmath25 meson . the parameter associated with hard em interactions is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "in addition to these mechanisms , which have an origin in short - distance physics , there are also important soft - photon contributions ( such as the coulomb interaction between protons ) that dominate isospin violation in nuclei .",
    "all three of these mechanisms contribute to class iv forces .",
    "because asymptotic nuclear states individually reflect the appropriate nucleon masses , previous work on class iii forces noted that only those nuclear intermediate states where @xmath28 changes will contribute to isospin violation .",
    "an example would be @xmath12 scattering with the emission of two @xmath29 mesons ( creating an @xmath14 intermediate nucleon configuration with a different mass ) and subsequent reabsorption of the pions .",
    "in ref.@xcite we adopted a subtraction procedure that accomplished the necessary bookkeeping , although it was somewhat awkward and would have been difficult to generalize to more complicated operators ( such as three - body forces ) . in what follows below",
    "we will use a field redefinition procedure that simply removes the @xmath30 mass difference from the asymptotic states ( in terms of an average nucleon mass , @xmath31 ) and compensates for this by introducing new effective interactions determined by @xmath32 that must be treated in perturbation theory .",
    "we illustrate the method in the lowest chiral orders , in which case only the lowest orders in @xmath32 appear .",
    "in addition , for the sake of simplicity , we display in the equations below only those few terms of most interest for the nuclear potential .",
    "it should of course be kept in mind that the @xmath0pt lagrangian includes all terms allowed by qcd symmetries , and that at each chiral order all powers of pion fields are required by chiral symmetry .",
    "the leading - order lagrangian in @xmath0pt is @xmath33      + n^{\\dagger}[i\\partial_{0}-\\frac{1}{4 { f_{\\pi}}^{2 } } { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}\\cdot           ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\pi$}}\\times\\dot{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\pi$}}})]n + \\frac{g_{a}}{2 { f_{\\pi } } }    n^{\\dagger}{\\vec{\\sigma}}\\cdot{\\vec{\\nabla}}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}\\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\pi$}})n + \\ldots\\ , ,   \\label{eqno(1)}\\ ] ] while the sub - leading - order lagrangian is given by @xmath34 in these equations @xmath35",
    "( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 gev@xmath39 ) are parameters not determined by chiral symmetry , and `` @xmath40 '' denote terms that we do not require@xcite .",
    "there are three @xmath41 terms with one pion interacting with a single nucleon ; we will comment further on them below .",
    "in addition to these class i interactions we have isospin - violating interactions , a comprehensive list of which can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we are here particularly interested in the interactions generated by the quark - mass ( @xmath42 ) and hard - photon ( @xmath43 ) contributions to the nucleon mass ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 for reasons that will soon become obvious we have also shown explicitly the pion - mass - splitting term .",
    "this term is dominated by the electromagnetic contribution , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , since the contribution from the quark masses is small , @xmath48 .",
    "because of the quark - mass contribution , @xmath32 counts formally as chiral order @xmath49 .",
    "( see , however , the discussion in sect .",
    "[ comcon ] . ) noting that @xmath50 is numerically comparable to @xmath51 and adjusting our power counting of em terms accordingly , the pion - mass splitting term then counts as @xmath49 , and all other isospin - violating interactions are of higher order@xcite .",
    "the average nucleon mass @xmath52 has already been removed from consideration by means of the time - dependent transformation @xmath53 , which uses the fact that only the second term in eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(1 ) ] ) contains a time derivative of a nucleon field , while the exponential multiplying @xmath54 commutes with everything else .",
    "that procedure will not work straightforwardly for the @xmath32 term because @xmath55 does not commute with other nucleon isospin operators in @xmath11 .",
    "one can eliminate the first term in eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(3 ) ] ) by an appropriate redefinition of the nucleon field , @xmath56 in the process , however , we create interactions that are explicitly dependent on the time @xmath57 , unless we also redefine the pion fields . using eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(4a ) ] ) we find @xmath58 where @xmath59 the transformations for the cartesian components of @xmath60 show that they are identical to those of a coordinate rotation about the @xmath17-axis in isospin space by an angle @xmath61 .",
    "this immediately suggests the corresponding form for the pion transformation : @xmath62    to leading order in @xmath63 this pair of transformations is nothing more than the usual @xmath64 generators for ( electric ) charge conservation .",
    "application of these transformations demonstrates that @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are invariant , as one expects .",
    "only terms that involve a time derivative in the lagrangian are not invariant , and these will generate new lagrangian terms@xcite that compensate for the rotating isospin coordinate system , each of them modifying the isospin - violating lagrangian .",
    "each time derivative can introduce one power of @xmath32 into the final result in eqn .",

    "although the original nucleon - mass - difference term in eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(3 ) ] ) is charge - symmetry breaking , some of the new interactions will be charge symmetric .    since the maximum number of derivatives at order @xmath10 is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of fermion fields , the above field redefinition generates a finite number of new terms at each chiral order .",

    "this produces a class iv interaction of the type ( [ eqno(7b ) ] ) with @xmath157 where @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) is the neutron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "this interaction is @xmath160 smaller than coulomb exchange .",
    "if one takes @xmath50 as @xmath51 , this interaction counts as @xmath161 .",
    "much of the recent interest in class iv csb forces has centered around two sets of very different experiments .",
    "the first set of three experiments measured the difference in neutron and proton analyzing powers in elastic @xmath19 scattering at 183 mev@xcite , 347 mev@xcite , and 477 mev@xcite neutron ( lab ) energies .",
    "some recent reviews of csb that discuss these measurements are listed in ref.@xcite .",
    "agreement between theory and experiment is quite good .",
    "three dominant mechanisms contribute to the theoretical description : ( a ) the em breit interaction between the neutron magnetic moment and the proton charge ( given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(20 ) ] ) ) ; ( b ) the class iv opep given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(10 ) ] ) ; ( c ) the short - range @xmath25@xmath155-mixing force .",
    "additional small contributions from @xmath25-exchange and @xmath162-exchange are sometimes included .",
    "our @xmath0pt derivation agrees with the previously obtained results for these forces .",
    "the breit - interaction class iv force was first mentioned in the context of class iv experimental tests by refs.@xcite .",
    "it is an important contribution and is included in all comprehensive calculations .",
    "the importance of the nucleon - mass difference in the presence of one - pion exchange in a relativistic model was emphasized by gersten@xcite , who did not calculate a potential .",
    "a potential was calculated in ref.@xcite , which verified that both pseudovector and pseudoscalar ( relativistic ) coupling of a pion to a nucleon gave identical results for the class iv opep , presumably because the overall momentum dependence of the force is determined by galilean invariance .",
    "we note , however , that other terms would not be the same ; pseudoscalar coupling is very dangerous to use if one wishes to preserve chiral symmetry , and for this reason can lead to anomalous results .",
    "the class iv opep corresponds to @xmath78 in power counting .",
    "calculations also include short - range forces from @xmath25@xmath155 mixing .",
    "although the @xmath25@xmath155-mixing force is part of the short - range @xmath0pt counter term ( and hence of undetermined size ) in eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(21 ) ] ) , its coefficient in the traditional approach is fixed by @xmath163-mixing experiments@xcite .",
    "thus there are no adjustable constants in the dominant contributions to the traditional theory of class iv forces , and this leads to impressive agreement with experiment .",
    "other ingredients have been used in calculations , including two - pion exchange forces@xcite and heavy - meson exchange modified by @xmath138@xcite .",
    "reference @xcite has a particularly useful catalog of forces based on the exchange of different types of particles .",
    "these mechanisms are smaller than the ones given above . in @xmath0pt two - pion exchange",
    "can be calculated explicitly at @xmath84 , and all heavy - meson - exchange contributions are subsumed in contact interactions to be fitted to experiment .",
    "recent calculations typically combine the dominant forces with a subset of the smaller ones@xcite .",
    "these recent numerical calculations point out a potentially serious problem with the power counting .",
    "the three dominant mechanisms ( breit interaction , opep , and meson mixing ) are all approximately the same size .",
    "the power counting would suggest that the opep should dominate the meson - mixing potential by a factor of roughly 30 . to understand this discrepancy it is useful to substitute the estimate of @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 in the momentum - space expressions for these three forces , while ignoring the spin and isospin factors .",
    "doing this reveals that all three forces are within a factor of two of each other in size .",
    "the contradiction with naive power counting arises from the smaller than normal opep ( by a factor of more than 5 ) and the larger than normal meson - mixing force ( by a factor of about 3 ) .",
    "the reason for the former is that the opep isospin violation is proportional to @xmath167 mev , while the dimensional estimate for the quark - mass component of this is @xmath168 mev .",
    "the physical mass difference is the result of cancellation between the quark - mass - difference effect and the em contribution ( of opposite sign ) , and is fine tuned to the correct physical value .",
    "its size is therefore anomalously small and more typical of @xmath161 terms in the power counting .",
    "the large class iv meson - mixing force is primarily the result of the large @xmath169nucleon tensor coupling ( @xmath170 ) that has been used historically , although this coupling plays only a minor role in class iii forces . to see this we strip the dimensional factors from the @xmath163-mixing force in momentum space and compare the result to eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(21 ) ] ) : @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the usual @xmath25- and @xmath155-nucleon coupling constants , @xmath174 determines the strength of the @xmath25-nucleon tensor - coupling term , @xmath175 is the @xmath163-mixing matrix element , and @xmath176 is the common value chosen for the mass of these two mesons .",
    "on the basis of arguments given in ref.@xcite we expect that @xmath177 is the natural dimensionless coupling strength of any vector meson to the nucleon .",
    "we similarly expect that @xmath178 , where @xmath179 should be natural .",
    "this leads to @xmath180 $ ] . using a typical set of values for the coupling constants used in class iv calculations",
    "( see table i of ref .",
    "@xcite ) we find @xmath181 , and @xmath182 , and the product of these factors is 2.9 , which is large but natural .",
    "using the vector - dominance value for @xmath183 ( i.e. , 3.7 ) would lead to a smaller value , as would a smaller @xmath184@xcite .",
    "even larger values of these coupling constants have been occasionally used in class iv calculations .",
    "the fact that @xmath163 mixing seems to provide the necessary additional ingredient for conventional calculations to agree with experiment suggests that a @xmath0pt calculation at @xmath84 will also be successful . at this order ,",
    "@xmath0pt includes a contact interaction of the appropriate form , and the previous discussion implies that a relatively large , but not unnatural , coefficient would suffice .    note that this argument does not rely on @xmath163 mixing providing the correct short - range force .",
    "for example , an alternative short - range force from isospin violation in the coupling constants of vector mesons has been proposed by ref.@xcite .",
    "that result is compatible in sign and magnitude with the @xmath163-mixing force .",
    "the sum of the two mechanisms is too large to reproduce the experimental data , if the above values for @xmath25 and @xmath155 parameters are used .",
    "in fact , these two mechanisms can not be distinguished at low energies : only their sum , together with an infinite number of other csb short - range interactions , can be determined .",
    "all short - range mechanisms are subsumed in @xmath185 , and a @xmath185 of about 3 times its natural size seems to be appropriate .",
    "how much each short - range mechanism contributes to @xmath185 can only be decided at higher energies than those accessible to @xmath0pt .    of course",
    ", the above arguments are purely suggestive .",
    "a consistent , model - independent calculation is required before more definitive statements can be made .",
    "a framework for such a calculation is provided by the nijmegen partial - wave analysis ( pwa)@xcite . in this",
    "pwa long - range forces , including eqns .",
    "( [ eqno(8 ) ] ) and ( [ eqno(20 ) ] ) , are used as input , and a general boundary condition at a certain radius , which represents short - range forces , is adjusted until it reproduces data . the iucf and triumf data have not been analyzed in detail yet .",
    "it will be very interesting to see to what extent a short - range parameter equivalent to a natural - sized @xmath185 can reproduce the available data , in particular their energy dependence@xcite .",
    "preliminary estimates suggest that the long - range parts of the opep and breit interactions alone account for about half of the experimental values at all three energies .",
    "finally we recall that the original version of the proof@xcite that isospin - dependent forces satisfy ( in magnitude ) class i @xmath20 class ii @xmath20 class iii @xmath20 class iv took into account the structure of class iv short - range forces , but not the corresponding opep ( which is momentum dependent ) .",
    "although the size of the latter estimated from power counting ( @xmath78 ) is nominally the same as that of class iii forces , its suppression due to cancellations and fine tuning ( to reproduce the physical nucleon mass ) makes the class iv opep more typical of @xmath79 size , and therefore the results of the proof are not altered .",
    "the second set of two csb experiments measured @xmath186 production : @xmath187@xcite and @xmath188@xcite .",
    "the front - back asymmetry is the csb signal in the first reaction , while the cross - section of the second reaction vanishes in the absence of isospin mixing .",
    "the effect of the second and third terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(3 ) ] ) on the @xmath189 front - back asymmetry was calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was found to be relatively large , and of opposite sign to other mechanisms .",
    "this prediction is in good agreement with the experimental result@xcite .",
    "the situation is considerably more complicated for @xmath190 .",
    "a preliminary , simplified calculation@xcite suggests that various mechanisms contribute significantly .",
    "both reactions should be further studied .",
    "the field redefinitions that were invented in eqns .",
    "( [ eqno(4a ) ] ) and ( [ eqno(4b ) ] ) and lead to eqn .",
    "( [ eqno(5 ) ] ) could prove useful in this regard .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have presented a convenient framework in which to analyze nuclear effects of the nucleon - mass difference .",
