    "the main motivation for deriving atomic effective pseudopotentials ( aeps ) relies on the computational savings that may be gained by circumventing the self - consistent optimization of the density , which is at the heart of density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the aim is thereby to address the omnipresent nanoscale , where the relevant structures include thousands , and often hundred thousands , of atoms .",
    "the philosophy behind an aep , not only bypasses the need for a self - consistent solution , but also allows to focus on a selected part of the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "the number of  bands \" that scales with the number of atoms in dft , is now independent of the system size .",
    "this latter characteristic is ideal for the study of optical properties or transport , where mainly the energy states around the band gap of the materials are involved .",
    "the idea to replace the strong coulomb potential of the nucleus together with the bound electrons by an effective , weaker ( pseudo)potential is not new @xcite .",
    "the first generation of the method@xcite was based on the fitting of an empirical pseudopotential constructed to reproduce experimentally determined energy levels of bulk crystals . in this procedure ,",
    "known as the empirical pseudopotential method ( epm ) , the entire band structure as well as optical properties of bulk solids can be obtained with good accuracy with only very few fourier components of the pseudopotential ( in the order of three ) .",
    "these few parameters were simply used as fitting parameters and adjusted to reproduce known quantities .    in the original epm",
    ", the parameters were directly linked to the investigated bulk structure through the use of certain @xmath0-vectors and transferability ( i.e. the applicability of one potential to different lattice constants or different structures ) was not supported by this type of construction . a simple extension via interpolation to neighboring points in @xmath0-space @xcite or a full analytic dependence of the pseudopotential on",
    "the length of the @xmath0-vectors @xcite was a natural extension of the method . with these continuous empirical pseudopotentials , together with massively parallel codes @xcite or with favorable basis sets",
    "@xcite , the electronic and optical properties of nanostructures could be accurately calculated @xcite , as well as transport properties @xcite .    with the aim of getting an improvement in the quality of the wave functions , and hence of the transferability ,",
    "a second generation of empirical pseudopotentials was developed by wang , fu and zunger@xcite . in this approach",
    ", a series of bulk self - consistent dft calculations , in the local density approximation ( lda ) , are performed using a few different structures ( zincblende , wurtzite , ... ) at different lattice constants .",
    "the screened local effective potentials from dft are transformed to @xmath1 space and fitted by a set of gaussian functions .",
    "this results in a continuous representation of the atomic empirical potentials in @xmath1 space with a good transferability between different bulk structures .",
    "however , as the structures used in the potential generation are all bulk systems , no information on the long range ( small @xmath0-vector ) inter - atomic interaction is available .",
    "hence the potentials at @xmath0-vectors shorter than @xmath2 divided by the lattice constant , remains unknown .",
    "unfortunately , it is precisely this range of @xmath0-vectors that becomes relevant for the calculation of nanostructures , where the shortest relevant @xmath0-vectors is given by @xmath2 divided by the cluster size . in the original work @xcite ,",
    "the gaussian function was interpolated from the shortest known @xmath0-vector ( 2@xmath3 ) to the @xmath0=0 point .",
    "the potential at the @xmath0=0 was adjusted to reproduce experimentally known work functions @xcite and later using an atomic model potential and screening @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the energy cut - off was significantly reduced to save computational resources , so that an empirical gaussian function had to be introduced to compensate for this reduction .",
    "although the quality of the ensuing semiempirical pseudopotentials ( sepm ) must be expected to be significantly higher than the epm , these difficulties may have been the reason for the rather limited use of this potential generation .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new generation of pseudopotentials following the philosophy of the epm and sepm to derive a pseudopotential that represent the scattering due to all the electrons . in this sense , it is distinct from the ionic pseudopotentials derived for dft @xcite , although we use a separable formalism to treat the non - local part of the potential stemming from this community @xcite .",
    "we derive our atomic effective pseudopotentials ( aeps ) via an analytic connection to the effective crystal potential from dft .",
    "the use of large and judiciously chosen slightly deformed supercells gives us access to the long range response of the potential .",
    "we therefore derive the pseudopotentials on a very dense grid of @xmath1 vectors , including both , the long and short range interaction regimes .",
    "the method is free of parameters and does not involve any fitting procedure and is as _ ab initio _ as the underlying dft calculations .",
    "this simplicity allows us to generate , with a minimum of effort , unique ( for a certain dft norm - conserving pseudopotential ) aeps .",
    "we have successfully generated aeps for 20 compound semiconductor materials .",
    "a comparison between the results of our code latepp@xcite using our aeps and dft@xcite shows differences for the bulk calculations in the order of a few tenth of mev , which originates from our spherical approximation of the local part of the potential .",
    "we have tested the transferability of the potential on different types of quantum wells and find very satisfying results , demonstrating a high level of transferability .",
    "our methodology is based on dft@xcite where the central quantity is the effective kohn - sham potential @xmath4 that describes all the interactions of a single electron with its environment : @xmath5 + v^{\\rm xc}[n(\\bm r ) ]   \\label{eq : effpot } \\\\ & & n(\\bm r ) = \\sum_i^{\\rm occ } |\\psi_i(\\bm r)|^2 \\quad , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the charge density of all occupied single - particle states @xmath7 .",

    "a good choice is to take one of the @xmath20-channels of the atomic pseudopotential .",
    "since the local potential and all the @xmath20-components of the potential have the same long - range behavior , this formal transformation leads to @xmath20-dependent potentials that differ from zero only within spheres with radius @xmath21 .",

    "( [ eq : locsplit ] ) it is clear that the truncation to @xmath22 only applies to the non - local parts of the potential .",

    "<S> we derive an analytic connection between the screened self - consistent effective potential from density functional theory ( dft ) and atomic effective pseudopotentials ( aeps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation to derive aeps is to address structures with thousands to hundred thousand atoms , as given in most nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> the use of aeps allows to bypass a self - consistent procedure and to address eigenstates around a certain region of the spectrum ( e.g. , around the band gap ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk aep construction requires two simple dft calculations of slightly deformed elongated cells . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing aeps are given on a fine reciprocal space grid , including the small reciprocal vector components , are free of parameters , and involve no fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we further show how to connect the aeps of different bulk materials , which is necessary to obtain accurate band offsets . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a total of 20 aeps for iii - v , ii - vi and group iv semiconductors and demonstrate their accuracy and transferability by comparison to dft calculations of strained bulk structures , quantum wells with varying thickness , and semiconductor alloys . </S>"
