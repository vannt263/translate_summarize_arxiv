    "the terrain of the so called diluted magnetic oxides ( dmo ) is currently being explored with a strong drive to find room temperature ( rt ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials for possible technological applications @xcite .",
    "dmo are experimentally obtained by doping the oxide matrix with a small amount of magnetic transition metal ( tm ) ions .",
    "this procedure may introduce ferromagnetism in otherwise non magnetic materials and opens up the feasibility of applications that range from spintronics to magneto- optical devices .    since the pioneering works of dietl _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in mn - doped zno , rt ferromagnetism was observed in various doped oxide hosts @xcite with different tm ions and doping concentrations .",
    "some dmo are fm insulators while others are semiconductors and , so far , there is not an obvious link between the ferromagnetic behavior and the conduction properties .",
    "the samples are sensitive both to preparation methods and growth conditions and this observation supports the idea that ferromagnetism might be closely linked to defects and/or to the presence of oxygen vacancies .",
    "interesting for spintronic applications are critical temperatures being far above room temperature .    among dmo , co - doped ceo@xmath1 ( co@xmath2ce@xmath3o@xmath4 ) has attracted particular interest due to ferromagnetic behavior observed well above rt for low co - doping concentration @xcite . moreover",
    ", ceria is a transparent and high dielectric constant rare - earth oxide , whose fluorite structure matches well with that of silicon .",
    "it keeps the crystal structure , both , under doping and upon the formation of oxygen vacancies , thus promising a good integrability for spintronic devices even for non - stoichiometric compounds . however , there is controversy among the experimental results regarding critical temperatures and the values of the magnetic moments , as a function of doping concentration . as a matter of fact",
    ", a wide range of magnetic moments has been reported @xcite and this has raised concerns about the intrinsic nature of the fm properties of these materials due , for example , to co secondary phases , heterogeneities or even contamination .    the presence of oxygen vacancies has been considered as a possible factor affecting the fm response in the case of films @xcite but it is not yet clear whether it induces co clustering and/or promotes magnetic ordering . it has been recently argued that even without introducing magnetic impurities , the presence of oxygen vacancies in ceo@xmath1 could stabilize ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "there is experimental evidence available , obtained using several techniques @xcite , indicating that the charge left behind by the oxygen vacancies gets localized near some ce atoms driving the ce@xmath5 to ce@xmath0 reduction . in the case of undoped ceria surfaces , this localization has been recently addressed by ganduglia - pirovano _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the charge localization happens both in doped as well as in undoped ceo@xmath6 , and has to be properly taken into account since it might affect atomic relaxation and , in turn , the magnetic behavior .",
    "it is important to remark that in order to perform a theoretical study of the magnetic properties of co - doped reduced ceria , it is critical to relax the crystal structure .",
    "previous ab - initio dft+u calculations have reported a detailed description of the relaxation processes in reduced ceria upon doping with transition metal atoms such as zr@xcite and pd@xcite .",
    "it results that relaxation is different in zr - doped systems as compared to the pd - doped ones , because the electronic distribution , which changes upon reduction @xcite , depends on the size and the chemical characteristics of the dopant .",
    "our goal in this paper is to explore the role played by oxygen vacancies on the magnetic properties of a bulk ceria matrix as a function of co - doping concentration .",
    "we perform local density approximation ( lsda)+u calculations@xcite considering bulk unit cells with substitutional replacement of co atoms into cerium sites @xcite . in this work",
    "we take into account , in the relaxation process , the presence of ce@xmath0 ions induced by reduction .",
    "we also consider the evolution of the magnetic interactions with the number of oxygen vacancies per co atom , which ( to the best of our knowledge ) has not yet been reported for doped ceria .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method - of - calculation ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : supercell ] , the computational method is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : location - vacancies ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : ionic - relaxation ] , the effect of introducing oxygen vacancies in co - doped ceria is studied . in sec .",
    "[ sec : properties ] , the magnetic and electronic properties as a function of the dopant concentration and oxygen deficiency are explained and finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , the results of this work are discussed .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite calculations are performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "we use the full potential augmented plane waves method as implemented in the wien2k code @xcite , where the space is divided into muffin tin ( mt ) spheres around the atoms and an interstitial region .",
    "plane waves are used to describe the region outside the spheres .",
    "the muffin tin radii used are r@xmath7 = 1.9 au , r@xmath8 = 1.6 au , r@xmath9 = 2.3 au .",
    "the number of plane waves in the interstitial region is set by the cut - off parameter rk@xmath10=7 ( or 6 for the biggest cells ) where r is the minimum r@xmath11 in the corresponding cell . to attain the desired convergence precision",
    ", we use a 7 x 7 x 7 k - mesh in the brillouin zone for a co - doping concentration of x=12.5 % and a 5 x 5 x 5 mesh for x=6.25 % .    in the cases where we have charge localization on the 4@xmath12 states of ce ( which we call ce@xmath0 ) , the structures are first allowed to relax taking these 4@xmath12 electrons as core levels @xcite , until forces on atoms are below 1 mry / au .",
    "then , the electronic structure of the fully relaxed supercell is obtained using the lsda+u approach switching on the local coulomb interaction in the ce@xmath0 ions @xcite with u@xmath13=u - j = 6 ev @xcite .",
    "the relaxation processes involved will be described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ionic - relaxation ] .",
    "the crystal structure of ceo@xmath1 is fluorite with an experimental lattice parameter of 5.411  .",
    "each ce@xmath5 cation is coordinated to eight o@xmath14 nearest neighbors and in turn , each o@xmath14 is tetrahedrally coordinated to ce@xmath5 cations .",
    "previous theoretical results for doped ceria indicate very small changes in the lattice constants upon doping with different transition metals , while preserving the cubic symmetry @xcite . in particular , when doping with zr , a 0.2% contraction in the lattice parameters is obtained @xcite and a 0.04% reduction , when doping with pd @xcite .",
    "taking this fact into account , we consider the experimental lattice constants of unreduced ceo@xmath1 for all the systems under study .",
    "however , as we are interested in understanding the effect of both , magnetic impurities and oxygen vacancies , it is essential to relax the internal atomic positions , as mentioned in the previous section .    for a concentration of co given by x=6.25 %",
    ", we use a 2x2x2 bcc - type supercell , and for x=12.5 % , a 2x2x2 fcc - type one .",
    "the supercells are built out of the conventional 12-atoms cubic unit cell of ceo@xmath1 and are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ supercell ] . for the unreduced compounds",
    "these supercells contain 48 and 24 atoms , respectively .",
    "the nearest neighbor distance between co atoms is 9.37   in the bcc cell and 7.65    in the fcc one , so that these atoms can be safely considered as impurities .    ]    for each concentration we study configurations with zero , one or two vacancies per co impurity atom .",
    "when an oxygen vacancy is created in pure bulk ceo@xmath1 , two electrons are left in the system and the vacancy is surrounded by four next nearest neighbor ce atoms . as mentioned before ,",
    "several experimental results seem to indicate that these extra electrons occupy localized @xmath15 states on two ce sites .",
    "there are then , two types of ce atoms : ce@xmath5 ions in a 4@xmath16-like configuration and ce@xmath0 ions in a 4@xmath17 one , that need to be considered theoretically ( see for instance ref . and , and references therein ) .",
    "when co impurities are introduced , the system gains in complexity .",
    "x - ray experiments suggest that in oxygen deficient samples the valence of co is 2 + ( see refs . ) . regarding ce , the presence of ce@xmath0 has been reported in refs . .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    ", for a sample with a 4.5 % co concentration , the results seem to indicate that around 10% of the ce atoms are ce@xmath0 while the others are ce@xmath5 .    taking the above into account , in this work",
    "we consider a variety of situations , depending on the number of oxygen vacancies per impurity co atom , as it will be detailed in the following section .",
    "the first question which arises when introducing vacancies into the co - ceo@xmath1 system relates to their location within the ceria matrix : what is energetically more favorable , to have oxygen vacancies close to or far from the co impurities ? to answer this question",
    "we first place one vacancy in a site nearest neighbor to a co atom and relax the structure for the case x=12.5 % .",
    "we then put the oxygen vacancy far away from the co atom and after relaxing the structure , compare both results . in view of the experimental evidence mentioned in the previous section and the model suggested by vodungbo _",
    "@xcite , we consider that the extra electrons left behind by the vacancy , migrate to the co atoms leaving all the ce ions as ce@xmath5 , for both vacancy locations .",
    "the difference in energy between the two considered vacancy configurations is 0.55 ev per co atom in favor of the vacancy being close to the impurity ( see fig [ flo : scheme - vac].(b ) .",
    "we also consider a larger concentration of vacancies , namely , two per co impurity atom and perform the calculations for x=6.25 % .",
    "we take into account two possibilities : a configuration where the two oxygen vacancies are close to the co atom as suggested in ref .",
    "( see scheme in fig .",
    "[ flo : scheme - vac].(c ) ) and a configuration where one oxygen vacancy is close to the impurity while the other is far away from it . comparing the total energies of both configurations",
    ", we find that the two oxygen vacancies prefer to be close to the co atom by 0.62 ev per co atom .",
    "it is clear from these results that cobalt has a strong tendency to nucleate oxygen vacancies in ceria . in the following sections we discuss the relaxation process , the electronic structure and the magnetic couplings for the most favorable spacial distribution of vacancies .",
    "[ squeme - vac ]",
    "as discussed in the previous section , for the doped system without oxygen vacancies , both co and ce are expected to be + 4 and therefore we use conventional lsda calculations to relax the supercells for the two impurity concentrations considered .",
    "the obtained relaxations are qualitatively similar : the eight oxygen atoms which surround the impurity get symmetrically closer to it by 0.09    ( for x=6.25% ) and by 0.07    ( for x=12.5% ) . regarding the nearest cerium atoms , they move towards the impurity by around 0.04    for x=6.25% , while they do not relax due to symmetry reasons for the largest concentration considered .",
    "the valence configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ flo : scheme - vac].(b ) .",
    "as there are no localized 4@xmath12 electrons in the cell for this vacancy concentration , we use again conventional lsda calculations and focus only on x=12.5% .",
    "after relaxation , the seven oxygen atoms , which stay around the impurity after creating the vacancy , undergo a displacement of around 0.06    in average : one oxygen moves towards co considerably ( @xmath180.3  ) , three oxygen atoms get closer to it by @xmath180.11   and the last three ones move outwards by @xmath180.07  . regarding the nearest neighbors of the vacancy , the nearest three ce ions and the co impurity move outwards with respect to it ( the ce atoms displace by 0.1    and the co atom by 0.28  ) while the six nearest neighbor oxygen atoms move towards the vacancy by 0.15  on the average .",
    "we consider the most stable vacancy location , namely , the two vacancies being near the impurity atom .",
    "as mentioned above , in this case , the extra electronic charge left behind by the vacancy , localizes at two ce atoms , which are nearest neighbors to co.    after relaxation , the six oxygen atoms surrounding the transition metal impurity move towards it . for x=6.25 % ,",
    "two of them displace by @xmath180.27    while the other four do it by @xmath180.15  .",
    "the oxygen atoms which are nearest neighbors to the ce@xmath0 ions move away from them in average about 0.1  .",
    "this expansion of all oxygen atoms around the ce@xmath0 has to do with the coulomb repulsion due to the extra charge localized at that ce site .",
    "in contrast , this is not observed around the ce@xmath5 ions , where some of the nearest neighbor oxygen atoms get closer to these ions while others move away , but without undergoing a net expansion of the oxygen - cloud .",
    "qualitatively similar atomic relaxations are obtained for x=12.5% .",
    "it is clear that the introduction of vacancies produces an important rearrangement of the structure .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results obtained when doping with co with those appearing in the literature for other dopants such as zr or pd .",
    "the available data include cases considering just one vacancy per impurity @xcite .    for unreduced ceria , relaxation in the presence of zr impurities",
    "is similar to that of co : the 8 nearest neighbor oxygen atoms and the three nearest ce@xmath5 ions move towards the impurity by @xmath180.1    and @xmath180.036   , respectively @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that zr and co have smaller atomic radii than the ce@xmath5 ion . when doping with pd , which has an atomic radius similar to the ionic radius of ce@xmath5 , the displacements towards the impurity are smaller than in the case of zr and co @xcite .",
    "in the presence of one oxygen vacancy , relaxation for co - doping resembles neither the pd nor the zr dopant cases .",
    "co and zr move away from the vacancy while pd moves towards it .",
    "all nearest neighbor oxygen atoms get closer to the vacancy when the dopants are co and pd . in the case of zr ,",
    "most of those oxygen ions move towards the vacancy except for one oxygen that moves away from it @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned differences in the relaxation processes might be due to different reasons : in the case of zr - doping , the charge left behind by the vacancy localizes on two neighboring ce atoms , while for pd and co it localizes both at the impurity site and at its nearest neighbor oxygen atoms . when doping with pd , the difference in relaxation might be due to the different size of the dopant atomic radii .",
    "before going into the analysis of the evolution of the electronic and magnetic properties of ceria as a function of dopant and vacancy concentration , it is interesting to determine the nature of the magnetic coupling between ce@xmath0 and co. from the above discussion , it is clear that this coupling takes place when two vacancies per co are present . to get insight into this problem , we consider the case of x=12.5% to compare the energies of fm and afm spin - alignments of ce@xmath0 with respect to co , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jcoce ] .",
    "the energy difference between these configurations is 120 mev per co atom in favor of the fm alignment .",
    "cobalt and ce@xmath0 ions show , then , a strong ferromagnetic coupling .     ions ( top , fm .",
    "bottom , afm ) .",

    "[ fig : dos - ceria ] ) . when impurities are introduced in the unreduced system , defect states appear due to majority and minority contributions coming from the @xmath20 states of the substitutional co atoms . for both impurity concentrations , and no oxygen vacancies ,",

    "in this work we have studied the effect of oxygen vacancies on the magnetic and electronic properties of co - doped ceria .",
    "we have shown that the introduction of oxygen vacancies is essential to drive a ferromagnetic coupling among the dopant impurities .",
    "actually , in the absence of vacancies there is a slight tendency towards an antiferromagnetic coupling that changes towards a ferromagnetic one , when the vacancy concentration increases .    for two vacancies per co , part of the left - behind charge localizes in ce ions sitting in the vicinity of the impurity , turning them into magnetic ce@xmath0 ions .",
    "we find that the magnetic coupling among the co impurities and the ce@xmath0 ions , is strongly ferromagnetic .",
    "this coupling provides a large magnetic moment , localized close to the impurity .",
    "even if co impurities in unreduced ceria show large local magnetic moments , the interaction among impurities is small for the two dopant concentrations studied .",
    "the same can be said about the systems with only one vacancy per impurity atom .",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling among impurities in the presence of two vacancies per co increases when going from an impurity concentration of 6.25 % to 12.5 % .",
    "we conclude that , although there is a clear tendency towards ferromagnetism in co doped ceria when oxygen vacancies are present , the obtained fm couplings can not explain the high curie temperatures observed in the experiments . on the other hand , the large values of the magnetic moments per co atom observed can be understood if the co impurities , the vacancies and the nearest ce@xmath0 ions build complexes of the type considered in this work . to understand the simultaneous appearance of the two phenomena , namely curie temperatures above rt and a wide spread in the large values of the magnetic moments per co dopant",
