    "the measurement of almost complete sets of spin observables has become technically feasible because newly developed polarized electron or photon beams and polarized targets offer high enough luminosity to permit measurement of the relevant observables .",
    "the reaction @xmath1 is particularly advantageous , since the angular asymmetry in the parity nonconserving weak decay @xmath2 provides a direct measurement of the @xmath3 s polarization .",
    "if the @xmath3 s spin state is measured along with the polarization of the beam ( @xmath4 ) or target ( p ) , then spin transfer and spin rotation observables can be measured .",
    "such spin - rich experiments are underway at elsa  @xcite and planned at cebaf  @xcite and graal  @xcite .    in an earlier publication  @xcite(fts ) , the general structure of the full set of 16 observables for k@xmath5 photoproduction was examined . in that discussion ,",
    "helicity amplitudes proved to be particularly useful for deducing general rules concerning the angular structure of the 15 spin observables .",
    "the sixteen observables ( the cross - section plus 15 spin observables ) were found to fall into four `` legendre classes , '' with four members in each class . the observables in each class have similar `` nodal structure '' possibilities e.g. , their values at 0@xmath6 and 180@xmath6 and their possible intervening nodes are of related nature .",
    "( that classification procedure , along with the advantages of transversity amplitudes , has led to a reformulation of the general problem of determining which experiments constitute a complete set of measurements . a generalization to many reactions , including electroproduction and photoproduction of vector mesons , will be published separately  @xcite . )    in addition , fts used various truncations , both in a helicity basis and in a multipole representation , to deduce rules concerning the nodal structure and energy evolution of all 15 spin observables . in this paper , those fts rules are confronted with specific dynamical models .",
    "the considered models@xcite are all based on an isobaric approach using diagrammatic techniques .",
    "these models include extended born terms and a very limited number of resonances in _",
    "s- _ and _ u-_channels supplemented by contributions from the _ t-_channel ; namely , by @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well as @xmath9 meson exchanges .",
    "we now comment briefly on each model and give the relevant baryonic resonances .",
    "first , the model of adelseck and saghai(as )  @xcite is used to calculate the spin observables .",
    "their model , which represents a good fit @xmath10 to the existing data up to @xmath11 gev , uses the @xmath12 and @xmath13 baryon resonances .  .",
    "] in addition , su(3 ) constraints , based on their success in strong interaction dynamics , are used to limit an otherwise oversupply of possible fits to the data .",
    "then , we also study the work of williams , ji and cotanch(wjc )  @xcite , who examined electromagnetic production processes with photons(real / virtual ) energies up to 2.1 gev . that group included the n@xmath14 , n@xmath15 , and @xmath16 baryon exchanges , plus a significant incorporation of crossing symmetry requirements .",
    "the third dynamical model considered here is a new model from the saclay - lyon group called saly  @xcite , which also gives good agreement with photoproduction data up to 2.1 gev and satisfies broken su(3 ) symmetry requirements .",
    "the saly model includes all of the above as baryon resonances plus the @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 baryon resonances .",
    "we emphasize that the first two models(as & wjc ) include only spin-1/2 baryonic resonances , while the third one(saly ) also includes spin-3/2 nucleonic resonances .",
    "spin 5/2 resonances are not included in any of these models .    among these three models , the wjc model has the weakest kaon exchange ( _ t-_channel ) contributions , while as has the strongest .",
    "the wjc model produces weak _ t-_channel exchange because their main coupling constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 were not subject to su(3)-symmetry constraints and in fitting data they generate quite small values of both the _ t-_channel and @xmath22 couplings compared to those produced in the as and saly fits .",
    "t-_channel coupling constants come out to be smaller in saly than in as .",
    "this feature arises since the saly model includes spin-3/2 baryonic resonances and hence the need for the _ t-_channel exchanges is reduced , in line with duality ideas  @xcite .",
    "the role of duality ( the interplay between s- and _ t-_channel strengths ) and its effect on spin observables is discussed in section iii.a.2 .",
    "can the general rules for spin observables conjectured in fts and summarized in section ii , be seen in the dynamical results ? what is the behavior of spin observables at lower energies and what role is played by particular baryonic resonances and by kaon exchanges ? how do the specific isobar and _ t-_channel dynamics of the three models affect spin observables ? are some spin observables particularly sensitive to interesting dynamics and are therefore particularly important to measure ?",
    "those questions are addressed in sections iii & iv .",
    "the general rules for the sixteen observables are described in detail in fts  @xcite , which also includes the derivation of such observables from a density matrix approach .",
    "here we simply highlight and confront those rules . for convenience ,",
    "the definition of the sixteen observables are recalled in appendix  a.      the legendre classes of the sixteen observables , which are labeled by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , are : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 these observables , which are defined as the product of the usual spin observable and the cross - section function @xmath31 are called profile functions  @xcite . the profile functions are proportional to bilinear products of amplitudes .",
    "observables are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the bilinear combination of helicity amplitudes @xmath32 for class @xmath33 observables by the real and imaginary parts of @xmath34 and for class @xmath35 observables by the real and imaginary parts of @xmath36 finally , the class @xmath37 observables are determined by the four combinations of the magnitudes @xmath38 in the above list , the first entry in each class is the cross - section or a single polarization observable @xmath39 the others are all double polarization observables , which appear ordered as beam - target @xmath40 beam - recoil @xmath41 with the last entry in each class being the target - recoil observables @xmath42 the angular dependence of the above observables are determined by expressing the four helicity amplitudes @xmath43 in terms of wigner rotation functions , with @xmath44 denoting the produced kaon s center - of - mass angle .",

    "all of these features agree with rule * h6*. however , the acquisition of an even number of nodes in @xmath173 for some models at and below 1.4 gev is a surprise , as will be discussed later .",
    "now let us return to the @xmath23 observables . at 1.4 gev ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the @xmath175 spin observables vary considerably with angle and some have nodes . the rules that : @xmath59 must have an even number of nodes ( * h2 * ) , and @xmath117 and @xmath176 an odd number of nodes ( * h1 * ) , are clearly satisfied .",
    "however , the three models manage to satify these theorems in different ways , especially in the number of nodes .",

    "all of the models display nodal structures consistent with the * h1 * @xmath78 * h6 * rules . to understand how these nodes develop with increasing energy , and the underlying reasons for the nodal structure of spin observables , it is more convenient to examine  nodal trajectory \" plots .",

    "3 . ( the cross - section , and hence @xmath31 is nodeless . )",
    "the recoil @xmath3 polarization , p in fig .",
    "3 , has : no nodes for the as model ; one node starting at @xmath178 at 1.47 gev for the wjc case ; and an early node starting at @xmath178 at 0.96 gev for the saly model . both as and wjc models do not have spin 3/2 resonances , in contrast to the spin 3/2 isobar that is part of the saly model .",
    "that isobar accounts for the dramatic difference in the observable p ; namely , the early @xmath178 node for the saly model and the subsequent strong energy dependence of its single node is a reflection of the 3/2 , @xmath90 resonance @xmath179 at about @xmath180 gev , corresponding to the total energy of @xmath181 gev in the center - of mass frame .",
    "the other models rely on _ t-_channel exchanges for their @xmath63 strength at low energies .",
    "similar reasoning applies to the observable @xmath165 in fig .  3 , which also has an early @xmath178 node for the saly model .",
    "for wjc , the target polarization @xmath165 has a node due to @xmath182 strength , but the node displays smooth non - resonant evolution since the wjc model has no @xmath63 resonances .",
    "thus , the nodal structure of @xmath144 & @xmath165 are sensitive to explicit _",
    "s-_channel spin 3/2 resonances , but are not so revealing concerning _ t-_channel contributions .",
    "the curves @xmath144 and @xmath165 for saly are therefore good examples of resonance - driven nodal trajectories and show how such plots can be used to extract detailed resonance dynamics .",
    "the same saly 3/2-resonances drive the spin observable @xmath61 , which has a particularly dramatic nodal trajectory as seen in fig .",
    "this case will be discussed in the beam - target section .    for the photon asymmetry",
    "observable , @xmath183 the bifurcating behavior seen in fig .",
    "3 for the as and wjc models is unexpected .",
    "this observable is _ not required _ to have an even number of nodes .",
    "( in contrast , @xmath131 is restricted to an even number of nodes , which is the reason for its bifurcating nodal trajectory . )",
    "_ to get two nodes in @xmath183 especially at low energies there has to be some j=5/2 amplitude strength .",
    "_ that strength is apparently not due to any 5/2 resonances , since none of the models have explicit @xmath184 resonances .",
    "instead , the @xmath184 strength at low energies arises from a _ t-_channel mechanism !",
    "the polarized beam asymmetry @xmath173 shows this unexpected double nodal structure for the as model at lower energies and at higher energies for the wjc model .",
    "for the saly model , a single node appears at @xmath178 and moves rapidly to @xmath185 two nodes appear at higher energy and evolve smoothly . in the region that saly has one node , this single node and its rapid motion can be accounted for by its @xmath63 resonances .",
    "the double node at higher energy for saly occurs when it picks up @xmath184 strength , probably from _",
    "t-_channel effects .",
    "the general form of the @xmath97 observable is @xmath186 where the terms @xmath187 and @xmath188 arise from interference between @xmath189 1/2 states , while the term @xmath190 arises only if @xmath191 states contribute ; for example , @xmath190 arises first from a @xmath192 amplitude interference .",
    "therefore , to get the double nodal structure seen for the as model near threshold , one needs a sizable @xmath190 term or , equivalently , at least @xmath184 multipoles .",
    "it is also clear from this general form that for small 5/2 , but sizable 3/2 , amplitudes , the term @xmath193 arises first from interference between @xmath194 and hence can give only one node .",
    "sc nodes , an observable needs to be described as @xmath195 times a polynomial of order @xmath196 in @xmath197 here @xmath198 depending on the legendre class @xmath199    the @xmath184 amplitudes could arise from a mechanism that boosts the orbital angular momentum to higher values .",
    "the striking of a virtual p - wave meson by a polarized incident photon ( t - channel exchange ) provides such a mechanism .",
    "for example , if a virtual @xmath200 kaon peals off from the nucleon in a p - wave , it can receive an extra orbital angular momentum boost when it is struck by the incident photon .",
    "the kaon then boosts to an @xmath201 state , which , when added to the @xmath3 s 1/2 spin , generates @xmath202 and @xmath203 strength , even at low energies , without an explicit 5/2 baryon resonance .",
    "thus , we learn that _ t-_channel , or kaon exchange provides @xmath202 and @xmath203 strength and therefore contributes to the @xmath204 and @xmath205 multipoles . this mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "the as model has particularly strong _",
    "t-_channel couplings , which are generated , in a duality sense , to make up for the absence of the 3/2 resonances contained in the saly model .",
    "the wjc model , which has weaker coupling in the _ t-_channel processes , does ultimately also reveal a similar bifurcation in the @xmath173 observable , but not until higher energies of about 1.4 gev .",
    "although the saly model has stronger _ t-_channel strength than does the wjc model , it does not display the bifurcation one might expect , because it is dominated at low energy by the @xmath63 resonance . for the saly model the above role for _",
    "t-_channel @xmath184 amplitudes is not seen . instead , in fig .  3",
    ", the @xmath173 for saly has a @xmath178 node which travels rapidly toward @xmath55 in the region of the @xmath63 resonances of this model .",
    "this property is related to the resonance - driven evolution of the single node in the observables @xmath177 and @xmath61 for the saly model . in the @xmath173 case ,",
    "the 3/2 resonance increases the size of the @xmath206 term and the rapid variation of @xmath193 with energy and its sign change explain how the 3/2 resonance causes the rapid @xmath207 nodal evolution . at higher energies the saly model does acquire 5/2 strength and thus a nonzero quadratic term , @xmath208 permits the appearance of two nodes , as seen in fig .",
    "thus , all of the @xmath173 curves arise from resonance and/or _ t-_channel mechanisms .",
    "we conclude that the observable @xmath173 provides a particularly sensitive test of resonances and of @xmath184 amplitudes and thereby of _ t-_channel or meson exchange processes .",
    "the basic idea of duality , which equates a sum over all _",
    "t-_channel processes with a sum over all _ s-_channel resonances , shows that there is a close relationship between a dynamical model s content with respect to assumed resonances and the corresponding strength of the _ t-_channel exchanges needed to fit the data .",
    "thus , another way to describe the significance of @xmath173 is that it tests the duality structure of the dynamics .",
    "this result and the enhanced role of @xmath184 amplitudes were not anticipated by fts .",
    "+   * ( b ) beam - target spin observables * + we now discuss the nodal trajectories for the beam - target observables , which are given in the second row of fig .  3 .",
    "for the observable @xmath209 a bifurcation of nodes appears in fig .",
    "recall that @xmath131 is restricted to an even number of nodes by rule * h2*. therefore , if a ( nsc)zero develops in this observable and with increasing energy this vanishing extremum acquires a non zero value , then it must produce two sc nodes : that is what we mean by a bifurcation . insight into this rule",
    "is gained by noting  @xcite that @xmath210 has the form @xmath211 the coefficient @xmath190 is determined by amplitude products of the form @xmath212 and interferences @xmath213 thus @xmath190 can exist either by having a @xmath214 resonance ( as in saly ) or by enhanced _ t-_channel 3/2 strength , without invoking 5/2 terms .",
    "hence , the quadratic form can be realized for those two reasons by all models .",
    "indeed , all models ( fig .  3 ) display a bifurcation at about the same photon energy ; for as and wjc the term c is generated by the kaon exchange process ; whereas , for the saly case it is generated by the underlying 3/2 resonances . there are no nodes in @xmath131 until about 1.2 gev , even though the @xmath215 would seem to allow for low energy nodes . however , the @xmath216 term is dominated by @xmath217 while @xmath193 depends only linearly on @xmath86 s interference with @xmath90 multipoles .",
    "thus , the @xmath216 term dominates and without a sizable contribution from @xmath218 single nodes are prevented and one goes directly to double nodes at higher energies .",
    "the beam - target observable @xmath61 is related to the single spin observable @xmath144 which was discussed in the previous section .",
    "the rapid variation of the nodal location of @xmath61 for the saly model is due to the 3/2 resonance , but in a more dramatic fashion than for @xmath219 see fig .",
    "thus the double spin observable @xmath61 has enhanced 3/2-resonance dependence .",
    "this is another good example of nodal structure generated by resonances .",
    "the relation between the nodal trajectories for @xmath144 and @xmath61 is particularly instructive .",
    "we know that @xmath220 im@xmath221 where the @xmath69 and @xmath222 helicity amplitudes are zero unless @xmath65 amplitudes exist .",
    "thus , in the absence of @xmath65 amplitudes , we recover the theorem @xmath223 of rule * h3*. in the case of the two @xmath63 saly - resonances , the difference between @xmath144 and @xmath61 is determined by im@xmath224 and therefore by the associated amplitudes interference .",
    "the two saly - resonances drive both @xmath144 and @xmath61 in a very revealing manner .",
    "note that for the wjc model there are no @xmath63 resonances and consequently nodes for that case develop at higher energy and move from @xmath178 to smaller angles smoothly for both @xmath144 and @xmath225 this is an example of a non - resonant driven nodal evolution , where the @xmath63 strength probably arises first from _ t-_channel effects .",
    "hence , observation of both @xmath144 and @xmath61 could reveal the presence or absence of resonance dynamics .",
    "one would need to measure the polarization of the final @xmath3 _ via _ its decay and also measure @xmath61 which requires a linearly polarized photon plus a proton target polarized in the @xmath226 direction . in the present case",
    ", we are dealing with two nearby @xmath63 resonances albeit of different parity ; it would be of interest to explore the nature of nodal trajectories for isolated and/or dominant resonances such as are thought to occur in @xmath227 meson production  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath166 we see no nodes until higher energies ( above 1.4 gev ) for all models .",
    "the as develops two nodes , followed by wjc with two nodes and then saly comes on with three nodes in the 1.8 gev region .",
