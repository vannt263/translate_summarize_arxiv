    "the study of quantum degenerate fermions has been in the forefront of research in ultra - cold atoms and molecules in recent years , where particular attention was paid to the so - called evolution from bcs to bec superfluidity .",
    "bringing ultra - cold fermions into quantum degeneracy and using feshbach resonances to tune interactions between colliding fermions opened the door for the exploration of their superfluid phases , and their thermodynamic and correlation properties .",
    "this ability to tune interactions and explore the limits of weak , strong and unitary interactions had impact not only in cold - atom physics , but also in condensed matter physics ( strongly correlated superconductors ) , nuclear physics ( superconductivity in quantum chromodynamics ) and astrophysics ( superfluidity in neutron stars ) .    many advances in cold atoms followed after the development of new tools for their toolbox .",
    "for instance the experimental study of the evolution from bcs to bec superfluidity occurred after appropriate feshbach resonances for @xmath0li and @xmath1k were identified , and used to study the crossover problem for @xmath2-wave superfluids .",
    "in addition to @xmath2-wave feshbach resonances , both @xmath0li and @xmath1k also exhibit @xmath3-wave feshbach resonances , which could produce p - wave superfluids in particular in bec regime if @xmath3-wave feshbach molecules were stable .",
    "unfortunately , such @xmath3-wave molecules do not live sufficiently long for the creation of @xmath3-wave superfluids  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the manipulation of interactions , it has been possible to extract experimentally detailed thermodynamic information of interacting ultra - cold fermions  @xcite from local density images of trapped atoms with the help of the local density approximation  @xcite .",
    "a further tool was developed recently through the production of tunable artificial spin - orbit fields  @xcite that were created in @xmath4rb , a bosonic isotope of rubidium , by using a set of raman beams that allowed momentum transfer and mixing of two dressed spin states . in these experiments",
    ", the emergence of spin - orbit fields , controlled by the momentum transfer from the light fields to the atoms , was connected to the simultaneous existence of an artificial zeeman field controlled by the raman coupling . in such experiments ,",
    "the artificial spin - orbit and zeeman fields were used to manipulate the effective interactions between bosons and thus produce new quantum phases of bosonic matter  @xcite . in a subsequent experiment",
    "it was directly demonstrated that the effective interactions between bosons can acquire higher angular momentum components which are directly controlled by the artificial spin - orbit and zeeman fields .",
    "the effective single - atom hamiltonian created in these experiments is @xmath5 when expressed in the dressed state spin basis @xmath6 .",
    "here , @xmath7 represents the kinetic energy of an atom with momentum @xmath8 and spin state @xmath2 , @xmath9 represents the zeeman field along the quantization axis @xmath10 which is directly related to the raman coupling @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the detuning and @xmath15 represents a mixture of equal rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite terms , which we label as erd spin - orbit coupling .    the possibility of studying similar phenomena with ultra - cold fermions in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman fields  @xcite lead to an explosion of theoretical research , which focused primarily on the case of rashba - only ( ro ) spin - orbit coupling  @xcite which has been studied extensively in condensed matter physics in the context of non - centro - symmetric superconductors  @xcite",
    ". some suggestions of possible realizations of artificial ro spin - orbit fields in ultra - cold fermions have appeared in the literature  @xcite . however , in our group , we have focused mostly on the erd case  @xcite , which is simpler to be realized experimentally as it was demonstrated for interacting bosons  @xcite in the case of @xmath4rb , and more recently for non - interacting fermions such as @xmath1k in china  @xcite and @xmath0li in the united states  @xcite .    in our recent work",
    "@xcite , we emphasized the importance of interactions in producing novel phases for spin - orbit coupled ultra - cold fermions in the presence of zeeman fields , and we analyzed in detail the erd case with a longitudinal zeeman field which is orthogonal to the spin - orbit field  @xcite . in this paper , we generalize our previous analysis to include an additional zeeman field @xmath16 representing the detuning @xmath17 , which is perpendicular to longitudinal zeeman field @xmath18 representing the raman coupling @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", the simultaneous presence of @xmath16 and the erd spin - orbit field @xmath19 along the @xmath20 axis leads to the loss of parity for the eigenvalues of @xmath21 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian - single - atom ] ) above .",
    "this violation of parity in the energy spectrum leads to many detectable parity - violating properties in spectroscopic quantities such as the spectral function and momentum distribution , which are explicitly momentum - dependent , or in momentum - integrated quantities like the density of states when viewed as a function of zeeman fields @xmath16 and @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that this parity violation can also be seen and quantified in thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure , entropy , specific heat , chemical potential , compressibility and spin - polarization , which are discussed in detail for non - interacting ultra - cold fermions in the presence of erd spin - orbit and crossed zeeman fields @xmath16 and @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we also discuss the effects of parity violation when attractive @xmath2-wave interactions are present , and we pay particular attention to the pairing temperature and to the absence of parity in the order parameter tensor describing the superfluid order .",
    "the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : magnetic - hamiltonian ] , we describe the magnetic hamiltonian in its general form , and particularize it to any linear combination of rashba and dresselhaus terms , while in section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] we discuss the independent - atom ( non - interacting ) hamiltonian including both the kinetic energy and the magnetic parts .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the single - atom hamiltonian are discussed in section  [ sec : excitation - spectrum ] , where a generalized helicity basis is introduced and fermi surfaces for various values of crossed zeeman fields are presented .",
    "particular attention is paid to parity violations for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in section  [ sec : spectral - function ] , we show the momentum dependence for the spectral function at fixed frequency revealing the cases of weak and strong parity violations , while in section  [ sec : momentum - distribution ] we describe the the spin - resolved momentum distributions which also reveal parity violations for various values of crossed zeeman fields . in section  [ sec : density - of - states ]",
    ", we analyze the spin - dependent density of states for a few values of the crossed zeeman fields and fixed erd spin - orbit coupling , while in section  [ sec : thermodynamic - properties ] , we define several thermodynamics properties which analyzed in the following sections , such as pressure and entropy in section  [ sec : pressure - entropy ] , chemical potential in section  [ sec : chemical - potential ] , isothermal compressibility in section  [ sec : isothermal - compressibility ] and spin - polarization  [ sec : induced - polarization ] . furthermore , we investigate the effects of parity violation on the effective interactions in section  [ sec : effects - of - interactions ] and on the pairing temperature in section  [ sec : pairing - temperature ] .",
    "lastly , we state our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] emphasizing that several measurements can be made to detect parity violation in both non - interacting and interacting fermi gases in the simultaneous presence of an erd spin - orbit field , and crossed zeeman fields @xmath16 , @xmath22 , where @xmath16 is related to the detuning @xmath17 and @xmath22 to raman coupling @xmath11 .",
    "to describe quantum degenerate fermi systems in the presence of artificial spin - orbit and crossed artificial zeeman fields , we discuss first the type of magnetic hamiltonian to be used . generally speaking the coupling between magnetic fields and two spin - states",

    "this leads to the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath27 although there are many possible forms of fictitious magnetic fields that can be created in the laboratory .",
    "we discuss here a few simpler magnetic field configurations . in principle , the external artificial zeeman field @xmath28 can have three components @xmath29 , in practice , we set @xmath30 , and @xmath31 because in current experimental setups @xmath14 , where @xmath17 is the laser detuning , and @xmath32 , where @xmath11 is the strength of raman coupling field .",
    "in addition , there are many possible types of spin - orbit contributions where @xmath33 can have three components @xmath34 . however , we consider particular forms of spin - orbit fields , which can be more easily realized in practice .",
    "the first type has the dresselhaus form @xmath35 where @xmath36 measures the strength of the dresselhaus field in units of velocity .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian for such field is @xmath37 the second type has the rashba form @xmath38 where @xmath39 measures the strength of the rashba field in units of velocity .",
    "the corresponding rashba hamiltonian is @xmath40 either the dresselhaus or the rashba forms require spin - orbit fields along the @xmath41 and @xmath20 directions , which to be produced experimentally demand two orthogonal raman setups , such that momentum transfer occurs in two perpendicular directions .",
    "a linear combination of two forms leads to the field @xmath42 where the velocities @xmath43 the corresponding hamiltonian for such linear combination is @xmath44 the simplest type of spin - orbit field that can been created in the laboratory has the equal - rashba - dresselhaus ( erd ) form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , or equivalently @xmath48 .",

    "we define the variables @xmath67 and the chemical potentials @xmath68 and notice that @xmath69 plays the role of the average kinetic energy , while @xmath70 plays the role of the parallel zeeman field @xmath71 including the external field @xmath22 and the internal field @xmath72 due to a possible initial population imbalance . in the limit",
    "that there is zero initial population imbalance , the chemical potentials can be set to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while the kinetic energies reduce to @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",

    "a signature of parity violation is the different behavior of any chosen thermodynamic quantity as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath141 and as a function of @xmath22 for @xmath116 .",
    "this anisotropy of thermodynamic properties in the @xmath423 plane for finite spin - orbit coupling @xmath148 is a direct reflection of the lack of parity ( inversion symmetry ) .",
    "lastly , we analyzed the effects of interactions for a degenerate fermi gas when parity is broken , and investigated how parity violation influences the order parameter of a uniform superfluid and the fermion pairing temperature .",
    "we noticed that the order parameter tensor for a uniform superfluid in the generalized helicity basis no longer possesses inversion symmetry , however singlet and triplet pairing in can still be defined this basis and preserves parity .",
    "furthermore , we found that the effects of parity violation are strong in the pairing temperature of fermions , because it becomes increasingly more difficult to pair states with zero center of mass momentum between helicity bands with progressively larger loss of inversion symmetry .",

    "<S> we study quantum degenerate ultra - cold fermi gases in the presence of artificial spin - orbit coupling and crossed zeeman fields . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the case where parity is violated in the excitation spectrum and compare it with the simpler situation where parity is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in detail spectroscopic properties such as the excitation spectrum , the spectral function , momentum distribution and density of states for the cases where parity is preserved or violated . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we show that thermodynamic properties such as pressure , chemical potential , entropy , specific heat , isothermal compressibility and induced spin polarization become anisotropic as a function of zeeman field components , when parity is violated . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we discuss the effects of interactions and present results for the pairing temperature as the precursor for the transition to a superfluid state . in particular , we find that the pairing temperature is dramatically reduced in the weak interaction regime as parity violation gets stronger , and that the momentum dependence of the order parameter for superfluidity violates parity when crossed zeeman fields are present for finite spin - orbit coupling . </S>"
