    "the analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy power spectra @xcite combined with results from large scale structure ( lss ) surveys @xcite strongly suggest that about @xmath4 of the energy in the universe is in an exotic form of matter which we refer to as dark energy ( de ) .",
    "measurements of the luminosity distance to supernova type ia ( snia ) independently confirm these conclusions by showing that high redshift supernovae are dimmer than in a matter dominated universe @xcite",
    ".    further evidence , which has recently become available , is the detection of the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect using the cmb / lss cross - correlation @xcite .",
    "this evidence is complementary in nature to the snia data . rather than probing the overall expansion of the universe",
    ", it detects the slow down in the growth of density perturbations that occurs when the universe ceases to be matter dominated .",
    "cmb photons traveling to us from the surface of last scattering blueshift and redshift as they fall into and climb out of gravitational potentials along their paths . during matter domination ,",
    "the large scale potentials remain constant in time , hence the blueshift and the redshift exactly cancel each other out . however , any deviation from a constant total equation of state results in a time variation of the potentials and a net change in the photon energy .",
    "this is observed as an additional cmb temperature anisotropy , which is the isw effect @xcite .",
    "detecting the isw effect from measurements of cmb temperature anisotropy alone is not feasible because the signal is hard to separate from the primordial anisotropy from the last scattering surface . to circumvent this ,",
    "it was proposed to correlate the cmb temperature maps with the local distribution of matter @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation arises from cmb anisotropies produced after the cosmic structures were formed . on large angular scales",
    "the cross - correlation signal is dominated by the isw effect , while at small angles an additional contribution comes from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath5 is the simplest model of dark energy that provides a satisfactory fit to the existing data . despite the success of the concordance @xmath5 cold dark matter scenario ( @xmath5cdm ) ,",
    "it is difficult to explain why the cosmological constant value is so extremely small compared to the expectations of particle physics without involving anthropic selection @xcite . on the other hand , the observations are also consistent with an evolving dark energy , such as quintessence models where the dark energy originates from a scalar field @xcite . establishing whether the dark energy is constant or evolving is one of the main challenges for modern cosmology . in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe the evolution of dark energy is completely determined by its equation of state , which is defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density : @xmath6 . for scalar field quintessence ,",
    "the sound speed is unity and @xmath1 determines the clustering properties of de . depending on the model @xmath1 can be constant or change with time .",
    "models with @xmath7 correspond to evolving de , while @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath5 .    the time dependence of the dark energy equation has been constrained by fitting various forms of @xmath0 to the snia data , often in combination with cmb and the lss measurements @xcite .",
    "however the data are not accurate enough to distinguish between the cosmological constant and many forms of dynamical dark energy . moreover",
    "degeneracies between dark energy parameters strongly limit the possibility to test whether @xmath1 is constant or not .",
    "as we shall describe in this paper , the cmb / lss correlation can provide another probe of the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the sensitivity of the cross - correlation to the dark energy evolution has previously been investigated in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study constraints expected from correlating surveys such as des and lsst with the cmb data .",
    "we introduce a novel way of parameterizing @xmath0 that has the average @xmath2 ( eq .",
    "( [ def : aver ] ) ) as an explicit parameter .",
    "this helps to separate information contained in the estimate of the distance to last scattering from that in the isw contribution .",
    "we then proceed to show that the cross - correlation , in the absence of errors , is more sensitive to the details of the high redshift evolution of @xmath0 than other available observables .",
    "this sensitivity , however , is off - set by large statistical errors due to a large primordial contribution to the cmb signal .",
    "we forecast the expected uncertainties in de parameters ( using two different models ) extracted from cmb / lss correlation that will be possible in the next five years ( wmap / des ) and in the next ten years ( planck / lsst ) .",
    "we also calculate corresponding constraints from the sne data ( snls in short term and snap in long term ) .",
    "we find that in long term , cross - correlation can provide competitive constraints on the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we discuss the dark energy modeling and the details of the calculations .",
    "section [ sec : exp ] describes the observations considered in the paper . in section [ results ] we discuss some advantages of including the cross correlation information and give the resulting parameter constraints .",
    "finally in section [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "many models of dark energy have been proposed : cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) , quintessence , k - essence , tangled defects , etc . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on quintessence based models where the dark energy arises from a scalar field currently slow - rolling down a potential , which is effectively inflation occurring at late times .",
    "perturbations in the dark energy are easily incorporated in such models , and the sound speed is typically of order the speed of light .    the shape of the potential , which determines the evolution of the dark energy , is generally a free function .",
    "this makes it difficult to predict the time dependence of the de equation of state , so one is potentially left with constraining a completely arbitrary function of redshift .",
    "the problem must be simplified by considering some parameterization of the function @xmath0 .",
    "several parameterizations have been suggested in a vast literature , but any resulting constraints are very sensitive to the choice of parameterization . for instance",
    "it was shown in @xcite that fitting a constant @xmath1 will tend to favor lower negative values if the de equation of state is time dependent .",
    "even two - parameter taylor expansions are too simplistic , resulting in a strong dependence on the assumed priors and generally biased against dynamical models @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular two - parameter formulae is the linear change in the scale factor @xmath9 @xcite given by , w(a)=w_0+(a-1)_w  , [ lin ] [ w : linder ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the value at some early time , such as the radiation - matter equality . from eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) it appears evident that with two parameters one can fix the value of the equation of state today and at high redshift , but the time evolution between the two extremes can not be changed ( i.e. @xmath12 ) . as consequence of this ,",
    "a linear expansion can not allow for rapid variation in the equation of state and particularly in the case of quintessence , for which @xmath13 , this bias will tend to favor small values of @xmath14 . despite these potential problems , eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) has become a common tool of testing the capability of future experiments to constrain de models ( see @xcite ) . due to its wide use in the literature",
    ", we will consider this parameterization here to help the comparison of our results with previous works .",
    "we shall refer to it as model  i.    in order to avoid the pitfalls introduced by the taylor expansion we also consider a phenomenological approach and model @xmath0 according to some minimal requirements , which are : 1 ) the form of @xmath0 depends on a minimal number of parameters which are of simple physical interpretation , 2 ) the parameterization is not biased against any particular time behavior and can account for both rapid ( large ) or slow ( small ) variation of the equation of state , 3 ) the parameterization reproduces the evolution of several proposed models of de such as quintessence . in this regard ,",
    "a general formula constructed to follow these guidelines was proposed in @xcite and is usually referred to as the `` kink '' model @xcite .    within the class of the kink models we consider a unique new parameterization .",
    "we start with the functional form w(z)= +  tanh  , [ def : tanh ] which describes a transition from @xmath15 for @xmath16 , to @xmath17 for @xmath18 , with parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 describing the width and the central redshift of the transition .",
    "the novelty is in using the average equation of state ( @xmath2 ) as an explicit parameter , where @xmath21 is defined as [ def : aver ]  . here",
    "@xmath22 is the scale factor ( @xmath23 today ) , @xmath24 is the scale factor at the surface of last scattering and @xmath25 is the ratio of the de energy density to the critical density .",
    "it is well known @xcite that on small scales the cmb temperature anisotropy spectra are insensitive to the details of @xmath0 except for its average value as defined in eq .",
    "( [ def : aver ] ) . specifying @xmath2 roughly fixes the distance to the last scattering surface @xcite , which determines positions of the acoustic peaks in the cmb temperature anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the cmb temperature data , combined with a prior knowledge of @xmath26 and under the assumption that the universe is flat , is capable of constraining the value of @xmath2 with a very high accuracy . by explicitly specifying @xmath2 we preserve the information that would be obtained from fitting a constant @xmath1 to the cmb , while still allowing for a varying @xmath0 .",
    "hence , a direct control on the value @xmath2 allows us to reduce the four dimensional parameter space to a much smaller observationally allowed region , which corresponds to a narrow range of possible values of @xmath2 .",
    "note that for @xmath2 close to @xmath27 , as favored by the data , most choices of @xmath28 would lead to @xmath0 changing between @xmath27 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "also note that in a large class of quintessence models either @xmath15 or @xmath17 is @xmath27 .",
    "this is the case when the scalar field is initially in a slow - roll regime ( @xmath31 ) as in , , the doomsday model @xcite . similarly for tracker models , where the quintessence field starts tracking",
    "the background component and evolves at late time settling to a minimum of its potential ( i.  e. @xmath32 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , fixing the value of either @xmath17 or @xmath15 to @xmath27 is physically and observationally motivated and allows us to reduce the number of parameters in eq .",
    "( [ def : tanh ] ) from four to three .",
    "thus , instead of using the four parameters of eq .",

    "the cross - correlation becomes useful and can provide an independent constraint @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : alt_comb2_long ] illustrates how a different choice of model ii fiducial parameters affects the constraining capabilities of the different probes .",
    "the alternative model has @xmath167 instead of @xmath168 .",
    "was not modified as the transition time would be pushed to very high redshifts if it approached -1 . on the other hand , @xmath2 smaller than @xmath169",
    "are strongly disfavored by current data .",
    "] in this case we note the snap+planck constraint for @xmath28 is noticeably tighter than that from the planck / lsst correlation .",
    "also note that this is mainly due to improvement in the sensitivity of the sne , as the transition in this model happens at a lower redshfit .",
    "the size of the error on @xmath28 from the cross - correlation is only marginally increased compared to fig .",

    "we have studied the potential of the cmb / lss correlation for constraining the evolution of the de equation of state .",
    "we proposed a new parameterization , a `` kink '' model which has the average equation of state @xmath2 as an explicit parameter .",
    "a direct control on the value of @xmath2 preserves the tight constraints on @xmath1 obtained from the distance to last scattering measurements , while allowing @xmath0 to vary in other ways .    using fisher analysis ,",
    "we have made forecasts of the expected uncertainties in de parameters extracted from the upcoming cmb , sne and cmb / lss correlation data .",
    "we have considered both short- ( wmap , des , snls ) and long- ( planck , lsst , snap ) term prospects .",
    "we find that in long term the cross - correlation will provide competitive constraints on the evolution of @xmath0 , in particular , on the total change in @xmath1 , provided a sufficiently generic parameterization is used .",
    "we also note that the transition length parameter , @xmath19 , will not be well constrained even with the long - term combined data .",
    "our results encourage further investigation of the cmb / lss correlation as a probe of dark energy .",
    "the cross - correlation has a clear weakness  a large variance that hinders its utility as a precision cosmology probe .",
    "however , it also has certain attractive features , that in some cases can out weigh the lack of accuracy .",
    "these features are :    * the cross - correlation probes _ the rate _ of the growth of structure as well as the growth .",
    "* it is practically independent of reionization details ( @xmath92 ) and the details of the initial spectrum ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "* it probes the large scales ( @xmath170 ) , where the evolution of structure is safely inside the linear regime and there is no need for higher order corrections . * on linear scales contributing to the isw / lss correlation",
    "the galaxy bias is expected to be independent of scale .",
    "* cross - correlation is linear in bias , compared to the matter power spectrum that is quadratic . in fact , if one used a cross - correlation estimator that is normalized to the auto - correlations , that estimator would be independent of bias and the overall normalization of the primordial spectrum .",
    "* cross - correlation can probe the evolution of dark energy at relatively high redshifts , inaccessible by luminosity distance measurements .    in this work",
    "we have restricted our attention to quintessence models for which the effective sound speed is of order of unity , so that the dark energy perturbations only affect the evolution of the largest structures . however ,",
    "if the dark energy clusters on smaller scales , it may leave a distinctive signature which can be detected with cross - correlation measurements .",
    "although current data do not provide any constraints on the dark energy sound speed @xcite , the constraints from the next generation of galaxy surveys have been studied in @xcite .",
    "we have only considered flat frw models . without the flatness assumption , cmb constraints on @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "weaken because of a well - known degeneracy @xcite , also relaxing constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "we will explore constraints on de using isw without the flatness prior in a future work .",
    "the model ii type parameterization of @xmath0 considered in the paper is not necessarily the most optimal for underscoring the power of cross - correlation constraints ( although clearly better suited for this purposed than model i ) .",
    "a more comprehensive study using a principal component approach @xcite is a subject of ongoing research .",
    "another potential use of the isw cross - correlation is to measure the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and indirectly constrain the amplitude of the tensor modes when combined with the normalization of cmb spectra @xcite .",
    "this is because the distribution of the large scale structures is not correlated with a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "it has been also suggested @xcite that cmb / lss studies may help to differentiate between quintessence and models with modified gravity .    for a fixed total number of galaxies the information extracted from the isw studies depends on the choice of the redshift binning .",
    "the role of cross - correlation in constraining @xmath0 may be further increased by optimizing the bin selection .",
