    "the data files were then fourier transformed to facilitate a search for objects with periodic signatures .",
    "the folded lightcurves of targets with significant peaks in their ffts were then examined by eye to look for unusual objects with periodic features . unfolded and normalized light curves for targets lacking significant peaks in their ffts were also examined by eye to look for aperiodic or quasi - periodic signatures .",
    "one object that stood out was epic 212651213 ( hereafter ` e1213 ' ) which exhibited eclipses with a 5-day period , but where the folded light curve also showed the presence of eclipses that did not fit this period . the raw light curve",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawlc ] and the two nearly equal eclipses of the 5-day orbital period are readily apparent .",
    "however , there is also another set of unequally spaced , more shallow eclipses whose locations are marked in the figure with short vertical red lines to guide the eye .",
    "these correspond to a different eclipsing eccentric binary with a 13-day period .",
    "we also noticed that the target epic 212651234 ( hereafter ` e1234 ' ) exhibited the same two sets of eclipses , but with reduced amplitudes . the sdss image of the sky in the vicinity of these two targets ( see fig .",

    "we were able to tentatively conclude that the source of _ both _ eclipsing binary signals is , in fact , e1213 .",

    "the folded data used for the subtraction was produced while eliminating the phases around the other binary s eclipses .",

    "[ fig : folds ] ) , hereafter designated as ` binary a ' , has two nearly equal depth eclipses that are separated by very close to half an orbital cycle .",
    "the fitted fractional separation between eclipses differs by only @xmath9 ppm from half an orbital cycle , and we can then utilize the approximate expression ( good to 2nd order in eccentricity @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 \\label{eqn : ecom}\\ ] ] to say that @xmath12 , which is indicative of a rather circular orbit unless the longitude of periastron , @xmath13 , for the binary is within @xmath3@xmath14 of @xmath15 or @xmath16 . in this expression @xmath17",

    "having established the basic properties of binaries ` a ' and ` b ' , we can now consider them as likely bound members of a higher - order binary ( i.e. , a quadruple star system ) which we call ` c ' .",
    "we know three quantitative things about the ` c ' binary : ( 1 ) the relative radial velocity of ` a ' relative to ` b ' is @xmath30 10.6 km s@xmath4 as inferred from the difference in @xmath31 and @xmath32 , hereafter ` @xmath33 ' .",

    "( 3 ) the relative radial acceleration of the two binaries with respect to each other is constrained to be @xmath37 cm s@xmath38 based on limits to @xmath39 for the ` a ' and ` b ' binaries ( see table [ tbl : cbinary ] ) .",
    "we can use these three facts to set some interesting constraints on the orbital period and inclination of the ` c ' binary following the approach used in lehmann et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for the case of the quadruple system kic 7177553 .    because we have only ( i ) the relative radial velocity between the two binaries , @xmath33 , ( ii ) a value for the projected physical separation , @xmath40 , and ( iii ) an upper limit on the relative radial acceleration of the two binaries , we consider only the simple case of a circular orbit for the ` c ' binary as being illustrative .",
    "these three quantities are related to the unknown orbital radius , @xmath41 , inclination , @xmath42 , and phase , @xmath43 by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total system mass ( i.e. , the combined masses of binaries ` a ' and ` b ' ) . note that @xmath43 is taken here to be zero at the time of superior conjunction , which is 90@xmath46 from the definition used by lehmann et al .",

    "for each realization of the system we choose a random inclination angle with respect to an isotropic set of orientations of the orbital angular momentum vector of the ` c ' binary .",
    "in addition , because there is an uncertainty in the determination of @xmath49 ( see tables[tbl : abinary ] and [ tbl : bbinary ] ) , and a significant uncertainty in the projected orbital separation , @xmath40 ( due largely to the uncertainty in distance to the target ) , we also choose specific realizations for those two quantities using a gaussian random draw for both @xmath49 and @xmath40 .",
    "we then solve eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ac ] ) for @xmath41 , and we also store the corresponding value of @xmath42 . finally , we restrict the inferred value of @xmath41 so as to yield a value for the radial acceleration ( see eqn .",

    "we repeat this process @xmath50 times to produce our distributions of @xmath41 , @xmath51 and @xmath42 .",

    "the corresponding orbital separation is @xmath54 au . according to the orbital inclination angle distribution ,",
    "values of @xmath55 are strongly favored ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : per_dist ] ) .",
    "such orbital periods are sufficiently short that the prospects for near - term detections of the accelerated motions of binaries ` a ' and ` b ' are highly promising .    given that the projected separation of binaries ` a ' and ` b ' on the sky is very similar ( within the uncertainties ) to the peak value of @xmath41 in the distribution of orbital separation ( see fig .",

    "this would not change the conclusions reached here in a material way except to increase the uncertainties .",
    "a sketch of the ` c ' binary is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the outer orbit of binary ` a ' around binary ` b ' is drawn to scale , and the orbit is assumed circular .",
    "the orbits of stars 1 and 2 in the circular binary ` a ' and stars 3 and 4 in eccentric binary ` b ' are drawn to the correct shape and size relative to each other ; however , their absolute size has been artificially scaled up by a factor of @xmath320 so that the orbits can be resolved .    since we are likely viewing binary ` c ' with large inclination angles and @xmath58 , we can reduce eqns .",

    "future rv and high - resolution imaging observations of this object should readily achieve accuracies of 1.5 mas in terms of the angular separation of binaries ` a ' and ` b ' , and 1 km s@xmath4 for the rv measurements . solving for the orbital phase changes required to make a detection of orbital motion in binary ` c ' we find @xmath63 and 0.07 orbital cycles for the high - resolution imaging and the rv observations , respectively .",
    "these orbital phase advances correspond to @xmath32 and 4.5 years , respectively .",
    "thus , we advocate further rv and high - resolution imaging of this object starting a couple of years from now .",
    "the three facts we have to work with concerning the relationship between objects e1213 ( comprised of a quadruple star system ) and e1234 ( which appears single both in imaging and spectroscopy ) , are the following .",
    "first , the projected separation of the two stars is @xmath64 on the sky . for a distance of about 260 pc",
    ", this corresponds to a projected physical separation of about 2800 au or 0.013 pc .",
    "this is well within the allowed separation for stars to remain bound pairs without being tidally disrupted in their passage around the galaxy ( jiang & tremaine 2010 ) .",
    "second , the radial velocity of the center of mass of the ` c ' binary ( actually a quadruple system ) is @xmath65 km s@xmath4 while the radial velocity of e1234 is -15.0 km s@xmath4 , both with an uncertainty of @xmath31 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these are suggestively close to having the same value .",
    "third , the magnitude of the difference in the two proper motion vectors is only @xmath66 mas yr@xmath4 .",
    "combining these three facts leads to the quite plausible , even highly likely , notion that e1213 and e1234 are themselves a gravitationally bound binary pair .",
    "we refer to this as the ` d ' binary .",
    "the angular , velocity , and time scales are too long to hope to see any changes in this binary over the next decades .",
    "the rms scatter of the rvs for e1234 within the combined tres and ko sets is @xmath3100 m s@xmath4 , while for the tls observations by themselves , the rms scatter is similar ( see table [ tbl : rvd ] ) .",
    "however , there is a systematic offset between these two sets of @xmath3900 m s@xmath4 .",
    "if we subtract off that constant offset from the three tls rv measurements of e1234 , the overall rms spread in the rv measurements remains at 100 m s@xmath4 .",
    "we are unable to account for the systematic shift between observatories , which has minimal effect on the evaluation of the orbital parameters in binaries ` a ' and ` b ' . however , for estimating an upper limit to the projected radial acceleration of a possible binary in e1234 this discrepancy matters , and we adopt an rms radial velocity of 100 m s@xmath4 for this purpose . in turn",
    ", this yields an upper limit to the projected radial acceleration of @xmath30.003 cm sec@xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the angular separation of any internal stellar pairs is @xmath67 based on the ao and speckle imaging ( see sect .  [ sec : ao ] ) .",
    "the limits on angular separation and projected radial accelerations suggest that any binary stellar pair within e1234 has a physical separation , @xmath68 constrained by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the orbital inclination angle and phase , respectively , of any hypothetical binary in e1234 ( as in eqns .",
    "8 and 10 ) .",
    "here we have assumed a total binary mass of @xmath72 .    interestingly ,",
    "unless the orbital phase or inclination angle are somewhat finely tuned , the above constraints already suggest that any putative binary in e1234 must have an orbital separation not too far from @xmath316 au .",
    "if it is much wider it would have been resolved with ao or speckle imaging , and if much closer the acceleration ( i.e. , change in @xmath2 velocity ) would likely have been detected over the 72-day interval of the rv measurements .    to push this argument a bit further , we took advantage of tres s 15 m s@xmath4 instrumental stability .",
    "relative rvs were derived by cross - correlating each observed spectrum , order - by - order , against the strongest observed spectrum over the wavelength range 0.435 - 0.628 @xmath73 m .",
    "these yield significantly tighter constraints on _ changes _ in velocity over the course of the observations than the absolute velocities given in table [ tbl : rvd ] . with these multi - order velocities",
    ", we can set a limit of @xmath74 30 m s@xmath4 on the constancy of the radial velocity for e1234 . in turn , this lower limit increases the coefficient on the left side of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : e1234 ] ) to a value of @xmath335 .",
    "this constraint effectively eliminates nearly all viable solutions for the semi - major axis of any putative circular binary .",
    "all this is in keeping with our assertion that image e1234 is that of a single star .",
    "finally , we note that if the location of star e1234 in the @xmath75 is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yy ] , it is significantly evolved , and would have a mass of @xmath76 and an age @xmath77 gyr .",
    "if we take e1213 and e1234 to be coeval , this sets the same lower limit to the age of the two binaries in e1213 .",
    "we have presented an unusual quintuple star system consisting of 5 stars arranged as a hierarchical quadruple orbited by a single star .",
    "the k2 data show that both binaries comprising the quadruple are eclipsing ( fig .",
    "[ fig : folds ] ) .",
    "we have measured the spectroscopic orbits of 3 of the 4 stars in the two binaries ( fig .  [",
    "fig : rvs ] ) .",
    "the 5-day binary is highly circular , while the 13-day binary is eccentric with @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rvs ] and tables [ tbl : abinary ] and [ tbl : bbinary ] ) .",
    "the separation of the two binaries is resolved by both keck ao imaging and wiyn speckle interferometry at 90 mas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ao ] ) .",
    "the flux ratio of the two binaries was thereby measured quite accurately at four different wavelengths with the ao and speckle imaging ( table [ tbl : ratios ] ) . by combining the three measured mass functions with the flux ratio of binary ` b ' to ` a ' , and utilizing stellar evolution models , we have managed to extract reasonably accurate stellar parameters for all four stars in the two binaries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] ) .",
    "we have shown that if the rv and/or high - resolution imaging of this object are repeated 2 - 3 years from now , there is a good chance that changes in the motion of binary ` a ' with respect to binary ` b ' ( i.e. , within the binary ` c ' system ) will be detected .",
    "additionally , in regard to detecting motion within the ` c ' binary , we note that the eclipses of binary ` a ' are deep enough to easily follow from ground - based observations . if the eclipses can be tracked with an accuracy of minutes , then we should be able to detect significant eclipse timing variations within a few years .",
    "this is physically equivalent to measuring @xmath79 via rv observations .",
    "after analyzing and evaluating the quadruple system e1213 , we argued that the stellar image e1234 is itself a single star ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : e1234 ] ) , and is very likely bound to the quadruple system ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : dbinary ] ) .",
    "this system is one of only a relative handful of known quadruple or higher multiplicity stellar systems where the radial velocities have been measured for both binaries , and where , additionally , both binaries are eclipsing .",
