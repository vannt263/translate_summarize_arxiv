    "coherent control of photons is nowadays one of the central topics in quantum optics and quantum information processing .",
    "usually , the photons are confined in small volumes  @xcite of cavities with low dissipation , in order to promote their controllability and enhance their interaction with matters such as atoms . besides , it is convenient to couple the cavities each other to form controllable quantum network  @xcite and construct quantum device .",
    "for example , the coupled - cavity array with doped defects can be used to realize the single - photon transistor or router  @xcite , and the system can also be applied to simulate the quantum phase transition in strong correlated systems  @xcite .    in recent years , the coherent control of photons in a simple system of two coupled cavities ( that is , an optical molecule  @xcite ) , has invoked a lot of research interests , including for example , the photon blockade  xw , hs , jl , state transfer  @xcite , non - equilibrium dynamics  @xcite , coherent polariton  @xcite , and unidirectional photonic transport  lc , bp .",
    "however these above works appear in the systems of optical molecules with the assistance of some nonlinear interactions , such as the kerr interaction .",
    "it naturally inspires us to investigate the photonic control in the optical - molecule system up to only the linear terms in the effective interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we study the coherent control of mean photon numbers in the cavities of an optical molecule when it reaches its steady state .",
    "in such a system , one can construct a closed cyclic diagram for the energy levels ( e.g. , the lowest three energy ones ) with the inter - cavity coupling and two classical fields which drive the two cavities respectively .",
    "and the phase difference between the two driving fields serves as a sensitive controller for physical phenomenon . due to the quantum interference effect",
    ", we show that the partially dark optical molecule can be realized : the steady - state mean photon number of any of the two cavities can be zero ( i.e. , the cavity is dark since it achieves its steady vacuum state without considering the vacuum fluctuation ) even under external driving .",
    "furthermore , the dark cavity can be modified from one cavity to the other by only adjusting the phase difference , which can be easily controlled in experiments .",
    "furthermore , we consider the case of adding an ensemble of identical atoms to interact with one of the cavities of the optical molecule . by means of the bosonization process of the low atomic collective excitations  collectiveexcitation , we keep effectively only the linear effects of atom - cavity interaction and obtain analytically the steady - state values of the photon numbers in the cavities .",
    "similar to the situation without atomic ensemble , we can also prepare the partially dark optical molecule with zero mean photon number in either of the cavities by tuning the phase difference between the two driving fields .",
    "moreover , compared with the case without atoms , the condition for the cavity which couples to the atomic ensemble is not changed but that for the other cavity is significantly modified .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ he ] , we present the hamiltonian and the steady - state values of the photon numbers in the cavities of the optical - molecule system .",

    "we discuss in sec .",
    "ha the realization of partially dark optical molecule in the situation where one of the cavities is coupled with an ensemble of identical atoms .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in sec .",
    "the optical - molecule system under consideration is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) . the two single - mode cavities couple to each other , and the hamiltonian can be written as ( here and after @xmath0 ) @xmath1where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the annihilation operator of cavity mode @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) with resonance frequency @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the coupling strength between the two cavity modes .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a pair of external classical field with the same frequency @xmath8 to drive the two cavities respectively .",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the driving strength for the cavities respectively and @xmath13 is the phase difference of the two driving fields , which can be tuned freely in the regime @xmath14 . in the rotating frame with respect to the driving frequency @xmath8 ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath15where @xmath16 is the detuning between the cavity 1 ( 2 ) and the driving field .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be described by the heisenberg - langevin equation ( neglecting the fluctuations ) @xmath17where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20with @xmath21 being the decay rate of cavity mode 1 ( 2 ) .",
    "the steady - state values of the system are given by @xmath22where @xmath23        it is obvious that the phase difference @xmath13 plays a significant role in controlling the photon numbers in the two cavities . the phase dependent dynamics is ascribed to the quantum interference effect with different transition paths . as shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme](b ) , the diving field of strength @xmath9 induces the transitions latexmath:[$|0,0\\rangle",
    "\\rightarrow    latexmath:[$|0,1\\rangle \\rightarrow    @xmath11 induces the transitions @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 representing @xmath28 photons in cavity 1 and @xmath29 photons in cavity 2 .",
    "meanwhile , the direct inter - cavity coupling @xmath30 induces the transitions @xmath31 ( for example , see the states in the dashed rectangle frame for the case of @xmath32 ) and the relative total phase of the loop @xmath33 will essentially influence the steady state of the system .",
    "however , when any of the driving fields is shut down , the closed transition disappears and the phase difference @xmath13 will take no effect in controlling the average photon numbers in the cavities .",
    "this fact can also be observed in eqs .",
    "( [ a1]-[c2 ] ) , which show that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent of the phase difference @xmath36 when @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "actually , the similar closed cyclic energy - level diagram can also be found in many other systems , such as superconducting artificial atom  @xcite , chiral molecule chiralmolecule , chiralmolecule2 , cavity - qed system  @xcite , and cavity optomechanical system  @xcite , in which the phase control to quantum phenomenon has attracted much attention .    in fig .",

    "it is interesting that , even in the presence of the driving fields , we can still achieve the regime in which @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "it implies that we can realize the partially dark optical molecule , i.e. , one of the cavities will stabilize in its vacuum state , and thus will be named as dark cavity in the following .",

    ", we will give the conditions for realizing such a partially dark optical molecule .",
    "first , we seek the conditions for the average photon number of the cavity mode 1 being zero ( @xmath45 ) . as shown in eqs .",

    "[ n1n2 ] , when the parameters are set such that @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , we can transfer the dark cavity from cavity 1 to cavity 2 only by adjusting the phase difference adiabatically while keeping the other parameters unchanged , which is available in realistic physical systems .    here",
    ", we emphasize that the two cavities of the optical molecule can not stabilize in their vacuum states simultaneously ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) .",
    "this can be observed from eqs .",
    "( [ phi1],[phi2 ] ) , which imply @xmath57 when @xmath45 and @xmath58 when @xmath59 .",
    "thus one can not achieve @xmath60 in this case . intuitively speaking",
    ", this contradiction may be expected to disappear in the system with balanced loss and gain in which @xmath61  @xcite",
    ". however , further calculation shows @xmath62 in such a situation if eqs .",
    "( [ phi1]-[co2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "that means there does not exist the steady state in the system . in what follows",
    ", we will just consider the damping case with @xmath63 .",
    "based on the above discussions about the realization of partially dark optical molecule in the last section , here we continue to study the effects of atom - cavity interaction in the system . to this end",

    "we analytically give the conditions to realize the partially dark molecule ( that is one of the cavity modes achieves its vacuum steady state ) .",
    "moreover , when an additional ensemble of two - level atoms is coupled with one of the cavities ( e.g. cavity 1 ) , analytical calculation showed that the optical molecule can be still partially dark . _",
