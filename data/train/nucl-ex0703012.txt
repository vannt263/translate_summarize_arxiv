    "our knowledge of neutrinos from the sun is based on seven experiments : homestake , kamiokande , sage , gallex , gno , super - kamiokande and sno .",
    "more than half of these are radiochemical experiments .",
    "the detection of neutrinos by use of the inverse @xmath9 decay reaction was proposed 60 years ago by bruno pontecorvo @xcite .",
    "this method of detection , which is the basis for radiochemical experiments , has played a fundamental role in solar neutrino investigation .",
    "the idea to use neutrino capture in @xmath10cl to observe the `` undetectable '' new particle proposed by wolfgang pauli was brilliantly realized to observe solar neutrinos by r. davis and collaborators in the world - famous experiment at the homestake gold mine @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10cl experiment was built 4200  m.w.e .",
    "( meters of water equivalent ) underground and began to collect data in 1967 . between 19701994 , 108 extractions of ar were made from a tank that contained 615  tons of c@xmath11cl@xmath12 .",
    "the number of @xmath10ar atoms collected in each run was measured in a miniature proportional counter .",
    "the result for the first measured capture rate of solar neutrinos at the earth was @xmath13  snu .",
    "the snu unit ( defined as 1 neutrino capture per day in a target that contains @xmath14 atoms of the neutrino - absorbing isotope ) was specially introduced by john bahcall , who had a fundamental role in the funding of the cl experiment and the interpretation of its results , and whose contributions can not be overestimated .",
    "bahcall was the first to fully develop a solar model that included all the physical parameters needed to calculate the solar neutrino flux at the earth .",
    "he worked tirelessly to refine his calculations and it was the robustness of his solar model that eventually led all people to understand the significance of the discrepancy between the result of the cl experiment and standard solar model ( ssm ) predictions .",
    "the discrepancy identified in the cl experiment attracted the attention of a significant number of scientists and it soon became known as `` the solar neutrino problem '' .",
    "this problem continued to bother the mind of scientists for more than 30  years .",
    "especially important was the confirmation of the discrepancy by the kamiokande experiment @xcite , a real - time detector of solar neutrinos that used a completely different method of detection  electron scattering , and which began to collect data in 1987 . as a result there were no doubts that the flux of neutrinos in the high - energy part of the solar neutrino spectrum was significantly less than the calculations of the ssm .",
    "kamiokande , with an analysis threshold of 7  mev , was sensitive only to the high - energy @xmath15b neutrinos and the cl experiment , whose major response was from the superallowed analog state at an excitation energy of 5.0  mev in @xmath10ar , was also mostly sensitive to the @xmath15b neutrinos .",
    "another significant development during this time was the confirmation of the results of the bahcall ssm by a solar model independently developed by sylvaine turck - chize and collaborators @xcite .    despite many attempts ,",
    "the combination of these two experiments could not be explained on the basis of solar physics ; rather , many scientists began to believe that it was necessary to reject some of our old ideas about neutrino properties and to develop new ones .",
    "conclusive evidence for this suggestion could be obtained by measuring the low - energy part of the solar neutrino spectrum , which is produced in reactions that provide the vast majority of the sun s energy , and whose flux can be well predicted from the measured solar luminosity combined with a simple solar model .",
    "the need for experiments sensitive to low - energy solar neutrinos was recognized shortly after the first results from the cl experiment were announced and many people began to consider radiochemical experiments with low - energy sensitivity , such as those shown in table  [ irvine_table ] .    @",

    "because of its high capture rate , low energy threshold of 233  kev and favorable half - life of 11.4  days , a ga experiment appeared to be a most attractive possibility .",
    "the main problems with the ga experiment were the acquisition of several tens of tons of the expensive element gallium and the development of a nearly lossless procedure for the extraction and purification of @xmath8ge .",
    "laboratory research to develop a gallium experiment began approximately in 1975 . in the united states this work took place at brookhaven national laboratory under the direction of ray davis with participation of b.  cleveland , j.  evans , g.  friedlander , k.  rowley , r.  stoener from brookhaven , and w.  frati and k.  lande from the university of pennsylvania @xcite .",
    "methods were developed to extract germanium from liquid gallium metal and from a gacl@xmath23 solution .",
    "after a few years , this group achieved success in development of these methods and chose the method based on gacl@xmath23 solution . to carry out the experiment a collaboration was initiated with a group from the max planck institute at heidelberg . despite repeated requests and favorable reviews , the ga experiment was , however , not funded in the united states .",
    "rather , a special subcommittee of the nuclear science advisory committee recommended that interested scientists associate themselves with groups in western europe and/or the soviet union .",
    "the western european group , called gallex , had been formed by the heidelberg group under the direction of till kirsten when it became apparent that the experiment would not be funded in the us .    in the soviet union , at the institute for nuclear research , laboratory investigations to develop a gallium experiment began about the same time in 1975 .",
    "it was initially based on a gacl@xmath23 solution , but when it was learned that soviet industry could not provide the necessary radioactive purity in 50  tons of solution , the project was changed to gallium metal . using davis s idea , the extraction of minute quantities of @xmath8ge from many tons of metallic gallium was independently developed .",
    "one advantage of metallic ga is that it is significantly less sensitive to radioactive impurities . in 1980",
    "an installation was built that contained 300  kg of ga metal .",
    "in addition to testing the technology , this work also yielded a new limit on the law of conservation of electric charge @xcite . by 1985",
    "a pilot installation containing 7.5  tons of metallic gallium had been constructed at troitsk .",
    "the soviet group built their experiment at the baksan neutrino observatory in the caucasus mountains .",
    "the first ga exposure began in december 1989 and data collection has continued since that time .",
    "gallex built their experiment at the gran sasso tunnel in italy and collected data from 1991 - 1997 . in 1998",
    "they were reconstituted as the gallium neutrino observatory ( gno ) and they continued operation until 2003 @xcite .",
    "in 1986 the soviet - american collaboration sage was officially established to carry out the gallium solar neutrino experiment at the baksan neutrino observatory .",
    "the experiment is situated in a specially built deep underground laboratory where the measured muon flux is @xmath24(@xmath5 s ) .",
    "it is located 3.5  km from the entrance of a horizontal adit excavated into the side of a mountain .",
    "the rock gives an overhead shielding equivalent to 4700  m of water and reduces the muon flux by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "the mass of gallium used in sage at the present time is about 50  tonnes .",
    "it is in the form of liquid metal and is contained in 7 chemical reactors .",
    "a measurement of the solar neutrino capture rate begins by adding to the gallium a stable ge carrier .",
    "the carrier is a ga - ge alloy with a known ge content of approximately @xmath26 g and is distributed equally among all reactors .",
    "the reactor contents are stirred thoroughly to disperse the ge throughout the ga mass .",
    "after a typical exposure interval of four weeks , the ge carrier and @xmath8ge atoms produced by solar neutrinos and background sources are chemically extracted from the ga using procedures described in @xcite .",
    "the final step of the chemical procedure is the synthesis of germane ( geh@xmath12 ) , which is used as the proportional counter fill gas with an admixture of ( 9095)% xe .",
    "the total efficiency of extraction is the ratio of mass of ge in the germane to the mass of initial ge carrier and is typically @xmath27 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in this efficiency is 3.4% , mainly arising from uncertainties in the mass of added and extracted carrier .",
    "the proportional counter is placed in the well of a nai detector that is within a large passive shield and is counted for a typical period of 46 months .    based on criteria described in @xcite , a group of events",
    "is selected from each extraction that are candidate @xmath8ge decays .",
    "these events are fit to a maximum likelihood function @xcite , assuming that they originate from an unknown but constant - rate background and the exponentially decaying rate of @xmath8ge .",
    "a single run result has little significance because of its large statistical uncertainty .",
    "the global best fit capture rate for all sage data from january 1990 through december 2005 ( 139 runs and 264 separate counting sets ) is @xmath28  snu , where the uncertainty is statistical only . if one considers the @xmath29-peak and @xmath30-peak data separately , the results are @xmath31  snu and @xmath32  snu , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the two peaks serves as a strong check on the robustness of the event selection criteria .",
    "the systematic effects fall into three main categories : those associated with extraction efficiency , with counting efficiency and with backgrounds . for a complete description of these effects",
    "see @xcite .",
    "including all uncertainties , our overall result is @xmath33  snu .",
    "if we combine the sage statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature , the result is @xmath34  snu .",
    "the final result from 123 runs in the gallex and gno experiments is @xmath35  snu @xcite .",
    "the weighted combination of all the ga experiments , sage , gallex and gno , is thus @xmath36    it was very good that for many years there were two ga experiments operating at the same time and it is indeed unfortunate that the gno experiment was terminated for non - scientific reasons .",
    "the experimental procedures of both ga experiments , including the chemical extraction , counting and analysis techniques , have been checked by exposing the gallium target to reactor - produced neutrino sources whose activity was close to 1  mci .",
    "gallex has twice used @xmath37cr sources to irradiate their entire target ; sage has irradiated about 25% of their target with a @xmath37cr source and an @xmath10ar source @xcite .",
    "the results , expressed as the ratio @xmath38 of the measured @xmath8ge production rate to that expected due to the source strength , are shown in figure  [ src_res ] .",
    "the weighted average value of the ratio for the four experiments is @xmath39 , more than two standard deviations less than unity .    since other auxiliary tests , especially the @xmath8as experiment of gallex ,",
    "have given great confidence in the knowledge of the various efficiencies in the ga experiments , the combined result of these source tests should not be considered to be a measurement of the entire throughput of the ga experiments .",
    "rather , we believe that , although not statistically conclusive , the combination of these experiments suggests that the predicted rates may be overestimated .",
    "the most likely hypothesis is that the cross sections for neutrino capture to the lowest two excited states in @xmath8ge , both of which can be reached using either @xmath37cr or @xmath10ar sources , have been overestimated @xcite .",
    "if the contribution of these two excited states to the predicted rate is set to zero , then @xmath40 , reasonably consistent with unity . a new experiment with a considerably higher rate from the neutrino source",
    "is needed to settle this question .",
    "[ src_res ]    as a side note , during the time of the sage @xmath10ar source experiment , which used 26  tonnes of ga , solar neutrino extractions were also made from the remaining 22  tonnes of ga .",
    "since the sage counting system was filled with samples from the @xmath10ar source , we transported the @xmath8ge extracted from the solar runs to gran sasso , where geh@xmath12 was synthesized and the samples were counted in the gno counting system .",
    "the combined result of six such solar runs was @xmath41  snu @xcite , in excellent agreement with the overall result of the ga experiments .",
    "the capture rate @xmath42 of component @xmath43 of the solar neutrino spectrum is given in a radiochemical experiment by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the amplitude of the flux from this solar component at the production point in the sun , @xmath46 is the integral over the solar spectrum of the probability of survival of the electron neutrino during its travel from where it is produced in the sun to where it is detected at the earth , and @xmath47 is the integral of the cross section for neutrino capture over the spectrum at the earth .",
    "the physical origin for the reduction of the electron component of the solar neutrino flux is the now well - established mechanism of msw neutrino oscillations @xcite .",

    "all of which is due to neutrinos of medium energy .",
    "we assume the sun is generating its energy via the @xmath3 cycle so these medium - energy neutrinos are dominated by @xmath22be .",

    "the major component of the error in this @xmath3 flux measurement is due to the poor knowledge of the medium - energy neutrinos which was inferred from the cl experiment .    for comparison ,",
    "the standard solar model calculates the @xmath3 flux produced in the sun to be @xmath108/(@xmath5-s ) @xcite .",

    "the dominant error should eventually be due to the inaccuracy of the ga measurement itself .",

    "<S> radiochemical experiments have been crucial to solar neutrino research . even today </S>",
    "<S> , they provide the only direct measurement of the rate of the proton - proton fusion reaction , @xmath0 , which generates most of the sun s energy . </S>",
    "<S> we first give a little history of radiochemical solar neutrino experiments with emphasis on the gallium experiment sage  the only currently operating detector of this type . </S>",
    "<S> the combined result of all data from the ga experiments is a capture rate of @xmath1  snu . for comparison to theory </S>",
    "<S> , we use the calculated flux at the sun from a standard solar model , take into account neutrino propagation from the sun to the earth and the results of neutrino source experiments with ga , and obtain @xmath2  snu . using the data from all solar neutrino experiments we calculate an electron neutrino @xmath3 flux of @xmath4/(@xmath5-s ) , which agrees well with the prediction from a detailed solar model of @xmath6/(@xmath5-s ) . </S>",
    "<S> four tests of the ga experiments have been carried out with very intense reactor - produced neutrino sources and the ratio of observed to calculated rates is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> one explanation for this unexpectedly low result is that the cross section for neutrino capture by the two lowest - lying excited states in @xmath8ge has been overestimated . </S>",
    "<S> we end with consideration of possible time variation in the ga experiments and an enumeration of other possible radiochemical experiments that might have been . </S>"
