    "it is very well known that diffusion - limited binary reactions in low dimensions exhibit `` anomalous '' rate laws , that is , rate laws that deviate from the quadratic forms that usually characterize binary reactions .",
    "it is also known that these anomalies occur because diffusion is not an effective mixing mechanism , especially in constrained geometries , whereas the quadratic rate laws assume perfect mixing .",
    "the shortcomings of diffusion as a mixing process lead to the spontaneous occurrence of spatial order and spatial structures in terms of which the anomalous rate laws are well understood  @xcite . broadly speaking , spatial order leads to a slowing down of the reaction because it tends to decrease or deplete the interfacial areas where reactions can occur .    the anomalies exhibit themselves in different ways according to the design of the experiment , and the critical dimension above which the behavior of the reaction is `` normal '' also varies from one experiment to another .",
    "thus , for example , in an irreversible batch reaction @xmath0 , the decay of reactant concentrations deviates from ( is slower than ) the mean field behavior @xmath3 up to dimension @xmath4 .",
    "this anomaly is accompanied by and directly associated with a sharp segregation of species as the majority species in any region eliminates the minority species and diffusion is too slow to replenish the minority population effectively . if there are random sources of reactants so that the system achieves a steady state , species segregation is observed in the steady state up to dimension @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "one of the more accessible experimental setups to observe these anomalies is that of a reaction front in which initially one reactant uniformly occupies all the space to one side of a sharp front , and the other reactant occupies the other  @xcite . as the reaction proceeds , one can monitor the concentration profiles of both reactants and of the product .",
    "their evolution reflect the anomalies . for the reaction - diffusion case",
    "the front evolution has been extensively studied theoretically and confirmed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "our interest lies in understanding binary reaction kinetics in media where the reactants move _",
    "subdiffusively_. subdiffusive motion is particularly important in the context of complex systems such as glassy and disordered materials , in which pathways are constrained for geometric or for energetic reasons .",
    "it is also particularly germane to the way in which experiments in low dimensions have to be carried out .",
    "such experiments must avoid any active or convective or advective mixing so as to ensure that any mixing is only a consequence of diffusion . to accomplish this",
    "usually requires the use of gel substrates and/or highly constrained geometries ( the first gel - free experiments were carried out recently  @xcite ) . under these circumstances",
    "it is not clear whether the motion of the species is actually diffusive , or if it is in fact _",
    "subdiffusive_. indeed ,",
    "a recent detailed discussion on ways to extract accurate parameters and exponents from such experiments concludes that at least the experiments presented in that work , carried out in a gel , reflect subdiffusive rather than diffusive motion  @xcite .",
    "subdiffusive motion is characterized by a mean square displacement that varies sublinearly with time , @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "for ordinary diffusion @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the ordinary diffusion coefficient .",
    "subdiffusion is not modeled in a universal way in the literature . among the more successful approaches to the subdiffusion problem",
    "have been continuous time random walks with non - poissonian waiting time distributions  @xcite , and fractional dynamics approaches in which the ordinary diffusion operator is replaced by a generalized _ fractional _ diffusion operator  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two has also been discussed . in particular , the fractional dynamics formulation that leads to the mean square displacement  ( [ meansquaredispl ] ) can be associated with a continuous time random walk with a waiting time distribution between steps which at long times behaves as @xmath10 in our work we adopt the fractional dynamics approach .",
    "since subdiffusion is an even poorer mixing mechanism than ordinary diffusion , we expect that the diffusive anomalies observed in constrained geometries will in some sense be exacerbated in a subdiffusive environment .",
    "however , the outcome is not entirely clear or predictable . on the one hand , slower motion naturally leads to a slowing down of the reaction . on the other",
    ", slower motion also delays the elimination of the minority species in a region , and therefore may reduce the spatial segregation effects observed in the diffusive case .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the time dependence of the front geometry , and , in particular , on the exponents that describe the evolution of a number of quantities that define the reaction front .",
    "we expect there to be anomalies that differ from those of the diffusive problem . in sec .  [ evolution ]",
    "we formulate our model and present our scaling solutions . in sec .",

    "we start with a system of @xmath11 particles on one side and @xmath12 particles on the other of a sharp linear front , defined to lie perpendicular to the @xmath13 axis .",
    "the particles diffuse and react with a given probability upon encounter . a standard mean - field model for the evolution of the concentrations @xmath14 and @xmath15 of @xmath11 and @xmath12 particles along @xmath13",
    "is given by the reaction - diffusion equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient assumed to be equal for the two species .",
    "the initial conditions are that @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . with these conditions ,",
    "no matter the dimensionality of the system , the system of equations is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the front problem was first analyzed via a scaling description  @xcite and later refined by a large number of authors using more rigorous theoretical and careful numerical approaches ( see references in yuste _",
    "et al . _",
    "one upshot of the extensive work is that @xmath5 is a critical dimension for the mean field description to be appropriate .",
    "below @xmath5 one must take into account fluctuations , neglected in this description , that completely change the outcome of the analysis . while it has been assumed that the mean field model holds for the critical dimensions @xmath5 , krapivsky  @xcite finds logarithmic corrections that have also been observed in simulations  @xcite .",
    "our program is to generalize the mean field description to the subdiffusive case and to apply a scaling description to the problem .",
    "one can show that @xmath5 is also the critical dimension for the subdiffusive problem .",
    "our work is therefore not appropriate for systems of dimension lower than two ( we do not consider logarithmic corrections ) .    in order to generalize the reaction - diffusion problem to reaction - subdiffusion , we must deal with the subdiffusive motion of the particles ( generalization of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ difmft ] ) ) and with their reaction rate law ( second term ) .",
    "we discuss each separately .    in the fractional diffusion approach to subdiffusive motion one",

    "as the reaction proceeds , a depletion zone develops around the front .",
    "this is the region where the concentrations of reactants are significantly smaller than their initial values .",
    "how the width @xmath32 evolves with time is one of the measures typically used to characterize the process . within this depletion zone",
    "lies the so - called reaction zone , the region where the concentration @xmath33 of the product @xmath34 is appreciable .",
    "this concentration profile has a width @xmath35 whose variation with time is another characteristic of the evolving reaction .",
    "the evolution of the production rate of @xmath34 ( which determines the height of the profile of @xmath33 in the reaction zone ) is a third measure of the process . to find these time dependences we adapt the original scaling approach  @xcite to the subdiffusive case , and assume the scaling forms @xmath36 for the concentrations and @xmath37 for the reaction term .",
    "the exponents @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are to be determined from three relations .",
    "the scaling forms are only valid for @xmath41 , that is , well within the depletion zone .    two of the three relations needed to fix the scaling exponents do not require further specification of the reaction term . since the reaction zone increases more slowly than the width of the depletion zone ( an assumption that ex post turns out to be correct ) , we can focus on the concentration difference @xmath42 to deduce the width of the latter .",
    "the reaction term drops out when one subtracts the equations in eq .",
    "( [ subdifmft ] ) , and its form therefore does not matter at this point . generalizing the procedure of glfi  @xcite , one can scale the resulting equation by measuring concentrations in units of @xmath43 , time in units of @xmath44 , and length in units of @xmath45 , so that the equation is simply @xmath46 and the only control parameter is @xmath47 in the initial condition : @xmath48 the solution is @xmath49 , \\label{ctperiodica}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the fox h - function  @xcite .",

    "@xmath54    the second relation follows from the fact that the concentration gradient of @xmath11 and @xmath12 leads to a flux of particles toward the reaction region .",

    "there is a varied literature on this subject , based on a number of different assumptions  @xcite .",
    "most do not associate a memory with the reaction term .",
    "some assume that , as in the case of ordinary diffusion , reactions can simply be modeled by a space - dependent form of the law of mass action , e.g. , by setting @xmath66",
    ". some of these assumptions may be appropriate if the reaction is very rapid , but not if many encounters between reactants are required for the reaction to occur .",
    "we adopt the viewpoint put forth in a recent theory developed for geminate recombination  @xcite but , as the authors themselves point out , much more broadly applicable .",
    "this theory goes back to the continuous time random walk picture from which the fractional diffusion equation can be obtained , and considers _ both _ the motion and the reaction in this framework .",
    "in the context of geminate recombination the authors define a reaction zone and argue that a geminate pair within the reaction zone will not necessarily react for any finite intrinsic reaction rate ( which they call @xmath67 ) because one of the particles may leave the zone before a reaction takes place .",
    "the dynamics of leaving the reaction zone is ruled by the waiting time distribution @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the waiting time that regulates the rest of the dynamics [ cf .",
    "eq .  ( [ waitingtime ] ) ] , and therefore the reaction rate will acquire a memory that arises from the same source as the memory associated with the subdiffusive motion . in the continuum limit this model then leads to a reaction - subdiffusion equation in which both contributions have a memory .",
