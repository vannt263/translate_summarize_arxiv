    "recent observational studies have been found strong clustering in two - point angular correlation function ( acf ) of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath9 , ( e.g. @xcite ) , red galaxies at @xmath10 @xcite , and ly@xmath11 emitters ( laes ; @xcite ) at @xmath12 . even at @xmath13 , there is a piece of evidence for filamentary large ( 100 mpc)-scale structures of laes @xcite .",
    "the distribution of high-@xmath14 galaxies is fairly inhomogeneous and highly biased against matter distribution predicted by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "the estimated bias is @xmath15 , depending on luminosity / type and redshift of galaxies .",
    "however , the shape of the acf for high-@xmath14 galaxies is not well constrained .",
    "@xcite report a @xmath16 excess of the acf at @xmath17 for @xmath18 lbgs , while @xcite found a possible deficit of the acf at @xmath19 for bright lbgs which they interpret as the halo exclusion effect on hosting halos with a mass of @xmath20 .    in the local universe",
    ", the correlation function shows a departure from a power law ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the departure is reproduced in the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) and the related halo models in the cdm cosmology @xcite , and is explained by two sources contributing to the correlation function ; one for galaxy pairs residing in the same halo ( 1-halo term ) and the other for galaxies hosted by different halos ( 2-halo term ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hod has been also applied to clustering of galaxies at high-@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , parameters of the models have not been constrained with similar accuracy as at low-@xmath14 because of the small sample ( @xmath21 galaxies ) and surveyed area ( @xmath22deg@xmath1 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present acf of @xmath0 lbgs with unprecedented statistical quality , on the basis of 16,920 lbgs obtained in the 1 deg@xmath1 sky of subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ; @xcite ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system , and we adopt @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 and @xmath25=[0.3,0.7,1.0,0.9]$ ] . to facilitate comparison with previous results , we express @xmath26 using @xmath27 , the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 .",
    "we carried out deep optical broad - band imaging with subaru / suprime - cam in the 1 deg@xmath1 sky of the sxdf .",
    "our broad - band images reach @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 with a @xmath33-diameter circular aperture at the @xmath16 level ( furusawa et al . in preparation ) .",
    "typical seeing sizes ( fwhm ) of these images are @xmath34 .",
    "we use the @xmath35-band selected source catalog of the sxds @xmath36 produced with sextractor @xcite , which is composed of 0.7 million objects with @xmath2 .",
    "we select lbgs at @xmath37 on the basis of the color criteria of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , which were determined with the results of spectroscopy and monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we visually inspect all the candidates and mask areas contaminated with halos of bright stars and ccd blooming .",
    "our final catalog includes 16,920 lbgs in a 1.00 deg@xmath1 area ( table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dist_brilbg ] shows the sky distribution of our lbgs .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up observations show that 60 out of 63 identified candidates are real lbgs at @xmath41 ; i.e. , 17 out of 17 and 43 out of 46 are lbgs in the sxdf ( akiyama m. in preparation ) and in the subaru deep field , respectively , where the latter lbg sample is made with the same color criteria as ours @xcite .",
    "thus , the contamination rate of our lbg sample is estimated to be @xmath42% .",
    "we derive the acf , @xmath43 , by the formula of @xcite with random samples composed of 200,000 sources , and estimate bootstrap errors @xcite .",
    "since clustering properties of our 5% contaminants are not clear , we do not apply a correction for contaminants with the assumption of random distribution ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . however , this correction changes @xmath43 and bias only by @xmath44% or less .",
    "figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_all ] presents the acf of lbgs ( top panel ) , residuals of a power - law fit ( middle panel ) , and galaxy - dark matter bias ( bottom panel ) defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the acf predicted by the non - linear model of @xcite . in the top and middle panels of figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_all ] the acf of lbgs shows a significant excess on small scale , and indicates that a power law , @xmath47 , does not fit the data .",
    "this is the definitive identification of the departure from a power law for the acf of lbgs at @xmath0 . with a visual inspection , we confirm that all close - pairs of lbgs are not false detections .",
    "we also plot histogram of galaxy sizes for lbg pairs .",
    "we find that most of our lbgs have fwhm@xmath48 for pairs with any separations down to , at least , @xmath49 , and that extended lbgs do not boost small - scale acf by producing false pairs .",
    "uncertainties in source deblending and photometry can hardly account for the small - scale excess at @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , a similar small - scale excess of acf for @xmath51 lbgs is also found by a recent study on high - resolution ( @xmath52 ) hst images @xcite . comparing our acf with the one of dark matter",
    ", we find that the small - scale excess extends up to @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath53 mpc , which is comparable to virial radius , @xmath54 , of dark halos with a mass of @xmath4 ( see the ticks in the top panel of figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_all ] ) , where @xmath54 is a sphere of radius within which the mean enclosed density is 200 times the mean cosmic value @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the large - scale average bias at @xmath55 is estimated to be @xmath56 which is also comparable to linear bias of dark halos with a mass of @xmath4 ( @xmath57 ) predicted by the cdm ( @xcite ; see the ticks in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_all ] ) .",
    "this coincidence of the dark - halo mass strongly supports that typical @xmath0 lbgs reside in dark halos with a mass of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , these pieces of evidence suggest that multiple lbgs occupy a single dark halo",
    ". the middle panel of figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_all ] also plots residuals of a power - law fit for local galaxies @xcite , which is comparable to those of @xmath0 lbgs on large scale , but significantly larger than lbgs on intermediate scale ( @xmath58 mpc ) corresponding to the radius of @xmath59 dark halos . according to the halo mass function @xcite , the ratio of galaxy - sized halos ( @xmath60 ) to group / cluster - sized halos ( @xmath61 ) is about 10 times higher in number density at @xmath0 than at @xmath62 .",
    "this relative deficit of group / cluster - sized halos at high-@xmath14 would be the cause of the clearer break between small and large - scale acfs at @xmath0 than @xmath62 .",
    "although multiple occupation of lbgs explains very consistently both the angular scale of transition and the amplitude of large - scale bias , there remains the possibility that the small - scale excess is enhanced or produced by brightening of pair galaxies due to interactions .",
    "we calculate @xmath43 and @xmath63 for six subsamples with limiting magnitudes of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ( figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_cumulative ] ) .",
    "we define the large- and small - scale biases as the biases in the range @xmath55 ( @xmath70 mpc ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath71 mpc ) , respectively , and show the biases in figure [ fig : mag_bias_z4 ] .",
    "although the angular range for the small - scale bias is somewhat arbitrary , the range defined here is beyond the internal structures of galaxies and below the radii of dark halos with @xmath72 , and thus is sensitive to a multiplicity of lbgs in a halo .",
    "luminosity segregation of large - scale clustering is reported for @xmath0 lbgs @xcite . in figures [ fig : acorr_brilbg_cumulative ] and [ fig : mag_bias_z4 ] , we find that acfs and biases monotonically decrease from @xmath64 to @xmath73 on small scale as well as large scale .",
    "interestingly , figure [ fig : mag_bias_z4 ] shows that the small - scale bias has a stronger dependence on luminosity ( @xmath74 ) than the large - scale bias ( @xmath75 ) , and the bottom panels of figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_cumulative ] indicate that outskirts of small - scale excess extend to @xmath76 for bright ( @xmath77 ) lbgs .",
    "all the features of luminosity dependence suggest that bright lbgs reside in more massive dark halos , since massive dark halos have not only a high large - scale bias , but also a high small - scale bias ( i.e. high probability of pair galaxies in a massive halo ) and an extended outskirt of bias due to a large halo size .",
    "although the acfs depart from a power law , we approximate the acfs with a power law , in order to compare our results with previous results .",
    "we fit the acf over @xmath78 with @xmath79 , where ic is the integral constraint @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mag_bias_z4 ] presents the best - fit slopes , @xmath80 , as a function of magnitude .",
    "the slopes , @xmath80 , become flatter at faint magnitudes ( see also @xcite ) . this luminosity dependence of @xmath80",
    "is explained by the strong luminosity dependence of small - scale clustering as discussed above .",
    "then we calculate the limber equation with the redshift distribution function of @xcite , and estimate the correlation lengths , @xmath26 , of spatial two - point correlation function , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "table [ tab : results ] presents the best - fit parameters , @xmath83 and @xmath80 , together with @xmath26 .",
    "these @xmath26 are consistent with those obtained by @xcite as well as by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , our results are not consistent with those of small - sky surveys in hdf , if we assume that acf does not significantly evolve between @xmath10 and 4 . for examples ,",
    "@xcite find a small correlation length of @xmath84 mpc for @xmath10 lbgs , while we find a larger value , @xmath85 mpc , for our @xmath2 lbgs whose number density is comparable to that of @xcite .",
    "we restrict our power - law fitting to the same narrow range as @xcite ( @xmath86 ) , and then we obtain the consistent results within errors , i.e. @xmath87 mpc and @xmath88 , due to the fitting only to the small - scale excess of the acf ( see @xcite ) . similarly , the correlation length of red galaxies in hdf - s ( @xmath89 mpc ; @xcite ) is probably overestimated by the extrapolation from a bump of small - scale acf with a relatively flat slope of @xmath90 , which is also claimed by the model of @xcite .",
    "we fit the halo model of @xcite to the observed @xmath43 and number density , @xmath91 , simultaneously .",
    "this model predicts the @xmath43 and @xmath91 of galaxies contributed by a combination of the 1-halo and 2-halo terms in the framework of the cdm model .",
    "the best - fit models are shown in figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_cumulative ] and table [ tab : results ] .",
    "these models account for the overall shape of our acfs , i.e. , the small - scale excess as well as the large - scale clustering ( see also @xcite ) , although there remain large residuals ( e.g. @xmath92 for @xmath2 lbgs ) . reducing these residuals results in a decrease in the combined likelihood ( @xmath43 @xmath93 @xmath91 ) from the best - fit value .",
    "the large residuals imply that we need a more precise model for our lbgs . for implications of the model fitting ,",
    "table [ tab : results ] summarizes the average number of lbgs in a halo , @xmath94 , and the average masses of the halo , @xmath95 , @xcite for the best - fit models .",
    "the average mass of hosting halos monotonically decreases from @xmath96 ( @xmath64 ) to @xmath97 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the average number of lbgs in a halo is less than unity , @xmath98 , while the model acf in figure [ fig : acorr_brilbg_cumulative ] shows a significant 1-halo term produced by multiple lbgs in one halo .",
    "this implies that majority of halos with an average mass have no lbg and only some halos host one or multiple lbg(s ) .",
