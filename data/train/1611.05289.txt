    "the increasing need to analyze the large dimension data in spatial modeling highlights the necessity of having suitable and efficient routines to perform the spatial data analysis . for this and other reasons , researchers have been motivated to create many r packages that contain routines and functions that facilitate the computation of the standard procedures and the new theory developed in spatial statistics .",
    "examples of commonly used packages in spatial analysis and geostatistics are @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "a complete set of r functions developed in the context of spatial econometrics can be found in @xcite .    in the analysis of spatial data ,",
    "the quantification of spatial associations between two variables is an important issue , and considerable effort has been devoted to the construction of appropriate coefficients and tests for the association between two correlated variables .",
    "one can approach this issue by removing the spatial association among the observations and then applying existing techniques that have been developed for independent variables . an alternative way to manage",
    "the problem is to consider approaches that allow one to take into account the autocorrelation structure of the data .    here , we describe a new r package that adds techniques to assess the spatial association between the two processes defined on a finite subset of the plane / real line .",
    "the techniques implemented in the package consist of two coefficients of association introduced by tjstheim and matheron , respectively @xcite and one hypothesis testing procedure studied by @xcite .",
    "these three techniques tackle the spatial association between the two sequences defined in the same locations on the plane and are part of the standard procedures used to analyze the relationship between two spatial variables .",
    "applications of these methodologies in several different disciplines can be found in @xcite and @xcite . although these methods are part of the existing techniques to assess the spatial association between two spatial variables , they are still considered in current research @xcite .",
    "tjstheim s coefficient is a nonparametric coefficient constructed from the ranks of suitable transformations of the coordinates for which both processes are defined .",
    "matheron s coefficient is also known as the codispersion coefficient and is a measurement of association that depends on a distance lag @xmath0 .",
    "the codispersion coefficient is a normalization of the widely used cross - variogram and shares several properties with the correlation coefficient ; however , the difference between the two coefficients relies on the fact that the codispersion coefficient is not centered by the process means . instead , the coefficient quantifies the expected value of the cross - product between observations that are separated by a distance @xmath0 . in this sense ,",
    "the correlation coefficient is a crude measurement of spatial association because it does not depend on a given direction @xmath0 on the plane .",
    "the hypothesis testing described in @xcite is based on a modified version of the correlation coefficient , which can be applied to regular or irregular grids .",
    "three functions were developed to compute the procedures described above : ` cor.spatial ` , ` codisp ` , and ` modified.ttest ` .",
    "all of the basic routines were built in ` c ` for efficiency and then properly linked to r. examples with real and simulated datasets are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the techniques implemented in the package . under specific correlation structures between and across two spatial processes , a monte carlo simulation study was conducted to explore the computational time as a function of the sample size .",
    "two examples with real data are discussed to illustrate practical applications .",
    "the first example demonstrates the well - known murray smelter site dataset in which the variables of interest are arsenic ( as ) and lead ( pb ) , both defined on a non - regular grid on the plane .",
    "the second example relates to the flammability of polymers previously studied by @xcite .",
    "our analysis provides a more complete discussion about the similarity of four images used in the previous study .",
    "a brief discussion about comovement in time series , including a real data example is presented .",
    "the construction of a new graphical tool called codispersion map @xcite is outlined in the discussion .",

    "applications introduced illustrate how the spatial association between the two spatial sequences can be analyzed in a number of different fields and contexts including time series . here , to emphasize that the codispersion coefficient provides information about the direction",
    "for which the highest and lowest values are attained , we show a codispersion map , a graphical display of the codispersion coefficient computed for all values of the points belonging to a grid on the plane . the codispersion map is constructed computing the method of moment estimator ( [ eq : codisp ] ) . as an example , for the murray smelter site dataset discussed in example 2 , a codispersion map is shown in figure [ codismap ] for a circular grid that considers distances up to 3000 meters ( the code can be found in * ? ? ?",
