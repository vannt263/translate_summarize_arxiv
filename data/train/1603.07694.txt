    "the precision astronomical observations in the last couple of decades predicted the existence of massive compact objects . a number of compact objects with very high densities are discovered in the recent times @xcite . to describe such compact objects general theory of relativity",
    "is most useful .",
    "the theoretical investigation of such compact astrophysical objects has been a key issue in relativistic astrophysics over a couple of decades .",
    "astrophysical objects with perfect fluid necessarily requires the pressure inside is isotropic @xcite . in general , a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) is used widely to describe a white dwarf or a less compact star @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical understanding in the last couple of decades made it clear that there is a deviation from local isotropy in the interior pressure . at very high enough densities with smaller radial size the anisotropic pressure plays an important role in determining stellar properties @xcite .",
    "the physical situations where anisotropic pressure may be relevant are very diverse for a compact stellar object @xcite . by anisotropic pressure we mean the radial component of the pressure ( @xmath5 ) different from that of the tangential pressure @xmath6 .",
    "after the seminal work of bowers and liang @xcite , a number of literature appeared considering an anisotropic spherically symmetric static general relativistic object . @xcite and @xcite theoretically investigated compact objects and observed that a star with matter density ( @xmath7 ) , where the nuclear interaction become relativistic in nature , are likely to be anisotropic .",
    "it is further noted that anisotropy in fluid pressure in a star may originate due to number of processes e.g. , the existence of a solid core , the presence of type 3a super fluid etc . @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite determined the maximum mass and mass to radius ratio of a compact isotropic relativistic star .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite examined spherical distribution of anisotropic matter in the framework of general relativity and derived a number of solutions to understand the interior of such stars . a handful number of exact interior solutions in general relativity for both the isotropic and the anisotropic compact objects have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed 127 published solutions out of which they found that only 16 of the published results satisfy all the conditions for a physically viable stellar model . in the case of a compact stellar object",
    "it is essential to satisfy all the conditions outlined by delgaty and lake as the eos of the fluid of the compact dense object is not known .",
    "the discovery of compact stellar objects , such as x - ray pulsars , namely her x1 , millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 , x - ray sources , 4u 1820 - 30 and 4u 1728 - 34 are important and interesting as these are considered to be probable strange star candidates .",
    "the existence of such characteristics compact objects led to critical studies of stellar configurations @xcite .",
    "however , the equation of state ( eos ) of matter inside a superdense strange star at present is not known . in this context @xcite and @xcite",
    "have shown that in the absence of definite information about the eos of matter content of stellar configuration , an alternative approach of prescribing a suitable _ ansatz _ for the geometry of the interior physical 3-space of the configuration leads to simple easily accessible physically viable models of such stars .",
    "relativistic models of superdense stars based on different solutions of einstein s field equations obtained by vaidya - tikekar approach of assigning different geometries with physical 3-spaces of such objects are reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a class of relativistic static non - singular analytic solutions in isotropic form with a spherically symmetric distribution of matter in a static space time .",
    "pant and sah solution is found to lead to a physically viable causal model of neutron star with a maximum mass of @xmath8 .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained a class of compact stellar models using pant and sah solution in the case of spherically symmetric space time . in this paper",
    "we obtain a class of new relativistic solutions which accommodate anisotropic stars possessing mass relevant for neutron stars .",
    "usually a stellar model is obtained using einstein field equation for a known eos and then the geometry of the space - time is determined . in this paper we follow an alternative approach ( synge approach ) by first making an _ ad hoc _ choice of the geometry and then explore the eos for matter .",
    "a class of new relativistic solutions are discussed here which accommodate anisotropic star in hydrostatic equilibrium having mass and radius relevant for neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we set up the relevant field equations and its solutions . in section 3 ,",
    "physical properties of anisotropic star is presented . in sec . 4",
    ", we present physical analysis of stellar models with the observational stellar mass for different model parameters .",
    "finally in sec 5 , we give a brief discussion .",
    "the einstein s field equation is @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the metric tensor , ricci scalar , ricci tensor and energy momentum tensor respectively .",
    "we use spherically symmetric space time metric given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unknown metric functions and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume an anisotropic pressure distribution for the fluid content of the star .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for such fluid in equilibrium is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy - density , @xmath5 is the radial pressure , @xmath6 is the tangential pressure and @xmath19 is the measure of pressure anisotropy @xcite . using the space time metric given by eq.(2 ) ,",
    "the einstein s field eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to the following equations : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 using eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) along with the definition of anisotropy of fluid we obtain @xmath23 eq . ( 7 ) is a second - order differential equation which admits a class of new solution with anisotropic fluid distribution given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it may be pointed out here that @xmath26 corresponds to a solution for isotropic stellar model obtained by @xcite .",
    "we consider here non - zero @xmath4 to obtain an anisotropic stellar model in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "eq.(8 ) permits a relation amongst the parameters which is useful for obtaining stellar models .",
    "the allowed values of the parameters are determined using the physical conditions imposed on the stellar solution for a viable stellar model .",
    "the geometry of the 3-space in the above metric is given by @xmath27 it corresponds to a 3 sphere immersed in a 4-dimensional euclidean space . accordingly",
    "the geometry of physical space obtained at the @xmath28 section of the space time is given by @xmath29 @xmath30.\\ ] ] the pressure anisotropy term becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the geometry of 3 - space obtained at @xmath28 section of the space time metric ( 11 ) given above incorporates a deviation in a spherical 3 space , @xmath1 is a geometrical parameter measuring inhomogeneity of the physical space and @xmath4 is related to the anisotropy . for @xmath33 and @xmath26 , the space time metric ( 11 ) degenerates into that of einstein s static universe which is filled with matter of uniform density .",
    "the solution obtained by pant and sah corresponds to the case when @xmath26 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it reduces to a generalization of the buchdahl solution , the physical 3-space associated with which has the same feature .",
    "however , for @xmath35 , the solution corresponds to finite boundary models . in this paper",
    "we study physical properties of compact objects filled with anisotropic fluid ( @xmath36 ) and determine the values of @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a viable stellar model as permitted by the field equation .",

    "this form of the schwarzschild metric will be used here to match at the boundary with the interior metric given by eq . ( 11 ) at the boundary .",
    "the solution given by eq.(8 ) is useful to study physical features of compact objects with anisotropy in a general way which are outlined as follows :    \\(1 ) in this model , a positive central density @xmath18 is obtained for @xmath43 .",

    "we determine @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 which satisfy the criteria for a viable stellar model outlined above .",
