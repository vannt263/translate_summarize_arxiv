    "the qcd phase diagram is notoriously difficult to compute .",
    "firstly the physics associated with deconfinement or chiral symmetry restoration is strongly coupled where we traditionally do not know how to compute .",
    "secondly at finite density lattice gauge theory , the first principles simulation of the theory on supercomputers , suffers a `` sign problem '' that means monte carlo methods break down .",
    "in fact with light quarks there is no clear order parameter for deconfinement so we will concentrate on the chiral transition .",
    "progress has been made by identifying effective theories of the transitions and through lattice computations at low density .",
    "@xcite provides a review of the standard picture .",
    "it is believed for qcd , with the physical quark masses , that the phase transition with temperature is a smooth cross over ( becoming a second order transition as the up and down quark masses go to zero ) . at zero temperature",
    "the transition with density is believed to be first order .",
    "there must therefore be a critical point where the first order line ends in the temperature density plane .    in the last ten years the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite and more general gauge / gravity dualities have emerged as a new tool for the study of strongly coupled problems .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether these holographic models can in principle describe a phase diagram like that of real qcd .",
    "one recent attempt in this direction can be found in @xcite where a 5d holographic model of a strongly coupled gauge theory with a running coupling was shown to give an appropriate looking phase diagram . in that model",
    "the order parameter is associated with confinement and it does not include quark fields . in true qcd",
    "the order parameter across the phase diagram is the quark bilinear condensate . in this paper",
    "we will study a holographic model of quark fields and again attempt to reproduce key features of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "quarks can be introduced into the ads / cft correspondence through probe branes @xcite and a number of systems with chiral symmetry breaking have been developed @xcite .",
    "we can not of course describe true qcd holographically because the dual , if it exists , is not known and is probably very complicated ( and strongly coupled , at least , in the uv ) .",
    "our analysis is therefore in the spirit of ads / qcd @xcite , a phenomenological modeling of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "if one could model the phase diagram correctly one might hope to then predict other features of the theory such as time dependent dynamics during transitions and so forth .",
    "our models will be in the context of the simplest brane construction of a 3 + 1d gauge theory with quarks which is the d3/d7 system of fig [ 73b ] @xcite .",
    "the basic gauge theory is large @xmath0 , @xmath1 super yang - mills with @xmath2 quark fields .",
    "we will work in the quenched approximation where we neglect quark loops . on the gauge theory side we do not backreact the d7 branes , that provide the quarks , on the geometry but instead work in the probe approximation @xcite .",
    "the theory has a @xmath3 symmetry under which a fermionic quark anti - quark condensate has charge 2 and plays the role of @xmath3 axial @xcite .",
    "although the theory does not have a non - abelian chiral symmetry ( as for example the sakai sugimoto model does @xcite ) this is not important in the quenched approximation since the dynamics of the formation of the quark condensate is flavour independent .",
    "the model is very simple to work with having a background geometry that is just ads@xmath4 and the gauge theory is 3 + 1d at all energy scales .",
    "so called top down models of this type exist with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "supergravity solutions exist that correspond to the ads space being deformed in reaction to a running coupling introduced by a non - trivial dilaton profile @xcite .",
    "in cases where the coupling grows in the infra - red ( ir ) , breaking the conformal symmetry , chiral symmetry breaking is induced .",
    "these models have very specific forms for the running coupling and are typically singular somewhere in the interior . at the string theory level",
    "a full interpretation is lacking .",
    "a yet simpler and completely computable case with chiral symmetry breaking is provided by introducing a background magnetic field associated with @xmath3 baryon number @xcite .",
    "such a background source can be described by a gauge field on the surface of the d7 brane .",
    "a chiral condensate is induced .",
    "very simplistically one can think of the @xmath5-field as introducing a scale that breaks the conformal symmetry as the strong coupling scale @xmath6 does in qcd allowing the strong dynamics to form the quark condensate .    in recent papers @xcite",
    "we have explored the phase structure of the theory with magnetic field .",
    "temperature can be introduced through an ads schwarzschild black hole in the geometry @xcite . density and chemical potential can be added through the temporal component of the @xmath3 baryon number gauge field @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram @xcite is shown in fig [ tvsmu ] .",
    "the chiral restoration transition was found to be first order with temperature and second order with density .",
    "a critical point lies between these regimes .",
    "in addition there is an extra transition associated with the formation of density and the mesons of the system melting into the background plasma @xcite . in places in phase space",
    "this merges with the chiral transition but in other places it separates and can be either first or second order .",
    "such a phase with a quark density but chiral symmetry breaking could potentially exist in qcd .",
    "it would be nice to also describe this transition as a deconfinement transition but firstly the @xmath1 background does not induce linear confinement and secondly the presence of any temperature leads to screening of the quarks at the length scale of the inverse temperature .",
    "the meson bound states are closer in spirit to atomic bound states than qcd - like mesons .",
    "nevertheless they are being disrupted by the background plasma so the existence of a phase with melted mesons but chiral symmetry breaking at least leads one to speculate on a possible separation of deconfinement and chiral restoration behaviour in the qcd phase plane .    in the gravity picture of the transitions",
    "the crucial transitions are between the three sorts of d7 brane embedding shown in fig [ tvsmu ] .",
    "an embedding that curves in the holographic space to miss the black hole represents the chiral symmetry breaking phase .",
    "these solutions have stable and discrete linearized fluctuations that correspond to the mesons of the theory .",
    "the second type of embedding curves off axis but ends on the black hole .",
    "it describes a phase with chiral symmetry breaking but the linearized fluctuations are now replaced by in - falling quasi - normal modes of the black hole which describe unstable mesonic fluctuations of a quark plasma .",
    "finally the flat embedding ending on the black hole describes melted mesons and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the transitions occur when the magnitude of the d7 action for these different cases cross .",
    "how generic to the holographic description is this phase structure ?",
    "keeping within the top down analysis one can change parameters and see what effect they have on the phase diagram .",
    "for example in @xcite we traded density for an electric field parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the electric field tries to dissociate mesons by accelerating the quark and anti - quark in opposite directions and so opposes the formation of a chiral condensate .",
    "the phase diagram of the theory in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane at fixed @xmath5 is also shown in fig [ tvse ] . the chiral transitions are again first order with temperature but second order with density although there is some change in the meson melting transition order due to the wz term contribution @xcite . ] .",
    "we followed up this analysis in @xcite to consider the case of mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields - there the chiral transition is first order in nature throughout the full @xmath7-@xmath8 plane .",
    "a recent paper @xcite performed a simliar analysis with a running dilaton geometry .",
    "the geometry is that of @xcite in which there is a non - zero profile for both the dilaton and axion fields in ads .",
    "the field theory is the @xmath1 gauge theory with a vev for both tr@xmath9 and tr@xmath10 which preserves supersymmetry at zero temperature but displays confinement .",
    "a d7 was introduced in a supersymmetry breaking fashion and chiral symmetry breaking is observed .",
    "the temperature density chiral transformation was first order throughout the plane and is shown in fig [ dilax ] .",
    "it shows the same three phases as the magnetic field case .",
    "an extra component of the analysis in @xcite was to note that in the confining geometry with a running dilaton a baryonic phase was also present .",
    "a baryon vertex is described by a d5 brane wrapped on the @xmath11 of the ads@xmath12 space . in the pure @xmath1 theory",
    "such vertices shrink to zero .",
    "however in the running dilaton geometry the large ir value of the dilaton stabilizes the d5 embedding .",
    "solutions exist that link the d5 to the d7 brane embedding with a balancing force condition .",
    "these configurations describe the gauge theory with finite baryon density rather than finite quark density .",
    "this phase sets in at finite chemical potential and then persists to infinite chemical potential ( as shown in fig [ dilax ] ) which is certainly unlike qcd .",
    "we will not focus on this phase in this paper but it would be interesting to study it in future work to find models that have a baryonic phase in some intermediate range of chemical potential like qcd .",
    "these phase structures are very interesting and surprisingly complex but do not match the expectations in qcd . in qcd",
    "we need a second order transition with temperature and a first order transition with density to the chirally symmetric phase .    here",
    "we want to work in a much more generic framework to ask what phase structures it is possible to get in the holographic description and to try to force ourselves onto a representation of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "we will therefore take a bottom up approach within the model and allow ourselves to dial the running of the gauge coupling by hand .",
    "we will have a dilaton profile that smoothly transitions from a uv conformal regime to an ir conformal regime through a step of variable height and width .",
    "such an ansatz allows one to consider runnings that range from precocious growth in the ir to more walking like dynamics@xcite .",
    "we used a similar ansatz in previous papers to study the impact of walking @xcite on meson physics and as a mechanism for generating inflation @xcite . here , in a completely new analysis of the phase structure of these models , we find that with the simple step ansatz we can move from a totally first order transition in the phase plane to a configuration similar to that we obtained with a @xmath5 field ( a first order transition with temperature but second order with density ) . with this ansatz we can not achieve a second order transition with temperature .",
    "the model directly suggests other phenomenological generalizations though .",
    "in particular , if we think of the running dilaton profile as a short cut for including the back reaction due to the quark fields / d7 brane , then it is natural to break the @xmath13 symmetry of ads@xmath14 in the dilaton in the same fashion as the d3/d7 system s geometry .",
    "this allows us an extra phenomenological freedom to distort the dilaton or black hole horizon .",
    "these simple changes do allow us to reproduce a wide range of phase diagrams including qcd - like ones as we will show below .",
    "we will discuss the simple geometric reasons for the emergence of first or second order transitions in these different scenarios .",
    "our conclusion therefore is that the holographic model has no intrinsic problem with mimicking the qcd phase diagram and these systems may therefore be phenomenologically useful in the future .",
    "first let us review the gravity dual description of the symmetry breaking behaviour of our strongly coupled gauge theory .",
    "dp - branes are p dimensional membrane like objects to which the ends of open strings are tied . the weak coupling picture for our d3/d7 set up",
    "is shown in fig [ 73b ] @xcite - there are @xmath0 d3 branes and the lightest string states with both ends on the d3 generate the adjoint representation fields of the @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "strings stretched between the d3 and the d7 are the quark fields lying in the fundamental representation of the @xmath15 group ( they have just one end on the d3 ) .    in the strong coupling limit",
    "the d3 branes in this picture are replaced by the geometry that they induce .",
    "we will consider a gauge theory with a holographic dual described by the einstein frame geometry ads@xmath12 @xmath16 where we have split the coordinates into the @xmath17 of the gauge theory , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 which will be on the d7 brane world - volume and two directions transverse to the d7 , @xmath20 .",
    "the radial coordinate , @xmath21 , corresponds to the energy scale of the gauge theory .",

    "in addition we will allow ourselves to choose the profile of the dilaton as @xmath26 to represent the running of the gauge theory coupling , @xmath27 , where the function @xmath28 as @xmath23 .",
    "an interesting phenomenological case is to consider a gauge coupling running with a step of the form @xcite @xmath29 \\,.\\ ] ] of course in this case the geometry is not back reacted to the dilaton and the model is a phenomenological one in the spirit of ads / qcd@xcite .",
    "this form introduces conformal symmetry breaking at the scale @xmath30 which triggers chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 determines the increase in the coupling across the step .",
    "we will introduce a single d7 brane probe @xcite into the geometry to include quarks - by treating the d7 as a probe we are working in a quenched approximation although we can reintroduce some aspects of quark loops through the running coupling s form if we wish ( or know how ) .",

    "the chiral restoration transition becomes second order at high density .",
    "this latter phase resembles that of the theory with chiral symmetry breaking induced by a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in fact the b field case can be thought of as our case but with a choice of @xmath64 given by @xmath108    it is the black dotted curve ( @xmath109 ) in fig [ embed ] - it is not surprising therefore that we see similar phase structure here ( and indeed that we do provides strength to our analysis which is capturing the behaviour of top down models ) .    for very large @xmath31",
    "the step becomes very sharp and there is little change relative to our phase diagram in fig [ fig.a ] .",
    "in particular the thermal transition always remains first order .",
    "the behaviour we are seeing here can be readily explained from the d7 perspective .",
    "first of all the zero density transition with temperature is first order for a simple reason . the d7 embedding breaks chiral symmetry at zero temperature because it prefers to avoid the action cost of entering the region in which the dilaton is large . as temperature",
    "is introduced through a small horizon the interior of the space is `` eaten '' but the d7 embedding remains oblivious to this change since it never reaches down to small @xmath25 . as temperature rises",
    "the point of transition is when the horizon moves through the scale @xmath95 where the dilaton step is .",
    "once the region with a large dilaton is eaten by the black hole the preferred d7 embedding is the flat one .",
    "in fig [ eating ] we show an extreme case of this behaviour explicitly . here",
    "we have taken @xmath55 very large so that the transition in the dilaton between the low and high value is very sharp .",
    "we plot the @xmath64 profile against our radial parameter @xmath110 and mark in red the position of the black hole horizon .",
    "note that in the @xmath110 coordinates the region where @xmath64 is large depends on the temperature ( it does nt in the orignal @xmath25 coordinate ) .",
    "the dilaton effective radius @xmath111 is @xmath112 where the argument of @xmath113 in vanishes .",
    "so , as @xmath7 increases @xmath111 decreases .",

    "if @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) .",
    "the point of the first order transition is where the horizon screens the dilaton .",
    "when density is introduced the story can become more complex .",
    "the action is ( [ lagfin ] ) where it can be seen from the first of the two terms in the square root that including @xmath101 increases the action .",
    "this increase can be beneficial though if the second term with @xmath64 can be reduced .",
    "it is possible to reduce the @xmath64 term if the d7 enters the region where @xmath64 is large at small @xmath105 .",
    "this means that the situation can arise where curving off the axis and then spiking on to the axis can be the lowest action state .",
    "this is typically more likely where @xmath64 is largest in the interior space and the most savings can be made entering that region at low @xmath105 . as we have seen at large values of @xmath31 embeddings that spike onto the horizon do play a role introducing an extra phase .",
    "it is only possible to have second order transitions if all three phases we have described are present . in the d7 description",
    "the d7 must move from a curved embedding that avoids the black hole to a configuration that spikes onto the black hole to a flat embedding smoothly .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 controls the period in @xmath105 or rg scale over which the change in the coupling @xmath31 occurs .",
    "it allows us to naively go from a precociously running theory to a walking theory ( although the change in the parameter @xmath31 over that period may enter into what is meant by walking versus running too ) .    in fig [ fig.gamma ]",
    "we show the phase diagram as a function of @xmath55 at fixed @xmath95 and @xmath31 .",
    "we start at @xmath53 with a configuration already discussed that has all three phases present and second order transitions at high density . as @xmath55 is reduced so that the step function in the dilaton becomes broader the first order nature of the transitions reasserts itself . by @xmath119 the mixed phase with chiral symmetry breaking but melted mesons",
    "is no longer preferred at any temperature or chemical potential value - there is a single first order transition .    in conclusion",
    "then moving towards a walking theory by either increasing the width of the running or decreasing the magnitude of the increase in the coupling both move us towards a first order chiral transition .",
    "stronger or quicker running favours a second order transition at low temperature , high density .",
    "our goal is to attempt to reproduce a phase diagram comparable to that of qcd in our holographic model .",
    "so far we have failed to generate a second order transition with temperature at zero density which is a key part of the qcd picture .",
    "we have a further natural freedom within our holographic model to exploit though .",
    "our running dilaton is in someway supposed to represent the backreaction of the quark fields on the strongly interacting gauge dynamics to allow us to model theories with more interesting dynamics than the conformal @xmath1 gauge fields .",
    "we introduce quarks through d7 branes that break the @xmath13 symmetry of the five sphere of the original ads / cft correspondence down to @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 .",
    "our metric and ansatz for the running coupling ( [ coup ] ) though respected the full @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "it seems reasonable to make use of the broken symmetry to introduce a further free parameter into our model .",
    "the most succesful scenario we have found is to introduce our explicit @xmath123 symmetry breaking parameter , @xmath124 through the blackening factors of the metric @xmath125 with @xmath126 we show the @xmath124 dependence of our model in fig [ fig.elliptic2 ] .",
    "we start from a model with a first order transition throughout the phase plane . as we increase @xmath124 a region with melted mesons but chiral symmetry breaking develops , associated with second order transitions .",
    "it then spreads to the zero chemical potential axis    the reason for the onset of second order transitions with just temperature is simply understood .",
    "we have deformed the black hole horizon into an ellipse whose major axis is along the @xmath103 axis .",
    "the area of enlarged dilaton remains circular in the @xmath105-@xmath103 plane .",
    "thus there are temperature periods in which the area of the @xmath105-@xmath103 plane with a large dilaton is covered except for a small piece that emerges from the horizon near the @xmath105 axis .",
    "if the value of the dilaton is sufficiently large in that uncovered area to encourage the d7 to avoid it , but the horizon on the @xmath103 axis has met the zero temperature d7 embedding , then a second order transition to a black hole embedding is likely . since in the absence of the rise in the dilaton the flat embedding would now be preferred the d7 settles on the horizon so it just misses the raised dilaton area . as the black hole grows further the embedding is likely to track down onto the axis smoothly as the raised dilaton area is finally eaten .",
    "this intuition is indeed matched by the solutions as shown in fig [ fig.elliptic2 ] .",
    "the bottom phase diagram in fig [ fig.elliptic2 ] achieves our goal of reproducing a chiral transition that is second order with temperature but first order with density .",
    "in this paper we have converted the d3 probe - d7 system , that holographically describes @xmath1 super yang - mills theory with quenched @xmath46 quark multiplets , to a phenomenological description of strongly coupled quark matter .",
    "we introduced a simple unback - reacted profile for the dilaton that describes a step of variable height and width in the running coupling of the gauge theory - ( [ coup ] ) .",
    "this breaks the conformal symmetry of the model and introduces chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we have then studied the temperature and chemical potential phase structure of the model .",
    "the phase diagrams consist of three phases - a chirally symmetric phase at large temperature and density ; a chirally broken phase with non - zero quark density at intermediate values of t and @xmath97 ; and a chiral symmetry broken phase with zero quark density at low t and @xmath97 .",
    "fig [ tvsmu ] shows these phase and their holographic analogue in a previously studied case where chiral symmetry was broken by an applied magnetic field .",
    "here we showed that a small wide step in the gauge coupling s running gives rise to a single first order transition between the chiral symmetric and the broken phase ( see fig [ fig.a ] ) .",
    "if the step is made larger in height or thinner then the chirally broken phase with non - zero density also plays a role . here the transitions at low temperature with chemical potential can be second order .",
    "these results match known results in top down models in the presence of magnetic fields to induce the symmetry breaking .",
    "we were interested in reproducing phase diagrams with the structure believed to exist in qcd .",
    "to do this we made use of the broken @xmath13 symmetry of the gravity dual in the presence of d7 branes .",
    "were the branes backreacted the dilaton and geometry would reflect this symmetry breaking .",
    "we introduced a further phenomenological parameters @xmath124 in the black hole blackening factor .",
    "this models allowed us to control which volumes of the holographic space have a large dilaton value within , which the d7 branes prefer to avoid . using this one extra parameter we were able to generate phase diagrams like those in qcd with a chiral restoration transition that was second order with temperature but first order with density ( see fig [ fig.elliptic2 ] ) .",
    "the ease with which such a variety of phase structures could be obtained is very encouraging for the idea of phenomenologically modeling the qcd phase diagram holographically .",
    "further the phenomenological parameters we introduced are very natural in this context and it seems likely that top down models with such phase structures should be possible as a result .",
