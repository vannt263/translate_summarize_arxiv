    "surface codes , proposed by kitaev @xcite , are an extremely appealing class of codes for fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite . they have been generalized in various directions @xcite .",
    "recently , a new generalization of surface codes was proposed in @xcite . in this",
    "approach quantum codes are constructed based on the homology of hypergraphs rather than the homology of graphs , which is the case in surface codes .",
    "hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs ; the edges of a hypergraph can be incident on two or more vertices . just as the embedding of graphs on surfaces gives rise to codes which are topological in nature @xcite , embeddings of hypergraphs also give rise to topological quantum codes .",
    "these codes have been termed hypermap - homology codes in @xcite ; we also refer to them as hypermap codes .    arguably , the most popular surface code is kitaev s toric code defined on a square lattice of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "@xcite proposed a hypermap homology code defined on the @xmath2 square lattice .",
    "this is a @xmath3 $ ] code and it is more efficient than kitaev s toric code with respect to the number of physical qubits required to protect the same number of logical qubits while maintaining the same level of error correcting capability .",
    "this seemed to suggest that better quantum codes maybe obtained by using hypergraphs .",
    "but there are other surface codes with better parameters than the @xmath1 $ ] toric code .",
    "there exist surface codes whose parameters are @xmath4 $ ] , see @xcite .",
    "this begs the question if hypermap codes improve upon the parameters of best surface codes ?",
    "a related question is the exact relation between hypermap codes and surface codes .",
    "it was also not apparent which codes could be realized using hypermaps but not by embedding graphs on surfaces .",
    "in this paper we address these questions .",
    "the construction of hypermap codes requires us to make a choice as to whether we will represent certain boundary maps using the standard basis or not .",
    "we call those codes with standard basis as canonical hypermap codes and those with a nonstandard basis as noncanonical hypermap codes .",
    "we show that for every canonical hypermap code there is a surface code which is identical to the hypermap code .",
    "this implies that the @xmath5 $ ] hypermap code , although it improves upon the @xmath1 $ ] toric code , it is identical to another surface code .",
    "we also show that every noncanonical hypermap code can be transformed to a surface code ; we only need cnot gates for this transformation . in some cases",
    ", a noncanonical hypermap code can be identical to a surface code .",
    "a hypermap code that can not be realized by a surface code must be a noncanonical code .",
    "our results imply that hypermap codes that improve upon surface codes or which can not be realized as surface codes must be noncanonical hypermap codes . through our results ,",
    "many questions related to hypermap codes can be posed as questions about surface codes and we can study hypermap codes using surface codes . for instance , decoding of these codes can be studied in terms of related surface codes .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : bac ] after briefly reviewing surface codes , we give a self - contained introduction to hypermap codes . then in section  [ sec : main ] we present our main results which clarify the relation between canonical and noncanonical hypermap codes on one hand and the relation between hypermap codes and surface codes on the other .",
    "we then conclude with a brief discussion on the significance and consequences of our results .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of quantum codes and stabilizer formalism @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a graph with vertex set @xmath7 and edge set @xmath8 ; when there is no confusion we drop the dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "consider an embedding of the graph on a surface @xmath9",
    "i.e. a drawing of the graph on the surface so that no two edges cross each other . denote the faces of the embedding as @xmath10 .",
    "we restrict our attention only to those embeddings in which the faces are homeomorphic to open discs .",
    "such an embedding is also called a 2-cell embedding or a map .",
    "a ( stabilizer ) quantum code is obtained from the embedding as follows . on each edge",
    "we place a qubit .",
    "we associate to each vertex an operator called vertex operator , denoted by @xmath11 and to each face an operator , denoted @xmath12 .",
    "the face operators are also sometimes referred to as plaquette operators .",
    "these operators are defined as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ; while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the surface code is defined as the joint + 1-eigenspace stabilized by the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in other words , it is the quantum code with the stabilizer @xmath17 the stabilizer matrix of the surface code can be represented by @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 is the vertex - edge incidence matrix of @xmath6 and @xmath20 is the face - edge incidence matrix of @xmath6 .",
    "the surface code is an @xmath21 $ ] quantum code , where @xmath22 is the genus of the surface on which @xmath6 is embedded .",

    "denote the faces of @xmath27 by @xmath39 .",
    "an embedding of @xmath27 is called a hypermap .",
    "the labeling of the darts in the hypermap is performed as follows : we place a label to the left of the dart as we move along the dart from a hyperedge to an adjacent vertex in @xmath27 .",
    "alternatively , we place the label counterclockwise of the dart with respect to hyperedge on which it is incident . to distinguish between vertices and hyperedges of @xmath23 , elements in @xmath26 are shown as squares whereas elements in @xmath24 are shown as circles , see fig .",

    "the number of orbits of @xmath53 is the number of faces in the embedding of the hypergraph .",
    "a dart belongs to a face if and only if the label is in the interior of the face .",

    "topological codes are usually defined with respect to a series of boundary maps .",
    "we now proceed to define similar maps for the hypermaps with respect to the spaces just introduced .",
    "define a `` boundary '' map for each face , dart , and hyperedge as follows : @xmath60 recall that @xmath36 is the unique vertex on which the dart @xmath35 is incident and @xmath61 is set of darts incident on @xmath31 .",

    "we can see that this is the same as the stabilizer matrix of the hypermap - homology code given in eq .  .",
    "the substance of theorem  [ th : hmap - surf - equiv ] is that the procedure illustrated works in general and reduces a canonical hypermap - homology code to a surface code .",
    "the converse of theorem  [ th : hmap - surf - equiv ] , i.e. every surface code is also a ( canonical ) hypermap - homology code , is straightforward .",
    "[ co : canonical - hmap - surf - equiv ] every canonical hypermap - homology code is equivalent to a surface code and vice versa .",
    "we only sketch the proof .",
    "every graph @xmath6 can also be viewed as a hypergraph , denote it also by @xmath23 .",
    "the bipartite graph representation of this hypergraph is obtained by taking the original graph and splitting every edge in @xmath6 into two edges and adding a new vertex for each edge .",
    "then we can proceed with the construction proposed in @xcite to obtain a hypermap - homology code . at this point",
    "we have two codes : a hypermap code and a surface both derived from the same graph @xmath6 .",
    "but it is by no means obvious that they are identical .",
    "we show that they are the same code .",
    "note that every hyperedge in the hypermap has only two darts incident on it .",
    "one of these can be chosen as a special dart .",
    "now if we apply algorithm  [ proc : hyper2surf ] , and trace through the various transformations , we find that every hyperedge is transformed to a face with two edges in @xmath199 .",
    "this graph is identical to the graph obtained from @xmath6 where every edge is replaced by two edges .",
    "hence , @xmath161 obtained after the deletion of all the special edges from @xmath199 would be same as the original graph @xmath6 .",
    "thus every surface code is equivalent to a hypermap - homology code .",
    "this together with theorem  [ th : hmap - surf - equiv ] implies the corollary .    combining corollary  [ co : canonical - hmap - surf - equiv ] and theorem  [ th : hmap - code - equiv ] we obtain the following result :    [ co : hmap - surf - equiv ] any @xmath141 $ ] hypermap code is either identical to a surface code or it can be transformed to a surface code with the application of @xmath120 cnot gates .",
    "the cnot gates are required only if the hypermap code is noncanonical .",
    "the sequence in which the cnot gates are applied in the transformation in corollary  [ co : hmap - surf - equiv ] is reverse of the sequence in theorem  [ th : hmap - code - equiv ] . in other words",
    "it is the sequence of cnot gates required to transform the noncanonical hypermap code into a canonical code . while a noncanonical code may be transformed to a surface code , it is not necessary that it has the same parameters as the resulting surface code .",
    "in particular , the distance can change .",
    "therefore some noncanonical codes may be realized only from the embedding of hypergraphs and not by the embedding of graphs .",
    "our results imply that canonical hypermap - homology codes can not improve upon the parameters of surface codes .",
    "noncanonical hypermap codes may have better parameters than surface codes .",
    "an interesting problem in this context is to construct noncanonical hypermap codes that have better parameters than surface codes .",
    "in such a construction , we also want to be able to preserve the locality of the stabilizer generators . understanding the distance and decoding of the noncanonical codes merits further study .",
    "hypermap codes provide a different perspective on topological codes which might yield new insights into their properties and potentially lead to better quantum codes and alternate decoding algorithms for topological codes .",
    "hypermap - homology codes introduce in a very concrete fashion the use of standard hypermap homology into the study of quantum codes .",
    "the use of hypermap homology in the construction of quantum codes is an important development and its applications are yet to be fully explored in the context of quantum codes .",
    "other results such those in @xcite suggest that hypergraphs offer a fertile ground for construction of new quantum codes . the use of hypergraphs has been fruitful in subsystem codes as well and it would be interesting to study homology of hypermaps in that context also @xcite .",
    "homology of hypergraphs is considered with a different perspective in @xcite .",
    "it seems that the notion of homology used therein does not entirely coincide with that used in @xcite .",
    "it would be an interesting problem to relate the two .",
    "recall that qubits are placed on the edges of the graph in case of surface codes .",
    "if we try to associate a qubit with each dart we find that there are more darts than there are qubits .",
    "an additional problem is that @xmath200 has many bases in general . in such a situation",
    "each column of @xmath70 and @xmath71 correspond to linear combinations of the labels of the darts .",
