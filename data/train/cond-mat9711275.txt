    "the nonlinear response of a system of interacting atoms to a dc driving force has recently attracted a great interest ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the knowledge of the _ microscopic _ mechanisms for mobility , friction and lubrication processes are very important , in particular , for a better understanding of solid friction at _ macroscopic level _ , as well as in various fields of applied science and technology such as adhesion , contact formation , friction wear , lubrication , fracture , _",
    "etc_.    one generic example represents a layer of atoms adsorbed on a crystalline surface .",
    "the adsorbate in this case is considered as an atomic sub - system and the remainder is modeled as an external potential , a damping constant and a thermal bath .",
    "such a system can be treated within the framework of a generalized frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite . when an external dc force is applied to such a system",
    ", its response can be very nonlinear and complex . by contrast , the driven motion of a single brownian particle in the external periodic potential has been studied in detail and is now well understood @xcite . if the force @xmath0 is applied to the particle , the total external potential in the direction @xmath1 of the force is a corrugated plane , with a slope @xmath0 . for small forces",
    "the potential has local minima , and the particle is _",
    "locked_. the local minima disappear at forces higher then @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the periodic potential , @xmath4 its period , and @xmath5 a numerical factor depending on the shape of the potential .",
    "thus , when the applied force is adiabatically increased , the atom passes from the locked to the _ running _ state at @xmath6 , and the mobility @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the drift velocity ) reaches its maximal value @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic mass and @xmath11 the friction coefficient .",
    "on the other hand , if one decreases the force @xmath0 adiabatically starting from the running state , the critical force @xmath12 for the backward transition to the locked state is different owing to inertia of the system .",
    "namely , in the underdamped limit ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the frequency of atomic vibration in the external potential ) , the inequality @xmath15 holds , and one can observe _ hysteresis _ : in the _ bistable _ region @xmath16 , the particle is either locked or running depending on its initial velocity .",
    "for a single particle , the bistability disappears at any nonzero temperature . besides , since the `` forward '' critical force @xmath6 is independent on the friction , and the `` backward '' force @xmath17 grows linearly with friction , the width of hysteresis vanishes at @xmath18 .",
    "the problem of _ interacting _ particles in a periodic potential is much more difficult . for the overdamped case ( @xmath19 ) the nonlinear mobility of the fk model has been studied in a number of papers @xcite . by contrast , investigations of the underdamped case are very limited . in that context ,",
    "persson  @xcite observed _ hysteretic _ dynamical phase transition , similar to the @xmath20 one - particle case , in the md simulation of a 2d system of interacting atoms subjected to a periodic potential .",
    "besides , our recent work @xcite on the underdamped generalized fk model revealed strong collective effects in the dynamics of the dc - force driven layer of atoms .",
    "when the external force increases , the fk system exhibits a complex hierarchy of first - order dynamical phase transitions from the completely immobile state to the totally running state , passing through several `` slip - stick '' intermediate stages characterized by the running state of collective _ quasiparticle _ excitations of the fk model known as kinks @xcite .",
    "the scenario of these intermediate transitions depends on whether the concentration of atoms corresponds to trivial or complex atomic structure .",
    "all the observed transitions are hysteretic and , it is remarkable , that , by contrast with the case of noninteracting atoms , the hysteresis survives at _ nonzero _ temperature of the system .",
    "however , the results @xcite have been obtained for one value of the friction constant @xmath21 only .",
    "that is why , in the present work we are interested in the question how the observed dynamical transitions evolve when the friction changed .",
    "we calculate dynamical `` phase diagrams '' of the fk system in the @xmath22 plane for two generic atomic concentrations ( sect .  [ rectangular ] ) . we show that several critical forces , separating intermediate stages during the transition from the locked state to the running state of the atoms are friction dependent , and we propose a simple phenomenological approach ( sect .",
    "[ pheno ] ) which allows to explain these dependences .",
    "the detailed description of the generalized fk model under study , of the numerical procedure , and also the substantiation of the choice of model parameters can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we only outline the main aspects of the model .",
    "the atomic motion is governed by the langevin equation , @xmath23=f^{(x ) } + \\delta\\!f_{i}^{(x ) } ( t),\\ ] ] for the @xmath1 coordinate of @xmath24-th atom , and similar equations for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here",

    "the mass of atoms is chosen as unity : @xmath32 . in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "the units of other dimensional physical quantities are omitted , but they are expressed in terms of the above units .",
    "we use exponential interactions between atoms corresponding to the repulsion between atomic cores , @xmath33 where @xmath34 ev is the amplitude and inverse of @xmath35 @xmath36 determines the range of interaction .    to model the substrate , we used in the simulation the true 3d external potential , periodic in the @xmath37 plane ( with the rectangular symmetry ) and parabolic in the @xmath26 direction",

    "the choice of the lattice constants , @xmath43   and @xmath44    , and of the energy barriers , @xmath45  ev and @xmath46  ev , provide a high anisotropy of this potential , which can be viewed as the set of `` channels '' with the corrugated bottoms , oriented along the @xmath1 direction .",
    "this potential is typical for the furrowed crystal surfaces , namely our parameters were chosen for the na - w(112 ) adsystem @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath47 of a single - atom vibration along the @xmath1 direction is connected to the shape parameter @xmath48 by the relationship @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",

    "note , that our choice of parameters does not claim to be a quantitative interpretation of the concrete adsystem , because the model is oversimplified .",
    "however , we do believe on a qualitative description of the effect under investigation and claim that typical adsystems should exhibit similar behaviors .    in the present work we study the behavior of the system in a wide range of frictions in the underdamped limit @xmath56 , corresponding to typical adsystems @xcite . in the simulation",
    ", we first look for the minimum - energy configuration of the system .",
    "then , we adiabatically increase temperature and force and measure the mobility @xmath57 for given values @xmath58 and @xmath0 ( this procedure was described in detail in @xcite ) . in order to emphasize the phase transitions ,",
    "the system is studied at a very low substrate temperature , @xmath59  ev .",
    "an important parameter of the generalized fk model is the atomic concentration . for the repulsive interatomic interaction used in the present work",
    ", we have to impose the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1 and @xmath25 directions in order to fix the concentration .",
    "namely , we place @xmath60 atoms into the fixed area @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so that the dimensionless atomic concentration ( the so - called coverage in surface physics ) is equal to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . the atomic concentration in the fk system plays a crucial role since it defines the number of quasiparticle excitations , i.e. the number of geometrical ( residual ) kinks .",
    "these excitations can be defined for any background _ commensurate _ atomic structure @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are relative prime integers @xcite .",
    "if the concentration @xmath69 slightly deviates from the background value @xmath70 , the ground state of the system corresponds to large domains with background commensurate coverage @xmath70 , separated by localized incommensurate zones of compression ( expansion ) called kinks ( antikinks ) . when the background commensurate coverage is _ trivial _",
    ", @xmath71 , the kinks defined on this structure are called _ trivial _ kinks @xcite . besides , a nontrivial background coverage @xmath66 ( @xmath72 , with complex elementary cells consisting of @xmath67 atoms ) can be represented as a lattice of trivial kinks , defined on the background of the closest trivial structure .",
    "therefore , in the latter case a deviation from the @xmath66 structure can be represented as a discommensuration in the lattice of trivial kinks , i.e.  a `` kink in the kink lattice '' , called _ superkink _",
    "@xcite .",
    "as in the simulation we study finite systems , we have to chose an appropriate system size to insert @xmath73 kinks into the @xmath74 commensurate background structure ; the integers @xmath60 and @xmath75 must satisfy the equation @xcite @xmath76 where the topological charge @xmath77 is @xmath78 for the kink and @xmath79 for the antikink . as background structures ,",
    "we discuss here two interesting cases , the trivial coverage @xmath80 , and the complex coverage @xmath81 .",
    "to simplify the problem , in the present work we only consider the quasi - one - dimensional case , putting @xmath82 , so that all chains move in the same way ( however , the interaction between the atoms , as well as the atomic motion still has the 3d character ) .",
    "let us note here , that this simplified choice leads only to a minor difference in system behavior in comparison with true 2d fk system with @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "namely , the exact critical force depends slightly on the external conditions , which means that the transitions do not occur simultaneously in all the chains .",
    "a careful examination of the behavior in different chains shows an enhanced transition to sliding state due to cooperative effects in the second dimension with an exponential law @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the transition of a chain to the locked state is almost independent of neighboring chains .",
    "first , let us consider the ground state which corresponds to domains of the trivial @xmath80 coverage separated by trivial kinks : @xmath84 .",
    "namely , we took @xmath85 and @xmath86 , having thus ten kinks over the length under investigation with an average spacing of @xmath87 between kinks .    the generic @xmath88 dependence for the friction constant @xmath89 is presented in fig .",
    "[ rbf](a ) . in this figure , as well as in all figures below",
    ", it will be convenient to express force @xmath0 in the units of the constant `` forward '' critical force for a single particle @xmath90 ( @xmath91 for the shape of the external potential used in the present simulation ) . during the force - increasing process",
    ", one can distinguish several steps in the @xmath88 dependence , which correspond to a hierarchy of depinnings of kinks @xcite .",
    "namely , at @xmath92 the system is in the completely immobile state , while at @xmath93 the system has nonzero mobility @xmath94 due to the _ running state _ of trivial kinks ( fig .",
    "[ jam ]  a ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that the force @xmath95 is related to the degradation of the periodic peierls - nabarro potential @xmath96 for the trivial kinks : the kinks start to slide at @xmath97 .",
    "the second abrupt increase of the mobility to the value @xmath98 takes place when the force exceeds a certain threshold @xmath99 , connected with the vanishing of the energy barrier for creation of additional kink - antikink pairs in the system , so the number of mass carriers in the system increases , leading to the increase of the mobility .",
    "the remarkable tendency for the running kinks is to come closer to each other , thus bunching into compact groups . this tendency is especially enhanced after the second threshold @xmath100 , where the concentration of kinks is large .",
    "the bunched kinks build up dense groups of immobile atoms with @xmath101 , while the rest of the system consists of running atoms ( corresponding to the running state of force - excited antikinks ) .",
    "this state , which is very reminiscent of a _ traffic jam _",
    "[ jam](b ) ) , survives till the last threshold force @xmath102 , after which all the atoms are sliding over the periodic potential , and the system reaches the highest possible value of the mobility @xmath103 .    during the force - decreasing process",
    ", the system jumps back to the immobile state at the critical force @xmath104 , and one can see a large hysteresis which , contrary to the one - particle case , survives at nonzero temperature @xcite .    as was mentioned in the introduction , for a single brownian particle",
    "the `` forward '' force @xmath6 is independent on the friction , while the `` backward '' force @xmath17 is linearly proportional to the friction .",
    "by contrast , the situation is more complex in the case of interacting atoms .",
    "[ rec12 ] represents the dynamical phase diagram in the @xmath105 plane , where we plot the critical forces @xmath95 , @xmath100 , @xmath106 , and @xmath104 versus the friction coefficient @xmath11 .",
    "let us consider first the forward transition from the locked to the running state .",
    "one can distinguish two regions of friction corresponding to different scenarios of the transition .    *",
    "( i ) * at very low frictions , @xmath107 , there is no intermediate stages . when the force increases , the system jumps from the locked to the running state directly at the force @xmath106 , this force being exactly equal to the critical force @xmath95 for the _ kink _ transition to the running state .",
    "* ( ii ) * by contrast , at larger frictions , @xmath108 , all the above - mentioned intermediate stages with running kinks do exist .",
    "the second difference from the very low friction region is that the `` forward '' force @xmath106 and the kink - antikink nucleation force @xmath100 are _ friction - dependent _ , namely they grow with friction increasing , while the critical `` kink '' force @xmath95 remains constant . at not too high frictions , the critical force @xmath106 first increases approximately linearly with the friction @xmath11 , while at higher frictions the increase of @xmath106 slows down , and finally tends to a constant value @xmath109 , close to the value @xmath6 for noninteracting atoms ( fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , we failed to plot the critical force @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] at @xmath110 , because the `` traffic jam '' regime is not well defined anymore at these higher frictions , probably because of the small number of atoms in the immobile group ( fig .",
    "[ jam](b ) ) at @xmath84 for the finite - size system .",
    "however , at a higher concentration @xmath111 ( see next subsection [ rec - twothird ] ) , where the immobile groups are larger , the `` traffic jam '' regime is well defined at all studied frictions .",
    "the backward transition from the running to the locked state has one interesting feature .",
    "namely , the `` backward '' critical force @xmath104 grows with @xmath11 increasing ( notice , that at not too high frictions , @xmath112 exactly matches the law @xmath113 for _ noninteracting _ atoms , shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] ) .",
    "if the friction is high enough , @xmath104 is larger than the critical force for kinks @xmath114const",
    ". therefore , at @xmath115 the system jumps back to the completely _ locked _ state of atoms , while at @xmath116 the backward transition has also multistep character : when the force decreases , it first occurs a drop of the mobility @xmath57 from @xmath117 to kink - mobility value @xmath94 , and only at some @xmath118 the mobility vanishes finally .",
    "now let us describe the behavior of the system at the concentration @xmath119 ( we used @xmath85 and @xmath120 ) .",
    "the ground state in this case corresponds to domains of complex @xmath81 commensurate structure , separated by _ superkinks _ with an average spacing @xmath121 between them . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath122 structure can be viewed as a dense lattice of _ trivial _ kinks defined on the background of the @xmath123 structure .",
    "this specificity clearly manifests itself in the @xmath88 dependence plotted in fig .",
    "[ rbf](b ) for the same friction constant @xmath124 as in fig .",
    "[ rbf](a ) . during the force - increasing process",
    ", one can distinguish two sharp steps of increasing of the mobility @xmath57 .",
    "the first one , at @xmath125 , corresponds to the situation where the _ superkinks _ start to slide @xcite , whereas the second step , occurring at @xmath126 for @xmath124 , corresponds to the transition of the _ trivial _ kinks to the running state , as can be seen from the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ rec23 ] . at higher forces",
    "the increase of the mobility is smoother , and the system again reaches intermediate",
    "_ traffic jam _",
    "regime with @xmath127 , where the mobility depends on the coverage as @xmath128 , @xmath103 being the maximum mobility @xcite .",
    "the dynamical phase diagram @xmath105 for the complex coverage @xmath119 is shown in the fig .",
    "[ rec23 ] , where we plot @xmath95 , @xmath106 , @xmath104 ( as in fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] ) and , additionally , @xmath129 .",
    "however , @xmath100 is not plotted because the system goes to the `` traffic jam '' regime quite smoothly , and therefore it is difficult to resolve @xmath100 .",
    "one can see first , that the critical force for superkinks @xmath129 is independent on friction , while the force @xmath95 increases with the friction @xmath11 and reaches the constant value @xmath130 at high friction , which almost exactly matches the value @xmath131 for the case of @xmath132 coverage .",
    "the noticeable difference with the case of @xmath132 coverage is in the dependence of the forward critical force @xmath133 . _",
    "first _ , as the value of @xmath129 is very low , the low - friction region with @xmath134const is very narrow ( @xmath135 ) , and was not resolved in the simulation .",
    "_ second _ , the initial linear increase of @xmath106 with @xmath11 has a larger slope than for the @xmath132 case ; at high frictions the critical force @xmath106 also tends to a constant value @xmath136 .",
    "_ third _ , there are some irregularities in the @xmath137 dependence at intermediate frictions .",
    "namely , from the plots @xmath88 at higher frictions ( similar to the case plotted in fig .  [ rbf](b ) ) we found that in the `` traffic jam '' regime the mobility does not have a constant value @xmath98 as it is for lower frictions ( the last plateau in fig .",
    "[ rbf](b ) ) , but at certain intervals of frictions @xmath88 exhibits an additional plateau with a larger value of the mobility , @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "this should result in a lower value of the critical force @xmath106 due to the larger kinetic energy of the system in this intermediate state ( see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "finally , we observed that the `` backward '' critical force @xmath104 is almost independent on coverage , and its dependence on friction is again well described by the corresponding expression for noninteracting atoms .",
    "the most interesting feature of both phase diagrams in figs .",
    "[ rec12 ] and  [ rec23 ] is that the critical forces , separating various intermediate stages during the forward transition , are _ friction dependent _ , except the first critical force , which corresponds to the completely locked _ preceding _ stage . from this",
    ", we may conclude that the kinetic energy of the system in the _ preceding _ stage defines the transition to the _ following _ stage .",
    "below we present a discussion which allows to rationalize the contribution of the kinetic energy of the running kinks to the dynamical phase transition towards the running state of atoms .",
    "first let us consider the lowest interval of frictions , @xmath115 in the phase diagrams of figs .",
    "[ rec12 ] and  [ rec23 ] .",
    "the explanation of the dependence of @xmath106 on friction @xmath11 in this region can be done solely with the help of kinetic arguments in the following way .",
    "assume that there is a `` critical '' velocity of kink @xmath140 , above which the _ running _ kink can not exist as a stable quasiparticle ( as was found by peyrard and kruskal @xcite , such a critical velocity does exist for the running kinks in the frictionless case ) .",
    "then , if at given values of the force @xmath0 and the friction @xmath21 the kink drift velocity @xmath141 is higher than @xmath140 , the kink should destroy itself as soon as it starts to move , this immediately will cause an avalanche driving the whole system to the totally running state of atoms .    if one makes simplifying assumption that @xmath142 , the drift velocity of kinks is @xmath143 and , therefore , the region in the phase diagram @xmath22 , where the running kinks are stable , is bounded by the straight line @xmath144 .",
    "this simple linear dependence describes quite well the dependence @xmath133 for @xmath145 ( see dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ rec12 ] ,  [ rec23 ] ) .",
    "thus , for instance , in the @xmath146 case ( fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] ) for @xmath147 , when the applied force exceeds the threshold @xmath95 , the stationary drift velocity for the kink is higher than @xmath140 , and the system goes directly to the running state of atoms .",
    "this mechanism provides , that @xmath148 const in this region .",
    "however , at higher frictions , @xmath149 , the kink can move as a stable quasiparticle , and the transition to the running state takes place at a higher force @xmath150 ( fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] ) .",
    "such a linear dependence holds also ( and even better ) for the coverage @xmath119 at not too high friction ( see fig .",
    "[ rec23 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , we failed to find the value of the critical velocity explicitly , because we do not know the values for the kink mass @xmath151 and the friction coefficient @xmath152 .",
    "however , we observed that this critical velocity @xmath140 is proportional to the sound velocity @xmath153 ( defined as @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the average interatomic distance along the chain ) . indeed , from the slopes of dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ rec12 ] ,  [ rec23 ] the ratio of the critical velocities for both studied coverages is @xmath156 , and the corresponding ratio of the sound velocities for the background coverages is @xmath157 = 0.74 .    at higher frictions , @xmath158 , @xmath106 starts to deviate significantly from the simple linear law , and finally tends to a constant value @xmath159 .",
    "this behavior may be qualitatively explained if we take into account that the _ running _ kinks stimulate the transition of the system to the totally running state .",
    "indeed , owing to their nonzero kinetic energy @xmath160 , the running kinks effectively reduce the average energy barrier for the transition of all the atoms to the running state ; therefore the effective barrier @xmath161 should be lower than @xmath162 .",
    "let us approximate the effective barrier as @xmath163 , where @xmath164 .",
    "then , the critical force for the transition to the running state , @xmath165 , is determined by the following equation , @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a phenomenological coefficient , and @xmath168 .",
    "( [ forward ] ) provides a qualitative agreement with the simulation data : at small @xmath21 the forward force is proportional to @xmath21 , @xmath169 , while at @xmath170 we have @xmath171 .",
    "unfortunately , the quantitative agreement is not satisfactory . even if eq.([forward ] ) can provide a rather good fitting of the @xmath172 dependence in fig .",
    "[ rec12 ] , the nonmonotonic peculiarities of @xmath173 in fig .",
    "[ rec23 ] remains unexplained .",
    "we recall , however , that the main simplification made above , is that the friction coefficient for the running kinks @xmath174 is equal to @xmath21 .",
    "but the running kink experiences also the _ intrinsic _ friction @xmath175 , so that the correct expression is @xmath176 , where @xmath175 depends very nonlinearly and _ resonantly _ on the kink velocity @xmath177 @xcite . the intrinsic part of friction arises because the propagating kink excites small - amplitude waves ( phonons ) in the discrete atomic chain . at certain drift velocities",
    "the translational motion of kink ( i.e. the frequency with which kinks `` hits '' the particles ) can come in a resonance with the allowed phonon frequencies , which results in bigger losses of energy by kink and increases effective damping .",
    "this is very likely why one can observe nonmonotonic variation of @xmath172 in fig .",
    "[ rec23 ] .",
    "the proposed qualitative picture may be applied not only to @xmath106 , but also to other intermediate critical forces , such as @xmath100 or @xmath95 in the case of the complex background @xmath178 coverage .",
    "for example , the critical force for the trivial kinks @xmath95 increases with the friction in the @xmath178 case , when the preceding stage is characterized by the running superkinks ( fig .",
    "[ rec23 ] ) ; @xmath95 tends to the constant value found for trivial background coverage @xmath146 only at high frictions , when the kinetic energy contribution of superkinks to the initialization of the trivial kinks motion becomes unessential .",
    "finally , let us comment the fact , that the asymptotic ( @xmath179 ) forward critical force @xmath159 , for both studied coverages , has been found equal to the critical force for a single atom @xmath180 .",
    "this is easy to understand if one takes into account that the studied atomic chain corresponds to a low - coupling limit @xcite , because the dimensionless elastic constant @xmath181 is well below unity for both studied coverages , namely @xmath182 $ ] for @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the interaction between atoms should not lead to a significant change of the barrier for the transfer of an atom to the running state _ unless the running kinks contribute to this transition . _",
    "thus , we have studied the dynamical phase transition from the locked to the running state of interacting atoms in a periodic external potential under the action of a dc external force in the underdamped limit of a generalized frenkel - kontorova model .",
    "this transition proceeds by a complex multistep scenario , which can be treated as a hierarchy of depinnings of quasiparticle excitations of the fk model ( kinks ) .",
    "the interesting feature of the transition is that the critical forces separating different intermediate stages during the `` forward '' transition , are friction dependent , except the first critical force , which corresponds to the transition from the completely locked ground state .",
    "this reflects the dynamical nature of transitions between intermediate stages , namely that the kinetic energy of running kinks in the _ preceding _ stage significantly contributes to the transition towards the _ following _ stage .",
    "on the basis of simulation results , we have proposed a phenomenological approach which qualitatively explains the observed friction dependences of the critical forces . according to this approach , for low frictions the critical quantity determining",
    "the criterion for the transition to the totally running state of atoms , is the drift velocity of kinks at the preceding stage .",
    "this approach leads to the simple phenomenological equation ( [ forward ] ) for the dependence of the forward critical force on friction .",
    "however , for better quantitative description of the simulation results one has to take into account the resonant interaction of the running kinks with the phonons excited in the atomic chain @xcite .",
