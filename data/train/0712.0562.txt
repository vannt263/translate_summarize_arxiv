    "dark matter particles with dominant interaction on electrons have been considered in literature @xcite . in particular , from a phenomenological point of view , dark matter ( dm ) candidates with electron interactions can offer possible sources for the 511 kev positron annihilation line observed from the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "these candidates can be either light ( mev scale ) @xcite or heavy ( gev or larger scale ) @xcite .",
    "they are expected to interact with electrons both through neutral light ( mev scale ) u or z bosons or through heavy charged mediators @xmath1 ( which can eventually be nearly degenerate with @xmath0 ) @xcite .",

    "other results showing some resonances at energies lower than the two - muon @xcite and the two - pion @xcite disintegration thresholds have been associated with a goldstone neutral boson of @xmath4 mev mass . moreover ,",
    "some excess has been achieved in dedicated experiments on low energy nuclear reactions searching for possible @xmath5 pairs driven by the presence of a neutral boson with a mass around 10 mev @xcite .",
    "let us remark that  in the frameworks where the mediator is either a @xmath6 charged boson or a neutral boson providing a flavour changing transition among quarks  the elastic scatterings of the dm candidate @xmath7 particles on nuclei would be either forbidden or suppressed ; hence , the scattering on electrons would remain the unique possibility for the direct detection of the @xmath7 particles .",
    "on the other hand , from a pure theoretical point of view , it is also conceivable that the mediator of the dm particle interactions can be coupled only to the lepton sector of the ordinary matter .",
    "thus , in this case the dm particles can just interact with electrons and can not with nuclei .",
    "this is suggested in ref .",

    "are assumed to have three `` leptonic ( @xmath10 ) colours '' and to interact through the gauge group @xmath11 , analogously as the qcd colour group @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , at some high energy scale a symmetry breaking @xmath13 is expected , giving high mass to the `` exotic '' leptonic degree of freedom and leaving light the `` standard '' leptons @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "the heavy `` exotic '' leptonic degree of freedom provides both heavy charged @xmath14 fermions , which are expected to be confined into exotic _",
    "leptonic hadrons _ by the unbroken gauge group @xmath15 @xcite , and heavy neutrinos @xcite ; hence , they can be considered as dark matter candidates with dominant interaction on electrons .    moreover , it is worth to note that other possibilities can exist .",
    "for example , supersymmetric ( susy ) theories can offer configurations in the general susy parameter space where the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) has an interaction with electron dominant with respect to that with quark .",
    "these dm candidate particles can be directly detected only through their interaction with electrons in the detectors of a suitable experiment , while they are lost by experiments based on the rejection of the electromagnetic component of the experimental counting rate .    in the present paper this kind of dm candidates",

    "the practical possibility to detect electron interacting dm candidates ( hereafter @xmath0 with mass @xmath17 and 4-momentum @xmath18 ) is based on the detectability of the energy released in @xmath0 - electron elastic scattering processes ( see fig . [",

    "however , the electron is bound in the atom and , even if the atom is at rest , the electron can have not negligible momentum , @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the bound electrons in nai(tl ) offer a probability equal to @xmath22 to have @xmath23 0.5 mev / c ; such a probability is quite small , but not zero .",
    "hence , interactions of @xmath7 particles with these high - momentum electrons in an atom at rest can give rise to detectable signals in suitable detectors .",
    "in particular , after the interaction the final state can have  beyond the scattered @xmath7 particle  either a prompt electron and an ionized atom or an excited atom plus possible x - rays / auger electrons .",
    "therefore , the process produces x - rays and electrons of relatively low energy , which are mostly contained with efficiency @xmath24 in a detector of a suitable size .",

    "<S> some extensions of the standard model provide dark matter candidate particles which can have a dominant coupling with the lepton sector of the ordinary matter . </S>",
    "<S> thus , such dark matter candidate particles ( @xmath0 ) can be directly detected only through their interaction with electrons in the detectors of a suitable experiment , while they are lost by experiments based on the rejection of the electromagnetic component of the experimental counting rate . </S>",
    "<S> these candidates can also offer a possible source of the 511 kev photons observed from the galactic bulge . in this paper </S>",
