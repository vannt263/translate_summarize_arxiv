    "young supernova remnants ( snrs ) are widely believed to be the main source of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "@xcite discovered synchrotron x - rays from shells of sn  1006 , which was the first observational clue of cosmic - ray electrons being accelerated up to the tev energy range .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another piece of evidence for cosmic - ray acceleration in snrs was obtained from gamma - ray observations .",
    "very - high - energy ( vhe ) and gev gamma - rays have been detected from several snrs , although , it is still unclear whether their origin is hadronic or leptonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite these various pieces of evidence in favor of acceleration , it is still unclear how the acceleration process evolves in snrs , in particular how the accelerated particles cool down and how they escape from snrs .",
    "one reason for this lack of understanding is that past observational studies have concentrated on individual sources alone . in this paper ,",
    "we investigate , for the first time , the time evolution of snr synchrotron x - rays , using all available data in literature for sources in which this emission component is bright . in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we describe the evolution of synchrotron x - ray luminosity in our sample . an interpretation and a simple model to support it are in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : discuss ] is devoted to discussion of the results .",
    "we searched the literature for reports of synchrotron x - ray emission from snrs and found a total of 14 such sources .",
    "however , we could not use all of these for the current study , for various reasons .",
    "kepler @xcite and g330.2 + 1.0 @xcite had to be removed from our sample , because of the difficulty of estimating the total synchrotron x - ray luminosity , caused by a low detection significance or by contamination from thermal x - rays .",
    "thus our sample consists of the 12 snrs listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we used the latest value of the 210  kev synchrotron x - ray unabsorbed flux from the references listed in the table .",
    "when the reported flux was not absorption - corrected or was for a different energy band , we normalized it unabsorbed flux in the 210  kev using the best - fit model in the references",
    ". synchrotron x - ray emission may have a spectral roll - off in the 210  kev band .",
    "when significant roll - off was reported in the references , we took such a component into account while computing the flux . some snrs",
    "( cas  a , tycho , sn  1006 ) have bright thermal x - ray emission , which makes it difficult to estimate the synchrotron x - ray flux . in these cases , we inferred the synchrotron x - ray flux based on wide - band information and/or detailed spectroscopy to isolate synchrotron x - rays from thermal component , as we believe such analysis can provide the most reliable results currently available .",
    "two of the sample sources , w28 and g156.7 + 5.7 , are largely extended but were only partly observed with enough exposure in x - rays . as the x - ray luminosities can be deduced only for the observed regions ( 5% for w28 and 26% for g156.7 + 5.7 , respectively ) , possible contributions from the unobserved regions",
    "are included in the upper error bars .",
    "when we estimated these contributions , we assumed that the surface brightness of the unobserved region in each source is identical to that of the observed one .",
    "the distance uncertainty is also included into the errors on the luminosity .",
    "we used a 10% distance uncertainty for cases where no uncertainty was available in the literature . in summary",
    ", we took into account the following uncertainties ; statistical errors given in literatures , systematic distance uncertainty , and the limited coverage of the snr extension .    in order to study the time evolution",
    ", we need to know the snr ages .",
    "however , we have only four snrs whose ages are historically known .",
    "another parameter , the ionization time scale of heated plasma , is also difficult to determine since several snrs show no thermal emission .",
    "we thus use the physical radius of each snr , @xmath2 , as the age indicator .",
    "@xmath2 is taken from @xcite . the distance uncertainty is included in the error computation .",
    "some snrs have distorted shapes , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : sample ] .",
    "this is also included in the errors on the radii .",
    "all the derived parameters are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : sample ] .",
    "the radius of a snr depends on the density of the interstellar medium , but rather insensitively . for remnants in the sedov phase , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the upstream number density ) .",
    "the radius changes by only a factor of @xmath02 even if the upstream density changes by 2  orders of magnitude .",
    "the radius also has very weak dependency on the explosion energy @xmath5 , @xmath6 . on the other hand , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the age of the remnant ) .",
    "thus the radius is a good age indicator .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_lx ] shows the synchrotron x - ray luminosity as a function of the radius .",
    "one can see that the luminosity is in the order of @xmath9@xmath10  ergs  s@xmath11 when the snrs are smaller than @xmath125  pc , which corresponds to an age of a few hundred years , whereas it decreses to @xmath13@xmath14  ergs  s@xmath11 beyond @xmath125  pc .",
    "it appears that the luminosity drops off rapidly at @xmath125  pc , although the scatter is rather large .",
    "note that all the snrs with @xmath15  pc display synchrotron x - rays brighter than @xmath9  ergs  s@xmath11 @xcite , whereas most of larger snrs do not have significant synchrotron x - rays .",
    "this fact makes the difference of luminosities larger between the two regions .",
    "the drop off in non - thermal x - ray luminosity reaches two or three orders of magnitude , which is much larger than the errors on the individual luminosities .",
    "we have carried out a similar analysis for the thermal x - ray luminosity for snrs in the large magellanic cloud @xcite and the radio luminosity of galactic snrs @xcite . however ,",
    "no drop off like that observed for synchrotron x - rays has been found .",
    "here we consider the cause of the decrease in synchrotron x - ray emission identified in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath16-spectrum of synchrotron x - ray radiation has a peak around the roll - off frequency , @xmath17 , above which the flux rapidly decays towards higher frequencies .",
    "as snrs evolve , @xmath17 is known to decrease ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed rapid decay in synchrotron x - rays around @xmath18 could be caused by @xmath17 passing through the x - ray band to lower energies . in this section",
    ", we discuss this possibility in detail .",
    "we introduce essential argument first , and show a simple model to support it later .",
    "we assume that the electron acceleration is energy - loss - limited , in which the maximum energy of electrons , @xmath19 , is determined from the balance of the synchrotron loss and acceleration : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gyro - factor . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : emax_e ] ) , we equate the acceleration time , @xmath22 with the synchrotron cooling time , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the shock velocity and the downstream magnetic field , respectively . in this case",

    "* ) . for these snrs ,",
    "eq.([eq : rolloff ] ) is consistent with the observational values to within 1 order of magnitude assuming @xmath27 .",
    "also note that the effect of particle escape from the shock region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) is not considered in this paper .",
    "this effect might be important for older snrs @xcite .",
    "however , our present model reproduces the observed trend well , suggesting that particle escape is not yet significant for these snrs ( see also the last paragraph in section  4 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of synchrotron radiation is well approximated analytically .",
    "it is mainly determined by shock dynamics in the snr if the synchrotron x - ray - emitting electrons with energy @xmath28 satisfy @xmath29 , where @xmath8 is the age of the snr . in this case , the energy spectrum of electrons is generally given by @xmath30\\ \\",

    "we also note that the shape of the cutoff is analytically obtained in @xcite . given the electron distribution , we calculate the approximate formula of the x - ray luminosity , @xmath34 .",
    "the characteristic frequency , @xmath35 , of the synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons with energy @xmath28 is given by @xmath36 then , as long as @xmath37 , we can apply the standard formula , @xmath38 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath39 , the spectral slope steepens ( @xmath40 ) due to the steepening of the electron distribution , and we derive @xmath41 where we assume that @xmath34 is continuous at @xmath42 , and we again use the result of @xcite for the cutoff shape . calculating @xmath43 as @xmath44 we find that throughout the evolution of the snr , the x - ray band ( 210  kev ) always lies above @xmath43 because for young snrs ( @xmath45  yr ) , the magnetic field may be amplified to @xmath46 g ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( [ eq : luminoosity ] ) is thus a good approximation of the x - ray luminosity for any arbitrary epoch . in particular , when @xmath47 , the x - ray luminosity is insensitive to the magnetic field , depending instead mainly on @xmath17 . as the snr ages , the shock velocity @xmath24 decreases and @xmath17 becomes smaller .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rolloff ] ) tells us that @xmath17 is below the x - ray band ( 210  kev ) when @xmath48 cm  s@xmath11 , so that the x - ray luminosity drops off .    in order to demonstrate the above argument",
    ", we construct a simple model to calculate the synchrotron x - ray flux . in our model , a simple shock dynamics scenario is considered .",
    "we assume that the forward shock velocity of snrs @xmath24 is a function of the age of snr @xmath49 as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52  erg , and @xmath4 are the initial velocity , initial energy of ejecta , and the upstream number density , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model assumes that the snr forward shock propagates into a homogeneous medium .",
    "this is , however , not always in the case , since the snrs could be located inside of superbubbles made by pre - explosion stellar winds .",
    "more detailed models for core - collapsed type snrs , such as rcw  86 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should be applied .",
    "but it is left for future work .",
    "as illustrated above , the x - ray luminosity has little dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , we model the evolution of the downstream magnetic field , @xmath25 , as follows .",
    "usually , the amplified magnetic field @xmath53 is simply assumed to scale with @xmath24 @xcite , because magnetic field evolution remains ill - understood .",
    "here we adopt an assumption similar to @xcite , leading to a dependence of @xmath54 .",
    "let the energy density of the amplified magnetic field @xmath55 be proportional to the thermal energy density @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the energy - partition parameter , a compression ratio , and a downstream temperature obtained by the rankine - hugoniot equation @xmath61m_pv_s{}^2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath62^{1/2 } v_s$ ] .",
    "the downstream magnetic field is thus given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 g is the field strength in the interstellar matter .",
    "for given @xmath8 , we calculate @xmath24 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) , the shock radius @xmath2 by the integration of @xmath24 , and the luminosity of synchrotron x - rays numerically by using the value of @xmath25 and the electron distribution given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emax_e ] ) and ( [ eq : n_e ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 as fiducial parameters .",
    "note that for @xmath70 , the evolution of the amplified magnetic field in young snrs is approximately reproduced @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with previous observational implications for snrs @xcite .",
    "one finds that with the above assumption for the magnetic field , the cooling time of synchrotron x - ray - emitting electrons is always smaller than the snr age , @xmath8 , so that the x - ray luminosity is well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminoosity ] ) . also note that the value of @xmath21 is near unity , implying that acceleration is near the bohm limit .",
    "we assume that the normalization factor of the electron distribution @xmath71 is constant with time .",
    "this is justified if the amount of accelerated particles is proportional to the product of the fluid ram pressure and the snr volume , that is , @xmath72 . in the sedov phase ( @xmath73 ) during which @xmath17 crosses the x - ray band , we find that @xmath71 is constant with time .    fig .",
    "[ fig : r_lx ] shows the results for @xmath74 , 1.0 , and 0.1  @xmath75 .",
    "for the first two cases , we set @xmath76 , whereas @xmath77 for @xmath78  @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath71 is expressed in the cgs units .",
    "one can see that our model roughly reproduces the observed trend with reasonable model parameters . the assumed density , @xmath79 , is typical for the interstellar medium around snrs , although there are discrepancies for some individual samples .",
    "some snrs are likely to be located in bubbles or very low density regions .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that rcw  86 is in a super - bubble and expands into extremely low density materials .",
    "as a result , this snr should have a very large radius compared with its age .",
    "@xmath71 is also a free parameter which may change from source to source .",
    "adjusting @xmath71 to within 1  order of magnitude , it is possible to find a solution for the observed density in each case . since our aim is simply to reproduce the overall evolutionary trend in an approximate manner , we ignore such fluctuations in this work .",
    "we have reproduced the observed fast drop - off in synchrotron x - ray luminosity with snr radius using a quite simple model .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered a decline of a few percent in the synchrotron x - ray power from one source , cas  a , and reached a similar conclusion .",
    "the total and maximum energy of accelerated particles can be derived from our model . with the adopted values of @xmath71 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_e ] ) , we can calculate the total energy of accelerated electrons with the energy above @xmath80 to be @xmath81@xmath82  ergs , which is reasonable since this range is much smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "note that these estimated values could increase by 1 order of magnitude if we increase @xmath21 by up to 10 .",
    "even if we alter the value of @xmath84 , the results remain similar if we appropriately reset the normalization @xmath71 .",
    "this is expected from equation  ( [ eq : luminoosity ] ) .",
    "for example , the results for @xmath85 are almost perfectly in agreement with the case of @xmath66 if we choose @xmath86 @xmath74 and 1.0  @xmath75 and @xmath87 for @xmath78  @xmath75 . in these cases ,",
    "the total energy of accelerated electrons with energy above @xmath80 is again @xmath81@xmath82  ergs . @xcite",
    "estimated the energy of injected accelerated electrons in sn  1006 for the first time .",
    "this was found to be @xmath88@xmath89  ergs per small segments of filaments , although with rather large uncertainty .",
    "the total energy of accelerated electrons is approximately @xmath90@xmath82  ergs considering the size of these segments , which is consistent with our result .",
    "@xcite show that the enegy injected into accelerated electrons is always similar in young snrs , which is also consistent with our results . theoretically , @xcite estimated the energy injected into accelerated protons to be @xmath91  ergs in the case of rx  j1713@xmath923946 .",
    "this is also consistent with our results when we consider the electron and proton ratio of @xmath93 in cosmic rays .    at present , no direct information on the accelerated protons is obtained by x - ray observations .",
    "one might consider whether we could estimate the total energy of accelerated protons under the assumption of a similar @xmath71 as for electrons .",
    "however , this is not possible because the injection efficiency is different in each case . on the other hand",
    ", the maximum energy of accelerated protons , @xmath94 , can be estimated according to our model .",
    "the synchrotron and @xmath95-decay loss timescales are negligible for protons , and thus @xmath94 is determined by the condition @xmath96 , and we obtain @xmath97 although the effect of the wave damping and/or escape may be significant in older systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we ignore it here for simplicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : emax_evolution ] shows @xmath94 as a function of @xmath8 . in the free expansion phase , @xmath94 increases in proportion to the age , and protons are accelerated quickly up to around the knee energy in @xmath0100  yr .",
    "when the shock velocity decreases , @xmath94 becomes smaller .",
    "hence @xmath94 peaks at @xmath98 .",
    "in contrast to the case of electron acceleration , @xmath99 ( that is the maximum of @xmath94 ) is larger for higher upstream density @xmath4 , and it changes only within a factor of @xmath100 for @xmath4 = 0.15.0  @xmath75 . since @xmath101 and @xmath102 , one finds @xmath103 .",
    "protons are accelerated up to @xmath104  ev in any snr , with little density dependence .",
    "this result might be important for explaining the break at @xmath105  ev in the observed cosmic - ray spectrum with the shock acceleration on snrs .",
    "on the other hand , one can find @xmath106 if @xmath107 .",
    "hence the maximum energy of electrons scales as @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the free expansion and sedov phases , respectively , so that it depends only weakly on the snr age .",
    "recent _ fermi _ observations of middle - aged snrs have shown the presence of a gamma - ray spectral break around energies of a few gev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several interpretations have been given ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of which is the escape of particles from acceleration sites . in this scenario , accelerated particles with energies of more than about 10 - 100  gev have already escaped from the acceleration region @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our present model has shown that even for @xmath110  yr , @xmath111  tev electrons still exist around the shock front ( see figure  [ fig : emax_evolution ] )",
    ". this apparent discrepancy may come from the fact that most snrs observed by _",
    "fermi _ are interacting with molecular clouds , whereas in our sample there is only one ( w  28 ) undergoing such a collision .",
    "hence molecular clouds may play an important role in dispersing cosmic rays from the snr shock into the interstellar matter .",

    "<S> a systematic study of the synchrotron x - ray emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) has been conducted . </S>",
    "<S> we selected a total of 12 snrs whose synchrotron x - ray spectral parameters are available in the literature with reasonable accuracy , and studied how their luminosities change as a function of radius . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the synchrotron x - ray luminosity tends to drop especially when the snrs become larger than @xmath05  pc , despite large scatter . </S>",
    "<S> this may be explained by the change of spectral shape caused by the decrease of the synchrotron roll - off energy . </S>",
    "<S> a simple evolutionary model of the x - ray luminosity is proposed and is found to reproduce the observed data approximately , with reasonable model parameters . according to the model , the total energy of accelerated electrons is estimated to be @xmath1  ergs , which is well below the supernova explosion energy . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum energies of accelerated electrons and protons are also discussed . </S>"
