    "the normal confinement of quarks and gluons in hadrons is removed and the partons can exist as quasi - free particles in an extended region of space - time .",
    "one of the first signatures proposed for the formation of a qgp state was an enhancement of strange particle production in a+a with respect to p+p collisions @xcite .",
    "the argumentation relies on the assumption that gluon fusion processes , which may be dominant in a qgp , produce additional s@xmath5  pairs@xcite .",
    "this in turn will cause the abundance of strange quarks to reach its chemical equilibrium value in much shorter times than would be possible in a pure hadronic scenario .",
    "in fact , the enhanced production of strange particles has been observed already quite early in high energy nucleus ",

    "nucleus collisions have shown that strangeness enhancement is not only seen at high energies , such as top sps and rhic energies , but it is also observed at lower energies ( @xmath8  gev ) @xcite where no qgp formation is expected . actually , here the production of @xmath0 and @xmath6 exhibits an even stronger enhancement than present at top sps or rhic energies @xcite .",
    "generally , it is found that the abundances of strange particles in central a+a reactions are similar to those expected from statistical hadron gas models assuming a grand canonical ensemble @xcite . while the enhancement at lower energies can to a certain extent",
    "also be explained by transport models , at higher energies additional mechanisms have to be involved in order to reach chemical equilibrium values via a dynamical evolution .",
    "it has , e.g. , been suggested that multi - pion reaction processes can lead to an accelerated equilibration of anti - hyperon production in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions @xcite . especially at larger densities , as present close to the qgp phase boundary , processes like this might drive the system quite fast to a chemical equilibrium state @xcite . still it is an open question whether such dynamical explanations are applicable as well at lower energies .",
    "on the other hand , it was suggested that particle production via strong interaction always follows the maximum entropy principle and therefore hadron abundances are naturally close to the outcome of statistical processes @xcite .",
    "the measurement of hyperon production in an energy range below top sps energy ( @xmath9  gev ) provides important constraints on both , the statistical and transport model approach .",
    "recent results on kaon production in central nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions @xcite indicate a sharp maximum of the ratio @xmath10 and a sudden change in the energy dependence of the @xmath11  of pions , kaons , and protons at a beam energy of 30 , where @xmath12 is the transverse mass , @xmath13 the rest mass and @xmath14  the transverse momentum . these anomalies can be interpreted as a signal for the onset of deconfinement @xcite and might also be visible in the energy dependence of hyperon yields .",

    "while in shm(a )  @xcite a separate fit at each energy to all available particle multiplicities is performed by varying chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath46  and baryonic chemical potential @xmath47 , the input parameters @xmath46  and @xmath47  in shm(b )  @xcite are taken from a smooth parametrization of the @xmath16-dependence of the original fit results . in addition , the model shm(a ) includes a parameter to allow for strangeness undersaturation @xmath48 , which is not present in model shm(b ) ( i.e. @xmath48  =  1 ) .",
    "both models use a grand canonical ensemble for the results shown here . in the case of model",
    "shm(b ) an additional correction by a canonical suppression factor is applied .",
    "however , for central a+a collisions this correction is only effective at ags energies ( @xmath49  gev ) @xcite .",
    "thus , shm(b ) provides a baseline defining the state of maximal chemical equilibrium that is attainable .",
    "however , the parametrization that provides the basis of shm(b ) has been tuned to fit mid - rapidity ratios , while the fits with shm(a ) have been done for total multiplicities which complicates a direct comparison between the two approaches .",
    "shm(b ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndypion ] , generally overpredicts all measured mid - rapidity ratios at the higher sps energies ( @xmath50  gev ) , while at lower sps and at rhic energies a satisfactory agreement is achieved .",
    "therefore , in the data a sharper maximum in the energy dependence of the @xmath0/@xmath45 and @xmath2/@xmath45  ratios is observed than in the model .",
    "the na57 results exibit a similarly shaped energy dependence",
    ". however , the ratios are generally higher than the na49 results .",
    "the observed maxima in the @xmath0/@xmath45 and @xmath2/@xmath45 ratios occur in the same energy range as the observed distinct peak in the k@xmath51/@xmath52 ratio @xcite .",
    "since the latter can be interpreted as a signature for the onset of deconfinement , the question appears whether the maxima in the @xmath0/@xmath45 and @xmath2/@xmath45 ratios can be attributed to the same effect .",
    "in contrast to the k@xmath51 , which carry together with the k@xmath53 the bulk of the anti - strange quarks and are thus a relatively direct measure of the strangeness production , the interpretation of the strange baryons is complicated by the fact that their sensitivity to the strangeness production is strongly modified by the energy dependent baryon number distributions . at low energies , with high baryonic chemical potential ,",
    "the production of baryons is favoured and more strange quarks will end up in @xmath0  and @xmath2 , compared to higher energies where strange quarks might predominantly be contained in k@xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is underlined by the fact that the statistical model approaches , which reflect the dependence of particle yields on @xmath47 , provide a relatively good describtion of the data . whether the remaining discrepancies between shm(b ) and the mid - rapidity ratios at 80@xmath4 and 158  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dndypion ] , panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) might be attributed to the onset of deconfinement can in the light of the systematic uncertainties not be definitely answered .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the mid - rapidity @xmath0/@xmath45 and @xmath2/@xmath45 ratios are also strongly affected by the rapid change of the shape of the @xmath0  and @xmath2  rapidity distributions with energy .",
    "this effect will cause a more pronounced energy dependence of the mid - rapidity ratios in comparison to the 4@xmath45 ratios , which in principle can not be described by statistical models .    the @xmath36/@xmath40  and @xmath37/@xmath40  ratios , as measured in central nucleus ",

    "the enhancement is of the order of @xmath172 , without any significant energy dependence in the range covered by the data .",

    "in fact , the model rather predicts a @xmath1-suppression , which is mainly due to the fact that the @xmath37/@xmath40  ratio in p+p reactions is grossly overestimated ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhance],b ) .",
    "since the net - baryon density is largest around @xmath16  =  5  gev , the production of strange baryons exhibits a pronounced maximum at these energies .",

    "[ fig : multpion ] and  [ fig : dndypion ] ) .",

    "this argument applies even more strongly .",
