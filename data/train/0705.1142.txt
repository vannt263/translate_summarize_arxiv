    "a _ tiling substitution rule _ is a rule that can be used to construct infinite tilings of @xmath0 using a finite number of tile types .",
    "the rule tells us how to  substitute \" each tile type by a finite configuration of tiles in a way that can be repeated , growing ever larger pieces of tiling at each stage . in the limit",
    ", an infinite tiling of @xmath0 is obtained .    in this paper",
    "we take the perspective that there are two major classes of tiling substitution rules : those based on a linear expansion map and those relying instead upon a sort of  concatenation \" of tiles . the first class , which we call _ geometric tiling substitutions _",
    ", includes _ self - similar tilings _ ,",
    "of which there are several well - known examples including the penrose tilings . in this class a tile is substituted by a configuration of tiles that is a linear expansion of itself , and this geometric rigidity has permitted quite a bit of research to be done .",
    "we will note some of the fundamental results , directing the reader to appropriate references for more detail . the second class , which we call _ combinatorial tiling substitutions _",
    ", is sufficiently new that it lacks even an agreed - upon definition . in this class",
    "the substitution rule replaces a tile by some configuration of tiles that may not bear any geometric resemblance to the original .",
    "the difficulty with such a rule comes when one wishes to iterate it : we need to be sure that the substitution can be applied repeatedly so that all the tiles fit together without gaps or overlaps .",
    "the examples we provide are much less well - known ( in some cases new ) and are ripe for further study .",
    "the two classes are related in a subtle and interesting way that is not yet well understood .",
    "the study of aperiodic tilings in general , and substitution tilings specifically , comes from the confluence of several discoveries and lines of research .",
    "interest in the subject from a philosophical viewpoint came to the forefront when wang @xcite asked about the decidability of the  tiling problem \" : whether a given set of prototiles can form an infinite tiling of the plane .",
    "he tied this answer to the existence of  aperiodic prototile sets \" : finite sets of tiles that can tile the plane , but only nonperiodically .",
    "he saw that the problem is undecidable if an aperiodic prototile set exists .",
    "berger @xcite was the first to find an aperiodic prototile set and was followed by many others , including penrose .",
    "it turned out that one way prove a prototile set is aperiodic involves showing that every tiling formed by the prototile set is self - similar .",
    "independently , work was proceeding on one - dimensional symbolic substitution systems , a combination of dynamical systems and theoretical computer science .",
    "symbolic dynamical systems had become of interest due to their utility in coding more complex dynamical systems , and great progress was being made in our understanding of these systems .",
    "queffelec @xcite summarized what was known about the ergodic and spectral theory of substitution systems , while a more recent survey of the state of the art appears in @xcite .",
    "substitution tilings can be seen as a natural extension of this branch of dynamical systems ; insight and proof techniques can often be borrowed for use in the tiling situation .",
    "we will use symbolic substitutions motivate our study in the next section .    from the world of physics ,",
    "a major breakthrough was made in 1984 by schechtman et .",
    "@xcite with the discovery of a metal alloy that , by rights , should have crystalline since its x - ray spectrum was diffractive . however , the diffraction pattern had five - fold rotational symmetry , which is not allowed for ideal crystals !",
    "this type of matter has been termed  quasicrystalline \" , and self - similar tilings like the penrose tiling , having the right combination of aperiodicity and long - range order , were immediately recognized as valid mathematical models .",
    "dynamical systems entered the picture , and it was realized that the spectrum of a tiling dynamical system is closely related to the diffraction spectrum of the solid it models @xcite .",
    "thus we find several points of departure for the study of substitution tilings and their dynamical systems .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite set called an _ alphabet _ , whose elements are called _",
    "letters_. then @xmath2 , the set of all finite _ words _ with elements from @xmath1 , forms a semigroup under concatenation .",
    "a _ symbolic substitution _ is any map @xmath3 .",
    "a symbolic substitution can be applied to words in @xmath2 by concatenating the substitutions of the individual letters .",
    "a block of the form @xmath4 will be called a _ level-@xmath5 block of type @xmath6_.    [ const1d ] let @xmath7 and let @xmath8 and @xmath9 . beginning with the letter",
    "@xmath6 we get @xmath10 where we ve added spaces to emphasize the breaks between substituted blocks .",
    "notice that the block lengths triple when substituted .",
    "[ nonconst1d ] again let @xmath11 ; this time let @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if we begin with @xmath6 we get : @xmath14 note that in this example block lengths are 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , ... , and the reader can verify that they will continue growing as fibonacci numbers .",
    "these examples illustrate the major distinction we make between substitutions . in the first example",
    ", the length of a substituted letter is always 3 and thus the size of any level-@xmath5 block must be @xmath15 ; this is a _ substitution of constant length_. in the second example the size of a substituted letter depends on the letter itself , and the size of a level-@xmath5 block is computed recursively ; this is a _ substitution of non - constant length_. this is the essence of the distinction between geometric and combinatorial tiling substitutions .",
    "it is interesting to consider infinite sequences of the form @xmath16 in @xmath17 .",
    "such a sequence is said to be _ admitted _ by the substitution if every finite block of letters is contained in some level-@xmath5 block . in the theory of dynamical systems , the space of all sequences admitted by the substitution is studied using the shift action @xmath18 ( basically , moving the decimal point one unit to the right ) .",
    "an interested reader should see @xcite to find out more .",
    "the most straightforward generalization to tilings of @xmath19 ( or @xmath0 ) is to use unit square tiles labeled ( colored ) by the alphabet @xmath1 .",
    "these tilings can be considered as sequences in @xmath20 , and substitutions can take letters to square or rectangular blocks of letters .",
    "we only need to ensure that all of the blocks  fit \" to form a sequence without gaps or overlaps .",
    "the constant length case is to expand each colored tile by some integer @xmath21 and then subdivide into @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) colored unit squares .",
    "a simple method for the non - constant length case is to take the direct product of one - dimensional substitutions of non - constant length .",
    "[ const2d ] let @xmath24 , where we represent @xmath25 as a white unit square tile and @xmath26 as a blue unit square tile .",
    "suppose the length expansion is 3 and that the tiles are substituted by a three - by - three array of tiles , colored as in figure [ square1 ] .",
    "starting with the blue level-0 tile , level-0 , level-1 , level-2 and level-3 tiles are shown in figure [ square2 ] .",
    "one sees in this example the tiling version of the rule creating the sierpinski carpet .",
    "[ nonconst2d ] this time , let the alphabet be @xmath27 ; for simplicity of notation we put @xmath28 .",

    "the characteristic  plaid \" appearance of the direct product is evident .",
    "some literature on @xmath29-dimensional symbolic substitutions exists . in the non - constant length case ,",

    "an extension of this idea , allowing substitutions with restrictions forcing the substitutions to  fit \" , are studied in @xcite . in the constant - length case",
    ", a partial survey and spectral analysis of this class from the dynamical systems viewpoint appears in @xcite . for those wishing to experiment with various substitutions of both constant and non - constant length",
    ", the author maintains a matlab freeware computer program that allows the user to generate these tilings of @xmath20 and manipulate them in several ways @xcite .",
    "let us introduce some terminology that will be useful throughout the paper .",
    "tile _ is a set @xmath30 that is the closure of its interior .",
    "we will always assume that tiles are bounded ; in the literature it is frequently assumed that tiles are connected or even homeomorphic to topological balls .",
    "in fact it is often required that the tiles be polygonal , but in substitution tiling theory tiles with fractal boundary occur naturally .",
    "when it is desirable to distinguish between congruent tiles they can be _ labeled _ ( also called _ marked _ or _ colored _ ) .",
    "two tiles are considered _ equivalent _ if they differ by a rigid motion and carry the same label .",
    "prototile set _ is a finite set @xmath31 of inequivalent tiles .",
    "given a prototile set @xmath31 , a _ tiling _ of @xmath0 is a set @xmath32 of tiles , each equivalent to a tile from @xmath31 , such that    1",
    ".   @xmath32 covers @xmath0 : @xmath33 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath32 packs @xmath0 : distinct tiles have non - intersecting interiors .",
    "a _ @xmath32-patch _ is a finite union of tiles with nonintersecting interiors covering a connected set ; two patches are equivalent if there is a rigid motion between them that matches up equivalent tiles .",
    "a tiling is said to be of _ finite local complexity ( flc ) _",
    "( also known as having a _ finite number of local patterns _ ) if there are only finitely many two - tile @xmath32-patches up to equivalence .",
    "a tiling is called _ repetitive _ ( also called _ almost periodic _ or the _ local isomorphism property _ ) if for any @xmath32-patch @xmath34 there is an @xmath35 such that in every ball of radius @xmath36 there is a patch equivalent to @xmath34 . in dynamical systems",
    "theory the most work has been done on repetitive tilings with finite local complexity .      given a tiling substitution ,",
    "it is possible to construct infinite tilings and tiling spaces from that substitution in a few different ways .",
    "( this is also true for symbolic substitutions )",
    ". our description will be necessarily imprecise as different substitutions can require different definitions of some of the terms ; we give the main ideas here and refer the reader to sources such as @xcite , and @xcite to get more details .    one way to get",
    "an infinite tiling is to begin with some initial block or tile and substitute ad infinitum . in many cases a limiting sequence or tiling @xmath37",
    "will exist .",
    "sometimes it will cover only a half - line , quarter - plane , or some other unbounded region of space , and sometimes it will cover the entire line or plane .",
    "a less constructive method is to define a tiling @xmath32 as _ admitted _ by the substitution if every finite configuration of tiles in @xmath32 is equivalent to a configuration found inside a level-@xmath5 tile , for some @xmath5 .",
    "the _ tiling space _ associated to a substitution is the set of all tilings admitted by that substitution .",
    "another way to obtain this space is to take the closure ( in a suitable metric ) of all rigid motions of a limiting tiling @xmath37 . in either case , a point in the tiling space @xmath38 is an infinite tiling , and any nontrivial rigid motion of that tiling is considered a different point in the tiling space .",
    "substitutions of constant length have a natural generalization to tilings in higher dimensions , which we introduce in section [ geom.section ] .",
    "these generalizations , which include the well - studied self - similar tilings , rely upon the use of linear expansion maps and are therefore rigidly geometric .",
    "we present examples in varying degrees of generality and include a selection of the major results in the field .",
    "extending substitutions of non - constant length to higher dimensions seems to be more difficult , and is the topic of section [ comb.section ] . to even define",
    "what this class contains has been problematic and there is not yet a consensus on the subject . for lack of existing terminology",
    "we have decided to call this type of substitution combinatorial as tiles are combined to create the substitutions without any geometric restriction save that they can be iterated without gaps or overlaps , and because in certain cases it is possible to define them in terms of their graph - theoretic structure .    in",
    "many cases one can transform combinatorial tiling substitutions into geometric ones through a limit process . in section [ connections.section ] , we will discuss how to do this and what the effects are to the extent that they are known .",
    "we conclude the paper by discussing several of the different ways substitution tilings can be studied , and what sorts of questions are of interest .",
    "although the idea had been around for several years , self - similar tilings of the plane were given a formal definition and introduced to the wider public by thurston in a series of four ams colloquium lectures , with lecture notes appearing thereafter @xcite . throughout the literature one finds varying degrees of generality and some commonly used restrictions .",
    "we make an effort to give precise definitions here , adding remarks which point out some of the differences in usage and in terminology .",
    "for the moment we assume that the only rigid motions allowed for equivalence of tiles are translations ; this follows @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we give the definitions as they appear in @xcite , which includes that of @xcite as a special case .",

    "combinatorial substitutions such as the rauzy substitution of example [ rauzy.cst ] are a natural place to look for examples of low - complexity sequences .",
    "some problems that have been at least partially resolved for geometric substitutions are still open for combinatorial ones .",
    "for instance it is completely unclear whether there should exist matching rules which force tiles to fit together as prescribed by combinatorial substitutions .",
    "would it be possible to use the matching rules for their associated self - similar tilings , which we know exist by @xcite , to find them ?",
    "another question is , since the connection to the atomic structure of solids is an important motivation for the study of tiling spaces , can we identify the diffraction or dynamical spectrum of combinatorial substitution ?",
    "it is known that the dynamical spectrum of the chacon substitution is trivial since it is weakly mixing @xcite , and following @xcite it is reasonable to conjecture that dpv substitutions without pisot expansions might also be weakly mixing .",
    "for combinatorial substitutions , is the spectrum largely dependent on the perron eigenvalue of the substitution matrix , as it is in the geometric case @xcite ? or is the situation like the one - dimensional symbolic case , which is also highly sensitive to the combinatorics of the substitutions ?      the first open question is , when does a combinatoral tiling substitution give rise to a reasonable geometric one ?",
    "we have already seen that the non - primitive chacon substitution of example [ chacon ] does not",
    ". there must be substitutions for which the limit in the replace - and - rescale method does not exist , or produces topologically unpleasant tiles .",
    "in fact , it is unclear exactly how the replace - and - rescale method ought to properly be applied : determining the appropriate linear expansion map is problematic for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the combinatorial substitution might be encoding an inflate - and - subdivide rule that does not inflate as a similarity .",
    "this means that knowing the volume expansion would not tell us the appropriate length expansions .",
    "second , if the linear map is a similarity , there may be some rotation inherent in the combinatorial substitution that would need to be expressed in the linear map , as in the rauzy substitution of example [ rauzy.cst ] .",
    "in the best circumstances we could hope to find conditions under which the expansion can be found , the limiting tiles are topologically  nice \" , and a proper inflate - and - subdivide rule exists .",
    "it is interesting to consider the relationship between the dual graphs of a combinatorial substitution and its associated geometric substitution ( if it exists ) .",
    "it is clear from figure [ dpv3 ] that the dual graphs must always have the same labeled vertices , but the edge and facet sets do not seem to bear a consistent relationship to one another . in the case of example",
    "[ fib.sst ] the edge set of the dpv s dual graph is contained in that of its self - similar tiling , but this is not true in general . since the unlabeled dual graphs are not isomorphic , there is no homeomorphism of the plane taking one to another ( see @xcite , p. 169 ) .",
    "can an understanding of the combinatorial properties of one tiling still give us insight into the other ?",
    "in one - dimensional symbolic dynamics , the curtis - lyndon - hedlund theorem ( see @xcite ) states that homeomorphisms between symbolic dynamical systems are equivalent to local maps called  sliding block codes \" .",
    "a sliding block code transforms one sequence into another element by element , deciding what to put in the new sequence by looking in a finite window in the old one .",
    "similarly , one tiling can be transformed locally into another ; if the process is invertible the tilings are mutually locally derivable .",
    "it has come to light that there is no curtis - lyndon - hedlund theorem for tiling dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "using the basic method of @xcite , one can show that example [ fib.dpv ] and the associated self - similar tiling of example [ fib.sst ] have topologically conjugate dynamical systems without the possibility of mutual local derivability .",
    "we conjecture that in the pisot case , combinatorial substitutions have topologically conjugate dynamical systems with their geometric counterparts . in general one would not expect the conjugacy to be through mutual local derivability .",
    "our final question takes note of the fact that the dynamical relationship between substitution sequences and self - similar tilings of the line is especially subtle . on a sequence space there is a @xmath153-action ; passing to a tiling by choosing tile lengths provides a natural action by @xmath47 called a  suspension \" .",
    "surprisingly , the continuous action of the tiling space is probably better understood than the discrete action ! for instance , the presence or absence , and nature of , eigenvalues of the tiling dynamical system can be understood in terms of the expansion constant along with certain geometric information @xcite .",
    "this situation is far more complicated in the symbolic case and the interested reader should see @xcite , section 7.3 for a synopsis .",
    "also , topological conjugacies between different suspensions have been thoroughly considered in @xcite , where it is seen that the eigenvalues of the substitution matrix play a critical role .",
    "we can consider tilings such as those in figure [ non - pisot3 ] as being suspensions of the same sequence in @xmath20 , and ask similar questions about their spectra and topological properties .",
    "more generally , we can consider tilings such as those in figure [ non - pisottriangles2 ] as being suspensions of the same labeled graph .",
    "this perspective yields an interesting set of problems at the intersection of dynamics and combinatorics .",
