    "the functional schrdinger picture is based on the projection of quantum states and operators on the field amplitude basis .",

    "a kernel is a quantum mechanical evolution operator in the functional schrdinger picture and is the fundamental object of any quantum mechanical theory .",
    "it represents a transition amplitude from an arbitrary initial state at time @xmath0 to an arbitrary final state at time @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it allows to calculate the forward time evolution of any given initial field configuration . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the kernel can be expressed solely in terms of the causal propagator and derivatives of the causal propagator thus elaborating further on the connection with the heisenberg ( operator ) picture for quantum field theories .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of the causal propagator makes the causality structure of the theory evident .",
    "the kernel allows for many physical applications in quantum field theory .",
    "for example , if interactions between various scalar fields or fermionic fields are linear in ( one of the ) matter fields , the formalism developed here can straightforwardly be applied .",
    "furthermore , another natural application of the kernel can be found in the study of decoherence @xcite accounting for the quantum - to - classical transition in the early universe .",
    "after having reviewed some basic quantum mechanics in the current section , we will calculate the kernel for a free scalar field in section [ the kernel in the non - interacting case ] , and a scalar field coupled to a source term in section [ the kernel in the interacting case ] in cosmological spacetimes ( spatially homogeneous backgrounds ) . in section [ causality in quantum mechanics ]",
    "we elaborate on causality in quantum field theory expressed in the functional schrdinger picture and end in section [ applications ] with some examples , to wit , the simple harmonic oscillator , the kernel in de sitter spacetime and the time evolution of the vacuum state in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker or flrw spacetimes .",
    "let us begin by recalling some basic identities from quantum mechanics .",
    "a quantum state @xmath2 at time @xmath1 can in general be expressed in terms of the evolution operator @xmath3 and the quantum state @xmath4 at initial time @xmath0 as follows : latexmath:[\\[\\label{evolution }    @xmath2 , the evolution operator @xmath3 obeys the schrdinger equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian operator of the system under consideration .",

    "we can easily infer some important properties the evolution operator satisfies :    [ evolutionproperties ] @xmath13      let us now state a relation between quantum mechanical expectation values and commutators ( see for example @xcite ) which will play an important rle in the interpretation of the kernel .",
    "we consider the expectation value of some general operator @xmath14 in the schrdinger picture : @xmath15 now , by using ( [ evolution : solution ] ) for the evolution operator : @xmath16 one can prove by induction that at each order in @xmath7 one has : @xmath17 \\cdots\\right]\\right]\\right|\\psi(t')\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] we can conclude that expectation values , naturally defined in terms of evolution operators as in ( [ expectationvalueq2 ] ) , can in a fully equivalent manner be calculated from the expectation value of nested commutators , as in ( [ expectationvalueq3 ] ) .",

    "corresponds to the statement that all commutators of observables , including non - commuting observables , vanish outside past and future light cones .",
    "alternatively , measurements performed at points in spacetime with a spacelike separation can be carried out simultaneously .",
    "this equivalence relation already suggests that quantum mechanics is a causal theory in full generality since , up to higher order irreducible @xmath18-point functions , expectation values can be expressed in terms of the commutator , a manifestly causal quantity .",
    "these are vital observations , and we will return to them shortly .      given some quantum field operator @xmath19 in the heisenberg picture one can construct various vacuum expectation values by means of the schwinger - keldysh formalism ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will be interested in a particular linear combination of the two wightman functions ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) to construct what we will henceforth refer to as the causal propagator : @xmath22\\right| \\omega\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\left\\langle\\omega\\left|\\hat{\\phi}(x ) \\hat{\\phi}(x ' ) - \\hat{\\phi}(x ' ) \\hat{\\phi}(x ) \\right|\\omega\\right\\rangle \\,.\\ ] ] in particular , if we assume a spatially homogeneous background and a quadratic hamiltonian , expanding in terms of creation and annihilation operators : @xmath23 yields : @xmath24 where : @xmath25 here , the @xmath26 originates from imposing the standard commutation relations between creation and annihilation operators .",
    "furthermore , note the field modes are homogeneous , i.e. : @xmath27 depends on @xmath28 .",

    "hence we can absorb this factor into the overall normalisation of the kernel : @xmath60\\,.\\ ] ] next , we fourier expand the classical field : @xmath61 which is well defined because we consider a spatially flat flrw background .",

    "we must keep in mind though , that also the field modes are classical in the sense that they obey the fourier transform of equation of motion ( [ motionphi ] ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the hubble parameter .",

    "let us denote the two fundamental solutions of ( [ motionphi2 ] ) by @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "the sign - function is introduced in order to preserve the odd symmetry under @xmath78 .",
    "one can thus express the solution to differential equation ( [ motionphi2 ] ) in terms of its boundary conditions and causal propagators exclusively .",
    "we believe that this is also true for general spacetimes and fields of non - zero spin  @xcite .",

    "the functional schrdinger equation reads : @xmath93 after switching to fourier space , we write @xmath94 .",

    "the result for @xmath139 is hence unchanged compared to the free case ( [ propkernelconstm ] ) .",

    "the functional schrdinger picture shows that the evolution of correlators can be fully expressed in terms of causal propagators and initial state only .",
    "this is to be contrasted to out - of - equilibrium field theories in heisenberg picture , where often one reads that in non - equilibrium problems there are two independent two point functions : the spectral function ( causal propagator , commutator ) and the statistical propagator ( anticommutator ) .",
    "employing the definitions of the occurring functions in terms of the fundamental solutions in equations ( [ propkernelconst ] ) and ( [ vacuumwavefunctional2 ] ) , allows us to even further simplify this result to obtain : @xmath193\\right|\\omega\\right\\rangle & = & \\hbar \\int\\frac{d^{3}\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } g_{\\mathbf{k}}(t_{1},t_{2})\\mathrm{sgn}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{n } } ) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x } ' ) } \\\\ & = & \\hbar \\int\\frac{d^{3}\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } g_{c}(k , t_{1},t_{2})e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x } ' ) } \\nonumber \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it should be .",
    "we have used identity ( [ causalproplinkgprop ] ) , which establishes the link with the heisenberg picture fields . note that the wightman functions in ( [ vacuumexpvalufuncschrodinger3 ] ) depend on the initial state through @xmath182 whereas the causal propagator does not .",
    "hence , we have shown that the kernel although developed in fourier space , preserves the causal structure in terms of light cones in position space .",
    "concluding , since the commutator is causal and the kernel is expressed solely in terms of this causal quantity , quantum mechanics in de sitter spacetime is fully causal .",
    "this is in contrast to claims made , for example , in @xcite .",
    "apart from @xcite , the claims in the literature  @xcite are based on considering single particle quantum mechanics , in contrast to the functional schrdinger picture used in the present work .",
    "this means that causality of quantum mechanics can be fully appreciated only within the context of ( relativistic ) quantum field theory , and can lead to misleading results when viewed within the one particle formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "if initial and final times are equal , the kernel  ( [ propkernel][propkernelconst ] ) reduces to a delta - function , i.e. : there is no propagation of the field .",
    "if both times differ , propagation is dictated by the commutator propagator and hence causality is preserved in general in quantum mechanics .",
    "note finally that equations ( [ expectationvalueq2 ] ) and ( [ expectationvalueq3 ] ) support this statement .",
    "although we have proved this consistency in de sitter spacetime explicitly , we have no reason to believe that our result does not hold in flrw and more general spacetimes .",
    "in fact , one could take the region in spacetime where the commutator ( [ vacuumexpvalufuncschrodinger4 ] ) vanishes as the definition for light cones in general spacetimes .     ]    _ _",
    "to illustrate the applicability of the kernel , we will turn our attention to three explicit examples .",
    "we construct the kernel in both minkowski and pure de sitter spacetimes , where in the former case one can recognise the simple harmonic oscillator kernel .",
    "finally , we will examine the evolution of the vacuum state for a non - interacting hamiltonian in general flrw spacetimes .",
    "consider the simple harmonic oscillator toy model .",
    "let us take the minkowski metric , i.e. : we set @xmath194 in the flrw metric . in the minimally coupled case ( @xmath195 ) , the equation of motion that the field modes @xmath180 obey follows from ( [ motionphi2 ] ) as : @xmath196 where @xmath197 . if we choose our fundamental solution of this equation of motion to be : @xmath198 then this solution obeys the correct symmetry properties . note that this choice is consistent with the wronskian normalisation condition ( [ wronskian ] ) .",
    "again , we could have chosen an even more general solution of the form @xmath199 and require @xmath184 .",
    "the fourier transform of the causal propagator defined in ( [ commutatorpropagatorf ] ) is hence given by : @xmath200 the kernel for the simple harmonic oscillator follows as : @xmath201 \\,.\\ ] ] if we let @xmath202 this is indeed in agreement with standard quantum mechanical results .",
    "it reproduces for example @xcite where @xmath203 .      as a second example we consider the kernel for the inflationary de sitter universe @xcite",
    "the solution of ( [ motionphi2 ] ) in conformal time is thus given by : @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 are two coefficients and : @xmath207 @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the hankel functions of the first and second kind , respectively , at order @xmath159 , see equation ( [ actions ] ) .",
    "the causal propagator now follows as : @xmath210 \\mathrm{sgn}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{n } } ) \\,.\\ ] ] the causal propagator in turn fully determines our kernel  ( [ propkernel ] ) .      as a final example",
    ", we can apply the kernel to an initial vacuum state for some non - interacting scalar field .",
    "thus , initially , we start with a vacuum state @xmath4 and calculate its forward time evolution according to standard quantum mechanical lore ( [ evolution ] ) .",
    "we employ the functional schrdinger picture as before and arrive at : @xmath211 we can now conveniently exploit equation ( [ propkernel ] ) for the kernel in the non - interacting case .",
    "the gaussian vacuum wave functional is given by ( [ vacuumwavefunctional ] ) . in order to perform the functional integral in ( [ vacuumevolution ] )",
    ", we switch to fourier space , complete the square and arrive at the following intermediate result : @xmath212.\\ ] ] now we insert the definition of the causal propagator and the wronskian in terms of the fundamental solutions . indeed , one can show that the expression above reduces to the vacuum at time @xmath1 : @xmath213 and furthermore : @xmath214 as desired .",
    "we constructed the kernel for a scalar field in flrw spacetimes in two cases : a free field ( [ propkernel ] ) and one coupled to a source term ( [ propkernels ] ) .",
    "we showed that these kernels can be expressed solely in terms of the causal propagator and derivatives of the causal propagator .",
    "we have applied the general formalism to three examples , the simple harmonic oscillator kernel ( [ shopropagatorkernelfull ] ) , the kernel in de sitter spacetime and the evolution of the gaussian vacuum wave functional ( [ vacuumevolution2 ] ) .    in our analysis",
    "the causal structure of quantum field theory in the functional schrdinger picture is manifest .",
    "we have shown that the causal propagator , given by the vacuum expectation value of the commutator , forms the essential function in terms of which the functional kernel is expressed . therefore , our functional schrdinger picture analysis reproduces the standard ( heisenberg picture ) causality structure of flrw spacetimes .",
