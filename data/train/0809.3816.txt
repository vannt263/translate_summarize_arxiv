    "the classical problem in the calculus of variations consists in minimizing the functional @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a given convex function and @xmath5 is a family of admissible functions @xmath6 ( typically the elements of a functional space satisfying a boundary condition @xmath7 on @xmath8 ) . in general",
    "it is not hard to show the existence and uniqueness for this problem , but the main difficulty arises when trying to prove further smoothness properties of the minimizers . for example , one would like to show that a minimizer has continuous second derivatives .",
    "then it satisfies the euler - lagrange equation @xmath9    hilbert s 19th problem posed at the beginning of the last century refers precisely to this question of regularity : _ are the solutions of regular problems in the calculus of variations always necessarily analytic ? _    in two dimensions the problem was solved in 1943 by c.b .",
    "morrey @xcite who showed analyticity of solutions by the use of complex analysis and quasiconformal mappings .",
    "a partial answer to hilbert s problem in the general case was given in the 1930s by the use of schauder s estimates for linear equations @xcite,@xcite , which guarantee that minimizers are smooth once they have hlder continuous derivatives .",
    "on the other hand it follows from the comparison principle that minimizers are lipschitz continuous under quite general conditions on the domain and boundary data .",
    "one piece of the puzzle remained to be proved : that lipschitz minimizers are in fact @xmath10 .",
    "the breakthrough came in the 1950s from the work of e. de giorgi @xcite on the minimal surface equation and independently from j. nash @xcite . differentiating the equation ( [ el  ] ) with respect to @xmath11",
    "we see that the derivative @xmath12 satisfies the nonlinear elliptic pde @xmath13 ignoring the dependence on @xmath14 we can write that @xmath15 satisfies the linear equation @xmath16 de giorgi observed that the uniform ellipticity condition @xmath17_{i , j } \\le \\lambda i\\ ] ] on the coefficients is sufficient to obtain continuity for @xmath18 ( in fact hlder continuity due to scaling ) .",
    "the proof is based on an iteration scheme for various caccioppoli type inequalities of the form @xmath19 this result led to extensive study of the theory of linear second order elliptic equations with measurable coefficients ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    with the question of regularity being understood in the case",
    "when @xmath2 is smooth and strictly uniformly convex , it is natural to further investigate what happens when the uniform ellipticity condition on @xmath20 fails on a certain set . in the particular case of the @xmath21-laplace equation , i.e @xmath22 , @xmath23 , when the degeneracy set consists of only one point ( the origin ) the regularity of minimizers is well - understood ( see fore example @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we direct our attention to the case when the degeneracy set of @xmath2 can possibly be very large .",
    "the first step towards proving regularity of minimizers would be obtaining @xmath0 continuity .",
    "then the euler lagrange equation becomes less ambiguous and the classical theory can be applied near the points whose gradients lie outside the degeneracy set of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath24 denotes the legendre transform of @xmath2 then @xmath25 thus @xmath24 is a particular solution of the nonlinear pde ( [ 1  ] ) . without further evidence",
    "we can ask wether or not minimizers have the same regularity as @xmath24 . in particular : _ is it true that if @xmath2 is strictly convex then lipschitz minimizers are of class @xmath0 ? _ this seems to be a difficult question but there is some evidence that suggests that the result might be true at least in two dimensions .    in the first part of the paper we prove _ a priori _ estimates that answer the question above in two dimensions for two large classes of strictly convex functionals .",

    "let us briefly explain the connection between our problem and these results .",
    "we present the simplest model of a random surface . for small",
    "@xmath41 consider the points @xmath42 , and call the @xmath43 direction vertical and the plane @xmath44 horizontal .",
    "an _ @xmath41-stepped surface _ is a polygonal surface whose faces are squares in the 2-skeleton of @xmath45 and which is a graph in the vertical direction . in other words ,",
    "the subgraph of an @xmath41-stepped surface is a collection of @xmath41-cubes of @xmath45 .",
    "obviously , stepped surfaces can approximate only lipschitz graphs with gradients lying in the equilateral triangle @xmath46 with vertices given by the slopes of the three planes @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "consider the  random surfaces \" given by all @xmath41- stepped surfaces above a domain @xmath50 which stay @xmath51 away from a given function @xmath52 defined on @xmath8 . in connection with problems that arise in statistical mechanics ,",
    "it is interesting to investigate the limiting behavior as @xmath53 .",
    "cohn , kenyon and propp @xcite proved that as @xmath53 the random surfaces almost surely converge uniformly to a nonrandom function @xmath31 which solves the variational problem @xmath54 the surface tension @xmath55 can be computed from combinatorial considerations and is strictly convex in the interior of @xmath46 and constant on @xmath56 .",
    "the picture of such a random surface is shown in figure 1 and it appeared on the cover of the notices of the ams , march 2005 , volume 52 .",
    "other types of random surfaces can be obtained from random tiling of the plane with various geometric figures .",
    "for example there is a one to one correspondence between the tilings with @xmath57 rhombi of an @xmath41- honeycomb lattice and the @xmath58- stepped surfaces : the tilings are the projections of the faces ( squares ) along the vertical direction onto the plane @xmath59 .",
    "more generally , one can construct random surfaces corresponding to random perfect matchings ( also called _ dimer configurations _ ) on a weighted , bipartite , periodic , planar graph @xmath60 .",
    "kenyon , okounkov and sheffield @xcite showed that these random surfaces converge _ a.s .",
    "_ to a solution of ( [ 100 ] ) with @xmath2 and the polygon @xmath46 ( called the newton polygon ) depending on @xmath60",
    ". the function @xmath2 can be explicitly computed and minimizers of for this @xmath2 and for a special class of domains and boundary data were studied by kenyon and okounkov @xcite using techniques from algebraic geometry .    in particular",
    "@xmath2 is piecewise linear on @xmath56 , strictly convex in the interior , smooth except at a finite number of points where it can have singularities .    in the second part of this paper",
    "we investigate precisely the @xmath0 regularity of minimizers of ( [ 100 ] ) for an arbitrary functional @xmath2 which is , in the interior of a polygon @xmath46 , strictly convex and smooth except at a finite number of points , but without any further assumptions about the behavior of @xmath2 on @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the set of degeneracy of @xmath20 is the union of a finite set with @xmath56 .",
    "the variational problem ( [ 100 ] ) is equivalent to an obstacle problem .",
    "indeed , let @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) be the minimum ( maximum ) of all admissible functions @xmath31 and define @xmath2 to be @xmath63 outside @xmath64 , then problem ( [ 100 ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath65 the obstacle problem has been extensively studied for the laplace equation i.e @xmath66 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the regularity of minimizers in our case is quite delicate . near the points where the solution separates from the obstacle",
    "the equation becomes degenerate .",
    "moreover , even in the set where @xmath67 it can not be concluded ( as in laplace equation case ) that @xmath14 is in the interior of @xmath46 .",
    "thus the results from the first part of the paper can not be directly applied in any reasonable set .",
    "our main regularity result says that the minimizers are @xmath0 in @xmath30 except on a number of segments which have an end point on @xmath8 and have directions perpendicular to the sides of @xmath46 . on these segments",
    "the minimizer coincides with either the lower or the upper obstacle .",

    "we also prove a type of continuity result at the points where the minimizer is not differentiable .",
    "we show that if a sequence of points converges to a point of non - differentiability then their corresponding gradients approach @xmath56 ( see theorem [ continuous ] ) .    as seen in figure 1 , minimizers of ( [ 100 ] ) may have  flat \" regions where they are linear and their gradient belongs to the set of vertices of @xmath46 .",
    "we show that these regions must lie between a convex and a concave graph ( see theorem [ convex ] ) .",
    "the proof of our results relies on two dimensional techniques . for the results in the first part we prove weak versions of caccioppoli inequalities in which the right hand side of ( [ cacc ] ) is replaced by a constant",
    "this is done using the precise form of the nonlinearity in equation ( [ 1  ] ) . as it turns out ,",
    "such inequalities are sufficient for proving @xmath0 continuity .",
    "the second part of the paper is more involved .",
    "we use the ideas of the first part and an approximation technique together with the fact that any tangent plane splits the graph of a smooth minimizer into at least four connected components .",
    "these methods could be exploited further to include other examples of functionals , however most examples would satisfy our assumptions .",
    "as in the work of de giorgi the key step in proving @xmath0 continuity consists in obtaining  localization \" lemmas ( see lemmas [ a1 ] , [ a2 ] , [ on ] , and theorem [ localization ] ) . roughly speaking , they say that when we restrict to smaller and smaller domains the image of the gradient restricts itself to either one of two known sets ( that decompose the plane ) .",
