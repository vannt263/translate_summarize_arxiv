    "the general solution for an asymptotically flat black hole in the einstein - maxwell theory is given by the kerr - newman solution .",
    "it describes an electrically charged rotating black hole with its three parameters : mass , charge and angular momentum .",
    "a systematic study of the fields dynamic in the vicinity of a black hole is essential for understanding black - hole evaporation , quasinormal modes and stability .",
    "the linear dynamics of a charged massive scalar field in the background of a charged black hole is characterized by the two dimensionless parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a black hole is not believed to be formed possessing considerable electric charge , and , once it is formed , it undergoes a rather quick discharging @xcite . yet , even if a black hole has a very small charge of order @xmath7 , the parameter @xmath1 need not be small .",
    "in addition , a charge induced by an external magnetic field , may be formed at the surface of an initially neutral , but rotating black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , the complete analysis of a massive charged scalar field dynamics should include consideration of the whole range of values @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "in this work we shall study the stability and evolution of perturbation of a massive charged scalar field in the kerr - newman background in terms of its _ quasinormal modes _ and _ asymptotic tails _ at late times .",
    "it is believed that if the quasinormal modes are damped , the system under consideration is stable , though a rigorous mathematical proof of stability is usually complicated and sometimes includes a nontrivial analysis of the initial value problem . by now , quite a few papers have been devoted to scalar field perturbations in the black - hole background , yet , while the behavior of the massless neutral scalar field is indeed very well studied , the quasinormal modes of charged fields was studied only in the regime @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite , except for @xcite , where the wkb estimation for quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of a massless charged scalar field around the reissner - nordstrm black hole was given in the regime @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the multipole number . the complete analysis of quasinormal modes ( allowing also to judge about stability ) for a massive charged scalar field _ for arbitrary values _ @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath0 has been lacking so far not only for the kerr - newman , but even for reissner - nordstrm solutions .",
    "here we shall solve this problem by adopting the two numerical methods of computation ( the frobenius method and the time - domain integrations ) based on convergent procedures , which allow us to find quasinormal modes accurately and with no restriction on the parameters of the system .",
    "perturbation of a charged massive field in the background of a rotating charged black hole has rich physics , because there are a number of phenomena which must be taken into consideration :    * _ superradiance _ , that is the amplification of waves with particular frequencies reflected by a black hole , if it is rotating @xcite or electrically charged @xcite .",
    "thus , there will be the two regimes of superradiance for kerr - newman black holes , owing to charge and rotation @xcite . * _ superradiant instability _ of bound states around black holes owing to the massive term , which creates a local minimum far from the black hole , so that the wave will be reflected repeatedly and can grow .",
    "it is essential that this instability occurs under the bound states boundary condition , which differ from the quasinormal modes ones @xcite . * _ quasiresonances .",
    "_ when a field is massive , quasinormal modes with arbitrarily long lifetimes , called quasiresonances , appear , once some critical value of mass of the field is achieved @xcite .",
    "when the damping rate goes to zero , the quasinormal asymptotically approach the bound state , but still remain quasinormal modes for whatever small but nonzero damping . @xcite . *",
    "_ instability of the extremal black holes _ that apparently occurs for fields of any spin and both for extremal reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes @xcite , and therefore , must be expected for the extremal kerr - newman solution as well .",
    "however , in the linear approximation this instability develops only on the event horizon and can not be seen by an external observer . * _ mode branching_. quasinormal modes of kerr black holes",
    "were believed to be completely studied until a few months ago when an interesting observation has been made @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for the near - extremal rotation there are two distinct sets of damped quasinormal modes , which merge to a single set in the exactly extremal state @xcite .    here ,",
    "through the numerical analysis of quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails we have shown that a massive charged scalar field is stable in the vicinity of the kerr - newman black hole , in spite of the instability of the corresponding bound states .",
    "we found that at some values of the field s charge @xmath3 quasinormal modes may behave qualitatively differently from those of the neutral field : the fundamental mode ( dominating at late times ) may have arbitrarily small real part ( real oscillation frequency ) which appears in the time domain as a very short period of quasinormal ringing consisting of damped oscillations and the quick onset of asymptotic power - law tails .",
    "in addition , we generalized earlier results on mode branching of massless fields around nearly extremal kerr black holes to the massive fields and kerr - newman solutions .",
    "an analytic formula has been obtained for large @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii the basic formulas for a charged massive scalar field in the kerr - newman background is given .",
    "the wave equation is reduced to the schrdinger - like form with an effective potential .",
    "sec iii describes the numerical methods which we used : the frobenius methods , two schemes of time - domain integration ( for neutral and charged fields ) together with the method for extraction of frequencies from the time - domain profiles , called the prony method , and the wkb approach .",
    "we have related separately perturbations of nonextremal black holes ( sec iv ) and nearly and exactly extremal ones ( sec .",
    "v ) , as near extremal black holes shows new phenomena , such as mode branching . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss some technical difficulties which appear when one considers higher overtones of a charged scalar field or approach closely to the extremal state , keeping @xmath3 non zero . in sec vii",
    "we summarize the results obtained .",
    "in the boyer - lindquist coordinates the kerr - newman metric has the form @xmath13 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath5 is the black - hole charge , @xmath4 is its mass .",
    "the electromagnetic background of the black hole is given by the four - vector potential , @xmath16 we shall parameterize the metric by the following three parameters : the event horizon @xmath17 , the inner horizon @xmath18 , and the rotation parameter @xmath19 , @xmath20 the black hole s mass and charge are then @xmath21    a massive charged scalar field satisfies the klein - gordon equation , @xmath22 where @xmath3 and @xmath2 are the field s charge and mass respectively .",
    "one separates variables by the following ansatz @xmath23 where @xmath24 obeys the following equation @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the separation constant .",
    "this equation can be solved numerically for any value of @xmath27 in the same way as the equation for a massive scalar field in the kerr black - hole background @xcite .",
    "let us note that , when @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ angularpart ] ) can be reduced to the well - known equation for the spheroidal functions . in this case , for any fixed value of @xmath27 the separation constant @xmath26 can be found numerically using the continued fraction method @xcite . when the effective mass is not zero , the separation constant @xmath29 can be expressed , in terms of the eigenvalue for spheroidal functions @xmath30 @xcite , as @xmath31 when @xmath32 , one has @xmath33 . for nonzero values of @xmath19 ,",
    "the separation constant can be enumerated by the integer multipole number @xmath34 .",
    "the radial function satisfies a schrdinger equation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the tortoise coordinate , @xmath37 and the effective potential is @xmath38    the asymptotics of the effective potential near the event horizon and at spatial infinity are @xmath39 where we fix the sign of @xmath40 such that @xmath41 is of the same sign as @xmath42 .",
    "note , that @xmath43 and @xmath42 can have different signs .",
    "this corresponds to the superradiant regime in which one has @xmath44    by definition , quasinormal modes ( qnms ) are proper oscillation frequencies which correspond to purely incoming wave at the event horizon and purely outgoing wave at infinity , so that no incoming waves from either of the `` infinities '' are allowed .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions for the qnms can be written as follows @xmath45",
    "here , we shall briefly relate the three numerical methods used for finding quasinormal frequencies :    * leaver method , which is based on a convergent procedure and , thereby , allowing one to find qn modes accurately , * wkb method ( accurate in the regime of high multipole numbers ) , * time - domain integration which includes contribution of all modes , and , together with the prony method , usually allows extracting a few lower dominant frequencies from a time - domain profile .",
    "we shall see that in some ranges of parameters , when one method becomes slowly convergent or inapplicable , the other can be used , so that the use of a few alternative methods is necessary here not only for an additional checking , but also for getting the complete picture of quasinormal modes and stability in the full range of parameters .",
    "equation ( [ radialpart ] ) has an irregular singularity at spatial infinity and four regular singularities at @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the appropriate frobenius series is determined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the hawking temperature @xmath52 the function @xmath53 must be regular at the horizon and spatial infinity , so that the series in the vicinity of the event horizon @xmath54 satisfies both these requirements .",
    "this series converges everywhere outside the event horizon ( @xmath55 ) . when boundary conditions ( [ boundary - conditions ] ) are satisfied , that is when @xmath27 is a quasinormal ( qn ) frequency , the series convergence also at the spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath56 satisfy the three - term recurrence relation .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 can be found in an analytic form .    by comparing the ratio of the series coefficients @xmath61we",
    "obtain an equation with a convergent _ infinite continued fraction _ on its right side : @xmath62which can be solved numerically by minimizing the absolute value of the difference between its left- and right - hand sides .",
    "equation ( [ continued_fraction ] ) has an infinite number of roots , but the most stable root depends on @xmath63 .",
    "the larger number @xmath63 corresponds to the larger imaginary part of the root @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "as we study qnms with slower decay rate , we usually choose @xmath64 . in order to improve convergence of the infinite continued fraction for nonzero mass of a scalar field",
    ", we use the nollert procedure @xcite .      as for the study of mode branching we are also interested in modes with high multipole numbers ,",
    "the wkb approach is useful here , which is accurate in the eikonal regime @xmath65 and usually provides very good accuracy at moderate @xmath66 .",
    "the wkb formula for calculation of qnms has the following form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the values of the effective potential ( [ effective - potential ] ) and its second derivative with respect to the tortoise coordinate @xmath36 at the potential s peak .",
    "the terms @xmath70 depend on higher derivatives of @xmath71 at its maximum , and @xmath63 labels the overtones .",
    "the wkb approach was developed by schutz and will @xcite and later extended to higher orders @xcite . since there is implicit dependence on @xmath27 ( either through the separation constant @xmath26 for nonvanishing rotation or due to the @xmath1 coupling in the effective potential ( [ effective - potential ] ) ) , one has to search for the roots of equation ( [ wkbformula ] ) by minimizing the absolute value of the difference between its left and right sides .      for nonrotating black holes we are able to construct a time - dependent profile of the wave function at a fixed @xmath36 .",
    "the recently found instability of the exactly extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite makes it important to check stability of the nearly and exactly extremal black holes .",
    "even when the frobenius method finds no growing quasinormal modes , one could think that the growing modes were simply missed in the frequency domain at the stage of search for the roots of the equation with continued fractions eq .",
    "( [ continued_fraction ] ) , or , that a different boundary condition should be imposed at the event horizon in the extremal case . in order to eliminate both these suspicions , we will use the numerical characteristic integration method in time domain . here",
    ", two different schemes of integration were used for _ neutral _ and _ charged _ fields .    * a scheme for a neutral field . *",
    "the wave equation can be written in time - dependent form as follows : @xmath72 the technique of integration of the above wave equation in the time domain was developed in @xcite .",
    "the method uses the light - cone variables @xmath73 , @xmath74 , so that the wave equation reads @xmath75 the initial data are specified on the two null surfaces @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "acting by the time evolution operator @xmath78 on @xmath79 and taking account of ( [ light - cone ] ) , one finds @xmath80 where one introduced letters to mark the points as follows : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "equation ( [ integration - scheme ] ) allows us to calculate the values of @xmath79 inside the rhombus , which is built on the two null - surfaces @xmath85 and @xmath86 , starting from the initial data specified on them . as a result we can find the time profile data @xmath87 in each point of the rhombus .",
    "the time - domain integration includes a contribution from all overtones , and , thus , missing some mode is excluded .",
    "this method is based on the scattering of the gaussian wave on the potential barrier and therefore does not specify the boundary condition on the event horizon , so that the potentially missed instability due to possibly different boundary conditions must be also discarded .    * a scheme for a charged field .",
    "* when the scalar field is charged , an extra term containing the first derivative in time appears . therefore , a different integration scheme is required .",
    "we shall use the finite difference scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "first we rewrite the wave - like equation ( [ radialpart ] ) for the reissner - nordstrm black hole ( @xmath32 ) in the time - dependent form @xmath88 where @xmath89 following @xcite , one can derive the evolution of @xmath79 in an isosceles triangle with the base on the axis @xmath36 , where initial conditions are imposed .",
    "then , one has @xmath90 indexes @xmath91 and @xmath92 enumerate , respectively , the coordinates @xmath93 and @xmath36 of the grid : @xmath94 we choose the initial conditions again as a gaussian distribution whose maximum is near the maximum of the effective potential .",
    "since von neumann stability conditions require @xmath95 , in this scheme we chose @xmath96 . in order to achieve convergence",
    "we decrease @xmath97 .",
    "note , that as @xmath1 grows the convergence becomes seemingly slower , requiring smaller @xmath97 , what increases the computation time . when @xmath98 this scheme is reduced to the one above for the neutral field , yet , the codes for both schemes differ , so that letting @xmath98 in the mathematica code for the second scheme leads to a much longer computing than the first scheme .",
    "* prony method for mode extraction .",
    "* once a time domain profile is found , one can extract dominant frequencies from it with the help of the prony method .",
    "we fit the profile data by superposition of damped exponents @xmath99 and look for the convergence of the obtained frequencies at the increasing @xmath100 .",
    "we shall show that although the fit works well for the neutral scalar field , it can not be effectively used once modes with very small @xmath42 dominate in the spectrum at late times .",
    "in the regime of large @xmath1 and nonextremal @xmath5 , the frobenius method allows us to find an approximate analytic expression for the quasinormal frequencies .",
    "when @xmath101 one can observe that @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "then , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ continued_fraction ] ) as @xmath105 considering @xmath106 , from ( [ continued_fraction_qq ] ) we find that @xmath107 .",
    "we observe that @xmath108 when @xmath109 .",
    "then , we can write down @xmath26 as @xmath110 and find the asymptotic formula for the qnms @xmath111 here @xmath112 is the overtone number . from the data given in fig .",
    "[ figasymptot ] one can find that @xmath113 for @xmath114 . in order to find @xmath115 as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath116 we have analyzed numerically the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue of ( [ angularpart ] ) and found that @xmath117 + 2,\\ ] ] where the brackets denote the integer part .    when @xmath5 is not very close to its extremal value , the above analytical formula ( in the limit of vanishing rotation ) can be verified by the time - domain integration for a few lower modes , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ figworotation ] .",
    "there one can see that the analytic formula ( [ asymptotical_frequency ] ) works very well already at moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , even though we are able to obtain a stable time - domain profile for any values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , the prony method does not converge for high overtones as well as near extremal black holes .",
    "we shall discuss this in detail in the last section .",
    "for @xmath32 ( [ asymptotical_frequency ] ) coincides with the asymptotic formula found in @xcite in the regime @xmath118 with the help of the wkb approximation . unlike @xcite in our calculations",
    "one does not need to be limited by the regime @xmath119 .",
    "it is well known that due to a symmetry of the kerr - newman metric ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) quasinormal modes of a neutral scalar field come in within a degenerate pair @xmath122 when the scalar field is charged , in addition to ( [ degeneration ] ) one needs to take @xmath123 for the symmetry to be restored .",
    "that is why we study only qnms with positive real parts .",
    "the degeneration ( [ degeneration ] ) does not exist as soon as the coupling @xmath1 is not zero ( figs .  [ figworotation ] and [ figrotation ] )",
    ". then , at negative values of @xmath1 , the mode with a positive real part has slower decay rate than the one with the negative one ( while for positive @xmath1 the situation is opposite ) .",
    "moreover , when the absolute value of @xmath1 increases ( figs .",
    "[ figworotation ] and [ figrotation ] ) , the real oscillation frequency ( given by @xmath42 ) approaches zero and then the mode `` disappears '' from the spectrum at @xmath1 larger than some critical value .",
    "such disappearing of a mode in some range of parameters is not unusual and happens , for example , for arbitrarily long living modes ( quasiresonances ) of a massive neutral scalar field @xcite .",
    "we observe that at asymptotically late times , a neutral massless scalar field decays as @xmath124 in concordance with @xcite , while for the charged massless field , the dominant asymptotical tail is @xmath125 as it was first found in @xcite . \"",
    "note , that in the regime of large @xmath8 the correction formula to ( [ chargedtail ] ) was reported in @xcite , which might be correct , and , then , should appear at larger values of @xmath8 than those we considered in the numerical time - domain evolution here .",
    "the late - time tails in the background of the extremally charged black hole obey the same law ( see fig .",
    "[ figtailsextr ] ) . at",
    "intermediately late times , _ a massive charged _ scalar field decay as ( see fig .  [ figasympttailsmassive ] ) @xmath126 while at asymptotically late times , the decay law is @xmath127    thus , the power laws of a massive charged scalar field s decay at intermediate and asymptotically late times do not depend on multipole @xmath12 or charges @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the same law was obtained in @xcite for the massive dirac field .",
    "we suppose thereby that the asymptotic behavior of the charged massive fields does not depend on spin .",
    "the decaying time - domain profiles for various values of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 show that no instability exist for nonextremal reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "the complementary frequency domain data gives no indication of growing modes when the rotation is not vanishing .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there are no signs of instability for a massive charged scalar field in the nonextremal kerr - newman background under the quasinormal modes boundary conditions .",
    "we shall measure all quantities in units of @xmath128 , that is we take @xmath129 . in order to keep staying near the extremal state ,",
    "it is sufficient to keep @xmath130 close to @xmath128 .",
    "here we shall start from the generalization of level plots of @xcite , which show the branching of modes . in @xcite",
    "it was found that , in the near - extremal kerr limit , zero - damped mode ( zdm ) satisfies @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 .    therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the same multipole @xmath12 and azimuthal @xmath116 numbers were chosen as in @xcite . in fig .",

    "we can see that at some near - extremal @xmath130 , and @xmath19 , which starts from @xmath134 until its extremal value , the new branch of modes appears : the two branches of modes , which take place for high rotation ( @xmath135 ) , merge into a single one at slower rotation ( @xmath136 ) . as it is expected , for small values of black hole s",
    "charge @xmath5 , the obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] zero - damped mode is close to the one described by eq .",
    "( [ eqhod2 ] ) .",
    "the mode branching is owing to extremal rotation and not owing to extremal charge .",
    "indeed , a neutral scalar field around the near - extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole shows no mode branching .",
    "we have checked that the time - domain profile of scalar and gravitational perturbations of the exactly extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole consists of damped quasinormal oscillations , what proves stability of the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution from the point of view of an external observer , because 1 ) the profile includes contribution from all the modes , so that none can be missed , 2 ) the method of calculations does not imply any specific boundary conditions at the event horizon .",
    "this does not contradict a special instability of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite as this instability develops only on the event horizon and can not be observed by an external observer @xcite .",
    ".fundamental quasinormal modes ( @xmath114 ) of the scalar field for the extremal kerr - newman black hole ( @xmath137 ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also showed that the decay of a scalar field ( be it charged or neutral , massive or massless ) is dominated by the power - law tails ( see table ( [ tail - summary ] ) ) which are the same for the nonextremal black hole as for the extremal one .",
    "here we have considered an already formed black hole and the perturbation propagating outside of it , while the modeling of collapse of charged matter leads to different result for the late - time decay of the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite .",
    "thus we complement earlier results on late - time tails of neutral massive @xcite and massless fields @xcite in the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm backgrounds .",
    "in addition , when @xmath138 the continued fraction equation ( [ continued_fraction ] ) indicates presence of some new roots in the frequency domain , which do not exist for the neutral field , and whose real parts are proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "these roots exist for any value of @xmath5 and @xmath19 ( and nonzero @xmath3 ) , but correspond to higher `` overtones '' for weakly charged black hole ( fig .",
    "[ figimaginarymode ] ) , yet , they become dominant for nearly extremal black holes .",
    "these `` modes '' , if they exist , can not be extracted from a time - domain profile , probably due to the quick onset of asymptotic tails , and , therefore , must be further verified with an alternative method of calculation .",
    "the obtained here conclusion on the stability of a massive charged scalar field around kerr - newman black hole allows us to go on the study of hawking radiation for this case .",
    "using numerical techniques makes it possible to find grey - body factors accurately for the full range of parameters @xcite .",

    "<S> so far analysis of the quasinormal spectrum of a massive charged scalar field in the black hole background has been limited by the regime of small @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are mass and charge of the field ( black hole ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall present a comprehensive picture of quasinormal modes , late - time tails and stability of a massive charged scalar field around kerr - newman black holes for any physically meaningful values of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that despite presence of the two mechanisms of superradiance ( owing to black hole s rotation and charge ) and the massive term creating growing bound states , there is no indication of instability under quasinormal modes boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that for some moderate values of @xmath1 dominant quasinormal modes may have _ arbitrarily small real oscillation frequencies _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic formula for the quasinormal modes has been derived in the regime of large @xmath1 . the larger the field s charge , the sooner asymptotic tails dominate in a signal , making it difficult to extract quasinormal frequencies from a time - domain profile . </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions for intermediate and asymptotically late - time tails have been found for the reissner - nordstrm black hole . for the near extremal kerr - newman black holes we have obtained a more general picture of the _ mode branching _ found recently for massless fields ( arxiv:1212.3271 ) in the kerr background . </S>"
