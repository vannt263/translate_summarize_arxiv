    "one of the main recent developments in the study of galaxy formation and evolution has been the realization of the key role played by nuclear activity due to accretion onto super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "low - level accretion - powered activity has been suggested to be relevant for a variety of phenomena , including regulating star formation at galaxy scales via energy feedback to solve the ` downsizing ' problem and providing extra energy to solve the ` cooling flow ' problem ( cowie et al .",

    "the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting a strong connection between galaxy formation and nuclear activity are the tight empirical scaling relations connecting the mass of the central smbh with global properties of the host galaxy , such as bulge luminosity and mass ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) , galaxy - light concentration ( graham et al . 2001 ; erwin 2004 ) , and stellar velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "an issue of fundamental importance in understanding the galaxy - black hole connection is the ` duty cycle ' of nuclear activity , and its dependence upon , e.g. black hole mass . if smbhs are indeed ubiquitous in galactic bulges , little is known about the frequency and intensity of nuclear activity , the more so at the low - mass end ( see greene & ho 2007a ) .",
    "even though a minimum level of accretion should be present , fueled by mass loss during stellar evolution ( e.g. ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) , the inferred accretion - powered luminosities are often lower than what expected from standard bondi - hoyle accretion ( as found e.g. for the galactic center smbh sgr a@xmath11 ; baganoff et al .  2003 ) .    from an empirical point of view , optical studies are mostly limited to samples of known active nuclei ( e.g. woo & urry 2002 ; heckman et al . 2004 ; kollmeier et al . 2006 ; greene & ho 2007b ) with limited coverage of the black hole mass - eddington luminosity ( m@xmath12-l@xmath13 ) plane .",
    "prior to the launch of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , searches for low - level accretion powered x - ray emission from apparently inactive galaxies were effectively limited to x - ray luminosities @xmath14 erg s@xmath1 ( e.g. fabbiano & juda 1997 ; allen , di matteo & fabian 2000 ; sulkanen & bregman 2001 ) .",
    "the greatly improved _",
    "chandra  _ sensitivity , together with its fine spatial resolution , has made it possible to investigate nuclear emission associated with smbh activity down to 3 orders of magnitude deeper , effectively bridging the gap between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and inactive galaxies .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , only very low levels of nuclear x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath15/l@xmath13  @xmath16 , 2 - 10 kev ) have been observed in nearby _ massive _ ellipticals ( di matteo et al .",
    "2000 ; ho et al .",
    "2001 ; loewenstein et al .  2001",
    "; pellegrini 2005 ; soria et al .",
    "2006a , b ; santra et al .",
    "2007 ) , despite their containing vast fuel reservoirs in the form of hot x - ray emitting interstellar gas .",
    "while these results rule out radiatively efficient solutions for the accretion flow , the detected x - ray luminosities can vary by orders of magnitude when plotted against the bondi accretion rate ( pellegrini 2005 ) , with a large fraction of systems being even fainter than predicted by advection - dominated accretion flow models ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "these observations are closely related to the role of smbh feedback in inhibiting star formation at a galaxy scale level .",
    "semi - analytical models applied to state of the art cold - dark - matter simulations have recently highlighted the importance of highly sub - eddington smbh activity . in the formulation by croton",
    "( 2006 ) , a low level of prolonged activity ( the so - called ` radio mode ' ) is essential to prevent the reservoir of gas surrounding the most massive galaxies from cooling and producing young stars , and thus reproduce their red colors . in this scenario ,",
    "low - level smbh feedback halts the gas supply to the disk from the surrounding hot halo , truncating star formation and allowing the existing stellar population to redden .",
    "so far however , these studies have been sparse and necessarily focused on the small number of galaxies at the high - mass end of the local population . at the same time , while the paucity of agn in the local universe is a known phenomenon , recent studies point towards an actual decline in the spatial density of local active black holes with mass below @xmath17m@xmath9  ( greene & ho 2007b ) , possibly due to low black hole occupation fraction and/or low bulge fraction in dwarf galaxies . in turn",
    ", this can place constraints on the very mechanism by which smbhs formed in the early universe , since different models for the formation of black hole seeds predict different black hole occupation fractions at redshift zero .",
    "this effect becomes more prominent down the mass function .",
    "in particular , models where the black hole seeds are formed in the nuclei of gravitationally unstable pre - galactic discs that form through the collapse of haloes at redshift @xmath1810 ( e.g. , madau & rees 2001 , begelman et al .",
    "2006 , lodato & natarajan 2006 ) predict the existence of a population of faint low - mass galaxies with no black hole at their center ( volonteri et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .    as a matter of fact , ` light ' smbhs , presumably harbored by faint dwarf galaxies , remain elusive : the strong limits placed by dynamical studies on the masses of the nuclear objects in m33 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ; merritt et al .",
    "2001 ) and ngc205 ( valluri et al .  2005 ) suggest that neither galaxy hosts a smbh of the mass expected from extrapolation of the known scaling relations in massive bright galaxies .",
    "ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2006a ) suggest that , while smbhs are common in bright ( absolute b magnitude m@xmath19 20 ) massive galaxies , they would be progressively replaced by compact stellar nuclei moving down the mass function , and may disappear entirely at the faint end . on the other hand",
    ", compelling evidence exists for a @xmath20 m@xmath9  black hole at the center of our own milky way ( ghez et al .",
    "2005 ) , providing us with the best example of highly radiatively inefficient black hole accretion ( the measured x - ray luminosity between 210 kev can be as low as @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 ; baganoff et al .",
    "although no direct dynamical black hole mass determination exists below @xmath22 m@xmath9 , indirect evidence points towards the existence of such objects in active galaxies ( filippenko & ho 2003 ; peterson et al .",

    "[ sec : res ] , this is the optimal depth for an extensive survey : the threshold is deep enough to be interesting , yet bright enough to ensure negligible contamination by stellar mass black holes ( or background sources ) within the chandra point spread function ( psf ) .",

    "we applied a wavelet detection algorithm over each activated chip , using ciao wavdetect with sensitivity threshold corresponding to a @xmath30 chance of detecting one spurious source per psf element if the local background is uniformly distributed .",
    "we used the default wavelet parameters , with scales increasing by a factor of @xmath31 : between 14 pixels on a full resolution circular region of 512 pixel radius centered on the nominal position of the target ( restricting the circle to the sole s3 chip ) , and between 18 pixels for a 1  resolution image of each activated chip .",

    "the key notion is that the excess energy and angular momentum is lost to a wind at all radii ; the final accretion rate into the hole may be only a tiny fraction of the mass supply at large radii .",

    "the correlation implies that a substantial fraction of the energy associated with gas entering the bondi radius must be dissipated mechanically , via jets / outflows .",
