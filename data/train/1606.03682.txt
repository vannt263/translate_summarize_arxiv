    "<S> the agreement is not too surprising since the conductivity resulting from both expressions is proportional to @xmath76 , and the dependence of the electron and hole interlayer conductivity follows the dependence of the interlayer coupling shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coupling_rho](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of the interlayer coupling is determined by the periodic part of the bloch function ( the orbital composition ) , the phase or envelope @xmath77 , and the interlayer trigonal arrangement of the 3 nearest neighbor mo atoms in one layer with respect to a mo atom in the other layer . </S>",
    "<S> we will first discuss the @xmath2 valley and then the @xmath3 valley . </S>",
    "<S> first , consider the unrotated 2h bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> the very small interlayer coupling of the conduction band is due the symmetry of the conduction band bloch functions at the @xmath2 points . the conduction band edge at @xmath2 is composed of predominantly mo @xmath78 orbitals . in a minimal basis , the bloch state at the conduction band edge of an individual monolayer is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the position of each mo atom . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction band interlayer coupling is proportional to the the interlayer matrix element @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the matrix element between interlayer , nearest neighbor , mo @xmath78 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> since the interlayer matrix element @xmath82 is independent of the azimuthal angle , it is pulled outside of the sum , and the sum of the three phase factors exactly cancel . </S>",
    "<S> ( for an expanded discussion , see the supplementary information of [ ] . )    in contrast , the valence band state at @xmath2 is composed of @xmath83 and @xmath84 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer matrix elements between these orbitals change sign as a function of the azimuthal angle preventing the cancellation of the phase factors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at the @xmath2 valley of the unrotated structure , even though the conduction band orbitals are out - of - plane and the valence band orbitals are in - plane , the interlayer coupling at @xmath18 is an order of magnitude smaller than the interlayer coupling at @xmath29 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coupling_rho](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> two mechanisms compete to determine the effect of interlayer rotation on the conduction band coupling at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> when one layer is rotated with respect to the other , the symmetry is broken , and the exact cancellation of the phases is destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> this effect would cause the matrix element to increase . </S>",
    "<S> however , now the unit cell size has increased to one of the supercells shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tbl_mos2 ] , and the interlayer matrix elements between all of the @xmath78 orbitals in the supercell and their associated phase factors must be added . at @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the phase is changing sign approximately every lattice constant , so that as the wavefunction of the top layer is rotated with respect to that of the bottom layer , and the phases are summed over the large supercell , the matrix element is suppressed by phase cancellation . </S>",
    "<S> these two competing effects cause the initial slower decrease in the coupling of the conduction band at @xmath2 compared to the coupling of the valence band at @xmath2 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coupling_rho](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of misorientation on the the interlayer resistivity of the electrons at @xmath2 is similar to the effect of misorientation on the interlayer resistivity of electrons and holes in bilayer graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron resistivity increases exponentially with the size of the supercell lattice constant , although the increase in mos@xmath0 is orders of magnitude less than the increase in bilayer graphene ( compare fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d of [ ] or fig . 4 of [ ] with fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coupling_rho](b ) ) . the valence band edge at @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is composed of 28% s @xmath85 orbitals and 67% mo @xmath78 orbitals@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these out - of - plane orbitals , especially the @xmath85 orbitals on the surface s atoms , strongly couple between layers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the interlayer matrix elements are independent of the azimuthal angle , and at @xmath3 , all of the phase factors are 1 , so the matrix elements add , and the interlayer coupling is large as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coupling_rho](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> when one layer is rotated with respect to the other , no phase cancellation can occur , since the @xmath3 wavefunctions have no phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the holes at @xmath3 are minimally affected by layer rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the only effect on the hole coupling is through the slight increase in the interlayer separation causing a slight decrease in the interlayer coupling as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coupling_rho](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the interlayer coupling of the holes monotonically decreases with angle rather than with supercell size , following the monotonic increase of the interlayer distance ( see table s1 ) , which further indicates that different physics govern the effect of misorientation on the electron and hole interlayer coupling . to gain perspective into what the resistivity values mean for a device application </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the target resistivity value of 2.5 @xmath86m@xmath87 for the emitter contact resistance required to achieve thz cutoff frequency in a heterostructure bipolar transistor ( hbt ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer resistivity of the holes is approximately equal to or below that value for all angles . </S>",
    "<S> for all non - zero rotation angles considered , the interlayer resistivity of the electrons is one or more orders of magnitude too high . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests design optimization of a heterostructure bipolar transistor ( hbt ) using stacked tmds . </S>",
    "<S> a pnp hbt will be insensitive to misalignment of the layers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , rotating the emitter layer with respect to the base layer in a pnp hbt will increase the emitter injection efficiency by one or more orders of magnitude , since the transmission of electrons injected from the base will be suppressed while the transmission of holes injected from the emitter will be unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _ : the electron interlayer coupling of the conduction band at @xmath2 is weak ( 7.6 mev ) , and it decreases by a factor of 63 as the supercell lattice constant increases by a factor of 4 corresponding to a @xmath88 rotation . the hole coupling is large ( 632 mev ) and remains large decreasing by a factor of 1.3 at a rotation angle of @xmath89 the corresponding electron interlayer resistivity increases from 4 @xmath90 to @xmath91 @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the hole resistivity remains near @xmath92 @xmath90 for all rotation angles . </S>",
    "<S> interlayer rotation between an n - type and p - type region will suppress the electron current , which is desirable in the base - emitter junction of a pnp hbt .    </S>",
