    "a natural setting for the creation of localized states , both fundamental ones and those carrying intrinsic vorticity , in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is provided by ",
    "pancake \" configurations , which are strongly confined in one ( axial ) direction , @xmath2 , being weakly trapped in the transverse plane , ( @xmath3 ) . in the experiment ,  pancakes \" were created by a superposition of a tight flat optical trap , formed by a pair of strongly repulsive ( blue - detuned ) light sheets , and a loose in - plane radial magnetic trap ketterle . alternatively , the axial trap may be represented by one cell of a very strong optical lattice ( ol )  @xcite .",
    "the pancake configuration may exist with either sign of the intrinsic nonlinearity , self - repulsive or self - attractive ( although , as far as we know , in the latter case experiments were not reported , as yet , in the pancake geometry ) .",
    "in particular , the attractive sign can be induced by means of the feshbach - resonance technique , as in well - known works which demonstrated the creation of effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) solitons in the condensates of @xmath4li @xcite and @xmath5rb @xcite atoms , and in other settings ( for instance , in experiments with the condensate formed by weakly interacting @xmath6k atoms @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the sign of the nonlinearity , one may expect the establishment of different matter - wave patterns . in the case of the repulsion , a relatively weak ( in comparison with the tight axial trap ) in - plane parabolic ( alias harmonic ) confining potential gives rise to an axisymmetric ground state , that may be described by means of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "imparting the angular moment to the confined axisymmetric state creates a vortex , which may be unstable against the bending of its axis in the full 3d geometry @xcite , but is stable in the planar form . on the other hand , multiple vortices , with topological charge @xmath7 , were demonstrated experimentally @xcite and theoretically double - vort to be unstable against splitting into unitary ones .",
    "nevertheless , it was predicted that multiple vortices may be stabilized by imposing an anharmonic in - plane trapping potential @xcite .    in the case of the self - attractive nonlinearity ,",
    "a challenging problem is to predict , and create in an experiment , 2d solitons and solitary vortices ( solitons with the embedded vorticity ) that would be stable in the pancake setting , despite the possibility of the collapse . if the in - plane confinement is provided by the axisymmetric parabolic potential , soliton - like states are stable provided that their norm ( the total number of atoms ) falls below a critical value which stipulates the onset of the collapse @xcite .",
    "the critical value strongly increases for vortex solitons , but they are vulnerable , below the collapse threshold , to another instability , which tends to break them into a few fragments shaped as fundamental solitons , which may later suffer the intrinsic collapse .",
    "stability limits for the trapped vortices in the self - attractive bec have been studied in detail theoretically , both for the nearly planar and full 3d geometries @xcite-@xcite , including the limit case of the cigar - shaped ( prolate ) trap , opposite to that of the oblate ",
    "pancake \" luca , we - vortex - in - tube .",
    "in particular , it was found that such solitons with multiple charges , @xmath7 , are always unstable ; as concerns the unitary vortices ( @xmath8 ) , they feature a region of a semi - stability between fully stable and unstable configurations , where the vortex periodically splits and recombines @xcite .",
    "another general possibility to stabilize both fundamental solitons and various solitary - vortex states in the 2d geometry is offered by the use of periodic ( rather than parabolic ) in - plane potentials , that may be typically created by means of ols .",
    "for 2d periodic potentials , this possibility was first demonstrated in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "then , it was shown that a quasi-1d potential , induced by a 1d ol ( i.e. , a periodic potential that depends on a single in - plane coordinate ) can also stabilize fundamental solitons @xcite . the general case of an anisotropic potential , composed by two perpendicular sublattices with unequal strengths , was investigated recently @xcite .    a very accurate model for the description of the mean - field dynamics of dilute condensates",
    "is provided by the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "an effective 2d equation for the  pancake \" geometry should be derived from the 3d gpe by means of an adequate reduction procedure .",
    "it was developed , using the ansatz which assumes the factorization of the wave function in the axial direction and perpendicular ( pancake s ) plane , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the result is a nonpolynomial nonlinear schrdinger equation(npse ) ( it takes a different nonpolynomial form in the cigar - shaped setting , when the dimension is reduced from 3 to 1 @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the objective of the present work is to use the 2d npse for the systematic analysis of effectively 2d localized states in both cases of the self - repulsive and self - attractive nonlinearity . to this end , we briefly recapitulate the derivation of the effective 2d equation in section ii , where the respective tf approximation is considered too . in section iii",
    "we focus on the model with the repulsive nonlinearity . using the 2d  npse",
    ", we construct solution families for both the ground state and vortices trapped in the axisymmetric in - plane parabolic potential .",
    "the comparison with direct numerical solutions of the underlying 3d gpe demonstrates that the effective equation , unlike the formal 2d version of the gpe , with the cubic nonlinearity , provides for virtually exact shapes of both the ground and vortex states . in section iv",
    ", we consider the model with the self - attraction .",
    "first , we construct families of fundamental and vortical states trapped in the axisymmetric parabolic potential . in that case too , we conclude that the respective version of the 2d npse provides for a virtually exact prediction of the shape of the states .",
    "the 2d  npse  reproduces earlier known results for the stability of trapped states with vorticity @xmath9 , and generates a new stable regime for @xmath10 and @xmath1 , in the form of periodic splitting of the double or triple vortex into a pair or triplet of unitary vortices followed by their recombination back into the single double or triple vortex .",
    "then , we consider the quasi-1d periodic potential , for which families of fundamental solitons are found as numerical solutions of the 2d npse , and also by means of the variational approximation ( va ) applied directly to the underlying 3d gpe .",
