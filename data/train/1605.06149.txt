    "when in 2007 the new york times published an article suggesting that plants were quantum computers , quantum information scientists exploded into laughter @xcite .",
    "their concern was , of course , decoherence which is believed to be one of the fastest and most efficient processes in nature .",
    "the laughter is over and quantum biology is firmly established , but the mechanism which sets decoherence apart is still under debate .",
    "+ the experiments by engel et al .",
    "show that long lasting coherence in photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes is observed at physiological temperatures @xcite . quantum coherence over hundreds of femtoseconds in the initial steps of photosynthesis ,",
    "the tranfer of light quanta towards the reaction centers , in green and purple bacteria @xcite at room temperature @xcite , algae at ambient temperature of 294 k @xcite and even in living cells of purple bacterium @xcite warrant the high efficiency of the light - harvesting process .",
    "it has even been suggested that the high efficiency of photosynthesis may be associated with coherent energy and charge transfer on a long timescale @xcite .",
    "+ citing hildner et al . : ",
    "... quantum coherence is the central aspect connecting fields as diverse as quantum computing and light - harvesting  @xcite . + in 2011 the first commercially available quantum computer was presented by the company d - wave consisting of an array of more than thousand flux qubits ( june , 2015 ) , which solves optimization problems with many free parameters @xcite .",
    "it works as a quantum computer of the quantum annealing type for minutes and even for half an hour .",
    "however , a single flux qubit in a ramsey interference experiment shows coherent oscillations between the two supercurrents for time of the order of 20 ns , which is 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the coherence time of the d - wave computer @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations decays to @xmath3 after 20 - 25 ns .",
    "it is often said that the flux qubit loses coherence within 20 ns , or it dephases , or it is decohered , or it is driven by noise or experimental imperfections .",
    "the experimental observation is that the probability for the oscillatory state change decreases exponentially , achieving some non - zero final value , which does not change with time any more .",
    "+ this was a noteworthy result as a flux qubit is a macroscopic device with dimensions of the order of @xmath4  .",
    "but not less noteworthy was the experimental observation of a coherent quantum behaviour of the fenna - matthews - olson pigment - protein complex not only at low temperature but even at 277 k and the coherent behaviour of the light harvesting complex in the purple bacterium living cell in a dense , wet noisy environment @xcite .",
    "the time of coherent development of the fmo - complex is picoseconds , i.e. 4 orders of magnitude shorter than that of a single flux qubit . with the help of 2d fourier transfrom electronic spectroscopy @xcite-@xcite the amplitude of a photon echo signal as a function of the waiting time between the first two laser pulses , which excite the fmo electronically , and the third laser pulse , which stimulates the photon emission from the exciton , shows beats .",
    "the beats , the oscillations in the time development of the photon echo signal , are due to the coherent superposition of two lowest energy excitons shared by all chlorophyll molecules and indicate coherent time development of the fmo - complex during the waiting time .",
    "in contrast to the experimental observation , an exponential decay of the photon signal with time would be expected , if decoherence due to interaction with the noisy environment ( phonons ) of the fmo - complex were effective , as it is generally believed that electronic coherence decays on 10 - 100 fs timescales @xcite .",
    "+ why is the beating between exciton states observed for picoseconds instead of a fast exponentially decaying signal without oscillations , as decoherence theory suggests ?",
    "why is no decay to zero amplitude of the photon signal observed , if decoherence due to interaction with the noisy environment ( phonons ) of the fmo - complex were effective ?",
    "the expected question is : why does decoherence not take over and reduce the photon signal of the fmo complex , which is in an environment of many degrees of freedom at high temperature ?",
    "decoherence theory aims to calculate the time development of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem and thereby tries to demonstrate that the reduced density matrix very rapidly approaches a quasi - diagonal form .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements are then interpreted as probabilities of finding the subsystem in the respective state .",
    "calculations for realistic models are scarce .",
    "notable are those by joos and zeh @xcite , zurek @xcite and , applying to the present investigation , by lloyd et al .",
    "+ in contrast to expectations based on the decoherence concept , both the molecular system fmo and the macroscopic flux qubit show long time coherence .",
    "the major question is : why does decoherence in both cases play no role ?",
    "the damping of the ramsey fringes in the experiment with the single flux qubit can not be due to decoherence , because otherwise the d - wave quantum computer , with an array of 1000 flux qubits , would not be able to function as a quantum computer for minutes .",
    "+ semi - classical diffusive models based on stochastic dynamics have been extensively applied to study energy and charge transport in biological systems @xcite . within a quantum master equation approach the time development of the reduced density matrix",
    "is evaluated @xcite , the effect of the phonon environment is simulated by an additive redfield term , which is dropped for the study of the time development . with a very special selection of the phonon environment ( coloured noise )",
    "the beats of the photon amplitude are reproduced , but the finite final value of the photon amplitude is not explained .",
    "furthermore the 2d fourier transform experiment shows that no special phonons are involved in the damping of the signal , changing the fmo phonon spectrum does not influence the results @xcite . +",
    "theoretical attempts based on the electron incoherent hopping process @xcite between pigment molecules in the photosynthetic unit have been suggested @xcite . +",
    "a discussion topic is the nature of the superimposed coherent states in the protein - pigment complexes .",
    "vibrational , electronic or vibronic states may be involved , with indications from experiment favouring their vibronic character ( @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "+ we focus on the experimental observation in the 2d fourier transform electronic spectroscopy which demonstrates coherence by the fenna - matthews - olson protein - chlorophyll complex of green sulfur bacteria over times longer than 1000 fs and even at high temperature ( 277 k ) . the amplitude of the measured photon echo signal oscillates with time , which is an indication of coherent behaviour , suggested as the basis for the extreme efficiency of the photon transfer towards the reaction center and hence of the photosynthetic processes in the depth of the black sea .",
    "the expectation that decoherence due to the chaotic molecular environment , considered to be very fast , on the timescale of @xmath5 s , in the bacterium cell at physiological temperatures will destroy coherence , is not confirmed experimentally .",
    "the issues we will address in the present article refer to :    * why is decoherence not effective and not fast enough to destroy coherence ? * despite that the photon amplitude beats are exponentially damped with time , the final value is finite , larger than zero even at high temperature .",
    "what is the reason for this ? * missing isotope effect , random exchanges of @xmath1h atoms or of @xmath6 with their isotopes do not change the picture .",
    "random hydrogen exchange with deuterium and exchange of all @xmath6 with @xmath7 or even the whole hydrocarbon side chain of the pigment by a different one do not affect the coherent behaviour @xcite .",
    "this procedure certainly changes the phonon spectrum , but the results on the coherent quantum beats are not influenced .",
    "coherence is experimentally shown in bacteria @xcite , algae @xcite and green plants @xcite .",
    "the structure of their protein backbones differ and hence the protein scaffolds can not serve as the ubiquitous protection of electronic coherence , as it is suggested in refs . @xcite . *",
    "a discusion issue is the nature of the coherent states and the role of the environment .",
    "our results are in favour of vibronic states , many - particle states involving electron exciton components and local vibrations of the protein backbone .",
    "the dying out of the oscillations between the two supercurrents in the single flux qubit was explained in a coherent picture solving shrdinger s time dependent equation in high dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the decisive features of the theory are summarized in the next section together with the description of a simple model of the physical picture of the processes in fmo 2d fourier transform electronic spectroscopy .",
    "the results are presented in section [ results ] , followed by a summary and conclusions .",
    "the fmo protein complex consists of seven chlorophyll molecules in a protein cavity .",
    "there is an eighth bacteriochlorophyll molecule outside the cavity whose interaction with the rest seven molecules can be neglected .",
    "the first two laser pulses in the 2d spectroscopic experiment , delayed by only 20 fs from each other , excite two excitons and lead to their coherent superposition , which results in the beating signal .",
    "the time between the first two laser pulses , i.e. the coherence time @xmath8 , in different 2d spectroscopic experiments is of the order of 20 to 500 fs and the duration of each pulse is 15 - 40 fs .",
    "these times are very short compared to the time needed to establish the entanglement with the gravonons ( representing local version of the gravitons ) , the environmental excitations we take into account in addition to the excitations considered in other theories like phonons and electron - hole pairs .",
    "therefore for the purposes of our theory the first two laser pulses are regarded as one double pulse .",
    "the third laser pulse is applied after a waiting time varying from 0 fs to 1000 - 1500 fs and serves to stimulate the emission of the photon , which is recorded as the photon echo after the rephasing time @xmath9 .",
    "+ the physical picture we describe is the following .",
    "the exciton electron wave packet is diffuse , penetrating in the protein scaffold , where as a nuclephile in a nucleophilic - like reaction the exciton electron attacks the positively polarized carbon atom of the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment .",
    "the electron can be transiently accomodated in the @xmath11-affinity like orbital on the carbonyl carbon atom creating a transient negative ion resonance ( nir ) .",
    "thus the electron penetrates in the carbon core region where it interacts gravitationally with the atom core . at interatomic distances",
    "the strength of the gravitational interaction is enhanced by many orders of magnitude , if hidden extra dimensions exist . in the spirit of einstein s",
    "general relativity the gravitational interaction between masses deforms spacetime and we introduce a basis state called warp resonance for the electron ( fig . [ twooscillators2 ] ) , where it entangles with the gravitons ( the messenger particles of the gravitational field ) .",
    "locally a soft gravonon structure is generated , which is constructed as a correlated motion of 3 - 4 atoms leading to the warping .",
    "the soft gravonons in our theory are the solution of interacting quantum harmonic oscillators centered on the 3 - 4 atoms close to the nir . for more details on the theory concerning the generation of the gravonons",
    "see refs . @xcite .",
    "+ the electromagnetic field acts as an external force on the carbon atom and , together with the thermal fluctuations , shifts it slightly in a different position creating a local deformation in the protein chain .",
    "this is no wonder since the local vibrations of the atoms in the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment are different if the carbon atom has captured transiently the electron or not .",
    "the local deformation of the protein chain occurs around the nir , it is associated with slight increase in energy , and is described by introducing a basis state called deformation resonance for the core motion of the carbonyl fragment .",
    "furthermore excitation of vibrational modes like the rocking and wagging motion of the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment is possible which we describe by coupling the deformation resonance to two local harmonic oscillators , i.e. to local vibrational modes ( fig .",
    "[ twooscillators2 ] ) .",
    "+ in the deformation resonance coupling to the extended phonons of the protein backbone is also effective , leading to phonon excitation and energy dissipation from the local region ( fig .",
    "[ twooscillators2 ] ) .",
    "the exciton electron has the option to decay from its localized state in the nir in delocalized electron states , called escape states because total energy has to be conserved , if phonons are excited .",
    "electron states delocalized over the chlorophyll assembly with the @xmath11-affinity like orbital of the carbonyl carbon atom as component play this role .",
    "it is within the deformation resonance that coupling with the phonons of the protein backbone is taken into account and energy dissipation from the local region in the protein backbone via phonon excitation may occur .",
    "however , due to the interaction between the deformation resonance and the local rocking and wagging modes of the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment , reflection to and fro between the local states occurs . therefore , despite the dissipation into the protein backbone phonons , there remains a local non - zero electron component in the total wave packet , which explains the finite non - zero value of the photon signal in the 2d spectroscopic experiment when the deexcitation of the exciton electron is stimulated by the third laser pulse .",
    "+ the gravitational interaction of the exciton electron with the carbon atom core has to be in high spacetime dimensions ( @xmath12 ) as string theory assumes . only then gravity is strong enough at small distances and decays fast with distance ( @xmath13 power law and nearly 33 orders of magnitude higher value of the gravitational constant in @xmath12 ) .",
    "the additional 7 spacial dimensions are compactified and are hidden , so that there is no discrepancy with newton s gravitational law at distances where it was proved valid . within the warped space the time development of the entanglement of the electron with gravonons leads to the beables .",
    "+ beables are mathematically precisely defined as a set of configurations in the expansion of the wave function containing a localized matter field and excited local gravonons .",
    "loosely speaking beables are matter fields ( e.g. atoms or electrons ) in @xmath14 space , entangled with gravonons , which interact with other atoms gravitationally and generate the gravonon structure in high dimensional spacetime .",
    "therefore localized atoms , molecules or electrons in @xmath14 space entangled with gravonons in high dimensions in the form of beables exist as long as the beables and the entanglement with the gravonons exist .",
    "+ the word `` beable '' has been coined by john bell @xcite as a terminology against the word observable : `` the concept of observable lends itself to very precise mathematics when identified with self - adjoined operator. but physically , it is a rather wooly concept .",
    "it is not easy to identify precisely which physical processes are to be given the status of observations and which are to be relegated to the limbo between one observation and another . ",
    "+ we use the expression beable in the sense of john bell s _ local _ beable . according to our proposal signals in experiments in @xmath14 space",
    "can be received only via beables and hence measurements are tied to beables @xcite .",
    "expressed with john bell s words : ' ' one of the apparent non - localities of quantum mechanics is the instantaneous , over all space , collapse of the wave function on measurement. but this does not bother us if we do not grant beable status to the wave function . \" + already in 1927 it was revealed that an interference pattern shows up on a photographic plate only when the number of photons falling on the plate is very large @xcite . the history of photon detection is nicely reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the results of dempter and batho are summarized in such a way that when , during the so called collapse of the wave function , the photon is destroyed , there appears somewhere on the photographic plate an atom of elemental silver which will act as an embryo from which , by photographic development , a small seed of silver will grow .",
    "the silver embryo is much smaller than the electromagnetic wavelength and constitutes the beable in our picture .",
    "+ applied to the spectroscopic method used in the bacteria experiment inestigated here this means that the photon of the laser pulse occupies during the interference process at least the whole volume of the cavity embraced by the protein scaffold , but if the photon is measured and hence destroyed , there appears a beable ( embryo ) formed in the detection devices of the experimenters .",
    "+ the described mechanism of the so called collapse of the wave function has by now also been established for matter fields @xcite-@xcite . for an electron in an excitonic state of the chlorophyll",
    "it means that the wave function of this electron occupies during the interference process the whole volume of the chlorophyll , but when it hits the protein scaffold , which acts as a kind of screen , the electron becomes localized in a tiny volume of the size of the silver embryo , this being the carbon affinity level of the carbonyl group in the model developed here .",
    "+ before the laser pulse is sent in , the electron will be almost with certainty in such a beable .",
    "the laser pulse initiates then an interference process where the many particle wave function describing photon , electron , phonon etc . extends over the whole volume embraced by the protein scaffold",
    "this many particle wave function is not a beable , but , in john bell s terminology , rather a limbo state. as time passes on a matter field will somewhere entangle with gravonons and form a beable which destroys the photon .",
    "if beforehand the photon localizes in a beable in the detection devices of the experimenters , it will do so proportional to the light intensity in the system .",
    "the question is why does the exciton electron become localized on a single carbonyl carbon atom of a single carbonyl @xmath10 fragment in the protein backbone ?",
    "quantum particles , e.g. the exciton electron , may become localized via the entanglement with gravonons in the form of beables .",
    "however , as the gravitational interaction even in high dimensional spacetime is weak , entanglement with gravonons can be effective on the energy shell alone . in the present model the exciton electron is localized because via the entanglement to gravonons a beable is generated by the local and strongly distant dependent interaction with the gravonons . in the case of on - shell coupling even a very weak coupling with the gravonons is effective .",
    "just a few or a single carbonyl carbon atom in the protein chain provide the condition for on - shell coupling with the initial exciton electron wave packet .",
    "this is the chooser mechanism for the site of most favourable entanglement with gravonons .",
    "the chooser mechanism is responsible for the appearance of stuck particles on single sites on the detection screen in double slit experiments @xcite .",
    "+ the exciton is a diffuse object .",
    "its overlap with all carbonyl @xmath10 fragments in the protein backbone would mean that the electron might be thought to reside on all carbonyl carbon atoms in @xmath10 sites at the same time and would couple to all degrees of freedom all over the protein chain .",
    "then decay in the environmental degrees of freedom resembles decoherence and is commonly predicted to be very fast .",
    "this is , however , not the case in our theory because the chooser mechanism selects a single carbonyl carbon atom on a single @xmath10 site where the condition for degeneracy coupling with the gravonons is fulfilled , i.e. where the chooser mechanism leading to the transient localization of the electron works .",
    "the electron can go to only a single carbonyl carbon atom in a single @xmath10 site , chosen by the degeneracy coupling criterion . + beables are destroyed when the entanglement with the gravonons is changed or truncated .",
    "this occurs as a tiny burst in the time development of the beable caused for instance by the laser pulses ( fig .",
    "[ beable ] ) . in the tiny",
    "burst the quantum particles ( atoms , molecules , electrons ) are released from the entanglement with the gravonons and they burst out of the beable into @xmath14 space in a limbo state. all states where particles are not entangled to gravonons we call limbo states .",
    "+ within the beable the electron is localized in the warp resonance and can be measured . as the lifetime of the gravonons in the high hidden dimensions expires , the entanglement of the localized electron with the gravonons is truncated and the electron is released in @xmath14 space .",
    "the electron bursts out of the entanglement with the gravonons .",
    "+    to demonstrate the destruction and re - creation of the beable the hamiltonian , described in section [ totalhamilt ] , is diagonalized without the term @xmath15 . then",
    "this term is transformed to the new diagonalized basis and the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) is solved as described in section [ totalhamilt ] .",
    "the tiny burst can be seen in fig .",
    "[ beable ] .",
    "it exists for a short time before the entanglement with the gravonons is reestablished which takes @xmath16 s. within the tiny burst experimentally nothing can be recorded about the electron .",
    "this situation does exist in different experiments : in double slit diffraction experiments with electrons and molecular beams we know nothing about the quantum particles during their time of flight between the source and the detection screen ; in laser - induced desorption we know nothing about the adsorbate for the time of flight between the state with the adsorbate as a beable on the substrate surface and in the mass spectrometer , where a new beable is created .",
    "+ the effect of the double laser pulse in experiment is to induce a tiny burst in the time development since the laser pulse creates an electromagnetic field , which exerts a force on the localized particle within a beable .",
    "slight shifts of the atom positions mean changed local gravonon structure and destroyed coupling to the gravonons ( very short ranged ) , hence the beable is destroyed . for instance",
    ", the double laser pulse in the 2d spectroscopic experiment interacting with the electric dipole due to the localized electron on the carbon atom , induces a slight shift of the carbon atom and rocking and wagging motion of the carbonyl @xmath17 fragment in the protein .",
    "this would cause such a drastical change in the gravonon structure , typical for the beable configuration existing before the laser induced tiny burst , that the entanglement with the gravonons is destroyed .",
    "this is how the gravonon structure and the beable are destroyed by the laser pulses .",
    "as the entanglement with the gravonons develops in a period of time of the order of @xmath18 s , in the laser - pulse - induced tiny burst the electron is released from the entanglement with the gravonons , however , its coupling with other excitations , living in 4 dimensional spacetime like phonons and the vibrations of the local oscillators , gains weight .",
    "although experimentally an electron , a photon or a molecule released from a beable can not be directly detected during the tiny burst , we can calculate the time development further with the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "this is where in our theory we start a new time development : the electron is localized in a transient nir on a carbonyl carbon atom in a single carbonyl @xmath10 fragment , the photon is in the protein cavity , no gravonons are involved .",
    "+ during the tiny burst the exciton electron is no more entangled with the gravonons , it is released in a limbo state in @xmath14 space , therefore can not be directly accessed experimentally . but everything in the 2d spectroscopic experiment occurs during the tiny burst induced by the double laser pulse .",
    "this situation lasts untill the entanglement with gravonons can develop again , giving rise to the beables . during the lifetime of the beable",
    "the exciton electon , which initially is a delocalized electron wave packet , remains localized transiently on the carbonyl carbon atom . within this physical picture",
    "all measurable phenomena originate effectively from a very local region which then expands in @xmath14 space .",
    "the chooser mechanism for the generation of the beables and the concept of the tiny burst due to the laser pulse indicate that what is measured in experiment has to be interpreted in a local picture concerning just a single carbonyl @xmath10 fragment in the protein backbone , which couples to no more than two local harmonic oscillators and the phonon excitations in the protein backbone .",
    "if more local harmonic oscillators were excited , which is possible only in the absence of the chooser mechanism , the result would be indeed fast decoherence of the photon beating signal .",
    "this is , however , not measured in experiment .",
    "the quantum fields in the model are : ( i ) electron ; ( ii ) photon ; ( iii ) gravonons ; ( iv ) core movement field of the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment ; ( v ) phonons . the total hamiltonian , the gravonons taken into account as well , includes terms describing these fields and the many - particle interactions with the electron field : @xmath19 the hamiltonian for the electron includes single electron terms for exciton 1 within the chlorophyll assembly @xmath20 , exciton 2 in the chlorophyll assembly @xmath21 , exciton 1 in the warp resonance @xmath22 , electron in the deformation resonance @xmath23 , electron in delocalized escape states @xmath24 , the interaction of exciton 1 with the warp resonance and the interaction between the two excitons : @xmath25 the hamiltonian for the photon is : @xmath26 and for the non - perturbed gravonons : @xmath27 the hamiltonian for the core movement of the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment in the deformation resonance ( initial state and excited states ) includes also the two local oscillators , describing the wagging and rocking motion of the carbonyl group , and their interaction : @xmath28",

    "for the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation at different temperatures we explicitely need the dependence of the accessible vibrational configurations on temperature , i.e. counting of the vibrational configurations in the deformation resonance , and the temperature dependence of the accessible on - shell phonon configurations .",
    "the assumption is that the deformation resonance is as highly excited as the external temperature allows .",

    "one local oscillator is not enough to reproduce the temperature dependence of the signal , it is not able to compete with the dissipative effect of the protein phonons .",
    "if it were just one local harmonic oscillator available for relaxation ( one relaxed vibrational mode ) we would get fast decay of the photon amplitude and no temperature dependence since one oscillator provides one local vibrational configuration for all experimental temperatures . if the number of coupled local oscillators and local vibrational configurations were large , i.e. the exciton electron resides transiently on many carbonyl carbon atoms in many carbonyl @xmath10 fragments , we would get no temperature dependence of the decay of the photon amplitude either .",
    "it would immediately drop to zero as decoherence theory suggests .",
    "no chooser effect and fast decay in the protein phonons all over the protein chain would be the result .",
    "this is a situation when the local structure is lost .",
    "hence , the result would be fast exponential decay of the photon signal as anticipated by decoherence theory . however , in our model",
    ", starting from a delocalized exciton electron , with the chooser mechanism due to on - shell entanglement with gravonons , a localized electron in the form of a beable is generated .",
    "the local nature of the interactions in this many particle system prevents the excitation of many harmonic oscillators over the protein chain and the total decay of the photon signal . + with two local oscillators we get the exponential damping of the photon amplitude with time , the beating of the photon signal and the finite non - zero value of the photon signal at long time as shown in fig .",
    "[ temper-2osc ] .",
    "the temperature dependence is also in satisfactory agreement with the experimental observation .",
    "+ the dependence of the photon signal on the temperature is reflected by changes in the vibrational structure of the local oscillators and the accessibility of the protein phonon configurations .",
    "the temperature dependence of the accessible vibrational configurations due to the local oscillators and the delocalized phonon configurations in the protein is teated in the following way .",
    "figure [ phonon - counting ] illustrates how the local oscillator vibrational structure changes with temperature if we restrict the model to two local oscillators .",
    "the wagging and the rocking modes are assumed to have the same energy @xmath101 mev . this energy corresponds roughly to thermal energy @xmath83 at @xmath102 k. the energy is provided by the external heating and is available within the deformation resonance .",
    "so if the temperature in the 2d fourier transform spectroscopy experiment equals 77 k , it means that either one or the other local oscillator can be excited , i.e. there are two degenerate vibrational configurations due to the local oscillators involved in the interaction with the deformation resonance ( the first line in fig .",
    "[ phonon - counting ] ) . at @xmath79",
    "k and @xmath85 k the available thermal energy is sufficient to excite just 2 local vibrations which makes three degenerate local vibrational configurations ( the second line in fig .",
    "[ phonon - counting ] ) and so on .",
    "thus , when the temperature rises the local vibrational structure becomes more complex .",
    "as the temperature rises 2 , 3 , 4 ... local vibrational configurations , which are energetically accessible and are on the energy shell with respect to the energy of the exciton wave packet , will be involved .",
    "more and more on - shell local channels get open for the wave packet when the temperature rises .",
    "this is the decisive feature of the model , which prevents the destruction of the coherent time development by decoherence and the total decay in the protein phonons .",
    "+ because we solve schrdinger s equation with a procedure similar to ci , we see that the number of the configurations involved increases with the increasing energy , i.e. with increasing temperature .",
    "+ the channels for decay in delocalized protein phonons also increase , the avaibale density of phonon configurations on the energy shell of the initial wave packet increases linearly with temperature .",
    "this is so because we assume a one - dimensional protein chain with constant density of states which provides a linear dependence on the temperature of the on - shell density of phonon configurations .",
    "if we would take the @xmath14 debye model for the phonons the density of on - shell phonon configurations would vary with @xmath103 , which would result in fast dissipation in phonons , accompanied by the decay of the electron in the delocalized escape states .",
    "+ the higher the temperature , the more protein phonon configurations are accessible on the energy shell .",
    "assume the energy in the deformation resonance is 11 mev corresponding to a temperature of 125 k. the phonon configurations in the protein backbone which preserve the energy of the total wave packet can vary their energy upto 11 mev . assume now that the energy in the deformation resonance is 22 mev corresponding to 250k .",
    "the number of phonon configurations , which can preserve the total energy of the wave packet and thus leave it on the energy shell , is much larger .",
    "+ the two channels , governed by the terms in the hamiltonian : @xmath104 and @xmath105 compete .",
    "the first term has the effect of conserving the amplitude of the wave packet in the local region , whereas the second leads to its decay out of the local region in the delocalized protein phonons , which are not measured in the experiment , causing the exponential damping of the photon signal at short time .",
    "as time goes by the two competing effects balance each other and the photon signal gets stabilized at a finite value .",
    "+    as the local structure in the model comprises more and more configurations with rising temperature it has a counterbalancing effect on the decay due to coupling to the delocalized phonons and warrants that the weight of local configurations with the exciton electron is retained locally .",
    "then the third laser pulse in the experiment can interact with the localized electron in the @xmath11 , the deformation resonance and the local oscillators and stimulate the photon emission with the amplitude retained in the local structure . + for our result the localized initial beable state is decisive . in our theory",
    "we start from a local beable and follow its time development during the tiny burst . since the local structure expands in number of configurations with rising temperature , the wave packet does not delocalize completely and remains local .",
    "this reminds qualitatively of the quantum zeno effect , which is collapse after each interaction event with the environment .",
    "however , the time development of the total system in high dimensional space is completely coherent .",
    "the stochastic approaches try to obtain similar effects by an empirical special choice and tuning of the phonon noise such that the experimental beating signal is reproduced @xcite .",
    "as we see that with the simple model we reproduce the experimental dependence of the photon amplitude on the waiting time and the temperature , which is observed in the 2d fourier transform electronic spectroscopy , we can suggest an explanation of the questions raised in the introduction . + no isotope effect on the coherences in fmo",
    "is established experimentally . in our theory",
    "it is of no significance if @xmath106 is replaced by @xmath107 or @xmath6 is exchanged with @xmath7 . the local vibrational spectrum changes ,",
    "but we only need the spectrum on the energy shell of the wave packet .",
    "the local picture explains why if something changes 10  away from the transient negative ion resonance , for instance isotopes of hydrogen are exchanged , the change does not affect the coherent behaviour of the nir , which is observed in experiment .",
    "+ using an argument from perturbation theory , the first order coupling between two configurations scales with the inverse of their energy difference .",
    "the closer the energy of the interacting configurations , the stronger the interaction between them and the first order term will provide the major contribution .",
    "hence , the on - shell contribution to the coupling dominates . therefore the many particle configurations we take into account , are nearly on - shell with the initial wave packet since they provide the major contributions to the coupling .",
    "+ reminding the many - particle character of the field configurations in our theory we necessarily have to conclude that the nature of the states involved in the superposition , leading to the quantum beats , is vibronic , as it has been suggested by experimentalists as well .",
    "+ * why does conventional decoherence not prevail ? *",
    "the initial state in a conventional decoherence approach is the superposition of exciton states delocalized over the protein cavity .",
    "the environment are the protein phonons , the coupling of the excitons with the environment leads to phonon excitation .",
    "energy conservation requires that the excitons are deexcited in the ground electron state .",
    "no oscillations between the electron ground and exciton states can occur . with the argument used by decoherence theory , the reduced density matrix has then a single non - zero diagonal matrix element equal to 1 for the electron ground state of the excitons .",
    "+ this would happen if we would neglect the chooser mechanism , which localizes the electron in the @xmath11-affinity orbital of the carbonyl carbon atom . in an attempt to simulate the result of decoherence theory",
    "let us omit the local oscillators due to the carbonyl @xmath10 fragment , as in decoherence theory they play no role .",
    "the initial state is also changed , the electron is no more chosen in the warp resonance , it is assumed to be in the somewhat diffuser deformation resonance . if in our model we would disregard the chooser mechanism and the coupling to the local @xmath10 oscillators and allow the exciton electron to couple to phonon continua all over the protein chain the result is similar to what is expected from decoherence theory ( fig .",
    "[ engel - decoherence ] ) .",
    "the two curves in fig .",
    "[ engel - decoherence ] are evaluated with different initial states , of course .",
    "whereas for the upper curve the exciton electron in the initial wave packet is localized via the chooser mechanism in the beable , for the lower curve where no chooser mechanism is operating , the initial wave packet has the electron in the deformation resonance . ignoring the chooser mechanism leads to an exponential decay of the photon amplitude without oscillations to zero value , completely and irreversibly . everything is lost in the protein phonons ( cf .",
    "the dashed curve in the inset in fig . [ engel - decoherence ] ) , and this is not measured in the experiment .",
    "this resembles the prediction of conventional decoherence theory .",
    "in contrast , the chooser mechanism due to degeneracy entanglement with gravonons determines the transient localization of the electron wave packet in a beable and precludes its total decay in the environmental phonon continuum , which is the reason for retaining finite photon amplitude for long time , at least within the lifetime of the tiny burst .",
    "+    the curve , which reproduces the experimental result , starts with the exciton electron in a beable ( which is destroyed by the photon - induced tiny burst ) localized in the nir via the chooser mechanism due to entanglement with the gravonons .",
    "the exponentially decaying photon amplitude curve is evaluated by neglecting the chooser mechanism , the electron is in the deformation resonance , where it couples with the dissipative phonon environment all over the protein backbone . +",
    "* the role of the gravonons * , although they are not involved during the time of the tiny burst , is to create the beable via the chooser mechanism .",
    "the transient trapping of the exciton electron in the @xmath11-affinity orbital on the carbonyl carbon atom due to the entanglement with the degenerate gravonons occurs before the double laser pulse and the tiny burst .",

    "reduced density operator and matrix , being the basis for the conclusions in decoherence theory , are neither needed nor used .",

    "our understanding is based on the localization of the exciton electron due to a localization chooser mechanism using gravitation in high dimensional spacetime .",
    "released from the entanglement with the gravonons by the laser pulses , the electron can couple with local vibrations of the carbonyl @xmath10 group and the delocalized phonons in the protein backbone .",
    "this determines the vibronic character of the many - particle configurations leading to the beating of the photon echo signal .",
    "the two channels lead to preservation of a local non - vanishing weight of the exciton electron and to the beating photon echo signal and its exponential damping .",

    "<S> these good vibrations are claimed to have developed in three billion years of natural selection . </S>",
    "<S> these theories , however , face the discomforting experimental observation that `` attempts to scramble vibrational modes or to shift resonances with isotopic substitution miserably failed to affect the beating signals '' @xcite . as a possible way out of this dilemma we adopted the formalism of the quantum computation to the quantum beats in the fmo protein complex . </S>",
