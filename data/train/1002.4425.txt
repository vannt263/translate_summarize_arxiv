    "tropical cyclones , commonly known as hurricanes in the north atlantic ocean and typhoons in the western north pacific ocean , are one of the most devastating weather phenomena in the world .",
    "the intense winds associated with tropical cyclone often generate ocean waves and heavy rain , which usually result in severe disasters . to reduce the harm caused by the tropical cyclones ,",
    "the most important issue is the prediction of its moving trajectory .    for a long time , the phenomenon of formation of a huge intense atmospheric vortex attracted attentions of scientists working in various fields ( e.g. see @xcite and references in @xcite ) . a large progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the physical process and the quality of operational prediction of tropical cyclones ( @xcite,@xcite , and references therein ) . in particular , statistical and numerical weather prediction models have been improved dramatically and used to provide operational forecasters the high - quality prediction for national weather bureaus .",
    "the system of equations served for the numerical prediction is very complicated .",
    "it needs to take many factors into account , for examples , phase transitions , vertical advection , and boundary layer effects , etc .",
    "generally , it is difficult to use such system to comprehend its underlying physical processes . to have a conceptual understanding about these processes , some assumptions must be made to simplify the equations .",
    "the solutions then may appear in a simpler form so that it becomes much easier to gain their physical interpretations .",
    "however , neglecting some terms in the equations may risk losing some important properties of the system , e.g. the symmetries",
    ". therefore , it is very important to find particular solutions for the untruncated system of equations and to adjust them to track some particular phenomena . in the present paper",
    ", we seek special solutions for the primitive air - motion system .",
    "as we should show later , these solutions can be considered as a model of the typhoon when it is near its center .",
    "+ our model is bidimensional and we does not consider the effect of heating that results from a coupling between the latent heat released in the clouds and the vertical wind shear .",
    "it is known that a great variety of the vortex phenomenon can be explained in the frame of two - dimensional models if we consider the vertical dimension as a small scale comparing with the horizontal ones ( e.g. @xcite ) . in meteorology , this concept is often adopted in studying the processes for middle and large scales @xcite . in this case , the atmosphere is regarded to be `` thin '' . for example , the meteorologists often consider the atmosphere as a one - layer fluid in the barotropic framework without specifying the vertical coordinate . this bidimensional theory , despite such simplicity , can use to explain many observed features of the tropical cyclone motions @xcite .",
    "however , the essence of bidimensionality in our model differs from above .",
    "we derived it from a primitive complete three - dimensional system of equations by averaging the system over the height , so the vertical processes of the system are presented in a hidden form .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we study the derivation of a bidimensional model of the atmosphere dynamics based on the primitive navier - stokes equations for compressible viscous heat - conductive gas in the physical 3d space . in section 3",
    ", we investigate polynomial solutions for both barotropic and baroclinic system and find that the equations which govern the trajectories at the equilibrium point are the same in both cases . in section 4 , we test possible trajectories of the typhoon center with various input parameters and demonstrate that our the artificial trajectories can imitate the behavior of the typhoon eye tracks .",
    "moreover , numerical simulation shows that the motion of the vortex center provided by our explicit algebraic formulas is reasonably close to the motion of a developed vortex when it is near the equilibrium . in section 5",
    ", we examine two different types of historical typhoons : man yi ( parabolic trajectory ) and parma ( loop ) , with our theoretical results . here , we propose a method of the parameter - fitting that allows us to predict the trajectory of typhoon eye only based on three successive points in the past . in section 6 , we further investigate the situation when the typhoon encounters the shore . in this case , the typhoon may disappear due to the destruction of the stable vortex . finally , discussions about our topics and future work are provided in section 7 .",
    "the motion of compressible rotating , viscous , heat - conductive , newtonian polytropic gas in @xmath4 is governed by the compressible navier - stokes equations @xcite",

    "@xmath9 is the angular velocity of the earth rotation , @xmath10 is the vector of heat conduction .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath11 is given by the newton law @xmath12 where the constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coefficient of viscosity , and the second coefficient of viscosity . here",

    "the state equations are @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a constant , @xmath20 is the universal gas constant , @xmath21 is the specific entropy , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the specific heat ratio .",
    "the state equations ( 2.5 ) imply @xmath24 which allows us to consider ( 2.1 )  ( 2.3 ) as a system of equations for the unknowns @xmath25 indeed , from ( 2.1 )  ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.6 ) , we arrive @xmath26 for simplicity , we denote the system ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) , ( 2.7 ) as ( ns ) .",
    "let @xmath27 be a point on the earth surface , @xmath28 be the latitude of some fixed point @xmath29 following from @xcite ( early this approach was used in @xcite for barotropic atmosphere ) , we derive a spatially two - dimensional system for ( ns ) .",
    "let us introduce @xmath30 and @xmath31 to represent for taking the average of @xmath32 and @xmath33 over the height respectively , namely , @xmath34 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary functions , and denote @xmath35 moreover , the usual adiabatic exponent , @xmath36 is related to the  two - dimensional \" adiabatic exponent @xmath37 as follows : @xmath38    now , we include the impenetrability conditions in our model .",
    "these conditions ensure that the derivatives of the velocity equal to zero on the earth surface and a sufficiently rapid decay for all thermodynamic quantities as the vertical coordinate @xmath39 approaches to infinity . in other words ,",
    "the impenetrability conditions make sure the boundedness of the mass , energy , and momentum in the air column .",
    "they also provide the necessary conditions for the convergence of integrals .",
    "let us denote additionally @xmath40 ( the coriolis parameter ) and @xmath41    in this way , one can get the system as the @xmath0- plane approximation near @xmath42 : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath13 and @xmath48 are the coefficients of viscosity interpreted as the coefficients of turbulent viscosity ( may be not only constants ) .",
    "their values are much greater than those for the molecular analogues . for simplicity",
    ", the coefficients of the heat conductivity are assumed to be constants and equal .",
    "@xmath49 is the heat flow from the ocean surface , it is also assumed to be a constant .",
    "suppose that the velocity vector near the origin has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 this assumption is made according to the observational data @xcite(see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as it is shown in @xcite , in the stable vortex , the velocity field necessarily satisfies the cauchy - riemann conditions , namely , @xmath52 this property holds for ( [ 3.1 ] ) and also verifies our choice for the velocity field .     on different stage of the typhoon formation ( august 30 , august 31 , september 2 ) .",
    "the hurricane anita , north atlantic , 1977 @xcite ]    note that if we do not take into account the turbulent viscosity ( @xmath53 ) and the heat transfer ( @xmath54 ) in our model .",
    "we get the system similar to the gas dynamics instead of ( 2.1)- ( 2.3 ) .",
    "solutions to such system were constructed and also studied in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we next consider two forms of the system @xmath55 which have exact polynomial solutions .",
    "we assume @xmath56 and introduce a new variable @xmath57 we also consider the 2d entropy @xmath58 connecting with @xmath59 and @xmath60 through the state equation ( 2.5 ) , where we use @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 for the new unknown variables @xmath63 we arrive the system @xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    following @xcite , we change the coordinate system so that the origin of the new system is located at the center of the typhoon eye . now",
    "@xmath67 where @xmath68 is the velocity of the typhoon eye propagation .",
    "thus , we obtain a new system @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    note that in @xcite , shallow water equations were considered .",
    "it is a particular case of ( 2.8 ) with @xmath72    given the vector @xmath73 , the trajectory can be found by integrating the system @xmath74    we assume the velocity has a linear profile ( [ 3.1 ] ) and look for other components of the solution to the system ( [ 2.1])([2.3 ] ) in the following form @xmath75 @xmath76 here , @xmath77 recall that @xmath78 is the value of  renormalized \" pressure @xmath79 at the center of vortex , therefore , in the physical sense , @xmath80 substituting ( [ 3.1])([3.21 ] ) into ( [ 2.1])([2.3 ] ) and match the coefficients for similar term , we obtain @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 at the center of typhoon , there exists a domain of lower pressure .",
    "therefore , it is natural to set @xmath84    note that the motion near the typhoon center is  barotropic \" in our solution , i.e. , the pressure only depends on its density .",

    "this assumption may not hold for three - dimensional cases .",

    "the only stable equilibrium on the phase plane @xmath139 for @xmath140 is a center @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a root of the equation @xmath143 it is important that the viscosity , the heat conduction and heat inflow terms show only in the equation ( [ 3.7b ] ) , therefore , their values only affect the function @xmath144 .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of trajectory defined by the equations ( [ 3.4b ] ) - ( [ 3.6b ] ) , ( [ 3.8a ] ) - ( [ 3.11a ] ) does not depend on @xmath145",

    "( here , the radius of typhoon is taken as 300 @xmath166 the difference between the pressure at the center of typhoon and the ambient pressure is @xmath167 the constant @xmath168 is estimated as @xmath169 ) .",
    "therefore , basically , there is no reason to get the solution curves by applying numerical integration for ( [ 3.41 ]  [ 3.11 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) instead of using explicit formulas ( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) .",
    "assume initial conditions are known , one can integrate the system ( [ 3.41]) ( [ 3.11 ] ) , ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "but these initial conditions include the _ height - averaged _ physical quantities such as divergency @xmath170 vorticity @xmath171 parameters @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 ( relating to the pressure field ) , and the initial velocity @xmath175 it is not clear how to measure these quantities .",
    "the only widely available information is positions of the typhoon eye .",
    "thus , we try to fit the parameters using the formulas ( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) .",
    "however , it needs to assume that the vortex is at its conservative phase .",
    "we use the following algorithm : at the first step , we choose three successive points of trajectory ( @xmath176 ) . formulas ( 4.1 ) , ( 4.2 ) give a system of four linear algebraic equations with respect to @xmath177 the parameter @xmath3 is free .",

    "let us estimate all possible values of parameter @xmath3 at the equilibrium point . as it follows from ( [ 3.51 ] ) , @xmath3 is a root of the quadratic equation @xmath184 therefore , @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "if we further assume @xmath187 @xmath188 thus , to be physically meaningful , we can assume @xmath189 and bear in mind that this value is essentially negative .",
    "thus , if the set of three points is not able provide an appropriate value of @xmath180 the prediction is considered as a failure .",
    "we need to shift these three points until we get a definite value of @xmath3 that can be used for the weather forecast .",

    "let us consider a recent typhoon of the west pacific region , man yi ( 4 category , july 8 - 15 , 2007 ) .",

    ", we found that it is possible to fit @xmath3 so that there is a good coincidence with the artificial trajectory given by formulas ( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) in three different regions ( fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "here and below graphs , the diamond shape points represent the observational path of tropical typhoon and solid lines represent the analytic results ; the first three points of trajectories , where the points and line coincide , are used for the parameters estimation .",

    "fig.[fig8 ] shows the prediction for point 1 to 9 ( 18 hours ) , fig.[fig9 ] - for point 1 to 14 ( 48 hours ) . here",

    "the vortex is developing , thus we can not consider it as a stable one .",
    "generally , making predictions according formulas ( 4.1 ) , ( 4.2 ) may not give good results for unstable regions .",
    "nevertheless , these formulas with @xmath196 still gives a satisfactory coincidence for the real and artificial trajectories .",
    "the third region that we analyze is from point 22 to 34 , which lasts for 72 hours . in this case , the typhoon is developing from 3th to 4th stage and then decays .",
    "we get @xmath197 and obtain a very good coincidence for the 3 day period .                      now",
    ", suppose that that we do not know the track of the whole trajectory in advance and try to find @xmath3 to compare its value found from ( [ b_01 ] ) and ( [ b_02 ] ) .",
    "it is worth to note that one may propose other methods to find the averaged vorticity .",
    "this will be a subject of our further investigations .",
    "let us mention that one can consider the neural network approaches for this direction@xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath198 we get only two appropriate three point sets : one of them begins from the 21th point and gives a very good prediction ( fig.[fig11 ] ) , here @xmath199 ) .",
    "the other one predicts a loop beginning from the point 7 ( see fig.[fig12 ] ) .",
    "thus , one can assume that at the 9th point , the vortex had gone through an exterior force .",
    "it constrains the trajectory to change the direction of its path .",
    "if we weaken the requirement for accuracy and set @xmath200 we get one more three point set , beginning from point 24 . in the latter case , the artificial trajectory gives a true direction .",
    "but comparing with the exact track , the artificial trajectory outgoing from the 21th point ( fig.[fig13 ] ) is bad .",
    "however , the spread of positions is inside of the annual mean diameter of the 33 percent strike probability region for 36 hours @xcite .    : two best predictions ]    : two best predictions ]      now we consider the example of typhoon with a looping trajectory , parma , 20 - 31 october , 2003 , fig.[fig14 ] , fig.[fig15 ] .",

    "[ fig17 ] presents a forecast for a long period ( 144 h. ) based on the data for 12 hours .",
    "we can see that the forecast gives the true qualitative behavior of the trajectory , the loop .",
    "this loop was deformed by a steering flow",
    ".            0.7 cm",
    "it is well known that the typhoons basically do not last for a long time over a dry land .",
    "the key point is the significant increasing of the dry friction when the typhoon goes to the land .",
    "now , let us add the damping term @xmath202 in the right hand side of first equation ( 2.8 ) , where @xmath203 is a nonnegative function of coordinates . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath203 is a constant . therefore instead of ( [ 3.51]),([3.61 ] ) , we get @xmath204 @xmath205 equations ( [ 3.41]),([3.7 ] )  ( [ 3.11 ] ) do not change .    system ( [ 3.41 ] ) , ( [ 3.18 ] ) , ( [ 3.19 ] ) is closed .",

    "18 presents the phase portrait of the system ( [ 3.41 ] ) , ( [ 3.18 ] ) , and ( [ 3.19 ] ) for @xmath213 in this case , a stable equilibrium exists on the phase plane .",
    "19 shows the collapse of vortex for @xmath214 the vortex strehgth slightly intensifies , whereas the motion becomes significantly convergent eventually . here ,",
    "initial data are the same as in fig.18 , @xmath215     computations are made for 3 days . ]",
    "computations are made for 3 days . ]",
    "0.7 cm    thus , if we wish to obtain a stable vortex along with the surface friction , we have to consider some additional phenomenon such as vertical advection ( see @xcite ) in this context ) .",
    "note that the system ( [ 3.41 ] ) , ( [ 3.18 ] ) , ( [ 3.19 ] ) is very interesting from the mathematical point of view .",
    "it has a complex equilibrium at the origin and there is a possibility of existence of a strange attractor for certain values of parameters .",
    "in this paper , we show that the behavior of the developed tropical cyclone trajectory is determinated by exterior and inner parameters ; the trajectory is a superposition of two circular motions : one has period @xmath1 the other one has period @xmath157    our previous conclusion that the trajectories for both barotropic and baroclinic models are governed by the same system of coefficient - equations seems conflict with the fact that baroclinicity has a strong relation with the cyclone formation . about this point",
    ", we would like to clarify that the cyclone formation in our paper only refers to the conservative ( or near conservative ) phase of the atmosphere vortex development .",
    "indeed , the evidence about the velocity in a linear form ( [ 3.1 ] ) can be confirmed by the observational data which is collected as the developed typhoon is close to its center . as it shows in ( fig.1 ) , at the stage of the vortex formation , the velocity may not to be linear .",
    "therefore , we claim that we find a  toy \" solution for a very complicated system to describe the processes of formation and decay of cyclones for which an analytical solution is barely to be obtained .",
    "it worth to remark again that the term  barotropicity \" in our paper is only restricted to describe the bidimensional framework .",
    "i.e. the term  barotropicity \" is used with a hidden meaning of  taking an average over the height \" . in the physical 3d space , the flow does not have to be barotropic .",
    "+ our arguments can be verified from other researchers , for examples , in @xcite , it says  the curvature of storm track is determined by a set of ` controlling parameters ' related to the storm characteristics and ambient atmospheric circulation .",
    "these controlling parameters include the speed of storm ( @xmath216 in our notation ) , storm intensity ( @xmath217 ) , size ( @xmath218 ) , the coriolis parameter ( @xmath0 ) , ambient atmospheric pressure field ( @xmath219 ) and surface friction ( @xmath203 ) \" .",
    "also in @xcite , it says that  in a barotropic framework , a tropical cyclone is basically  steered `` by the surrounding flow ( @xmath220 ) , but its movement is modified by the coriolis force and the horizontal vorticity gradient of the surrounding flow . ''",
    "+ certainly , it would be naive to claim that our model provides a better weather forecast for the typhoon trajectory than those modern models using numerical simulations .",
    "firstly , the formula is derived under the assumption that the vortex is at stable phase , but , this assumption hardy holds for the real weather forecast .",
    "therefore , we only can deal with oscillations near the equilibrium point at most in our model . secondly ,",
    "the only variables that we feed in the equations of thermodynamic parameters are initial data from real cases .",
    "however , as the vortex moves , it may experience a forcing of baric fields , which may skew its trajectory significantly .",
    "thus , generally , we can only expect to get the reproduction of the trajectories qualitatively , i.e. , to predict a turning of the track without indicating the exact position of the vortex .",
    "finally , we do not take into consideration the curvilinear geometry of the earth surface .",
    "therefore , only in a vicinity of an initial point , the linearization does not result in a big distortion .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath221 - effect does not give an exact solution with respect to the stable vortex ( for approximative solutions , see @xcite ) .",
    "+ however , as in @xcite , even high - quality weather forecast models may not be reliable due to its uncertainty about the initial conditions or for some other unknown reasons .",
    "thus , operational weather forecasters still need to judge whether or not the prediction results should be taken into consideration to build an official weather forecast in their daily work .",
    "therefore , it is helpful to have a complimentary tool to aid other existing models for the typhoon trajectory prediction .",
    "our model seems very simple comparing with models used for the numerical weather forecast .",
    "however , it is very useful since it can be used to explain the trajectory behavior , predict the direction of the trajectory and the loop formation as well .",
    "+ our models can be further refined in two aspects : doing analytical refinement of the model and searching a better way for parameters - fitting .",
    "we conjecture that it is possible to obtain some solutions with analytical format for the navier - stokes system in spherical coordinates .",
    "then we could include the @xmath221 - drift in our model and release the requirement that the solutions need to be bound around the neighborhood of the center of typhoon .",
    "the natural question arising in the parameters - fitting method is : can we actually use the average vorticity @xmath3 as a measurement of predictability in the model ? as it is mentioned in the previous sections , even feeding with the real data for the average vorticity @xmath180 one can only get approximate predication for the trajectory behavior .",
    "the quality of the predication strongly depends on the ambient meteorological fields , which are responsible for the steering effect .",
    "in particular , theregularity \" of the ambient meteorological fields seems to be a very crucial factor for the trajectory tracing .",
    "however , it can not be obtained only through analyzing the equations of trajectories .",
    "thus , to improve the predictability and accuracy for our model , we need to combine our method with the analysis of available meteorological data and include other theorems like statistical moments ( see in this context @xcite ) and neural networks @xcite , @xcite in our model .",

    "<S> we propose a model based on the primitive system of the navier - stokes equations in a bidimensional framework as the @xmath0 - plane approximation , which allows us to explain the variety of tracks of tropical cyclones ( typhoons ) . </S>",
    "<S> our idea is to construct special analytical solutions with a linear velocity profile for the navier - stokes systems . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence of the structure of linear velocity near the center of vortex can be proven by the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> we study solutions with the linear - velocity property for both barotropic and baroclinic cases and show that they follow the same equations in describing the trajectories of the typhoon eye at the equilibrium state ( that relates to the conservative phase of the typhoon dynamics ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at the equilibrium state , the trajectories can be viewed as a superposition of two circular motions : one has period @xmath1 the other one has period @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the coriolis parameter and @xmath3 is the height - averaged vorticity at the center of cyclone .    also , we compare our theoretical trajectories based on initial conditions from the flow with tracks obtained from the observational database . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to mention that under certain conditions our results are still compatible with observational data although we did not truly consider the influence of steering effect . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose the parameter - adopting method so that one could correct the weather prediction in real time . </S>",
