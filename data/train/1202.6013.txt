    "it is shown in previous studies that the use of neural network and likelihood methods can perform the signal background separation with better efficiency  @xcite .",

    "six fermion backgrounds are not included but reference  @xcite shows that the loss of precision on @xmath64 measurement is negligible due to this background .",
