    "one of the main goals of computational cosmology is to draw a complete , self - consistent picture of galaxy formation from first principles . given the matter fluctuations in the initial conditions that are motivated by the inflationary theories , we can simulate the evolution of structure and the formation of galaxies using the laws of gravity and hydrodynamics under the cosmological model that is suggested by the observations such as the wmap ( spergel et al .",

    "it is encouraging that we obtain good agreement with observations for the lfs at @xmath5 throughout , as well as with the rest - frame uv colors ( night et al .",
    "this suggests that the simulated lbgs have realistic star formation rates and histories compared to those of the actual lbgs .",
    "a notable feature of simulated lfs is that the faint - end slope is quite steep with @xmath27 in the rest - frame magnitude range @xmath28 .",

    "both hydro simulations ( nagamine et al . 2001 , 2004b ) and the model by hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) suggest that the peak of the sfr density is at @xmath30 , which is quite different from the predictions of some of the semi - analytic models ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; somerville et al .",
    "2001 ; menci et al .",
    "together with the steep faint - end slope of the lf , our results suggest that there would be enough ionizing photons to reionize the universe at @xmath1 with the pop ii stars in standard galaxies ( nagamine et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dm ] shows the projected dark matter density field at @xmath1 ( left ) and 3 ( right ) .",
    "the left panel shows that the large - scale structure is already roughly in place by @xmath1 with large voids .",
    "each panel has a size of comoving 143 mpc on a side , corresponding to 1  degree at @xmath1 .",
    "the filaments become tighter and high density peaks become more prominent by @xmath0 . in our simulations ,",
    "lbgs and laes are centered on high density peaks that appear bright in this figure .",
    "the figure shows that a large survey area ( @xmath31 1 degree ) is needed in order to obtain a representative sample of lbgs or laes at @xmath1 .",
    "if a ( 10 arcmin)@xmath32 field - of - view of a survey was ( unluckily ) placed on a void as shown in this picture , the number density of the source would be significantly underestimated relative to the cosmic mean due to a strong cosmic variance effect .",
    "we estimate the ly@xmath3 luminosity of each galaxy in the simulation from the instantaneous star formation rate using the relation @xmath33 erg s@xmath34 per 1@xmath35 yr@xmath34 ( e.g. leitherer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this conversion factor could be higher if the imf is top heavy . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cum ] , we show the cumulative luminosity function of laes at @xmath1 estimated from the simulations as we described above .",
    "we find that the simulations overpredict the lf by a factor of @xmath36 compared to the observational estimate by ouchi et al .",
    "( 2005b , in preparation ) for the @xmath37 lae sample presented in ouchi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "since their field - of - view was @xmath31 1.5 degrees , the sample is large enough that it should nt be severely affected by the cosmic variance , and their result also agrees with that of malhotra & rhoads ( 2004 ) within the error bars .",
    "furlanetto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have also found the same overestimate of lae lf in simulations at lower redshifts .",
    "there are at least two possible ways to reconcile the overprediction of the simulated lf relative to the observed one : ( 1 ) all the laes are attenuated by a factor of @xmath38 ( hereafter ` uniform dimming ' scenario ) , or ( 2 ) one out of ten laes randomly ` turns on ' at a given time ( hereafter ` random sampling ' scenario ) . in the latter case , the reason for the randomness would be primarily due to the random geometry of the gas clouds around star - forming regions which block the ly@xmath3 photons traveling towards us , and not due to the fluctuation of star formation activity .",
    "the fluctuating sfr is already reflected in the distribution of the ly@xmath3 luminosity , and the simulation box is large enough to smooth out such fluctuations when averaged over the entire simulation volume . for these reasons , here we take the 1:10 ratio at face value as a random sampling of the sources and see what we can learn from this simple exercise . in the real universe ,",
    "a combination of the above two effects may be at play .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cum ] shows the ` uniform dimming ' scenario where all laes are uniformly dimmed by a factor of 10 .",
    "this uniform dimming can be regarded as a _ net _ result of 3 different physical processes : first is the fact that a fraction @xmath39 of all ionizing photons escape from the galaxy and do not contribute to the creation of ly@xmath3 photons .",
    "second is the dust attenuation by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "third is that only a fraction @xmath41 of ly@xmath3 photons penetrates the igm and reaches us ( e.g. barton et al . 2004 ) , although this effect is only significant before reionization ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this can be summarized as follows : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 characterizes the _ net _ escape fraction of ly@xmath3 photons from laes .",
    "our simulations suggest @xmath45 for a conversion factor of @xmath33 erg s@xmath34 per 1@xmath35 yr@xmath34 .",
    "if the imf is top heavy and the true value of the conversion factor is larger than the above , then the value of @xmath44 will become proportionally smaller .",
    "there is a possibility of distinguishing the two scenarios discussed in the previous section by looking at the correlation strength of the spatial distribution of laes . in the ` uniform",
    "dimming ' scenario , the sources basically correspond to the brightest galaxies in the most massive halos , therefore they are as strongly clustered as the bright lbgs . in the ` random sampling ' scenario , there are two effects that would weaken the clustering strength compared to the ` uniform dimming ' scenario : 1 ) the number of more massive halos that dominate the correlation signal is smaller in the randomly selected sample than the parent sample , because the number of lower luminosity laes that are hosted by lower mass halos is larger , and 2 ) poisson noise is introduced by the random sampling .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : xi ] , where the spatial correlation function was computed in the two different scenarios for samples with different ly@xmath3 luminosity limit . in all cases ,",
    "the ` uniform dimming ' scenario ( solid circles and the _ short - dashed _ line for the power - law fit ) has a longer correlation length @xmath46 than the ` random sampling ' case ( open triangles and the _ long - dashed _ line ) .",
    "there does not seem to be a clear trend for the slope of the correlation function .",
    "our predictions for the correlation lengths can be directly compared with observational data , and the above two scenarios can be tested in the near future .",
    "the main conclusions of my talk are the following :    1 .",
    "luminosity functions of simulated galaxies in cosmological hydro simulations agree well with those of the observed lbgs at @xmath5 at the bright - end ( night et al .",
    "2005 ) . at @xmath1",
    ", they have a steep faint - end slope of @xmath47 in the rest - frame magnitude range @xmath48 .",
    "this magnitude range is even beyond the current magnitude limit of rest - frame @xmath29 .",
    "cosmological hydro simulations predict that the cosmic star formation rate density peaks at @xmath30 , unlike most of the semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( nagamine et al .",
    "the above two facts suggest that there would be enough ionizing photons to reionize the universe at @xmath1 from the pop ii stars in ordinary galaxies .",
    "the simulations overpredict the lae lf by a factor of @xmath38 , and two different scenarios ( ` uniform dimming ' and ` random sampling ' ) can be considered to reconcile this result with the observed lf .",
    "the ` uniform dimming ' scenario has a stronger spatial correlation strength for laes than the ` random sampling ' scenario , and this can be tested by direct comparison to the observed data .    in the ` uniform",
    "dimming ' scenario , the lae sample for a given ly@xmath3 luminosity cut would directly correspond to a sample of bright lbgs that are already observed by the 8 meter class telescopes and the hubble space telescope . therefore the ` uniform dimming ' scenario suggests a strong link between the lae and lbg sample , which can also be tested by comparing the spatial correlation function of the two samples at the same redshift .",
    "this observational test can be readily performed with the existing subaru telescope data ( ouchi et al . 2004 , 2005 ) . in the real universe ,",
    "it is certainly possible that both effects of ` uniform dimming ' and ` random sampling ' may be at play .",
    "we also plan to perform direct comparisons of the simulated and the observed angular correlation functions of both laes and lbgs in a similar spirit to the work by hamana et al .",
    "the physical link between laes and lbgs can also be tested by a cross - correlation study of the two population ."
