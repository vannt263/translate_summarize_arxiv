    "alice  @xcite is the dedicated heavy - ion experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the main physics goal of the experiment is the study of strongly - interacting matter in the conditions of high energy density ( @xmath0 ) and high temperature ( @xmath1 ) , expected to be reached in central collisions at @xmath2 . under these conditions , according to lattice qcd calculations , quark confinement into colourless hadrons should be removed and a deconfined quark ",
    "gluon plasma should be formed  @xcite .",
    "as we will detail in the next section , heavy - flavour particles are regarded as effective probes of the system conditions . in particular :    open charm and beauty hadrons would be sensitive to the energy density , through the mechanism of in - medium energy loss of heavy quarks ;    quarkonium states would be sensitive to the initial temperature of the system through their dissociation due to colour screening .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the expected yields for heavy - quark production in pp collisions at @xmath4 are reported in the first line of table  [ tab : xsec ]  @xcite , as obtained from the next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculation implemented in the mnr program  @xcite with _ reasonable _ parameter values ( quark masses and perturbative scales )  @xcite .",
    "these yields have large uncertainties , of about a factor 2 , estimated by varying the parameters  @xcite . in the table",
    "we report also the @xmath5 and @xmath6 yields in central collisions at @xmath2 , obtained including in the calculation the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions ( eks98 parametrization  @xcite ) and applying a scaling of the hard yields with the mean number @xmath7 of binary nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions in the collision .",
    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have shown that the nuclear modification factor of particles @xmath8 distributions , , is a sensitive observable for the study of the interaction of the hard partons with the medium produced in nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "heavy quark medium - induced quenching is one of the most captivating topics to be addressed in collisions at the lhc . due to the qcd nature of parton energy loss , quarks",
    "are predicted to lose less energy than gluons ( that have a higher colour charge ) and , in addition , the ` dead - cone effect ' is expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks with respect to light partons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should observe a pattern of gradually decreasing @xmath9 suppression when going from the mostly gluon - originated light - flavour hadrons ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) to d and to b mesons  @xcite : @xmath12 .",
    "the enhancement , with respect to unity , of _ heavy - to - light @xmath9 ratios _ has been suggested  @xcite as a sensitive observable to test the colour - charge ( @xmath13 ) and mass ( @xmath14 ) dependence of parton energy loss . in addition , the smaller predicted energy loss of b quarks may allow to overcome the main limitation of light partons as probes of the medium , namely their low sensitivity to the density of the medium . according to the theoretical models  @xcite based on the bdmps framework  @xcite ,",
    "this so - called ` fragility ' became apparent already in collisions at rhic , and would be more pronounced in collisions at the lhc , where hard gluons would either be absorbed in the medium or escape the medium without really probing its density .",
    "beauty quarks could instead provide stringent constraints on the energy density of the medium .",
    "the measurement of d and b meson production cross sections will also serve as a baseline for the study of medium effects on quarkonia .",
    "two of the most interesting items in the quarkonia sector at the lhc will be : ( a ) understanding the interplay between colour - screening - induced suppression and statistical regeneration for j/@xmath15 production in a medium containing on the order of 100 @xmath5 pairs ( see table  [ tab : xsec ] ) ; ( b ) measuring for the first time medium effects on the bottomonia resonances , expected to be available with sufficient yields at the lhc . on this point ,",
    "the predicted suppression pattern as a function of the plasma temperature is particularly interesting : the @xmath16 would melt at @xmath17 , a temperature that would be reached only at the lhc , while the @xmath18 would melt at the same temperature as the j/@xmath15 , @xmath19 .",
    "it will thus be important for the experiments to be able to measure also the @xmath18 , because , at variance with the j/@xmath15 , it is expected to have a small regeneration probability and it would be very useful to disentangle j/@xmath15 suppression and regeneration . in summary , measuring the in - medium dissociation probability of the different quarkonium states at the lhc will provide an estimate of the initial medium temperature .",
    "we note that , in order to study the medium effects on charmonia , it will be mandatory to measure the fraction of secondary charmonia from b decays , expected to be about 20% for the j/@xmath15 , in absence of medium - induced effects .",
    "the desing of the alice apparatus  @xcite will allow the detection of open heavy - flavour hadrons and quarkonia in the high - multiplicity environment of central collisions at lhc energy , where up to few thousand charged particles might be produced per unit of rapidity .",
    "the heavy - flavour capability of the alice detector is provided by :    tracking system ; the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the transition radiation detector ( trd ) , embedded in a magnetic field of @xmath20  t , allow track reconstruction in the pseudorapidity range @xmath21 with a momentum resolution better than 2% for @xmath22 and a transverse impact parameter , is defined as the distance of closest approach of the track to the interaction vertex , in the plane transverse to the beam direction . ]",

    "simulation studies  @xcite have shown that alice has good potential to carry out a rich heavy - flavour physics programme .",

    "we report the results corresponding to the expected statistics collected by alice per lhc year : @xmath39 central ( 05% @xmath40 ) events at @xmath41 and @xmath42 pp events at @xmath43 , in the barrel detectors ; the forward muon arm will collect about 40 times larger samples ( i.e. @xmath44 central events ) .",

    "is based on the selection of displaced - vertex topologies , i.e. separation from the primary vertex of the tracks from the secondary vertex and good alignment between the reconstructed d meson momentum and flight - line  @xcite .",
