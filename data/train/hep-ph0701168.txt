    "since diakonov , petrov and polyakov  @xcite predicted in the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath6qsm ) the mass and narrow decay width of the pentaquark baryon @xmath1 with strange quantum number @xmath7 and leading quark fock structure @xmath8 , there has been an enormous amount of theoretical and experimental works ( see , for example , recent reviews for the experimental results  @xcite and for the theoretical investigations  @xcite ) .",
    "note that there is an earlier prediction by praszaowicz of the mass in the soliton approach of the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "many experiments have announced the existence of the @xmath1 after the first independent observations by the leps  @xcite and diana  @xcite collaborations , while the @xmath1 has not been seen in almost all high - energy experiments . moreover ,",
    "an exotic @xmath9 state was observed by the na49 experiment at cern  @xcite , though its existence is still under debate .",
    "a very recent clas experiment dedicated to search for the @xmath1 has announced null results of finding the @xmath1 in the reaction @xmath10",
    "the subsequent experiment has also not found any evidence for the @xmath1 in @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "though these experiments are the measurements with high statistics , it is too early to conclude the absence of the @xmath1 . note e.g. that the diana collaboration has continued to search for the @xmath1 and found the formation of a narrow @xmath12peak with mass of @xmath13 mev/@xmath14 and width of @xmath15 mev in the @xmath16 reaction  @xcite .",
    "moreover , several new experiments searching for the @xmath1 are in progress  @xcite . in this obscure status for the @xmath1 ,",
    "more efforts are required for understanding the @xmath1 theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "in addition , a recent graal experiment  @xcite announced the evidence of a new nucleon - like resonance with a seemingly narrow decay width @xmath17 mev and a mass @xmath18 mev in the @xmath19-photoproduction from the neutron target .",
    "this new nucleon - like resonance , @xmath20 , may be regarded as a non - strange pentaquark because of its narrow decay width and dominant excitation on the neutron target which are known to be characteristic for typical pentaquark baryons  @xcite , though one should not exclude a possibility that it might be one of the already known @xmath21 resonances ( possibly , @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "this graal data is consistent with the results for the transition magnetic moments in the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath6qsm )  @xcite as well as the partial - wave analysis for the non - strange pentaquark baryons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent theoretical calculation of the @xmath23 reaction  @xcite describes qualitatively well the graal data , based on the values of the transition magnetic moments in refs .",
    "@xcite , which implies that the @xmath24 seen in the graal experiment could be favorably identified as one of the pentaquark baryons .    however , there is general opinion that , if the @xmath1 exists , its width should be extremely small .",
    "its value may even possibly lie below 1 mev  @xcite .",
    "as far as theory is concerned , the decay width of the @xmath1 has been investigated in many different approaches  @xcite and is mostly estimated to be very small . in the present work , we want to study the decay width of the @xmath1 baryon within the framework of the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath6qsm ) , including the effects of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking and using the _ model - independent approach",
    "_  @xciteqsm and determines the dynamical coefficients by fitting them to experimental data .",
    "in fact the pioneering paper on @xmath25 @xcite used this method ] . recently",
    ", this approach has been applied to evaluate the magnetic moments of the baryon decuplet and antidecuplet , with parameters fixed by experimental magnetic moments of the baryon octet  @xcite and the baryon octet , decuplet , and antidecuplet mass - splittings and the mass of the @xmath1 .",
    "the same method was employed to get various transition magnetic moments  @xcite and the results are in a good agreement with the selex and graal data .",
    "thus , in the present work , we want to analyze in the same way the axial - vector coupling constant of the @xmath1 , based on the experimental data for hyperon semileptonic decay ( hsd ) constants @xmath26 and the flavor - singlet axial - vector constant of the proton @xmath0 .",
    "it is in particular interesting to use the @xmath0 as an input , since it carries information on the quark spin content of the proton .",
    "it is extracted from deep inelastic polarized electron - proton scattering and hence its information is independent of hsd .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 is related to the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath27 in ref .",
    "@xcite by the goldberger - treiman relation but there it has been neglected , its effect being assumed to be rather small . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath4 was determined by the empirical value of the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath28  @xcite . moreover , the effects of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking were neglected .    in the present work",
    ", we will perform a more general analysis of the @xmath4 , emphasizing its dependence on @xmath0 of the proton and the effects of su(3 ) symmetry breaking . while the decay constants of hsds are relatively well determined  @xcite , the value of the @xmath29 is experimentally only known to be in the range of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to examine explicitly the dependence of the @xmath4 on the @xmath0 .",
    "we will later show that the @xmath4 is rather sensitive to @xmath0 which is in contrast to the assumptions made in ref .",
    "moreover , we will see that the @xmath4 is constrained by the value of the @xmath2 . in the end",
    ", we will see that the known data on hsds and the experimental value of the @xmath0 are compatible with a small width of @xmath5  mev .",
    "using a formalism similar to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite the form factors of hsds are defined by the following transition matrix elements of the vector and axial - vector currents : @xmath31   u_{b_{1}}(p_{1}),\\cr\\langle b_{2}|a_{\\mu}^{x}|b_{1}\\rangle&=&\\bar{u}_{b_{2}}(p_{2})\\left [   g_{1 } ( q^{2})\\gamma_{\\mu}-\\frac{ig_{2}(q^{2})}{m_{1}}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}q^{\\nu } + \\frac{g_{3}(q^{2})}{m_{1}}q_{\\mu}\\right ]   \\gamma_{5}u_{b_{1}}(p_{1}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector and axial - vector currents are defined as @xmath32 with @xmath33 for strangeness conserving @xmath34 currents and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    "the form factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real quantities due to @xmath41-invariance , depending only on the square of the momentum transfer .",
    "we can safely neglect @xmath42 for the reason that its contribution to the decay rate is proportional to the ratio @xmath43 , where @xmath44 represents the mass of the lepton ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) in the final state and @xmath47 that of the baryon in the initial state .",
    "taking into account the @xmath48 rotational and @xmath49 corrections , we can write the resulting axial - vector constants @xmath50 as follows : @xmath51   , \\label{eq : g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 denote parameters encoding the specific dynamics of the chiral soliton model .",

    "denote the su(3 ) wigner matrices in representation @xmath57 .",
    "the collective hamiltonian describing baryons in the su(3 ) @xmath6qsm takes the following form @xcite : @xmath58 with the symmetry breaking piece given by : @xmath59 where parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are proportional to the strange current quark mass @xmath63 .    taking into account the recent experimental observation of the mass of @xmath1 , the parameters in eq.([hsplit ] ) can be conveniently parameterized in terms of the pion - nucleon @xmath2 term ( assuming @xmath64 ) as @xcite : @xmath65 ( in units of mev ) .",
    "moreover , the inertia parameters which describe the splittings of su(3 ) baryon mass representations take the following values ( in mev ) @xmath66 equations ( [ albega ] ) and ( [ isigma ] ) follow from the fit to the masses of octet and decuplet baryons and of @xmath1 as well . if one imposes the additional constraint that @xmath67 mev , then @xmath68 mev @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in agreement with recent experimental estimates  @xcite .",
    "however , since the measurement of @xmath69 is still under debate , we will not fix @xmath2 but vary it within a certain range , i.e. @xmath70 mev .    because the hamiltonian of eq.([hsplit ] ) mixes different su(3 )",
    "representations , the collective wave functions are given as linear combinations @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the state which reduces to the su(3 ) representation @xmath57 in the formal limit @xmath73 .",

    "<S> we obtain the numerical results of the decay width of the @xmath1 pentaquark baryon as a function of the pion - nucleon sigma term @xmath2 and investigate the dependence of the decay width of the @xmath1 on the @xmath0 , varying the @xmath0 within the range of the experimental uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the combined values of all known semileptonic decays with the generally accepted value of @xmath3 for the proton are compatible with a small decay width @xmath4 of the @xmath1 pentaquark , i.e. @xmath5  mev . </S>"
