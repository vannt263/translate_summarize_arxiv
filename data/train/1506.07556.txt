    "the latter statement allows expanding the momentum near the fermi surface in every integration ( @xmath80 in 3d ) making any momentum integral one - dimensional and fast converging .",

    "therefore , some care needs to be taken when working out the weak - localization corrections ( wlc ) to conductivity in , e.g. , the 3d case .",
    "indeed , this correction is determined by the next term in the @xmath54 expansion , and the wlc in 3d reads @xmath87 .",
    "when computing corrections to the conductivity in the 3d case , one has to take into account the values of the momentum far from the fermi surface .    as a result ,",
