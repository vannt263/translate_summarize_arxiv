    "light transmission through subwavelength holes on metallic films works beyond the traditional diffraction limit when light excites evanescent surface waves on the film @xcite .",
    "this so - called extraordinary optical transmission ( eot ) can play an important role in miniaturizing opto - electronic devices @xcite .",
    "the frequency and intensity of the eot peaks depend on how evanescent surface waves are excited by the incident light , which is determined by the geometry of the holes , as well as the intrinsic properties of the metal and surrounding dielectrics @xcite .",
    "although geometric factors of the excitation have been extensively investigated , the influence of the intrinsic properties of the metal remains to be explored . especially in the thz regime , metals are routinely treated as perfect electromagnetic conductors , completely overlooking their specific material properties .",
    "differences of the eot between good and poor conductors have been reported by comparing samples with the same structure but made from different materials @xcite . however",
    ", this comparison can be easily affected by the variation of both film thickness and hole diameter in different samples .",
    "we overcome such difficulties by investigating the temperature - dependent eot , taking advantage of a nearly continuous variation of material properties through a fine control of the temperature . besides that",
    ", we compare mgb@xmath0 ( a low - temperature superconductor ) with au ( a noble metal ) , whose complex conductivities change with temperature differently . by investigating the similarities and differences of the evolutions of the eot peaks on these two films ,",
    "we demonstrate _ the influence of intrinsic material properties on eot in the thz regime_.    an outcome of this study , for future possible applications of subwavelength optics , is that _ the eot on metallic films can be tuned effectively by just varying the temperature_. previously , temperature control of eot was realized either by changing the properties of dielectric surroundings @xcite , or by using thin films made of doped semiconductors @xcite . here",
    "we report a @xmath1 increase in the maximum transmittance of a gold film when the temperature decreases from 300 k to 5 k , which is attributed to the change of the properties of gold with temperature .",
    "observe eot on thin films of yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , a high - temperature superconductor .",
    "here we use mgb@xmath0 , a low - temperature superconductor , whose low temperature properties are described more accurately by using bcs theory .",
    "we observe that both the intensity and the shape of the eot peaks change when mgb@xmath0 enters the superconducting phase . through a comparison of eot peaks at different frequencies ,",
    "we explore how the interplay between superconductivity and eot depends on both the temperature and the frequency .",
    "we grew c - axis - oriented mgb@xmath0 films @xcite , and also au films , on mgo substrates .",
    "wedged [ 111 ] mgo substrates were used to avoid the interference of light between the front and back surfaces of each substrate .",
    "the @xmath4-axis oriented mgb@xmath0 films were grown by the hybrid physical - chemical vapor deposition technique .",
    "the au film was grown by magnetron sputtering .",
    "both the mgb@xmath0 and au films were 50 nm thick , which was checked by measuring their cross - section thickness under a scanning electron microscope .",
    "ultraviolet lithography and reactive ionic etching were used for patterning the arrays of holes .",
    "the superconducting transition of the fabricated mgb@xmath0 film occurred at 37.6 k , with a transition width of 0.3 k [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] . meanwhile , our gold films showed the typical behavior of a normal metal in the entire temperature range .",
    "each pattern was a square array of circular holes , with a total effective area of @xmath5 mm@xmath6 .",
    "samples and a bare mgo substrate were put into an optical cryostat .",
    "temperature was varied from 300 k to 5 k. the transmittance spectra of the samples and the substrate were taken in a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( abb bomem da8 ) .",
    "the light had a normal incidence , with its beam diameter limited , by a diaphragm , to 5 mm .",
    "the transmittance of the samples was obtained by subtracting the spectra of the substrate from the spectra of the samples .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the transmittance of a mgb film and a gold film at 300 k. the lattice constant of the hole array of both samples is 50 @xmath7 m and the hole diameter is 25 @xmath7 m .",
    "transmission peaks at approximately 60 @xmath8 ( or 1.8 thz ) and 85 @xmath8 ( or 2.5 thz ) are observed in both samples .",
    "these are the eot peaks because their corresponding wavelengths are far larger than the hole diameter @xcite , and can be assigned to the ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) modes of the metal / mgo interface , respectively @xcite .",
    "light transmission spectra at 300 k show the combined effects of the geometry of the array of holes , as well as the intrinsic properties of the metallic and dielectric materials .",
    "indeed , _ varying the temperature highlights the effect of the material properties_. figure [ fig2 ] shows how the spectra around 60 @xmath8 change when decreasing the temperature .",
    "the spectral peak of the au film becomes narrower and shows a small blue shift , and the peak intensity increases smoothly [ figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](d ) ] .",
    "such a trend continues down to the lowest measured temperature of 5 k. for the mgb@xmath0 film , the spectra show similar behaviors as those of the au film in the normal state [ fig . [ fig2](c ) ] .",
    "however , in the superconducting state , the spectra exhibit qualitatively different behaviors from the normal state . in the superconducting state [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] , the peak becomes slightly _ broader _ ( instead of _ narrower _ ) and shows a very slight _ red _ shift , instead of the _ blue _ shift observed before , as the temperature is decreased .",
    "moreover , the spectra show a fano line - shape @xcite with the high - frequency side of the peak being nearly independent of the temperature and the low - frequency side becoming broader at low temperatures , resulting in a very slight increase of the asymmetry of the fano line - shape .",
    "this very small increase in the asymmetry could be the result of the increase in the available low - lying quasi - particle states , which act as the continuum channel of the fano resonance .",
    "the maximum transmittance increases with decreasing temperature in the entire temperature range , with a much faster increase rate in the superconducting state than in the normal state [ fig . [ fig2](a ) ] . for both mgb@xmath0 and au films ,",
    "the effect of changing temperature is much more pronounced on the peak intensity than on the peak frequency . because the eot peak frequency and intensity correspond to the eigen - mode and magnitude of evanescent surface waves , respectively ,",
    "we conclude that , the eigen - modes of evanescent surface waves are slightly modified , while their amplitudes increase significantly with decreasing temperature .    the spectral line - shape and their temperature dependence shown above can be described through the change of the complex conductivity @xmath9 @xmath10 of mgb@xmath0 and au . because mgb@xmath0 is a conventional bcs superconductor , its complex conductivity in the superconducting state",
    "can be calculated using bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the obtained temperature - dependent values of @xmath11 at 60 @xmath8 are shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) . in the superconducting state , with decreasing temperature @xmath12 decreases while @xmath13 increases , which reflects the opening of the superconducting gap and the depletion of thermally - excited quasiparticles when the temperature decreases .",
    "meanwhile , we calculate @xmath14 using an extended drude model @xcite , and the calculated values at 60 @xmath8 are shown in fig . [ fig3](c ) . for au ,",
    "in contrast to mgb@xmath0 in the superconducting state , both @xmath12 and @xmath13 increase with decreasing temperature , due to the increase in electron relaxation time coming from the suppression of electron - phonon scattering at low temperatures .",
    "the complex relative permittivity @xmath15 @xmath16 of both materials is also shown in figs . [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](c ) , which is obtained through the equation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the permittivity of free space , and @xmath19 is the angular frequency .",
    "we stress there are _ no adjustable parameters _ in the above calculations ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "the transmission spectra at different temperatures are then obtained by analytically solving maxwell s equations @xcite using the obtained @xmath11 and @xmath14 , with representative spectra shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](d ) .",
    "the film thickness and lattice constant are experimental values .",
    "square holes are adopted in the model @xcite , with its side length as 5 @xmath7 m .",
    "the area of the holes in the calculation is smaller than the experimental value , which may be due to the difference in the cut - off wavelength and the electromagnetic field distribution between square holes ( in the calculations ) and circular holes ( in the experiments ) .",
    "the temperature - dependent features , such as the spectral line - shape and intensity , of the eot peaks on both films are reproduced ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "here we use relatively thin films , so the light may transmit through the unperforated part of the film .",
    "we note that several previous reports on light transmission through artificial structures on superconducting thin films did not consider this direct transmission .",
    "the transmittance of a plain superconducting film changes significantly with temperature in the frequency range below and near the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the temperature - dependent characteristics of this direct transmission can mix up with those of the eot .",
    "this can be a serious problem when the film thickness is less than the skin depth . without considering and excluding the possibility of direct transmission , investigations on the optical properties of superconducting films with artificial structures are prone to error . in our work",
    ", the possible influence of the direct transmission on the eot has been excluded because : 1 ) the high - frequency and the low - frequency sides of the spectra show different temperature dependences ( fig . [ fig2](b ) ) ; 2 ) these temperature - dependent characteristics are reproduced by the analytical solution ( fig . [ fig3](b ) ) where the direct transmission is assumed to be zero in amplitude .",
    "so we conclude that the variation in spectra reveals the change of light transmission due to eot , which originates from the temperature dependence of the intrinsic properties of mgb@xmath0 and au .",
    "we notice that the eot peaks in mgb@xmath0 and au films are significantly higher at low temperatures , with their @xmath12 change in opposite directions with decreasing temperature [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ] .",
    "this is quite different from reports on either doped semiconductor films in thz , or metal films at higher frequencies @xcite , where an increase in @xmath12 generally corresponds to a decrease in eot intensity .",
    "this is because films have @xmath20 for either doped semiconductors in the thz regime , or noble metals in the visible and near - infrared regimes .",
    "so @xmath12 can be safely treated as a small perturbation in the theoretical analysis , which describes the dissipation of evanescent surface waves , and relates with the eot peak width and strength . in our experiment ,",
    "both mgb@xmath0 and au films have @xmath21 .",
    "so both @xmath12 and @xmath13 have to be treated together to describe the thz eot of perforated metallic films .",
    "to achieve this , we incorporate @xmath12 and @xmath13 into the parameters of the skin depth @xmath22 , which describes the depth the electromagnetic field penetrates into metallic films . in the thz regime , where metals have @xmath23 , @xmath24^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the speed of light in vacuum @xcite .",
    "although @xmath11 and @xmath14 have different temperature dependences , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 decrease monotonously , as both materials become better electromagnetic conductors with decreasing temperature .",
    "holes on the films form an array of open resonators , where evanescent surface waves resonate with incident and transmitted light @xcite .",
    "the total quality factor of these resonators includes a term @xmath27 , which describes the dissipation of evanescent surface waves in these resonators . for a closed resonator with highly conductive boundaries : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a geometric factor describing the shape of the cavity @xcite . because the electromagnetic field is highly confined inside subwavelength holes in the thz regime @xcite",
    ", open and closed resonators should have a similar @xmath27 . because both @xmath25 and @xmath26 decrease with decreasing temperature , @xmath27 increases for both films at low temperatures .",
    "this explains why at low temperatures the intensity of the eot increases for both mgb@xmath0 and au films .",
    "this qualitative insight also explains another apparent discrepancy between our experiments and calculations on metal films at higher frequencies @xcite . in our experiments ,",
    "the eot peaks for both mgb@xmath0 and au films increase in intensity when these materials approach the prefect - conductor limit . however , the eot intensity in noble metal films can be higher than that in perfect - conducting films in the visible and near - infrared regime , which is attributed to the finite value of the skin depth in real metals @xcite .",
    "this is because in the visible and near - infrared regime , the hole diameter is usually only slightly larger than @xmath22 .",
    "so a change in @xmath22 will result in a significant enlargement of the effective hole diameter and thus influencing the geometric factor @xmath29 in ref .",
    "however , in our experiments @xmath29 is nearly constant .",
    "this can be seen as follows : @xmath30 370 nm and 40 nm for the superconducting mgb@xmath0 and au in our experiments , respectively .",
    "thus , our hole diameter is several orders of magnitude larger than our @xmath22 ; so the change in @xmath22 does not significantly influence the effective hole size and results in a nearly constant g. thus , in our case , the change in eot intensity is only a reflection of the change of @xmath22 .",
    "evanescent surface waves on superconducting mgb@xmath0 films have very low dissipation , because cooper pairs have a pure inductive response to the driven optical field at finite frequency below the superconducting energy gap @xcite . since photons with energy larger than the superconducting energy gap can break cooper pairs , the effect of the superconducting transition on the eot is expected to be much weaker when the frequency goes up .",
    "to examine this , we investigated three eot peaks with different frequencies [ fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] .",
    "two of the peaks ( a , c ) are from the mgb@xmath0 sample discussed above , and another peak ( b ) is from another mgb@xmath0 sample with a different periodicity of the hole array .",
    "details regarding the sample pattern and temperature - dependent spectra are available in appendix [ appendixb ] . mgb@xmath0 has two superconducting energy gaps and the lower one @xmath31 43 @xmath32 $ ] dominates its optical properties @xcite .",
    "these three eot peaks correspond to the regime : slightly lower ( b ) , slightly higher ( a ) , and much higher ( c ) than @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) that a phase transition is clearly revealed in the temperature - dependent transmittance maxima only for peaks with energy slightly lower and slightly higher than @xmath33 .",
    "the phase transition can still be identified from the line - shape change of the spectra ( see appendix [ appendixb ] ) , but the change of transmittance maximum is much weaker for the peak ( c ) with energy much higher than @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig4](b ) shows the calculated conductivity of mgb@xmath0 at 5 k ( in the superconducting state ) and 40 k ( in the normal state ) based on the mattis - bardeen model @xcite .",
    "the difference between the conductivity at two temperatures diminishes for higher frequencies ; indeed , in the visible or near - infrared regime , this difference should be very small .",
    "we also investigated eot peaks in the mid - infrared regime ( see appendix [ appendixb ] ) , but there the superconducting transition can not be identified in our spectra .",
    "in conclusion , we show that light transmission through subwavelength hole arrays on metallic thin films can be controlled by modifying the intrinsic electronic properties of the films .",
    "the real part of the conductivity alone can not describe the strength and width of the eot peaks in the thz regime .",
    "the temperature dependence of the eot peaks is understood within the open resonator model , where both the real and the imaginary parts of the conductivity are taken into consideration . as we have shown , the effect of the superconducting transition on the eot depends on the ratio of the superconducting energy gap to the frequency of the eot .",
    "besides the _ temperature control _ used here , the superconducting energy gap can be easily tuned with a magnetic field or an electric current , providing additional interesting ways to control the eot of superconducting films ( see appendix [ appendixc ] for more detailed discussion ) .",
