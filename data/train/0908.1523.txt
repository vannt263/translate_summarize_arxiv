    "is maximal @xcite . until now only upper bounds on the neutrino mass of @xmath1  have been determined @xcite . in 2001",
    "the international collaboration katrin @xcite was established to build a new tritium @xmath2-decay experiment .",
    "the katrin experiment is based on the experimental experience of its predecessor experiments in mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite and aims to improve their sensitivity on the neutrino rest mass by one order of magnitude to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "katrin is using an integrating spectrometer of mac - e filter type @xcite for the energy analysis of the  electrons .",
    "for such a device the stability of the energy analysis relies primarily on the stability of the electrostatic filter potential @xcite .",
    "the stability of the latter has been identified as one of the five main contributions to the uncertainty of katrin @xcite . in order to keep the high sensitivity on the neutrino mass",
    ", the contribution of the retarding potential to the systematic error has to be limited to @xmath4 .",
    "any unknown filter potential fluctuation with a gaussian variance @xmath5 leads to a shift of the measured squared neutrino rest mass @xmath6 . the general relation",
    "how systematic uncertainties affect the neutrino mass value is @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the elementary charge . due to the given systematic error limit this leads to a maximum uncertainty of the filter potential of @xmath9v which corresponds to an allowed relative stability of the voltage monitoring system of @xmath10 at a filter potential of @xmath11kv",
    "this stability limit has to be kept for the anticipated katrin measurement time of three years , which corresponds to a calendar time of about five years .",
    "the relative precision of the retarding potential is of primary importance , whereas the absolute precision , which includes also the contributions of work - functions and chemical shifts , is of less importance , since the endpoint of the @xmath2-spectrum is fitted from the data .",
    "still , the katrin experiment will use the absolute endpoint position obtained from the data to compare it to the @xmath12he-@xmath12h mass difference @xcite , thus serving as an important check of the systematic corrections .",
    "+ by precisely measuring the high voltage potential as well as by measuring the line position of a mono - energetic electron source , two redundant monitoring solutions will be applied @xcite . for the latter method",
    "the filter potential of the katrin main mac - e filter will be continuously monitored by means of a monitor beam - line consisting of the mac - e filter setup of the former mainz neutrino mass experiment . while being connected to the same filter potential as the main filter , mono - energetic electron calibration sources like  will be operated at the monitor beam - line .",
    "hence we are able to lock the main filter relative to the electron energy of the calibration source at the monitor filter . for supplying the energy filters at both beam - lines with a stable high voltage potential we use state - of - the - art , commercially available , high voltage equipment with a stability of @xmath13 per eight hours .",
    "high - end measurement equipment to monitor voltages in the 10 v range with a relative precision at the sub - ppm level is commercially available also .",

    "+ the inner setup comprises four sections subdivided by five control electrodes made of polished copper and supported by a set of polyoxymethylene ( pom ) rods , see figures [ fig : electrode ] , [ fig : skizze1 ] .",

    "the layout of the entire divider circuit is shown in . in the four upper sections of the divider",
    "100 resistors of @xmath20 m@xmath15 are arranged in a helix structure , each section comprises 25 resistors .",
    "the remaining 6 resistors , @xmath18 k@xmath15 each , provide two low voltage outputs . therefore two groups of three resistors in parallel are arranged subsequent to the 100 precision resistors .",
    "one such group provides a divider ratio of 3945:1 , both together provide 1972:1 , thus allowing precise measurements in the @xmath21  v and in the @xmath22  v range , as needed by katrin .",
    "+ except for the top electrode , all copper electrodes have a centred bore to fit an acrylic tube , which  by means of appropriate drillings",

    "the control divider output consists of two standard resistors of @xmath19  k@xmath15 each and does not need to be calibrated . in this way the applied voltage can be monitored with low precision and independent of the precision divider .",
    "the hv resistors of the control divider provide a linear voltage distribution in all sections , guaranteeing each precision resistor being placed in an electrostatic potential according to its voltage .",
    "the capacitors of the control divider protect the precision resistors of the high - precision divider from transient overloads , e.g. when the direct high voltage is switched on or off ( see ) .",

    "+ the divider setup is contained in a cylindrical stainless steel vessel filled at standard atmospheric pressure with dry n@xmath29 as insulation gas .",
    "flowing across the precision resistors , the insulation gas is used for temperature stabilization and heat transfer . due to its operation in high magnetic fields close to the main mac - e filter of the katrin experiment",
    ", the vessel has to be non - magnetic .",
    "it is mounted on top of a mobile 19 \" rack , which contains the equipment for temperature control and the interface to the katrin slow control network ( see ) .",
    "high precision hermetically sealed and oil - filled resistors based on the bulk metal foil technology have been chosen to equip the resistor chain of the high - precision divider .",
    "those resistors are specified for voltages of up to 600v , they are available with temperature coefficients ( tcr ) of @xmath30 and with high resistance values of up to @xmath31 m@xmath15 .",
    "their design is non inductive and non capacitive and their specified voltage coefficient of resistance ( vcr ) is @xmath32 .",
    "according to the specifications published by the manufacturer the resistors show a long - term stability of @xmath33 in one year shelf life is given . ] and @xmath34 in load life w and a temperature of 60 @xmath35c . ] .",
    "this drift is mainly caused by an ageing effect of the resistor material and is supposed to decrease with time . with these values the resistors are about one order of magnitude less precise than the wire - wound resistors used in the ptb standard divider @xcite , which are not anymore commercially available . the load life stability can be improved by a special pre - ageing procedure , but this procedure has not been applied to the chosen resistors of type vha-518/11 .",
    "+ under load each resistor shows a characteristic warm - up deviation of the resistance value which is strongly correlated to the internal temperature increase and the temperature coefficient of resistance .",
    "this effect is visible even within the specified tcr and vcr values ( see ) and can be reduced by a careful screening procedure . therefore the 100 resistors of 1.84 m@xmath15 for the high - precision divider have been selected from a lot of 200 resistors by investigating their warm - up deviation .",
    "the screening procedure has been performed within a shielded chamber ( see ) at a stabilized ambient temperature of @xmath36c .",
    "the measurement circuit that has been used is shown in figure [ fig : meas - circuit ] ; it consists of a calibrated voltage source , one test resistor at a time , the low resistance reference resistor , and a @xmath37 digit voltmeter ( agilent 3458a ) .",
    "the calibrated voltage source ( fluke 5720a ) supplies the test voltage of @xmath38  v with low noise and high stability at the @xmath39 range .",
    "the test resistor ( @xmath40 m@xmath15 ) and the fifty times smaller reference resistor ( @xmath41 k@xmath15 ) create a simple voltage divider . due to this , 588.2 v of the applied voltage occurs across the test resistor , whereas 11.8 v occurs across the reference resistor .        with @xmath42",
    "mw the wattage at the test resistor is 50 times higher than at the reference resistor with @xmath43  mw , hence we can expect that the test resistor will warm up while the effect at the reference resistor is negligible . when logging the change of the voltage drop at the reference resistor we directly measure the warm - up effect of the test resistor . in figure",
    "[ fig : res - compare ] it is shown how the initial warm - up deviation stabilizes after about 10 minutes for a typical resistor sample compared to the unstable characteristic of an exceptional bad resistor .",
    "only resistors whose measured warm - up characteristic matches the following limits are used in the setup :    * temperature coefficient of resistance ( tcr ) : @xmath44 . *",
    "reproducible and stable operation after @xmath45 minutes . * rms of final resistance value @xmath46 after warm - up . * warm - up deviation of resistance : @xmath47 after 25 minutes .    during operation at the katrin experiment",
    "the nominal voltage across each resistor will be less than 200  v in tritium measurement mode when measuring energies around 18.6  kev , with a maximum of 350  v during calibration runs when investigating the  conversion electrons at energies of up to 32  kev . in order to investigate the maximal warm - up effect ,",
    "the maximal rated voltage of 600  v per resistor has been applied to the test circuit , i.e. a load of 588.2  v at the test resistor .",
    "the relative deviation of the resistance value has been monitored for 25 minutes after switching - on .",
    "after the initial warm - up process is finished and the resistor reached thermal equilibrium , the resistance value becomes stable , as shown in for 588.2  v load and in for 490  v load . by analysing the warm - up deviation against the independently measured tcr value a mean temperature increase of @xmath48c in each 1.84  m@xmath15 resistor can be deduced ( see ) .     at a load of @xmath49  v with the independently measured temperature coefficient of resistance for five resistors .",
    "the upper plot shows the linear fit to the data , whereas the differences to the straight line of the linear fit are plotted below .",
    ", height=415 ]    within their specification resistors with positive and negative tcr exist , thus positive and negative warm - up deviations occur .",
    "this property is a result of the bulk metal foil , since it is based on strain gauge technology .",
    "the resistor foil with positive tcr is glued on a ceramic substrate , which shows very low thermal expansion .",
    "the thermal expansion of the resistor foil leads to a rise in resistance , but since it is glued on the substrate a mechanical stress occurs , which leads to a decrease of its resistance .",
    "the low tcr value of the final resistor is achieved by carefully balancing the expansion factors , the glue method , and the substrate material .",
    "since we investigated the resistors within their specifications , we are sensitive to whether the remaining tcr is positive or negative .    by combining pairs of resistors with identical but different signed warm - up deviations",
    ", we were able to reduce the combined warm - up deviation by more than one order of magnitude , see figure [ fig : warm - up ] .",
    "finally , pairs or even groups of up to four resistors which in sum show the lowest combined warm - up deviation are used for assembling the resistor chain of the high - precision divider .",
    "the resistors of those pairs and groups are mounted in adjacent positions in order to have identical ambient conditions should there be instabilities in the internal temperature .",
    "based on the single resistor results , the combined warm - up deviation of the resistance of all 100 selected resistors should be less than @xmath50 at a load of @xmath49  v per resistor , which is a two orders of magnitude improvement on the average value of a single resistor .",
    "+ the six 140  k@xmath15 resistors providing the divider ratios are chosen from a lot of 15 resistors ; they are matched by reducing their combined temperature coefficient of resistance as well .",
    "no significant warm - up deviation is expected for those resistors because in this part of the divider setup the voltage drop is less than 10  v per resistor .",
    "at the laboratory for instrument transformers and high voltage of the ptb braunschweig we investigated the new high voltage divider in comparison with the ptb reference divider mt100 , one of the most precise high voltage dividers in the world , at direct voltages between @xmath51 kv and @xmath52 kv . both dividers ( mt100 , katrin )",
    "have been connected to a common precision hv source , thus minimizing the influence of high voltage variations .",
    "the mt100 divider has been upgraded with an additional scale factor of 3334:1 in order to cover the whole range of the precision voltmeter ( hp 3458a , 10 v range ) when applying voltages below 35 kv .",
    "the mt100 and katrin divider output voltages have been monitored by state - of - the - art @xmath37 digit voltmeters of type hp 3458a and fluke 8508a , respectively .",
    "a 10  v reference source of type fluke 732a , calibrated against ptb s josephson voltage standard @xcite , has been used to re - calibrate both digital voltmeters in order to compensate gain and offset deviations before and after each measurement run .",
    "thermoelectric voltages in particular have to be taken into account when measuring in the 10  v range at @xmath53 relative precision . in order to reduce any thermoelectric influence , only gold - plated or cu - te connectors were used for the measurement chain .",
    "in addition , by encapsulating readout contact pairs of the same material , we achieve identical thermal gradients on both polarities , thus thermoelectric voltages cancel .",
    "the thermoelectric effect inside the divider housing is expected to be negligible , since the internal temperature of the whole setup is being stabilized . in this configuration",
    "the externally applied voltage @xmath54 is related to both divider readings @xmath55 , @xmath56 and both scale factors @xmath57 , @xmath58 according to @xmath59 for the scale factor of the katrin divider this yields : @xmath60 series of measurements have been performed repeatedly with identical settings , but independent from one another .",
    "data sets of these measurements have been combined by compiling a mean value for each time step after applying the voltage . in order to examine the effect of the scale factor uncertainty on the voltage reading ,",
    "the relative deviation of the scale factor @xmath61 based on a reference value @xmath62 is of interest : @xmath63 depending on the objective of the analysis , the initial , the final , or the average value is used for @xmath64 .",
    "+ the main focus of the investigation at ptb was the switching - on deviation , the linearity , and long - term stability of @xmath58 . during katrin measurement",
    "runs the nominal voltage to be monitored is @xmath65  kv . in order to take advantage of the whole scale ( 10  v range ) of the precision voltmeter",
    "the 1972:1 output is the optimal choice for the given voltage .",
    "the latter configuration has therefore been investigated thoroughly and repeatedly in two calibration campaigns in 2005 and 2006 with a time gap of 13 months .",
    "measurements performed to check the 3945:1 output show no unanticipated behaviour compared to the 1972:1 output . in the following subsections the results for the 1972:1 output of the katrin divider are presented .",
    "a summary of the results for both scale factors is shown in .",
    "directly after applying the high voltage to the divider , a small warm - up deviation is expected .",
    "this is due to the residual warm - up effect occurring even after the mutual matching has been performed according to the individual warm - up characteristics and the tcrs of the single resistors . for the mt100 divider",
    "it has been demonstrated that this initial warm - up effect is @xmath66 independent of the applied voltage @xcite . for the katrin divider",
    "the warm - up deviation has been investigated at @xmath67  kv and @xmath52  kv for both scale factors . in all cases ,",
    "the relative warm - up deviation of the scale factor is about @xmath68 during the first two minutes of operation ; in addition a reproducibility in the @xmath53 range has been observed relative to the absolute scale factor values . + an example is shown in ; here the warm - up effect at the 1972:1 output at @xmath52  kv is plotted as a function of time after applying high voltage .",
    "five independent measurements have been performed , the average of all measurements per time step is plotted as well as statistical error bars .",
    "the remaining fluctuations are dominated by noise from the voltmeter reading .",
    "the exponential fit ( dashed line ) gives a relative amplitude of about @xmath68 for the warm - up effect with an exponential time constant of @xmath69 min .",
    "the scale factor stabilizes after two minutes  after one it is not quite at equilibrium .",
    "this effect has been taken into account in the measurements reported in .",
    "the remaining deviation of the mean value plus standard deviation keeps stable within a relative deviation of @xmath70 . since there are five measurements averaged this is a direct demonstration of a reproducibility in the @xmath53 range .",
    "+ it can be summarized that after a short warm - up time the initial scale factor deviation is negligible and stabilizes with a relative reproducibility in the low @xmath53 range , independent of the chosen divider output or operation voltage .",
    "additionally , since the warm - up effect measured in 2005 has been reproduced in the 2006 measurements , we conclude that it is stable and reproducible for at least 13 months .      for the katrin experiment ,",
    "calibration and monitoring procedures at voltages between @xmath71  kv and @xmath52  kv are intended .",
    "a crucial property of a divider is the linearity of the scale factor over the voltage range of interest .",
    "+ due to the fixed scale factors of the voltage divider of 1972:1 and 3945:1 , which have been optimized for scaling down voltages of about @xmath67  kv to the @xmath21  v range of precision digital voltmeters , the systematic uncertainty of the low voltage measurement increases significantly at primary voltages @xmath72  kv , e.  g. when reading low voltages of less than @xmath73  v the relative uncertainty of the reading of high precision voltmeters exceeds @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , the linearity of the katrin divider has been investigated at voltages between @xmath51  kv to @xmath52  kv with @xmath75  kv steps .",
    "hence , when setting the high voltage to @xmath51  kv , low voltages of about @xmath76  v have to be read at the 1972:1 output of the new divider and about @xmath77  v at the 3334:1 output of the mt100 divider , respectively .",
    "+ each of the voltage steps has been applied for two minutes , whereas only the data of the second minute has been evaluated due to the initial warm - up effect which is reported in section [ inidev ] .",
    "the combined result of all five independent linearity investigations is shown in figure [ fig : linearity ] .",
    "each plotted scale factor incorporates the average of all measurements for the same voltage setting .",
    "as expected , the spread and the uncertainty increase at voltages @xmath72  kv . at voltages @xmath78  kv and especially at a wide band around the tritium endpoint energy , the linearity of the divider is in the @xmath53 range . here , the spread is less than @xmath79 , which has been reproduced in all five independent measurement runs .",
    "+ the slope at the high voltage end indicates a voltage dependence that has to be investigated in more detail .",
    "since the wattage increases quadratically with the applied voltage , the self heating of each resistor should increase quadratically as well . the fit function @xmath80 accounts for this case and",
    "yields a zero voltage scale factor @xmath81 and the wattage coefficient @xmath82 . in the fit of to",
    "the data delivers @xmath83 and @xmath84 with a reduced @xmath85 of @xmath86 .",
    "the result of this evaluation has large uncertainties since the measurement time and statistics of the linearity scan is limited .",
    "+ therefore , nine independent long - term measurements with a voltage stepping of @xmath51  kv , @xmath87  kv , @xmath88  kv , and @xmath52  kv have been performed . in order to assure stable measurement conditions and higher statistics ,",
    "each voltage setting has been applied and monitored for four hours .",
    "shows the result of all measurements at the 1972:1 output by plotting the evaluated average per measurement and voltage and the overall average per voltage . in order to account for the wattage effect a quadratic fit is applied .",
    "it yields a zero voltage scale factor of @xmath89 and a wattage coefficient of @xmath90 which is in agreement with the linearity measurement done earlier . in the voltage range of @xmath51  kv to @xmath52  kv",
    "this leads  if unaccounted  to a relative deviation of @xmath91 due to the voltage dependence and the wattage effect accordingly . taking into account the whole voltage range from zero to @xmath92  kv the relative deviation increases to @xmath93 , which is still well within the requirements of the katrin experiment .",
    "+ for the 3945:1 output one gets a similar result with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which corresponds to a relative deviation of @xmath96 in total for the voltage range @xmath51  kv to @xmath52  kv .",
    "accordingly , the relative deviation over the whole voltage range from zero to @xmath92  kv is @xmath97 , which is still well within the requirements of the katrin experiment as well .",
    "+ the voltage dependence results for both scale factors agree within their uncertainty and since this result has been measured in 2005 and reproduced in 2006 we can conclude that the effect is stable and that the scale factor deviations due to voltage dependence and wattage effect are well below the uncertainty limit for the katrin experiment .",
    "moreover , based on these results linearized voltage coefficients of both scale factors can be derived from @xmath98 for a certain retarding potential @xmath99 . in the case of katrin",
    "the most commonly monitored voltage will be @xmath100  kv which corresponds to the energy filter setting at the tritium endpoint . at this",
    "voltage yields a linearized voltage coefficient of @xmath101  kv@xmath102 for the 1972:1 output and @xmath103  kv@xmath102 for the 3945:1 output respectively .",
    "this shows that the voltage dependence is negligible in the tritium endpoint investigations for the neutrino mass determination .",
    "although the new divider is equipped with a sophisticated temperature control , showing a maximum fluctuation of only @xmath104  k , the temperature dependence of both outputs has been investigated at @xmath105c and at @xmath106c . during this test",
    "the environmental temperature in the lab was stable at @xmath107c . in the beginning , the whole setup has been operated at a stable temperature control set - point of @xmath105c .",
    "after several hours of stable operation the temperature has been increased to @xmath106c by adjusting the temperature control set - point .",
    "after the scale factor reading had settled and the divider has been running under stable conditions again , the high temperature scale factor value was measured for several hours . finally , the temperature control set - point has been set back to the initial value of @xmath105c in order to reproduce the initial scale factor value .",
    "the relative temperature deviation found for the 1972:1 output is @xmath108 .",
    "the result for the 3945:1 output is @xmath109 .",
    "both values are far lower than the temperature coefficients of any commercial high voltage divider , which is again a measure for the quality achieved by the screening and matching procedure of the precision resistors . + in order to check the performance of the internal temperature stabilization , the divider has been operated at environmental temperatures between @xmath110c and @xmath106c with a temperature control set - point of @xmath105c . in this test it has been demonstrated that the internal temperature stabilization is able to maintain stable conditions at environmental temperatures of up to @xmath111c . since we expect temperatures of @xmath112c in the laboratory environment of katrin , we can expect a stable operation of the divider without any temperature dependence . + we conclude that with respect to the fluctuations of the temperature control , the temperature dependence of both outputs as well as of the complete set - up under laboratory conditions is negligible . on the other hand",
    "the difference in sign and value between both scale factors indicates the technical limit of the matching procedure of the precision resistors used in the low voltage tap of the divider .      in order to investigate the scale factor stability during medium - term measurement runs ,",
    "a series of three 15 hours long overnight measurements has been performed at a voltage of @xmath67  kv and at stable environmental conditions .",
    "all measurements have been averaged time - step by time - step , the result is plotted in . in order to investigate the presence of a time dependent drift of the scale factor ,",
    "a linear fit has been applied yielding a slope of @xmath113 per day with @xmath114 .",
    "the average scale factor of this data - set is @xmath115 with a relative standard deviation of @xmath116 .",
    "hence , no significant drift can be observed as long as the environmental conditions are stable .",
    "changing the room temperature conditions results in a small deviation , see the deviation at @xmath117  h when the door of the laboratory has been opened in the morning .",
    "this is no effect of the voltage divider , but of auxiliary equipment like the digital voltmeters . with this result",
    "the one day stability of the divider can be rated as significantly lower than the katrin stability limit .",
    "nevertheless , no statement on the scale factor drift or an extrapolation over longer time periods is reasonable , based on this kind of medium - term measurements .      as pointed out in section [ medium - term ]",
    ", it was not feasible to derive a significant long - term deviation by a single measurement nor by the entire measurement campaign at ptb . in order to make a reasonable statement on the long - term stability a longer time interval",
    "is needed , therefore the absolute scale factor results of both measurement campaigns in october 2005 and in november 2006 have been compared with each other .",
    "the absolute scale factor values of both measurement campaigns have been derived by averaging all measurement runs with at least two hours of measurement time and independent of the voltage setting .",
    "the resulting absolute scale factors of each measurement campaign are listed in . between the 2005 and the 2006 measurements , several parts of the precision low voltage measurement equipment at ptb",
    "have been improved further , resulting in lower uncertainties of both scale factor results of 2006 . comparing the values of both years / year .",
    "] we derive a relative scale factor drift of @xmath118/month for the 1972:1 output and @xmath119/month for the 3945:1 output .",
    "these values are supported by a comparison of measurements of the k-32 conversion electrons of  in 2006 and 2007 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that those small values are not detectable in a single day measurement nor over several days of measurements .",
    "a possible explanation for this drift is the ageing effect of the precision resistors , which have not been pre - aged during the production process . according to their specifications ( see )",

    "summarizing the investigation of the katrin precision high voltage divider compared with the reference divider of ptb braunschweig , it is obvious that the resistor screening and matching according to the warm - up deviation was successful .",
    "it was possible to improve the stability of the combined set - up by more than one order of magnitude compared to the properties of a single resistor .",
    "in addition the temperature dependence of the divider is one order of magnitude lower than that of a single resistor . due to the temperature stabilization of the whole set - up and its independence of the lab temperature in a certain range ,",
    "the net temperature dependence of the voltage reading is negligible .",
    "the warm - up deviation of the katrin divider has been reduced to about @xmath68 relative to the scale factor and remained stable over all measurements in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "the voltage and wattage dependence of the scale factors over the specified voltage range has even been reduced to a relative deviation of less than @xmath68 if not corrected , otherwise it is even smaller . moreover , at the voltage setting for tritium endpoint investigations at @xmath65  kv the linearized voltage coefficient is negligible . with these properties the new divider fulfils the requirement of the katrin experiment of a relative stability of less than @xmath120 .",
    "+ especially during one cycle of data taking , i.e. one cycle of the source of 60 days , the precision and stability is better than specified .",
    "but since a long - term drift of the setup of @xmath157 ( 1972:1 output ) has been observed , it is recommended to re - calibrate the scale factors twice a year or to perform an on - line calibration during data taking in order to compare different data taking cycles with each other .",
    "the latter will be done with the katrin monitor spectrometer in parallel with the katrin main beam - line . while measuring the tritium spectrum at the main beam - line , it is intended to monitor a mono - energetic conversion electron source based on the isomeric state of the isotope  at the monitor spectrometer . in this way it is possible to monitor the scale factor drift of the divider and to re - calibrate it frequently .",
    "however , independent re - calibration investigations will be performed at ptb as well . for redundancy reasons and in order to prevent down - time of the katrin measurement during the calibration at ptb , a second divider is being built .",
    "several improvements applied to its design , especially the use of pre - aged and optimized precision resistors of the same brand , promise further improvement in overall and in long - term stability .",
