    "therefore the leading contributions to the raman response come from the 2-triplon sector .",
    "it was shown earlier that the two - triplon contribution is the dominant part of the raman response at low and intermediate energies@xcite .",
    "the role of the four - triplon contribution for the high - energy spectral weight will be discussed at the end of this work .",

    "it is therefore important to figure out which laser energy has to be used for the comparison between the non - resonant theory and the experiment in order to study the magnetic excitations only .",

    "the intensity of the two - triplon peak develops in the same way as the optical conductivity . for the non - resonant regime both , energy of the incident and",
    "scattered light , should be smaller than the charge transfer gap ( sr14 : @xmath67 ev ) .",
    "thus , we have chosen spectra with laser energies @xmath68 ev in the case of sr14 and @xmath69 ev for sr123 .",
    "luckily , the value of the optical conductivity is about 100 @xmath70@xmath13 in the sub gap regime at @xmath71 ev@xcite ( which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than for the 2d cuprates @xcite ) yielding a non vanishing intensity of the two - triplon peak . here",
    "@xmath72 denotes the energy of the two - triplon peak .",
    "the second criterion arises from the polarization dependence of the two - triplon peak .",
    "depending on the laser energy used one can observe a drastic difference in the line shape between the two polarizations@xcite . while the difference in the line shapes",
    "is large for @xmath73 ev , it does almost vanish in the case of @xmath74 ev @xcite .",

    "( ii ) spin - phonon coupling _ , _ ( iii ) two - magnon / triplon plus phonon absorption _ and _ ( iv ) triple resonance _ are necessary in order to describe the high - energy spectral weight .",
    "most of the publications deal with the two - dimensional compounds . here",
    "we will try to review these ideas and reexamine them in the light of our new results .",
    "especially the quantitative results for the cuprate ladders can give new insights in this discussion .    _ ( i ) multi - particle contributions _ one open problem is the role of multi - particle contributions to the raman response , i.e. the four - magnon contribution in the case of the square lattice and the four - triplon contribution in the case of the two - leg ladder . at this stage",
    "no quantitative calculations are available .",
    "but it is known that the multi - triplon spectral weights are sizable for the two - leg ladder@xcite .",
    "the main effect of the four - spin interaction on the high - energy spectral weight is a small shift from the two - triplon to the multi - triplon channels@xcite .",
    "but this shift is not sufficient to account for the high - energy spectral weight as observed in experiments .",
    "this was also found in treatments for the two - dimensional square lattice@xcite .",
    "however , the complete magnetic infrared absorption spectrum ( including the high - energy part ) of la6ca8 can be described quantitatively by including multi - particle contributions@xcite . here",
    "@xmath81 does not play the dominant role for the high - energy spectral weight@xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible that these contributions give a noticeable effect also on the high - energy raman response .",
    "there are also indications that the spectral weight can not be fully explained in this way .",
    "for example , the four - magnon spectral weight was shown to be negligible for the 2d square lattice@xcite .",
    "but the magnon - magnon interaction which was not treated in this calculation could enhance the high - energy spectral weight . also quantum monte carlo calculations which include all magnon contributions for the two - dimensional heisenberg model seem to explain only a part of the high - energy spectral weight@xcite . but finite size effects and inaccuracies of the analytical continuation can lead to uncertainties in determining the high - energy spectral weight .    _",
    "( ii ) spin - phonon coupling _ the latter observations suggest that additional degrees of freedom are important .",
    "it was argued by several authors that the coupling to phonons produces a large amount of spectral weight above the two - triplon peak@xcite . in one approach the spin - phonon coupling modulates the magnetic exchange couplings with a gaussian distribution .",
    "another approach introduces a finite spin wave damping induced by the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "both scenarios produce a significantly broadened and asymmetric two - magnon peak as observed in experiments@xcite .    nevertheless , the consistency of a spin - phonon coupling as suggested above with experiments is not clear .",
    "the magnitude of this coupling has to be unrealistically large in order to describe infrared absorption data@xcite .",
    "additionally , it was pointed out by freitas and singh@xcite that the temperature - dependent correlation length and the spin dynamics which agree well with purely magnetic models does not leave room for such a coupling@xcite",
    ".    there are no investigations of the role of spin - phonon couplings for the case of the cuprate ladder systems .",
    "but the fwhm of the two - triplon peak can be quantitatively understood within a purely magnetic model as shown in sect .",
    "thus , we conclude that the spin - phonon coupling is not strong in the case of the cuprate ladder compounds .",
    "such a coupling leads to a broad two - triplon peak in the same way as for the two - dimensional case .",
    "this is a contradiction when considering the raman response and the infrared absorption of cuprate ladders simultaneously : on the one hand one needs a larger anisotropy between leg and rung coupling ( larger @xmath77 ) in order to sharpen the two - triplon peak in the raman response again ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fwhm ] ) but on the other hand one can not explain the infrared absorption with an substantially increased @xmath77@xcite .",
    "a strong spin - phonon coupling is therefore in contradiction with the results obtained for cuprate ladders .",
    "this can be also seen as an indication that the same holds true for the two - dimensional compounds@xcite .    _",
    "( iii ) two - magnon / triplon plus phonon absorption _ a third alternative explaining the high - energy spectral weight uses phonons as possible momentum sinks . here",
    "a strong spin - phonon coupling is not necessary .",
    "the idea is based on the work of lorenzana and sawatzky for infrared absorption@xcite .",
    "it is well accepted in the case of infrared absorption measurements on cuprate ladders@xcite and planes@xcite that the dominant processes are magnetic excitations which are assisted by phonons .",
    "it was realized by freitas and singh that similar processes could be important also for the raman response in cuprate planes@xcite . in an analogous fashion a two - triplon plus ( raman active ) phonon process for the raman response in cuprate ladders could be important .",
    "it can be used to transfer spectral weight above the two - triplon peak leading to an asymmetric line - shape .",
    "it is a difficult task to determine the relative strength of this process compared to the usual two - triplon scattering .    _",
    "( iv ) triple resonance _ additionally , the triple resonance was proposed to account for the high - energy spectral weight in the two - dimensional compounds@xcite . as already stated in sec .",
    "[ cp ] , the experimental spectra of the planes are taken in the resonant regime .",
    "it is known that the triple resonance scenario yields an additional peak above the two - magnon peak .",
    "its intensity depends significantly on the energy of the incident light in accordance with experiments@xcite . in principle , the same effect is also present in ladder compounds .",
    "but for the laser energy @xmath132=1.92 ev@xmath133 considered for sr123 and sr14 the triple resonance condition is not fulfilled .    due to the simplified model used for the 2d system no conclusion about the high - energy weight can be drawn from our results .",
    "because a large spin - phonon coupling and the triple resonance can be ruled out for the cuprate ladder systems , the observed high - energy spectral weight in the cuprate ladder compounds has to be explained most probably by the multi - triplon or two - triplon plus phonon contributions .",
    "the first part of this work deals with the theoretical understanding of non - resonant magnetic raman scattering on cuprate two - leg ladder compounds , namely sr123 , sr14 , and la6ca8 .",
    "therefore we applied a triplon - conserving cut on a microscopic spin - model which includes heisenberg couplings and additional four - spin interactions .",
    "we studied the two - triplon contribution to the non - resonant magnetic raman response .",
    "the dominating feature of the two - triplon contribution is the two - triplon peak which has a characteristic fwhm depending on the model parameters @xmath77 and @xmath81 .",
    "we carefully chose the experimental data closest to the non - resonant regime and compared them with our theory .",
    "the key observation we found is that the sharpness of the two - triplon peak in sr123 and sr14 in comparison to la6ca8 can be explained by the stronger anisotropy of the magnetic exchange along the rungs and legs of the ladder .",
    "indeed , the two - triplon peak width depends strongly on the parameter @xmath77 .",
    "both materials can be modeled with the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 but different global energy scales @xmath136 @xmath13 for sr123 and @xmath137 @xmath13 for sr14 .",
    "the parameters for sr14 are in good agreement with infrared absorption @xcite and inelastic neutron scattering@xcite experiments .",
    "we conclude that the dominating two - triplon peak of the magnetic raman response in cuprate ladders can be consistently explained within the microscopic model .",
    "the presence of a four - spin interaction of the order of @xmath138 can be viewed as a settled issue .    in the second part of this article we used the results found for the two - leg ladder to describe the magnetic raman response of the undoped two - dimensional cuprate compounds in b@xmath98 and a@xmath98 polarization .",
    "the contribution to the a@xmath98 polarization is only allowed for finite four - spin interactions due to symmetry reasons .",
    "we use an isotropic coupling @xmath28 and @xmath16 for the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "convincingly , we find quantitative agreement for the two - triplon peak position _ and _ the two - triplon peak width for several compounds . additionally , a sizable spectral weight is found in the a@xmath98 polarization consistent with experiments .",
    "we conclude that the processes dominating the magnetic raman response are short - ranged .",
    "the last part deals with the missing high - energy spectral weight above the dominating two - triplon peak for the case of cuprate ladders and planes .",
    "we review possible sources of this spectral weight like multi - particle contributions , the role of spin - phonon coupling , a two - triplon plus phonon process and the triple resonance to the magnetic raman response .",
    "we deduced from our results that the high - energy spectral weight can not be explained with realistic values for the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "in summary , our calculations lead to an unified understanding of the magnetic raman response in cuprate ladder compounds within a purely magnetic model .",
    "a strong spin - phonon coupling can be excluded for these materials .",
    "additionally , we obtained a convincing quantitative description of the dominating two - magnon peak in the raman response of cuprate planes using a toy model consisting of two uncoupled two - leg ladders .",
    "this suggests that the short - ranged triplon excitations might be an alternative starting point for the description of the two - dimensional cuprate compounds .",

    "<S> an unified picture for the raman response of magnetic excitations in cuprate spin - ladder compounds is obtained by comparing calculated two - triplon raman line - shapes with those of the prototypical compounds srcu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( sr123 ) , sr@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( sr14 ) , and la@xmath5ca@xmath6cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( la6ca8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical model for the two - leg ladder contains heisenberg exchange couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 plus an additional four - spin interaction @xmath9 . within this model sr123 and sr14 </S>",
    "<S> can be described by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings found for la6ca8 are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the unexpected sharp two - triplon peak in the ladder materials compared to the undoped two - dimensional cuprates can be traced back to the anisotropy of the magnetic exchange in rung and leg direction . with the results obtained for the isotropic ladder we calculate the raman line - shape of a two - dimensional square lattice using a toy model consisting of a vertical and a horizontal ladder . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison of these results with raman experiments for the two - dimensional cuprates r@xmath0cuo@xmath18 ( r = la , nd ) , sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 , and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath19 yields a good agreement for the dominating two - triplon peak . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that short range quantum fluctuations are dominating the magnetic raman response in both , ladders and planes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible scenarios responsible for the high - energy spectral weight of the raman line - shape , i.e. phonons , the triple - resonance and multi - particle contributions . </S>"
