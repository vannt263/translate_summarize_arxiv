    "there is considerable interest in determining whether jovian planets on wide orbits represents a continuum that extends to brown dwarf masses , or whether there is a strong cutoff in the number of companions as a function of mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this relates to possible formation pathways for substellar companions : either companions form within a circumstellar disk and reach a mass above the deuterium burning limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) or via cloud fragmentation , as in binary systems with a high mass ratio ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) .",
    "population statistics from direct imaging provide essential observational parameters to test formation history . from numerous surveys , only a handful of imaged substellar companions are @xmath11100 au from their host stars .",
    "in particular , this separation regime has shown a lack of brown dwarfs with @xmath12 ( the `` brown - dwarf desert '' , e.g. , @xcite ) around stars with m@xmath13m@xmath14 .",
    "however , this parameter space has recently begun to be populated by direct imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the contrast of a substellar object is more favorable for imaging with youth , direct imaging surveys tend to target sources with evidence of a relatively young age ( @xmath15 myr ) .",
    "the presence of a debris disk , leftover of planet formation , is an insight for a younger - than - field age since the dust luminosity is known to decrease with time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the dust can persist to longer time if small planetesimals are dynamically perturbed by orbiting companion , hence other youth indicators are necessary to constrain the age of a star .",
    "an accurate estimate of the age of the star is necessary since companion properties are often derived from evolutionary models .",
    "membership in nearby young associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides the tightest constraints on the age of a star ; otherwise , large variation in the derived companion masses exists ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among the brown dwarf - mass companions that have been discovered around stars with infrared excess , none",
    "have been previously seen inside the inner hole of a resolved disk , which offers the opportunity to study dynamical interactions . using the gemini planet imager ( gpi , @xcite ) , we report the discovery of a companion to the debris disk host hr 2562 .",
    "hr 2562b has a projected separation within the `` brown - dwarf desert '' , and within a possible cleared inner hole .",
    "we derive properties for this companion based on spectra and colors , and discuss the potential roll it plays in maintaining and shaping the debris disk .",

    "several groups have also computed metallicity estimates , which range from [ m / h ] = [ -0.05,+0.08 ] @xcite , with possible evidence for peculiar individual abundances @xcite .",
    "currently there are several disparate age estimates for hr 2562 in the literature .",
    "an estimate of 300@xmath0120 myr was made by @xcite , who used a combination of space motions and evolutionary model - derived ages to suggest that the source is part of a nearby local association subgroup called b3 . in their identification of the source using _ iras _ , @xcite use space motions , a lithium non - detection , and x - ray luminosity to give a rough age estimate of @xmath18300 myr .",
    "conversely , analysis of data from the geneva - copenhagen survey , in which metallicities and temperatures are used to derive ages from models , gives an estimated age of 0.9 - 1.6 gyr ( @xcite ) . in their assessment of age based on ca ii h and k lines , @xcite also derive an age of @xmath18900 myr .",
    "most recently , @xcite used photometric modeling with atmosphere models to derive an age range of 300@xmath19 myr .",
    "the banyan ii group / field membership estimation code @xcite gives low probabilities for the star to belong to any known young nearby group , but suggests the star is younger than field stars , giving a wide range of possible ages between @xmath1820 myr to @xmath181 gyr . while the age of the star remains uncertain , sufficient evidence of moderate youth led to the inclusion of hr 2562 in the sample for the gemini planet imager exoplanet survey ( gpies ) .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we adopt a nominal age range of 300900 myr .",

    "astrometric calibrator observations were obtained in january and february 2016 , and were analyzed as in @xcite .",
    "these observations showed no change in the ifs calibration as measured in previous gpies observations .",

    "further processing to suppress the star point spread function was performed as described in @xcite and @xcite , using four independent pipelines and several adi algorithms : cadi @xcite , tloci @xcite , and klip / pyklip @xcite .",
    "the post - processed cubes were then combined to create broad - band images , examples of which are shown in figure [ fig : images ] . from each of these pipelines",
    ", positions and contrast - per - slice and associated errors were extracted following the forward modeled and minimization techniques described in @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "final values for astrometry and contrasts for the companion are derived by averaging the results of each pipeline .",
    "table 1 gives the astrometry and photometry derived from each observation set .",

    "at the distance of hr 2562 , the projected separation of the companion is 20.3@xmath00.3 au ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we assessed whether the candidate companion is comoving with the star .",
    "we compared all relative astrometric measurements with the predictions of the location of an infinitely far background object .",
    "the companion being an infinitely far background object is ruled out to 5@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "additionally , as in @xcite , we estimate likely orbit tracks for bound objects .",
    "the results of this assessment are shown in figure [ fig : astrometry ] .",
    "the astrometry falls clearly in the realm of bound orbits , with a preferred range of semi - major axes of @xmath181542 au .",
    "archival hubble space telescope nicmos data from 2007 was found for hr 2562 ( pi rhee , i d 11157 ) .",
    "these data were processed as part of the archival legacy investigation of circumstellar debris disks ( alice , @xcite ) . although the contrast achieved in these images is insufficient to detect the companion at its present location , we searched for point sources at the location the companion would have been if it was a background object ( @xmath181.3 ) .",
    "no source is detected at this location .    as we demonstrate in section [ spec ] , the companion photometry and spectroscopy are inconsistent with an infinitely far background star . a more likely source of contamination might instead be a non - stationary foreground or slightly background l / t dwarf .",
    "following the methodology in @xcite , we determine the probability of finding a l5-t5 type object in the gpi field of view by combining l and t dwarf space densities and absolute magnitudes @xcite . we calculate a false alarm probability of 7@xmath33 within the gpi field of view for l5-t5 dwarfs .",
    "since the companion was found after observing 203 targets , the final false alarm probability is 1.4@xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the chance alignment of a non - stationary , unbound brown dwarf is unlikely and the bound status is more probable .",
    "photometric and spectral comparisons were made to assess the likely properties of hr 2562b .",
    "first , we used several libraries of spectra and routines to determine the best - matching spectral type for hr 2562b .",
    "we used the splat toolkit , which makes use of the spex prism library , to determine which spectral types match hr 2562b @xcite .",
    "we find that the best - matching source comparing all three spectral bands simultaneously is wise j174102.78 - 464225.5 ( wise 1741 - 4642 ) , a recently discovered peculiar l7@xmath02 type brown dwarf with an estimated age of 10 - 100 myr @xcite .",
    "classifying the hr 2562b using spectral standards in splat returns a spectral type of l7@xmath00.5 .    in a separate analysis , we used a @xmath35 goodness of fit test with data from the spex prism library supplemented by spectra from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 fits were produced by normalizing the empirical spectra to hr 2562b with a constant based on the flux and uncertainties of both spectra , following @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 values were then calculated between the empirical spectrum and hr 2562b and assessed as a function of spectral type . in this analysis , we considered all three bands simultaneously and separate fits to each of the bands individually .",
    "we find that sources with spectral types between l3.5 and t2 provide the best fits to the data , depending on the band .",
    "the best fit to the j - band is a t2 type object , while l3.5 and l4.5 sources best match @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the simultaneous fit to all bands returns the same best fit as splat , wise 1741 - 4642 .    in our analysis of @xmath35 as a function of spectral type",
    ", we find that while earlier spectral types are preferred at h and k , mid - to - late l types have nearly equivalent @xmath35 .",
    "we also find that two other young l / t transition objects , vhs j125601.92 - 125723.9b ( vhs 1256b , @xcite ) and pso j318.5338 - 22.8603 ( pso 318 , @xcite ) are reasonable matches to the spectra in individual bands .",
    "when considering the bands simultaneously , it is clear that the overall flux in each wavelength is not perfectly matched by any other object , including the best - fit wise 1741 - 4642 .",
    "however , brown dwarfs can have similar spectral features despite varying flux in different wavelength bands ( i.e. , a range of colors ) , as shown , for example , by @xcite and @xcite . to investigate this , @xcite created band - normalized templates from optically - classified field l0-l8 and l0@xmath36-l4@xmath36 objects and found that objects with a range of @xmath37 colors as large as 0.60 can match band - normalized templates with average @xmath380.9 .",

    "the existence of a companion interior to the disk provides the exciting possibility to independently constrain the properties of hr 2562 system . @xcite",
    "discuss the possibility of a self - stirring mechanism generating the resolved disk material for a source as old as hr 2562a . in this mechanism , secular perturbations from a companion generate enhanced collisions of smaller planetesimals , leading to the generation of dust at wide separations @xcite . using equation 6 in @xcite and assuming their nominal disk parameters , we find that a mass of only 13m@xmath9 would be required to generate collisions out to @xmath18187 au in 900 myr assuming an eccentricity of 0.01 . if we use 30 m@xmath47 for hr 2562b , we derive a crossing time of @xmath18385 myr , consistent with the lower end of our adopted age range .",

    "a more complicated question is whether the inner hole can also be used to place an upper limit on the mass of the companion .",
    "though @xcite derive an average inner radius of 38 @xmath0 20 au from _ herschel _ images , the uncertainty on this value is fairly large .",
    "@xcite also performed a separate sed fit to available photometry and derived an inner radius of 64 @xmath0 6 au .",

    "we find that the sed and image together are best reproduced using an inner radius of @xmath1875 au .",
    "this radius is consistent with upper end of the uncertainty range and sed fit of @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we use both an inner radius of 38 au and our derived value of 75 au to roughly determine whether mass constraints are possible .    using the dynamical stability criterion proposed by @xcite , we estimate the mass of the hr 2562b assuming it is responsible for clearing the inner hole and that it has an eccentricity of zero .",
    "we find that if the inner hole is 38 au , the upper limit on the mass of the companion is @xmath1820 m@xmath9 .",
    "the difference between an age of 300 myr and 900 myr is negligible given our other assumptions .",
    "if instead we use an inner radius of 75 au , the upper limit on the mass is @xmath180.24 m@xmath8 , well beyond the highest estimates from evolutionary models .",

    "future observations that constrain the orbital parameters of the companion and high resolution images of the disk will offer insight into the potential history of interaction between the bodies in this system and provide meaningful mass limits .",
