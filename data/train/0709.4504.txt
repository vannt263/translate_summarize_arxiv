    "ngc6881 displays in the optical a quadrupolar morphology consisting of two pairs of highly collimated bipolar lobes aligned along different directions @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence that the axis of the central ring or torus has precessed in the last stages of pn formation @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the emission of the molecular hydrogen is very different from this of the ionized material @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission in ngc6881 is detected mainly in the equatorial region and in wide hourglass bipolar lobes that are much more extended than the ionized bipolar lobes .",

    "moreover , the better spatial resolution , depth , and accurate background subtraction in the h@xmath3 image presented here and the invaluable information contained in the near - ir spectra have allowed us to obtain a more detailed view of the distribution and excitation of the molecular hydrogen in ngc6881 .",
    "both the images and spectra show that the outermost regions are h@xmath3-dominated , while the central region and ionized bipolar lobes are emitting predominantly through lines of ionized species .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in the composite picture shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "guided by this picture , we have defined four different regions of interest : the central region or core , the ionized bipolar lobes , the h@xmath3 hourglass bipolar lobes , and the extension of the northwest h@xmath3 lobe .",

    "the ionized lobes show both prominent br@xmath2 and h@xmath3 emission , although their spectrum is probably contaminated by this of the h@xmath3-dominated bipolar lobes .",
    "the h@xmath3 lobes share the same orientation than the ionized lobes , but are less collimated and display a distinct hourglass shape .",
    "the northern h@xmath3 lobe extends 5 times farther than the ionized lobes , but the southern h@xmath3 lobe has a reduced extension .",
    "this asymmetry suggests the interaction of the nebula with an inhomogeneous interstellar medium .",
    "intriguingly , the edge of the southern h@xmath3 lobe is coincident with the loop of ionized material seen in the [ n  ii ] image , thus suggesting that it is not a precessing collimated outflow , as proposed by @xcite , but the outer edge of the southern h@xmath3 lobe .",
    "the h@xmath3 10 s(1)/21 s(1 ) line ratio ( see tab .  [ tab:1 ] ) derived for the different regions implies shock excitation even in the innermost regions of ngc6881 .",

    ", in prep . )",
    "the very different morphologies of the ionized and molecular bipolar lobes of ngc6881 imply different bipolar ejections that most likely occurred at different times in the nebular evolution . while the direction of the bipolar ejection has only suffered small variations , especially at the very end of the nebular evolution @xcite , the degree of collimation",
    "has increased drastically .",
