    "the deconfining transition of qcd is the last phase transition which our universe has enjoyed in the past . to study the nature of this transition it is essential to include dynamical quarks . in this paper",
    "we study the phase structure of finite temperature lattice qcd with degenerate @xmath9 wilson quarks .",
    "our model has 4 parameters : @xmath9 ( the number of flavors ) , @xmath10 ( gauge coupling ) , @xmath11 ( hopping parameter ) and @xmath12 ( lattice size in the temporal direction ) . for @xmath1",
    " 8 we use a spatial @xmath13 lattice ( the lattice size 10 is doubled for hadrons ) , while for @xmath14 we use @xmath15 .",
    "the method of simulation is similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "= 6.5 cm      in a previous paper @xcite we studied the deconfining transition @xmath16 for the cases of @xmath2 and 6 on an @xmath1 lattice .",
    "[ fig : f2f3pdiag ] shows our result of the phase diagram for @xmath2 near the chiral limit @xmath17 .",
    "( the result for @xmath0 will be discussed later . )",
    "@xmath16 is identified by a sudden change in the behavior of physical observables such as plaquette and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath17 is determined by a linear extrapolation ( in @xmath19 ) of @xmath18 in the confining region on the lattice with the same @xmath12 .",
    "we find that @xmath12- ( as well as @xmath9- ) dependence of @xmath17 is small for @xmath20 compared with the difference of @xmath17 determined by @xmath18 and @xmath21 ; the difference is a result of the o(@xmath22 ) corrections concerning the chiral behavior of wilson fermions .",
    "the location of the crossing point @xmath23 is identified by monitoring @xmath24 , the number of cg iterations to invert the quark matrix , just on the @xmath17-line @xcite .",
    "this can be done because of an empirical law @xcite that @xmath24 becomes very large in the confining phase when we get close to @xmath17 , while @xmath24 remains small in the deconfining phase even at @xmath17",
    ".    the nature of the transition at @xmath23 can be studied by measuring observables on the @xmath17-line @xcite .",
    "we find that , when we decrease @xmath10 toward @xmath23 , @xmath18 decreases linearly and is consistent with zero at @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that the transition is continuous ( second order or crossover ) , in accord with the result of an universality argument by rajogopal and wilczek who predict the second order transition for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this result is in clear contrast with the case of @xmath3 where we find that @xmath18 is large near and above @xmath25 .",
    "we also find a two - state signal in the time development of @xmath24 and other observables at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the first order transition observed is again consistent with a prediction of an universality argument stating that the transition is of first order for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "= 6.5 cm = 6.5 cm",
    "because the effective @xmath9 at the deconfining transition temperature in the real world is between 2 and 3 , it is important to extend the study to the case of 3 flavors . performing simulations we find the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2f3pdiag ] . as expected , @xmath16 shifts to smaller @xmath10 with increasing @xmath9 from 2 to 3 . fig .",
    "[ fig : f3kc ] ( a ) is the result for @xmath18 on the @xmath17 line .",
    "we find that @xmath18 is large for @xmath28 .",
    "we also find a two - state signal at @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f3kc ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the deconfining transition is of first order for @xmath0 in the chiral limit , which is in accord with the prediction of universality by pisarski and wilczek @xcite .",
    "now let us consider the case of much larger @xmath9 .",
    "in our previous paper we have shown that , when @xmath30 , light quarks are not confining even in the strong coupling limit@xcite . extending the study to finite @xmath10",
    "we find the following phase structure for @xmath30@xcite : we have a @xmath12-independent deconfining transition line @xmath31 , which starts from a finite @xmath11 at @xmath32 and extends to larger @xmath10 . in addition , we have a @xmath12-dependent deconfining transition / crossover line @xmath16 , which reaches the @xmath31-line without crossing the @xmath17-line .    to understand this phase structure , let us recall the property of the perturbative @xmath10 function .",
    "asymptotic freedom is broken for @xmath33 because the first coefficient of the @xmath10 function becomes positive .",
    "we note that the second coefficient changes its sign for @xmath34 .",
    "this suggests the existence of an infrared fixed point ( irfp ) for @xmath35 ( @xmath36 up to 2-loop perturbation theory ) . with an irfp correlation functions",
    "scale with non - canonical powers at large distances and therefore there are no hadronic particles@xcite .",
    "our mc result @xcite implies that @xmath37 .",
    "= 6.4 cm = 6.4 cm      as an extension of the @xmath5 case , we study an @xmath4 qcd in the strong coupling limit .",
    "we note that the @xmath4 @xmath10-function has the same characteristics as @xmath5 except for that typical numbers for @xmath9 are generally smaller than those for @xmath5 : with @xmath4 , asymptotic freedom is lost when @xmath38 and 2-loop result for @xmath6 is 6 .",
    "this is natural because the confining force is weaker for @xmath4 .",
    "we may therefore expect that @xmath6 is smaller than the case of @xmath5 .    performing a simulation for @xmath39 and @xmath1",
    "we find that the deconfining transition appears at @xmath40  0.21 and that the chiral limit at @xmath41 is in the deconfining phase .",
    "decreasing @xmath9 gradually with fixing @xmath42 , we find that the chiral limit remains in the deconfining phase down to @xmath0 .",
    "when we further decrease @xmath9 to 2 , @xmath24 shows a rapid increase with the molecular - dynamics time and finally exceeds @xmath43 in clear contrast with small numbers of o(@xmath44 ) for @xmath27 .",
    "the chiral limit is therefore in the confining phase for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : su2kc ] shows our results for physical observables for @xmath42 . to study the @xmath12 dependence of the transition",
    ", we simulate on an @xmath45 lattice for the critical case of @xmath0 .",
    "the stability of the result confirms that the deconfining transition we observe is a bulk transition . according to our experience with @xmath5 qcd",
    ", we expect that these properties in the strong coupling limit hold also for small @xmath10 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath8 for @xmath4 qcd .",
    "we studied the phase structure of qcd with dynamical wilson quarks . extending our previous study",
    ", we found that the finite temperature deconfining transition for @xmath0 is of first order .",
    "we also studied an @xmath4 qcd and found that @xmath9-dependence of @xmath4 qcd is quite similar to that of @xmath5 , but now @xmath6 , above which confinement is lost for light quarks , is 3 instead of 7 for @xmath5 .",
    "we have studied the phase structure of qcd mainly on an @xmath1 lattice . to study the implication to the continuum limit , the system should be investigated also at larger @xmath10 on a larger lattice @xcite .",
    "we are extending our study in this direction .",
    "the simulations are performed with hitac s820/80 at kek and with qcdpax .",
