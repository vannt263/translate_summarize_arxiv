    "a similar effect occurs for the same reason if we consider multiple clouds along the line - of - sight .",

    "the constant densities assumed in these cloud models may also contribute to discrepancies with observations .",
    "for the @xmath60  @xmath8 model , hf is efficiently removed from the gas phase even at the edge of the cloud because the sticking coefficient is proportional to the gas density .",
    "dense clouds are expected to be surrounded by diffuse material though , where hf will remain in the gas phase .",
    "a line of sight probing a dense cloud with a diffuse envelope would contain an hf abundance dependent almost entirely on the size of the envelope , because little or no fluorine depletion occurs there . in this way , a cloud that consists predominantly of dense gas can still show an appreciable hf column density if it is surrounded by diffuse material .",

    "<S> all observed hf / h@xmath3 ratios are well below @xmath13 , the value predicted if nearly all gas - phase fluorine is in the form of hf . models of fluorine chemistry that account for depletion onto grains are able to reproduce the results toward hd  154368 , but not in the cold , dense gas toward afgl  2136  irs  1 and elias  29 . </S>",
