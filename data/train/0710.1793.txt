    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that reactions of exclusive vector meson photo- and electroproduction can be described in the framework of a regge - eikonal scheme ( the general regge - eikonal approach was developed in @xcite ) similar to that as for high - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "one of the distinctive features of the proposed model is the use of nonlinear parametrizations for regge trajectories in the diffraction region in which their qcd asymptotic behavior is taken into account explicitly .",
    "in essence , the behavior of regge trajectories at large transferred momenta is a fact of fundamental importance : qcd does not permit linear trajectories .",
    "hence , there emerges the problem of compatibility of nonlinearity of regge trajectories following from qcd with available set of experimental data .",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite and applied in this paper partially solves this problem since in the framework of our approach phenomenological regge trajectories in the diffraction region satisfy the qcd asymptotic relations explicitly .",
    "the detailed discussion of the fundamental properties of regge trajectories ( such as their essential nonlinearity in the euclidean domain ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we limit ourselves by substantiating several useful relations .",
    "our viewpoint ( by no means very original ) is based on the conviction that qcd is the fundamental theory of strong interaction .",
    "so , in the limit of large negative values of the argument ( equivalent to short distances ) the exchange by any reggeon must turn into exchange by some colour - singlet parton combination and the asymptotic behavior of regge poles corresponding to exchanges by definite parton combinations can be determined .",
    "for example , if some reggeon corresponds to exchange by the quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath6 reggeon , etc . ) in the range of the perturbative qcd validity we come to @xcite @xmath7 in the case of multigluon exchange one obtains @xcite @xmath8 and , in particular , for two - gluon exchange @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the qcd running coupling .",
    "besides , if we assume that @xmath11 increases slowly enough at @xmath12 ( for example , not faster than @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) so that the dispersion relations with not more than one subtraction take place , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17 we obtain @xmath18 it is usually assumed that for the true regge trajectories relations ( [ gerg ] ) are fulfilled @xcite .    in @xcite , it was demonstrated that taking into account physical restrictions ( [ meson ] ) , ( [ gluon ] ) , ( [ gerg ] ) allows us to describe the diffractive pattern of high - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering in the framework of the minimal phenomenological regge - eikonal model with only three ( nonlinear ) regge trajectories ( soft pomeron and two secondary reggeons ) .",
    "behavior is so much important for diffractive scattering which occurs mainly at quite small transferred momenta .",
    "is nt it more economical to deal with much more simple and convenient in many respects linear approximation @xmath19 ? in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that such an approximation is valid only in quite a narrow interval of @xmath20 ( e.g. @xmath21 for high - energy @xmath22 scattering ) . ]    below we will show that such an approach also allows us to describe available data on high - energy ( @xmath23 ) exclusive vector meson photo- and electroproduction in the framework of the similar model , using only two @xmath5-even vacuum regge trajectories , namely , soft and hard pomerons ( here we follow the pattern of donnachie and landshoff @xcite ) .",
    "the soft pomeron trajectory is the same as for the diffractive nucleon - nucleon scattering ( in accordance with the requirement of universality of regge trajectories ) and the hard pomeron trajectory , lying much higher than the soft one in the euclidean domain ( see fig . [ trav ] ) , has the asymptotic behaviour ( [ hard ] ) ( in accordance with the fact that at high transfers the high - energy scattering amplitude is dominated by two - gluon exchange ) .",
    "the `` invisibility '' of the hard pomeron in the elastic diffraction may be explained by the fact that at available energies its contribution to the on shell eikonal is suppressed by the soft pomeron due to the disparity in on shell residues @xmath24 ( subscripts `` @xmath25 '' and `` @xmath26 '' correspond to hard and soft ) in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "we will treat the processes of exclusive vector meson production from the standpoint of the vector - dominance model ( vdm ) @xcite in which the incoming photon fluctuates into a virtual vector meson which , in turn , scatters from the target proton . according to the so - called hypothesis of @xmath27-channel helicity conservation ( the adequacy of this approximation",
    "is confirmed by numerous experimental data on helicity effects @xcite ) the cross section of reaction @xmath28 is dominated by the nonflip helicity amplitude which can be represented in the form @xmath29 where the sum is taken over all neutral vector mesons .",
    "@xmath30 is the coefficient of vector dominance dependent on the type of vector meson @xmath31 , helicity @xmath32 and virtuality @xmath33 of the incoming photon .",
    "@xmath34 is the diffractive hadronic amplitude with regge - eikonal structure ( the applicability of the regge - eikonal approach to the hadronic reactions with off shell particles is grounded in @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that for small enough values of @xmath20 the diagonal coupling of vacuum reggeons to hadrons is much stronger than the off diagonal coupling ( for example , elastic proton - proton scattering has a considerably larger cross section than diffractive excitation of n(1470 ) in the proton - proton collisions ) .",
    "so , in the high - energy range ( @xmath23 ) where vacuum exchanges exceed the nonvacuum ones ( the main indication of such an exceeding is the manifest growth of integrated cross sections with the collision energy increase ) the so - called `` diagonal approximation '' of ( [ genvdm ] ) may be used @xmath35 ( conversely , for a consistent description of the data at @xmath36 the contribution from nonvacuum reggeons must be taken into account and approximation ( [ diavdm ] ) becomes invalid ) . here",
    "we must note that recent measurements by zeus collaboration @xcite did not reveal patent dependence on @xmath20 and @xmath37 of the ratio of differential cross sections for the cases of longitudinally and transversely polarized incoming photon and this is the reason why we have omitted the superscript @xmath32 for @xmath38 in ( [ diavdm ] ) .",
    "in other words , we presume that spin phenomena related to the dependence of @xmath38 on helicities of incoming and outgoing particles are much more fine effects than diffractive scattering itself and further deal only with quantities averaged over spin states .    according to ( [ diavdm ] ) and regge theory @xcite the pole contribution of any @xmath5-even reggeon @xmath39 to the amplitude @xmath40 has the form ( the use of the designation @xmath41 for the pole contribution is caused by the subsequent use of the regge - eikonal scheme ; see below ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the reggeon trajectory , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the reggeon form factors of participating particles .",
    "the vdm in its simplest form gives @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the vector meson mass , @xmath49 is the electromagnetic coupling , and @xmath50 is the width of the vector meson decay to the electron - positron pair .",
    "however , these relations contradict both the experimental data on @xmath33 dependence of the ratio @xmath51 @xcite and the dimensional counting rules @xcite according to which functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and , hence , @xmath54 must exhibit moderate ( nonpowerlike ) @xmath33 behavior .    to resolve this conflict we have to modify the vdm coefficients @xmath55 and thus @xmath56 @xmath57 where , for any virtual photon spin state @xmath32 , @xmath58 , and function @xmath59 exhibits nonsteep @xmath33 behavior .    further on",
    ", we will concentrate on the diffractive pattern ( @xmath20 dependence ) of exclusive vector meson production and its evolution with collision energy ( @xmath37 dependence ) . since the second factor in the right - hand side of ( [ diavdm ] )",
    "nearly does not depend on @xmath32 we may consider only cross sections averaged over helicities of external particles . the averaged pole contribution of a reggeon @xmath39 to the amplitude takes the form @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 in a well - known paper @xcite , it was argued that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the vector meson `` bare '' mass . at infinite values of @xmath65",
    "the usual form of the current - field relation takes place .",
    "an interesting feature of this variant is a possibility to extend the vdm applicability for arbitrarily high @xmath33 .",
    "we do not fix the concrete functional form of @xmath66 ( it does not help to determine @xmath33 behavior of @xmath67 because of the absence of detailed information on @xmath33 dependence of @xmath45 ) . according to the dimensional counting rules @xcite @xmath68 at high @xmath33 ( we point out that such a behavior implies the violation of bjorken scaling @xcite ) , so @xmath67 must exhibit slow evolution with @xmath33 .    after these general remarks we can proceed to construct the scattering amplitude .",
    "it is well known that for soft reactions such as elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering or light vector meson photoproduction the introduction of only one trajectory with intercept higher than unity is necessary ( the soft pomeron ) .",
    "but in the processes with a hard scale ( for example , photon virtuality or / and heavy vector meson mass ) the rise of the cross sections with the collision energy becomes noticeably faster than in the soft ones and so there emerges the question if there exists one or several extra reggeons lying higher than the soft pomeron but with entirely suppressed residue(s ) in the nonperturbative regime @xcite . residues for secondary trajectories ( @xmath6 reggeon etc . ) .",
    "the last circumstance looks too counter - intuitive and a hard pomeron seems inevitable . ]    below we will use the minimal phenomenological scheme based on the idea of donnachie and landshoff @xcite that only one extra reggeon with the intercept much higher than the soft pomeron s one is needed .",
    "the difference between our realization of this idea and the donnachie - landshoff model lies in a choice of the functional form of regge trajectories since the authors @xcite insist on the strict linearity of the trajectories while we use essentially nonlinear parametrizations with asymptotic behavior following from qcd ( cf .",
    "the footnote 2 ) .",
    "we assume that at collision energies @xmath23 we may neglect contributions from secondary reggeons . in this case",
    "the minimal vacuum exchange off shell eikonal ( the sum of one - reggeon - exchange amplitudes @xcite ) takes the form @xmath69",
    "@xmath70 @xmath71\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are regge trajectories of the soft and hard pomerons , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the soft pomeron form factors of outgoing vector meson and proton , and @xmath76 is the regge residue of the hard pomeron .",
    "factors @xmath77 and @xmath78 are absorbed into an overall hard residue @xmath79 since the hard pomeron gives no noticeable contribution to the eikonal of nucleon - nucleon scattering at accessible energies and so we can not separately fix the form factor @xmath78 from the data on high - energy proton-(anti)proton diffraction .",
    "the corresponding on - shell eikonal of elastic @xmath80 scattering is of the form : @xmath81 @xmath82    since regge trajectories are universal functions of one argument , i.e. depend neither on the type of the process in which the corresponding reggeons contribute nor on the virtualities of the incoming particles , we will use , for the description of exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons , the same phenomenological expressions for the soft pomeron trajectory and the corresponding form factor of the proton as we did for high - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite : @xmath83\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath84 ( the values of free parameters obtained by fitting the data on proton-(anti)proton angular distributions are represented in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    ".parameters for @xmath72 and @xmath75 obtained by fitting the data on proton-(anti)proton angular distributions . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     at last , after determining the hard pomeron trajectory we can describe the phenomenology of exclusive production of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for the case of photoproduction , @xmath85 , we can neglect the contribution from the hard pomeron .",
    "however , high quality of the data on integrated cross sections at nonzero @xmath33 does not allow us to do this for the deeply virtual electroproduction .",
    "besides , determination of @xmath20 slopes of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is quite a hard task because of little amount and rather poor - quality data on the electroproduction angular distributions .",
    "so , for an unambiguous description we put the values of these slopes at nonzero @xmath33 equal to those for @xmath2-photoproduction , i.e. @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the results of the fitting data are represented in table [ tab4 ] and figs .",
    "[ rho0][elarho ] .    at the end of this section",
    "we would like to emphasize that the main success of the used model consists in a satisfactory description of electroproduction of @xmath1 meson at @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ phi5 ] : 1 free parameter versus 35 points ) and photoproduction of @xmath2 meson ( figs .",
    "[ jps01 ] , [ jps02 ] , [ jps03 ] : 6 free parameters versus 114 points ) .",
    "all other sets of data at fixed @xmath33 do not , in fact , allow unambiguous verification of validity of our regge trajectories because of the insufficient amount of data on angular distributions ( the data on electroproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath2 do not even allow us to fit parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 unambiguously ) .",
    "two main features of our approach are the use of an eikonalized ( unitarized ) expression for the scattering amplitude and the exploitation of the essentially nonlinear parametrizations of regge trajectories with explicit qcd asymptotic behavior .",
    "although there exists a whole sea of papers devoted to the description of @xmath37 and @xmath33 evolution of integrated cross sections and structure functions , only few of them deal with diffractive pattern ( @xmath20 dependence ) of the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , angular distributions contain very valuable information about the geometry of the interaction region and so they are more important quantities than integrated cross sections and structure functions .",
    "the papers which deal with this subject can be conventionally sorted into two groups .",
    "the first group consists of the purely phenomenological works . in @xcite ,",
    "the so - called `` dipole pomeron model '' is used with the soft pomeron as a double regge pole with a square root threshold singularity . in @xcite , the model of dual amplitudes with mandelstam analyticity ( dama ) with a square root leading singularity",
    "is used for the description of the @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "these two approaches , in fact , do not imply the concrete functional dependence of regge trajectories ( the authors of these papers use nonlinear parametrizations for regge trajectories ) and so are not in contradiction of principle with the requirement for reggeons to have a qcd asymptotic behavior . in @xcite , the usual born approximation for the scattering amplitude is used with postulated strictly linear regge trajectories .",
    "we do not share this point of view since we consider the consistency with qcd ( which implies nonlinearity ) more important than quite an arbitrary hypothesis about strict linearity .",
    "the second group consists of two papers @xcite exploiting the `` colour dipole model '' with a main hypothesis that if the incoming photon is of high virtuality or the outgoing vector meson is of high mass then the photon fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair which scatters elastically off the proton and , at last , recombines into the vector meson .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that it allows us to get a concrete functional form of @xmath33 dependence for reggeon form factors in the perturbative region .",
    "hence , the only functional uncertainties in the scattering amplitudes is the on - shell reggeon form factors and regge trajectories .",
    "however , these functions must be the same as for the corresponding elastic scattering and , so , the concrete applications of the colour dipole approach to the vector meson electroproduction must be supplemented by the simultaneous description of the high - energy proton-(anti)proton diffractive scattering with the same regge trajectories and form factors of the proton .",
    "this has not been done in @xcite . nevertheless , the colour dipole approach is still the only existing method for the quantitative estimation of the @xmath33 evolution of the off shell reggeon form factors . by no means",
    "is it in contradiction with the phenomenological approach used in our paper ( the colour dipole model allows us to determine the @xmath33 dependence while the regge - eikonal model allows us to determine @xmath37 and @xmath20 dependence ) and a synthesis of these two approaches seems promising for better understanding of the diffraction mechanism .    after obtaining the explicit @xmath33 dependence of the reggeon form factors in the framework of the colour dipole approach the verification of the proposed minimal regge - eikonal model",
    "will become possible not only by fitting to the hera data at separate values of @xmath33 but also by the simultaneous fit to the whole massive of hera data on @xmath93 and integrated cross sections .",
    "moreover , the model will be useful for predictions of cross sections of the exclusive vector meson photo- and electroproduction in proton-(anti)proton collisions at rhic , tevatron , and cern lhc energies @xcite ( the absorptive corrections due to the soft pomeron exchanges between incoming and between outgoing nucleons may be obtained automatically since we know the soft pomeron trajectory and the corresponding form factor of the nucleon ) .",
    "now we can summarize the results of our analysis .",
    "the successful simultaneous description of the data on elastic proton-(anti)proton scattering @xcite and the data on electroproduction of @xmath1 meson at low values of @xmath33 especially at @xmath90 in the framework of the one - pomeron model is the evidence that the soft pomeron absolutely dominates not only in the high - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering but also in the low @xmath33 electroproduction of light vector mesons at available energies .",
    "the results on the description of the high - quality data on integrated cross sections of @xmath0 electroproduction confirm that for electroproduction of light mesons at low @xmath33 ( about several @xmath94 ) the contribution of the hard pomeron to the eikonal ( born term ) is several times less than the soft pomeron s one .    the successful description of the @xmath2 photoproduction in the framework of a two - pomeron model with the hard pomeron that has the kirschner - lipatov asymptotic behavior @xcite in the deeply perturbative domain points to the fact that the hard pomeron has a perturbative nature ( contrary to the soft pomeron ) and dominates over the soft pomeron at high @xmath33 and high @xmath37 in accord with expectations of the parton model ( the smaller residue slope than the soft pomeron s one results in the domination of the hard pomeron also at larger @xmath20 ) .    among other things , we explicitly demonstrated that neglecting the contribution of regge cuts is not justified _ a priori _ and so in any phenomenological model the validity of the born approximation must be grounded by explicit estimation of absorptive corrections .",
    "also it was shown that when considering the processes of exclusive vector meson production there is no need to introduce the `` effective dependence '' of vacuum regge trajectories on the virtuality of the incoming photon ( this idea is very popular ; see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , such a dependence contradicts general principles since the true regge trajectories are universal analytical functions of one argument and do not depend on the properties of external particles ( such as virtuality ) .",
    "this hypothesis is disguised by the approximation @xmath95 which may be valid only in a limited kinematical domain .",
    "thus , it was shown that at collision energies higher than @xmath96 available data on exclusive diffractive reactions @xmath28 ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 , @xmath99 may be described in the framework of a simple phenomenological regge - eikonal model .",
    "this was achieved by using nonlinear regge trajectories in which their qcd asymptotic behavior was taken into account explicitly .",
    "we would like to point out that linear regge trajectories not only are in contradiction with qcd but even a satisfactory phenomenological description of the available data on @xmath20 dependence of exclusive production of vector mesons has not been attained yet within approaches using linear trajectories ( other phenomenological models with @xmath33-independent regge trajectories and acceptable value of @xmath100dof @xcite , @xcite also use nonlinear approximations to them ) .",
