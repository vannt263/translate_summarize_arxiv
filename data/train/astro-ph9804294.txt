    "lithium , together with d and @xmath10 , is one of the few elements produced by nuclear reactions in the first minutes after big bang ( wagoner , fowler & hoyle 1967 ) .",
    "the observations of these elements and their extrapolation to the primordial values are consistent with the predictions of the standard primordial nucleosynthesis providing , together with the relic radiation and the expansion of the universe , a robust support to the big bang theory .",
    "recently , additional support to the primordial nature of li in halo dwarfs has come from the observations of li in metal - poor stars of the thick disc ( molaro , bonifacio & pasquini 1997 ) .",
    "this population is chemically and kinematically distinct from the halo , but has the same li abundance of the halo .",
    "minniti et al ( 1997 ) claimed detection of li , at the plateau level , in a metal - rich , but old star , belonging to the galactic bulge .",
    "finally li at the plateau level has also been detected in a star which was possibly born in an external galaxy and then accreted by the milky way ( molaro 1997 ) .",
    "so far the li abundance has been always obtained only from the analysis of the li i @xmath11 6707    resonance doublet .",
    "this is not a very comfortable situation in the light of the importance of the determination of lithium abundances in stars for primordial nucleosynthesis , stellar structure and chemical evolution .",
    "our ability to determine the li abundance using simple plane - parallel homogeneous atmospheres , has been recently debated ( kurucz 1995 ; kiselman 1997 ; gadun & pavlenko 1997 ) . the analysis of several lines , which sample different depths in the stellar atmosphere is crucial to test the correctness of the modelling .",
    "the one dimensional , homogeneous , static models which are currently employed may arise concern because they ignore the fine structure and hydrodynamic phenomena such as granulation which are seen on the sun .",
    "the li i @xmath11 6707   resonance transition is the only one readily available to spectroscopic observation .",
    "the strongest subordinate line at 6104    is much fainter and blended with fe i line and has been so far detected only in young t tauri stars ( hartigan et al 1989 ) and li - rich giants ( merchant 1967 , wallerstein & sneden 1982 ) , were li is more than about 1 dex more abundant owing to the galactic li production .    in this letter we report the detection of the li i @xmath11 6104   transition in the spectrum of the metal  poor star hd140283 .",
    "both this line and the resonance line are consistent with the computations made using a one dimensional , homogeneous model atmosphere , thus increasing our confidence that this model represents a satisfactory average of the complex fine structure expected in metal  poor stars .",
    "the use of li observed in halo dwarfs as an indicator of primordial abundance rests on the absence of any li depletion .",
    "depletion is predicted by non - standard models which take into account rotational mixing ( pinsonneault , deliyannis & demarque 1992 ) or diffusion ( vauclair & charbonnel 1995 ) , but these models predict a downturn of the hot side of the li plateau and considerable dispersion .",
    "it seems that neither the downturn nor the large dispersion is present in the observations , which suggests that diffusion or rotational mixing do not affect significantly the li observed at the stellar surface of metal  poor dwarfs .",
    "however , the downturn can be very small ( @xmath12 dex ) for the purely diffusive case and a suitable choice of the mixing length parameter ( @xmath13 , see deliyannis et al 1990 ) and the issue of intrinsic dispersion remains rather controversial with some positive claims .",
    "ryan et al ( 1996 ) identify a triplet of stars ( g064 - 012 , g064 - 037 , cd -33@xmath14 1173 ) with similar colors , but different li abundances by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "then there is the case of star bd+23 3912 which has a [ fe / h]@xmath15 to @xmath16 and a li abundance which is about 0.20 - 0.36 dex higher than the plateau ( rebolo et al 1988 , king et al 1996 ) .",
    "moreover boesgaard et al ( 1998 ) find differences of up to @xmath17 dex among seven subgiants of m92 but the same objects show other chemical peculiarities , namely [ mg / fe ] is 0.55 dex lower and [ na / fe ] is 0.76 dex larger than in hd140283 ( king et al 1998 ) .",
    "we observed hd140283 on august 10@xmath18 and 11@xmath18 1997 at la silla , chile , with the eso new technology telescope and the emmi spectrograph under sub - arc - second seeing conditions .",
    "the high incidence angle echelle grating ( tan @xmath19 ) and a projected slit width of @xmath20 , provided a resolution of @xmath21 61000 , as measured from the th lamp emission lines in the region around 6104  .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a standard way and then coadded yielding a s / n of @xmath8 360 .",
    "the coadded spectrum was normalized by fitting a spline through points determined by averaging the spectrum over continuum windows identified with spectrum synthesis .",
    "figure 1 shows the region around the lii @xmath22 , 6103.6    transition .",
    "the li i feature is clearly detected at 6103.6  , red - wards of the ca i 6102.723    line .",
    "the equivalent width of the feature is 1.8@xmath23 m   and the detection is at 6@xmath24 of confidence level .    in fig 1 and 2 the lii 6104   and the lii 6707   doublet",
    "are shown superimposed on synthetic spectra .",
    "the synthetic spectra were computed using the synthe code ( kurucz 1993 ) assuming a li abundance ( li / h)=1.4@xmath25 ( bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) , not derived from present data .",
    "the model atmosphere for hd 140283 is the same used in bonifacio & molaro ( 1997 ) and has parameters @xmath26 , log g = 3.35 , [ fe / h]=-2.5 , microturbulent velocity of @xmath27 .",
    "this iron abundance is close to the value derived by king et al ( 1998 ) who find [ fe / h]=-2.58 with an effective temperature ( @xmath28 ) close to ours .",
    "the synthetic spectra were broadened with a gaussian instrumental point spread function of 5 kms@xmath29 , derived from the th - ar lines , and then with a rotational profile of 4 kms@xmath29 , derived from the li i 6707    resonance line .",
    "the subordinate transition was synthesized as three lines , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths ( martin & wiese 1976 ) , marked in fig .",
    "1 as vertical bars , and @xmath33 values ( lindgrd & nielsen 1977 ) are : 6103.538  , 0.101 , 6103.649  , 0.361 , 6103.664  , -0.599 .",
    "the lii line forming regions lie in the upper part of the atmospheric convective zone where li is mostly ionized due to its low ionization potential .",
    "this is why the determination of precise li abundances requires accurate observations , accurate stellar effective temperature and an appropriate modeling of the atmosphere of a metal poor star .",
    "the model - atmospheres employed are one dimensional ( 1-d ) , with plane parallel geometry and ignore any inhomogeneity effect , such as granulation .",
    "qualitative computations , based on a two - stream model atmosphere , suggested that the abundance of li in halo dwarfs could be underestimated by as much as a factor of 10 ( kurucz 1995 ) , but more recent calculations based on 2-d ( gadun & pavlenko 1997 ) and 3-d ( kiselman 1997 ) atmospheric models show that effects of granulation on the lii lines are much less important .",
    "granulation effects in the atmosphere have a depth dependence and this should produce different effects in the resonance and subordinate doublets .",
    "as can be seen from figures 1 and 2 , the same li abundance reproduces satisfactorily both the 6104   and the 6707   doublets .",
    "the two transitions form at different depths in the stellar atmosphere : unit optical depth at wavelength 6707.761    is attained at @xmath34 , corresponding in our model to a local temperature of 5235 k , while at wavelength 6103.649    it is already attained at @xmath35 , or t=5915 k. the resonance line receives contributions from a more extended region than the subordinate line .",
    "unit optical depth at the wavelength at which the residual intensity is 0.999 , is attained at @xmath36 for the resonance line , but at @xmath37 for the subordinate line . thus the subordinate line samples deeper and hotter layers than the resonance line , as shown in fig .",
    "the lower level of the li 6104    transition is the upper level of the 6707 @xmath38   transition .",
    "our synthetic spectra are computed under the lte assumption and the consistency between the two lines implies a correct computation of the populations of the 2s , 2p and 3d levels .",
    "this is in agreement with the theoretical estimations which predict relatively small corrections for nlte effects in the li 6707   line ( carlsson et al 1994 ; pavlenko & magazz 1996 ) .",
    "thus the detection of a subordinate lii line , and its consistency with the abundance derived from the resonance 6707    doublet , provides support to the correctness of this li abundance .",
    "the consistency of the abundances based on the lii 6707    and 6104    transitions observed in hd 140283 supports the li abundances measured in the population ii stars , using 1-d model atmospheres , in the last decades .",
    "the new generation of large telescopes will allow to measure the li 6104   li i subordinate doublet in other much fainter population ii stars , thus permitting to verify this consistency on the grounds of a statistically significant sample , and ultimately achieve a more accurate measurement of the primordial li abundance .    among the light elements produced in the first minutes after the big bang , li is the only one which shows a non monotonic behaviour with @xmath6 , the so - called _ li - valley _ , which reflects the different nuclear reactions which synthesize li at different baryonic densities .",
    "the most recent measurement of the li primordial abundance is @xmath39 ( bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) , which is the mean value of 41 halo stars for which precise effective temperatures , determined by means of the infrared flux method ( alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger 1996 ) , were available .",
    "the systematic errors , which dominate the error budget , come from a possible offset of @xmath40 75 k in the zero point of the temperature scale of cool stars .",
    "this li abundance intercepts the primordial yields for two different values of @xmath6 , which unfortunately do not help in resolving the deuterium and helium controversies .",
    "each solution for @xmath6 obtained from li is consistent with either the high - deuterium / low - helium ( webb et al 1997 ; olive , steigman & skillman 1997 ) or the low - deuterium / high - helium ( burles & tytler 1998 ; izotov , thuan & lipovetsky 1997 ) .",
    "the lower @xmath6 requires considerable d destruction to match the presently observed abundance in the local interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "the higher @xmath6 value is also consistent with the low deuterium ( d / h @xmath41 ) derived from the 92 cm hyperfine transition emission towards the unprocessed galactic anti - center ( chengalur , braun & butler burton 1997 ) ."
