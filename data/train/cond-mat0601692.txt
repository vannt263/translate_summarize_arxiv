    "the concept of renormalized charge is of primary importance in the equilibrium statistical mechanics of colloids , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite .",
    "this concept is based on the assumption that , at a finite temperature , the electric potential induced by a `` guest '' ( say colloidal ) charged particle , immersed in an infinite electrolyte , exhibits , at large distances from this particle , basically the screening form given by the high - temperature linear debye - hckel ( dh ) theory . from the physical point of view , due to strong electrostatic interactions , the guest particle of bare electric charge @xmath2 attracts oppositely charged electrolyte particles ( counterions ) to its immediate vicinity , and this decorated object may be considered as a new entity of lower renormalized charge @xmath7 .",
    "the idea of renormalized charge was confirmed in the framework of the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) approach @xcite : there is a renormalized - charge prefactor , @xmath7 , to the usual yukawa decay which is different from the bare charge @xmath2 of the guest particle .",
    "an interesting point is that , as the absolute value of @xmath2 increases to infinity , the renormalized charge saturates monotonically at some finite value @xmath17 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the rigorous validity of the pb approach is restricted , under certain conditions making the nonlinear pb theory superior to the linear dh one @xcite , to a specific scaling regime of the infinite - temperature limit @xcite . to go beyond this mean - field description , one has to incorporate electrostatic correlations among the electrolyte particles , like it was done , e.g. , in refs . @xcite .",
    "such approaches always involve some plausible , but not rigorously justified , arguments and approximation schemes .",
    "another strategy is to concentrate on simplified models which keep the coulomb nature of particle interactions and simultaneously admit the exact solution .",
    "specific two - dimensional ( 2d ) coulomb systems with logarithmic pairwise interactions among charged constituents , where the electrolyte is modelled by an infinite symmetric coulomb gas , belong to such category of models .",
    "the 2d coulomb gas of @xmath0 unit pointlike charges is stable against the thermodynamic collapse of positive - negative pairs of charges at high enough temperatures , namely for @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the ( dimensionless ) inverse temperature . in this stability region , the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the coulomb gas is exactly solvable via an equivalence with the integrable ( 1 + 1)-dimensional sine - gordon theory ; for a short review , see ref .",
    "an extension of the exact treatment of the stable 2d coulomb gas to the presence of some _ pointlike _ guest charge(s ) was done in ref .",
    "the problem of one ( two ) guest charge(s ) immersed in the 2d coulomb plasma was shown to be related to the evaluation of one - point ( two - point ) expectation values of the exponential field in the equivalent sine - gordon model .",
    "based on recent progress in the latter topic , two main results were obtained .",
    "firstly , an explicit formula for the chemical potential of single guest charge @xmath2 was found in the guest - charge stability ( no collapse of @xmath2 with a unit plasma counterion ) region @xmath20 .",
    "secondly , the asymptotic large - distance behavior of an effective interaction between two guest charges @xmath2 and @xmath21 was derived . as a by - product of this result , considering that @xmath21 corresponds to either @xmath22 or @xmath23 charged coulomb - gas species , the concept of renormalized charge was confirmed and the explicit dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath19 and @xmath2 , valid rigorously in the whole stability range of @xmath24 , was established .",
    "for a fixed @xmath18 , the renormalized charge @xmath7 , considered as a function of , say positive , bare charge @xmath2 , exhibits a maximum at @xmath25 : this non - monotonic behavior resembles the one observed in the monte - carlo simulations of the salt - free ( only counterions are present ) colloidal cell model @xcite . at the stability border @xmath26",
    ", @xmath7 attains a finite value .",
    "this fact was an inspiration for a conjecture , referred to as `` regularization hypothesis '' , about the possibility of an analytic continuation of the formula for @xmath7 to the collapse region @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the validity of the regularization hypothesis was put in doubts by tllez @xcite who calculated in detail the formula for the renormalized charge within the 2d nonlinear pb theory .",
    "the pb approach describes correctly , under certain conditions @xcite , the scaling regime of limits @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the product @xmath11 being finite .",
    "as was expected , in the guest - charge stability region @xmath13 , the exact formula for @xmath7 @xcite , taken with @xmath9 , was reproduced .",
    "when @xmath28 , a hard core of radius @xmath29 , impenetrable for electrolyte particles , has to be attached to the guest charge @xmath2 in order to prevent its collapse with electrolyte counterions . for the determination of the renormalized charge in this regularized case , the connexion problem of the pb equation to relate the large - distance behavior of the induced electric potential with its short - distance expansion @xcite is of primary importance .",
    "the numerical pb results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath7 is always an increasing function of the bare @xmath2 , and saturates at a finite value as @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , when the dimensionless positive hard - core radius @xmath30 ( @xmath31 denotes the inverse debye length ) is very small , @xmath32 , the renormalized charge saturates at the value given by @xmath33 this is a manifestation of the manning - oosawa counterion condensation @xcite known in the theory of cylindrical polyelectrolytes .    the study of the renormalization charge within the nonlinear pb approach @xcite is trustworthy , however , there are two open problems .",
    "firstly , the rigorous validity of the pb theory was proved for 3d electrolytes in the presence of some _ continuous _ domains of _ external _ charge distributions @xcite .",
    "the hard - core interaction between the external guest charge and the coulomb - gas particles , which is so relevant in the questionable guest - charge collapse region @xmath28 , was not considered in kennedy s proof . the second problem , which is probably even more important , is related to the limit @xmath9 considered in the pb approach .",
    "this limit represents a very strong restriction which prevents one from seeing nontrivialities in the plot of @xmath7 versus @xmath2 appearing at a strictly finite ( nonzero ) @xmath19 , like the previously mentioned existence of the maximum extreme at the point @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the monotonic increase of @xmath12 as the function of @xmath11 to its saturation value , predicted by the pb theory , is certainly not true for a finite inverse temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the exact renormalized - charge treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite to the guest charge with a hard core of radius @xmath4 , which allows us to go beyond the stability border @xmath34 of the pointlike guest charge . by the spirit ,",
    "the applied method is similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite to include hard cores around charged species of the infinite 2d coulomb gas itself . in the limit @xmath32",
    ", i.e. , when the hard - core radius of the guest particle is much smaller than the mean interparticle distance of the coulomb - gas species , due to the counterion condensation in the extended region @xmath6 , the renormalized charge @xmath7 turns out to be a periodic function of the bare charge @xmath2 with period 1 .",
    "the renormalized charge therefore does not saturate at a specific finite value as @xmath8 , but oscillates between two extreme values .",
    "such behavior indicates that , for a strictly nonzero @xmath19 , the manning - oosawa counterion condensation phenomenon @xcite should be revisited . in the scaling pb regime ,",
    "one recovers correctly the standard results including the saturation formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the known exact information about the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the infinite 2d coulomb gas , including the complete thermodynamics and both short- and large - distance asymptotic behaviors of two - point correlation functions . in this section , we introduce the notation and present important formulas which are extensively used throughout the whole paper . section 3 deals with the chemical potential of the guest charge immersed in the 2d coulomb gas .",
    "the case of the pointlike guest charge is analyzed in section 3.1 , the inclusion of the hard - core region around the guest charge is the subject of section 3.2 .",
