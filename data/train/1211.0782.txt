    "interplay between current and magnetization is an essential issue underpinning the field of spintronics  @xcite , which consists of two reciprocal problems : control of current through magnetization with a known configuration , and its converse , _",
    "i.e. _ , control of magnetization dynamics via applied current . in ferromagnetic ( fm ) materials with slowly varying spin texture @xmath0 over space and time , these issues can be solved by assuming that conduction electron spins always follow the background texture profile , known as the adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic basis underlying adiabaticity is the strong exchange coupling @xmath1 between conduction electron spins and local magnetic moments , through which spin mistracking with the background causes large energy penalty and becomes highly unfavorable  @xcite .    under adiabatic approximation",
    ", the current  magnetization interaction is recast into an emergent electrodynamics , in which its reciprocal influence boils down to a simple electromagnetic problem .",
    "specifically , by diagonalizing the local exchange hamiltonian via local unitary transformation , fictitious electric and magnetic fields are generated into the orbital dynamics  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are spherical angles specifying the direction of @xmath5 . as a consequence",
    ", the influence of background texture is represented by an effective lorentz force @xmath6 exerted on conduction electrons , where @xmath7 denotes spin - up ( -down ) bands .",
    "the electric and magnetic components of the lorentz force are responsible for the spin motive force  @xcite and the topological hall effect ,  @xcite respectively . in turn",
    ", back - reaction of the lorentz force provides an interpretation to the current - induced spin torque exerted on magnetic texture .",
    "@xcite in a formal language , the adiabaticity induces an effective gauge interaction @xmath8 , where current @xmath9 acquires gauge charge according to @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the effective electromagnetic potential representing space - time dependence of the texture .",
    "variation over the current @xmath12 yields the effective lorentz force ; and varying over the magnetization @xmath13 produces the spin - transfer torque .",
    "thus the current - magnetization interaction is reciprocal .",
    "however , the above picture apparently fails in antiferromagnetic ( afm ) materials where neighboring magnetic moments are antiparallel .",
    "conduction electrons are not able to adjust spins with local moments that change orientation on atomic scale .",
    "nevertheless , the staggered order parameter @xmath14 can be slowly varying over space - time , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the alternating local moments and @xmath17 denotes their magnitudes .",
    "a natural question is whether a slowly varying staggered order still renders adiabatic dynamics of conduction electrons in some other sense .",
    "this is desired knowledge for studying spin transport in afm materials , especially the quest for current - magnetization interaction as that for fm materials .    in spite of recent theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite progress ,",
    "this problem has never been addressed .",
    "but , at the same time , afm materials are believed to be promising candidates for new thrusts of spintronics ,  @xcite partly due to their tiny anisotropy , robustness against external magnetic perturbations , and absence of demagnetization , which brings prevailing advantages for experimental control . in this paper",
    ", we develop the effective electron dynamics in a smooth afm texture by applying the non - abelian berry phase theory  @xcite on energy bands that are doubly degenerate .",
    "the physics of adiabaticity in afm materials is found to be an internal dynamics between degenerate bands which can be attributed to a su(2 ) berry curvature .",
    "when translating into spin dynamics , the adiabaticity no more indicates spin alignment with the background , but a totally new evolution principle [ eq .  ] . aside from spin dynamics , the orbital motion of conduction electrons",
    "is coupled to two different gauge fields : one leads to the non - abelian generalization of the effective lorentz force ; the other results in an anomalous velocity that is truly new and unique to afm systems . with comparisons to fm materials",
    ", this paper provides a general framework on how a given afm texture affects the dynamics of conduction electrons .",

    "the spin of a conduction electron couples to the local moments by the exchange interaction @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the spin operator of the conduction electron , and @xmath20 flips sign on neighboring @xmath21 and @xmath22 sublattice sites . in spite of antiparallel of neighboring moments ,",
    "the staggered order parameter @xmath14 usually varies slowly over space and time , and we can treat it as a continuous function @xmath23 .",
    "accordingly , the conduction electron is described by a nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian locally defined around @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hopping term with @xmath26 connecting nearest neighboring @xmath27 sites ( we set @xmath28 ) . in general @xmath29 can be negative , but we assume a positive @xmath29 throughout this paper .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the mistracking between @xmath78 and @xmath79 has nothing to do with any non - adiabatic process , but is entirely due to the non - abelian nature of the problem .",

    "[ fig : spinfootball ] ]    since @xmath85 and @xmath86 form local spin bases with quantization axis being @xmath23 , the isospin @xmath59 can be pictured as a vector in the local frame moving with @xmath87 . in appendix b",
    ", we have shown that in the particular gauge marked by @xmath88 ( see eq .  ) , @xmath89 where @xmath90 form local bases associated with the local order parameter @xmath23 ( fig .",

    "equation   indicates two important properties : ( 1 ) @xmath59 is coplanar with @xmath79 and @xmath78 , which is specific to the particular gauge @xmath88 ; ( 2 ) while the isospin vector is constrained on the unit sphere @xmath91 , the physical spin satisfies @xmath92 , which constrains the tip of @xmath78 on an prolate spheroid with semi - major axis being @xmath23 and semi - minor axis on its equator having length @xmath84 ( fig .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath59 will not be coplanar with @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "now , the physical picture of adiabatic spin evolution is clear : as the background order parameter @xmath23 moves slowly in space - time , the prolate spheroid moves with it .",
    "the motion of physical spin @xmath78 is a superposition of the relative motion on the spheroid and the motion of the spheroid itself . the overall motion of @xmath78 described by eq .",

    "associated with this geometric motion , a su(2 ) berry phase is accumulated by the electron wave function , which can be regarded as the ( non - abelian ) gauge flux of a t  hooft - polyakov monopole at the center of the unit sphere spanned by @xmath79 ( table  [ tab : comparison ] ) .    a further remark : it seems to be a surprise that the magnitude of @xmath78 varies on the spheroid since @xmath100 , but how can the physical spin have a nonconstant magnitude ?",
    "we answer this question by studying the _ reduced _ density matrix for the spin degree of freedom .",

    "now since @xmath104 , thus @xmath105 , and what follows is @xmath106 , which suggests that the electron is _ effectively _ in a mixed spin state .",
    "this can be attributed to the entanglement of spin and sublattice degrees of freedom , specifically , because @xmath95 , we are able to infer the spin projection along @xmath79 by measuring the probability difference on neighboring @xmath27 sites ( vice versa )",

    "the parameter @xmath114 plays a key role here : in the @xmath115 limit , @xmath116 vanishes thus from eqs .",
    "and   we get null results @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in the other limit where @xmath119 , the solution of eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath120 if initial condition is @xmath121 , and eq .   reduces to the fm lorentz force equation ,",
    "by which the system loses the manifest non - abelian feature and behaves as two decoupled fm sub - systems .",
    "it deserves attention that in real afm materials , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 sub - bands host majority carriers , but they are subject to effective lorentz forces of opposite directions , which may lead to non - trivial spin transport .",
    "furthermore , the real space dynamics governed by eq .   exhibits spin - orbit coupling through the anomalous velocity term @xmath122 .",
    "it is along the same direction as @xmath123 , so eq .   amounts to give a modified group velocity .",
    "we mention that this term is unique to afm textures and has nothing to do with the anomalous velocity studied in fm or quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "it originates from the @xmath124 curvature that joints real space with bz , the importance of which has been overlooked before . for better comparison ,",

    "while this is quite true in fm materials , its validity in afm materials awaits experimental verification . at extremely low temperatures ,",
    "spin - flip scattering is dominated by magnetic impurities which can be made negligibly small in clean samples . besides , spin - independent scattering processes ( _ e.g. _ , electron - phonon scattering ) do not destroy our essential conclusions if @xmath133 is understood as the drift velocity of carriers .",
    "we mention that afm spintronics is an emerging field where very little is known .",
    "while it shares some similarities with the established fm spintronics , it is not always correct to copy ideas from fm systems .",
    "the adiabatic electron dynamics studied in this paper is one example .",
    "first , consider a spiraling afm texture sandwiched by two ferromagnetic layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dw ] ) .",
    "this magnetic structure has been realized in co / femn / py trilayers in a recent experiment  @xcite , where the fm order of co layer is nearly fixed but that of py can be rotated by external magnetic field .",
    "the afm order is dragged into a spiral due to the exchange bias effect on the afm / fm interfaces .",
    "the layer thickness of femn is roughly @xmath134 and can be made even larger , which far exceeds the lattice constant thus adiabatic approximation is valid ; meanwhile , typical spin coherence length is larger than the layer thickness at low temperatures so that spin evolution is governed by eq .  .",

    "right : incoming electrons only enter the @xmath21 sub - band due to the upper fm polarizer , the out - going electrons partially occupy the @xmath22 sub - band depending on the value of @xmath84 . ]",
    "[ fig : dw ]    when an electron flows from top to bottom with applied current , the top fm layer polarizes its spin so that it enters the @xmath21 sub - band across the interface .",

    "this is a topological result that only depends on the initial and final directions of @xmath79 , but is _ independent _ of the texture s profile detail .",
    "when @xmath119 , @xmath139 reduces to @xmath140 , which means the electron spin follows @xmath79 and remains in the @xmath21 sub - band , thus it flows into the bottom fm layer with a lower resistance ; in the @xmath141 limit , @xmath139 vanishes and the electron completely evolves into the @xmath22 sub - band thus experiencing a higher resistance . for an arbitrary @xmath84 and an arbitrary total rotation of the spiral denoted by @xmath142 , the electron will partially evolve into the @xmath22 sub - band with the wave function @xmath143 , thus the total resistance is @xmath144 ,   \\label{eq : mr}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is the intrinsic resistance of the afm texture itself , which depends monotonously but not too much on @xmath142 .",

    "if @xmath142 is increased beyond @xmath140 , @xmath147 will reach a maximum at @xmath148 and then reduces .",
    "the resistance maximum , if observed , serves as an experimental verification of eq .  .",
    "moreover , measuring @xmath149 also enables us to find @xmath84 without calculating the band structure .",
    "we remark that the above results survive in the presence of diffusive processes so long as spin - flip scattering is ignored .",
    "the reason is that spin - independent scattering only deflects @xmath150-space orbit , whereas the @xmath78 dynamics is determined by the variation of @xmath79 that is blind to @xmath150 in one dimension .",

    "therefore , the actual orbit traversed by the tip is contained in the intersection of the two constraints . through some straightforward geometric analysis , we know that @xmath78 is bounded between the @xmath79 cone and an inner cone whose semiangle depends on @xmath84 .",

    "remarkably , the motion of @xmath78 falls into two topologically distinct classes separated by the critical condition @xmath157 in a real spin wave , @xmath153 is nearly zero , thus @xmath158 . for real materials ,",
    "we expect @xmath159 , thus from eq .",
    "we know that for a partially filled band , @xmath84 is always smaller than @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath161 phase is more realistic .",
    "in this paper , we find that a slowly varying afm texture renders adiabatic dynamics of conduction electrons , which are described by three coupled equations of motion [ eqs .  ] .",
    "quite different from the fm case , the adiabaticity in afm materials does not imply strict alignment between conduction electron spins and the profile of background texture .",
    "instead , the adiabatic spin evolution is a superposition of a motion following the background order plus a motion on a prolate spheroid attached to the local order , where the latter originates from internal dynamics between degenerate bands .",
    "the overall motion of the spin is still geometric ; it can be attributed to the accumulation of a su(2 ) non - abelian berry phase originating from the gauge flux of an effective t  hooft - polyakov monopole in the parameter space .",
    "the corresponding orbital dynamics shares some similarities with fm materials in that the @xmath150-space dynamics can be described by an effective lorentz force equation .",
    "however , two prominent differences in the orbital dynamics distinguish an afm system from its fm counterpart : first , the gauge charge is dynamical rather than constant , by which spin and orbital motions no longer separate ; second , the group velocity is renormalized by a spin - dependent anomalous velocity , which is quite different from what has been studied before .",
    "our theory lays the foundation for charge and spin transports in afm texture systems , which will be applied to real materials in the future .",
    "the validity of our theory needs to be tested experimentally since available data on afm spintronic materials are very rare .",
