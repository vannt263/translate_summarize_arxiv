    "the recent explosive interest in using ultracold atomic gases as an excellent platform for studying the dynamics of strongly correlated systems driven out - of - equilibrium by slow ( adiabatic ) or sudden ( quenched ) changes to system parameters @xcite has been fueled by the unprecedented ability to tune such system parameters , in particular the interatomic interaction @xcite , and early experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite explorations of nonequilibrium dynamics . at the forefront of such studies are questions regarding nonequilibrium states reached after quenching @xcite , whose observation hinges on the ability of many - body systems to maintain coherence on time scales much longer than the equilibration time of the particles in the systems .",
    "the main obstacle preventing cold toms , especially those with a large scattering length @xmath3 , from acquiring such a long coherence time is three - body recombination , in which two atoms in a trap form a diatomic molecule with a third atom escaping from the trap , causing losses .",
    "this poses less of a challenge in fermionic systems , thanks to the pauli exclusion principle which tends to suppress three - body recombination @xcite . as such , in fermi gases tuned across or close to the feshbach resonance , where @xmath3 goes to infinity",

    "the prospect of a well - defined unitary limit was brightened by experiments on dilute thermal bose gases @xcite . at unitarity , on purely dimensional grounds , both the three - body loss and the equilibration rates",
    "will be of the same order of magnitude as the fermi energy @xcite , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fermi momentum .",
    "it was unclear which dominates until recently when a jila  experiment on @xmath1rb by makotyn _",

    "this pleasant surprise opens the door to the possibility of exploring the rich physics underlying strongly interacting bose gases @xcite and has motivated , together with experimental works such as @xcite , a flurry of theoretical studies concerning quenched nonequilibrium dynamics @xcite .    of particular relevance here is a theoretical analysis of the jila  experiment by yin and radzihovsky @xcite who , in the spirit of bogoliubov mean - field theory , divided the bose gas at zero temperature into a quantum system of bogoliubov quasiparticles and a condensate of number density @xmath0 , which is treated as a dynamical mean field ( as opposed to a fixed constant as done by natu and mueller @xcite ) .",

    "what are the properties of such a steady state ?",
    "this stationary state is characterized by a time - independent condensate density and a steady but periodically changing momentum distribution of quasiparticles .",

    "v , we perform a detailed study of the condensate population dynamics at both short and long times .",
    "we apply a self - consistent perturbation theory , which we develop in the appendix , to quantify the short - time behavior of the adiabatic solution .",
    "we use the adiabatic theorem to explain why the @xmath2-induced interaction can significantly slow down the initial condensate dynamics so that @xmath13 approaches a finite number even when the bose gas is quenched to unitarity .    in sec .",
