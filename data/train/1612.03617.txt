    "in his approach to the weakly interacting bosons gas @xcite , bogoliubov s first step was eliminating from the @xmath0-bosons hamiltonian :    @xmath13     + all the interaction terms that couple bosons in the excited states .",
    "this is a first - order approximation in the ratio @xmath14 , between the number of particles outside and inside the free particle ground state , which yields the truncated canonic hamiltonian :    @xmath15}^{\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_1(k)}b^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}b_{\\mathbf{k}}+\\nonumber\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\ne0}\\widehat{u}(k)\\big[b^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}b^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}(\\:b_{\\mathbf{0}}\\:)^2+b_{\\mathbf{k}}b_{-\\mathbf{k}}(\\:b^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{0}}\\:)^2\\big]\\:,\\label{hc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + in the thermodynamic limiy ( tl ) . the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 create / destroy a spinless boson in the free - particle state @xmath18 and    @xmath19     + is the fourier transform of the _ repulsive _ interaction energy @xmath20 ( @xmath21 . the number operator @xmath22 refers to the bosons in the free particle ground state .",
    "overtilded symbols indicate operators , to avoid confusion with their ( non overtilded ) eigenvalues .",
    "bogoliubov s next step is reducing @xmath1 to a bi - linear form , which is realized in the tl , by assuming @xmath23 ( a c - number ) . this is what we call the second bogoliubov approximation ( sba ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is _ grand canonic _ :",
    "@xmath24\\:,\\label{hsba}\\ ] ]     + and does not conserve the total number of bosons @xmath25 .",
    "the canonic version of sba , denoted as bogoliubov canonic approximation ( bca ) , follows from assuming @xmath26 for the bosonic fock states @xcite , which yields the approximated hamiltonian :    @xmath27}^{\\epsilon_1(k)}\\beta^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}\\beta_{\\mathbf{k}}+\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{n}{2}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\ne0}\\widehat{u}(k)\\big[\\beta^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}\\beta^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}+\\beta_{\\mathbf{k}}\\beta_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\big]\\:,\\label{hbca}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + where new creation / annihilation operators are introduced :    @xmath28     + ensuring the conservation of the number @xmath0 of real bosons .",
    "note that @xmath29 and @xmath30 satisfy the bosonic commutation rules _ exactly _ @xcite .    since both hamiltonians @xmath31 and @xmath32 are bi - linear forms in bosonic creation / annihilation operators , it is possible to eliminate the interactions by a suitable bogoliubov transformation :    @xmath33    which leads to a _",

    "pseudoboson@xmath10(pb ) will be used to distinguish , respectively , between a ce displaying a genuine particle nature , from one that does not , as will be seen in what follows .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , since now on referred to as ( i ) , the present author has diagonalized the hamiltonian exactly , in the special subspace spanned by states with the same number @xmath34 of bosons in @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 bosons in @xmath38 :    @xmath39 being the real bosons vacuum ) .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues @xmath40 ( see , in particular , @xcite ) turn out to be _ twice as large as _ the bca energies @xmath41 reported in the current literature @xcite :    @xmath42}_{\\mathcal{e}_s(k,0)}\\quad ( s=0,\\:1,\\:\\dots)\\:,\\ ] ]     + where :    @xmath43     + @xmath44 being defined in eq.n  .",
    "the exact eigenstates of @xmath1 calculated in ( i ) are , in turn , quite different from the bca eigenstates : the latter have total moment @xmath45 , corresponding to a number @xmath7 of qps , while the formers have _ zero _ total moment , for any @xmath7 . in this case , the eigenstate is formed by a sea@xmath10of opposite moment pairs , and @xmath7 numerates what we call the pseudobosons@xmath10 ( pbs ) carried by the eigenstate .",
    "hence a pb corresponds to the creation of a momentless quantum @xmath46 of energy , which can not be considered a particle in its full sense , but , rather , a sort of bosonic cooper pair .",
    "the next question is , thereby , which _ exact _ qps do follow from the diagonalization of @xmath1 .",
    "before entering the main subject , it should be recalled that in the present work the results are exact@xmath10 with respect to bogoliubov s approximations bca / sba , not with respect to the truncation of hamiltonian  , leading to @xmath1 ( eq.n  ) . as suggested in ( i ) , the exact qps - pseudobosons . ]",
    "should be expressed as linear combinations of states like :    @xmath47 bosons in @xmath35 , @xmath34 bosons in @xmath36 and @xmath48 bosons in @xmath38 , so that the total moment is , manifestly , @xmath49 .",
    "this actually means extending the diagonalization to the whole spectrum .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath1 can be written as a sum of independent one - moment hamiltonians    @xmath50     + where :    @xmath51+\\nonumber\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\widehat{u}(k)\\big[b^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}b^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}(\\:b_{\\mathbf{0}}\\:)^2+b_{\\mathbf{k}}b_{-\\mathbf{k}}(\\:b^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{0}}\\:)^2\\big]\\:.\\label{hc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + hence the whole problem can be reduced to the study of the exact eigenstates of @xmath52 , by solving the eigenvalue equation    @xmath53     + it should be clear that @xmath5 can be assumed non negative , without loss of generality , and represents the asymmetry in the excited states populations with opposite moment . thanks to a suitable transformation @xcite , eq.n   can be reduced to the same problem already solved _ analytically _ in ( i ) .",
    "this makes it possible to write the eigentates of @xmath54 ( eq.n  ) as :    @xmath55 ( necessary for normalizability ) and @xmath56 ( exclusion of negative populations ) .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath57 for @xmath58 , i.e. the pre - exponential factor in the probability amplitude on the fock states @xmath59 ( eq.n  ) tends to a polinomial of degree @xmath60 in @xmath58 .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 , the coefficients @xmath62 and the eigenvalue @xmath63 are determined by the following system of @xmath64 equations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath65-\\nonumber\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{m = n-1}^sc(m)\\binom{m}{n-1}(-1)^{n - m+1}=0\\:\\:(n=0,\\:1,\\:\\dots,\\:s+1)\\:,\\label{eq.c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + where @xmath66 by definition and the dependence on @xmath67 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 has been provisionally dropped .",
    "the energies are expressed in units of @xmath68 :    @xmath69     + the algebraic structure of the eigenvalue problem   is fairly peculiar : the two highest order equations ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) determine @xmath61 ( i.e. the exponential decay in @xmath34 ) and the eigenvalue @xmath72 , _ independently _ from @xmath73 and @xmath74 :    @xmath75     + @xmath76     + with all entries restored .",
    "notice that @xmath61 is negative and smaller than 1 in modulus , which ensure normalizability .",

    "those can be solved for the @xmath7 unknowns @xmath77 in terms of , say , @xmath78 , that will be determined by normalization .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting probability amplitude for the qp - vacua and for the ces carrying 1 qp , created from the 0-th , 1-st , 2-nd vacuum . since @xmath79 ( eq.n  ) , @xmath80 must be counted twice in the sum eq.n  .",
    "hence the energy eigenvalues of @xmath81 are :    [ es(k , eta ) ] @xmath82\\label{e(s , eta)0}\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\epsilon(k)\\left(\\eta+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+2\\epsilon(k)\\left(s+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-\\underbrace{\\left[\\epsilon_1(k)+\\frac{\\epsilon(k)}{2}\\right]}_{\\mathcal{e}_0(k)}\\label{e(s , eta)1}\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     +    ) .(a ) * : ces corresponding to qp - vacua ( @xmath83 ) , originated by creation of @xmath84 pbs ( bosonic cooper pairs ) . *",
    "( b ) * : ces corresponding to 1 qp ( @xmath85 ) , created from @xmath84-level vacuum.@xmath34 is the number of opposite moment pairs in the subspace spanned by the states @xmath86 * ( a ) * or @xmath87 * ( b ) * ( eq.n  ) .",
    "the collective excitation regime @xmath88 implies @xmath89.,width=384 ]    for the calculations in what follows , it is useful to recall that the coefficients @xmath90 in the bogoliubov transformation eq.n  , can be expressed in terms of @xmath91 ( eq.n  ) as follows :    @xmath92     + the limit of large @xmath93 , that marks the passage from collective to single - particle dynamics , yields @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "hence , from eq.n  , one has :    @xmath96     + since the ces ( qps and pbs ) become non interacting _ real _ bosons when their kinetic energy @xmath97 largely exceeds the interaction energy , the number @xmath60 corresponds to the total number of real bosons excited in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "this agrees with physical intuition : each pb corresponds to the creation of a sort of bosonic cooper pair , i.e. _ two _ bosons in @xmath99 , with opposite momenta and identical kinetic energy ; each qp corresponds to the additional activation of a _ single _ boson in @xmath35 .",
    "unlike some thermodynamic results @xcite , the differences between bogoliubov s _ dynamics _ and exact dynamics do not vanish in the tl . in bogoliubov",
    "s theory , the qps are obtained by repeated application of the creation operator @xmath100 ( eq.n  ) to a single vacuum state , and the integer eigenvalues of the number operator @xmath101 are assumed to be _ non degenerate _ , in as much as they represent the number of a single species of quasiparticles . as a consequence",
    ", the bca / sba spectrum corresponds to a _",
    "single , non degenerate _",
    "oscillator , with frequency @xmath102 ( recall @xmath41 , in eq.n  ) .",
    "in contrast , recalling eq.ns and , a lengthy but straightforward calculation leads to the following exact result :    @xmath103     + showing that : + ( a ) the @xmath104-th eigenvalue of @xmath101 is @xmath105-times _ degenerate _ , since @xmath106 includes both qps and pbs contributions .",
    "the exact energy spectrum is degenerate too , resulting from the sum of _ two _ independent oscillators ( eq.n  ) , one labeled by the non negative integer @xmath5 , with the same frequency @xmath107 as bca / sba , the other , labeled by the non negative integer @xmath7 , with doubled frequency @xmath108 . + by solving eq.ns   explicitly , it is possible to show that    @xmath109     + since in ( i ) it was shown that the lowest - order vacuum @xmath110 coincides with the vacuum of bogoliubov qps , equation   shows that bogoliubov qps coincide with the exact qps , in the absence of pbs ( @xmath12 ) . in this special case sba / bca lead to the exact ces @xmath111 ( eq.n  ) , corresponding to @xmath5 qps , each carrying a moment @xmath6 , with energy @xmath112 and velocity @xmath113 ( the sound velocity ) . in the limit of small @xmath88 , the sound velocity attains , in modulus , the constant value :    @xmath114     + however : + ( b ) the possible qp - vacua resulting from the exact diagonalization are all the eigenstates @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "they originate from the activation of @xmath7 momentless energy quanta @xmath117 , that we call pbs , and form an _ immobile _ sea@xmath10of opposite moment pairs , that we call the @xmath7-th vacuum ( fig .",
    "the exact eigenstates @xmath118 correspond to @xmath5 qps , each with finite moment @xmath6 , created from the @xmath7-th vacuum , as unpaired bosons producing an asymmetry in the opposite moment populations .",
    "+ hence : + ( c ) there are infinite different qps , originated by the @xmath7-vacua ( fig .",

    "those quasiparticles are totally ignored by bogoliubov s theory . in practice ,",
    "sba / bca exactly reproduce just the part of the whole spectrum corresponding to @xmath12 .    though the pbs",
    "_ alone _ can not be responsible for the dissipation processes @xmath120 _ la _",
    "landau  @xcite , since they have zero moment , they can influence the dynamics of the dissipation processes , by opening new emission / adsorption channels for the qps themselves .",

    "the well known conclusion , based on bca / sba , is that the particle can not dissipate its kinetic energy ( relative to the superfluid ) , unless @xmath123 ( eq.n  ) . taking the superfluid in the ground state ( @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath83 ) initially , the exact expressions yield :    [ e - pcons ] @xmath124     + from energy / moment conservation , with @xmath7 pbs and 1 qp in the final state of the superfluid . at small @xmath125",

    "expression adopts the 2nd quantization representation for the superfluid , and the co - ordinate ( @xmath135 ) representation for the scattering particle . unlike the simultaneous creation / annihilation of a _ single _ qp and @xmath7 pbs , it is easy to see that the creation / annhilation of 2 or more qps is a multiparticle process , forbidden at first order .",
