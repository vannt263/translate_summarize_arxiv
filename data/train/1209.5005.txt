    "<S> in fact , the vicinity of the dirac points typically lies outside the light cone . in order to overcome this momentum mismatch and observe the dirac plasmons </S>",
    "<S> , one might add an extra periodic modulation of the lattice to allow grating coupling between the incident light and the desired collective modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another alternative might be to use a non - linear technique to overcome the momentum mismatch @xcite .    in conclusion , we demonstrated the strong analogies between the physical properties of electrons in graphene and those of collective plasmon modes in a 2d honeycomb lattice of metallic nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the electronic states of graphene can be described by massless dirac fermions , the cp eigenstates correspond to massless dirac - like bosonic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the latter can be fully tuned by the polarization of an external light field , opening exciting new possibilities for controlling the propagation of electromagnetic radiation with subwavelength lateral confinement in plasmonic metamaterials .    </S>",
