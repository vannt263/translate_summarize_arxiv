    "inferences have been made for the existence of possible light echoes around a number of other sne , mostly from reemission of sn light by dust in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle to resolving the echo is that the sn host galaxies must be relatively nearby , although , even then , the structures can only be revealed by the superior angular resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .    the light echo of a sn results from the luminous ultraviolet ( uv)/optical pulse scattered by dust in the sn environment .",
    "we essentially see a reflection of the event itself @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the light echo is detected in the uv , we have a record of the bright , rapid flash of x - ray / uv emission emerging as the sn shock breaks through the massive envelope around the progenitor star @xcite , an event that is elusive on account of its promptness and brevity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "much of the circumstellar matter and small dust grains nearest to the sn will be destroyed by the pulse , although more distant , larger grains will survive .",
    "the observed light echo at a particular instant in time is the intersection of a dust sheet or filament with the ( virtual ) ellipsoid surface of constant arrival time , which results in nearly all cases as a circle or arc on the sky .",
    "we have discovered a resolved light echo around the normal sn ii - plateau ( ii - p ) 2012aw in the sb(r)b spiral host galaxy messier 95 ( m95 ; ngc  3351 ) , during the course of the legacy extragalactic uv survey ( legus ; go-13364 , pi : d.  calzetti ) .",
    "legus is a cycle 21 _ hst _ treasury program which imaged 50 nearby ( @xmath3 mpc ) galaxies in multiple bands with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) uvis channel and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide field channel .",

    "individual images of the echo are shown for all five bands in figure  [ figecho ] .",
    "the appearance of the echo is more of a circular patch , or blob , and less obviously a single ring .",
    "if the echo were a thin ring , though , its profile would be convolved with the wfc3/uvis psf and would not be sharply defined .",
    "it is also entirely possible that we are actually seeing multiple rings , such as was observed for the interstellar dust - scattered echo around sn 1987a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see his figure 1 ) , just not as well resolved .",
    "we know that the echo is a recent , post - sn apparition , since no evidence of it exists in the pre - explosion _ hst _ f555w and f814w images ( see @xcite , their figure 1 , and @xcite , their figure 2 )",
    ". using 20 fiducial stars in common between the pre - sn f814w image and the legus wfc3 f814w image in the immediate sn environment , we can precisely associate the position of the sn progenitor star with the bright spot seen within the echo in figure  [ figecho](e ) , with a rms uncertainty of @xmath25 ( in right ascension ) and @xmath26 ( in declination ) . there is little question that this is the sn itself , still prominently seen in f814w , relative to the fainter echo brightness .",
    "the sn is also apparent in f438w and f555w , but less so in f275w and f336w .",
    "a surface brightness enhancement to the southeast along the echo tends to dominate the echo s appearance from f555w blueward .",
    "this implies that the scattering dust is not uniformly distributed , which is consistent with the filamentary nature of interstellar dust and its subsequent effect on the structure of the observed light echoes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we performed aperture photometry within iraf of the entire light echo on the drizzled image mosaics in each band , through a range of apertures with increasing radii , in order to estimate the uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "a sky annulus was used to estimate the background , which was relatively low in each band .",
    "the vegamag zero points for an infinite aperture for the wfc3 bandpasses were adopted .",
    "we list our photometry for the echo in table  2 .",
    "the flux of the echo , @xmath27 , which is also listed in the table for each band , was established using these wfc3 zeropoints .",
    "we emphasize that the photometry of the echo in table  2 actually includes both the echo _ and _ the sn , particularly at the redder bands .",
    "to fully analyze the properties of the echo we needed to remove the sn flux from the total .",
    "this was the most complicated step in our analysis and involved significant uncertainty .",
    "we started with the three f814w exposures , since the sn was brightest relative to the echo in that band . even in f814w , though , the emission surrounding the sn is not necessarily spatially flat , so defining a sky background around the point source is nearly impossible .",
    "we searched for the location and flux of the sn point source with the understanding that the sn should be the sharpest feature in the image and the nebulous background should be relatively smooth . to this end , we extracted a 19@xmath2819-pixel raster about the target in each flc exposure .",
    "we then explored an array of positions and fluxes for the point source . for each trial position and flux , we subtracted the corresponding point - spread function ( psf ) from the raw exposures using a library psf tailored for the particular filter at the particular location in the detector .",
    "these library psfs were constructed from a well - dithered set of data taken of the globular cluster omega centauri soon after wfc3 was installed on - board _ hst _ ; they have proven to be good to better than @xmath292% .",
    "we then examined the residuals and identified the optimal location and flux for the sn to be the one that left the post - subtraction residuals as smooth as possible . to evaluate the smoothness of each residual image",
    ", we compared that image with a smoothed version of itself .",
    "the smoothed version is obtained by convolving the image with a 5@xmath285 quadratic smoothing kernel , which is equivalent to fitting for a six - parameter , two - dimensional quadratic centered on each pixel . in essence , this operation reduces the number of degrees - of - freedom by a factor of 25/6 .",
    "the image that was closest to its smoothed version was deemed to be the smoothest .",
    "the optimal location and flux of the point source was deemed to be the one that left the image as close as possible to the smooth version of itself .    using the above strategy",
    ", we determined a best - fit location and flux for the sn in each of the f814w flc exposures .",
    "when the positions were transformed into the reference frame , they agreed to within a rms uncertainty of 0.09 pixel in @xmath30 and 0.03 pixel in @xmath31 . using this best - fit position",
    ", we then found the flux of the point source in each f814w exposure that made the resulting image as smooth as possible and arrived at a flux of 650@xmath2375 e- for an exposure time of 359 s. the psfs were normalized to correspond to the flux within a 10-pixel aperture , so that is the effective aperture for these measured fluxes .",
    "we applied a similar approach to determine a best - fit flux for the sn in each of the other filters ( 850@xmath23150 e- in f555w , 400@xmath2345 e- in f438w , 50@xmath2375 e- in f336w , and 100@xmath2350 e- in f275w ) , using the master - frame position fit from the f814w exposures .",
    "we used the same psfs to measure fluxes for a number of other isolated point sources in the images , to tie this photometry to the vega magnitudes for stars in the images produced by dolphot @xcite .",
    "the sn flux was then similarly scaled in each band ; the resulting magnitudes are listed in table  2 .",
    "the uncertainties for the sn magnitudes in each band also include ( via quadrature sums ) the uncertainties in the scaling , although these are relatively small , compared to the uncertainties due to the smoothed model fitting . finally , we list in table  2 the resulting flux , @xmath32 , obtained from subtracting the sn flux from our aperture measurements of the echo flux",
    ". the fractional contribution of the sn light to the total echo flux is @xmath33% in f275w , @xmath34% in f336w , @xmath35% in f438w , @xmath36% in f555w , and @xmath37% at f814w .",
    "furthermore , we had @xmath38-supersampled and coadded the individual flc exposures in each band , with the sn flux removed , to produce images of just the light echo . in figure  [ figsuper ]",
    "we show the f275w , f438w , and f555w images summed together , in order to increase the overall signal - to - noise ratio of the fainter features of the echo .",
    "we did this primarily to reveal any ring - like structure .",

    "as pointed out , it is not clear from figure  [ figsuper ] that what we are seeing is a well - defined ring , with an expected central void indicating a lack of dust in the plane of the sn .",
    "we therefore can not exclude at this point that the sn is actually immersed in a diffuse dust cloud . nonetheless , we determined the radius of any ring - like structure by taking cross - cut flux profiles through the echo from its center , avoiding the bright surface brightness enhancement .",

    "the scattered flux @xmath72 at time @xmath73 from the echo at a given wavelength or bandpass is then    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the fluence of the sn at time @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the impulse response function , i.e. , the fraction of light scattered by the echo toward us , in units of inverse time , which depends on the nature of the dust and the echo geometry @xcite .",
    "the total sn light is treated as a short pulse over which the sn flux is constant , i.e. , @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the sn fluence is the integral of the light curves in each band with respect to time .",
    "the light curves that we considered here are the combination of those presented in @xcite and @xcite in @xmath79 , which approximately match what we see from the echo in f336w , f438w , f555w , and f814w , and the _ swift _ @xmath80 data from @xcite , where @xmath80 is the most similar _ swift _ bandpass to f275w .",

    "monitoring in @xmath81 began when the sn was at age @xmath2 2 days , while the @xmath82 and @xmath80 data commenced at @xmath2 4 days .",
    "of course , at the very earliest ages the sn light is dominated by the shock breakout , which is particularly important in the uv as a luminous flash . however ,",
    "the shock breakout was mostly not observed in the case of sn 2012aw .",
    "so , we have simulated what might have occurred , via shock breakout models , specifically , the analytical expressions for rsgs from @xcite and the hydrodynamical model for a @xmath83 rsg from @xcite .",

    "@xmath85 , and an explosion energy of @xmath86 erg , at the central wavelengths of the five bandpasses .",
    "the coefficients in the @xcite model have since been calibrated through numerical simulations of the explosion of an analytical star ( t.  shussman et al .",

    "here we are showing the curves in flux units , after reddening correction for an assumed total extinction , @xmath88 mag ( see below ) , assuming the @xcite reddening law with @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of the two models is relatively similar , although they exhibit notable differences during the first @xmath89 d after explosion .",
    "the post - explosion peak of the breakout in the uv is noticeably more pronounced in the @xcite model than in the @xcite model .",
    "the secondary peak at @xmath35 d in the @xcite  model is as luminous , if not somewhat more so , as the initial peak near @xmath90 d. the secondary peak emission for the @xcite model occurs earlier ( at @xmath91 d ) , and is more in line with the first observed datapoint , than for the @xcite  model .",
    "these secondary peaks and the declines thereafter undershoot ( for @xcite ) and overshoot ( for @xcite ) the observed uv light curve .",
    "we therefore truncate both model uv curves at @xmath92 d. the behavior of the model light curves , relative to the observations , is quite similar in the other bands , although the initial post - explosion flash diminishes in brightness toward the longer wavelengths .",
    "we merely needed to truncate the models before the first datapoint , as we did in the uv , to match the observations in the other bands .",
    "the fact that both sets of shock breakout models tend to agree quite well in flux with the early observed data , requiring very little adjustment , implies that the input parameters for those models , i.e. , the progenitor initial mass and sn explosion energy , are reasonable representations of sn 2012aw and its progenitor star .",

    "we note that @xcite estimated the extinction within the host galaxy , based on the equivalent widths of the na  i d features in a high - resolution spectrum of the sn near maximum light , to be @xmath152 mag ( see also @xcite ) , which is consistent with the implied extinction from the echo observations .",
    "the sn occurred in a region of m95 seemingly devoid of any recent massive star formation , so natal molecular gas and dust may have already dispersed some time ago .",
    "we find the close agreement in these estimates of @xmath150 to be sufficiently reassuring that our light echo models are reasonably correct . if we include the galactic foreground , the total extinction to sn 2012aw is @xmath88 mag .",
    "the echo model is certainly not perfect : we have only included models for the very early - time light curve behavior for the sn and do not know the exact nature of the shock breakout .",
    "we employed interpolated light curves in our computation of the sn fluences , since the observed photometric coverage in the five bands is not entirely complete .",
    "we also may have incorrectly estimated the sn contribution to the total echo light .",
    "possible faint positive residuals can still be seen in the sn - subtracted images of the echo .",
    "our estimate of the echo radius may well be incorrect .",
    "additionally , our assumed host galaxy distance may not be correct ; the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) list 21 cepheid - based distance moduli which span , to within their uncertainties , a range of about 2.7 mpc in distance , although the uncertainty - weighted mean of these distance modulus estimates , 29.95 mag , is within the uncertainties of our assumed distance modulus .",
    "if the echo radius were actually larger , implying @xmath146 would also be larger , then @xmath129 ( and , thus , @xmath150 ) would correspondingly also have to be larger ; the dust model itself would also change somewhat , as the scattering angle @xmath63 would be decreased . ( the reverse would be the case if the echo radius were smaller . )",
    "the overall agreement with @xmath150 obtained from the early - time sn spectrum would no longer hold , although it is conceivable that that estimate is in error .",
    "( @xcite estimated that the host extinction could be as high as @xmath1530.59 mag . ) furthermore , the echo - producing dust in m95 may not be as similar to milky way diffuse dust as we have assumed .",
    "all of these factors would result in increasing the uncertainty in our overall model .",
    "nonetheless , we have shown that , to within the uncertainties that we have estimated , we can fully and consistently account for the observed flux from the echo by assuming that the sn light has been scattered by diffuse interstellar dust .",
    "the echo light can actually be fit adequately enough without addition of the flash models , although the model flux in the uv is somewhat low .",
    "including the shock breakout flash , using either model , provides a superior representation of the observations in the blue and uv .",
    "we know that a flash must occur , so it is logical to have included these models with the observed light curves .",
    "all of the echo models tend to overpredict the flux slightly , relative to the observation , at @xmath106 .",
    "we have discovered in the legus multi - wavelength _ hst _ imaging a dust - scattered light echo around the sn ii - p 2012aw in m95 , at @xmath24 d after explosion .",
    "the superior _ hst _ angular resolution was essential ; at @xmath154 in diameter , observations from the ground under only truly exceptional conditions would have potentially partially resolved the echo .",
    "the echo was quite bright at the time , at @xmath292122 mag in each of the five wfc3/uvis bands .",
    "the echo is a result of the scattering of the total sn light from interstellar dust in the host galaxy , which we assume to have properties similar to milky way diffuse dust .",
    "in essence , the light echo is a complete record of the sn s luminosity evolution .",
    "we find from comparing a model of the echo to the observations that the amount of the dust extinction in the sn environment responsible for the echo is consistent with the value that was estimated from observations of the sn itself at early times .",
    "an independent means of constraining @xmath129 might come from x - ray observations of sn 2012aw : the sn was observed on 2012 april 11 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , and the data provide only a modest constraint , with the value of @xmath129 implied by the echo consistent with the limits allowed by the x - ray spectrum ( d.  pooley , private communication ) .",
    "the echo around sn 2012aw had become detectable in 2014 as the sn light had become sufficiently dim . under the assumption of a homogeneous thin dust sheet in front of the sn ,",
    "the light echo is always present and essentially constant in luminosity , even at maximum light , although the echo luminosity is typically @xmath155 mag fainter than the sn at maximum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if one reasonably assumes that at @xmath114 d the total luminosity is dominated by the echo , it is @xmath156 mag less luminous at @xmath102 than the sn at maximum light , which is roughly in line with the prediction for typical interstellar light echoes . from the approximations in (",
    "* his section 3 ) and adopting our estimates of the sn - sheet distance and the dust optical depth , one would obtain a sn - light echo contrast of @xmath36 mag .",
    "this assumes standard parameters for the dust and a homogeneous distribution within a thin dust sheet  the @xmath33 mag difference between the observed echo brightness and what is predicted could be explained by an inhomogeneous dust distribution , as apparently indicated by the asymmetric shape of the echo ( see figure  [ figsuper ] ) .",
    "one could conclude from the echo s appearance that there is more dust toward one side of the line - of - sight , so that the echo may also have increased in luminosity with time , as a result of increasing dust optical depth .",
    "furthermore , we find that , if our estimate of the sn brightness in the f814w band is correct at @xmath157 mag ( see table  2 ) , then the sn at the time was fainter than the observed brightness of the sn progenitor star in that band , 23.39 mag @xcite .",
    "we can not completely rule out that dust in the sn ejecta or immediate sn environment is at least partially responsible for the sn s faintness in 2014 .",
    "however , it was evident that any circumstellar dust in the progenitor envelope was destroyed by the x - ray / uv flash @xcite . adopting a sn expansion velocity of 3631 km s@xmath158 for sn 2012aw @xcite , after 2.1",
    "yr the sn would have already swept through @xmath159 , or @xmath160 au , most probably beyond the immediate circumstellar environment .",
    "additionally , analysis of _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "late - time data ( to be presented elsewhere ) shows that sn 2012aw was fading quite rapidly at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath161 m up to day @xmath162 , when emission from the sn in these bands was barely detectable .",
    "dust observed at these wavelengths would be relatively warm , and we can not discount that colder sn dust may be present .",
    "also , relatively small newly - condensed dust masses have been found for sne ii - p ( e.g. , @xcite ; although see , e.g. , @xcite in the case of sn 1987a ) .",
    "a more straightforward conclusion is that the progenitor star has vanished and that the rsg identified by @xcite and @xcite was almost certainly the progenitor of sn 2012aw .",
    "finally , the sn 2012aw light echo should be further monitored with _ hst _",
    ", particularly in the blue , to follow the evolution of its luminosity , as well as potentially to reveal new or evolving echo structures , and better constrain the nature of the echo geometry and of the scattering dust . continued observations will also place further constraints on the late - time sn brightness and disappearance of the progenitor .",
    "analysis of any future polarimetric imaging of the echo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would allow for an independent distance determination to the host galaxy , however , could be challenging , given the relatively compact nature of the sn 2012aw light echo .",
    "we are grateful for the comments provided by the expert referee , which significantly improved this paper .",
    "we appreciate helpful discussions we had with luc dessart and the generosities of both ehud nakar and nozomu tominaga .",
    "we also appreciate david pooley sharing his analysis of the _ chandra _ data on sn 2012aw in advance of publication .",
