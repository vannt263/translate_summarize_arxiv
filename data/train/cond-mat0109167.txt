    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots ( qd s ) @xcite are usually referred to as artificial atoms , a term suggestive of strong similarities between these manmade nanodevices and the physical behavior of natural atoms . as a result , in the last few years",
    ", an intensive theoretical effort [ 2@xmath113 ] has been devoted towards the elucidation of the appropriate analogies and/or differences .",
    "recently , we showed [ 10@xmath112 ] that in the absence of a magnetic field the most promising analogies are mainly found outside the confines of the central - field approximation underlying the independent - particle model ( ipm ) and the ensuing physical picture of electronic shells and the aufbau principle .",
    "indeed , as a result of the lower electronic densities in qd s , strong @xmath2 correlations can lead ( as a function of the ratio @xmath3 between the interelectron repulsion and the zero - point kinetic energy ) to a drastically different physical regime , where the electrons become localized , arranging themselves in concentric geometric shells and forming electron molecules ( referred to also as wigner molecules in analogy to wigner crystallization @xcite in infinite media ) . in this context , it was found @xcite that the proper analogy for the particular case of a @xmath4 qd is the collective - motion picture reminiscent of the fleeting and rather exotic phenomena of the doubly - excited natural helium atom , where the emergence of a `` floppy '' trimeric molecule ( consisting of the two localized electrons and the heavy @xmath5-particle nucleus ) has been well established @xcite .",
    "a natural extension [ 10,13,17@xmath123 ] of this theoretical effort has also developed in the direction of 2d qd molecules ( qdm s , often referred to as artificial molecules ) , aiming at elucidating the analogies and differences between such artificially fabricated @xcite molecular nanostrustures and the natural molecules .",
    "( depending on the arrangement of the individual dots , two classes of qdm s can be distinguished : lateral [ 10,13,17@xmath121,24 ] and vertical @xcite ones . )    in a previous paper @xcite and for the case of zero magnetic field ( field - free case ) , we addressed the interplay of coupling and dissociation in lateral qdm s .",
    "we showed that this interplay relates directly to the nature of the coupling in the artificial molecules , and in particular to the question whether such coupling can be described by the molecular orbital ( mo ) theory or the valence bond ( vb ) theory in analogy with the chemical bond in natural molecules .    a major attraction of qd s and qdm s is the fact that , due to their larger size , orbital magnetic effects become important for magnetic - field values easily attainable in the laboratory .",
    "this contrasts with the case of natural atoms and molecules for which magnetic fields of sufficient strength for the production of phenomena related to orbital magnetism are known to occur only in astrophysical environments , e.g. , on the surfaces of neutron stars @xcite . in this paper , we study the effect of orbital magnetism on the interdot coupling in a lateral , two - electron double quantum dot .",
    "this nanodevice represents an artificial analog to the natural hydrogen molecule and can be denoted as h@xmath6-qdm .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that it can function as the elemental two - qubit logic gate in quantum computing .",
    "we find that the interplay of the mo versus the vb description provides the proper framework for understanding the influence of orbital magnetism on the chemical bonding of the h@xmath6-qdm .",
    "in particular , we show that a perpendicular magnetic field reduces the coupling between the individual dots and , for sufficiently high values , it leads to the dissociation of the artificial molecule . as a result , in addition to the obvious parameters of interdot barrier height and interdot separation , the magnetic field supplies a third variable able to induce dissociation and thus to control the strength of the interdot coupling .",
    "our approach is twofold . as a first step , we utilize a self - consistent - field theory which can go beyond the mo approximation , namely the spin - and - space unrestricted hartree - fock ( ss - uhf ) , which was introduced by us @xcite for the description of the many - body problem of both single @xcite and molecular @xcite qd s .",
    "the equations used are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they are simply referred to as unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) ; the additional ss labeling employed by us emphasizes the range of possible symmetry unrestrictions in the solutions of these equations .",
    "in particular , the ss - uhf differs from the more familiar restricted hf ( rhf ) in two ways : ( i ) _ it relaxes the double - occupancy requirement _",
    "@xmath1 namely , it employs different spatial orbitals for the two different ( i.e. , the up and down ) spin directions [ thus the designation `` spin ( s ) unresricted '' ] , and ( ii ) _ it relaxes the requirement that the electron orbitals be constrained by the symmetry of the external confining field _ [ thus the designation `` space ( s ) unrestricted '' ] .",
    "since it is a general property @xcite of the hf equations to preserve at each iteration step the symmetries of the many - body hamiltonian ( whenever they happen to be present in the hf electron density ) , the input trial density at the initial step must be constructed in such a way as to _ a priori _ reflect the relaxation of the two requirements mentioned above . observe further that , in order to describe electron localization , the ss - uhf employs fully the fact that all @xmath7 ( where @xmath7 is the number of electrons ) orbital - dependent effective ( mean - field ) hf potentials can be different from each other .",
    "we remark that within the terminology adopted here , the simple designation hartree - fock ( hf ) in the literature most often refers to our restricted hf ( rhf ) , in particular in atomic physics and the physics of the homogeneous electron gas . in nuclear physics",
    ", however , the simple designation hf most often refers to a space ( s)-uhf .",
    "the simply designated unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) as used in chemistry ( e.g. , in calculations of open shell molecules ) corresponds most often to our s - uhf ( but not simultaneously space unrestricted hf ) .    as a second step",
    ", we will show that , in conjunction with lwdin s spin - projection technique @xcite , the solutions with broken space symmetry allowed in qdm s by the ss - uhf provide a natural vehicle for formulating a generalized valence bond ( gvb ) theory ( see below ) able to describe the chemical bonding in artificial molecules in both the case of an applied magnetic field and the field - free case .",
    "in the 2d two - center - oscillator ( tco ) , the single - particle levels associated with the confining potential of the artificial molecule are determined by the single - particle hamiltonian @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 for @xmath11 ( left ) and @xmath12 for @xmath13 ( right ) , and the @xmath14 s control the relative well - depth , thus allowing studies of hetero - qdm s .",

    "we limit ourselves to systems with @xmath23 .",
    "the most general shapes described by @xmath24 are two semiellipses connected by a smooth neck [ @xmath25 . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the centers of these semiellipses , @xmath28 is the interdot distance , and @xmath29 is the effective electron mass .    for the smooth neck , we use @xmath30 \\theta(|y|-|y_k|)$ ] , where @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the four constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be expressed via two parameters , as follows : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the barrier - control parameters @xmath39 are related to the actual ( controlable ) height of the bare barrier ( @xmath40 ) between the two qd s , and @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "the single - particle levels of @xmath44 including an external perpendicular magnetic field @xmath45 , are obtained by numerical diagonalization in a ( variable - with - separation ) basis consisting of the eigenstates of the auxiliary hamiltonian : @xmath46 this eigenvalue problem is separable in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. , the wave functions are written as @xmath47 .",

    "as we mentioned in the introduction , we will use the ss - uhf method for determining at a first level an approximate solution of the many - body problem specified by the hamiltonian ( [ mbh ] ) .",
    "the ss - uhf equations are solved in the pople - nesbet - roothaan formalism @xcite using the interdot - distance adjustable basis formed with the eigenfunctions @xmath68 of the tco defined in section 2 .    as we will explicitly illustrate in section 4.2 for the case of the h@xmath6-qdm , the next step in improving",
    "the ss - uhf solution involves the use of projection techniques in relation to the uhf single slater determinant .",
    "as an introductory example to the process of symmetry breaking in hf , we consider in this subsection the field - free ( @xmath69 ) case of h@xmath6-qdm with @xmath70 ( this value is an intermediate one to the three different values of @xmath64 that will be considered below in the case of an applied magnetic field ) .",
    "1 displays the rhf and ss - uhf results for the @xmath71 case ( singlet ) and for an interdot distance @xmath72 nm and an interdot barrier @xmath73 mev ( @xmath5 and @xmath74 denote up and down spins , respectively ) . in the rhf ( fig .",
    "1 , left ) , both the spin - up and spin - down electrons occupy the same bonding ( @xmath75 ) molecular orbital .",
    "in contrast , the ss - uhf results exhibit breaking of the spatial reflection symmetry ; namely , the spin - up electron occupies an optimized @xmath76 atomic - like orbital ( ao ) in the left qd , while the spin down electron occupies the corresponding @xmath77 ao in the right qd . concerning the total energies , the rhf yields @xmath78 mev , while the ss - uhf energy is @xmath79 representing a gain in energy of 0.85 mev .",
    "since the energy of the triplet is @xmath80 mev , the ss - uhf singlet conforms to the requirement @xcite that for two electrons at zero magnetic field the singlet is always the ground state ; on the other hand the rhf mo solution fails in this respect .      to make further progress",
    ", we utilize the spin projection technique to restore the broken symmetry of the ss - uhf determinant ( henceforth we will drop the prefix ss when referring to the ss - uhf determinant ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the @xmath76 ( left ) and @xmath77 ( right ) localized orbitals of the ss - uhf solution .",
    "an example of such orbitals for the field - free case are displayed in the right column of fig .  1 .",

    "@xmath102 in contrast to the single - determinantal wave functions of the rhf and ss - uhf methods , the projected many - body wave function ( [ prj0 ] ) is a linear superposition of two slater determinants , and thus represents a corrective step beyond the mean - field approximation .    expanding the determinants in eq .",

    "in addition this method fails explicitly ( it yields a triplet ground state at @xmath69 @xcite ) for small values of @xmath64 .",
    "our method is free of such limitations , since we employ here an interdot - distance adjustable basis ( see section 2 ) of at least 70 spatial tco molecular orbitals when solving for the ss - uhf ones .",
    "even with consideration of the symmetries , this amounts to calculating a large number of two - body coulomb matrix elements , of the order of @xmath112 .",

    "taking into account the normalization of the spatial part , we arrive at the following improved wave function for the singlet state exhibiting all the symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian ( here , the spatial reflection symmetry is automatically restored along with the spin symmetry ) , @xmath114 where the normalization constant is given by @xmath115 @xmath116 being the overlap integral of the @xmath82 and @xmath83 orbitals ( which are complex in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath117 ) , @xmath118    the total energy of the gvb state is given by @xmath119~ , \\label{engvb}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the single - particle part ( 1 ) of the total hamiltonian ( 3 ) , and @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the direct and exchange matrix elements associated with the @xmath2 repulsion @xmath123 . for comparison ,",
    "we give also here the corresponding expression for the total energy of the hf `` singlet '' ( i.e. , the spin - contaminated determinant with @xmath99 ) , either in the rhf ( @xmath124 ) or ss - uhf case , @xmath125    for the triplet with @xmath126 , the projected wave function coincides with the original hf determinant , so that the corresponding energies in all three approximation levels are equal , i.e. , @xmath127 .      in this section",
    ", we study in detail the behavior of the interdot coupling in the h@xmath6-qdm in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we present numerical results for three values of the dielectric constant , namely , @xmath128 ( @xmath2 repulsion much weaker than the case of gaas ) , @xmath129 ( @xmath2 repulsion weaker than the gaas case ) , and @xmath130 ( case of gaas ) .",
    "in particular we study the evolution of the energy difference , @xmath131 , between the singlet and the triplet states as a function of an increasing magnetic field varying from @xmath69 to @xmath132 t. the evolution of the two occupied ss - uhf orbitals of the singlet state is illustrated by plotting them at the two end values , @xmath69 and @xmath132 t. in all three figures ( i.e. , fig .  2 , fig .",
    "3 , and fig .  4 below ) , the lower half corresponds to a vanishing interdot barrier @xmath133 ( unified deformed dot at @xmath69 ) , while the upper half corresponds to a finite value of @xmath40 , being thus closer to the notion of a molecule proper .",
    "the interdot distance is chosen to be @xmath72 nm in all three cases .",
    "2 displays the evolution of @xmath134 as a function of the magnetic field for @xmath128 and for all three approximation levels , i.e. , the rhf ( mo theory , top solid line ) , the ss - uhf ( dashed line ) , and the gvb ( lower solid line ) .",
    "( the same convention for the @xmath135 curves is followed throughout this manuscript . )",
    "the case of @xmath133 is shown at the bottom panel , while the case of @xmath136 mev is displayed in the top panel .",
    "the insets display as a function of @xmath45 the overlap ( modulus square , @xmath137 ) of the two orbitals @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the singlet state . in this calculation , the effective @xmath20 factor was set equal to zero , @xmath138 , so that the gain of energy due to the zeeman effect does not obstruct for large @xmath45 the convergence of @xmath134 towards zero .",
    "due to its smallness relative to @xmath139 ( where @xmath140 is the cyclotron frequency ) , the actual zeeman contribution can simply be added to the result calculated for @xmath138 .",
    "we observe first that as a function of @xmath45 , for both the @xmath133 and the @xmath136 mev cases and for all three levels of approximation , the @xmath134 energy difference starts from a minimum negative value ( singlet ground state ) and progressively increases to zero ; after crossing the zero value , it remains positive ( triplet ground state ) .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath45 there is a sharp contrast in the behavior of the rhf curves compared to the ss - uhf and gvb ones . indeed after crossing the zero axis , the rhf curves incorrectly continue to rise sharply and very early they move outside the range of values plotted here ( at @xmath132 t , the rhf values are 0.93 and 1.21 mev for @xmath133 and 3.71 mev , respectively ) . in contrast , after reaching a broad maximum , the positive @xmath134 branches of both the ss - uhf and gvb curves converge to zero for sufficiently large values of @xmath45 .",
    "the convergence of the singlet and triplet total energies to the same value indicates that the h@xmath6-qdm dissociates as @xmath45 attains sufficiently large values .",
    "this is also reflected in the behavior of the overlaps ( see insets ) as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , the overlaps decrease practically to zero as a function of @xmath45 , suggesting that the two corresponding orbitals @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the singelt state tend to become strongly localized on the individual dots .    the molecular dissociation induced by the magnetic field and the associated electron localization",
    "is further demonstrated by an examination of the orbital densities ( modulus square ) themselves .",
    "these densities are plotted for both the end values of @xmath69 ( field - free case , middle column ) and @xmath132 t ( strong magnetic field , right column ) . for @xmath132 t",
    ", it is apparent that the plots portray orbitals well localized on the individual dots .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath69 the orbitals are clearly delocalized over the entire qdm . in particular , for @xmath69 and @xmath133 the two orbitals @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which are different in general , have collapsed to the same 1@xmath141-type distorted orbital associated with the single - particle picture of a unified deformed dot .",
    "one effect of choosing a very weak @xmath2 repulsion ( @xmath128 ) is that in the @xmath133 case the three levels of approximation collapse to the same mo value ( no symmetry breaking ) for magnetic fields below @xmath142 t , a fact that is also reflected in the orbitals themselves ( see the @xmath69 case in the middle column of the lower half of fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath136 mev , even such a weak @xmath2 repulsion does not suffice to inhibit symmetry breaking in the field - free case . as a result , for @xmath69 and @xmath136 mev , the two @xmath82 and @xmath83 orbitals ,",
    "although spread out over the entire molecule , are clearly different and the gvb singlet lies lower in energy than the corresponding mo value .",
    "a second observation is that both the ss - uhf and the gvb solutions describe the dissociation limit ( @xmath143 ) for sufficiently large @xmath45 rather well .",
    "in addition in both the ss - uhf and the gvb methods the singlet state at @xmath69 remains the ground state for all values of the interdot barrier . between the two singlets ,",
    "the gvb one is always the lowest , and as a result the gvb method presents an improvement over the ss - uhf method both at the level of symmetry preservation and the level of energetics .",
    "furthermore , whether a singlet or triplet , the gvb always results in a stabilization of the ground state ; the improved behavior of the gvb over the ss - uhf holds for all values of @xmath64 .",
    "we note that the failure of the mo ( rhf ) approximation to describe the dissociation process induced by the magnetic field is similar to its failure to describe dissociation of the molecule in the field - free case as a function of the interdot barrier and distance ( see ref.@xcite ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the underlying mo picture , the spin - density functional calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite also fail to describe the molecular dissociation process in the field - free case .. this dilemma has not been fully resolved todate ; several remedies ( like projection , ensembles , etc . )",
    "are being proposed , but none of them appears to be completely devoid of inconsistencies [ savin , a. in recent developments and applications of modern density functional theory , edited by seminario , j.m . ; elsevier : amsterdam , 1996 , p. 327",
    "in addition , due to the unphysical self - interaction error , the density - functional theory is more resistant against symmetry breaking [ see bauernschmitt , r. ; ahlrichs , r. j. chem . phys .",
    "1996 , 104 , 9047 ] than the ss - uhf , and thus it fails to describe a whole class of broken symmetries involving electron localization , e.g. , the formation at @xmath69 of wigner molecules in qd s ( see footnote 7 in ref .",

    "the influence of the magnetic field on the properties of the h@xmath6-qdm in the case of a stronger @xmath2 repulsion ( @xmath129 ) is described in fig .",
    "again we set @xmath138 for the same reasons as in the previous case ; the meaning of @xmath134 and of the displayed orbitals is the same as in fig .  2 .",
    "compared to the @xmath128 case , the increase of the @xmath2 repulsion is accompanied by an overall strengthening of symmetry breaking and electron localization , since there is no range of parameters for which the ss - uhf and gvb solutions collapse into the symmetry - adapted mo ( rhf ) one .",
    "indeed , even for @xmath133 the three levels of approximation provide different values for the singlet - triplet difference @xmath134 , with the gvb solution yielding in the field - free case the highest stabilization for the singlet . for @xmath136 mev ,",
    "the mo solution fails outright even in the field - free case for which it predicts a positive @xmath134 ( triplet ground state ) in violation of the theorem stating @xcite that the ground state of a 2@xmath0 system at @xmath69 is always a singlet .",
    "the overall strengthening of electron localization is also reflected in the behavior of the overlap integrals ( see insets ) , since now they start at @xmath69 with smaller values compared to the corresponding values of the @xmath128 case . in addition , the trend towards stronger electron localization with smaller @xmath64 can be further confirmed by an inspection of the orbitals of the singlet state displayed in the middle ( @xmath69 ) and right ( @xmath132 t ) columns of fig .",
    "compared to the corresponding orbitals in fig .  2 , this trend is obvious and we will not describe it in detail .",
    "it will suffice to stress only that , whatever the degree of initial electron localization at @xmath69 , the applied magnetic field enhances even further this localization , achieving again a practically complete dissociation of the artificial molecule at @xmath132 t.      the dielectric constant for a gaas heterointerface is @xmath130 , which corresponds to a further increase in the @xmath2 repulsion compared to the two previous cases of @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "this case is presented in fig .",

    "the results presented in fig .  4 confirm again the trend that electron localization becomes stronger the stronger the interelectron repulsion . as we found previously",
    ", the proper description of this strong electron localization requires consideration of symmetry breaking via the ss - uhf ( long dashed curve in the @xmath134 vs. @xmath45 plots ) and the subsequent construction of gvb wave functions via projection techniques ( solid curve in the @xmath134 vs. @xmath45 plots ) .",
    "the mo description is outright wrong , since the corresponding @xmath134 values are positive in the whole interval @xmath149 t ; in fact they are so large that the whole mo curves lie outside the plotted ranges in fig .  4 .",
    "for @xmath132 t , and in both the barrierless @xmath150 case and the case with an interdot barrier of @xmath151 mev , the artificial molecule has practically dissociated .",
    "compared to the previous cases of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the molecule starts with a stronger electron localization already in the field - free case and with increasing @xmath45 it moves much faster towards complete dissociation .      according to the gvb calculations ,",
    "the common trend that can be seen in all cases ( independent of the value of @xmath64 ) is that the singlet - triplet energy difference is initially negative ( singlet ground state ) in the field - free case . with increasing magnetic field",
    ", this energy difference becomes larger ( diminishes in absolute value ) , crosses the value of zero at a certain @xmath152 , and remains positive ( triplet ground state ) for all @xmath153 , converging from above to the straight line representing the zeeman contribution ( or to zero if the zeeman contribution is neglected ) .",
    "this means that for sufficiently large values of @xmath45 the singlet - triplet energy difference is given simply by the zeeman energy and that the molecule has practically dissociated .",
    "the trend towards dissociation is reached faster the stronger the @xmath2 repulsion .",
    "it is interesting to note again that for @xmath128 ( weaker @xmath2 repulsion ) the ss - uhf and gvb solutions collapse to the mo solution for values of the magnetic field smaller than @xmath154 mev .",
    "however , for the stronger @xmath2 repulsions ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) the ss - uhf and gvb solutions remain energetically well below the mo solution .",
    "since the separation considered here ( @xmath72 nm ) is a rather moderate one ( compared to the value @xmath155 nm at @xmath69 for the extent of the @xmath76 lowest orbital of an individual dot with @xmath156 mev ) , we conclude that there is a large range of materials parameters , interdot distances , and magnetic - field values for which the qdm s are weakly coupled and can not be described by the mo theory ; a similar conclusion was reached in ref .",

    "we have shown that , even in the presence of an applied magnetic field , the ss - uhf method , in conjunction with the companion step of the restoration of symmetries when such symmetries are broken , is able to describe the full range of couplings in a qdm , from the strong - coupling regime exhibiting delocalized molecular orbitals to the weak - coupling one associated with heitler - london - type combinations of atomic orbitals .",
    "the breaking of space symmetry within the ss - uhf method is necessary in order to properly describe the weak - coupling and dissociation regimes of qdm s .",
    "the breaking of the space symmetry produces optimized atomic - like orbitals localized on each individual dot .",
    "further improvement is achieved with the help of projection techniques which restore the broken symmetries and yield multideterminantal many - body wave functions .",
    "the method of the restoration of symmetry was explicitly illustrated for the case of the h@xmath6-qdm in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it led to the introduction of a generalized valence bond many - body wave function as the appropriate vehicle for the description of the weak - coupling and dissociation regimes of artificial molecules .",
    "additionally , we showed that the rhf , whose orbitals preserve the space symmetries and are delocalized over the whole molecule , is naturally associated with the molecular orbital theory . in a generalization of the field - free case of natural [ 36@xmath138 ] and artificial @xcite molecules",
    ", it was found that the rhf fails to describe the weak - coupling and dissociation regimes of qdm s in the presence of an applied magnetic field as well .",
