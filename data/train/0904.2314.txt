    "suspensions of dust , droplets , bubbles , and other finite - size particles advected by incompressible turbulent flows are commonly encountered in many natural phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "understanding their statistical properties is thus of primary importance . from a theoretical point of view , the problem is more complicated than in the case of fluid tracers , i.e.  point - like particles with the same density as the carrier fluid . indeed ,",
    "when the suspended particles have a finite size and a density ratio different from that of the fluid , they have inertia and do not follow exactly the flow . as a consequence , correlations between particle positions and structures of the underlying flow appear .",
    "it is for instance well known that heavy particles are expelled from vortical structures , while light particles tend to concentrate in their cores .",
    "this results in the formation of strong inhomogeneities in the particle spatial distribution , an effect often refered to as _ preferential concentration _",
    "( see @xcite ) . this phenomenon has gathered much attention , as it is revealed by the amount of recently published theoretical work ( @xcite ) , and numerical studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "progresses in the statistical characterization of particle aggregates have been achieved by studying particles evolving in stochastic flows by @xcite and in two - dimensional turbulent flows by @xcite . also , single trajectory statistics have been addressed both numerically and experimentally for small heavy particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and for large particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reader is refered to @xcite for a review .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with particle pair dispersion , that is with the statistics , as a function of time , of the separation distance @xmath6 between two inertial particles , labelled by the subscripts 1 and 2 ( see @xcite for recent studies on that problem ) . in homogeneous turbulence",
    ", it is sufficient to consider the statistics of the instantaneous separation of the positions of the two particles .",
    "these are organised in different families according to the values of their stokes number @xmath7 , and of their density mismatch with the fluid , @xmath8 .",
    "for our purposes , the motion of particle pairs , with given @xmath9 values and with initial separations inside a given spherical shell , @xmath10 $ ] is followed until particle separation reaches the large scale of the flow . with respect to the case of simple tracers , the time evolution of the inertial particle pair separation @xmath11 becomes a function not only of the initial distance @xmath12 , and of the reynolds number of the flow , but also of the inertia parameters @xmath9 .",
    "a key question that naturally arises is how to choose the initial spatial and velocity distributions of inertial pairs .",
    "indeed , it is known that heavy ( resp .",
    "light ) particles tend to concentrate preferentially in hyperbolic ( resp .",
    "elliptic ) regions of the advecting flow , with spatial correlation effects that may extend up to the inertial range of scales , as shown in @xcite .",
    "moreover , when inertia is high enough , the particle pair velocity difference , @xmath13 , may not go smoothly to zero when the particle separations decreases , a phenomenon connected to the formation of _ caustics _ , see @xcite . in our numerical simulations ,",
    "particles of different inertia are injected into the flow and let evolve until they reach a stationary statistics for both spatial and velocity distributions .",
    "only after this transient time , pairs of particles with fixed intial separation are selected and then followed in the spatial domain to study relative dispersion .    by reason of the previous considerations ,",
    "the main issue is to understand the role played by the spatial inhomogeneities of the inertial particle concentration field and by the presence of caustics on the pair separations , at changing the degree of inertia .",
    "we remark that these two effects can be treated as independent only in the limit of very small and very large inertia . in the former case ,",
    "particles tend to behave like tracers and move with the underlying fluid velocity : preferential concentration may affect only their separation . in the opposite limit , particles distribute almost homogeneously in the flow : however , due to their ballistic motion , they can reach nearby positions with very different velocities ( @xcite ) . in any other case of intermediate inertia ,",
    "both these effects are present and may play a role in the statistics of inertial pair separation .",
    "it is worth anticipating the two main results of this study : + ( _ i _ ) the separation between heavy particles can be described in terms of two time regimes : a first regime is dominated by inertia effects , and considerable deviations from the tracers case arise in the inertial relative dispersion ; in the second one , the tracers behaviour is recovered since inertia is weak and appears only in subdominant corrections that vanish as @xmath14 .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes defines a new characteristic spatial and temporal scale , connected to both the _ size of caustics _ and the stokes number , which influences the particle separation for not too long time - lags and not too large scale .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) the strong clustering properties that are typical of light particles may lead to the fact that many pairs do not separate at all : their statistical weight is clear in the separation probability density function ( pdf ) , which develops a well defined power - law left tail",
    ".    it would clearly be also interesting to investigate the dependence upon the reynolds number of the inertial particle pair separation .",
    "small - scale clustering seems to be poorly dependent on the degree of turbulence of the carrier flow ( @xcite ) , while much less is known about the reynolds number dependence of the caustics statistics .",
    "our numerical data do not allow to explore this question in detail , so that we will restrict ourselves to show data associated to the two reynolds numbers in all cases when differences are not significative .    in the case of fluid tracers ,",
    "the standard observables are the time evolutions of the mean square separation and of the separation probability density function , for which well established predictions exist since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "we contrast these observables obtained for tracers with the results for heavy and light inertial particles .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in  [ sec:0 ] , we briefly recall the basic equations of motion and describe the numerical simulations . in  [ sec:1 ] , we analyse the stationary distribution of heavy particle velocity differences , conditioned on the particle initial separation , highlighting both the presence of small - scale caustics and the effects of particle inertia at those scales corresponding to the inertial range of turbulence . in  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we study the behaviour of the mean separation distance of heavy pairs , at changing the stokes number @xmath7 ; we also analyse the influence of the caustics in the initial statistics on the subsequent pair separation evolution .",

    " distribution of particle velocity increments discussed in next section .",
    "turbulent pair dispersion for tracers is classically based on the application of similarity theory for eulerian velocity statistics : depending on the value of space and time scales , velocity increment statistics differently affect the way tracers separate .",
    "this results in different regimes for relative dispersion , see e.g. @xcite .    in the case of inertial particles ,",
    "the same reasoning holds , so that to analyse the way inertial pairs separate in time , the stationary statistics of particles velocity differences has to be investigated first .",
    "a stationary distribution for the typical velocity differences between two inertial particles is obtained by imposing periodic boundary conditions inside the physical volume and then measuring velocities on such a thermalised configuration .",
    "we are interested in the scaling behaviour of velocity increments at varying the degree of inertia and the distance between the particles ( in the dissipative or inertial range of the turbulent fluid flow ) .",
    "to fix the notation , we denote by @xmath55 the typical large - scale velocity of the fluid tracers and by @xmath56 the integral scale of the flow",
    ". moreover we define @xmath57 as the velocity difference at scale @xmath58 , conditioned on the presence of a pair of particles with stokes number @xmath7 , separated with a distance @xmath59 . since we are here interested in the case of heavy particles only , the stokes number is sufficient to identify a given particle family . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce a specific notation for the tracer stationary velocity statistics : @xmath60 , which is exactly equal to the eulerian velocity increment at scale @xmath58 .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that to describe inertial pair dispersion in synthetic flows it is useful to introduce the local or _ scale - dependent _ stokes number , using the ratio between the particle response time and the typical eddy turnover time @xmath61 of the underlying fluid at a given scale : @xmath62 . for real turbulent flow where different scaling ranges are present , we can equivalently define a scale dependent stokes number @xmath63 that recovers the usual definition of the stokes number @xmath64 when @xmath65 and behaves as @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",

    "we expect that two main features might be important in characterising the inertial particle stationary velocity statistics @xmath71 , with respect to that of tracers @xmath72 .",
    "the first concerns the small - scale behaviour of the particle velocity statistics . at small scales",
    "@xmath73 and for large - enough stokes numbers , the presence of caustics makes the particle velocity increments not differentiable .",
    "this feature can be accounted for by saying that @xmath74 where the @xmath75 is a constant prefactor and the function @xmath76 gives the typical scaling of caustic - like velocity increments .",
    "indeed we do expect that at changing the inertia of the particles , the statistical weight of caustics might monotonically vary as follows : at small @xmath7 , @xmath77 , i.e.  the value for smooth , differentiable eulerian statistics of tracers ; at large values @xmath78 , it should approach the discontinuous limit @xmath79 , valid for particles that do not feel underlying fluid fluctuations at all .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : stokes ] shows the typical shape of the function @xmath76 that is expected to be valid for turbulent flows .",
    "the second important feature concerns the particle velocity statistics at scales larger than the scale @xmath80 previously defined , but smaller than the integral scale of the fluid flow . for any fixed stokes number and for a large - enough reynolds number",
    ", we expect that inertia becomes weaker and weaker , by going to larger and larger scales @xmath81 .",
    "in such a case , particle velocity increments are expected to approach the underlying fluid velocity increments : @xmath82 where for simplicity we have neglected possible intermittent correction to the kolmogorov 1941 ( k41 ) scaling of the fluid velocity ( see @xcite for details ) . clearly , the reynolds number has to be sufficiently large to provide a well - developed scaling region @xmath83 , before approaching the large scale @xmath56 .",
    "we emphasise that in  ( [ def : vtou ] ) , an adimensional normalisation factor @xmath84 has been introduced : it takes into account possible filtering effects induced by inertia at large scales .",
    "the normalisation is such that @xmath85 , while for any stokes larger than zero @xmath86 .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig:1c ] we test the validity of the previous picture by analyzing the typical velocity fluctuation , @xmath87 , at changing stokes number and for data of run ii at reynolds number @xmath88 . at small scales",
    "one detect the presence of caustics in the velocity statistics , with a non smooth scaling behaviour below the kolmogorov scale @xmath20 . at scales within the inertial range and when",
    "the stokes number is sufficiently large , the effect of caustics affects also particle velocity statistics , up to a characteristic scale which becomes larger and larger by increasing particle inertia . beyond this scale ,",
    "particle velocity increments tend to approach the scaling behaviour of the fluid tracers , but their amplitude is depleted of a factor @xmath89 , which increases with the stokes number , as shown in the inset of the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1c ] .",
    "a similar behaviour is expected for higher order fluctuations , if we neglect the role of intermittency .",
    "it is interesting to consider the scaling behaviour of particle velocity in terms of the underlying velocity statistics , not only at very small or very large separations , but for any value of the scale @xmath58 .",
    "this is not straigthforward , since we have to account not only of the fluid eulerian statistics at the dissipative and inertial range of scales , but also the modifications due to the inertia .",
    "this is responsible , as we have seen , for the appeareance of a new relevant scale , and for filtering effects in the velocity amplitude .    to fully characterise particle velocity increments",
    ", we notice that the stokes scale , @xmath90 defines a typical _ stokes - velocity _ : this is the fluid velocity increment at the stokes scale , @xmath91 ( see left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : stokes ] ) .",
    "previous reasonings can be summarised in the following interpolation formula for the heavy particle velocity increment : @xmath92^ { \\left [      1-\\gamma(st(r))\\right]/2}\\,.\\ ] ] the above expression is a batchelor - like parametrisation but in the velocity space , with a transient velocity given by the stokes velocity , @xmath93 .",
    "once known the large scale normalization function @xmath84 , the caustic exponent @xmath94 ( introduced in @xcite ) and the reference fluid velocity increment @xmath72 , then the formula has one free parameter only .",

    "details of the small - scale caustic statistics will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the qualitative trend is very well captured by the interpolation function proposed .",
    "notice that in ( [ eq : fit ] ) , the argument of @xmath76 is not the simple stokes number at the kolmogorov scale , but the scale - dependent one @xmath63 : @xmath97 .",
    "this further ingredient is needed to take into account the fact that in presence of a rough underlying fluid velocity , as it happens in the inertial range of scales , no simple power law behaviour is expected for the scaling of particle velocity statistics .",
    "this was previously remarked in @xcite , in the study of heavy particle turbulent dispersion in random flows",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : fit ] ) clearly matches the two limiting behaviours for very small and very large separations . in the former case",
    ", inertia dominates the small - scale velocity statistics with respect to the underlying smooth fluid velocity , and caustics lead to a pure power - law behaviour , @xmath98 where the local stokes number has attained its dissipative limit @xmath99 .    in the latter case , at very large scales @xmath81",
    "inertia is subleading , and the typical velocity difference between particles is close to the fluid velocity increment , @xmath100 at intermediate scales , for large stokes , @xmath101 , inertia brings a non - trivial dependency via the scale - dependent stokes number , @xmath63 , and we expect a pseudo power - law scaling : @xmath102    summarising , we propose that at changing the stokes and reynolds numbers , different regimes governing the particle velocity statistics can be distinguished .",
    "the relevance of such regimes of the particle velocity statistics for the associate relative dispersion dynamics can be easily explained with the help of the sketch reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] . in the parameter space of inertia and scale separation @xmath103 , we can distinguish three regions depending whether inertia is strong or weak , and whether particle velocity difference is large or not with respect of the fluid velocity difference at comparable scale .",
    "in agreement with what commented before , we pose that the curve @xmath104 distinguishes the region of weak ( @xmath105 ) and strong inertia ( @xmath106 )",
    ".    regime ( a ) is such that inertia is important since the scale @xmath107 , and moreover the typical particle velocity increments are larger than the fluid increments . in the region ( b ) , inertia is still important but particle velocity increments are depleted with respect to the fluid increments .",
    "this typically happens for large stokes numbers , and in our dns is visible only for very large separations @xmath11 of the highest stokes @xmath108 .",
    "finally , regime ( c ) is characterised by a weak inertia , which appears only in the filtering factor for the velocity large - scale amplitude and possibly in sub - leading corrections to the tracers relative dispersion .",
    "even for the largest value of the reynolds and stokes numbers achieved in our dns , it is very difficult to disentangle quantitatively the above mentioned regimes , because of the closeness of the three relevant scales , @xmath20 , @xmath80 , and @xmath56 .        still , the quality of the fit shown in fig .  [ fig:3c ] using the global functional dependence given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) makes us confident that the main physical features are correctly captured . before closing this section",
    ", we note that there is no reason to assume that the functional form entering in the pseudo - power law scaling in the inertial range , @xmath109 , in ( [ caseb ] ) is equal the one characterizing the scaling in the viscous range , @xmath76 , in eqn .",
    "( [ casea ] ) .",
    "hint for this observation come from results obtained in @xcite for random flows , where a very high statistical accuracy can be achieved : there , depending if the underlying fluid velocity is spatially smooth or rough , a slightly different functional form has been found .",
    "the previous analysis gives us a clear quantitative picture of the scale and velocity ranges where caustics play a role in the particle dynamics .",
    "for example , for moderate stokes numbers , we have important departure from the tracers statistics only for very small scales , i.e.  caustics gives a singular contributions to the particle velocity increments inside the viscous range ; then , at larger scales , the particle velocity scaling become indistinguishable from the tracer velocities .",
    "clearly , for such stokes , no important corrections for particle separation evolution is expected with respect to the usual richardson dispersion observed for tracers .",
    "this is because particle pairs tends to separate , and very soon all pairs will attain separations where their velocities are very close to the underlying fluid . on the other hand , for very heavy particles ,",
    "those with stokes time falling inside the inertial range of fluid velocity statistics , the contribution from the caustics will be felt also at relatively large scales , up to @xmath110 .",
    "pair separations attain such scales when the initially large relative velocity difference has relaxed and become smaller than the corresponding fluid one  crossing from region ( a ) to ( b ) . notice that at @xmath111 , we have that @xmath112 , i.e.  there is a non - trivial effect from inertia .",
    "moreover , for large stokes , at scales @xmath113 , particle velocity increments are smaller than the fluid counterparts , indicating an important depletion induced by the stokes drag on the particle evolution .",
    "+ it is clear from the above discussion that new physics should appear for the value of inertia and scales separation of region ( b ) .",
    "this regime  that we can not access with the present data  is the one where a new law of pair separation should appear as recently suggested by @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the dispersion regimes of inertial particle pairs follows in the next section in terms of the time behaviour of the mean square separation distance .",
    "in this section we analyse the effects of inertia on the mean square separation of heavy particle pairs with a given initial separation distance , @xmath12 at time @xmath114 , as a function of the stokes number : @xmath115 where in the left - hand side the average is performed over all pairs of particles such that @xmath116 .",
    "the study of the relative dispersion of small , neutrally buoyant tracer particles has recently been the subject of renewed interest .",
    "this has been motivated by the fact that very accurate  highly resolved in time and space  data have become available , experimentally ( @xcite ) and numerically ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have confirmed what was known since the works of @xcite and @xcite , i.e.  the existence of different dispersive regimes for tracer pairs in turbulent flows , depending on the value of their initial distance and on the time scale considered .    when released in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic , turbulent flow with an initial separation @xmath12 in the inertial range for fluid velocity , i.e.  @xmath117 , tracer pairs",
    "initially separate according so the so - called batchelor regime , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is supposed to be a universal constant , and @xmath22 is the average kinetic energy dissipation of the flow .",
    "this _ ballistic _",
    "regime appears because initially tracers separate _ as if _ the underlying velocity field were frozen , and it lasts for a time scale that is a function of the initial separation itself , @xmath120 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "after such a transient initial time , the relative separation dynamics forgets the initial conditions and tracers separate explosively with a power law behaviour given by the richardson law : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is known as the richardson constant . as set out in monin & yaglom @xcite , the tracer separation pdf",
    " that will be discussed later  has a similar scaling behaviour in these ranges .",
    "a remarkable fact of the richardson dispersion ( [ eq : r2rich ] ) is the disappearance of the dependence on the initial separation @xmath12 , an effect also dubbed _ intrinsic stochasticity _ ( @xcite ) , which is just the signature of the non - lipschitz nature of the velocity field driving the separation between tracers , when their mutual distance is in the inertial range of fluid velocity statistics .",
    "the experimental and numerical validation of the previous prediction ( [ eq : r2rich ] ) has proved to be particularly difficult , the main reason being the strong contamination from viscous and large scale effects in the tracers dynamics . to overcome these problems , a series of techniques",
    "have been developed , including the study of _ doubling time statistics _ ; i.e.  the probability distribution function of the time needed for a pair to double its separation ( @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to these techniques , a fairly good agreement on the value of the richardson constant has been achieved .        here",
    ", we want to study how the tracer behaviour is modified by the presence of small - scale caustics in particular and by inertia effects in general , for the case of heavy particle pairs .",
    "standard direct measurements of the moments of separation as a function of time will be considered , while application of doubling time statistics is left for future studies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 ] , we show the behaviour for the mean square separation at varying the stokes number , and for two values of the initial separation .",

    "initial distances are chosen equal to @xmath50 ( left panel ) and @xmath51\\,\\eta$ ] ( right panel ) .",
    "if the initial distance is small enough ( left panel ) , the presence of caustics in the particle velocity field at initial time gives a very remarkable departure from the tracer behaviour . at increasing the stokes number ,",
    "such departure is more and more evident , and it lasts for a time lag which becomes longer and longer . for the highest value of the stokes number shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 ] ( @xmath125 ) , a sensible difference from the tracer behaviour is observed over almost two decades : @xmath126\\,\\tau_{\\eta}$ ] . a way to better visualise the departure from the tracer statistics",
    "consists in plotting the mean square separation for heavy pairs of different stokes numbers , normalised to the tracer one , that is @xmath127 this quantity is shown in the insets of figure [ fig : m2 ] .",
    "for heavy pairs starting at @xmath128 and with @xmath125 , the relative difference is as large as @xmath129 at its maximum for @xmath130 .",
    "however , such effect becomes progressively less important if we start the separation experiment from larger initial distances as shown in the right panel of the same figure .",
    "this is because , at these same stokes numbers , the deviation of particle velocity difference with respect to the underlying fluid , due to caustics , has already decreased .",
    "this is equivalent to state that , for these stokes numbers , the typical size of caustics is smaller than the initial separation @xmath12 , and particle pairs therefore separate as fluid tracers do . at larger time lags , whatever the value of the initial separation , the richardson dispersion regime is recovered .",
    "+        we now consider what happens for larger stokes numbers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : st70 ] , we show the results for the mean square separation of @xmath131 and @xmath132 and for the large reynolds number , @xmath133 .",
    "both initial distances , @xmath134 \\eta$ ] and @xmath51\\eta$ ] are displayed .",
    "as one can see , for the large value of @xmath108 , the tracer - like behaviour is never recovered , and even the separation of pairs starting with the largest distance @xmath12 is affected . the transient regime dominated by the caustics invades the whole inertial range : since particle pairs need a very long time to decrease their initial velocity difference to the value of the fluid increment at the corresponding scale , they separate with a quasi - ballistic behaviour:@xmath135 .",
    "+ the above scenario can be interpreted in terms of caustic-_dimensions_. at any value of the inertia , there exist a spatial length , of the order of the scale @xmath80 , which identifies the typical spatial size of caustics , i.e.  the range of scales where particle velocity increments are uncorrelated from the underlying fluid velocity field .",
    "if the initial pair separation @xmath12 is taken inside this region ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 ] ) , particle pair separation starts much faster than for fluid tracers , because of the much more intense velocity differences felt by the pairs inside the caustics .",
    "when particle pairs reach a separation larger than @xmath136 , they start to be synchronised with the underlying fluid velocity , recovering the typical richardson dispersion .",

    "similarly to the case of tracers , the crude approximation ( [ eq : mf1])-([eq : mf3 ] ) of the evolution of the root - mean - square distance between heavy inertial particles is able to capture the main features of the separation time behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jeremie1 - 2 ] , we show the result of the numerical integration of the set of equation ( [ eq : mf1])-([eq : mf3 ] ) obtained by an appropriate choice of the free parameters ( see figure caption ) , together with dns data from run ii , for two different large values of the stokes number .         for fixed initial separation and at increasing the intensity of the caustics velocity increments in the initial condition ( i.e.  at increasing inertia ) , the transient deviation from the richardson behaviour become more and more evident at intermediate times ( of the order of the stokes time @xmath170 , not shown ) .",
    "clearly such a simple approach can be valid only in a limited region of the phase space , where the initial conditions are , at least , at the edge of the inertial range so that k41 scaling is correct for the fluid velocity second - order increments .",
    "moreover , the matching scale where particle velocity increments become of the order of the fluid increments has to fall in the inertial range too : if this is not the case , then pairs enter the regime where inertia is important but particle relative velocity is small at scales of the dissipative range , and the mean - field closure proposed above becomes inadequate .",
    "a detailed quantitative comparison of the realm of applicability of the mean - field approach  including effects of viscous scales and small - scale caustics will be the object of future work .      despite its simplicity ,",
    "the mean - field approach described above is able to correctly reproduce the pair dispersion of heavy particles with initial data in the inertial range .",
    "we might wonder if one can draw an even simpler qualitative picture of pair dispersion .",
    "for this , we consider the behaviour of particle pairs with moderately large stokes numbers , for which inertia plays an important role for the initial transient and the richardson behaviour is slowly recovered well inside the inertial range of scales . for simplicity , we assume that the scale where the fluid and particle velocity becomes of the same order , @xmath171 , and the scale @xmath80 , where inertia ceases to be important , are very close . as it is clear from the sketch of fig .  [",
    "fig : abc ] , this may not be always the case because of the effect of the normalisation factor @xmath84 for large stokes : in the picture , it corresponds to stokes number with a narrow transient region ( b ) .",
    "the general picture then goes as follows .",
    "initially particles separate almost ballistically during a time which is of the order of ( or larger than ) the time needed by their initial , caustics - dominated , velocities to relax to the fluid velocity . after that time",
    ", particles behave as tracers and reconcile with a standard richardson dispersion .",
    "this is a first order approximation since ( _ i _ ) the fluid flow actually correlates to the particle dynamics already at very small times , and ( _ ii _ ) inertia effects are present up to large times as previously discussed .",
    "nevertheless , such an approximation should give the two correct qualitative asymptotic behaviours , at small and large time scales .",
    "since we consider moderately large values of the stokes number , the initial typical particle velocity can be assumed to be much larger than the fluid velocity , i.e.  @xmath172 [ see ( [ eq : vexact ] ) ] , and thus @xmath173 . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean square separation between particles evolves initially as : @xmath174 this should be approximately valid up to a time scale , in the inertial range , where @xmath175 : it is easy to show that such a time scale is proportional to the particle response time @xmath170 . for larger times , inertia effects become subdominant and heavy pair dispersion suddenly gets synchronised to a richardson like regime .",
    "nevertheless , this richardson regime has started only after the previous relaxation has ended , that is at a distance much larger than the original separation @xmath12 of the particle pair .",
    "the combination of this initial exponential relaxation of heavy particles with moderately large inertia , plus the later standard richardson diffusion are the two main features due to inertia in the inertial pair dispersion .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by figure  ( [ fig : jeremie3 ] ) , where we compare dns data for mean square separation , with the two phenomenological regimes just described , for which we have assumed that @xmath176 .",
    "as we can see , the main qualitative trends of the small and large time behaviours are very well captured .",
    "we have seen in previous subsections that the most noticeable effect of inertia on the mean pair dispersion is a long transient regime that takes place before reaching a richardson explosive separation ( [ eq : r2rich ] ) , and that this regime is due to the relaxation of particle velocities to those of the fluid . as we now argue , at larger times  corresponding to regime ( c)there is still an effect of particle inertia that can be measured in terms of subleading corrections to the richardson law . to estimate these corrections ,",
    "let us assume that in the mean - field equation ( [ eq : mf2 ] ) , the term stemming from the fluid velocity @xmath177 is much larger than the inertia term @xmath178 .",

    "equation ( [ eq : mf_maxeyapprox ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath186 where @xmath187 is an order - unity constant .",
    "the initial condition is given by @xmath188 where the initial separation has to be chosen such such that @xmath189 .",
    "we can next integrate the approximate dynamics perturbatively in terms of the small parameter @xmath190 by expanding the separation as @xmath191 .",
    "the leading order is @xmath192^{3/2}$ ] and corresponds to the relative dispersion of a pair of tracers .",
    "the first - order correction reads @xmath193 . at times much larger than the batchelor time associated to the initial separation @xmath194 ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath195 , the leading term follows the richardson explosive law @xmath196 .",

    "one can clearly see that data almost collapse on a line @xmath201 confirming the behaviour ( [ eq : correcrichard ] ) predicted above . only results from run",
    "i are displayed here .",
    "the reason is that the very large time statistics of tracer dispersion in run ii is not as well statistically converged , leading to more noisy data .",
    "the qualitative picture is however very similar .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us stress that we have assumed above k41 scaling to hold for the acceleration field ( and thus for the pressure gradient ) .",
    "however it is well known that the scaling properties of pressure are still unclear : they might depend on the turbulent flow reynolds number and/or on the type of flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as stated in @xcite , rather than being dominated by k41 scaling , numerically estimated pressure increments of run i ( @xmath202 ) seem to be ruled by sweeping , so that @xmath203 .",
    "one can easily check that this difference in scaling leads to a behaviour similar to ( [ eq : correcrichard ] ) , except that this time logarithmic corrections are absent , and that the non - dimensional constant @xmath199 depends on the reynolds number of the flow .",

    "as it has been numerically shown in @xcite for three - dimensional turbulent flows , the correlation dimension depends only on the degree of inertia @xmath9 , while it does not seem to depend on the reynolds number of the flow . for @xmath232 , the effective degree of compressibility",
    "is no longer constant , but varies with the scale .",
    "+ second , the underlying velocity field exhibits spatial and temporal correlations that are much more complex than in a gaussian short - correlated field .",
    "such correlations lead to non - trivial overlaps between particle dynamics and the carrying flow topology . as a result",

    "we first notice that the separation probability density function that is valid in the rough case ( [ eq : rich_k ] ) has an asymptotic stretched - exponential decay that is independent on the compressibility degree .",

    "i.e.  @xmath73 , one can correctly assume that the effective degree of compressibility is constant and therefore apply either the small - scale limit for rough flows ( [ eq : rich_k ] ) , or that for smooth flows ( [ eq : rich_lognormal ] ) , depending on the scaling properties of the particle velocity field entailed in the value of the exponent @xmath76 , defined from ( [ eq : gamma_st ] ) and related to the caustics .",

    "this will matter in the case of light particle separation , where , due to strong preferential concentration , the probability of finding pairs at a very small distances is large enough to allow for a detailed test of the prediction ( [ eq : log ] ) .",
    "the case of light particles will be discussed in  [ sec : light ] , while we now turn to a discussion of the above scenario in the case of heavy particle pairs .",
    "we start by analyzing the qualitative evolution of @xmath240 at changing time , for different stokes numbers and in the limit @xmath241 .",
    "the four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] show the evolution of the pdf at different times for pairs with @xmath242 ( tracers ) , and for heavy particles with @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath132 .",

    "qualitatively , the pdf evolution is very similar for all moderate stokes numbers , and the pdfs at different moderate stokes numbers become more and more similar with time .",
    "however in the case of @xmath108for which the associate stokes time @xmath170 falls well inside the inertial range , the pdf shows a long exponential tail for intermediate separation , which tends to persist at all observed times .",
    "to better appreciate such differences , in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the comparison between the different pdfs corresponding to various stokes numbers for two different times : at the beginning of the separation process , @xmath246 , and at a later time , @xmath247 .",
    "as one can see , it is only at early times that the pdfs for moderate - to - large stokes , @xmath68 differ in a sensible way from the tracers .",
    "in particular , one can clearly see that many pairs have separations much larger and much smaller than those observed for tracers or for heavy pairs with small stokes numbers .",
    "the right tails , describing pairs that are very far apart , are just the signature of the _ scrambling _ effect of caustics .",
    "such strong events are not captured by second order moments of the separation statistics that we discussed before , while they clearly affect higher - order moments .",
    "the left tails , associated to pairs much closer than tracers , are possibly due to particles that separate at a slower rate than tracers because of preferential concentration induced by inertia .    later in the evolution , for @xmath248 , only the separation pdf for @xmath108 still shows important departure from the tracer case ; for all the other stokes numbers shown , pairs have had enough time to forget their initial distribution and have practically relaxed on the typical richardson - like distribution . in the inset , we also show the persistence in the exponential behaviour for the pdf at @xmath108 , by superposing the shapes measured at three times during the particles separation .    with the present data the small scale asymptotic behaviour ( [ eq : log ] ) can not be validated for heavy particles .",
    "this is due to the limited statistics : very soon after the initial time @xmath205 , there are almost no pairs left with separations @xmath73 .      at moderate to large stokes numbers",
    "the separation process of heavy particle pairs is largely influenced by the presence of large velocity differences at small scales , that is by the presence of caustics in the particles velocity field . in ",
    "[ sec:1 ] , we have studied stationary statistics ( only first - order moment ) of velocity differences between heavy particles at changing the distance between particles and their inertia .",
    "however it is also informative to look at the non - stationary , time - dependent distribution of velocity differences , and more particularly to its distribution measured along heavy pairs separation .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath249 can be decomposed into the projection along the separation vector , and two transveral components , here equivalent since the system is statistically isotropic . for tracer particles ,",
    "the statistics of relative velocity and the alignment properties of @xmath250 and @xmath251 have been discussed extensively ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . here , we focus on the pdf of the relative longitudinal velocity only , which we denote by @xmath252 , where @xmath253    \\cdot \\hat{\\bm r}(t)}$ ] .        for pairs of tracers ( @xmath242 ) , the initial longitudinal velocity distribution is nothing else than the pdf of eulerian longitudinal velocity increments measured at the distance @xmath12 . for pairs of inertial particles ,",

    "heavy pairs , the first effect has not an important signature on small - scale quantities .",

    "each panel contains the pdfs measured at different times spanning all turbulent timescales . at @xmath114 ,",
    "the importance of caustics is manifest for the two largest stokes numbers , leading to fat tails towards both small and large velocity differences .",
    "interestingly enough , the left tail of @xmath252 , which describes approaching events of particle relative motion , is immediately dumped already at @xmath256 ; at the same time , however , the right tail continues to be quite fat for the two largest stokes numbers under consideration . at later stages of the separation process , the tendency of large - stokes - number pairs to wash out approaching events becomes even stronger .",
    "indeed , at time @xmath257 , the small velocity increments tail has almost disappeared for pairs with @xmath108 .",
    "it is worth noticing that at those times ( i.e.  also at those typical scales ) , heavy particle velocity differences have already started to be smaller than the tracer velocity increments : the larger is the stokes number , the less pronounced are the pdf tails .",
    "summarising , because of the different effects of inertia , we observe a very complex evolution for the longitudinal relative velocity fluctuations along the trajectories of heavy particle pairs .",
    "this is certainly a key issue to be considered for stochastic modelling : here , as in a standard _ kinetic _",
    "problem , both particle positions and velocities need to be modelled to quantitatively control the relative dispersion process .",
    "so far we have considered the relative motion of very heavy particle pairs , for which the density contrast @xmath8 with the underlying fluid is zero . in this section",
    "we present results on light particles dynamics as described by ( [ eq:1 ] ) , for different possible choices of the parameters @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss how the strong effect of preferential concentration  typically observed in the case of light particles in turbulent flows might influence the intermediate and long - time behaviour of pair separations . in three - dimensional turbulent flows , as we consider here , light particles associated to different values of @xmath9 have been observed to always possess a positive largest lyapunov exponent  @xcite : this implies that light pairs always separate in @xmath258 real turbulent flows .",
    "we recall , however , that this is not always true : for instance , in smooth two - dimensional random flows , there are values of @xmath9 for which the largest lyapunov exponent can become negative and particles form pointwise clusters ( see @xcite ) .    light particles with moderate inertia and high density ratio ( order - unity @xmath7 , and @xmath259 ) , initially tend to separate much slower than heavy particles with the similar stokes number : this is evident from the much smaller values of the lyapunov exponents measured for light particles , with respect to those measured for heavy particles with equivalent stokes numbers but @xmath241 .",
    "moreover , finite - time lyapunov exponents show large fluctuations , indicating that there are pairs that do not separate even at long times .",
    "results on this issue will be reported elsewhere . clearly",
    ", pairs of light particles that do not separate do not influence the mean square distances : hence , we do not expect , and indeed do not measure , any large differences for the long - time behaviour of @xmath260 for light particles , with respect to the heavy case ( see fig .",

    "it is natural to ask if light particle strong preferential concentration affects high - order moments of relative separation of two initially close particles , and particularly the left tail of the separation pdf .",
    "figure  [ fig : light1 ] shows the time evolution of the separation probability density function , @xmath261 .",

    "a remarkable observation is a strong tendency to fill small separations . in other words",

    "this is the confirmation that the small - scale dynamics of the highly clustered light particles evolves as that of tracers moving in a smooth , compressible flow ( characterised by the same @xmath228 ) .",
    "we also remark that if there is high spatial preferential concentration , caustics can not be important .",
    "this may have important consequences for the estimation of collision kernel of light particles .",

    ".    the importance of preferential concentration can also be appreciated by looking at the pdfs of longitudinal velocity differences between light particles during the separation .",
    "we show such distributions for one of the pair family considered above , and we compare them with those of the tracers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : light2 ] ) .",
    "the important difference between the two cases stems from the highly peaked nature of the relative velocity pdf for the strong clustered light particle case .",
    "the presence of many pairs with almost vanishing velocity differences is the signature of a coherent bunch of pairs moving on a strongly clustered set .",
    "we have studied the relative dispersion of inertial particles in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence from two dns at resolutions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath267 and @xmath268 , respectively .",
    "we have analysed both heavy and light particle statistics at changing the stokes numbers .",
    "we have studied the evolution of mean separations and the whole pdfs shape , both for particle distance and velocity increments at changing time and for different typical initial distances .",
    "the main results that we have discussed can be summarised as follows",
    ". separations of very heavy particles , with stokes times falling in the inertial range of the underlying fluid , are strongly affected by the presence of caustics up to times , when the distance between particles reaches scales that are large enough for the separation dynamics to be again dominated by the underlying flow velocity . as a consequence , strong transient departure from the richardson diffusion , with a faster ballistic regime , is observed . a statistical closure of the equation of motions for heavy particle separation is also developed .",
    "this model is able to reproduce the main numerical findings .",
    "+ for light particles , at high density ratio , we observe strong small - scale clustering properties , leading to a considerable fraction of pairs that do not separate at all  although the maximum lyapunov exponent remains positive . in such a case , the non - stationary spatial concentration at small scales tends to be higher than the analogous case but with a stationary distribution of particles .",
    "such numerical findings open the way to experimental verifications and gives input to the community involved in modelling inertial particle diffusion in applied configurations .",
