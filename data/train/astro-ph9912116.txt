    "hyper - particles are quasi - one - dimensional entities of various types such that , at the intersection of a hyper - particle and the observable universe , we observe a quasi - zero - dimensional particle corresponding to a known particle type .",
    "the hyper - particles are not assumed stationary ; they are not like `` world - lines '' defined in other formulations@xcite . rather , the hyper - particles move and obey kinematics rules to be derived later in the discussion .",

    "the principle of relativity requires that hyper - particles be everywhere perpendicular to the local direction of the observed universe .",
    "if hyper - particles were not everywhere perpendicular to the local observed universe , then a local measurement could distinguish one direction in the observable universe from all others , in violation of relativity .",
    "thus , in figure1 , the observable universe is shown deforming near each hyper - particle to be locally perpendicular to it .",

    "the rate of local time at any location must vary inversely as the local thickness of the observable universe .",
    "otherwise a local measurement of the thickness of the universe using , for instance , the time it takes for light to cross the local thickness of that observable universe , would distinguish one point in space from another by local measurement , which would violate relativity .",

    "equation([eq:4 ] ) includes an ambiguity regarding whether , for a given angle , the observed particle travels towards positive or towards negative @xmath28 .      an observed particle may have finite lifetime due to a number of causes .",
    "one cause can be that a particle is observed to come into existence in any particular observable universe when a hyper - particle first intersects that particular observable universe , and is destroyed when the hyper - particle no longer intersects that observable universe .",

    "[ even though the thickness of the observable universe varies as @xmath18/cos@xmath23 , the local rate of time varies also as t / cos@xmath23 . hence the velocity of hyper - particle through the observable universe proportional to @xmath41 , which is independent of @xmath23 . ] finally , since the clock rate varies as per equation([eq:1 ] ) , thus , to satisfy equation([eq:5 ] ) for all velocities of the particle , the length of the hyper - particle must be l=@xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the length of the hyper - particle for that particle when at rest .",
    "thus , the length of the hyper - particle increases in proportion to @xmath44 , which causes the observed lifetime of the observed particle to increase in proportion to @xmath44 , in accord with relativity .",
    "the observance of particle anti - particle pair formation provides one determination for @xmath40 .",
    "it also provides one resolution for the `` @xmath45 '' direction ambiguity for the observed velocity , @xmath46 , in equation([eq:4 ] ) . referring to figure1 ,",
    "hyper - particles 2 and 3 touch at a point below the observed universe , @xmath15 .",
    "if the hyper - particles are moving towards positive @xmath19 , then , when that point goes through @xmath15 , the observed effect will be of two particles colliding and annihilating  as particle and anti - particle .",
    "if they are moving towards negative @xmath19 , then they were seen already to come into existence via pair formation , and are seen as moving away from each other .",
    "the event of particle anti - particle pair formation will be seen in each observable universe , @xmath17 , if hyper - particles 2 and 3 stay exactly touching each other ( as in figure1 ) while flowing through \\{@xmath17}. that is achieved if the hyper - particle velocity along @xmath28 is zero .",

    "for example , the spatial configuration at @xmath83 at global time @xmath13 will recur at @xmath82 at time @xmath84 .",
    "thus , defining the observable universe at @xmath82 as the `` present '' , then the `` future '' is at @xmath81 .",

    "while @xmath6 is correlated with a time coordinate , it is not a time coordinate . traveling in @xmath6 , if possible , is not traveling in time .",
    "it is traveling to a place whose spatial configuration is correlated with a spatial configuration that existed elsewhere at another time , and the correlation is reduced , according to equation([eq:17 ] ) , by the presence of relativistic objects whose events travel through w at reduced speed .",

    "equation([eq:17 ] ) provides a translation of that into the euclidean formulation as @xmath92 .",

    "our observation of only the spatial dimensions @xmath3 while residing in a euclidean @xmath8 space is data that provides new understanding of our nature as observers . in the construction , @xmath15",
    "was defined as an observable universe , such that an observer in @xmath15 observes only that one observable universe .",
    "equation([eq:19 ] ) indicates that light - like hyper - particles in any @xmath17 are trapped in that @xmath17 and observe only that which is in that observable universe .",
    "that is , light - like particles , are limited to observing @xmath3 .",
    "all other hyper - particles experience many observable universes .",
    "thus , some key aspect of us as observers , e.g. the mechanism of memory and/or observation , though not necessarily the physical body , must be fundamentally light - like .",
    "each observer sees past , present , and future unfold in one observable universe .",
    "the spatially correlated configurations on other observable universes are not something that we typically see .",
    "those configurations are simply correlated configurations , and by the time they come to pass on the observable universe where a particular observer sees them , those configurations no longer exist on any other observable universe .    for each observer ,",
    "the calculation of lorentz distances is correct over a region of space in which the path of light is perpendicular to the hyper - particle of the observer .",
    "for example , in figure 1 , an observer at particle 1 can correctly assume a flat observable universe in calculating the lorentz distances between it and particles 2 and 3 .",
    "observers at particles 2 and 3 can not , however , correctly assume that their flat observable universe extends to either of the other particles . in trying to do so",
    ", observers at particles 2 and 3 obtain the wrong answers .",
    "this resolves the twin paradox@xcite in the euclidean formulation .",
    "the observer at particle 1 in figure 1 is special because it is at rest with respect to the larger observable universe .",
    "it also has the fastest rate of aging .",
    "the shape of the observable universe can be mapped by measuring the velocity at which the clock rate is maximal at various locations .",
    "this does not imply a global rest frame , since there is no mechanism that fixes the motion of any observable universe relative to the euclidean frame .",
    "also , it does not violate relativity since the local observer at particle 1 can not determine that it is special by any local measurement .",
    "energy conservation is required within each observable universe for compliance with both newtonian and relativistic mechanics .",
    "since hyper - particles flow through the observable universe with a fixed speed @xmath96 , by equation([eq:8 ] ) , hence , if hyper - particles have mass energy per unit length , then that mass energy density is constant over the length of the hyper - particle . otherwise the quantity of mass energy entering the sub - space would be different from the quantity leaving the sub - space , and energy would not be conserved in the sub - space .",
    "the mass energy of the observed particle is the product of the mass energy per unit length , @xmath97 , times the length of hyper - particle within the observed universe , @xmath98 . defining @xmath99 as the rest mass of the particle ,",
    "then the mass energy of a particle at any velocity is @xmath100{}}.\\ ] ] the mass energy in equation([eq:20 ] ) corresponds with the combined value for the kinetic energy plus mass energy in special relativity .",
    "hence , in the euclidean formulation , the kinematic energy of the particle is a contribution to the mass energy .",
    "observed particles have no kinetic energy apart from their mass energy .    as the velocity of an observed particle changes , the length of the corresponding hyper - particle within the observable universe changes . yet , since @xmath40 is a constant , hence the rate of hyper - particle entering and leaving the observable universe remains unchanged .",
    "hence , the energy required to generate increased length comes from inside the observable universe , perhaps exchanged between hyper - particles within the observable universe by forces within that observable universe .",
    "special relativity provides momentum as @xmath101 .",
    "since each of the terms on the right of this equation is defined in the new formulation in accord with special relativity , the mathematical quantity @xmath102 can be defined in euclidean @xmath8 space as an observable three - vector locally within any observable universe .",
    "since the energy , @xmath103 , is also in accord with special relativity , it follows that , mathematically , the equations for conservation of this momentum are identical to the lorentz formulation .    in this formulation",
    "the interpretation of momentum changes slightly because the mass of the particle is physically a function of its velocity .",
    "that is , @xmath104 is physically the mass of the hyper - particle .",
    "the interpretation appears to apply even for photons traveling at the speed of light . for photons ,",
    "the entire hyper - particle is observed .",
    "thus , their energy is the mass of the entire hyper - particle and the momentum is that mass times the velocity , @xmath27 .",
    "the ubiquitous redshift of light from distant astronomic phenomena may be interpreted as a result of the expansion of the universe@xcite .",
    "the hubble constant , @xmath105 , indicates , in particular , a linear relation ( at least approximately ) between the distance to an object and the size of the red shift .",
    "one approach to modeling such expansion is to give the observable universe a curvature of radius , @xmath106 , with an expansion rate @xmath107 .",
    "if the relation between distance and red shift is linear , then r is constant , otherwise r may be a function of position .    with the addition of this curvature , within the euclidean formulation , each observable universe becomes a hollow sphere ( if r is constant ) whose surface area and volume is finite and which grows over time .",
    "the thickness , @xmath18 , also must increase over time in proportion , by relativity .",

    "it highlights three select observable universes of a continuous set . at every location",
    "there is a local @xmath19 coordinate that corresponds by euclidean transformation ( spatial rotation and translation ) to a global radial coordinate , @xmath106 . from a global perspective , the observable universes are seen to expand outward towards @xmath108 , while locally hyper - particles flow towards @xmath109 at the local speed of light .",
    "figures 1 through 3 , may be viewed as close - ups of a very small and therefore nearly flat sections of the curved observable universes shown in figure 4 .        extending the principle of relativity across observable universes ,",
    "it is possible to determine many properties of the universe expansion .",
    "of course , since the corpus of experimental results all apply to one observable universe , there is no direct measurement that indicates that relativity applies across observable universes .",
    "however , that aside , relativity implies the following constraints in order that an observer can not distinguish observable universes :    1 .",
    "@xmath110 so that the circumference of each observable universe is the same number of wavelengths for all @xmath106 ; 2 .   @xmath111 so that the ratio of the circumference to the thickness is the same for each observable universe ; 3 .",
    "the rate of aging is independent of @xmath106 , by equation([eq:1 ] ) combined with constraints 1 and 2 above .",
    "an observable universe has two ages@xcite :    * time in current seconds since the start of the universe as computed from the hubble constant , @xmath105 * evolutionary age computed as the integral of @xmath1 from @xmath13=0 to the present time .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is determined by measurement of the expansion - induced relative velocity between particles some distance apart in the observable universe . that velocity is observed not with a ruler , but rather as a change in the time for light to travel between two particles . for hyper - particles 1 and 2 in figure 4",

    "this prediction is consistent with data that has generally shown , until recently reinterpreted to reduce the discrepancy @xcite , that the age of the universe , as obtained from observations of astronomic evolution , is greater than that computed from the hubble constant .",

    "first , gravity is a force associated with mass . in particular , gravity is a function of the distance from the mass ( measured along a curve within @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus , while the three - dimensional deformation of @xmath17 near each hyper - particle may be gravity - induced refraction ( see section [ sec : futuredirections ] ) , the @xmath106-dependent gradient of the speed of light has the wrong spatial dependence to be related to the distance from mass .",
    "second , since gravity is a force , hence , if it is present , then there should be a tell - tale deceleration of @xmath17 . in particular , the gravitational force on the observable universe , @xmath15 at @xmath123 would be proportional to the integral of the mass from @xmath132 to @xmath133 . instead , by relativity , in order that observable universes can not be distinguished by the ratio of the expansion rate to the speed of light , and by equation([eq : cproptort ] ) , hence the rate of radial motion at any point in the universe at any time must be : @xmath134 equation ( [ eq : vr ] ) can be manipulated to compute the time dependence of the radius , @xmath135 , of any particular observable universe , @xmath17 .",
    "first , representing @xmath136 as a differential gives : @xmath137{}},\\ ] ] which can be rearranged as : @xmath138{}}.\\ ] ] both sides are integrated to give @xmath139 { } } , \\label{eq : radiusvstime}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the radius of @xmath17 at @xmath141 .",
    "equation([eq : radiusvstime ] ) shows that the rate of expansion for any particular observable universe , in global time units , is constant - there is no deceleration .",
    "hence , either the gravitational force is cancelled by another force , or it does not exist on this grand scale or in the @xmath106 direction . in any case , the refraction that closes each observable universe exists by some cause other than gravity .",
    "equations([eq : cproptort ] ) and ( [ eq : vexp ] ) show singularities occuring at @xmath141 , similar to those implied by the `` big bang '' theories .",
    "however , equation([eq : infiniteage ] ) describing the evolutionary age of the universe applies for all times @xmath13 .",
    "thus , even when the universe was one global second old , the evolutionary age was already infinite .    in the early universe ,",
    "clocks ran faster so the rate of system evolution was higher .",
    "the general relationship between the global and local rates of time can be derived by changing the integration limits on equation([eq : infiniteage ] ) .",
    "this gives : @xmath142 with this normalization , @xmath2 and @xmath13 have the same values and derivatives at time @xmath121 .",
    "when @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and when @xmath145 , @xmath141 .",
    "when the universe was one global second old , the local clock rate on our observable universe , @xmath15 , would have been approximately @xmath146 times its current rate ( using 16 billion years as its current age ) .",
    "the rapid clock rate of the early universe may have been undetectable by local measurement .",
    "for example , the circumnavigation time in local seconds , @xmath147 , for light to complete a trip around a particular observable universe was the same when the universe was one second old as it is now .",
    "the circumnavigation time is obtained by combining equations ( [ eq : cproptort ] ) , ( [ eq : dtdt ] ) , and ( [ eq : radiusvstime ] ) .",
    "this gives : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the speed of light vs. time on observable universe @xmath17 , and @xmath150 is the circumnagivation time in global seconds .",
    "thus , the observed circumnagivation time is the same on all observable universes at all times , even when the universe was one global second old",
    ".    some of the predicted phenomona of the `` big bang '' theories may still apply .",
    "for instance , if @xmath151 , then all of the observable universes were collapsed to a point at t=0 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath152 , then the observable universes did not collapse to a point at t=0",
    ".    our interpretation of the expansion rate of the universe is also affected by local time .",
    "equation([eq : radiusvstime ] ) shows a constant rate of expansion with respect to global time .",
    "however , substituting equation([eq : tvst ] ) into equation([eq : radiusvstime ] ) gives the expansion as a function of local time : @xmath153 thus , the universe is expanding exponentially with respect to local time , i.e. , the expansion is accelerating@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the motion of @xmath17 even absent the presence of hyper - particles indicates that space has substance as a continuum in accord with other models@xcite@xcite .",
    "a lagrangian density , @xmath39 , is defined here to describe that continuum as an ideal cosmological fluid : @xmath154 here @xmath155 represents @xmath156 , @xmath157 is the time - dependent density of the cosmological fluid , @xmath158 is the time - dependent velocity of the fluid , @xmath159 is a real constant of currently unknown value , and @xmath160(w , x , y , z , t ) is a lagrange multiplier@xcite . the first term of the lagrangian density is the kinetic energy density ; the second term is a harmonic potential energy density ; and the third term is continuity as a holonomic constraint . because the fluid is an ideal fluid",
    ", there are no terms in the lagrangian density for internal properties of the fluid such as temperature or entropy .",
    "the holonomic constraint requires that fluid can not simply disappear in one place and reappear in another ; it requires that transport of fluid occur via its motion from location to location .",
    "the lagrangian is the four dimensional integral of the lagrangian density over the spatial coordinates @xmath8 .",
    "the lagrangian gives rise to two lagrange equations , a vector equation from the variation of the lagrangian with respect to @xmath161 and a scalar equation from its variation with respect to @xmath162 .",
    "the vector lagrange equation , for any lagrangian density that is a function of @xmath161 and its first derivatives but not higher order derivatives , is given by : @xmath163 substituting in @xmath39 from equation([eq : lagrangian ] ) , this vector equation reduces to : @xmath164{}}. \\label{eq : lagrangianvmu}\\ ] ] this result is general to all solutions of this lagrangian and reduces the theory to a bi - scalar theory , where @xmath162 and @xmath160 are the two scalar fields .",
    "the scalar lagrange equation , for any lagrangian density that is a function of @xmath162 and its first derivatives but not higher order derivatives , is given by : @xmath165 substituting @xmath39 from equation ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) and reducing by use of equation([eq : lagrangianvmu ] ) gives @xmath166 which which must be solved together with the continuity equation .",
    "the continuity equation , after substitution from equation[eq : lagrangianvmu ] , is @xmath167 a closed form solution to the lagrange equation that satisfies continuity , is : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the number of spatial dimensions of the universe [ which is at least four to include @xmath8 ] , and where @xmath171 .",
    "the value of @xmath172 is undetermined . at @xmath141",
    "both scalar fields are infinite exposing the same `` big bang '' type singularity as seen earlier .",
    "the dimensional dependence of @xmath162 in equation ( [ eq : lagrangiansolution ] ) concurs with the analysis in section3.5 .",
    "in particular , it shows the volume of each observable universe expanding as @xmath173 for a @xmath8 space , which corresponds to each observable universe expanding both due to the increasing radius and due to its increasing thickness , @xmath18 , as predicted by relativity arguments in the earlier section .",
    "the radial velocity of each point in the universe is computed by differentiating @xmath160 as per equation([eq : lagrangianvmu ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath174 which is consistent with equation ( [ eq : vr ] ) and determines that @xmath151 .",
    "thus , for this solution , the universe was collapsed to a point at @xmath141 which would be in accord with `` big bang '' theories .",
    "an alternate closed form solution for this lagrangian is : @xmath175{}}{\\makebox[4em]{}}\\nobreakspace .",
    "\\label{eq : lagrangiansolution2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this solution provides @xmath152 .",
    "thus if the actual universe obeys this solution , then the universe was not collapsed to a point at @xmath141 , contrary to `` big bang '' theories .",
    "both of the solutions show closure of the universe even before hyper - particles or mass are introduced .",
    "a key future goal is to incorporate hyper - particles into the lagrangian as perturbations on @xmath162 and @xmath160 , and to solve thereby for the structure of the fundamental particles . that further may lead to a derivation of the forces between particles as interactions among those perturbations and to a determination of the fundamental constants and any scaling of those constants over time and space .",
    "it may further lead to an exploration of a four - dimensional euclidean momentum with possible conservation laws and , separately to an exploration of the relation between the presented theory and standard string theories .",
    "mapping general relativity into the euclidean formulation may be achievable by an investigation of the relationship between gravity and the deformations of @xmath17 near hyper - particles .",
    "the possibility of non - gravitationally induced refraction on astronomic scales may imply that some phenomena currently ascribed to dark matter @xcite may actually be unrelated to gravity and due rather to the new phenomenon shown here to cause the refraction that closes the universe .",
    "other unknowns to be investigated include the possibility of freeing oneself from a particular observable universe to directly observe others , and the possibility of additional euclidean dimensions as might be inferred from experimental observations .",
    "additionally , a goal is to determine the thickness of the observable universe ( a value for @xmath18 ) .",
    "also the ratio between the expansion rate of the universe and the speed of light is of fundamental interest .",
    "the separation of lorentz time into three parameters  global time , a global spatial coordinate , and a local rate of aging that is a function of position and time ,  has enabled successful formulation of relativity in a global @xmath5 euclidean space .",
    "the new formulation agrees with the main predictions of special relativity , provides re - interpretation of some relativistic phenomena , and provides new predictions .",
    "some of the predictions are supported by existing experimental evidence .",
    "others may be tested by future experiments .",
    "the predictions are derived by the application of the principle of relativity via geometry and supported by a new lagrangian describing the universe as an ideal cosmological fluid .",
    "sample predictions include :    * the age of the universe as measured by the hubble constant is finite , while that measured by system evolution is infinite . *",
    "the universe is closed by refraction without gravity or dark matter , implying a new phenomenon at astronomic scales . *",
    "the speed of light varies throughout the universe . *",
