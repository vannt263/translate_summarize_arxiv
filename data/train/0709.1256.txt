    "this is a discussion document aimed at stimulating discussion of a fresh round of high quality experiments on baryon and meson spectroscopy .",
    "qcd is widely believed to lead to confinement of mesons and baryons .",
    "lattice gauge calculations are now possible with unquenched quarks .",
    "the opportunity exists to confront these calculations with as complete a spectrum as possible of experimentally observed states .",
    "the experiments could be done quite cheaply and quickly .",
    "this is not just ` stamp - collecting ' , as some cynics claim . without such data ,",
    "it is not possible to say exactly how qcd really works in the non - perturbative regime . understanding confinement is a key issue in particle physics , but it is being neglected .",
    "confinement is clearly a phase transition , but it is quite possible that it exhibits similar subtlety to chemistry and solid state physics .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is also clearly a phase transition .",
    "its relation to confinement needs to be understood .",
    "perhaps they are the same phase transition , perhaps they are related in a more subtle way .    hybrids and glueballs are expected , but without a complete picture of quark - model states , progress in identifying them is frustrated .",
    "what role , if any , do glueballs play in the confinement process ?",
    "the baryon and light meson sectors are the ones where it is presently technically feasible to achieve a complete spectroscopy or something close .",
    "many @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonances are known up to @xmath9 mev @xcite .",
    "they are readily interpreted as 3-quark states .",
    "however , the spectrum is incomplete .",
    "low spin states are missing , or poorly identified .",
    "no member of the su6 \\{20 } multiplet is firmly established , although there are candidates ; perhaps they do not exist .",
    "present baryon results come largely from experiments in the 1960 - 70 era using liquid hydrogen and polarised targets .",
    "there are also good data on @xmath10 @xcite and a little on @xmath11 @xcite",
    ". the crystal ball collaboration has produced data on @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "data on further inelastic channels come from bubble chamber experiments but with low statistics ; these have been analysed by manley and saleski @xcite .",
    "there are also low statistics data on @xmath14 and @xmath15 final states , including polarisation information from hyperon decays @xcite .",
    "experiments on photoproduction are beginning to make decisive contributions @xcite but the photon spin complicates the analysis . the clas collaboration at jlab proposes to take data with polarised photons and a polarised target .",
    "this will augment existing data @xcite and strengthen the partial wave analysis considerably .",
    "complementary information from @xmath16 , with its simpler spin structure , would strengthen this partial wave analysis , and would also isolate couplings specific to photons .",
    "because of the spin 1/2 of the nucleon , it is essential to have polarisation data .",
    "these data also fulfill a second important role .",
    "differential cross sections depend on intensities of partial waves and the real parts of interferences between them . the quantity @xmath17 depends on @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the spin - averaged amplitude and @xmath20 the spin - flip amplitude .",
    "it is therefore phase sensitive and plays a key role in establishing the phase variation of amplitudes .",
    "[ htb ]    [ fig . 1 ]",
    "-6 mm    in the near future , several major @xmath21 detectors will complete their current programmes : belle , babar , cleo c , and kloe .",
    "they are superb detectors which have much to offer for the experiments proposed here .",
    "the one new feature which is required is a frozen spin polarised target .",
    "the technology of such targets is well developed and costs a small fraction of the detectors themselves . rather than scrapping these detectors or cannibalising them ,",
    "why not put some of them to use on a new programme of spectroscopy ?",
    "the statistics required are modest , so the required data could be collected quite quickly",
    ".    the partial wave analysis would be the bigger problem .",
    "why not harness the efforts of the army of phenomenologists who speculate on how qcd works to doing the partial wave analysis and finding out how it really does work ?",
    "this would be a welcome return to an earlier generation where experimentalists and phenomenologists worked hand in hand .    in the light meson sector ,",
    "the spectrum is incomplete around 1600 - 1700 mev . in the mass range 1910 - 2400 mev , data from lear",
    "provide a complete spectrum of @xmath22 , @xmath23 states , summarised in the final coupled - channel analysis of @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is currently not listed in the regular part of the particle data book , because this is the only experiment to observe most of the states ; results are to be found on pp 644 - 648 of @xcite .",
    "it is important to realise that many of the states have been identified in as many as 7 independent sets of data .",
    "this makes identification of resonances extremely secure : it can be shown by analysing sub - sets of these data that the confidence level increases roughly as 2 to the power of the number of data sets . for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the combined fit has a confidence level better than the best individual set by a factor 60 .",
    "this multiplicity of final states needs to be studied in baryon spectroscopy .    figs .",
    "1 to 3 show the known light mesons above 1 gev @xcite .",
    "they fall into a simple pattern of parallel regge trajectories .",
    "klempt has drawn attention to the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath8 states fall on similar trajectories of almost the same slope , but with larger errors @xcite .",
    "an intriguing feature of both meson and baryon spectra is the appearance of parity doublets : states with the same isospin @xmath27 and spin @xmath28 , but opposite parity @xmath29 .",
    "it is a feature of qcd that it is @xmath30 symmetric if quark masses are negligible .",
    "however , it is well known that this symmetry is spontaneously broken for the lowest states .",
    "firstly , the nucleon has no nearby @xmath31 partner .",
    "secondly , in the meson sector , well identified adler zeros in @xmath32 and @xmath33 elastic scattering arise from chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "[ htp ]    [ fig .",
    "2 ] -4 mm    glozman @xcite proposes in a series of papers that chiral symmetry is approximately restored high in the spectrum .",
    "this would require @xmath34 mesons at masses close to the well known @xmath35 states @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "likewise @xmath38 partners are needed for the well known @xmath39 ground - states @xmath40 and @xmath41 . however , these states are currently missing @xcite , raising questions about this scheme .",
    "jaffe also comments on the question of chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "shifman and vainstein present disagreements with glozman s scheme @xcite .",
    "a feature of states labelled @xmath42 on fig .",
    "1 is that they lie systematically lower in mass than those labelled @xmath43 by @xmath44 mev .",
    "the labelling arises from the fact that @xmath43 states ( a ) decay mostly with @xmath45 and ( b ) are nearly degenerate with @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons .",
    "likewise , @xmath48 states lie systematically above @xmath29 states by @xmath49 mev",
    ". however , glozman objects that orbital angular momentum should not be a good quantum number for a rapidly rotating string with highly relativistic quarks attached to each end",
    ". instead @xmath28 should be the good quantum number @xcite .",
    "afonin @xcite provides an excellent general review of the history and details of the spectroscopy .",
    "he arrives at a different scheme where states fall more naturally into hydrogen - like representations of the dynamical o(4 ) group .",
    "this difference from glozman immediately illustrates the fact that better and more complete data are required to settle even the general features of how qcd actually works .",
    "afonin also traces a very interesting connection of macdowell symmetry from the baryon to the meson sector @xcite .",
    "experiment might provide a useful guideline to methods of approximation in lattice gauge calculations .",
    "-6 mm    [ htp ]    [ fig .",
    "3 ] -4 mm    the light @xmath50 mesons are particularly poorly identified .",
    "the essential reason for this is that each state has a width @xmath51 mev , but @xmath4 and @xmath5 states overlap at mass intervals less than this .",
    "if crystal barrel data are a guide , @xmath4 states should decay dominantly with @xmath52 in the final state ( e.g. to @xmath53_{l=0}$ ] ) while @xmath5 states should decay dominantly with @xmath54 .",
    "if so , an experiment on diffraction dissociation of transversely polarised photons should make a clear distinction between @xmath4 and @xmath5 states . for @xmath48-wave decays",
    ", the partial wave decomposition is @xmath55 a linearly polarised photon is a superposition of initial states @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the result that interference terms appear , generating distinctive dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath58 from the plane of polarisation , through terms depending on @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "a linearly polarised photon beam of 9 gev is planned for the gluex experiment at jlab @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to adapt this beam for photons over the range 1 to 2.5 gev / c .",
    "there is an excellent prospect that this would identify individual @xmath4 and @xmath5 states cleanly .",
    "the alternative ( or a complementary experiment ) is to use so - called radiative return in @xmath6 scattering using polarised electrons .",
    "one hard photon is radiated from the initial state and the surviving @xmath6 pair interacts via a photon to generate @xmath60 final states .",
    "it is desirable to use both linearly and longitudinally polarised electrons , to distinguish clearly between @xmath61 and @xmath62 decays of resonances .",
    "so far , the discussion has centred on light mesons and baryons .",
    "there has , of course , been spectacular progress on the spectroscopy of charmed mesons ( @xmath48 and @xmath63-mesons ) and baryons and the family of states with hidden charm , @xmath64 , etc .",
    "b - factory data measure the spins of hyperon states from charmed baryon decays ; this has contributed strongly to identifying several charmed baryons and also to identifying several @xmath65 states .",
    "data from decays of @xmath66-mesons is contributing to the study of charmed mesons , and also the study of light @xmath67 states and hybrid candidates such as @xmath68 .",
    "lattice calculations are easier for heavier quarks .",
    "if the spectroscopy of these states could be extended to broad states and radial excitations , the spectrum would be easier to compare with lattice calculations .",
    "but presently such data seem a remote prospect .",
    "my essential message is that spectroscopy of light mesons and baryons is a practical proposition over a relatively short time - scale .",
    "perhaps , with this extra information , the spectroscopy of charmed states would become clearer - at least one could ask different questions .",
    "in 1989 , david axen and i made a detailed study of a possible experiment on @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 spectroscopy @xcite using a polarised target .",
    "this paper is not available on - line ; copies are available from the authors .",
    "an outline of the contents of the paper will be given here .",
    "it was written in the context of the @xmath72-factory being discussed at the time .",
    "it considered 15 readily accessible @xmath73 reactions .",
    "the study assumed a detector close to @xmath21 acceptance and good @xmath74 detection .",
    "it showed that it is realistic to increase bubble chamber statistics by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the design of the polarised target is simplified greatly if the detector is used without a large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the orientation of the target spin may then be manipulated simply by means of holding coils of @xmath75 t. a target length of 4 cm is realistic and a diameter @xmath76 cm ; the holding coils then have dimensions @xmath77 cm larger than the target in each direction .",
    "the holding field bends charged particles by modest amounts , but trajectories can be reconstructed iteratively .",
    "such a target operated at triumf in the late 1980 s and an operating temperature of @xmath78k was achieved .",
    "it may be possible to improve on that today . under those conditions ,",
    "the relaxation time of the target polarisation was typically 4 days .",
    "the initial polarisation which was achieved was @xmath79 .",
    "the beam needs to enter along the cryostat of the polarised target .",
    "this cryostat needs to be withdrawn from the detector from time to time into a very uniform field of @xmath80 , where the target can be polarised by the usual techniques .",
    "table 1 shows a selection of @xmath81 reactions which should be straightforward from a polarised target without a magnetic field .",
    "column 3 shows the number of kinematic constraints which are available if momenta are not measured .",
    "it is assumed that photons are detected with the energy and position resolution of typical csi or baf@xmath82 detectors today .",
    "the energies and directions of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( from @xmath86 ) are reconstructed fully .",
    "the @xmath87 may be detected via @xmath88 or @xmath89 with similar efficiency and resolution .",
    "[ table 1 ]    .easy channels for baryon spectroscopy ; the upper part of the table assumes particle momenta are unmeasured , the lower part assumes neutron time - of - flight is measured . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     it is of the greatest importance to obtain data at the lowest available beam momenta .",
    "the ps172 polarised target ran as low as 360 mev / c @xmath90 1910 mev mass .",
    "the intention was to run the crystal barrel experiment likewise at 750 mev / c and with 360 mev / c at the target centre after energy loss .",
    "however , lear closed before the allocated beam time was delivered to the experiment , with the result that the lowest momentum was 600 mev / c @xmath90 1962 mev . since there is a cluster of resonances in the mass range 1920 to 2050 mev , this was a serious loss to the experiment .    for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the analysis is already very tightly constrained for @xmath91 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these partial waves appear in seven sets of data : differential cross sections and polarisations in @xmath92 @xcite @xcite , and crystal barrel data on @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "phase information on other @xmath98 comes from their interferences with these states in @xmath99 and @xmath100 channels ( and @xmath101 ) .",
    "polarisation for these channels would make the partial - wave analysis completely unambiguous .",
    "incidentally , the data and analysis programmes and fitting parameters are publicly available on cds from sarantsev or myself .",
    "partial waves are expressed in tensor algebra .",
    "an important cross - check on programmes is that all partial waves have been shown to be orthogonal when integrated over phase space .    for @xmath102",
    ", the polarisation information from @xmath92 already makes the current @xmath67 spectrum almost complete and rather well defined , except for @xmath103 , where overlap between @xmath4 and @xmath5 states causes confusion . for the other two sets of quantum numbers , the situation is presently not nearly so well defined , because of the lack of any polarisation data .",
    "results are consistent with spectra close to those of the other two families , but several states are missing and there is significant flexibility in the solutions . indeed",
    "two solutions exist for @xmath25 and @xmath26 partial waves for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , though one solution is significantly better .",
    "simulations with current data show that polarisation information on @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 channels would make the analyses of @xmath67 states completely unambiguous .    for the @xmath107 channel",
    ", there is the possibility that the @xmath32 @xmath112 channel could contribute .",
    "[ this is forbidden from initial @xmath3 states with @xmath113 and 0 in all other cases ] .",
    "there is currently no evidence for @xmath112 @xmath32 , but that needs confirmation .",
    "this proposed experiment is not part of the panda programme at fair @xcite which will run with @xmath114 from 1.5 gev / c to 15 gev / c on liquid hydrogen .",
    "it would however be feasible at the lower momentum ring flair if there is physical space to accomodate a large detector .",
    "the existing crystal barrel detector is adequate for the task .",
    "a beam intensity of a few @xmath115 is needed with a trigger on all neutral final states .",
    "other detectors have charged particle detection , which does not survive in the present incarnation of the crystal barrel . in reactions with charged pions in the final state",
    ", @xmath116 is the relevant quantum number rather than @xmath117 .",
    "accordingly , there are interferences between @xmath104 and @xmath22 states , providing very delicate cross - checks on parameters of resonances in these two systems .",
    "there is a difference of opinion between experimental groups as to whether to do so - called energy independent analysis or energy dependent analysis . in the former case ,",
    "amplitudes are fitted freely in magnitude and phase in every mass bin . in the latter case",
    ", all partial waves are parametrised with analytic forms . in practice",
    "this means breit - wigner resonances plus backgrounds linear in @xmath118 , if needed .",
    "the problem with the latter is that one is actively putting resonances into the analysis , rather than ` deducing ' them from the behaviour of amplitudes on the argand diagram .",
    "the converse problem with energy independent analysis is that it is theoretically impossible without polarisation information . in one bin , there is only one piece of information : a differential cross section .",
    "it is impossible in principle to derive both magnitudes and phases of all amplitudes .",
    "energy independent analysis therefore proceeds by parametrising some well known resonances with breit - wigner amplitudes , and using them as interferometers to determine other partial waves .",
    "this works well for the @xmath119 and @xmath120 , whose parameters are well known .",
    "however , for other resonances there are problems .",
    "one example will suffice .",
    "it is common practice to use the @xmath121 as an interferometer .",
    "however , one usually finds with good data that the @xmath122 is produced with it .",
    "its line - shape is not well known , because of lack of data on the dominant @xmath123 channel ; it overlaps significantly with @xmath121 .",
    "worse , it is known to couple strongly to @xmath124 .",
    "the sub - threshold continuation of this channel can introduce serious distortions in what is fitted as @xmath121 .",
    "the advantage of energy dependent analysis is that data can be fitted simultaneously from a set of reactions . in energy",
    "independent analysis , this constraint is lost unless constraints from other data are imposed by fixing resonance mass , width and/or branching ratios . when a weak signal is analysed , this type of constraint is important . for the case of multi - body final states ,",
    "e.g. @xmath21 , a combination with analysis of 2-body channels is the only reliable approach .",
    "experience in both @xmath16 and @xmath3 analyses is that the constraint of analyticity plays a vital role , even when polarisation data are available .",
    "if this constraint is not applied , partial waves rapidly deviate from analyticity .",
    "one is instantly in a quick - sand of ambiguities .",
    "cross - talk develops between partial waves , making it difficult to separate related partial waves , e.g. @xmath125 , @xmath50 , @xmath126 etc , and likewise @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , etc .",
    "results which deviate significantly from analyticity can not be believed .",
    "a further difficulty is that energy independent analysis requires literally thousands of parameters : magnitudes and phases of all amplitudes in every bin .",
    "the converse situation in energy dependent analysis is that one must be careful to explore the maximum possible variation of @xmath118-dependence . for resonances ,",
    "this is little problem in principle .",
    "a breit - wigner amplitude of constant width is appropriate unless one encounters thresholds .",
    "if these thresholds are sharp , they are easily accomodated by the flatt ' e form @xmath130,\\ ] ] for the two - channel case . here",
    "@xmath20 are coupling constants and @xmath119 are phase - space factors @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is momentum in the decay channel .",
    "below threshold , @xmath133 needs to be continued analytically or by means of a dispersion relation . in the numerator",
    ", @xmath134 is a centrifugal barrier factor needed in most partial waves ; form factors usually have negligible effect over the widths of known resonances .",
    "complications arise however where the threshold opens for production of a final state with significant width , e.g. @xmath135 .",
    "there is still a well defined prescription : @xmath136 needs to be integrated over the phase space of the exit channel .",
    "in addition , @xmath137 needs modification to @xmath138 where @xmath139 evaluation of the dispersion integral needs to be done only once if the form of @xmath140 is known , but the program then needs to interpolate in a table of values ; in practice this is trivial .",
    "it is sometimes argued that ` backgrounds ' may be needed in every partial wave .",
    "this point needs clarification .",
    "left - hand cuts for each partial wave generate slowly varying driving forces .",
    "however , in the @xmath141 approach , these are isolated in the @xmath142 function .",
    "the denominator @xmath48 contains the phase information concerning resonances .",
    "it is not necessary to add separately left - hand cuts as ` backgrounds ' : these are already built into resonances .",
    "the classic example is chew - low theory @xcite , where nucleon exchange drives the @xmath143 and alters its line - shape from a simple breit - wigner by an amount which can in practice be used to make an accurate determination of the @xmath144 coupling constant .",
    "there may of course be broad components , e.g. hybrids or molecular states , in addition to the regular @xmath145 states , and one needs to keep a watchful eye open for such broad components .",
    "the virtue of energy dependent analysis is that the number of fitted parameters is reduced to a few per partial wave .",
    "this has the advantage that programmes run quickly .",
    "the downside is that one must be careful not to miss something , requiring time to explore the options .",
    "this procedure must be viewed as a process of successive approximation .",
    "the proof of the pudding is in the results .",
    "energy dependent analysis has dug out of crystal barrel data a regular array of resonances .",
    "their star - rating can be investigated by varying their parameters and dropping them completely from the analysis to see what happens .",
    "analyses below the @xmath3 threshold have mostly been done with energy independent analysis .",
    "the result , however , is a number of missing states which can be confidently predicted from the quark model , notably low spin states with @xmath146 , @xmath128 and @xmath147 .",
    "my opinion is that these would emerge with judicious use of analytic forms for amplitudes . that needs to be done with existing data .",
    "there is one remaining issue which goes beyond current partial wave analyses .",
    "the @xmath32 isospin 2 amplitude may contribute , though there is presently no evidence for this .",
    "if it does , its clebsch - gordan coefficients differ between @xmath148 and @xmath149 final states , for example .",
    "to investigate this possibility , it is desirable to take some data for the reactions in the bottom part of table 1",
    ". this can be done from a liquid hydrogen target using @xmath150 kinematic fits for these reactions .",
    "the alternative is to use a time - of - flight spectrometer , giving a 2c fit .",
    "it is technically straightforward to use a frozen - spin target in a @xmath21 detector to collect data on baryon and light - meson spectroscopy .",
    "such a program could be completed in a few years and would expand enormously the reliability and extent of available data .",
    "data on @xmath16 would strengthen the results which can be deduced from the existing photoproduction data ( plus the measurements forseen at elsa with polarised target and polarised photons ) .",
    "from such a program , it is predictable that the spectroscopy of the regular baryons and mesons could be determined completely up to 2400 - 2500 mev , i.e. over four radial excitations , which is surely sufficient to see the picture . once this spectrum is established , the door is open to uncovering glueballs with confidence in bes iii data on decays of @xmath64 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it is very likely that the outlines of the hybrid spectrum would also materialise . in meson spectroscopy , there are presently three good candidates : the well known @xmath153 with exotic quantum numbers @xmath154 , as well as two @xmath129 states @xmath155 and @xmath156 , with masses ( and decay modes ) which do not fit regular @xmath67 states .",
    "in addition the @xmath157 has decay modes characteristic of those to be associated with a hybrid ; the problem here is that the @xmath67 state expected at @xmath158 mev from the regge trajectories of fig .",
    "2(c ) is as yet unknown and could be the @xmath157 .",
    "the cost of such a program in terms of new equipment is small , and it would indeed extend the lives of existing high quality detectors . a significant effort of man - power is however required in partial wave analysis .",

    "<S> three ( or four ) straightforward experiments would contribute greatly to completing the spectroscopy of baryons and light mesons . in the baryon sector , data are needed on inelastic reactions from a polarised target with @xmath0 and @xmath1 beams up to @xmath2 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> similar data are needed in the light meson sector for @xmath3 interactions in the momentum range 0.3 to 2 gev / c . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> valuable information is to be obtained from longitudinal ( l ) and sideways ( s ) target polarisations as well as the conventional normal ( n ) polarisation . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons in the mass range 1 to 2.4 gev / c could probably be separated either by diffractive dissociation of transversely polarised photons or by @xmath6 radiative return experiments using transversely and longitudinally polarised electrons .    </S>",
