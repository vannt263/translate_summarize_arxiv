    "displacement mechanism in porous media plays significant role in several industrial and environmental processes , such as secondary and tertiary oil recovery @xcite , hydrology @xcite , chromatography @xcite , aquifers @xcite and geodynamics @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , over the last one decades and half researchers and scientists face challenges to capture the environmental @xmath0 and store them for longer period in order to reduce the amount of carbon released in the air .",
    "this also involves the displacement in porous rock .",
    "looking into the vast area of industrial and real life applications it is very important to study such multiphase flow problems in porous media . in all such displacement",
    "processes a convective instability takes place when a less viscous fluid displaces another fluid of higher viscosity .",
    "these instability patterns looks like fingers - hence called viscous fingering ( vf ) instability or the saffman - taylor instability @xcite ( sometimes also called hill s instability @xcite ) .",
    "researchers have investigated about the dynamics of these instabilities over several decades for both the immiscible and miscible fluids . in the case of the former surface tension acts as a stabilization factor , whereas in the miscible fluid dispersion plays an important role in the stabilization of the system .",
    "motivated by the pioneering work of saffman and taylor @xcite several authors carried out various lsa @xcite to capture the onset of instability and also performed nonlinear simulations @xcite to analyze the dynamic pattern of the instability .",
    "tan and homsy @xcite presented lsa for vf instability in classical single interface fluid displacement using quasi - steady - state - approximation ( qssa ) method and initial value problem ( ivp ) approach .",
    "following the work of tan and homsy @xcite , kim and choi @xcite performed lsa using qssa in a similarity transformation domain and a spectral analysis .",
    "it has been shown that the results obtained from their analyses are physically more relevant than those of qssa , and are also in accordance with the ivp results .",
    "pramanik and mishra @xcite carried out self - similar qssa ( ss - qssa ) to investigate the onset of instability for the single interface vf as well as displacement of localized fluid of finite extent both in the presence and absence of the korteweg stresses .",
    "their analyses determine the effect of width of the finite fluid on the onset of vf instability .",
    "dimensionless formulation of the mathematical model is an integral and indispensable part of the theoretical investigations . in principle ,",
    "such formulations are not unique and they depend upon the choice of the characteristic scales based on their presence in the model and/or the interest of the particular study .",
    "two different types of characteristic scales are mainly used in the literature of miscible viscous fingering instability .",
    "one uses the diffusive length @xmath1 and time @xmath2 as the characteristic length and time scales,@xcite whereas in the other convective length ( @xmath3 ) and time @xmath4 @xcite are used for the same . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the axial dispersion coefficient and the uniform displacement speed of the fluid in a hele - shaw cell of width @xmath3 .",
    "the latter formulation induces explicit dependence of the fluid dispersion in terms of the dimensionless parameter pclet number , pe , which is the ratio of the convective to the diffusive fluxes caused by the compositional gradients in the fluid .",
    "however , in the former explicit influence of fluid dispersion on miscible viscous fingering is hard to incorporate through linear stability analysis .",
    "tan and homsy @xcite performed a linear stability analysis to analyze the influence of pe on the miscible radial source flow displacement in porous media .",
    "this study shows the existence of a critical pclet number , pe@xmath7 , below which diffusion is large enough such that all the perturbations remain stable .",
    "zimmerman and homsy @xcite carried out nonlinear simulations using the characteristic length of the model to investigate the influence of anisotropic dispersion in miscible vf .",
    "their investigation elucidate that for large values of pe one dimensional averaged concentration profile at large time remains invariant with pe and anisotropic dispersion .",
    "yang and yortsos @xcite presented an asymptotic analysis to understand the effect of pe on miscible vf in stokes flow regime between two parallel plates or in a cylindrical capillary .",
    "they determined a sharp upper bound for the pe number below which the transverse averaging and the conventional convection - diffusion equation associated with the miscible hele - shaw flow is valid .",
    "discussion of the above - mentioned literature reveals the fact that rigorous investigation about explicit dependence of fluid dispersion or pe number on the miscible displacement is important in the context of vf in a hele - shaw cell .",
    "as mentioned earlier this aspect of miscible vf has been addressed by some of the researchers in the context of linear stability analysis for radial source flow @xcite , nonlinear simulations for rectilinear displacement of flat interface @xcite and localized circular fluid @xcite . however , to the best of the authors knowledge , investigation about the effect of pe on miscible rectilinear displacement in the linear regime was not attempted before .",
    "we follow a dimensionless formulation taking the convective characteristic length and time scales that incorporates pe as the reciprocal of the dimensionless axial dispersion .",
    "the aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of fluid dispersion on the miscible vf instability through self - similar linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "next , nonlinear simulations have been performed using fourier spectral method @xcite to investigate the possible effect of fluid dispersion on the interaction of fingers in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this is followed by comparison of the linear regime results of the rectilinear displacements with those of the radial source flow and the fully nonlinear simulations .",
    "it is clear that a slow diffusion mechanism gives rise to steep concentration gradient , which leads to intense fingering instability as diffusion acts as a stabilization factor in miscible fluid systems .",
    "however , it is well established both theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite that in the presence of steep concentration gradient a non - conventional stress , called the korteweg stress @xcite , appears in miscible fluids .",
    "these gradient stresses stabilize the vf instability .",
    "thus , two opposite phenomena take place out of the same physical consequence of steep concentration gradient that may lead to interplay between these two effects .",
    "this gives rise to another important question about miscible vf instability , how a destabilizing and a stabilizing force resulting from slow diffusion co - exist during the displacement of miscible fluids in a hele - shaw cell ?",
    "these fundamental questions are addressed in the present study and we try to present a compact qualitative and quantitative analyses in this paper .    the paper is organized in the following manner . the mathematical formulation of the problem is presented in sec . [",

    "<S> influence of fluid dispersion on the saffman - taylor instability in miscible fluids has been investigated both in the linear and nonlinear regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the convective characteristic scales are used for the dimensionless formulation that incorporates pclet number ( pe ) into the governing equations as a measure for the fluid dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> a linear stability analysis ( lsa ) has been performed in a similarity transformation domain using the quasi - steady - state approximation . </S>",
    "<S> lsa results show that systems with large pe become more unstable and the onset of instability occurs earlier compared to the case when pe is smaller . </S>",
    "<S> variations of the most unstable wave number and the cut - off wave number with pe have been analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> fourier spectral method has been used for the numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear system . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the wave numbers of the unstable modes increase with pe . </S>",
    "<S> influence of the anisotropic dispersion on the onset in both the linear and nonlinear regimes has been analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> large transverse diffusivity increases the length scale of the fingers quickly and merges the fingers to generate coarser fingers . </S>",
    "<S> finally the combined effect of the korteweg stress and pe in the linear regime has been perused . in the presence of </S>",
    "<S> the korteweg stresses and depending upon various flow parameters , a fluid system with larger pe exhibits smaller instantaneous growth rate than with smaller pe , which is a counter - intuitive result . </S>"
