    "when the radiation formation length becomes comparable to the distance over which the multiple scattering becomes important , the probability of the bremsstrahlung process will be suppressed .",

    "the energy @xmath1 is very high even for heavy elements : @xmath6  tev for tungsten and @xmath7  tev for lead .",

    "in contrast to the radiation process , where the lpm effect can be observed in soft part of spectrum , for observation of the effect in the pair creation process the energy @xmath12 is needed .",

    "this approach not only permits to consider simultaneously both the coherent and incoherent mechanisms of pair creation by a photon or photon emission from high energy electrons but also gives insight on influence of the lpm effect on the considered mechanisms of pair creation or radiation in oriented crystals .",

    "the field action excludes the lpm effect .",
    "as opposed to the pair creation process where the coherent process is suppressed exponentially at the low photon energy , the coherent contribution to the radiation intensity is very essential for any electron energy . because of this the relative contribution of the lpm effect into the total radiation intensity ( the inverse radiation length ) @xmath22 ( @xmath22 is obtained from @xmath13 by substitution of the probability @xmath15 in eq.([1a ] ) by the corresponding radiation intensity ) is much smaller than in the pair creation probability : in tungsten crystal ( axis @xmath0 ) it has the maximum @xmath23% at the electron energy @xmath24  gev for t=100 k and @xmath25% at @xmath26  gev for t=293 k @xcite .",

    "<S> the spectral distribution of electron - positron pair created by photon and the spectral distribution of photons radiated from high - energy electron in an oriented single crystal is calculated using the method which permits inseparable consideration both of the coherent and incoherent mechanisms of two relevant processes . </S>",
    "<S> the method includes the action of field of axis ( or plane ) as well as the multiple scattering of radiating electron or particles of the created pair ( the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of scattering on the coherent mechanism and the influence of field on the incoherent mechanism are analyzed . in tungsten , </S>",
