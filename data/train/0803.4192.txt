    "ads / cft correspondence  @xcite has provided us with a new avenue to compute observables in strongly interacting gauge theories via weakly coupled gravitational descriptions . even though the correspondence is still a conjecture ,",
    "many nontrivial computations have been performed and checked to be consistent .",
    "one of the most important applications , and also challenges , would be to analyze real qcd in nature using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "recently , there proposed a holographic model of qcd by sakai and sugimoto , where the non - abelian chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking is geometrically realized via a d4/d8/@xmath0 configuration  @xcite .",
    "the model predictions for the meson spectrum and the couplings between them compare well with experiments with a good accuracy .",
    "baryons in this model are also investigated in  @xcite . moreover",
    ", this holographic model has an ability of predicting possible glue - ball interactions to mesons as studied in  @xcite .",
    "there are many other qcd observables that have been analyzed in this model , which show that the model is a good approximation to real qcd at least in low energy , large @xmath9-limit .    despite its success in many aspects ,",
    "this model has an apparent shortcoming that the pions are massless .",
    "this is because the quarks are massless from the construction .",
    "therefore one of the important questions is to find a deformation of the theory which corresponds to introducing bare quark masses .",
    "once we identify the deformation , we should be able to show that the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gor ) relation @xcite is satisfied , and moreover , we can compute the value of the chiral condensate of the sakai - sugimoto model through this relation .",
    "pion dynamics would be the most important in holographic qcd because the sakai - sugimoto model approaches real qcd in the low energy limit , thus the identification of the quark mass deformation in the model is indispensable .",
    "the chiral quarks appear as the lowest massless modes of the open string stretching between intersecting @xmath9 d4-branes and @xmath10 d8-branes ( or @xmath0-branes ) in the model .",
    "therefore one would naively expect that the quarks become massive if one can realize the situation where the d8 and @xmath0-branes do not intersect with the d4-branes .",
    "some of the authors  @xcite studied such local deformations near the d4-branes ( which do not deform the asymptotic configuration away from the d4-branes ) to realize the pion mass , but the quarks in this set - up are suggested to be still massless .",
    "this is in fact consistent with the proposed relation  @xcite between the classical value of action in the bulk and the partition function in cft for the ads@xmath11/cft@xmath12 correspondence , since the value of bulk field at the ads boundary is related with the strength of coupling , such as the mass , in cft .",
    "there are attempts to include d8-@xmath0-brane tachyon in the effective action to explicitly break the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , tachyon action is not reliable as there is no consistent truncation of the tachyon theory to low energy .",
    "furthermore , possible relation to the original sakai - sugimoto brane configuration is not obvious .    in this work ,",
    "we propose deformations of the sakai - sugimoto model which correspond to the introduction of the quark mass .",
    "our deformations have additional d - branes away from the original confining @xmath9 d4-branes , which still have a reasonable field theory interpretation .",
    "the original sakai - sugimoto model is restored once these additional d - branes are moved to spatial infinity in the bulk . in the field theory view - point ,",
    "our idea is rather similar to the technicolor model  @xcite , so our construction can be thought of as a holographic realization of technicolor model . in the minimal technicolor model , we have an additional sector to the original qcd , which contains new techni - quarks interacting via new technicolor interactions .",
    "the quarks / techni - quarks are massless at uv , but the chiral symmetry ( the electroweak symmetry in this case ) is spontaneously broken by a techni - quark condensate driven by the strong technicolor gauge interactions .",
    "to realize qcd quark mass from this breaking , we need to introduce extended technicolor interactions between quarks and techni - quarks , in addition to the usual weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "this setup is actually close to the holographic dual of extended type technicolor model by applying the d - brane configuration of sakai - sugimoto model in @xcite .",
    "this extended gauge group can often be realized in gut type construction , where quarks and techni - quarks are in a same multiplet , and the gut gauge symmetry is broken to qcd and technicolor at some high scale . through off - diagonal massive gauge bosons ,",
    "qcd quarks get explicit bare mass term from the techni - quark condensate . from the view - point of qcd , we have a realization of explicit chiral symmetry breaking mass for the quarks .",
    "to realize this idea in our set - up , we introduce additional @xmath13 d4-branes ( we call them d4@xmath14-branes ) which are parallel to , but separated from the original @xmath9 d4-branes of qcd gauge symmetry .",
    "the gut gauge symmetry is @xmath15 when d4@xmath14-branes are on top of the original d4-branes , and it is broken to @xmath16 by a higgs mechanism via separating d4@xmath14 from d4 .",
    "massive off - diagonal gauge bosons appear as strings between d4 and d4@xmath14 .",
    "we add @xmath10 d8/@xmath17-branes as in @xcite to introduce massless quarks and techni - quarks , which are charged under the chiral symmetry @xmath18 . by assuming a strong technicolor @xmath19 dynamics on the d4@xmath14-branes , which replaces d4@xmath14-branes with the witten geometry , the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by adjoining d8/@xmath20-branes there , as in the sakai - sugimoto model but with technicolor instead of qcd .",
    "this breaking will be mediated to the qcd sector of @xmath9 d4-branes by , for example , the massive gauge bosons coming from open strings between the d4 and d4@xmath14-branes .",
    "this is expected to induce the bare masses for the qcd quarks .",
    "from the feynman graphs that would induce quark masses from a techni - quark condensate , we can easily identify the corresponding string worldsheets that mediate this phenomenon in our d - brane configuration in flat space .",
    "we consider a closed loop surrounded by d4-d8-d4@xmath14-@xmath0-branes ( see fig.[d2 ] ) and a disk _ worldsheet instanton _ whose boundary is ending on this closed loop .",
    "it is responsible for the extended technicolor interactions coupling quarks to techni - quarks . as we go to the strongly coupled field theory , or weakly coupled gravity regime , we keep track of how this worldsheet looks like in the gravity description , as we will study in sec .  [ ws ] . in the gravity dual description , where both d4 and d4@xmath14-branes are replaced by the near horizon geometry of multi center solution , we have a closed loop with the probe d8-branes only , since d8 and @xmath0-branes",
    "are smoothly connected at two throats created by the d4 and the d4@xmath14-branes ( see fig.[d4 ] ) .",
    "the previous worldsheet instanton in the weak coupling picture is now ending on this closed loop , and is understood as a leading order contribution , since this is a planar diagram with one boundary in large @xmath21 gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "we will show that this worldsheet instanton amplitude indeed induces the lowest mass perturbation that one may expect in the low energy chiral lagrangian of pions .",
    "we will also show that the gor relation is satisfied .",
    "this will be presented in detail in sec .",
    "[ ws ] .",
    "since the chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously in view of the whole gut theory , there still exist massless goldstone bosons .",
    "these modes will be localized around d4@xmath14 throat when the techni - quark condensate scale is much bigger than the qcd scale . in the gravity picture",
    ", they would correspond to the wilson line on d8 from the asymptotic boundary to the d4@xmath14 throat and again to the boundary .",
    "we have to take a limit to decouple these nambu - goldstone bosons by scaling @xmath22 first and putting d4@xmath14-branes at far uv region from the d4-branes , while keeping finite the mass of pions associated with the chiral symmetry breaking realized by @xmath9 d4-branes .",
    "also , it seems complicated to analyze multi - center solutions of d4-branes explicitly .",
    "it is difficult to realize flavor dependent quark mass in this set - up , too .",
    "we then consider introducing @xmath13 d6-branes instead of the d4@xmath14-branes , which is free of these difficulties .",
    "this deformation keeps the essential idea of introducing @xmath13 d4-branes , but has great advantages of computability without taking any subtle limits .",
    "therefore , we can compute the quark mass as well as the pion mass more rigorously , and consequently we can estimate the value of the chiral condensate of the sakai - sugimoto model via the gor relation .",
    "we will also see that the quark masses derived from our results with the pion mass as an input will be around @xmath23 mev , which happens to be quite close to the real qcd .",
    "the numerical value of the computed chiral condensate is close to the results of lattice qcd .",
    "this will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sqm ] .    in the next section ,",
    "we first give the field theoretical interpretation of introducing the @xmath13 d4-branes and describe the feynman graphs which induce the quark masses .",
    "then we study the corresponding string worldsheet instantons both in the d - brane configuration in flat space and in the holographic dual gravity description , and estimate the quark and pion masses . after explaining difficulties of precise computations , we instead introduce @xmath13 d6-branes and study the corresponding interpretation in qcd side in sec .",
    "[ sqm ] , where we carry out explicit computations of quark and pion masses .",
    "we show in detail that the up and down quarks have masses around @xmath23 mev in our model .",
    "it is important to stress that we can also realize flavor dependent quark masses with our d6-branes .",
    "since our idea has a field theoretical interpretation which can be applied to a wide range of holographic qcd models , we apply our idea to a holographic approach of qcd proposed by kruczenski _ et.al _",
    "@xcite in sec.[d4d6case ] .",
    "we give a detail about how our idea works in their model . in sec .",
    "[ cd ] , we conclude with discussions .",
    "in the sakai - sugimoto model with @xmath9 d4 , @xmath10 d8 and @xmath10 @xmath0-branes , qcd gauge bosons are realized on the d4-branes and the chiral flavor symmetry @xmath24 is realized as the gauge symmetry on the @xmath10 d8 and @xmath10 @xmath0-branes .",
    "the left ( right ) handed massless quarks are localized at the intersection between the d4-branes and the d8- ( @xmath0- ) branes . in the holographic dual description , the near horizon geometry of the d4-branes develops a throat which naturally explains confinement . the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is nicely realized since the d8 and @xmath0-branes are connected smoothly at the throat .",
    "if we introduce additional d4-branes ( d4@xmath14-branes ) which are parallel to but separated from the original d4-branes , the chiral symmetry is also broken by the d4@xmath14-branes in the holographic dual description of strong technicolor dynamics on the d4@xmath14-branes . since there are massive gauge bosons from the open strings stretching between the d4 and d4@xmath14-branes , the effect of the chiral symmetry breaking at the d4@xmath14-branes will be mediated into qcd sector on the d4-branes and the quark mass terms are resultantly induced .",
    "we will pursue this idea in this section .",
    "we first describe the d - brane configuration and study the low energy theory on the d - branes .",
    "the d - brane configuration which we now consider consists of d4 , d8 and @xmath0-branes ( see fig.[d1 ] )     ( -164,0)d4 ( -64,0)d4@xmath14 ( -12,78)d8 ( -12,22)@xmath0    and is summarized in the table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the radial directions in @xmath25 and in @xmath26 from the d4-branes are denoted as @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , and the d6-brane configuration in the d4-brane geometry is solved in their paper . the asymptotic behavior for @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 is a some large value ) , is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the asymptotic distance between the d4- and the d6-branes which is related to the bare quark mass @xmath33 as @xmath34 and @xmath35 is related to the value of condensate is used in  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath36 the mass of the pion , which is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with the breaking of the rotation symmetry of the @xmath26-plane , is also computed in their paper @xmath37    we now introduce our technicolor @xmath13 d4@xmath14-branes which are parallel to , but separated from the @xmath9 d4-branes along @xmath27 with @xmath38 ( so that @xmath39 ) .",
    "let s say that the d4-branes are sitting at @xmath40 and the d4@xmath14-branes are at @xmath41 .",
    "we first treat the d4-branes as probes and consider the effects from confining d4@xmath14 dynamics . assuming the distance @xmath42 between the d4 and d4@xmath14-branes is much larger than @xmath30 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath43 , the value of @xmath28 at the position of the d4-brane @xmath40 _ induced by the presence of d4@xmath14-brane _ would be @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the contribution from the d4@xmath14-branes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 for the probe d4-branes before their gravity background is considered , this would serve as its new asymptotic distance @xmath32 from the @xmath47 branes .",
    "it is shifted from the original @xmath32 by @xmath48 .",
    "we then take the gravity background for our d4-branes , and we have @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "therefore we see that the quark mass in qcd sector on the d4-branes is shifted as @xmath51 where we have used the w - boson mass @xmath52 of the d4-d4@xmath14 string .",
    "the mass of the pion in the qcd sector is read again @xmath37    in the above computation , we used the holographic dual description and used the fact that the pseudo nambu - goldstone wavefunction in qcd sector is localized at @xmath40 region .",
    "we can also study the quark mass from a field theoretical point of view , since introducing the d4@xmath14-branes has an interpretation of introducing a techni gauge theory .",
    "the invariance under the rotation in the @xmath26-plane is broken by the d4@xmath14-branes and the breaking effects are communicated into the qcd sector on the d4-branes by , for example , massive gauge bosons which come from the open strings connecting the d4- and d4@xmath14-branes .",
    "we then have a feynman graph similar to fig.[w1 ] and can compute the quark mass after replacing @xmath53 with its condensate @xmath54 . after a careful calculation ,",
    "the quark mass is computed as a consistent value with up to a numerical factor .",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "the d6-brane configuration is obtained by solving the equation of motion computed from the dbi action for the d6-brane in the d4-brane geometry .",
    "this means that the pion mass terms are induced in the dbi action because of the d4@xmath14-branes , on the contrary to the sakai - sugimoto model where the dbi action does not have a mass term for the pion .",
    "this is understood from the string world sheets .",
    "the string world sheet which corresponds to the graph in fig.[w1 ] is not a worldsheet instanton , but just a disk amplitude whose boundary is on the d6-branes .",
    "the minimal worldsheet area is vanishing .",
    "if the boundary passes through the two throats created by the d4 and d4@xmath14-branes , this disk worldsheet picks up the effects on the d4@xmath14-branes and communicate them into the d4-branes . since the dbi action is computed from this infinitely small disk worldsheet ( which is not a worldsheet instanton ) , the mass terms for the pion appear in the dbi action in the present case .",
    "in this paper , we propose the deformations of the sakai - sugimoto model to generate the quark masses .",
    "our considerations are motivated by extended technicolor theories where we break chiral symmetry via introducing a technicolor sector .",
    "we systematically trace the mass deformations in different descriptions , that is , weak coupling d - branes setting and the corresponding holographic gravity description . in the field theory side",
    ", the chiral condensate in the technicolor sector is mediated to the qcd sector , generating the quark masses .",
    "one then expects the massive quarks will yield the massive pion .",
    "moreover , the pion and the quark masses are expected to obey the gor relation from the chiral lagrangian consideration .",
    "to _ derive _ the gor relation from first principles , we should have a good control on the strong coupling dynamics of qcd . relying on holographic principle , our analysis verifies the gor relation impressively .",
    "furthermore , we find a good numerical agreement of the chiral condensate with the experimental or lattice results .    in our construction , by introducing additional technicolor branes ,",
    "a novel mechanism of worldsheet instanton gives us a controlled contribution to the quark mass deformation . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the @xmath9 color branes are replaced by a curved geometry , and the corresponding worldsheet instanton is now dressed by the wilson line of the probe d8-brane gauge field via worldsheet boundary interactions .",
    "this results in an additional term in the d8-brane effective action corresponding to the mass deformation of the chiral lagrangian of the pions .",
    "we realize our idea with different types of d - branes , the d4@xmath14- and @xmath47-branes .",
    "the former has a clear field theory interpretation in terms of a gut - like extended technicolor theory , while the latter case is more tractable in actual calculations .",
    "moreover , it allows us flavor - dependent quark mass terms .",
    "qcd @xmath55 angle can also be introduced easily by turning on @xmath56 in the background .",
    "based on these brane settings , we have verified that the deformations indeed correspond to the lowest mass perturbation in the chiral lagrangian of pions via a novel mechanism of worldsheet instantons .",
    "we also have the gor relation satisfied , and from this relation we have extracted the quark masses and the chiral condensate of the sakai - sugimoto model for the first time , which happens to be surprisingly close to the lattice qcd estimate .",
    "we expect that the progress made in this paper can push the sakai - sugimoto model towards a more realistic nonperturbative description of qcd .",
    "we hope it may inspire more comparisons with the experimental or lattice qcd results . for example , we may expect the worldsheet instanton will also affect other hadron spectrum and their dynamics simply because both mesons and baryons are excitations of the quarks . as shown in @xcite , there is a difficulty in fitting both the baryon and meson spectrum well at the same time in sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "it is then interesting to see if our mass deformation would help to resolve the issue .",
    "there are many issues in lattice qcd or nuclear physics which call for a reliable and calculable qcd model with non - zero quark masses .",
    "for example , the mass shift of the pions in a finite temperature or in quark - gluon plasma phase is of much interest .",
    "these can be done only with the models with non - zero quark mass as the one we proposed .",
    "the study of renormalization of the value of chiral condensate is also interesting .",
    "also , lattice computations have been done in quench approximation where quarks are heavy .",
    "it is often stated that the sakai - sugimoto model corresponds to a quenched approximation . however , it is different from the lattice quenching of heavy quarks , because in the original sakai - sugimoto model quarks are massless .",
    "it is also hoped that our mass deformation will help the holographic qcd to address some issues like nuclear potential in nuclear physics , where the pion mass will play an important role in their dynamics .",
    "_ note added in proof : _ while we are preparing our manuscript , there appeared a paper @xcite which has some overlap with ours in discussing the mass deformation by the worldsheet instantons .",

    "<S> we propose several quark mass deformations of the holographic model of massless qcd using the d4/d8/@xmath0-brane configuration proposed by sakai and sugimoto . </S>",
    "<S> the deformations are based on introducing additional d4- or d6-branes away from the qcd d4 branes . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is similar to extended technicolor theories , where the chiral symmetry breaking by additional d - branes is mediated to qcd to induce non - zero quark masses . in the d - brane picture as well as the holographic dual gravity description , </S>",
    "<S> the quark and the pion masses are generated by novel worldsheet instantons with finite area . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation , and find the value of the chiral condensate in the sakai - sugimoto model .    </S>",
