    "the higgs divergent radiative corrections indicate that the standard model ( sm ) is an effective field theory , valid up to a scale @xmath5 .",
    "the excellent agreement between the theory and experiment fixes this scale on a few tev . above this scale a new theory must solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "one possible solution to this problem was recently given by the called little higgs models @xcite .",
    "in these models , the standard model higgs particle is viewed as a pseudo - goldstone boson of a new global symmetry group . in a first stage , this symmetry is spontaneously broken and the higgs is a massless particle . a new `` collective '' symmetry breaking gives a mass to the higgs boson .",
    "the net result is that the new particles and couplings cancel exactly the awful behavior of the standard model divergent diagrams giving a light mass to the higgs fields .",
    "recently , several proposals for `` little higgs '' models have been made .",
    "their main difference are the choice of the new global symmetry .",
    "one explicit model @xcite , with fewer number of new parameters as possible , was named as the `` littlest higgs model '' ( here after lhm ) .",
    "it is constructed using an @xmath6 coset : a gauged @xmath7 is broken to its subgroup @xmath8 . a detailed study of this model was done in reference @xcite and some more general reviews are given in @xcite .",
    "the earlier versions of the lhm presented some difficulties . from the analysis of the electroweak precision constraints it was shown @xcitethat a fine tuning was necessary in order to get a higgs mass of @xmath9 gev .",
    "the main problem could be related to the large top yukawa coupling that generates instabilities in the higgs potential .",
    "some modifications were introduced such as a new single u(1 ) @xcite and t - parity @xcite .",
    "the important point in these extentions is that the scale parameter that fixes the lhm could be as low as @xmath10 gev instead of @xmath11 tev .",
    "this point re - opened the possibility of testing the lhm at the lhc energies .",
    "many proposed models predict the existence of an extra heavy neutral gauge boson , @xmath12 . these include : 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite , little higgs model @xcite , left - right symmetric models @xcite , supersymmetric breaking with an extra non - anomalous u(1 ) @xcite , superstring inspired e@xmath13 model @xcite and models with extra dimensions as kaluza - klein excitations of neutral gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "the experimental verification of these models , and alternatives like supersymmetric models , could be done by the small quantum corrections to the sm predictions and/or by the discovery of new particles .",
    "this will be the main task of the high energy and luminosity accelerators lhc and ilc .",
    "since there are many models with new interactions and particles , it will be necessary to have very clear signatures to distinguish the available models . from the experimental point of view",
    "a fundamental question is the nature and properties of the lightest particle in extended models . in the lhm",
    "this particle is a new neutral gauge boson , named @xmath14 .",
    "a simple and unique property of this model is the presence of a second , heavier , new neutral gauge boson , named @xmath15 with correlated masses .",
    "these new neutral heavy gauge bosons ( named in general here as @xmath16 ) could be found in the next generation of high energy colliders : hadron @xmath17 hadron @xmath18and @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) .",
    "these topics have been studied by many authors during the last years @xcite .",
    "it is expected that at the lhc energies the new neutral gauge bosons will give detectable signals or new mass limits for the @xmath16 and that at future high energy electron - positron colliders it will be possible to study its properties , in details .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the future colliders will be set to the highest possible values , consistent with technical feasibility and cost limits .",
    "however it is also possible that the masses of the new particles will be below the initially designed collider energy .",
    "another fundamental point is that the little higgs models , as well as practically all other extended model with a new neutral gauge boson , have at least two unknown parameters : the new mass value and some mixing parameter(s ) in the coupling with standard matter .",
    "the optimistic view that a new neutral current experimental signal will be seen at the lhc and more precisely studied at a new lepton collider will probably show that many extended model could account for this signal .",
    "but the lhm has another fundamental feature : a second , heavier , new neutral gauge boson . as cross sections at the resonant energies",
    "have the highest possible values it will be necessary to recalibrate the whole collider in order to fix its cm energy at the new resonant mass .",
    "although physically well motivated , this procedure could be time - consuming and costly .",
    "it is important to have simple alternative signatures in order to show model differences already in the initial collider working period .",
    "earlier works on the lhm have started from the possibility of a first experimental signature for new gauge interactions at the lhc and then the leptonic colliders were considered at a fixed center of mass energy equal to the new boson mass values @xcite .",
    "the main point proposed in this paper is that it is not necessary to wait until the lepton collider energy could be fixed at the mass of the new neutral gauge boson in order to get its properties and exclude some models .",
    "we will consider new bounds and model differences of new neutral gauge bosons for different @xmath21 values , taking @xmath22 , both for polarized and unpolarized beams .",
    "the other difference with previous works @xcite is that we will consider as a signature for new neutral gauge bosons the process @xmath23 , where the final state photon is a hard photon with @xmath24 gev @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss these two main signatures for electron - positron colliders that can point to model differences : asymmetries in the production of fermion pairs and the production of a single hard photon associated with new heavy neutral gauge bosons .",
    "total cross sections will be shown to present detectable effects .",
    "the fermion pair production allows one to find new limits that can be model dependent for @xmath25 and the hard photon production allows one to study the region for @xmath26 .",
    "we concentrate our attention first on the lightest neutral gauge boson of the lhm - @xmath27 .",
    "the present experimental limit is @xmath28 gev obtained by @xcite and is somewhat model dependent .",
    "the other neutral gauge boson @xmath29 is heavier , with a mass of the order @xmath30 . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the models considered in this paper . in section 3",
    "we present our results on the asymmetries .",
    "the new bounds on the lhm parameters are displayed in section 4 , and a new signature for the @xmath14 and @xmath31 bosons in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we give our final conclusions .",
    "in order to compare the lhm predictions with other models we will employ the canonical @xmath32 superstring inspired @xmath33 models @xcite , symmetric left - right model ( slrm ) and mirror left - right model ( mlrm ) @xcite . as our main interest is the detection of new gauge bosons",
    ", we will consider only their coupling to ordinary matter .",
    "new particle states must also be coupled to new gauge bosons but this will introduce new parameters and will make the estimates more model dependent in the order hand this will demand also a more sophisticated experimental analysis .    the general form of the interaction lagrangian involving only ordinary fermions and extra neutral gauge bosons is given by    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the vector and vector - axial couplings .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings to the ordinary matter are the same as the sm ones .    for the lhm , according to reference @xcite , the new neutral gauge bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 couple with ordinary matter with mixing angles @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the couplings are shown in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the constant couplings group , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are hypercharges and @xmath45 , are combinations of the coupling parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    .",

    "the angular asymmetry is an interesting variable because it is strongly dependent on the couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the leptonic asymmetries for the process @xmath49 presented in @xcite were calculated for @xmath50 where @xmath1 is the lightest new neutral boson mass . in this paper , we consider the same channel but for new gauge boson mass regions below and above the collider energy . in all calculations ,",
    "each final lepton was required to be detected within the azimuthal angle range @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angle of either of the final fermions with respect to the direction of the electron beam .",
    "this cut corresponds roughly to the detector limitations . for the lhm ,",
    "the total width @xmath53 was calculated considering the main contributions from pairs of ordinary charged and neutral fermions and @xmath54-@xmath38-@xmath55 couplings . for the @xmath56 width",

    "a second point that can show interesting properties of a new fundamental interaction mechanism is the associated production of a general @xmath16 and a hard photon in the process @xmath115 @xcite .",
