    "hi 21 cm aperture synthesis observations of nearby spiral galaxies is a mature field with over three decades of history ",
    "probably something of the order of a thousand galaxies have already been imaged .",
    "however observers have tended to focus on bright ( @xmath3 l@xmath6 ) galaxies with hi masses @xmath7 m@xmath2 .",
    "hi observations of faint dwarf galaxies ( m@xmath8 ) generally require comparatively long integration times , and such galaxies have hence not been studied in similar numbers .",
    "while there have been some systematic hi surveys of dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) , these have generally been restricted to the brighter ( m@xmath9 ) dwarfs .    in hierarchical models of galaxy formation , nearby dwarf galaxies would , in some ways , be analogs of the primordial building blocks of large galaxies .",
    "a systematic hi survey of the faintest dwarf galaxies could provide data that would be useful for a diverse range of studies , ranging from , for example , testing the predictions of cold dark matter models ( e.g @xcite ) , checking if such systems could be the host population of quasar absorption line systems ( e.g. @xcite ) etc . as the most chemically unevolved systems in the present - day galaxy population , the faintest dwarfs provide unique laboratories for understanding star formation and galaxy evolution in extreme environments , i.e. low metallicity , low dust content , low pressure , low shear , and low escape velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe and present the first results from a giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) based hi imaging study of faint dwarf galaxies @xmath10 the faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey ( figgs ) .",
    "the primary goal of figgs is to obtain high quality observations of the atomic ism for a large , systematically selected sample of faint , gas rich , dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies .",
    "our gmrt hi images are supplemented by single dish hi observations , hst v and i band images and ground based h@xmath11 images from the 6-m bta telescope .",
    "additionally , the hii region abundances and h@xmath11 rotation curves are being obtained on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , isaac newton telescope ( int ) telescopes on la palma and 6-m russian bta telescope , respectively .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : sample ]",
    "we describe the design and the properties of the galaxy sample .",
    "the main science drivers for figgs are described in section.[sec : science ] .",
    "the gmrt observations are described in section  [ sec : obs ] and the results of the survey are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : result ] .",

    "2008 ( in preparation )    the global hi profiles for our sample galaxies , obtained from the coarsest resolution data cubes ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the parameters derived from the global hi profiles for the whole figgs sample are listed in table  [ tab : hiresult ] .",
    "the columns are as follows : ( 1 )  the galaxy name , ( 2 )  the integrated hi flux along with the errorbars , ( 3 )  the central heliocentric velocity ( v@xmath12 ) , ( 4 )  the velocity width at 50% of the peak ( @xmath13 ) , ( 5 )  the hi diameter ( in arcmin ) at a column density of @xmath14 atoms @xmath15 ( d@xmath16 ) , ( 6 )   the derived hi mass ( m@xmath16 ) , ( 7 )   the hi mass - to - light ratio ( m@xmath17 ) , ( 8)  the ratio of the hi diameter to the holmberg diameter . ( 9 )  the ratio of the gmrt flux to the single dish flux ( fi / fi@xmath18 ) , ( 10 )  the inclination as measured from the hi moment  0 maps ( i@xmath16 ) , and ( 11 )  the reference for the single dish fluxes .    as seen in column(9 ) in table  [ tab : hiresult ] , the hi flux measured from the gmrt hi profiles for most figgs galaxies , in general , agree ( within the errorbars ) with the values obtained from the single dish observations .",
    "the average ratio of gmrt flux to single dish flux is @xmath19 .",
    "this indicates that in general no flux was missed because of the missing short spacings in our interferometric observations .",
    "however , for some galaxies the integrated flux derived from the gmrt observations is significantly smaller than the single dish values .",
    "the gmrt fluxes could be lower than those obtained from single dish measurements either because of ( i )  a calibration error or ( ii )  a large fraction of hi being in an extended distribution that is resolved out , or ( iii )  the single dish flux is erroneous , possibly because of confusion with galactic emission .",
    "however , the flux of the point sources seen in the gmrt images are in good agreement with those listed in nvss , indicating that our calibration is not at fault .",
    "we note that in the case of kkh  12 , kkh  6 , ugc  6456 , ugca  92 and kk  41 there is a strong local hi emission at velocities very close to the systemic velocities , making it likely that the single dish integrated flux measurements for these galaxies were contaminated by blending of their hi emission with that of the galactic emission . in the case of kk  246 , its hi spectrum was near the edge of the gmrt observing band",
    ", hence the flux could not be reliably estimated .",
    "the gmrt integrated hi emission of the sample galaxies , obtained from the coarsest resolution data cubes ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , overlayed on the optical digitized sky survey ( dss ) images are shown in figure  [ fig : mom0 ] .    the hi morphological inclinations ( i@xmath16 ) for our sample galaxies were estimated from the integrated hi maps by fitting elliptical annuli to the hi images at various resolutions . for sample galaxies which have hi disks less extended than 2 synthesised beams ( across the diameter of the galaxy ) at the lowest hi resolution ,",
    "could in principle be derived from the higher resolution hi maps . however , for most sample galaxies ellipse fitting to the high resolution hi maps is not reliable because of clumpiness in the central high column density regions . the derived inclination ( without applying any correction for the intrinsic thickness of the hi disk )",
    "is given in column(10 ) in table  [ tab : hiresult ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : incl_figgs ] shows a comparison between the morphological inclination derived from the optical and hi isophotes of the galaxy .",
    "no correction has been applied for the intrinsic thickness of the disk in both cases .",
    "the solid line shows a case when both inclinations are the same .",
    "we find that for 6 galaxies the hi inclination is significantly greater than the optical inclination ( viz .",
    "kkh  11 , ugc  6456 , ngc  3741 , ugc  8055 , kk  230 , kk  250 ) . on the other hand , for many galaxies the optical inclination",
    "is found to be systematically higher than the inclination derived from the hi morphology .",
    "this result , if interpreted literally , suggest that the hi disks of these galaxies are thicker than the disks of their optical counterparts .",
    "however , we caution that a proper analysis using deconvolved angular sizes of the the hi disks needs to be done before a firm conclusion can be drawn .",
    "the diameter of the hi disk at a column density of @xmath20 atoms @xmath15 ( except for ugca  92 where the hi diameter is measured at @xmath21 atoms @xmath15 ) estimated from the lowest resolution integrated hi emission maps is given in column(7 ) of table  [ tab : hiresult ] .",
    "the ratio of the hi diameter to the optical ( holmberg ) diameter for the sample is also given in column(9 ) of the same table .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_size ] shows the histogram of the derived hi extent of figgs at n@xmath22@xmath15 , normalised to the holmberg diameter of the galaxy .",
    "the median hi extent of the figgs sample ( normalised to holmberg diameter of the galaxy ) is 2.4 . for a comparison , hunter ( 1997 ) using the data compiled from the literature for comparatively bright i",
    "m galaxies found that the ratio of d@xmath23 is somewhat smaller , viz .",
    "the extreme outliers in figure  [ fig : hist_size ] is ngc  3741 , our figgs data show it to have an hi extent of @xmath3 8.3 times d@xmath24 ( holmberg diameter ) .",
    "follow - up wsrt+drao+gmrt observations resulted in hi being detected out to @xmath38.8 d@xmath24 @xmath10 ngc 3741 has the most extended hi disk known .",
    "for ngc  3741 the rotation curve could be derived out a record of @xmath344 times the disk scale length and from the last measured point of the rotation curve we estimate the dynamical mass to light ratio , m@xmath25 @xmath10 which makes it one of the `` darkest '' irregular galaxies known ( begum et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : m_hi_size ] shows a tight correlation between hi mass and the hi diameter , measured at @xmath26 @xmath15 for figgs sample .",
    "the galaxies in figgs sample with accurate distances are shown as solid points , whereas the remaining galaxies are shown as open circle .",
    "the best fit to the whole figgs sample shown as a solid line gives    @xmath27    -0.75 cm the best fit relation was also derived using only the galaxies with trgb distances , however no significant difference was found between the best fit parameters derived in this case and that derived using the whole sample .",
    "eqn.([eqn : mhi_dhi ] ) implies that the hi disks of the figgs sample are well described as having an constant average surface mass density @xmath28 m@xmath2  pc@xmath29 .",
    "a tight correlation between hi mass and the size of the hi disk has been noted earlier for spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and for brighter dwarf galaxies ( swaters 1999 ) . for these samples the hi diameter was measured at a slightly higher column density , viz . 1  m@xmath2 pc@xmath29 . for the figgs galaxies , the relationship between the hi mass and the hi diameter measured at 1 m@xmath2  pc@xmath29 is @xmath30 , for comparison , @xcite measure @xmath31 .",
    "the fit coefficients overlap within the error bars . hence from the figgs data we find that there is at best marginal evidence for a decrease in average hi surface density with decreasing hi mass ; to a good approximation",
    ", the disks of gas rich galaxies , ranging over 3 orders of magnitudes in hi mass , can be described as being drawn from a family with constant hi surface density .",
    "the hi mass also correlates with the optical ( holmberg ) diameter ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_hi_optsize ] ) , although with a larger scatter .",
    "a linear fit with a slope and intercept of 1.74@xmath320.22 and 6.93@xmath320.18 , respectively is shown as a solid line . the larger scatter in the relation between m@xmath16 and the optical diameter ,",
    "also seen in sample of brighter dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) , is probably indicative of a looser coupling between the gas and star formation in dwarfs , compared to that in spiral galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtol_size ] shows the hi mass to light ratio for the figgs sample plotted as a function of the hi extent , d@xmath23 . a trend of an increase in the m@xmath33 with an increase in the hi extent of the galaxies is clearly seen .",
    "the best fit to the figgs sample shown as a solid line gives    @xmath34    -0.75 cm van zee et al.(1995 ) from a hi mapping of a sample of low luminosity galaxies also found an evidence of an extended hi extent for high m@xmath33 galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtol_lb ] shows m@xmath33 for the figgs sample as a function of m@xmath35 . the same quantity for several other spiral and dwarf galaxies , spanning a range in absolute b magnitude from m@xmath36 to m@xmath37 is also plotted .",
    "the sample from which these galaxies have been drawn are listed in the figure caption .",
    "the galaxies in figgs sample with trgb distances are shown as solid circles , whereas the remaining figgs galaxies are shown as open circles .",
    "the solid line shows an empirically determined upper envelope for m@xmath33 as a function of a m@xmath35 from @xcite .",
    "this upper envelope can be interpreted as a minimum fraction of the total baryonic mass which needs to be converted into stars in order for a galaxy of a given baryonic mass to remain gravothermally stable ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that except for and  iv , all figgs galaxies lie much below this upper envelope .",
    "this implies that these galaxies have converted much more baryons into stars than the minimum required for remaining stable . in this context , it is interesting to note that the average gas fraction for the figgs sample is 0.7 .",
    "thus , for the majority of the dwarf galaxies in our sample , the baryonic mass is dominated by gas , rather than stars .    in order to investigate the environmental dependence of the hi content for figgs galaxies , we plot m@xmath33 for figgs sample as a function of tidal index ( ti ) ( figure  [ fig : mtol_ti ] ) . some additional gas rich galaxies with known hi extent",
    "are also plotted in the figure .",
    "ti is taken from @xcite and it represents the local mass density around a given galaxy , estimated using a large sample of galaxies within @xmath3 10 mpc of the milky way .",
    "a negative value of ti for a galaxy indicates that the galaxy is isolated , whereas a positive number indicates that the galaxy is in a dense environment .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtol_ti ] .",
    "shows that most of the figgs galaxies are in less dense environments , and that all the galaxies with high m@xmath33 ( i.e @xmath38 2.5 ) have negative tidal index i.e are isolated .",
    "figure  [ fig : size_ti ] shows the hi extent of the figgs sample , normalised to the optical ( holmberg ) radius , plotted as a function of ti . as seen in the figure , the galaxies with very extended hi disks ( @xmath39 ) are isolated .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented the first results from the faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey ( figgs ) .",
    "figgs is a large imaging program aimed at providing a comprehensive and statistically robust characterisation of the neutral ism properties of extremely faint , nearby , gas rich , dirr galaxies using the gmrt .",
    "the gmrt hi data is supplemented with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "the hi images in conjunction with the optical data will be used to investigate a variety of scientific questions including the star formation feedback on the neutral ism , threshold for star formation , baryonic tf relation and dark matter distribution in low mass galaxies .",
    "the optical properties of the figgs sample , gmrt observations and the main science drivers for the survey are described .",
    "the gmrt integrated hi column density maps and the hi spectra for the sample galaxies are presented .",
    "the global hi properties of the figgs sample , derived from the gmrt observations , and their comparison with the optical properties of the sample galaxies are also presented .",
    "a detailed comparison of the gas distribution , kinematics and star formation in the sample galaxies will be presented in the companion papers .",
