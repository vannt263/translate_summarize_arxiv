    "the problem of an impurity particle interacting with a quantum mechanical bath is one of the fundamental paradigms of modern physics .",
    "such general class of systems , often referred to as polarons , is relevant to understanding electron properties in polar semiconductors , organic materials , doped magnetic mott insulators and high temperature superconductors , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the polaron problem is closely related to the questions of macroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite . in the standard model of high energy physics , the way the higgs field gives mass to various particles is also often given in terms of polaron type dressing @xcite . while the polaron problems have attracted considerable theoretical and experimental attention during the last few decades , many questions , especially addressing nonequilibrium dynamics ,",
    "remain unresolved . in the present paper",
    "we study theoretically a polaron system that consists of an impurity atom confined to a species - selective optical lattice and a homogeneous bec .",
    "the rich toolbox available in the field of ultracold atoms has already made possible a detailed experimental study of fermi polarons @xcite and stimulated active theoretical study of both fermi  @xcite and bose polarons  @xcite .",
    "first experiments have also started to explore physics connected to the bose polaron  @xcite .",
    "additionally , cold atomic ensembles are well suited to the investigation of non - equilibrium phenomena  @xcite since they are very well isolated from the environment and their parameters can be tuned dynamically .",
    "there is thus a growing interest in out of equilibrium polaron problems  @xcite which remained out of reach in solid - state systems due to short equilibration times .",
    "is never exceeded , bo are superimposed by a constant drift velocity @xmath1 as well as diffusion of the polaron wavepacket.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we consider the system shown in fig.[fig : setup](a ) consisting of a single impurity atom , confined to the lowest bloch band of an optical lattice ( hopping @xmath2 , lattice constant @xmath3 ) , immersed in a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "the bec hosts gapless bogoliubov phonons which can scatter off the impurity , leading to polaron formation @xcite .",
    "we subject the impurity to a constant force and examine in detail how the dynamics of the impurity will be affected by its interaction with the surrounding phonons .",
    "this is the central focus of the present article .    while it is well known that an isolated quantum mechanical particle in a lattice will undergo coherent bloch oscillations ( bo ) when subject to a constant force , it is less obvious that a composite quasiparticle , i.e. an impurity coupled to a phonon bath , will display coherent bo . here",
    "we establish that the bose polaron can indeed undergo bo .",
    "next , by calculating the renormalized shape of the dispersion relation of the polaron , we show that phonon dressing has a pronounced effect on bo , which can be observed in experiments by measuring the real time dynamics of impurity atoms .",
    "such experiments can be done using recently developed quantum gas microscopes with single atom resolution  @xcite , but it should be noted that single - site resolution in the optical lattice is not a necessary requirement to observe polaron bo .",
    "polarons in optical lattices were considered earlier by bruderer et al .",
    "@xcite , however , in contrast to our work , they considered the strong coupling limit of the so - called `` small '' polaron where impurity hopping is sub - dominant to phonon coupling .",
    "this regime was further studied in @xcite , and is indeed the traditional approach to lattice polarons @xcite in solid state systems .",
    "we use an alternative approach which is flexible enough to describe both limits of weakly coupled `` large '' polarons and heavy impurities , which can both be achieved in experiments with cold atomic bose - fermi  @xcite or bose - bose  @xcite mixtures .",
    "our approach is based on a variational mean - field ( mf ) ansatz  @xcite , which we generalized earlier to study spectral properties of unconfined impurities in bose gases  @xcite . by extending this approach to lattice impurities , we calculate the full non - equilibrium dynamics of polaron bo . in particular ,",
    "we find that polaron formation takes place on a timescale @xmath4 set by the bec ( @xmath5 is the healing length , @xmath6 the speed of sound ) , and subsequently we observe pronounced bo , see fig.[fig : setup ] ( b ) . additionally , to gain insight into the nature of the coherent polaron dynamics , we introduce an analytic `` adiabatic approximation '' which correctly predicts the predominant characteristics of the polaron trajectory in the subsonic regime , e.g. overall shape , and frequency of oscillations . as an added advantage of our approach , in contrast to the strong coupling polaron approximation , we can approach the supersonic regime , near which we find strong decoherence of the bo in connection with a large drift velocity @xmath1 , i.e. a net polaron current .",
    "such incoherent transport can only be sustained in the presence of decoherence mechanisms , and indeed we observe phonon emission in this regime .",
    "historically , the study of the interplay between coherent bo and inelastic scattering ( e.g. on phonons ) was pioneered in the solid state context by esaki and tsu @xcite , who derived a phenomenological relation between the driving force @xmath7 and the net ( incoherent ) current @xmath1 , and proposed a generic ohmic regime for weak driving , i.e. @xmath8 . the precision of ultra - cold atom experiments allowed a detailed verification of the esaki - tsu model in thermal gases @xcite , and thus triggered theoretical interest in this topic @xcite . while all these works focused on non - condensed gases , bruderer et al .",
    "@xcite considered a 1d bec where the phonons provide an ohmic bath ( see e.g. @xcite ) and established a finite current ( i.e. @xmath9 ) even for subsonic impurities , with a current - force relation @xmath10 of a shape similar to that predicted by esaki and tsu .    in this article",
    "we address the question how polaron bo decohere , and in particular how the polaron drift velocity depends on the driving force , for condensates in arbitrary dimensions @xmath11 . in the weak driving regime , we find that the drift current strongly depends on dimensionality @xmath12 and deviates from the ohmic behavior predicted by the phenomenological esaki - tsu relation .",
    "we show that a quantitative description of polaron drift can be obtained by applying fermi s golden rule to calculate the phonon emission of oscillating impurity atoms .",
    "this analysis correctly reproduces the current - force relation @xmath13 observed in our numerics for weak driving .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce our model and employ the lee - low - pines unitary transformation to make use of the discrete translational invariance ( by a lattice period ) of our problem .",
    "then in sec.[sec : staticprops ] we discuss the ground state of the impurity - bose system in the presence of a lattice , and calculate the renormalized polaron dispersion .",
    "we also present the mf phase diagram which shows where the subsonic to supersonic transition takes place . in sec.[sec : adiabbo ] we discuss polaron bo within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we also show that direct imaging of real - space impurity trajectories reveals the renormalized polaron dispersion .",
    "how non - adiabatic corrections modify bo is studied in sec.[sec : dynamics ] using a time - dependent variational wavefunction .",
    "in sec.[sec : nonadiabatic ] we discuss incoherent polaron transport and present numerical as well as analytical results for its dependence on the driving force . finally in sec.[sec : summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we present our theoretical model , starting from the microscopic hamiltonian in subsection [ subsec : micromodel ] .",
    "we subsequently simplify the latter by applying bogoliubov theory for the bec as well as nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation for the free impurity .",
    "then we derive the corresponding impurity - boson interaction , which requires careful treatment of the two - particle scattering problem in order to derive correct system parameters .",
    "having established the connection to microscopic properties , we discuss realistic numbers and introduce a dimensionless polaron coupling constant . in the second part [ sec : llp ]",
    "we apply the lee - low - pines transformation to our model , which is at the heart of our formalism and makes conservation of the polaron quasimomentum explicit .    here , as well as in the subsequent three sections , we will focus on the case of a three dimensional bec ( @xmath14 ) , but an analogous analysis can be done for dimensions @xmath15 .",
    "we will discuss the difference in dynamics of systems of different dimensionality in section [ sec : nonadiabatic ] .",
    "we start by considering weakly interacting bosons of mass @xmath16 in three spatial dimensions ( @xmath14 ) and at zero temperature , which will be described by the field operator @xmath17 .",
    "next we introduce a single impurity of mass @xmath18 , which can be described by a second field operator @xmath19 .",
    "the impurity is furthermore confined to a deep species - selective optical lattice which is completely immersed in the surrounding bose gas .",
    "for concreteness we assume the lattice to be one - dimensional ( pointing along @xmath20 ) , but our analysis can easily be carried over to arbitrary lattice dimensions . the bosons and impurity",
    "interact via a contact interaction of strength @xmath21 .",
    "since we wish to study transport properties of the dressed impurity , we will also consider a constant force @xmath7 acting on the impurity alone . in experiments",
    "this force can e.g. be applied using a magnetic field gradient@xcite .",

    "the corresponding wannier functions can be approximated by local oscillator wavefunctions , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the oscillator length in a micro trap and @xmath34 the corresponding micro trap frequency , given by the recoil energy @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an effective hopping @xmath2 between lattice sites , such that  after inclusion of the uniform force  the free impurity hamiltonian reads @xmath36    in the absence of the impurity , bosons condense and form a bec . in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , we will assume that the impurity - boson interaction does not significantly alter the many - body spectrum of the bath , allowing us to treat the bosons as an unperturbed homogeneous condensate within the bogoliubov approximation  @xcite . consequently , the bec is fully characterized by the speed of sound @xmath6 , the healing length @xmath5 and its density @xmath37 .",
    "the elementary excitations of the system are gapless ( bogoliubov ) phonons @xmath38 , the dispersion relation of which reads @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the 3d phonon momentum ( with @xmath41 denoting its absolute value ) , and the free boson hamiltonian is given by @xmath42 in this paper @xmath43 denotes the integral over all momenta from the entire @xmath44-space .      in the discussion of the interaction hamiltonian describing impurity - boson scattering , we restrict ourselves to the tight binding - limit .",
    "this allows us to expand the impurity field in terms of wannier orbitals , @xmath45 using this decomposition , eq .",
    "yields the following expression for the impurity - boson hamiltonian , @xmath46 where we neglected phonon - induced hoppings ( the validity of this approximation will be discussed further below ) .",
    "an important question is how the interaction strength @xmath47 in the simplified model above relates to the measurable impurity - boson scattering length @xmath48 . while for unconfined impurities this relation is usually derived from the lippmann - schwinger equation describing two - particle scattering , it is more involved for an impurity confined to a lattice . in this case",
    "the new scattering length @xmath49 has to be distinguished from its free - space counter part , and can even be substantially modified due to lattice effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , also the effective range @xmath50 of the interaction between a free boson and an impurity confined to a lattice can be modified by the lattice .",
    "we can take this effect into account in our model by choosing a proper extent @xmath51 of wannier functions in eq ..    in the follwing",
    "we will not calculate the numerical relation between @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) in the lattice and its free - space counterpart @xmath48 .",
    "instead we assume that these numbers are known  either from numerical calculations @xcite or from an experiment @xcite  and work with the effective model eq .. in the appendix [ appdx : interactionstrengthandscatteringlength ] we discuss in detail how @xmath49 and @xmath50 relate to our model parameters @xmath47 and @xmath51 , in the tight - binding case .",
    "next , in order to derive a simplified hamiltonian , we replace bare bosons @xmath17 by bogoliubov phonons @xmath38 . in doing so",
    ", we will assume sufficiently weak interactions between the impurity and the bosons , thus causing negligible quantum depletion of the condensate .",
    "this allows us to neglect two - phonon processes corresponding to terms like @xmath52 in the full hamiltonian . as shown in @xcite and",
    " via a different approach  in the appendix [ sec : effecham ] of this paper , it is justified for @xmath53    under this condition , and provided that phonon - induced hopping can be neglected , we arrive at a hamiltonian which is closely related to the one derived by frhlich @xcite , @xmath54 as we show in a more detailed calculation in appendix [ sec : effecham ] . here",

    "@xmath56 describes scattering of phonons on an impurity localized at site @xmath31 ( with amplitude @xmath57 ) .",
    "this term thus breaks the conservation of total phonon momentum ( and number ) , and we stress that phonon momenta @xmath44 can take arbitrary values @xmath58 , not restricted to the brillouin zone ( bz ) defined by the impurity lattice . appearing in eq should be restricted to the bz . in this paper",
    "we consider only the case when bec atoms are _ not _ affected by the optical lattice . ]",

    "we may expand @xmath64 in the overlap above .",
    "the zeroth order term thus vanishes because of orthogonality of wannier functions , and the leading order term is @xmath65 .      as we discussed earlier , in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite we want our analysis to be applicable to the case of \" large  polarons , characterized by a phonon cloud with radius exceeding the impurity lattice spacing , @xmath66 .",
    "such polarons are typical when interactions are weak compared to impurity hopping , leading to a loosely confined phonon cloud .",
    "indeed , it is convenient to measure the strength of interactions by defining the following dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath67 which appears naturally in our formalism .",
    "it describes the ratio between characteristic impurity - boson interactions @xmath68 and typical phonon energies @xmath69 , @xmath70 . let us note that tempere et al .",

    "such a displacement @xmath94 ( modulo reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath95 ) is generated by the unitary transformation @xmath96 , where the impurity position operator is defined by @xmath97 . comparing this to eq .",

    "we stress , however , that the total _",
    "phonon_-momentum @xmath112 of the system is not conserved .    even in the presence of a non - vanishing force @xmath113",
    "the hamiltonian is still block - diagonal for all times , @xmath114 and quasimomentum evolves in time according to @xmath115 i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "this relation has the following physical meaning : if we start with an initial state that has a well defined quasimomentum @xmath117 , then the quasimomentum of the system remains a well defined quantity .",
    "the rate of change of the quasimomentum is given by @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath118 . thus states that correspond to different initial momenta do not mix in the time - evolution of the system .",
    "before turning to the nonequilibrium problem of polaron bo in the next section , we discuss the equilibrium properties at @xmath109 . because we employed the lee - low - pines canonical transformation above , quasimomentum @xmath111",
    "is explicitly conserved in the hamiltonian .",
    "this enables us to treat every sector of fixed @xmath111 separately for the characterization of the equilibrium state .",

    "this is related to the peak observed in the renormalized polaron dispersion in fig.[fig : staticmfpolaron ] ( a ) .",

    "we close the section by pointing out how these trajectories can be used to measure the renormalized polaron dispersion in an experiment . in the following section we will check the validity of the adiabatic approximation by solving full non - equilibrium dynamics .",

    "the initial state considered in most of the remaining part of this paper can be realized experimentally by different means .",

    "therefore an initially non - interacting impurity , immersed in a cold bec , suddenly starts to interact strongly with the surrounding phonons as the magnetic field approaches the feshbach resonance .    alternatively ,",
    "if a different internal ( e.g. hyperfine ) state of the majority bosons is used as an impurity like e.g. in @xcite , the initial state can be prepared by applying a microwave pulse , which is possible also in combination with local addressing techniques @xcite . in this case , however , the preparation of a phonon vacuum state like in eq . is hard to achieve since a spin - flip always comes along with a local excitation of the bec .",
    "nevertheless , the true initial state for this situation can be calculated exactly if after a local spin - flip the impurity is tightly confined by an addressing beam @xcite until the dynamic evolution is started at time @xmath179 .",
    "in fact , a sufficiently tight local confinement of the impurity corresponds to vanishing hopping @xmath190 , and in this case the mf ansatz eq .",
