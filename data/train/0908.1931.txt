    "although the primary source of information in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the angular power spectrum , tests of other statistics provide an important consistency check for cosmological models .",
    "the key assumptions of gaussianity and isotropy of the cmb , particularly of the wmap data @xcite , have both been challenged by more complex tests .",
    "the isotropy of the cmb has been strongly challenged with respect to power distribution @xcite and multipole alignment @xcite , and some evidence for non - gaussianty has been noted among many statistical tests @xcite .",
    "many such tests use higher order statistics , moving beyond the correlation of pairs of sky pixels and using more complex comparisons .",
    "the statistics of cmb extrema have previously been studied by looking at the statistics of hot and cold spots @xcite ; here we address the inverse question : given patches of fixed area , what are the statistics of the extremes within those patches ?",
    "we develop and demonstrate the use of a new statistical approach , based on the statistics of extreme events .",
    "we find that the test has weak discriminatory power but shows some suggestion of non - gaussianity at low @xmath1 .",
    "gumbel statistics describe the behaviour of sample extrema in the same way that gaussian statistics are used to describe the behaviour of sample means . for example , if we draw @xmath2 independent values from a gaussian distribution @xmath3 , the average of those values will also be gaussian - distributed with mean @xmath4 and standard deviation @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , the maximum and minimum of that sample will , in the limit , follow a gumbel distribution @xcite .",
    "just as the central limit theorem implies that sample means from any distribution will , in the limit , tend to a gaussian profile , all sample extrema will tend to a gumbel distribution for sufficiently large sample size .",
    "the distribution is also known in literature as the von mises family of distributions @xcite .",
    "gumbel statistics have found application in a number of fields , primarily financial and meteorological . in this paper",
    "we apply gumbel statistics to cmb - type maps and hence discuss cosmological applications of gumbel distributions .",
    "section [ sec : distribution ] presents the mathematical basis of gumbel statistics . in section [ sec : cmb ] we apply the formalism to the cmb and simulated maps to demonstrate our method .",
    "section [ sec : cmb_ng ] compares the findings for the cmb to those for simulated gaussian maps .",
    "sections [ sec : ng ] applies gumbel statistics to searching for potential non - gaussianities in simulated maps .",
    "the most general gumbel profile for sample maxima is given by the cumulative distribution function of the form @xcite : @xmath6    where @xmath7 is related to the variable value @xmath8 via scale and intercept parameters : @xmath9 . in the context of the cmb @xmath8 is the maximum temperature of a pixel in a patch . the quantity @xmath10 is a shape parameter that can take any real value , depending on the underlying distribution .",
    "figure [ gpdf ] plots the probability density functions , corresponding to equation [ defcdf ] , using a selection of @xmath10 values .",
    "a similar family of distributions exists for the sample minimum , and we shall refer to both collectively as ` gumbel statistics ' .",
    "are : @xmath11 ( dot ) , @xmath12 ( dash ) , @xmath13 ( solid ) , @xmath14 ( dash - dot).[gpdf ] ]    the value of @xmath10 for many analytic underlying distributions can be calculated rigorously @xcite .",
    "for example , a sample of identically distributed gaussian variables can be shown to yield @xmath10 equal to zero for both maxima and minima . in general , though , the @xmath10 one calculates will be different for the maxima and minima limit distributions . the distribution of the cmb , on the other hand , is a more complicated multi - dimensional gaussian , and there is no analytic prediction for its gumbel statistics .",
    "we can , though , estimate the @xmath10 parameter by repeatedly taking a `` sample of samples '' from a distribution - taking @xmath2 sets of values from the distribution , each containing @xmath15 measurements , and recording the maximum in each set .",
    "when the number @xmath2 of such maxima is large enough , the corresponding density function can be fitted to a gumbel form .",
    "the @xmath10 for the underlying distribution will be reflected accurately in the data , provided that @xmath15 is large enough for an analogy of the central limit theorem to hold , and we will be able to estimate its value accurately if @xmath2 is large enough .",
    "to study the extreme statistics of cmb - type maps , we make use of randomly placed circular regions ( ` patches ' ) . we position a number of such patches on the cmb sky and record the maximum and minimum temperatures within them ( figure [ 600_4deg_proc ] ) . for gumbel statistics to be applicable to this set of extremes",
    ", the patches must be large enough to contain sufficient independent temperatures for the analogy to the central limit theorem to hold .",
    "this is a function of the pixel and patch size , as well as the map resolution .",
    "we take as our cmb data the five - year internal linear combination ( ilc ) map @xcite .",
    "an upper limit to the fourier resolution ( maximum @xmath1 value ) credibly usable in the ilc map is set by foreground emission , so that at @xmath16 the true cmb signal becomes progressively contaminated @xcite .",
    "another constraint is having only a finite cmb sky to sample , as a result of which our sets of samples will tend to overlap if patch sizes are too large .",
    "the ideal patch size would be large enough to allow sufficient variability , yet small enough to prevent overlapping . in practice ,",
    "patches of angular radius between @xmath17 and @xmath18 fulfill both these conditions .",
    "the ilc map is certainly not ideal : we are forced to use patches on scales small enough that foregrounds can contaminate them .",
    "we avoid this by removing high spatial frequency modes from the map , but this will reduce the detectability of any real signals that are present on smaller and intermediate scales . a full analysis could employ data from the high - signal frequency bands and a much more conservative mask , but the ilc map serves to illustrate the process and perform basic tests .",
    "we test whether gumbel statistics are applicable to cmb - type data by computing @xmath10 for the cmb and simulated gaussian maps .",
    "since we will later examine the use of gumbel statistics in detecting non - gaussianity ( section [ sec : ng ] ) , we also test simulated maps with a varied non - gaussian signal generated using the method of liguori et .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our algorithm is as follows . to prevent the worst contamination from galactic foreground emission , we first mask the data using the processing mask supplied by the wmap team @xcite , which covers 6% of the sky .",
    "we then randomly place patches of fixed angular radius over the remaining map ( figure [ 600_4deg_proc ] ) and record the maximum / minimum temperature values in each region enclosed .",
    "the sets of maxima and minima are then converted into cdf profiles to which a gumbel distribution ( e.g. equation ( [ defcdf ] ) for the maxima ) can be fitted . this way , one obtains the gumbel parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath10 for the map in question .",
    "parameter errors are obtained , using a simple monte carlo process over the whole algorithm .",
    "error bars drawn in subsequent plots will correspond to @xmath21 in total width .",
    "radius over a cmb map with the processing mask applied.[600_4deg_proc ] ]    our simulated maps are realisations of a concordance @xmath22 cosmology with wmap standard cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "our non - gaussian maps are generated using the same power spectrum but have a non - gaussian component with a tunable value of .",
    "analysis on simulated maps is done in the same manner as for the ilc , including the masking of the sky . the only difference is introduced in the monte carlo algorithm , where we generate a new simulated map each time the random placement of patches is rerun . by doing so we obtain estimates of gumbel parameters for all maps with a particular power spectrum .        for both real and simulated data ,",
    "the collected sets of maxima and minima are very well fit by the gumbel form with parameters @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ threehist ] shows three sample fits with the ilc data for both maxima and minima .",
    "evidently , in all cases the fits are close to ideal .",
    "this was also the case for simulated maps , both gaussian and non - gaussian ( examined up to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the gumbel @xmath10 parameter seems therefore to be a well - defined statistic characterizing a cmb - type map at a given resolution .",
    "patches at @xmath25 ( dot ) , maxima fit using 1000 @xmath17 patches at @xmath26 ( solid ) , minima fit using 600 @xmath27 patches at @xmath25 ( dash).[threehist ] ]      we next investigate the variation in @xmath10 with sample size .",
    "we expect @xmath10 to be independent of the sample ( patch ) size , once a critical value is reached , since one would then keep approaching the limiting distribution with increasing accuracy .",
    "we test the stability of @xmath10 by repeating the fitting procedure for varying patch size , using in each case the maximum number of patches without oversampling .",
    "results are shown in figure [ thwoscatters ] for patches varied between @xmath17 to @xmath28 in radius , with total number of patches ranging between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . only results for maxima",
    "are displayed , since the minima fits lead to similar conclusions .",
    "since they are free of foregrounds , we examine the simulated data over a greater range of .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ thwoscatters ] , the results are consistent with @xmath10 remaining constant over the patch size for both the ilc and simulated gaussian maps , smoothed to a variety of .",
    "this result was also seen to hold for simulated non - gaussian maps .",
    "we conclude that the gumbel treatment is valid for a range of simulated maps , with non - gaussianity spanning between @xmath31 and @xmath24 , and for the ilc map .     versus patch radius plotted for the maxima of the cmb map ( solid ) and simulated gaussian maps ( dot ) .",

    "the pdfs of temperature maxima are limited on the right ( figure [ gpdf ] ) , whereas the ones for temperature minima are limited on the left ; i.e. in both cases the tail of interest has an upper bound .",
    "it is also observed that the @xmath10 values for maxima tend to be generally lower and vary more with than for the minima . in the case of the ilc ,",
    "gumbel statistics differentiate positive and negative temperature fluctuations within the data by a clear spread ( figure [ band ] ) .",
    "this result is not true for simulated gaussian maps , where the values for maxima closely mirror those for the minima .",
    "this is expected , given a map generated to be symmetric about the zero temperature .",
    "a pertinent question to investigate is whether or not gumbel statistics of the cmb differ from statistics collected using simulated gaussian maps .",
    "any notable difference would be evidence against the 5-year ilc map being a purely gaussian data set .    to study possible differences , we collect values of @xmath10 from the ilc and from simulated gaussian maps using a fixed patch radius ( @xmath35 ) and examine their variation with .",
    "we present data for four different fourier resolutions : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "increasing further would imply using the data at much higher accuracy than recommended by the wmap team and is also found to add no significant variation . using lower , on the other hand , would reduce the number of independent temperatures inside a patch , invalidating the gumbel approach .",
    "figure [ band ] ( solid line ) shows results for the cmb , which can be compared with the gaussian data ( grey band ) , collected and averaged over 100 simulated maps .",
    "the band is then an indication of where data for a single gaussian realisation would be expected to lie .",
    "separate results for the cmb north ( dash ) and south ( dot ) hemispheres are also plotted .",
    "as seen , data for the cmb display slight variation with , though not of high statistical significance .",
    "more importantly , the cmb data show a spread of several @xmath38 between the maxima and minima which is not present in the simulated gaussian results .     versus , plotted for the cmb and simulated gaussian maps .",
    "the data correspond to : cmb full sky ( solid ) , cmb north hemisphere ( dash ) , cmb south hemisphere ( dot ) .",
    "both maxima fits ( star ) and minima fits ( triangle ) are given .",
    "the grey band corresponds to the full - sky results ( maxima , minima ) for simulated gaussian maps , averaged over 100 realisations . [ band ] ]    to quantify the likelihood of this separation between maxima and minima , we generate 1000 gaussian maps and record values of @xmath39 , collected at @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting histogram is shown in figure [ thists ] ( left ) , with the arrow indicating the corresponding spread in the cmb .",
    "evidently , on this criterion the ilc map is still consistent with being a gaussian set .",
    "for 1000 simulated full - sky gaussian maps , examined at @xmath32 .",
    "the arrow indicates the cmb value .",
    "right : histogram showing the range of @xmath39 for 1000 simulated gaussian hemispheres ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the range of cmb values , as seen in figure [ diffmap].[thists ] ]    on further investigation , it is found that the spread in @xmath10 within the cmb varies considerably with direction . rerunning the same analysis",
    "with the ilc map split into north and south hemispheres we find that values of @xmath10 change their magnitude by several @xmath38 , and the spread between maxima and minima is actually reversed ( figure [ band ] , dot , dash ) .",
    "the result for the whole sky ( solid ) masks considerable anisotropy within the data set .",
    "variations of this kind are not found in gaussian maps , when averaged over , though individual realisations with similar north - south asymmetry were encountered .    to survey this anisotropy within the cmb , we rotate the north - south axis to varying orientations and repeat the analysis for the corresponding ` north ' hemisphere only .",
    "results are shown in figure [ diffmap ] . here",
    ", the spread in @xmath10 for each rotated hemisphere ( @xmath39 measured at @xmath40 ) is shown as the value for the pixel , located along the direction of the rotated ` north ' axis .    the value of @xmath39 in a hemisphere is thus seen to vary between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , depending on orientation . to compare with gaussian maps , we record the same statistic for 1000 simulated hemispheres , as shown in figure [ thists ] ( right ) .",
    "we thus find that the variation in @xmath39 within the cmb is of magnitude comparable to simulated gaussian maps , though the strongest signal would only be reproduced in @xmath43 of the simulated maps .",
    "for the cmb ( @xmath32 ) , as measured using hemispheres of different angular orientation .",
    "the pixel position corresponds to the orientation of the rotated north axis .",
    "angular positions of the ecliptic and galactic poles are shown superimposed ( nep , sep , ngp , sgp ) as is the location of the virgo cluster and the orientation of the cmb dipole @xcite .",
    "three known cmb anomalies are also indicated : the cut of maximum hemispheric power asymmetry @xcite , the axis of evil @xcite , and the cold spot @xcite ]    figure [ diffmap ] also plots well - known cmb anomalies that have previously been reported @xcite .",
    "the alignment which maximizes the gumbel discriminant is seen to be , like the axis of evil @xcite , close to the equator of another previously reported anomaly - the anisotropic division of power between the ecliptic hemispheres @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "having examined the gumbel statistics of the cmb , we can report considerable variety in the values of @xmath10 within the data set .",
    "the data are consistent with gaussianity , though the observed signal is only reproduced in @xmath43 of the simulated gaussian maps .",
    "having established the validity of the gumbel approach as applied to the cmb and simulated data ( section [ sec : cmb ] ) , we probe further its usefulness in detecting non - gaussian cmb signals , generated by quadratic perturbations in the primordial potential field , . for a review of previous work , see @xcite .",
    "to begin , we examine the variation of @xmath10 withusing high - resolution simulated maps with @xmath34 .",
    "we vary over the range of @xmath13 to @xmath44 , a region over which @xmath10 has been tested to be a reliable parameter .",
    "figure [ gfnl ] plots the results .     as obtained for maxima of simulated non - gaussian maps ( @xmath34 ) of varying .",
    "results are plotted for patch sizes @xmath17 ( star ) and @xmath27 ( diamond).[gfnl ] ]    we observe a monotonic increase in @xmath10 as is varied from 1000 to 3000 after which point the value seems to stabilise .",
    "similar though less steep monotonic increase is found when plotting values of @xmath10 for gumbel minima .",
    "the size of error bars on the @xmath10 parameter in figure [ gfnl ] constrain the lowest signal likely to be detected by this method to approximately @xmath45 .",
    "the procedure seems to afford no way of obtaining more precise @xmath10 estimates , which would allow us to detect lower @xmath46 .",
    "the ilc exhibits some divergence from the gaussian simulations at about the @xmath47 level ( see above ) .",
    "there are three possible explanations for this .",
    "one possibility is residual impact from foregrounds , even at these large scales .",
    "secondly , the non - gaussian signature might be of a form not well described by .",
    "the third possibility is a simple statistical fluctuation .",
    "we have introduced the statistics of sample extremes , gumbel statistics , to the study of cmb maps .",
    "we have shown the statistics to provide a good description of the wmap data set despite the highly correlated fluctuations therein .",
    "we have investigated the use of gumbel statistics in non - gaussianity detection , the principal advantage of our method being its lack of restrictions as to the underlying statistics of the cmb .",
    "the simplest methods , based on gumbel statistics , are unlikely to detect any @xmath0 .",
    "there are weak hints of non - gaussianity at low @xmath1 , as we can only reproduce the observed statistics some @xmath47 of the time in gaussian realisations , but no hard evidence .",
    "we also find that there is a preferred hemispheric cut that optimises the gumbel discriminant .",
