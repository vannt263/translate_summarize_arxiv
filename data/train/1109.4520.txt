    "accessing electronic transport in nanoscale systems requires an understanding not only of the current but also its fluctuations . whereas charge transfer between normal metals proceeds via single electron transfer processes , in normal - superconductor hybrid structures the current transport at energies below the superconducting gap is governed by andreev reflection.@xcite an electron from the normal conductor",
    "can not enter the superconductor at energies below the gap and is therefore retroreflected as a hole leaving a cooper pair behind .    in recent years",
    "it has become possible to not only make nanometer sized junctions @xcite but also to contact a single impurity via two leads.@xcite this configuration and the corresponding anderson impurity model allows to study the kondo effect@xcite in many geometries . @xcite",
    "normal - quantum dot - superconductor hybrid structures are of special interest since they represent the main building blocks of andreev entanglers.@xcite    to obtain a complete knowledge of the charge transfer in these systems it is not sufficient to study the nonlinear @xmath0 and the shot noise alone .",

    "likewise the analytical techniques developed so far for the @xmath0 characteristics of normal - quantum dot - superconductor devices@xcite even in the simplest cases lead to rather cumbersome calculations .    in this work",

    "we analyse the interplay of the kondo effect@xcite and superconductivity@xcite for situations in which @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the superconductor gap and @xmath4 is the kondo resonance width .",
    "we also assume a strong asymmetry of the couplings of the quantum dot to the normal electrode and the superconductor / stm tip . while an stm tip represents a special normal contact the asymmetry is generic in the case of a normal - quantum dot - superconductor junction in this regime.@xcite as a first step we derive the fcs for a normal - superconductor junction using the hamiltonian approach as introduced in [ ] . in this approach to quantum transport nanostructures",

    "our approach allows us to formulate the effective model for a coupled quantum dot .",
    "we find that the explicit consideration of andreev reflection in normal - quantum dot - superconductor junctions improves the fit to the experimental conductance compared to previous studies and leads to a considerable enhancement of the fano factor for voltages below the gap .",
    "we also show how andreev reflections in a junction with two quantum dots lead to a positive cross correlation of the currents in the normal leads .",
