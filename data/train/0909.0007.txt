    "more than ten years after the supernova observations @xcite led to the general acceptance that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , we are still far from a consensus on what is responsible for the acceleration .",
    "although there is a name for the phenomenon , dark energy , there is as of yet no convincing physical explanation .",
    "for this reason it is imperative to learn as much as possible from observations .",
    "the fundamental observable considered so far is the equation of state parameter @xmath0 which connects the average energy density @xmath1 and the average pressure @xmath2 through @xmath3 .",
    "this parameter characterizes the background expansion rate and the distances . while some models make specific predictions , like @xmath4 for a cosmological constant , there are whole families of models that can lead to any desired evolution of @xmath5 ( possibly with some weak constraints like @xmath6 ) .",
    "typical examples include scalar - field models like quintessence or k - essence , or generalized gravity models like scalar - tensor and @xmath7 theories .",
    "these theories can not be ruled out based on a measurement of @xmath0 alone",
    ". however , in general their perturbations evolve differently@xcite .",
    "the dark energy perturbations are therefore like a fingerprint of these models and , if measured , will allow to discriminate much more precisely between competing theories , and hopefully will allow to shed some light on the physical nature of whatever accelerates the expansion of the universe .    for many models ,",
    "the behavior of perturbations at the linear level can be described in terms of those of a fluid with a certain sound speed .",
    "this is the case for quintessence ( canonical scalar - field ) models for which the sound speed is @xmath8 , and for many k - essence models where the sound speed is arbitrary . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on this class of models , and assume in addition that both @xmath9 and @xmath0 are constant",
    ". this latter assumption is usually violated , but the results should nonetheless allow insight into the behavior of the perturbations . for models where the quantities vary only slowly with time , we expect the results to still hold in an averaged sense , due to the indirect nature of most observations .",
    "the big advantage of making these assumptions is that it allows us to solve the perturbations analytically under the additional condition of matter domination , leading to surprisingly simple results .",
    "in addition , when expressed in terms of the change of the gravitational potential relative to the case without dark energy perturbations then the simple formulae turn out to be a surprisingly good approximation until today .",
    "our results should be seen in this context , as it is of course always possible to solve the perturbation equations numerically . however , analytical results allow a much better insight and also an easy way to see how the behavior changes as a function of the parameters .",
    "experiments tell us that the dark energy is at most very weakly coupled to the things that we can observe directly , like galaxies and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "it is therefore not only necessary to determine the dark energy perturbations but also to connect them to actual observables .",
    "we use our simple analytical results and make a small step in that direction , trying to establish the impact of the dark energy perturbations onto the matter power spectrum and the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect in the cmb . our treatment here is far from complete and only an initial attempt to deal with the observational impact of the dark energy perturbations . in a follow - up publication @xcite we will pay particular attention to the question whether it is possible to observe the class of perturbations that we study here , using probes of lensing and of the matter power spectrum .    in detail , the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a short discussion of the perturbation equations to set the scene and to define our variables , and remind the reader of the solution for the matter perturbations during matter domination .",
    "we then derive simplified solutions for the dark energy perturbations during matter domination .",
    "those expressions are a good fit in their respective domain of validity , but once the dark energy starts to dominate they deviate from the numerical solution .",
    "we then show that the function @xmath10 used in @xcite is well described by our solutions , even after matter domination ends .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "we finally use this observation to consider the impact of the dark energy perturbations on the matter power spectrum and the growth rate of the matter perturbations , as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also investigate which aspect of the dark energy perturbations affects the isw effect most strongly , before concluding .",
    "the appendices give more details on how we compared our analytical formulae to numerical results and on the evolution of the decaying modes that were neglected .",
    "throughout this paper , we will use overdots to denote derivatives with respect to conformal time @xmath11 , related to cosmic time by @xmath12 .",
    "we will denote the physical hubble parameter with @xmath13 and with @xmath14 the conformal hubble parameter .",
    "we consider only spatially flat universes , and our metric convention is defined by the line element , ds^2 = a^2 .",
    "[ pert_newton_ds ] we are therefore working in the newtonian or longitudinal gauge , which influences the resulting perturbations especially on scales larger than the hubble horizon , @xmath15 . on much smaller scales",
    "the choice of gauge is less important , and observables are independent of the gauge choice .",
    "the perturbation equations for a fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath16 are @xcite  & = & 3(1+w )  - - 3 ( -w ) [ delta ] + v & = & -(1 - 3w ) + + ( 1+w ) + & & -(1+w ) . [ v ] where @xmath17 is the density contrast , @xmath18 is the scalar velocity perturbation ( see also @xcite ) and the prime means the derivative with respect to the scale factor @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we will look only at fluids with vanishing anisotropic stress , @xmath20 , so that there is a single gravitational potential , k^2=-4ga^2 _ j _ j ( _ j+v_j ) [ eq : phi ] and @xmath21 .",
    "the sum on the right hand side runs over all fluids . for our purposes",
    ", we will assume the presence of a matter fluid with @xmath22 as well as a dark energy fluid , parametrised by a constant @xmath0 and a sound speed @xmath9 which determines the pressure perturbation through p = c_s^2+v .",
    "where @xmath23 is called the adiabatic sound speed of the fluid .",
    "this is not always a good parametrization , for example for models that cross the phantom barrier @xmath4 @xcite or when mimicking modified gravity models @xcite ( in which case also generically @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , it covers a wide class of models , for example canonical scalar fields ( quintessence , in which case @xmath8 ) and other scalar - field models ( like k - essence , which allows for @xmath25 ) . as we only consider models with constant @xmath0 , we have that @xmath26 . the perturbation equations ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ v ] ) become in this case  & = & - ( 1 + ) + & & -(c_s^2-w)+3(1+w) [ deltap ] + v & = & -(1 - 3c_s^2 ) + + ( 1+w ) [ vp ]    in general it is difficult to solve these equations . to simplify the problem",
    ", we will assume that the universe is matter dominated .",
    "this means that the hubble expansion rate is given by h^2 = h_0 ^ 2 _ m a^-3 = _ m and that only the matter perturbations contribute to the gravitational potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "we can therefore first solve for the matter perturbations alone , without considering the dark energy , and then use the resulting gravitational potential as an external source in the equations for the dark energy perturbations .",
    "of course this approximation , and even more the assumption of a matter dominated background evolution , will change the results , and we will need to study what happens as the assumptions break down .",
    "the perturbation equations for the matter perturbations then are _m & = & - + 3 + v_m & = & - + + k^2 & = & - ( _ m+v_m ) as is well known , a solution to this set of equations is _ m & = & _ _ 0(a + 3 ) = _ _ 0a ( 1 + 3 ) [ eq : deltam ] + v_m & = & - _ _ 0h_0 a^1/2 + k^2 & = & - _ _ 0h_0 ^ 2 _ m [ eq : phim ] where the constant @xmath27 sets the overall scale ( since the equations are linear ) . this can be verified simply by inserting them into the differential equations .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is set by the initial conditions and is in general a function of @xmath28 .",
    "additionally the growth of the matter perturbations is suppressed during radiation domination , so that @xmath29 is smaller than expected for the scales that enter the horizon during radiation domination .",
    "however , the same happens for the dark energy perturbations so that the effects cancel out when comparing the perturbations in matter and dark energy . for more details",
    "see appendix [ app : camb ] which discusses how we compare the analytical results to camb @xcite .",
    "we see that the gravitational potential is constant as a function of time on all scales .",
    "the matter perturbations grow linearly with @xmath19 on small scales , and they are constant on super - horizon scales ( but their behavior on those large scales depends on the gauge choice ) .",
    "we will now use the constant @xmath30 of the last section to look for solutions to the general perturbation equations . we will study them in different limits , and then compare the results with full numerical solutions .",
    "see also @xcite for results using different approximations .",
    "generically , we expect at least three regimes with different behavior of the perturbations :    * perturbations larger than the causal horizon * perturbations smaller than the causal horizon , but larger than the sound horizon * perturbations smaller than the sound horizon    we start by looking at perturbations larger than the sound horizon , @xmath31 . in this case , we neglect all terms containing the sound speed in eq .",
    "( [ vp ] ) , effectively setting @xmath32 .",
    "the solution for the velocity perturbation is ( neglecting a decaying solution @xmath33 ) v = - _ _ 0(1+w ) h_0 a^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : vsub ] up to the prefactor @xmath34 this is the same as for the matter velocity perturbations .",
    "we find that this expression is valid on scales larger than the sound horizon even if the sound speed is non - zero .",
    "we can now insert this solution for the dark energy velocity perturbation into eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) .",
    "again setting @xmath32 we find the solution = _ _ 0(1+w ) ( + ) [ eq : dsub ] where we neglected a term proportional to @xmath35 which is decaying as long as @xmath0 is negative .",
    "not surprisingly , also this solution becomes equal to the one for matter perturbations for @xmath36 .",
    "relative to the matter perturbations the dark energy perturbations are suppressed by the factor @xmath34 .",
    "this factor is necessarily always there , as the gravitational potential terms contain it .",
    "it can be thought of as modulating the strength of the coupling of the dark energy perturbations to the perturbations in the metric . for @xmath4",
    "the dark energy perturbations are completely decoupled ( in the sense that they do not feel metric perturbations  but they can still produce them if the dark energy perturbations are not zero ) .    just like eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltam ] ) the solution is composed of two terms , where the second one dominates on scales larger than the horizon ( @xmath37 ) and the first on smaller scales ( but still larger than the sound horizon ) .",
    "the super - horizon part of the solution is the same as for matter apart from the overall @xmath34 factor , while the sub - horizon solution is additionally suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 relative to the matter perturbations .",
    "although these factors can suppress the dark energy perturbations significantly compared to the dark matter perturbations , especially if @xmath0 is close to @xmath39 , the existence of a sound horizon is even more important . inside the causal horizon ,",
    "the dark matter perturbations grow linearly with @xmath19 ( until the perturbations become non - linear ) .",
    "the dark energy perturbations on the other hand will eventually encounter their sound horizon if @xmath40 . once inside the sound horizon",
    ", they will stop growing .",
    "this means that the dark energy perturbation spectrum is cut off on small scales .    to get a solution on small scales , @xmath41 , we start again with the equation for the velocity perturbation . however , we expect the two terms with @xmath42 to cancel to a high degree to avoid large velocity perturbations , or in other words = - = ( 1+w ) _ _ 0 .",
    "[ eq : dpsh ] we find that the dark energy perturbations stop growing and become constant inside the sound horizon .",
    "the velocity perturbations are now given simply by using eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) and inserting eq .",

    "[ eq : vsuper ] the extra term in brackets in eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) is not important for the scales of interest here .",
    "finally , we would like to remind the reader that these results have been obtained under the assumption of a time - independent @xmath0 and @xmath9 . on the other hand , a @xmath28 dependence of @xmath9 is allowed .    as the horizons grow over time , a fixed wave number @xmath28 will correspond to a scale that is larger than the causal horizon , @xmath37 , at early times , and",
    "eventually it will enter the causal horizon and later the sound horizon .",
    "this makes it possible to illustrate the behavior of the perturbations in the different regimes in a single figure : in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltas ] we plot the numerical solution for the dark energy density contrast for @xmath43 as well as the expressions ( [ eq : dsub ] ) and ( [ eq : dpsh ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see how the perturbations start to grow inside the causal horizon but how the growth stops when the sound horizon is encountered and pressure support counteracts the gravitational collapse .",
    "matter domination was a crucial ingredient to compute the behavior of the dark energy perturbations , since the gravitational potential @xmath45 is constant while matter dominates the expansion rate and the total perturbations .",
    "however , dark energy comes to dominate eventually , and then the potential starts to decay and the perturbations grow more slowly or start to decrease .",
    "this is also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltas ] at very late times where the numerical solution for @xmath46 starts to decrease .",
    "it is difficult to capture this behavior accurately .",
    "but in @xcite we introduced the variable @xmath47 to describe the change of the gravitational potential due to the dark energy perturbations .",
    "@xmath44 is defined through k^2=-4ga^2 q _ m ( _ m+v_m ) [ eq : q_def ] if the dark energy or modification of gravity does not contribute to the gravitational potential ( for example if the dark energy is a cosmological constant ) then @xmath48 .",
    "otherwise @xmath44 will deviate from unity , and in general it is a function of both scale and time .    introducing the comoving density perturbation @xmath49 , and looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) we see that we can compute @xmath44 with q - 1 = . just using the results during matter domination , we find that the resulting expression for @xmath44 is surprisingly accurate even at late times ( see fig .  [ fig : qtot ] ) .",
    "the reason is that both fluids , dark energy and matter , respond similarly to the change in the expansion rate so that most of the deviations cancel .",
    "we find that the sub - soundhorizon expression below is accurate at the percent level , while on larger scales there are deviations of about 10 to 20% by today ( depending on @xmath0 ) .",
    "the latter can be corrected `` by hand '' in order to obtain a more precise formula , but the expressions are sufficiently accurate for our purposes and we keep them as they are .    for matter , and during matter domination ,",
    "the comoving density perturbation is extremely simple , @xmath50 . for the dark energy we find _",

    "notice that the effect of the change in @xmath13 from the onset of dark energy domination at late times is expected to be larger than the the effect from the presence or absence of dark energy perturbations , but here we want to quantify only the latter",

    "the expressions we have found for @xmath44 are always power - laws in @xmath19 , which guarantees a simple form for the velocity perturbation .    even though the dark matter does not have a sound horizon",

    "the differences between the two curves come from the term @xmath114 . since the isw power spectrum depends on the derivatives of the product of the growth factor @xmath115 and @xmath116 we need to look at ( gq) = gq + gq [ eq : sigma ] the deviation of @xmath44 from @xmath61 is never enough to explain the differences between the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : isw - cls ] . indeed , taking @xmath48 while keeping @xmath104 barely changes the results .",

    "the dark energy slows down the growth of the dark matter perturbations so that @xmath121 .",
    "however , @xmath122 because of the relative increase of the dark energy density enhancing the importance of the dark energy fluctuations .",
    "the two contributions will partially cancel and so decrease the result , unless one term dominates strongly , e.g. for modes inside the sound horizon .",
    "this is the reason why the isw contribution to the cmb power spectrum decreases as the sound speed increases .",

    "[ eq : psipsi - g ] if we assume that the dark energy does not cluster ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , eq .  ( [ eq : psipsi - g ] ) reads : p_= ( ) ^2\\{g(a)}^2|p_(k ) .",

    "as expected , they do not affect the isw effect significantly in this case .",
    "for small sound speeds the dark energy perturbations partially cancel the contribution from @xmath124 and decrease @xmath125 by about 30% for scales above the dark energy sound horizon .",
    "their slower growth inside the sound horizon leads to a smaller cancellation , as can be seen in fig .",

    "overall , it seems that @xmath104 can provide a more sensitive probe of the dark energy perturbations than @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we have derived simple analytical expressions for the behavior of the perturbations in fluid dark energy models with vanishing anisotropic stress , equations ( [ eq : vsub ] ) to ( [ eq : vsuper ] ) .",
    "these expressions are valid for models with constant @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "they were derived under the assumption of matter domination , but they allow to compute the function @xmath129 which describes the deviation of the poisson equation from the case without dark energy perturbations and which is relatively insensitive to the late - time deviations from matter domination .",

    "( [ eq : qm1 ] ) for scales larger than the sound horizon and eq .",
    "( [ eq : qm2 ] ) for scales smaller than the sound horizon .",
    "we also give a single interpolating equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qtot ] ) which is useful for fisher - matrix calculations that include dark energy perturbations . in models without anisotropic stress",
    "@xmath44 completely characterizes the dark energy perturbations and represents a fingerprint that allows to differentiate between different models with the same background expansion rate but a different evolution of the perturbations .",
    "we expect our results to hold generically for scalar - field like models .",
    "large changes can appear because of rapidly varying ( especially oscillating ) @xmath0 leading to resonance - like behavior ( see e.g. the rather contrived `` phaxion '' model in @xcite ) , for models with non - zero effective anisotropic stresses ( like dgp @xcite ) or couplings between the dark energy and the dark matter @xcite , so such models will lead to different results .",
    "we find that the dark energy perturbations are always smaller than the perturbations in the dark matter , at least by a factor @xmath34 , but on scales larger than the dark energy sound horizon they are only suppressed by an additional factor of order unity .",
    "the dark energy perturbations do not grow on scales smaller than the sound horizon , so that these perturbations are much more suppressed relative to the dark matter .",
    "the impact of the dark energy perturbations on the gravitational potential is additionally influenced by the relative energy density , so that measurable deviations tend to appear only at late times .",
    "to demonstrate the usefulness of the equations we then used the formula for @xmath44 to investigate the change in the dark matter power spectrum and the isw effect if @xmath59 .",
    "the changes in the matter power spectrum at late times are of the order @xmath130 which corresponds to a few percent on scales larger than the sound horizon of the dark energy .",
    "the growth index @xmath80 is changed by about 0.02 on the same scales .",
    "we further find that the impact on the isw effect is due to the growth of the dark energy perturbations , @xmath104 having a larger effect on @xmath75 than naively expected from the size of @xmath44 .",
    "it is much larger than the impact of the dark energy perturbations on the matter power spectrum , but because of cosmic variance it is more difficult to constrain observationally .",
    "the dark energy perturbations of the class of models investigated here vanish as @xmath131 . however , if @xmath0 is different from @xmath39 and especially if the sound speed of the dark energy is less than the speed of light , then there is hope that the effects from the dark energy perturbations could be seen with cosmological observations .",
    "although very challenging , it is nonetheless worth the effort since the perturbations provide a much more precise `` fingerprint '' of the dark energy than the equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "is supported by the swiss nsf , m.k .",
    "is supported by stfc ( uk ) .",
    "since we are dealing with linear perturbation theory , all @xmath28-modes evolve independently and for each @xmath28-mode the perturbations depend linearly on the normalization given by the constant @xmath27 . as we can choose this constant arbitrarily for each @xmath28-mode",
    ", we should really think of it as @xmath29 . in the standard cosmology",
    ", its value is set in the very early universe by inflation .",
    "this scenario then provides the initial conditions for the differential equations .",
    "however , when we compare our results with numerical solutions from e.g. camb , we have to take into account as well that the universe was radiation dominated at early times .",
    "since both the expansion rate of the universe and the dominant contribution to the gravitational potentials are different during radiation domination , we expect to find a different behavior for the matter and dark energy perturbations .",
    "it turns out that the change in the expansion rate strongly suppresses the growth rate of the perturbations , leading to an only logarithmically growing solution @xcite .",
    "this is not directly relevant to our solutions as we are content to limit our expressions to the matter dominated and later epochs .",
    "one nuisance is that we have to disregard radiation domination in some of the figures where we prefer a larger dynamical range to show the ( formal ) evolution of the perturbations in the different regimes .",
    "we note this in the figure captions where applicable .",
    "another issue concerns the normalization for comparison with numerical codes : as the perturbation growth of sub - horizon modes is delayed by the radiation dominated epoch , the @xmath28 modes which enter the horizon during that period end up with a lower normalization than expected if they are normalised at early times .",
    "the pragmatic solution here is to normalize the perturbations instead in the late universe , after the onset of matter domination , _",
    "m(a = a_1)=_in=__0(a_1 + ) which fixes @xmath29 in terms of @xmath132 at a given scale factor @xmath133 .",
    "we also note that radiation pushes the growth of both dark matter and dark energy perturbations to later times so that the ratio ( which is relevant for @xmath44 ) is basically unchanged .",
    "if a more detailed treatment is desirable , then this can be obtained by following the discussion in standard texts like e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we prefer to avoid these additional complexities here since they are not required for the main points of our work .    in this paper",
    "we are working in the newtonian gauge , but camb uses the synchronous gauge . in order to compare the camb output with our formulae , we need to transform the relevant quantities .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath134 in the synchronous gauge is related to the @xmath135 in the conformal newtonian gauge by the transformation : t^_(syn)=t^_(con ) where @xmath136 and @xmath137 denote the synchronous and the conformal newtonian coordinates respectively .",
    "the relevant transformations then are @xcite ( syn)&=&(con)- + v(syn)&=&v(con)-(1+w)k^2 + p(syn)&=&p(con)- + ( syn)&=&(con ) where @xmath138 is the energy density at background , @xmath46 is the density contrast , @xmath139 is the velocity perturbation , @xmath140 is the pressure perturbation , @xmath141 is the anisotropic stress and the function @xmath142 . here",
    "@xmath143 and @xmath144 are two scalar fields characterizing the scalar modes of the metric perturbation in synchronous gauge .",
    "this transformation also applies to individual species when more than one particle species contributes to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in the main text we were able to find simple approximate solutions to the full system of equations by neglecting certain terms , especially those linking @xmath46 and @xmath139 for the dark energy perturbations .",
    "this works very well for the parameter values of interest to us , specifically @xmath145 and @xmath146 . for @xmath147",
    "we expect rapid growth of the density perturbations from a well - known instability .",
    "this instability , however , requires exactly the coupling which we neglected . in this appendix",
    "we want to take a closer look at the `` decaying modes '' and their behavior especially for @xmath147 . for this purpose",
    "we need to revert to the full system . to allow for consistent simplifications we can then cast it in the form of a single second - order differential equation by combining eqs .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) and ( [ vp ] ) :        at the sound horizon @xmath151 so that for sub - sound - horizon modes @xmath152 , and we can neglect the contribution from the second term .",
    "@xmath153 quantifies how deep the mode is inside the sound horizon , and it will become complex for @xmath147 ( notice also that @xmath153 grows as @xmath154 ) .",
    "we are then left with : ",
    "+ ( 1 - 2w) + + + k^2=0 [ gensolut2 ] the full solution to this equation contains the one found earlier , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpsh ] ) , as well as two additional ones , _ 1 & & ( a)^-n j_n(2(a ) ) ( 3/2 - 3w ) + _ 2 & & ( a)^-n j_-n(2(a ) ) ( 1/2 + 3w ) where @xmath155 .",
    "if @xmath147 then the absolute value of the bessel functions will grow exponentially fast since its argument is complex , as expected for the instability .",
    "the interesting term here is the square root , in order to find a growing solution it needs to be real : @xmath158 .",
    "this is the case for ( 1 + 2w)^2 8 c_s^2 .",
    "this means that if we want to keep the sound speed positive we need to have an equation of state parameter that is either very negative or well larger than @xmath159 . in either case",
