    "the recent advent of the so - called precision cosmology  along with galactic observations indicate that general relativity ( gr ) with standard matter sources disagrees with an increasing number of observational data , e. g. those coming from ia - type supernovae , used as standard candles , large scale structure ranging from galaxies up to superclusters @xcite , and galactic rotation curves .",
    "in addition , from a theoretical point of view , being not renormalizable , gr fails to be quantized in any _ standard _ way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore at the extreme ultra - violet and infrared scales gr is not and can not be the definitive theory of gravitation despite the fact that it successfully addresses a wide range of phenomena and the newtonian weak field limit is correctly recovered .    in order to interpret the recent observational data in the framework of gr , the introduction of unknown _ dark matter _ ( dm ) ( to address dynamical phenomena as the formation of self - gravitating astrophysical structures ) and _ dark energy _ ( de ) ( to address the problem of cosmic acceleration ) seems to be necessary : however , the price of preserving the simplicity of the hilbert - einstein lagrangian has been the introduction of rather odd - behaving physical entities that , up to now , have not been revealed by any experiment at fundamental scales .",
    "this situation has led to several attempts devoted either to recover the validity of gr at any scale , or to construct alternative gravity theories that suitably generalize the einsteinian one .",
    "the philosophy of these two schemes is that in the former case one has to modify the matter sector introducing dm and de , in the latter approach the dynamics of the geometry ( i.e. the left - hand - side of the einstein equations ) is modified but with the constraint to recover gr at local scales .",
    "higher - order theories of gravity ( both in metric review , book , capozcurv , sante , metricrn and palatini palrn , lnr , allemandi formulations ) represent an interesting approach able to fruitfully cope with both dark matter and dark energy problems . a further approach is based on scalar - tensor theories of gravity but it can be shown that higher - order theories and scalar tensor ones can be related by conformal transformations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been widely demonstrated that such theories can agree with the cosmological observations of the hubble flow @xcite and the large scale structure evolution @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the weak field limit , the gravitational potential turns out to be modified stelle , schmidt , mannheim , noipla in such a way that interesting consequences to galactic dynamics may be achieved without violating , at the same time , the constraints on the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters coming from solar system tests @xcite .    if alternative theories of gravitation are able to explain both cosmological and local observations without the introduction of exotic energy - momentum sources , then one might ask how would the differences between these alternative theories be compared to gr with the unusual sources .",
    "it is proposed that gravitational lensing might be able to act a means for determining which theory governs the gravitational interaction , through measurements of image separations and the brightnesses of those multiple images .",
    "it is well known that the deflection of light observed during the solar eclipse of 1919 was one of the first experimental confirmations of einsteinian gr .",
    "_ gravitational lensing _",
    ", i.e. the deflection of light rays crossing the gravitational field of a compact object referred to as the _ lens _ , has become one of the most astonishing successes of gr and it represents nowadays a powerful tool capable of putting constraints on the dynamics of gravitational structures at different scales , from stars to galaxies and clusters of galaxies , and from the large scale structure to cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "if we modify the lagrangian of the gravitational field , it is obvious that gravitational lensing should be affected .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to investigate how gravitational lensing behaves in the framework of alternative theories of gravity to develop a further check on the existence of dm and de .    in particular , one has to verify that the phenomenology of standard gravitational lensing is recovered in the limit as the modified theory of gravity reduces to gr , since several observations point to the validity of gr .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that the presence of dm has to be invoked in such cases , in particular for large - scale structure ( see e.g. the case of bullet cluster @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth exploring whether deviations from the classical results for the main lensing quantities could be detected and act as clear signatures for modified theories of gravity .",
    "a preliminary study in this direction is in @xcite where the gravitational lensing , in the newtonian limit and in the jordan frame , for a generic @xmath4 is considered . in this paper",
    ", the modifications of the hilbert - einstein action are induced by corrections to the newtonian potential due to the riemann tensor .    as a first step towards such an ambitious task we consider here power - law fourth order theories ,",
    "i.e. we replace the ricci scalar @xmath5 in the gravity lagrangian with the function @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 a positive integer ) and investigate how this affects the gravitational lensing in the theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite the gravitational lensing in @xmath8 theories with a yukawa - type correction in the potential was investigated and the conclusion reached was that weak lensing could not discern between these theories and general relativity .",
    "we revisit this issue by using better lens equations together with a post - newtonian approximation , both of which can account for higher order deviations away from general relativity .",
    "we discuss weak lensing due to compact objects of the @xmath9 theory , which have been already used to analyze rotation curves of galaxies in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section provides a short summary of @xmath10 theories , focusing on the special @xmath9 case and we review the post - newtonian solution representing the compact object .",
    "the modifications from gr can be interpreted as an effective energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we discuss the referring energy conditions in the appendix .",
    "we discuss in section [ f ] how the predictions of weak gravitational lensing are different in the fourth order theory and in general relativity .",
    "for this we determine the image locations , einstein ring radii , magnification factors and the flux ratio , for various model parameters .",
    "we then demonstrate that the flux ratio as function of image separation has a different power - law dependence for each model parameter .",
    "we summarize our findings in the concluding remarks .",
