    "the proximity of m31 has made it one of the most important galaxies for the study of variable stars .",
    "cepheid studies date back more than 40 years @xcite , and continue in recent years .",
    "for example , the direct project has found hundreds of cepheids , as well as eclipsing binaries in m31 @xcite to exploit the fact that m31 provides a crucial step in the extragalactic distance ladder .",
    "variability studies of m31 have become diverse over last the few decades .",
    "these efforts include surveys for classical novae ( @xcite , and many others ) and most recently , efforts to detect microlensing events @xcite .",
    "the data from these extensive surveys for cepheids , novae , and microlensing events has provided large catalogs of the bright variable stars in m31 .",
    "the point - agape collaboration has published a catalog with 35,414 variable stars to an @xmath2 magnitude limit @xmath323 in 0.6 square degrees , not overlapping with the field discussed herein .",
    "this wide - field study determined that the variable star distribution is highly asymmetric @xcite",
    ". the direct project ( see references above ) cataloged hundreds of variable stars in 5 fields , each 120 square arcmin . my acs field overlaps with their field m31d @xcite , but the acs data is several magnitudes deeper .",
    "@xcite cataloged hundreds more variable stars in a 170 square arcmin field , and @xcite has completed a large survey for bright , long period variables in m31 , cataloging nearly 2000",
    ". their fields also overlap with my acs field , but are not as deep as my acs data .",
    "the deepest ground - based searches for m31 variables to date have been those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these surveys were sufficiently deep to study the rr  lyrae population .",
    "@xcite cataloged 37 variable stars in a search for rr  lyrae stars in the m31 halo .",
    "they found 24 rr  lyrae stars , whose magnitudes suggest that they are metal poor . their analysis suggested an rr  lyrae density of @xmath31 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "these results contrasted those of @xcite , who found 30 rr  lyrae stars in a 7 square arcminute field .",
    "their completeness analysis implied @xmath317 rr  lyrae stars arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "the deepest search to date is that of @xcite , who have used @xmath5/acs to search for variables in m31 , finding 55 rr  lyrae stars , implying a density of @xmath64 arcmin@xmath4 in their field .",
    "herein , i report the results of a search for variables in m31 with acs imaging .",
    "section 2 describes the 2-epoch acs data set used and the analysis performed .",
    "section 3 gives the results of the analysis .",
    "section 4 discusses the types of variable stars these are most likely to be , and  5 summarizes the conclusions .",
    "the data used for this project were originally obtained as part of a program to find the optical counterparts for x - ray novae in m31 @xcite .",
    "i obtained two sets of _ hst _ acs data , one observed at ut 21:35 on 03-dec-2003 and one observed at ut 16:38 on 01-mar-2004 .",
    "each of these were pointed at r.a.=00:44:07 , dec.=41:12:19.5 .",
    "the observations had orientations of 71.75 deg and 32.73 deg respectively .",
    "both observations were taken using the standard acs box 4-point dither pattern to allow the final data to be drizzled to recover the highest possible spatial resolution .",
    "all exposures were taken through the f435w filter .",
    "the total exposure times were 2200 seconds for each data set .",
    "the 9.275 arcmin@xmath7 overlapping region of the two acs images is outlined on a wide - field h@xmath8 image of m31 in figure  [ survey ] .",
    "i aligned and drizzled each set of 4 images into high - resolution ( 0.025@xmath9 pixel@xmath10 ) images using the pyraf task _ multidrizzle _ , which has been optimized to process acs imaging data .",
    "the task removes the cosmic ray events and geometric distortions , and it drizzles the dithered frames together into one final photometric image with pixel values in units of counts per second .",
    "i aligned the final photometric acs images with the coordinate system of the local group survey ( lgs ; @xcite ) by applying the iraf task _ ccmap _ to the centroids of stars and globular clusters common to the acs and lgs images .",
    "the lgs images have an assigned j2000 ( fk5 ) world coordinate system accurate to @xmath30.25@xmath9 , and they provided the standard coordinate system to which i aligned all of the data for this project .",
    "the alignment errors measured by _ ccmap _ were @xmath30.025@xmath9 , or one pixel in the drizzled images .    in order to produce acs images from each epoch with aligned pixel orientations ,",
    "i used the iraf tasks _ geomap _ and _ geotran _ to map and transform the images so that the pixels were aligned in the north up , east left orientation .",
    "i used the same objects to transform both epochs to the new pixel orientation .",
    "this technique resulted in images with identical pixel orientations and aligned to an accuracy of 0.2 pixels .",
    "since the aligned data from both epochs had the same exposure times , were taken through the same filter , and were processed with identical techniques , the images were subtracted directly to search for residual sources that were due to their brightness changing between the two observations .",
    "most bright stars left some form of residual in the difference image due to the different roll angles of the two fields and different locations of the stars on the acs detector . although these residuals had a distinctive appearance that did not resemble a point source , they severely hampered automated searches of the difference image by producing an overwhelming number of false variability detections .",
    "as these images are very large ( 10@xmath11 pixels ) , automated search routines proved slow and inefficient .",
    "preliminary visual searches of the difference image greatly reduced the number of false variability detections , increasing the efficiency and reliability of the search , with 93% of the visual candidates passing the remaining tests for variability between the two epochs ( see   [ phot ] ) .",
    "the difference image was searched twice visually for variable candidates .",
    "all residuals that appeared as point spread functions were flagged .",
    "the first search was performed with the contrast of the image set so that sources that were brighter during the first epoch appeared as black spots .",
    "the second search was performed with the inverse contrast setting , in order to find objects that were brighter in the second epoch .",
    "examples of a variable that became brighter and one that became fainter , including their appearances at both contrast settings , are shown in figure  [ search ] .",
    "the searches resulted in 141 candidates that were brighter in the first epoch and 133 candidates that were brighter in the second epoch .",
    "the fact that these numbers were within @xmath12 of one another was encouraging that the search technique was not introducing any large bias to the sample .",
    "the candidates final positions were determined with the iraf task _ imcentroid_. positions of the objects were measured with data from the epoch in which the object appeared brighter .",
    "two objects did not provide reliable centroids , suggesting that they were not strong detections and/or not point sources .",
    "these candidates were removed , leaving a final list of 272 variable star candidates to be measured .",
    "aperture photometry was performed at the _ imcentroid _ position for each candidate using the iraf task _ phot_. the aperture radius was 0.15@xmath9 , and",
    "the annulus used to measure the sky brightness was from 0.30@xmath9 to 0.55@xmath9 .",
    "the photometry was performed identically for both epochs .",
    "these measurements yielded the acs count rate for each candidate during each observation epoch .",
    "the count rates measured from the acs images were converted to vega magnitudes using the calibration provided in the acs data handbook .",
    "the vega magnitudes for the f435w filter is the acs equivalent to the johnson @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "the final conversion formula was : @xmath13 where @xmath2 is the count rate measured by _",
    "phot_. sources with @xmath14 were detected with 5@xmath0 significance .",
    "i took this to be the detection limit , only accepting detections brighter than this and assigning an upper - limit @xmath15 , to all non - detections .",
    "the final @xmath1 magnitudes from the second epoch were subtracted from those of the first , and the photometric errors were added in quadrature .",
    "no errors were assigned to non - detections .",
    "all of the candidates whose magnitudes changed by four times the root - sum - square of their errors ( or more ) were included in the final catalog of variables given in table  [ cat ] .",
    "this requirement eliminated 3 candidates from the original list , reducing the catalog to 269 variable stars .",
    "finally , for all cases of stars detected in only one epoch , the four dithered acs exposures of the detection epoch were inspected to ensure that these detections were not cosmic - rays or artifacts from the image processing .",
    "real stars were seen in all of the individual raw exposures , while cosmic rays and artifacts were not .",
    "these inspections found 15 of the variable candidates to be spurious : cases where _ multidrizzle _ had failed to properly reject a cosmic ray or artifact .",
    "the final catalog therefore contains 254 candidate variable stars .",
    "the photometric properties of these variables are shown in table  [ phottab ] and figure  [ bdb ] .",
    "they follow the expected pattern , as the smallest detected change in magnitude increases with increasing @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "these statistics provide further confirmation that the search technique did not introduce any significant bias into the sample .",
    "comparisons of this catalog with the three previous overlapping surveys show that five variables from the @xcite catalog and 6 variables from the @xcite catalog lie within the 9.28 arcmin@xmath7 variable - sensitive portion of my data set .",
    "two of the six @xcite survey variables were identified here as well , and all five of the @xcite variables were identified here .",
    "four of the @xcite variables were not seen ( v346 , v351 , v352 and v354 ) , and five of the @xcite variables were not seen ( 44001 , 44008 , 44020 , 44044 , and 44045 ) , possibly because of the differing bandpasses of their surveys which were completed in @xmath16 and @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "all of the variables of @xcite were independently identified here .",
    "one source ( direct v4599 m31d ) was culled from my catalog when _ imcentroid _ did not converge on its center in the acs image , suggesting that it is blended or extended .",
    "the six previously - cataloged variables , including names and photometry from the previous identifications , are provided in table  [ previous ] .",
    "the final catalog of 254 variable stars in these 9.28 arcmin@xmath7 of m31 is shown in table  [ cat ] .",
    "names were determined using the an iau - approved acronym ( m31acsv ) followed by truncated j2000 coordinates in an iau - approved format ( jhhmmss.s+ddmmss ) .",
    "the variables range in brightness from @xmath18 , and they show brightness changes @xmath19 mag .",
    "the distribution of brightnesses and brightness changes are shown in figures  [ bdb]-[dbn ] and discussed in   [ discussion ] .",
    "one important note about figure  [ bdb ] is that , even though all of the brightness changes seen in this survey are lower limits , only those that were not detected in one of the two observations are marked as lower limits .",
    "the density of variable stars in this small region of m31 is at least 27 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "this is about twice as high as that seen by @xcite in a field 51@xmath20 from the nucleus .",
    "the higher density is not unexpected , as the field observed is only 17@xmath20 from the nucleus .",
    "this sample likely contains many types of variables , but only those that vary by more than 0.15 mag .",
    "some could be novae , but as the observed nova rate for the entire galaxy is only @xmath21 yr@xmath10 @xcite , clearly the bulk of the variables in this tiny fraction of m31 are not novae .",
    "most of these variables are likely pulsating stars and eclipsing binaries .",
    "pulsating variables in this magnitude range that exhibit high - amplitude variability include cepheids , irregular variables , type ii and anomalous cepheids , rr  lyrae stars , high - amplitude @xmath22 scuti stars ( hads ) , and long period variables ( lpvs ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "well - sampled lightcurves will be needed to obtain reliable source classifications ; however , assuming eclipsing binaries randomly populate the @xmath23 plane in low numbers , the relative numbers of some types of variable stars can be roughly estimated based on the @xmath23 diagram .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ bdb ] shows the @xmath23 plane divided into areas , each labeled with the type of variable star that most likely occupies it .",
    "eclipsing binaries can lie anywhere in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "while these labeled areas are not reliable classifications , they provide a guide regarding where certain types of stars most likely fall in the figure .",
    "this section discusses the justification of these labels .",
    "the six stars that reached @xmath24 ( j004400.3 + 411309 , j004401.0 + 411132 , j004402.5 + 411137 , j004404.0 + 411353 , j004408.0 + 411243 and j004408.4 + 411347 ) would be easily detectable in ground based images .",
    "four of these stars ( j004401.0 + 411132 , j004404.0 + 411353 , j004408.0 + 411243 and j004408.4 + 411347 ) were previously cataloged ( see table  [ previous ] ) .",
    "the other two ( j004400.3 + 411309 and j004402.5 + 411137 ) changed in brightness by less than 0.5 mag , which could be difficult to detect in ground - based photometry .",
    "fainter variables would be quite difficult to detect in ground - based surveys because of the effects of crowding .",
    "the two other variables that were previously cataloged were observed in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands , where they have @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "those stars with @xmath26 are brighter than rr  lyrae stars in m31",
    ". these stars may be type ii cepheids and/or anomalous cepheids @xcite .",
    "these types of cepheids are typically fainter than type i cepheids and brighter than rr  lyrae stars .",
    "their amplitudes of variation are similar to rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the catalog contains 16 newly - discovered variable candidates that may have these characteristics ( 23@xmath2724.5 ; @xmath28 ) .",
    "although some of these stars could be bright lpvs , the magnitudes of these stars in this study make them the best type ii and anomalous cepheid candidates in the catalog .",
    "the histogram in figure  [ bn ] exhibits a clear peak at @xmath29 .",
    "the density of variables appears to increase sharply at magnitudes fainter than @xmath30 or m@xmath31 .",
    "the density increases from 2.2 arcmin@xmath4 mag@xmath10 to 14.6 arcmin@xmath4 mag@xmath10 as @xmath1 goes from 24 to 25 .",
    "this increase is in proportion to the increase in the stellar density , which goes from 220 arcmin@xmath4 mag@xmath10 to 1210 arcmin@xmath4 mag@xmath10 over the same magnitude range .",
    "these numbers show that at least @xmath31% of the stars in this region of m31 with @xmath32 are variable .",
    "some of the decrease in the number of variables found at magnitudes fainter than @xmath33 is due to the limitations of the search technique at those magnitudes on this data set .",
    "variables fainter than @xmath33 are more likely to be mistaken for noise in the difference image , and as can be seen in figure  [ bdb ] , stars with @xmath34 must change in brightness by @xmath350.5 mag to pass all of the variability criteria .    although the peak in the brightness distribution can be explained by completeness effects , it is interesting that the peak is at @xmath29 . with a distance modulus of 24.47 and a typical extinction of @xmath36 mag @xcite",
    ", this brightness corresponds to m@xmath37 , typical for rr  lyrae stars with a range of metallicities according to the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation @xcite . allowing for the possibility that rr  lyrae stars in this field may cover a range in metallicities from @xmath38[fe / h]@xmath390 ( including disk and halo populations ) ,",
    "they may cover a range in luminosities from 0.3@xmath401.0 .",
    "the errors in the slope and zero point of the luminosity  metallicity relation were included in the determination of this range .",
    "in addition ,",
    "rr  lyrae stars could have amplitudes as great as @xmath41 ( e.g. , aq lyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the space density of rr  lyrae stars in the solar vicinity is 6 kpc@xmath42 @xcite . with an inclination of 77 degrees , assuming a disk thickness of 1 kpc , 1 arcmin@xmath7 of m31 corresponds to @xmath30.2 kpc@xmath43 . therefore ,",
    "12 rr  lyrae arcmin@xmath4 from the m31 disk should be seen .",
    "if the rr  lyrae density of the @xcite field ( @xmath34 arcmin@xmath4 ) is added to this disk estimate , rr  lyrae stars should account for _ more than _ 5060 of the variables in this catalog , as the present field is in a more dense region of m31 than the @xcite field .",
    "assuming foreground extinction @xmath44 and a range of @xmath45 colors from 0 to 0.5 , rr  lyrae stars are likely to occupy the @xmath46 and 24.5@xmath4726.5 portion of figure  [ bdb ] .",
    "this section of the plot contains 175 stars , suggesting that the catalog includes a large fraction of the rr  lyrae stars in this region of m31 .",
    "in addition , this section of the plot may contain some faint type ii and anomalous cepheid stars , as well as bright hads .",
    "hads are distinct from rr  lyrae stars in that they are typically population i and have shorter periods ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these stars range in spectral type from a2f0 ( 1.3@xmath48m@xmath493.0 ) , and can be as much as 2 magnitudes brighter than the main sequence @xcite . therefore bright hads can overlap with the magnitude range covered by rr  lyrae stars , adding to the number of potential rr  lyrae stars in the catalog .    finally , many of these variable sources could be lpvs or eclipsing binaries .",
    "lpvs likely account for a large number of the variables in the catalog , as @xcite found them to be common in their acs field .",
    "these stars have 1@xmath503 , can exhibit @xmath1 magnitude variations of greater than 4 magnitudes , and have maximum luminosities of @xmath51 @xcite . with only 2 epochs of photometry ,",
    "lpvs are likely present at all b@xmath52 magnitudes fainter than @xmath324 , and the highest amplitude variables , with @xmath53 mag , are the most likely to be lpvs or eclipsing binaries .",
    "the 2-epoch @xmath54-band ( @xmath1 equivalent ) photometric properties of an @xmath5 acs field in m31 have been measured , resulting in a catalog of the positions and magnitudes of 254 likely variable stars in 9.28 arcmin@xmath7 .",
    "this catalog provides a starting point from which to study the variable star population of this region of m31 at rr  lyrae magnitudes .    with only 2 epochs of photometry",
    ", the variable sources can not be individually classified ; however , with just two epochs there appears to be a high density ( @xmath3527 arcmin@xmath4 ) of variable stars in m31 .",
    "four of the brightest variables are previously known periodic variables , including one cepheid .",
    "the other bright variables could be bright irregular , periodic , eclipsing binary , type ii cepheid , or anomalous cepheid stars .",
    "a comparison of the density of variables in this catalog at rr  lyrae magnitudes with the density of such stars in the galaxy and in previous m31 surveys suggests that this catalog includes most of the rr  lyrae stars in this portion of m31 .",
    "additionally , the catalog likely includes many lpvs , along with some high - amplitude @xmath22 scuti stars and eclipsing binaries .",
