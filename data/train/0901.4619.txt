    "over the last years , a lot of progress has been achieved in the study of transition metal oxides on frustrated lattices .",
    "interest in these systems stems from the richness of their novel properties : the unexpected variety of ordered states and transitions between them , and the complexity of the underlying physics .",
    "transition metal oxide ( tmo ) spinels ab@xmath2o@xmath3 , with magnetic b ions forming a pyrochlore lattice , give the unique possibility to explore how the natural tendency of correlated systems to develop magnetic , orbital , and charge order is effected by geometrical frustration .",
    "@xcite the best studied example of tmo spinels , and historically the first one , is magnetite @xmath4 which shows a high curie temperature and undergoes the verwey transition at @xmath5  k.  @xcite    within the lda+u framework ( @xmath6  ev ) .",
    "the electron density of the most populated @xmath7 orbital is plotted .",
    "lattice constants are taken from ref .",
    "the orange bonds represent the shortest bonds in the distorted structure , and the corresponding atoms are displayed in red ( ti ) , blue ( o ) and white ( mg ) . ]",
    "recently , b - spinel @xmath1 , which is characterized by a pyrochlore lattice of ti@xmath8 magnetic ions with one single electron in the @xmath7-manifold , has attracted much attention due to a very peculiar phase transition from a metallic to a spin - singlet insulating phase near    @xmath9  260  k.  @xcite the signature of the insulating state is the optical gap ( @xmath10 0.25  ev at t=10  k ) observed in optical conductivity spectra .",
    "@xcite taken together , dc - resistivity  @xcite and optical  @xcite measurements consistently indicate that @xmath0undergoes a sharp metal - insulator transition ( mit ) with no sign of drude weight at low frequencies below @xmath11 .",
    "the mit is accompanied by a structural transition from cubic to tetragonal symmetry , with a concomitant drop of the magnetic susceptibility and a resistivity jump below @xmath11 .",
    "neutron diffraction and x - ray measurements  @xcite indicate spin - dimerization : ti - ti dimers are formed in a helical pattern in the spin - singlet state .",
    "further structural refinements  @xcite reveal that ti - ions move away from the center of the tio@xmath12 octahedron .",
    "in the low - t phase two out of six ti - ti bonds gets closer , suggesting the formation of chemical dimers .",
    "these findings have suggested a removal of the pyrochlore degeneracy by a 1d helical dimerization of the spin pattern , with spin - singlets ( dimers ) located at short bonds .",
    "there were several theoretical attempts to understand the nature of spin - dimerization and the origin of the mit in @xmath1 .",
    "khomskii and mizokawa  @xcite assumed that the system is close to an itinerant state , and explained the formation of the nonmagnetic spin - singlet state by exploiting the concept of a _ orbitally driven peierls state _",
    ", leading to the formation of quasi 1d bands . in this case , the magnetic changes across the structural transition in @xmath0can be understood within the picture of 1d peierls transition driven by the ordering ( fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ) of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "this picture is consistent with b3lyp functional ( gga ) calculations  @xcite for the tetragonal phase of @xmath1 , showing that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 orbitals are occupied while the @xmath17 states are pushed to high energies .",
    "another approach is based on the assumption that the low - temperature tetragonal phase of @xmath0is mott insulator .",
    "@xcite in this case , the ground state of @xmath0can be found by studying an effective low - energy spin - orbital super - exchange hamiltonian .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the orbital degrees of freedom in @xmath0modulates the spin exchange couplings , providing an explanation for the helical spin - singlet pattern observed in .",
    "@xcite it appears that the minimum energy configuration corresponds to such an orbital ordering for which the maximum number of spin - singlet dimers is formed . however , there are various dimer coverings of the pyrochlore lattice which have the same energy . as in spin - peierls systems , the increase of magnetic energy gain",
    "can be achieved by the shortening of bonds , where dimers are situated .",
    "therefore , each type of dimer coverings corresponding to a particular orbital ordering induces a different distortion of the lattice , which costs a different elastic energy .",
    "the ground state is chosen simply by finding a minimum energy state , which in case of @xmath0corresponds to the minimal enlargement of the unit cell .",
    "however , no theoretical studies have been yet performed in order to understand the origin of the mit and the formation of the spin - singlet state .",
    "is it the intrinsic lower dimensionality of @xmath0that causes the formation of the spin - singlet state , or is the driving mechanism of different type ?    in this work , in order to address these questions , we perform quantitative investigation of the band structure of @xmath1 .",
    "using local ( spin ) density approximation plus hubbard u , l(s)da+u , approach ,  @xcite we show how an explicit incorporation of electronic correlations allows for a realistic description of the insulating ground state of @xmath1 .",
    "our results reveal that electronic correlations are fundamental in stabilizing the dimerized ground state of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that mit is driven by correlation ( via lda+u ) induced orbital order ( oo ) rearrangement . therein , u controls band splitting towards an orbital - insulating state _ without _ full orbital polarization ( op ) . in our picture",
    "oo stabilizes the spin - singlet ground state , which in turn controls the degree of structural distortions .",
    "this finding is consistent with the superexchange spin - orbital description .",
    "@xcite the opening of the electronic band gap is understood in terms of an orbital - selective mit  @xcite on a quasi 1d network .",
    "to elucidate the interplay between spin , orbital , and charge degrees of freedom in @xmath0we perform _ correlated _ scalar - relativistic band - structure calculations using local ( spin ) density approximation plus hubbard u , l(s)da+u , approach .",

    "experimental atomic positions @xcite for the tetragonal @xmath22 low-@xmath23 phase were used in the calculations .",
    "the radii of the atomic spheres were chosen as @xmath24 ( mg ) , @xmath25 ( o1 , o2 ) , and @xmath26 ( ti ) a.u . in order to minimize their overlap .",
    "our results for the paramagnetic ( lda+@xmath27 ) phase of @xmath1  are presented in fig .",
    "therein the evolution of the @xmath28 correlated density of states ( dos ) is shown . in cubic spinel oxides",
    "the @xmath29-electron orbital sector splits into the low - energy @xmath7 and high - energy @xmath30 orbitals . below",
    "we will denote the @xmath7 orbitals in the tetragonal phase as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , which differ from the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the cubic phase ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding dos are plotted in red ( @xmath31 ) , orange ( @xmath32 ) , and blue ( @xmath33 ) in fig .",
    "the dos with dominant @xmath37 contribution are shown by green and cyan curves . due to partial oxygen relaxation",
    ", the crystal field has also a small trigonal component , which further splits the @xmath7 manifold into @xmath38 and @xmath39 sectors .",
    "@xcite we note that the @xmath32 orbitals directed along one of the short ti ",
    "ti bonds can only be formed as a linear combination of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 orbitals .",
    "according to lda results for cubic @xmath0the occupation of the @xmath39 states is appreciably higher than that of the @xmath38 one .",
    "already in lda calculations for the dimerized phase , the degeneracy of the @xmath39 orbitals is lifted as a consequence of the local distortion of tio@xmath12 octahedra and overall tetragonal symmetry .",
    "one of them ( orange curve in fig .",
    "2 ) acquires @xmath32 character and becomes more populated than the @xmath33 one ( blue ) .",
    "the @xmath31 orbital ( red ) , originating from the @xmath38 state , forms a peak just above the fermi level ( @xmath40 ) , its occupation being less than that of the other two .",
    "this picture does not change much in the weak correlation regime ( @xmath413 ev ) .    with increasing @xmath27 ( @xmath42  ev ) transfer of spectral weight",
    "significantly modifies the weakly correlated scenario such that the @xmath32 orbital is now almost half filled ( @xmath43 ) , whereas @xmath33 and @xmath31 states are pushed towards the @xmath37 bands , reducing the @xmath44 charge transfer gap . in this large @xmath27 regime",
    "the overall electronic bandwidth is enhanced , accompanied by a reduction of the dos near @xmath40 and selection of a single orbital channel to form the insulating state .",
    "we observe a clear tendency towards a pseudo - gap formation in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels ( @xmath45  ev ) , while the @xmath31 orbitals are pushed to higher energies .",
    "this indicates op as the precursor of the mit . by further increasing @xmath27",
    "we obtain an insulating state at @xmath20  ev .",
    "our paramagnetic insulating solution is characterized by an almost half filled @xmath32 band , with appreciable splitting between occupied bonding and unoccupied antibonding states .",
    "the bonding - antibonding splitting observed at large @xmath46  ev ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) aids the formation of the charge gap .",
    "the insulating state can be viewed as a consequence of strong hopping between the @xmath32 orbitals along the short ti ",
    "ti bonds , leading to robust singlet character of these bonds ( see discussion below ) along the @xmath47-axis .",
    "thus , according to our results @xmath0undergoes an orbital selective mit ,  @xcite which is caused by correlation assisted orbital rehybridization .",

    "@xcite    in the idealized pseudocubic ( pc ) phase all atoms are arranged as in the high - t cubic structure supplemented by a reduced @xmath22 tetragonal space group .",
    "this combination of atomic arrangements and crystal symmetries allows for the discovering of novel magnetic and orbital reorientations in the undistorted pyrochlore structure of @xmath1 , which are in principle allowed in the vicinity of the mit point .",
    "@xcite    ev in the antiferro - pseudocubic phase ( upper panel ) and in the antiferro - dimerized phase ( lower panel ) of @xmath1 .",
    "within dimers , dos of different sites are mirror images with respect to spin space . ]    the orbital resolved dos of the pc structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) shows large op and a small charge gap between the ground @xmath50 and the first excited @xmath31 orbital .",
    "notice the dramatic rearrangement of the minority states of the ground state orbital , which are shifted to energies above 3  ev .    within the tetragonal metric of the low - t phase we find a similar evolution for the magnetically - ordered electronic dos as for the pseudocubic regime .    in the lower panel of fig",
    "[ fig3 ] we display the ground - state oo in the distorted phase of @xmath1 .",

    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 shows , however , that the canting of the @xmath32 orbitals away from the ti  ti bond plane becomes signicantly smaller when the low-@xmath23 structural distortions are taken into account . also , the average ti  o distance in the @xmath32 plane ( 2.068  ) is appreciably larger than in the @xmath33 ( 2.052  ) and @xmath31 ( 2.041  ) planes , which means that the occupation of the @xmath32 state becomes energetically more favorable .",
    "this suggests a novel scenario for quasi 1d chains  @xcite in the strongly frustrated network of @xmath1 , where the crystal - structure itself gets modified by the onset of oo .",

    "[ fig3 ] , in which the order along intermediate bonds is afoo with fm spin order .    the dimerization of afm spin chains and the formation of spin - singlets located on short bonds explains the crystal structure of @xmath0 , which can be seen as a collection of helices running along the @xmath47 axis .",
    "this helix is formed by an alternation of short - long - short - long bonds as found in .",
    "@xcite as a consequence of the selective bond shortening superstructure features like tetramers can be recognized ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the static calculations have provided evidence on the role of electronic correlation in the formation of the spin - singlet state . to further unravel the coupling between structural rearrangement and correlation - assisted oo , we have performed full structure relaxation in the correlated lda+u potential . starting from the cubic structure with pyrochlore sublattice , parrinello - rahman @xcite ( pr )",
    "structure relaxation @xcite was performed .",
    "the lagrangian formulation of pr allows for constant - pressure relaxation simulations , as variation of size and shape of the simulation box are allowed .",
    "this is typically used in connection with pressure - induced phase transitions . here",
    "@xmath27 is acting as some sort of `` pressure '' on the orbital channels , whose rehybridization brings structural changes about . to properly capture this effect",
    "it is thus important to dispose of a molecular dynamics setup allowing for unbiased geometry changes .",
    "for @xmath6  ev structural lock - in into the tetragonal dimerized phase is achieved with selective shortening of a subset of bonds ( _ molecular dimers _ ) as displayed in fig .",
    "the role of local coulomb interaction @xmath27 as symmetry - reducing agent through selection of one orbital channel is apparent in the frame of the dynamic calculations .",
    "the found dimensional reduction selects thus a particular topological order among the various `` degenerated valence bond configurations '' , allowed in the quantum dimer framework of frustrated lattices,@xcite in agreement with experiments .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the ground state orbital , charge and magnetic properties of @xmath0using the lda+u technique .",
    "our results suggests an orbital selective  @xcite picture for the metal - insulator transition of @xmath1 , which is driven by large spectral weight transfer due to correlations ( via lda+u ) .",
    "this in turn introduces a new type of bonding - antibonding splitting near the fermi energy , which is characterized by large orbital polarization of excited orbitals . using the lsda+u results we have computed the orbital order pattern in both high - t pseudocubic and dimerized phase .",
    "the insulating low - t phase is shown to be driven by electron correlations in concert with spin and orbital order .",
    "the existence of short ti - ti distances along the @xmath47-axis follows as a consequence of spin dimerization on bonds ( molecular dimers ) .",
    "finally , consistent with x - ray diffraction experiments  @xcite the resulting superstructure features ( tetramers , spirals ) are shown to be carried by correlation over orbital order , explaining magnetic and structural properties of @xmath0 in its low - t insulating phase .",
