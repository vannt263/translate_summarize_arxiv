    "one of the fundamental properties of qcd is the shrinking of the coupling constant as the energy of the interactions grows ( asymptotic freedom ) .",
    "this implies that perturbative techniques can be used to study high energy hadronic or leptonic phenomena . in spite of this",
    ", we can not rely completely on perturbation theory because the fundamental particles whose interactions become weak at high energy are deeply bound inside the hadrons we use as beams , targets or as observables .",
    "the solution is given by the factorization theorems , whereby cross sections can be expressed as the products of factors , each one involving phenomena appearing at different energy scales .",
    "a generic hadronic collisions with production of one hadron inclusive can be expressed as the convolution of the partonic hard cross section and structure and fragmentation functions , which represent respectively the parton density inside the hadrons and the hadron density inside the parton .",
    "those parton model distributions acquire a scale dependence when the qcd corrections are included , the scale being the point where collinear initial ( final ) state divergencies are subtracted . moreover these distribution are indipendent of the specific reaction .",
    "the universality of these distributions is a key property , since they are not calculated from first principles as they contain non - perturbative information .",
    "nevertheless they evolve with the scale following alterelli - parisi type equations and this permits to extract them from a low - energy process and use them to predict rates for another one .    in this talk",
    "i ll concentrate on some recent sets of parton fragmentation functions into light mesons .",
    "these sets have been extracted from real and simulated @xmath0 data in a full nlo formalism .",
    "they have been used to predict inclusive single particle differential distributions at different energies and machine and to study jet fragmentation properties .",
    "the outline of the talk is the following : i ll describe briefly how the sets have been derived , then i ll give some results on the inclusive single particle predictions comparing with data when they are available .",
    "parton fragmentation functions are defined as the density probability to find a hadron @xmath1 inside a parton @xmath2 .",
    "they are parametrized in the following form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fraction of parton momentum carried by the hadron , while @xmath5 is the scale the function is evaluated .",
    "they satisfied multiplicity , charge and momentum conservation sum rules and evolve following altarelli parisi type equation .",
    "this means that given a certain set of input functions at the scale @xmath6 we can obtain the functions at any desired scale simply solving the ap equation . to obtain the input sets we need to rely on experimental informations , because ff are not calculable from first principle , owing the fact that they contain non - perturbative informations .    to extract the ff we use @xmath0 data . in the language of the qcd - improved parton model , in fact",
    ", the @xmath4 distribution of the process @xmath7 emerges from the @xmath4 distribution @xmath8 of @xmath9 through convolution with @xmath10 :    @xmath11 where @xmath12 and    @xmath13\\right\\}\\ ] ] and    @xmath14\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are shown in reference @xcite and represent the nlo corrections . using real and simulated@xcite data several different sets have been derived for neutral@xcite and charged pions@xcite , neutral and charged kaons@xcite and @xmath19 mesons@xcite at different reference scales . in figure 1 and 2",
    "we give some examples on how well the different sets , when convoluted with the partonic cross sections , agree with @xmath0 data .",
    "we refer the readers to the previous references for further details .",
    "as already stated , fragmentation functions are process independent : this means that we can use them to make predictions for process different from the one we used to extract them .",
    "we simply need to convolute them with the appropriate partonic cross sections . in the previous references",
    "the different sets have been used to give predictions on inclusive single particle production in hadron - hadron , hadron - lepton and photon - photon@xcite collisions , and to phenomenologically describe jet fragmentation properties . in figures 3 , 4 and 5",
    "we show again some examples on the nlo predictions for different energy ranges and process types .",
    "= 5.5 cm    = 5.5 cm    finally , in order to disentangle the fragmentation properties and the hadronization mechanism of high @xmath20 jets , we consider the ratio between the single hadron and jet cross sections , for fixed values of the variable @xmath21 .",
    "then , using the cone jet algorithm and the nlo evaluation of the jet cross sections of ref .",
    "@xcite , we present in figure 6 a result on jet fragmentation in charged and neutral pions , with the energy of the jet varying between 40 and 70 gev , and a jet cone radius r=0.7 centered around the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the overall theoretical uncertainty -which is not reported in figure- can be estimated to be of order 50% .",
    "we also show the analogous experimental result on jet fragmentation in charged hadrons from cdf , in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "in this talk i reviewed the results on some recent nlo sets of parton fragmentation functions into light mesons .",
    "the possibilities to use them to make reliable predictions at different type of machines has been briefly shown .",
    "this work was supported in part by the `` maria rossi '' fellowship from collegio ghislieri of pavia , through the u.s .",
