    "instantaneous pulsar radio emission is strongly variable .",
    "its intensity can fluctuate on timescales as short as microseconds or even nanoseconds .",
    "the mean profile , however , is quite stable , and `` components '' of the mean profile are easy to identify .",
    "that is , strong radio pulses occur only at certain rotation phases , so that their sum produces a clear component in the time - averaged mean profile .",
    "these components therefore represent localized , long - lived `` hot spots '' in the magnetosphere , where plasma conditions are favorable for the creation of coherent radio emission .",
    "the fact that the high - energy mean profiles also show distinct components suggests that similar active regions within the magnetosphere create pulses at high photon energies .",
    "the major question is , where in the magnetosphere are these hot spots ?",
    "their locations depend critically on the physics of the magnetosphere : unshielded electric fields , plasma streams , pair creation , plasma and/or mhd instabilities can all contribute to bursts of radio and high - energy emission .",
    "are the hot spots restricted to low altitudes , in the open field line regions above the magnetic polar caps ?",
    "do they extend for large distances , out to or even beyond the light cylinder , along high - altitude caustics ?",
    "do they exist elsewhere in the magnetosphere , in regions not predicted by any current model ?    in this paper",
    "we focus on radio emission from the pulsar in the crab nebula .",
    "although this star has been widely studied at wavelengths from low radio frequencies through optical , x - rays and @xmath0-rays , no extant model of that pulsar s magnetosphere can address all of the available data .",
    "in this paper we present new observations at high radio frequencies , and use these to characterize the pulsed radio emission from the crab pulsar in as much detail as possible .",
    "we present these results as metrics against which present and future magnetospheric models should be tested .      at low radio frequencies ( below @xmath1 ghz ) and at high energies ( optical , x - ray , @xmath0-ray ) , the mean profile of the crab pulsar shows two strong features , generally known as the main pulse and the interpulse .",
    "the phase separation of the main pulse and interpulse remains approximately constant , @xmath2 of rotation phase ( radio , @xcite ; optical , @xcite ; @xmath0-rays , @xcite ) the fact that both radio and high - energy components appear at approximately the same phase strongly suggests the regions emitting both components are located close to each other in the star s magnetosphere .      in models of pulsar radio emission ,",
    "the main pulse and interpulse are usually interpreted as low - altitude emission from open field lines above the two magnetic poles of an orthogonal rotator , seen at a viewing angle @xmath3 between the rotation axis and sight line .",
    "although @xcite noted there are too few pulsars with interpulses in the observed population to be consistent with a random distribution of viewing angles , the orthogonal - rotator model is supported by polarization observations of some pulsars with interpulses .",
    "for instance , @xcite show that the swing of polarization position angle across the main pulse and interpulse in five pulsars with interpulses is consistent with the rotating - vector model @xcite and a nearly orthogonal viewing angle .",
    "however , this model does not easily fit the crab pulsar , in which the polarization position angle shows no variation with pulse phase across the main pulse or the interpulse @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rotating - vector model is further called into question for the crab pulsar by the shape of the x - ray torus within the crab nebula , which requires a viewing angle @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "because this angle is too far from orthogonal to allow the low - altitude open field lines from both magnetic poles to pass within our sight line as star rotates , the model of low - altitude polar - cap emission seems not to apply to this pulsar .",
    "models of high - energy pulsar light curves paint quite a different picture .",
    "pulsar x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves often have two well - defined , sharp peaks separated by @xmath5 to @xmath6 in pulse rotation phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such light curves are too common to be consistent with low - altitude emission from the magnetic poles of orthogonal rotators . in addition , the highest - energy @xmath0-rays must be emitted from well above the star s surface , because the large pair - creation opacity close to star s surface precludes their escape from low - altitude emission regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "models therefore place the emission sites at high altitudes , typically a significant fraction of the distance to the light cylinder , in an outer gap or an extended slot gap .",
    "field line sweepback and photon pile - up on caustics then creates two broad pulses ( main pulse and interpulse ) when seen at a large range of viewing and inclination angles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the crab pulsar",
    ", the phase coincidence of the main pulse and interpulse in both radio and high energy bands suggests the radio and high - energy emitting regions are regions spatially close in star s magnetosphere .",
    "this also seems to disagree with the low - altitude polar cap emission model of radio emission .      of course , alternatives to the two - pole , orthogonal rotator model have been suggested .",
    "@xcite argued that that an interpulse is just an extreme version of a two - peaked pulse arising from one magnetic pole .",
    "@xcite pointed out difficulties with the two - pole model of interpulses for psr b0950 + 08 , and noted that both one - pole and two - pole models are possible for that star . the annular gap model",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has both radio and high - energy emission coming from a mid - altitude region above only one pole .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested that both radio and high - energy emission in young , fast - spindown pulsars , comes from fan beams emitted at high altitudes in the magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite proposed that induced compton scattering of main pulse emission creates all other components in the mean profile of the crab pulsar .",
    "furthermore , the interpulse of the crab pulsar changes dramatically at high radio frequencies . above @xmath1 ghz",
    ", it shifts to @xmath7 earlier in rotation phase @xcite .",
    "the spectral and temporal nature of single interpulses is very different from that of single main pulses @xcite .",
    "we consider the low - frequency interpulse and high - frequency interpulse to be two totally separate components . even though the two interpulses are close to each other in phase , and both fall comfortably within the broad high energy interpulse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disparity between the radio characteristics of the two components suggests they arise from different regions within the pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "this is not yet the entire story of radio emission from the crab pulsar .",
    "its mean radio profile is complex , with seven separate components identified so far .",
    "we list these in order of increasing phase in table [ table : components ] , following the nomenclature of @xcite .",

    "* ) those components are typically bunched closely together in phase and are generally considered part of a single mean - profile component ( for instance within the main pulse ) . by contrast , the seven components found in the crab pulsar are widely spaced in phase , extending throughout the star s full rotation period .",
    "there are also a few pulsars , such as psr b0826@xmath834 and psr b1929@xmath910 , which emit over most or all of their rotation period .",
    "while some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested the magnetic axis of such stars is oriented close to the line of sight ( so - called aligned rotators ) , this picture is not necessarily consistent with the observed position angle behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the mapping from magnetospheric position to rotation phase is far from linear , the wide phase spread of the crab s components suggests that many separate radio emission sites exist throughout the star s magnetosphere .",
    "we have not seen much discussion in the literature of where in the magnetosphere these components may arise .",
    "it has occasionally been suggested that the precursor is generated at low altitudes near the pulsar surface in the open - field - line region of the polar cap ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this suggestion agrees with caustic models which locate main pulse emission , both radio and high - energy , at high altitudes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; low - altitude emission arising close to the polar cap will lead the high - altitude main pulse emission by several degrees of phase .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite speculated that the high - frequency interpulse might arise from high altitudes , close to the light cylinder , but these ideas have not been developed far enough to test against mean profiles .",
    "we are not aware of any suggestions for the spatial locations of the other components ( the two high - frequency components , and the low - frequency component ) .",
    "while recent studies of pulsar magnetospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) do not specifically model the radio profile , the extended current sheets and dissipation regions revealed by their simulations seem very likely to be sources of coherent radio emission .",
    "our primary focus in this paper is the phenomenology of the mean radio profile of the crab pulsar .",
    "we present continuously sampled data , recorded between 9 and 43 ghz at sub - microsecond time resolution .",
    "we use these data to derive and characterize mean profiles at these high radio frequencies , and also identify and characterize the statistics of bright single pulses within the data streams . in this paper",
    "we use the term `` mean profile '' to describe the intensity as a function of rotation phase .",
    "this quantity is derived by summing the received intensity synchronously with the star s rotation period .",
    "the same data product is also often called the `` light curve '' , especially in the high - energy community .",
    "we have also recorded strong individual pulses between 0.33 and 43 ghz , at time resolution down to a fraction of a nanosecond @xcite .",
    "these occasional strong pulses emitted by the crab pulsar led to its discovery @xcite long before its periodicity was determined @xcite .",
    "these pulses have been called `` giant pulses '' , because their intensities are far greater than the typical pulse",
    ". however , there is no standard criterion for labeling these single pulses as `` giant '' , and in fact the distribution of pulse amplitudes in the crab pulsar appears to be continuous from weak to strong , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this work we will therefore just refer to `` single pulses '' , meaning those bright enough to be clearly discernible above the system noise .",
    "such pulses are relatively rare ; in most rotation periods the pulses are below the noise level .",
    "when we do detect strong , single pulses , they occur at the phase of the main pulse and the interpulse , and very occasionally at the phases of the high - frequency components .    in this paper",
    "we present the ensemble characteristics of the crab pulsar s radio emission revealed by our data .",
    "we describe our observations in section [ section : observations ] : we extend up to 43 ghz previous studies at lower radio frequencies , such as that of @xcite .",
    "in section [ results : mean_profile ] we present the composite results : mean profiles as a function of frequency , and the phases and widths of the components of the mean profile . in section [ results :",
    "single_pulses ] we present ensemble characteristics of individual mean pulses and interpulses : their arrival phase and width , their fluence distributions , and the `` burstiness '' of arrival times . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the constraints they place on current and future models of the star s magnetosphere .    in a separate paper to follow , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper 2 ) we extend our previous single - pulse work @xcite to higher frequencies and more components , by presenting new observations of bright single pulses at the phases of the main pulse , the low - frequency and high - frequency interpulses , and the two high - frequency components .",
    "we recorded pulses from the crab pulsar in observing sessions at the arecibo observatory between 2002 and 2009 , the robert c.  byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) in 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 , the jansky very large array ( vla ) from 1993 to 1999 .",
    "we used two separate data acquisition systems . to obtain continuously sampled data ( presented in sections [ results : mean_profile ] and [ results : single_pulses ] )",
    ", we used the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ) at the gbt , using receiver bands 8 - 10 , 12 - 15.6 , 18 - 22.4 , 22 - 26.5 and 41 - 46 ghz and the single linear polarization available at 28 - 32 ghz .",
    "we operated the guppi system in the `` coherent search '' mode , in which the 800-mhz bandwidth was split into 32 frequency bands .",
    "each 25-mhz band was then coherently dedispersed at the nominal jodrell bank dispersion measure .",
    "total intensity samples were then formed from each time series and every 16 samples were accumulated before being written to disk , resulting in a final time resolution of 640  ns .    to capture individual pulses at higher time resolution ( as reported in section [ subsection : single_pulse_widths ] and in more detail in paper 2 ) , we used our ultra high time resolution system ( uhtrs ) at the arecibo telescope , the gbt and the vla . in this system , a large - memory digital oscilloscope sampled and recorded the received voltages of both polarizations . a square - law detector with 20-@xmath10s time",
    "constant was used to establish a signal threshold , typically set to 6 times the smoothed off - pulse root - mean - square noise level .",
    "when the total intensity exceeded the threshold , the oscilloscope was triggered to sample and digitize the voltages at appropriate nyquist rates up to 10 gigasamples per second during a sampling window centered on the pulse component of interest .",
    "for the observations at the arecibo observatory in 2009 we also used a realtime digital dedisperser based on the casper ibob device as the oscilloscope trigger generator .",
    "the 8-bit oscilloscope - sampled data were transferred to computer disk for subsequent off - line coherent dedispersion @xcite , which allowed time resolution up to the inverse of the receiver bandwidth , about 0.2 - 0.4 ns . during the data transfer time from oscilloscope to computer disk , 10 - 30s ,",
    "the data acquisition was disabled , and no pulses could be captured . in section [",
    "subsection : single_pulse_widths ] we use data from the uhtrs to characterize widths of single pulses ; in paper 2 we present much more single pulse data taken with the uhtrs .",
    "we have extended the radio mean profiles of @xcite up to 28 ghz in order to test for the frequency dependence of the spacing and width of the mean profile components . in figure",
    "[ fig : finalprofiles3 ] we show our new profiles aligned with a selection of previously published profiles . as insufficient timing information was available , and because the observations were made at widely separated epochs , we have made two choices to align the profiles . for frequencies @xmath11 ghz ,",

    "this phase separation is based on several data sets which show a detectable main pulse as well as a high - frequency interpulse at @xmath15 ghz .",
    "although the _ mean profile _ of the main pulse is very weak above @xmath1 ghz , we have detected occasional single pulses at the phase of the main pulse at all frequencies observed , up to 43 ghz ( as in section [ subsection : pulsecounthistograms ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : finalprofiles3 ] shows that the nature of the mean profile changes dramatically between low and high radio frequencies , as follows .",
    "* the mean profile shape changes abruptly at @xmath1 ghz . the main pulse , which dominates the mean profile at low radio frequencies , nearly disappears above @xmath1 ghz .",
    "the high - frequency mean profile is dominated by the interpulse and the two high - frequency components . *",
    "the interpulse undergoes a sudden , discontinuous phase shift of @xmath7 around 5 ghz .",

    "the low - frequency interpulse shows very little phase drift with frequency .",
    "the phase separation between the low - frequency interpulse and the main pulse , measured from our mean profiles , varies by only @xmath50 between 430 mhz and 3.5 ghz . similarly ,",
    "inspection of our single - pulse data showed no evidence for phase drift with frequency between the main pulse and the high - frequency interpulse . except for the @xmath7 phase jump",
    "when the low - frequency interpulse disappears and the high - frequency interpulse appears , each interpulse remains at a nearly constant phase relative to the main pulse .",

    "the secular change of @xmath55 found by @xcite over the approximately 20 years from hankins and fowler s observations to lyne s mjd 53000 reference date is far smaller than the quoted separation estimation error of @xcite .    in the frequency transition region between the low - frequency interpulse and the high - frequency interpulse , we measured at 4.15 ghz , the main pulse to interpulse separation as @xmath56 , intermediate between the phases of the low - frequency and high - frequency interpulses . inspection of single - pulse data in this frequency range shows that both types of interpulses can occur around @xmath57 ghz ; we thus interpret the intermediate phase of the mean - profile interpulse at 4.15 ghz as the result of this mixture .",
    "similarly , neither the precursor nor the low - frequency component show any strong phase drift over the frequency range in which they appear in our mean profiles",
    ". however , the phases of the two high - frequency components increase with frequency ; at 28 ghz both high - frequency components lag their 1.4-ghz counterparts by more than @xmath58 .",
    "the approximate constancy of the main pulse - interpulse phase separation agrees with several other interpulse pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , those authors found that the main pulse - interpulse separation in psr b1944 + 17 changes significantly , by @xmath59 between 0.43 and 2.4 ghz , reminiscent of the phase drift we find in the high - frequency components of the crab pulsar .",
    "based on the phase shift in psr b1944 + 17 , in addition to polarization anomalies and synchronous nulling in the main pulse and interpulse , @xcite speculated the radio emission is either from a single magnetic pole or from high altitudes in that star .",
    "might this also be the case for the crab pulsar ?",
    "the gaussians we fitted to the components in the mean profile for phase determination can also be used to characterize the width of each component .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : component_widths ] the measured full - width at half - maximum of each fitted gaussian , as a function of frequency . to quantify the relation between width , @xmath60 , and frequency , we fitted a linear function in log space to the data points : @xmath61 , where @xmath19 is the observing frequency in ghz .",
    "we present the fitting coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 in table [ table : componentwidths ] , along with the widths at 4 ghz , evaluated as @xmath64 .",
    "the measured widths of the components are , of course , affected by data acquisition systematics , which vary from observation to observation .",
    "these include the instrumental time resolution , the dedispersion technique and the value of dispersion measure used , the accuracy of the pulsar ephemeris used to calculate the pulse periods used to form the mean profiles , and , particularly below 1 ghz , the variable scattering broadening in the crab nebula and the interstellar medium .",
    "an upper estimate of the component width broadened by scattering can be obtained by scaling the values for the scattering decay times , @xmath65 , measured by @xcite at 111 mhz over 2.5 years , as @xmath66 , and multiplying the result by 2.46 to convert @xmath65 to @xmath60 , the component full - width at half - maximum .",
    "( although some authors assume kolmogorov turbulence for the general ism , which would imply @xmath67 , the low - frequency pulse broadening of the crab pulsar is more consistent with gaussian turbulence ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using the largest value of their observed range , @xmath68 ms , we get for our lowest observation frequency @xmath69 ms , or about @xmath70 of pulse phase , which is slightly larger than the size of the plot symbols in figure [ fig : component_widths ] . since none of our observations were made during a known scattering event , we conclude that our width measurements are not strongly biased by scattering broadening .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "we find there is very little change of the component widths over the observed frequency range .",
    "the @xmath63 coefficients we find are significantly non - zero only for the low - frequency interpulse and the high - frequency component 2 , and we note that the formal fit to the low - frequency interpulse is strongly influenced by two very high s / n points at 0.43 and 1.4 ghz .",
    "thus , only high - frequency component 2 shows clear evidence for width changing with frequency .    for many pulsars the mean profile components are broader at low frequencies . for instance , @xcite fitted the half - power component widths below @xmath71 ghz in several pulsars as @xmath72 , with @xmath63 ranging from @xmath73 to nearly zero .",
    "this `` radius - to - frequency mapping '' is often interpreted as lower - frequency radio emission coming from higher altitudes within the open field line region ( but still close to the star s surface ) . at higher frequencies , however , component widths tend to stabilize ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to different systematic effects which can change with different observations , and the difficulty of establishing true power - law behavior when only a small range of fluence is sampled , the fluence distribution can vary with frequency and between the main pulse and the two interpulses .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xcite , working at 1.197 ghz , found that when the giant pulses are sorted according to their width , the main pulse distributions are best fit by two power - law indices , and the interpulse by one .",
    "also @xcite , working at 1.38 ghz , found the amplitude distributions are power - law only at the higher intensity tail of the distributions .",
    "therefore , we do not interpret these power - law indices as proof of true power - law behavior of the fluence distribution , but rather as a general indication of the relative abundance of stronger or weaker pulses in that distribution .",
    "nonetheless , despite these uncertainties , figure [ fig : indices ] shows that the main pulse and both interpulses share a modest trend .",

    "the different frequencies were not simultaneous , because they were observed on different days , but each main pulse / interpulse time series at a given frequency was extracted from data taken on one observing run . in figure",

    "the separation between bursts is highly variable ; sometimes the bursts are separated by only @xmath187 seconds , but often it is much longer .",
    "there have been observing sessions where we have seen _ no _ single pulses for several hours .",

    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : occurrence_rate ] presents the correlation between the pulse occurrence rates and the pulse fluence .",
    "a clear correlation is seen , demonstrating that brighter bursts tend to bunch together .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : occurrence_rate ] presents histograms of the pulse arrival rates , characterized as the fraction of the 2-second intervals in which a particular pulse rate was seen .",
    "these histograms show that most of the time we recorded none or a only very few pulses per second , but that occasional multi - pulse bursts were possible , especially for the high - frequency interpulse which dominates at these high frequencies .",
    "rapid fluctuations such as seen in the left panel of figure [ fig : occurrence_rate ] are often ascribed to diffractive interstellar scintillation ( diss ) in the strong scattering regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because we have the intensity time series over a wide range of wavelengths , we can determine whether diss is the cause of the burstiness we see between 9 and 28 ghz in the crab pulsar .    in figure",

    "we can also make some simple scaling estimates , following methods in @xcite also b. rickett , private communication ( 2014 ) .",
    "the exponential decay constant at 330 mhz , @xmath193s , is thought to be due to interstellar scintillation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such as we observe could be due to interstellar scintillation . for our 800-mhz guppi bandwidth",
    ", frequencies @xmath201 ghz could be affected by scintillation . however , in addition to the fact that our observed @xmath202 does not show the expected linear increase with frequency , our scaling estimates also suggest the observed burstiness is intrinsic , as follows .",
    "the correlation bandwidth allows us to predict the fluctuation timescale expected from diss , as @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the fresnel scale , @xmath205 is the distance to the scattering screen , and @xmath206 is the speed of the pulsar relative to that screen ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath207 km / s , from an hst measurement of the pulsar proper motion @xcite , predicting @xmath208 s at 330 mhz , and @xmath209 s at 1 ghz . for a sanity check",
    ", we can compare our expected fluctuation timescale at 1.5 ghz to the results of @xcite .",
    "these authors formed a time series of giant pulses detected from the crab pulsar , and measured the @xmath210 width of its acf as @xmath211 s. identifying this timescale as @xmath202 ( which they argued should be detectable at 1.5 ghz with their observing bandwidth ) , they noted their result is a factor @xmath192 shorter than expected from interstellar scintillation .",
    "they suggested the discrepancy is due to unusually high speeds of filaments within the crab nebula ; but intrinsic variability from the pulsar on shorter timescales than @xmath202 , may be another possibility .    with these scaling arguments ,",
    "we predict @xmath212 s at 10 ghz , and @xmath213 s at 30 ghz . because these timescales are",
    "significantly longer than the burstiness we observed , we believe the burstiness we observe is not due to interstellar scintillation but rather is intrinsic to the radio emission mechanism in the crab pulsar .    ]",
    "in this paper we have presented new , high - time - resolution observations of the crab pulsar , at frequencies between 9 and 43 ghz .",
    "we combined our new work with previous data taken by our group and from the literature to characterize the mean radio profile and single - pulse statistics of radio emission from the pulsar at these high frequencies .          below @xmath1 ghz ,",
    "the crab s mean profile is dominated by two bright components , the main pulse and the ( low - frequency ) interpulse .",
    "( two weaker radio components , the precursor and the low - frequency component can also be detected below @xmath71 ghz , close to and leading the main pulse in phase . )",
    "the main pulse and low - frequency interpulse are approximately phase - coincident with the two strong peaks in the pulsar s high - energy profiles .",
    "this near - coincidence of emission phases suggests the radio and high - energy emission occur in the same regions of the star s magnetosphere , but that the radio emission sites are more spatially localized ( or more tighly beamed ) than the high - energy emission regions .",
    "the mean profile is dramatically different above @xmath1 ghz ; one would hardly believe one is looking at the same star .",
    "the main pulse disappears almost entirely above @xmath1 ghz .",
    "the interpulse  which is now the high - frequency interpulse  dominates the profile .",
    "it appears at a slightly earlier rotation phase than its low - frequency counterpart , but it still sits within the broad profile of the @xmath0-ray interpulse .",
    "the two high - frequency components are also strong in the radio mean profile from @xmath57 to 28 ghz .",
    "there is no sign of any component in optical , x - ray or @xmath0-ray mean profiles at the phases of the two high - frequency components , except for a possible ( @xmath214 ) detection of the second high - frequency component in the @xmath215 gev mean profile of @xcite .",
    "we do not , unfortunately , have a ready explanation for the geometrical or physical origin of the multiple radio components we see in the crab pulsar .",
    "we therefore close by summarizing the key points about the different mean - profile components in the crab pulsar , which we hope future models will address .",
    "the transition between low and high radio frequencies is sudden , but not `` binary '' .",
    "although the main pulse disappears from the mean profile above 5 ghz , single bright main pulses can still be detected  and recorded at sub - ns time resolution  up to 43 ghz .",
    "the change in the interpulse may be sharper .",
    "we have not captured any single low - frequency interpulses above 5 ghz , nor any high - frequency interpulses below 4 ghz .",
    "we have , however , seen single examples of both interpulses  separated by a few degrees of phase  in uhtrs data taken around 4 ghz . as we suggested in section [ subsection : avprofcompphases ]",
    "the intermediate phase of the mean - profile interpulse at 4.15 ghz may reflect a mixture of both types of interpulses at that frequency .",
    "the main pulse and both interpulses occur at approximately the same phases as their counterparts are seen at optical , x - ray and @xmath0-rays , which suggests they come from similar regions in the star s magnetosphere .",
    "there are , however , important differences .",
    "both the main pulse and the low - frequency interpulse are significantly narrower in phase than their high - energy components , and each of these radio components _ lags _ the corresponding high - energy maximum by @xmath216-@xmath217s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * and references therein ) .",
    "different timing results from different authors and telescopes display some scatter , but all agree that the radio pulses lag the high - energy pulses by a fraction of a ms .",
    "the high - frequency interpulse also sits within the broad peak of the high - energy interpulse , and is also narrower than its high - energy counterpart , but it leads the low - frequency interpulse by @xmath218s , and so it _ leads _ the maximum of the high - energy interpulse by @xmath219s .",
    "radio emission from the main pulse and the high - frequency interpulse is quite unsteady .",
    "our continuously sampled data show characteristic burst times @xmath220 to 50 s at all frequencies we recorded between 9 and 28 ghz .",
    "we also found that bright bursts can bunch together ; and , conversely , the star can go `` quiet '' ( no strong radio bursts ) for at least several hours .",
    "while we can not definitely prove that the burstiness is not interstellar , the frequency independence of the burst times suggests we are seeing fluctuations intrinsic to the emission process .",
    "components of the mean radio profile are built up from the sum of many short - lived radio pulses .",
    "our uhtrs data show that bright single pulses at the phases of the main pulse and both interpulses typically last no more than a few microseconds .",
    "this is much shorter than the duration of the mean - profile components , which last several hundreds of microseconds .",
    "in addition , we show in paper 2 that more than one bright single interpulse can occur during one stellar rotation , within the phase window of the mean - profile component .",
    "thus , a mean - profile component does not represent steady radio emission distributed over an extended region in the magnetosphere ; rather , it is the _ envelope _ of where individual pulses can occur .",
    "much more can be learned by studying single pulses at sub - ns time resolution . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the high - frequency interpulse has different spectral , temporal and dispersion characteristics from the main pulse .",
    "this suggests that different physical conditions exist in the emission regions , and/or the propagation paths , for each component . in paper 2",
