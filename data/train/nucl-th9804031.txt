    "the four nucleon bound state calculations have , in the last years , reached a high level of accuracy and consistency at least as far as the solutions of the corresponding equations are concerned @xcite .",
    "this situation contrasts with the 4n scattering problem where despite some pioneering and relevant results @xcite , there is a manifest lack of convergence among the different groups and methods even when using simple interactions .",
    "this problem is not only a general extension of the 3-body one , in the sustained task of the nuclear few - body community to deal with increasingly complex systems , but we believe it constitutes a qualitative jump in our understanding of nuclear systems . indeed",
    "the continuum spectrum of the 4n system ( see figure  [ figchart ] ) , with its rich variety of thresholds and structures , provides a bridge between the relative simplicity of the a=2,3 problems and the complexity of many - body systems .",
    "even when restricted to the energies below the first 3-body breakup threshold , the presence of several resonances at each z channel , the existence of the almost degenerate p+t and n+@xmath1he thresholds with , in the middle , the first @xmath2 excitation of the @xmath3he ground state make the understanding of the a=4 chart in terms of fundamental nn interactions an exciting and redoubtable theoretical challenge .",
    "we present here the first solution of the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations in configuration space for the four nucleon scattering problem . although the results concerning the bound states ( @xmath3he and @xmath3he@xmath4 ) will be discussed in some detail ,",
    "our main interest lies in the 4n continuum spectrum , i.e. the n+nnn elastic scattering and its coupling to the first inelastic nn+nn threshold .",
    "the resolution method is based on the angular momentum expansion of the fy amplitudes and the spline expansion of their radial parts .",
    "orthogonal collocation is used to generate a linear system which is solved by iterative procedures .",
    "the scattering observables are extracted from a direct inspection of the fy amplitudes in the asymptotic region , in a natural extension of the methods developed for the three - body case in @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper have all been obtained by using an s - wave nn interaction model and the isospin symmetry hypothesis .",
    "the coulomb and mass difference effects are thus not included .",
    "this choice , guided by methodological reasons , allows a presentation of the formalism and methods in a relatively simple framework .",
    "is is remarkable , however , that such a simple model provides a very good description of low energy scattering observables even if , as in the n+t case , they are not totally trivial .",
    "some first results including realistic interactions have already been reported elsewhere @xcite and will be the subject of subsequent publications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the general formalism and the simplifications arising in the case of 4 identical particles .",
    "this section contains also the spin , isospin and angular momentum algebra . in section 3",
    "we give some details of the numerical methods used . in section 4",
    "the results will be presented .",
    "they include the @xmath3he ground and first excited state , the elastic phase - shifts and low energy parameters for the n+nnn reaction and the n+nnn  @xmath5  nn+nn first inelastic channel .",
    "the energies are restricted below the 3- and consequently 4-body break - up .",
    "conclusions and perspectives will be given in the last section .",
    "with the aim of solving the schrdinger equation for n particles interacting via a pairwise potential @xmath6 @xmath7 yakubovsky @xcite , generalizing faddeev s work for n=3 @xcite , wrote a set of equations whose solutions verify ( [ sch ] ) and which provides a proper mathematical scheme to account for the variety of physical situations involved ( see , e.g. figure [ voies ] ) . in the n=4 case ,",
    "the fy equations can be obtained by first splitting the total wavefunction @xmath8 in the usual faddeev amplitudes , @xmath9 , associated with each interacting pair : @xmath10 and requiring them to be a solution of the system of coupled equations @xmath11 or equivalently in its integral form @xmath12 with @xmath13    each amplitude @xmath9 is in its turn split in 3 parts , the fy amplitudes , corresponding to the different asymptotics of the remaining two particles : @xmath14 and obeying the following system of coupled equations : @xmath15 in which an amplitude @xmath16 , not defined by ( [ deffy ] ) , has to be understood as being identical to @xmath17 .",
    "any solution of this system of 18 coupled equations , called the fy equations , is a solution of ( [ fed ] ) and consequently of the initial problem ( [ sch ] ) .",
    "its advantage lies in the possibility to define for system ( [ fyde ] ) appropriate boundary conditions ensuring the unicity of the solution .",
    "indeed when one of the particle , e.g. labeled by @xmath18 , is out of reach of the interaction , all the amplitudes in ( [ fyde ] ) tend to zero except @xmath19 and circular permutations on @xmath20 which obey @xmath21 this system of equations , resulting from ( [ fyde ] ) , is equivalent to the 3n faddeev equations for the particles @xmath22 . in a similar way , when the @xmath23 and @xmath24 clusters are free from interaction the only non vanishing amplitudes are @xmath25 and @xmath26 and their corresponding equations in ( [ fyde ] ) tends to @xmath27    it is worth noticing that the fy amplitudes can be written in terms of the faddeev amplitudes in the form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and , according to ( [ fei ] ) , in terms of the total wavefunction : @xmath30    disregarding the internal degrees of freedom ( like spin , isospin ) , the natural basis for the configuration space is provided by the positions of the different particles @xmath31    in order to remove the center of mass motion , it is useful to introduce the relative jacobi coordinates .",
    "two sets of jacobi coordinates can be defined for each of the 4 !",
    "arrangements @xmath32 .",
    "one of k type : @xmath33 and one of h type : @xmath34 in which @xmath35 is an arbitrary mass taken as a reference , and @xmath36 is the reduced mass of clusters @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". however some of these 48 coordinate sets are redundant .",
    "for instance those obtained by exchanging @xmath39 in a k - set or @xmath39 or / and @xmath40 in the h - set are equivalent .",
    "this yields 18 ( 12k+6h ) arbitrary and physically non equivalent jacobi sets , as many as fy amplitudes .",
    "any of these coordinate sets , suitably completed with the center of mass coordinate @xmath41 , constitutes an equivalent description of the 4 particles configuration space .",
    "that provides 18 coordinate sets and the corresponding bases for the configuration space , equivalent to ( [ baser ] ) , that will be written in the form @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the degrees of freedom related to the center of mass motion separate in nonrelativistic dynamics and will be hereafter omitted .",
    "although each fy amplitude could be in principle expressed in terms of any of these bases , only one of them is appropriate for expanding it .",
    "we will denote the resulting components by : @xmath44 the bases described above have to be completed to account for other degrees of freedom like spin , isospin , etc .",
    "further details about the formalism and the relation between the different bases sets can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .      in the case of four identical particles ,",
    "the 18 fy amplitudes can be obtained by the action of the transposition permutation operators @xmath45 on two of them , arbitrarily chosen provided that one is of k type and the other one of h type .",
    "we have taken @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the 4-body problem is solved by determining the two @xmath48 amplitudes which satisfy the following equations : @xmath49\\label{fye1}\\\\ ( e - h_0-v ) h&=&v\\left [ ( p_{13}p_{24}+p_{14}p_{23 } ) \\ ; k + p_{13}p_{24 } \\ ; h\\right ]   \\label{fye2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 depending on whether the particles are bosons or fermions .",
    "the asymptotic equations , i.e. the equivalent of ( [ fya1],[fya2 ] ) are in this case @xmath51 the total wave function is then given by : @xmath52\\ ;                  \\left [ 1 + \\varepsilon(p_{14}+p_{24}+p_{34 } ) \\right]k   \\label{psi13}\\\\ \\psi_{2 + 2 } & = &   \\left [ 1+\\varepsilon ( p_{13}+ p_{23}+ p_{14}+ p_{24 } ) + p_{13}p_{24}\\right ] \\;h   \\label{psi22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each amplitude @xmath53 is considered as a function of its natural set of jacobi coordinates @xmath54 , defined respectively by equations ( [ k ] ) and ( [ h ] ) with @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57@xmath58    they are expanded in angular momentum variables for each coordinate according to @xmath59 where @xmath60 are generalized tripolar harmonics containing spin , isospin and angular momentum variables and the functions @xmath61 , the reduced radial fy components , are the unknowns .",
    "the label @xmath37 represents the set of intermediate quantum numbers defined in a given coupling scheme and includes the specification for the type of amplitudes ( k or h ) .",
    "we have used the following couplings , represented in figure  [ coupling ] : @xmath62_{t_3 } t_4 \\right\\}_t \\otimes \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_x ( s_1 s_2)_{\\sigma_x } \\right)_{j_x } ( l_y s_3)_{j_y } \\right]_{j_3 } ( l_z s_4)_{j_z } \\right\\}_{j^{\\pi } }      \\cr \\mbox{h amplitudes }   & : & \\left [ ( t_1 t_2)_{\\tau_x } ( t_3 t_4)_{\\tau_y } \\right]_t \\otimes \\left\\ { \\left [ \\left ( l_x ( s_1 s_2)_{\\sigma_x } \\right)_{j_x }   \\left ( l_y ( s_3 s_4)_{\\sigma_y } \\right)_{j_y } \\right]_{j_{xy } } l_z \\right\\}_{j^{\\pi } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the spin and isospin of the individual particles and @xmath65 are respectively the total angular momentum , parity , and isospin of the 4-body system .",
    "each component @xmath61 is thus labeled by a set of 12 quantum numbers to which the symmetry properties of the wavefunction impose the additional constraints : @xmath66 for k and @xmath67 for h. the total parity @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 in both coupling schemes .",
    "the radial equations for the components @xmath61 are obtained by projecting each of equations ( [ fye1]-[fye2 ] ) in its natural configuration space basis @xmath70 .",
    "several steps further @xcite we end with a system of coupled integro - differential equations which , most generally , can be written in the form : @xmath71 \\label{fse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 the functions @xmath73 contain all the spin , isospin and angular momentum couplings .",
    "the arguments @xmath74 are functions of @xmath75 in the more general case , and are detailed in the appendix .",
    "the system of equations ( [ fse ] ) has been explicitly written in @xcite for the case of four identical bosons .",
    "the fy components for the different ( s , t ) channels in the s - wave approximation , i.e. with all orbital angular momenta in expansion ( [ kpw ] ) equal to 0 , are listed in table  [ tab_amplis ] . in this table ,",
    "the symbols ``  @xmath5  '' and ``  @xmath76 '' denote respectively the amplitudes corresponding to an asymptotic n+nnn or nn+nn channel .",
    "note that , contrary to the 3n problem , the number of fy components appearing in ( [ fse ] ) is infinite even when the pair interaction is restricted to a finite number of partial waves .",
    "this divergence comes only from the existence of the @xmath77 additional degree of freedom in the k - like amplitudes .",
    "for all the physical problems we have considered , the boundary conditions can be written in the dirichlet form .",
    "the use of reduced radial fy components @xmath61 in ( [ kpw ] ) imposes for any kind of solution the regularity conditions : @xmath78 for the bound state problem these conditions are completed by forcing the components @xmath61 to vanish on the hypercube @xmath79\\times[0,y_n]\\times[0,z_n]$ ] , i.e : @xmath80 for the scattering problems the boundary conditions are implemented by imposing at large enough values of @xmath81 the asymptotic behavior of the solutions .",
    "thus , for the n+nnn elastic case we impose at @xmath82 the solution of the 3n problem for all the quantum numbers @xmath83 corresponding to the open asymptotic channel @xmath84 @xmath85 where the functions @xmath86 are the faddeev amplitudes of the 3n problem .",
    "indeed , at large values of @xmath81 and for energies below the first inelastic threshold , the solution of equation ( [ fyai1 ] ) factorizes into a bound state solution of the 3n faddeev equations and a plane wave in the @xmath81 direction with momentum @xmath87 , whereas the solution of ( [ fyai2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "one then has , e.g. for an s - wave , @xmath88 and the scattering observables are directly extracted from the logarithmic derivative of the k amplitude in the asymptotic region : @xmath89 provided we are in the asymptotic domain , the phase shifts thus extracted have to be independent of @xmath90 and of the amplitude index @xmath83 .",
    "this provides a strong numerical test .",
    "an additional advantage of this procedure is that it avoids any cumbersome multidimensional integrals .    in the presence of several open channels , like n+nnn and nn+nn e.g. ,",
    "several resolutions are needed .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ asym1 ] ) are simply generalized in the form @xmath91 in which @xmath92 are arbitrary real numbers and the functions @xmath93 coincide with @xmath94 if @xmath84 is a n+nnn channel or are analogous to the faddeev amplitudes for ( [ fyai2 ] ) if @xmath84 is a nn+nn channel .",
    "equation ( [ asym1 ] ) is generalized in the following way : @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the regularized hankel functions @xcite , and @xmath97 is a multiplicity number for the channel @xmath84 ( @xmath98 for 1 + 3 and @xmath99 for 2 + 2 channels ) due to the symmetry properties of the total wave function ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath100 ( amplitudes of the incoming waves ) and the s - matrix elements are the unknowns .",
    "they are obtained by identifying with the asymptotic form ( [ smatrix ] ) the values @xmath101 at @xmath82 for different solutions corresponding to different choices of @xmath102 s whose number equals the number of channels .",
    "we remark that the momenta @xmath87 appearing in equations ( [ dlogphi],[qcotd],[smatrix ] ) are the conjugate variables of the @xmath81-jacobi coordinates .",
    "they are related to the center of mass kinetic energy @xmath103 of channel @xmath84 according to @xmath104 .",
    "the physical momenta , conjugate to the physical intercluster distances , are @xmath105 or @xmath106 depending whether @xmath84 corresponds to a 1 + 3 or 2 + 2 channel .    by the definition ( [ smatrix ] )",
    "one has unitarity ( @xmath107 ) and symmetry ( @xmath108 ) relations . working with real solutions these properties are related ( unitarity implies symmetry ) .",
    "however none of them is a trivial consequence of the method used but a strong test of numerical accuracy .    in order",
    "that the factorizability takes place the asymptotic 3n or 2n+2n states have to be calculated with the same numerical scheme as that used to solve the 4-body problem .",
    "this means in practice that they are exact solutions of ( [ fyai1 ] ) or ( [ fyai2 ] ) , once the z - dynamics are removed . by doing so",
    ", the factorization property , valid only in cartesian coordinates , is an exact numerical property and leads to stable local results .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in figure  [ represnt ] in which the fy amplitudes for an n+nnn elastic scattering at @xmath109 and @xmath110 are represented .",
    "the numerical methods used are based on the hermite spline expansion , orthogonal collocation @xcite and iterative procedures for solving the linear system .",
    "an important step in their solution is the tensor trick @xcite .",
    "we look for the solutions @xmath61 of the integro - differential system ( [ fse ] ) in the form of a tensor product of 1-dimensional cubic hermite splines @xmath111 : @xmath112 defined on grids of non - equidistant @xmath113 points g@xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "a grid g@xmath116 will be defined by giving the number of intervals @xmath117 , the end point @xmath118 and the constant scaling factor between two consecutive intervals , @xmath119 .",
    "we will use the following notation g@xmath120 , often extended to multi - domain grids according to g@xmath121    the boundary conditions are easily implemented using the properties of the spline functions ( value and derivative equal to 0 or 1 at the grid points ) .",
    "they result in fixing the values of some of the unknown coefficients @xmath122 in the expansion ( [ sol1 ] ) . by exchanging the indices of the two last spline functions in each variable",
    "the solution takes the form : @xmath123 where @xmath124 are the coefficients of the asymptotic functions @xmath125 defined in ( [ asym2 ] ) . in the cases of a closed channel or a bound state these coefficients",
    "are zero .",
    "collocation points associated with the 3-dimensional grid are used to generate a linear system , the @xmath126 being the unknowns .",
    "the integral terms in ( [ fse ] ) are calculated with a gaussian quadrature rule with typically @xmath127 points in each angular variable @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in order to limit the number of parameters we have chosen @xmath130 .",
    "the number of unknowns is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the number of fy components .",
    "a rough estimation for the extreme cases of a four bosons bound state and of a scattering state in a realistic problem leads to values @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and consequently to a number of unknowns going from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "this implies the use of a dense matrix with @xmath138 coefficients .",
    "direct methods are not appropriate for solving such huge linear systems , and we have used iterative techniques , which avoid any storage or inversion of the matrix .",
    "the basic feature of any iterative method is to obtain the solution of the linear system only by iterative application of the matrix to an initial vector .",
    "this implies a complete calculation of the matrix elements each time it is necessary , and requires the intensive use of parallel computers .",
    "in the case of scattering states , the boundary conditions ( [ asym2 ] ) , responsible for the second term in ( [ phispline ] ) , generate a source term in ( [ fse ] ) leading to a regular linear system of the type @xmath139\\vec{c}+\\vec{b}$ ] , where the different @xmath140 matrices are reminiscent of the @xmath141 operators . for brevity we will write the system in the form @xmath142 .",
    "the numerical method we have chosen to solve this system is gmres ( for generalized minimum residual algorithm ) @xcite .",
    "gmres is a prototype of the so called krilov subspaces projection methods .",
    "its aim is to minimize the residue @xmath143 of an approximate solution @xmath144 , starting from a trial vector @xmath145 and looking for its correction @xmath146 in the krilov subspace @xmath147 such that the residue @xmath148 is orthogonal to @xmath149 .",
    "when the dimension @xmath150 increases , the residue of the approximate solution @xmath144 can be brought to an arbitrary small value , called tolerance . in most of the practical cases , a tolerance between @xmath151 and @xmath152 is sufficient .    gmres is a powerful tool when the problem is well conditioned , what is almost never true in a realistic case .",
    "the way out is to `` precondition '' the system , i.e. to solve the equivalent problem @xmath153 instead of @xmath142 .",
    "the closer to @xmath154 is the matrix @xmath155 , the better is the preconditioning .",
    "our choice was to take the matrix @xmath155 equal to @xmath156 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite its tensor structure , optimized by the choice of cartesian coordinates , allows an easy inversion .",
    "our preconditioning technique gives us a converged result after @xmath157 matrix applications , for all the considered physical cases and independently of the dimension of the matrix .",
    "examples of convergence curves , i.e. the evolution of the residue modulus at each step , are shown in figure  [ evolres ] .    in the case of bound state",
    ", the asymptotic behavior of the wave function and fy amplitudes leads to a singular system @xmath139\\vec{c}$ ] that will be rewritten for convenience in the form @xmath158 , the energy e being an eigenvalue .",
    "it is well known that iterative methods are appropriate for extracting a few eigenvalues , but only those with largest modulus . with the 3-dimensional box - like boundary condition ( [ bsbc ] ) , the existence of overwhelming highly positive eigenvalues leaves no hope of obtaining directly the binding energy .",
    "a crafty trick is to solve the eigenproblem @xmath159\\vec{c}=\\lambda\\vec{c}$ ] where @xmath160 is now a parameter @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath160 will be an eigenvalue of the initial problem when the spectrum @xmath161 contains 1 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown by variational considerations that the more excited the state ( including the non physical box states ) , the smaller the corresponding @xmath102 .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of physical interest can be obtained with methods like ira ( implicit restarted arnoldi algorithm ) @xcite .",
    "we notice that the full inversion of @xmath156 , including the two - body potential , gives a better conditioned spectrum @xmath161 than an inversion of its kinetic term alone , and avoids some of the awkward negative eigenvalues generated by the repulsive part of the potential .",
    "ira is a generalization of the power method and gives the first eigenvalue in @xmath162 matrix applications .",
    "it is also based on krilov subspaces , and approximates the eigenvalues of @xmath163 by those of the restriction of @xmath163 to the space spanned by @xmath164 vectors @xmath165 , @xmath166 being a trial arbitrary vector .",
    "nevertheless , this method requires several calculations for different values of the energy and becomes numerically unstable when using highly repulsive two - body potentials , like the interatomic @xmath3he-@xmath3he one @xcite .",
    "a more robust technique was finally adopted , often referred as shift - invert method .",
    "the initial problem is written in the form @xmath167 and this technique converges to the energy closest to @xmath168 .",
    "it gives very good results with a well - balanced mixture of ira and gmres .",
    "ira is used to quickly obtain the dominant eigenvalue @xmath169 and provides the energy @xmath170 .",
    "the real difficulty lies in the generation of the corresponding krilov subspace .",
    "it is obviously impossible to invert @xmath171 since the @xmath172 matrices are contained in @xmath163 .",
    "the step @xmath173 is then performed by a gmres resolution of the equivalent linear system @xmath174 .",
    "this technique presents considerable interest especially for excited states which are easily obtained , independently of the previous convergence of the less excited ones .",
    "the results presented in this section have been obtained with the spin - dependent s - wave interaction mt i - iii : @xmath175 the potential parameters and the value @xmath176 mev.@xmath177 are the same than those used e.g. in @xcite and are slightly different from those given in the original version @xcite . despite its bare simplicity , this potential turns out to be very efficient in describing the bulk of low energy properties in the few - nucleon systems .",
    "we will first examine what we call the s - wave approximation , i.e. the fact that aside from the zero angular momentum of the interaction pair , all the angular momenta variables in expansion ( [ kpw ] ) are set equal to zero .",
    "the convergence with respect the @xmath178 expansion will be examined in a second step .      in the 4n - system ,",
    "the bound states exist only for the s = t=0 channel . in the s - wave approximation",
    "the number of fy components is limited to @xmath179 ( see table  [ tab_amplis ] ) .",
    "the binding energies and r.m.s .",
    "radius for the ground ( @xmath3he ) and first excited ( @xmath3he@xmath4 ) states are given in table  [ tab_bs ] .",
    "the corresponding grids are g@xmath180 with @xmath181 and g@xmath182 with @xmath183 , given in table  [ tab_grids1 ] .",
    "the estimated accuracy in the binding energies is 0.01  mev but we notice that much less expensive calculations can provide a precise result as well ; e.g. the grid g@xmath184 with @xmath185 gives also a binding of 30.30  mev . in the ground state",
    "we remark a good agreement with the best existing calculations @xcite .",
    "the first excitation which , experimentally , corresponds to a @xmath186 resonance 0.40  mev above the p+t threshold @xcite , appears in this model as a loosely bound state .",
    "the binding energy with respect to the n+nnn threshold ( e=-8.535  mev in this model ) is 0.257  mev .",
    "a similar result was found in @xcite in which different versions of the one term separable yamaguchy potential gives a binding energy varying from 0.07 to 0.40  mev , depending on their different d - state contribution .",
    "this @xmath2 first excitation has been widely considered in the literature as being a breathing - mode @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is however different .",
    "we have calculated the regularized two - body correlation functions defined by @xmath187 where @xmath188 represents the total wave function component in the @xmath189 quantum numbers , and where @xmath190 denotes the subset of quantum numbers @xmath37 relative to the @xmath191 variable ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the summation in ( [ correlfunct ] ) is performed onto one of the two basis , k or h. once the total wavefunction is normalized , the correlation functions are normalized according to : @xmath193    the results are displayed in figure  [ figcorrel ] .",
    "the separated contributions from the singlet and triplet state are plotted for ( a ) triton ( b ) @xmath3he ground state and ( c ) @xmath3he first excited state .",
    "the difference between the correlation function for the ground and excited states is remarkable , both in the shape and in the separated singlet - triplet contributions . for the excited state one can distinguish the superposition of two structures with two different length scales , the short distance part being similar to the triton one",
    "this suggests a 1 + 3 structure for the @xmath3he excited state , as can be more clearly seen in plot ( d ) where the results of ( c ) are compared with those of the triton suitably normalized .",
    "contrary to what would happen in a breathing mode , the short distance behavior of the nucleons is that of an unperturbed triton with the fourth nucleon being simply a remote spectator .    by modifying the mt i -",
    "iii potential strength we failed to pull the state out of the bound region , the 3-body threshold moving in the same direction .",
    "it seems very difficult for a pure strong interaction to generate a first excitation in the continuum .",
    "the right position of this resonance is however a crucial point in any attempt to describe the low energy data ( e.g. p+t ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of coulomb interactions could be enough .",
    "however the inclusion of an ad - hoc repulsive 4-body term @xmath194 can also achieve the same result .",
    "the preceding results are only slightly modified by the inclusion of higher partial waves in the fy expansion .",
    "the effects of these contributions can be seen in table  [ tab_bs2 ] .",
    "their smallness shows the validity of the s - wave approximation .",
    "these results have been obtained using the grid g@xmath184 with @xmath185 for the ground state and g@xmath182 with @xmath183 for the first excitation for which the corresponding triton binding energy is @xmath195  mev .",
    "a crucial point in our method is to ensure the proper description of the 3n asymptotic state .",
    "this is used to fix the grid parameters for the @xmath196 variables . in order to exhibit the stability of our results",
    ", we will compare the phase - shifts obtained with several tritons corresponding to increasing numerical accuracies .",
    "the considered grids , detailed in table  [ grids2 ] , are t@xmath197 with @xmath183 and a binding energy @xmath198  mev , t@xmath199 with @xmath185 and @xmath200  mev , and t@xmath201 with @xmath185 and @xmath202  mev .",
    "we recall that the precise value for the 3n binding energy is @xmath202  mev .",
    "the grid parameters for the z - variable depends substantially on the relative kinetic energy .",
    "a zero energy calculation requires a relatively large value of @xmath203 but very few points inside are sufficient to describe an asymptotic linear behavior . on the contrary",
    "as far as the energy increases , the value of @xmath203 can be decreased but the oscillations in the relative wave functions demand an increasingly big number of points .",
    "a typical grid for the case @xmath204 is g@xmath205    we have shown in table  [ dephan_nnn ] the phase - shifts for different @xmath206 channels as a function of the center of mass energy .",

    "t@xmath199 has been made , showing a good stability despite the fact that grid t@xmath197 gives only a poor description of the asymptotic state . as it has been already emphasized in section 2 , the key point in our approach to the scattering problem",
    "lies in the coherence between the asymptotic state and the numerical solution of the 4n problem , rather than in a very precise description of it .",

    "they are close to those obtained in @xcite although with the original potential parameters .",
    "the remaining low energy parameters have been extracted from the phase - shifts and are given in table  [ tab_lep ] for the different @xmath206 channels .",
    "they are defined in the effective range expansion : @xmath209\\ ] ] where @xmath210 in the usual case but has to be modified in the presence of a near threshold singularity . according to @xcite ,",
    "we have taken the form ( @xmath211 real ) : @xmath212    the validity of the expansion ( [ mera ] ) in the energy region below the first inelastic threshold is displayed in figure  [ fig_kcotd ] .",
    "the usual effective range approximation , i.e. @xmath210 and the @xmath213 contribution neglected in ( [ mera ] ) , works very well in the whole energy domain for all but the @xmath214 channel , in which the existence of a near threshold @xmath3he excited state requires the explicit inclusion of the pole contribution ( [ pole ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the contributions coming from the @xmath215 term are very small and have been included only for completeness . on the contrary",
    "the pole contribution , existing only in the @xmath214 channel , is essential .",
    "expansion ( [ mera ] ) provides a very accurate parametrization of the s - wave scattering amplitude in all the energy region below the break - up threshold .",
    "we would like to emphasize here the coherence between the @xmath3he@xmath4 and the scattering results in the @xmath214 channel .",

    "these results have been obtained with the grid t@xmath199 and @xmath185 completed with a suitable z - grid .",
    "the values are well converged with @xmath221 except in the @xmath214 case , where the big value of the scattering length makes this state rather sensitive to small parameter variations .",
    "of particular interest is to apply the preceding results to the description of n+t cross section . on the one hand",
    "this is a pure @xmath208 channel , free from the difficulties related to the coulomb interactions . on the other hand accurate low energy scattering data exist @xcite , showing a structure at neutron laboratory energy @xmath222 mev which is supposed to be created by a series of p - waves resonances @xcite .",
    "the calculations discussed in the preceding section have thus been completed up to the first 3-body break - up threshold by the inclusion of the first negative parity states @xmath223 corresponding to n+t relative p - waves .",
    "the resulting total cross sections are plotted in figure  [ nt1 ] .",
    "the contributions from n+t relative s- and p - waves are distinguished .",

    "the corresponding cross sections differ only by statistical factors .",
    "the remaining @xmath225 state comes from an @xmath226 coupling . in view of these results ,",
    "several remarks are in order :    1 .",
    "the scattering lengths obtained in the s - wave approximation ( table  [ tab_sl ] ) gives a slightly overestimated value for the zero energy cross section @xmath227  b. the experimental extrapolated zero energy cross section is @xmath228  b @xcite .",
    "however the inclusion of higher partial waves in the fy expansion ( table  [ ldifl ] ) significantly reduces the s - wave approximation result to @xmath229  b in closer agreement with experiment .",
    "the comparison of the separated spin contribution is not possible since the values of the spin - dependent scattering lengths , summarized in table  [ tab3 ] , are still controversial .",
    "despite the simplicity of this model , the agreement with experimental data in the resonance region , is very good .",
    "the n+t p - waves resonances are generated by an nn s - wave interaction alone .",
    "an effective 1 + 3 p - wave potential is created due to the exchange mechanism between the four nucleon .",
    "we remark however that a first attempt to describe this cross section with @xmath230 in the k components but keeping zero all the remaining angular momenta in ( [ kpw ] ) failed .",
    "the incoming neutron seems thus to be more sensible to the virtual excitations of the triton than to the nn pair interactions themselves .",
    "we have calculated the contribution coming from the n+t relative d - waves .",
    "they are given by the positive parity states @xmath231 , @xmath232 .",
    "the corresponding phase - shifts at 6  mev c.m .",
    "kinetic energy are @xmath233 and @xmath234 , which contributes only a few mb to the total cross section .",
    "the results displayed figure [ nt1 ] can so be considered as fully converged in the mt  i - iii model .",
    "the last point to be presented in this work concerns the reaction @xmath235 in the isospin approximation employed throughout this work , both n+@xmath1he and p+t thresholds are degenerate and correspond to the n+nnn of the preceding section .",
    "the pauli principle imposes for the deuteron - deuteron channel @xmath236 .",
    "if we assume the final state d+d to be in a relative s - wave one has @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "the @xmath239 state requires a relative angular momentum @xmath240 in the initial n+nnn channel and it is expected to give small contribution at very low d+d energy .",
    "we will consider only the @xmath241 state .",
    "the s - matrix is defined according to ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "we present in table  [ smat ] the s - matrix elements at several energies , chosen with respect to the nn+nn threshold .",

    "we remark no accident in the n+nnn cross section when the inelastic nn+nn threshold is open .",
    "the nn+nn  @xmath5  n+nnn cross section displays the usual @xmath250 law of the inelastic process and the crossed channel n+nnn  @xmath5  nn+nn the expected @xmath251 law .",
    "the elastic d+d cross section has been calculated neglecting coulomb interactions which will make this quantity divergent . however , due to the absence of nearthreshold singularity , one can expect small corrections to the low energy parameters obtained in this way , like in the n+n versus p+p case .    of particular interest",
    "is the extraction of the imaginary part of the strong d+d scattering length , a quantity which controls the fusion rate in the process d+d",
    "@xmath5  n+@xmath1he .",
    "this can be done either from the linear behavior of the d+d phase - shifts @xmath252 ( with @xmath253 ) , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ ddd1 ] , or from the inelasticity in the non diagonal s - matrix element which behaves like @xmath254 .",
    "both methods agree with high accuracy and lead to the following values : @xmath255 we remark a very small value of @xmath256 that should be only slightly modified once the coulomb interaction is switched on .",
    "this small value is due to the small overlapping between the k and h configurations which respectively govern the n+nnn and nn+nn asymptotic states .",
    "we have presented the first solution of faddeev - yakubovsky equations in configuration space for the scattering states in the 4n system .",
    "they concern both the n+nnn elastic scattering and its coupling to the first inelastic nn+nn channel .",
    "the n+nnn elastic phase - shifts have been calculated for the different spin and isospin channels .",
    "the low energy parameters have been extracted and the validity of the effective range approximation in the energy region below the 3-body break - up threshold has been analyzed .",
    "we have in particular found the importance of including the pole contribution in the @xmath214 case due to the vicinity of the first @xmath186 excitation .",
    "we have also found that in the framework of our model this @xmath2 state is bound at 0.25  mev below the 3n threshold .",
    "the study of the two - body correlation functions showed that the structure of this state is a 1 + 3 configuration rather than a breathing mode , as it is usually accepted .",
    "the coherence between the binding energy of this state and the scattering results has been emphasized .",
    "the n+t scattering cross section has been treated with a special interest and the first negative parity states have been included , to account for the structure experimentally observed .",
    "the elastic cross section is well described by the simple mt  i - iii interaction , especially in the resonance region .",
    "the n+t p - waves resonance is thus reproduced by a nn pure s - wave interaction .",
    "this shows the difficulty to understand this structure in terms of the nn interaction alone .",
    "it is created by the direct and exchange mechanism between the incoming neutron and the target nucleons .",
    "the s - matrix coupling the n+nnn and nn+nn channels has been obtained as well as the corresponding cross sections .",
