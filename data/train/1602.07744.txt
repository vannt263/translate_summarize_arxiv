    "one of the most interesting goals in cosmology nowadays is the detection of the primordial curl component ( `` b - mode '' ) of the _ cosmic microwave background _ ( cmb ) polarization at large angular scales .",
    "this tiny signal might provide the indirect confirmation of the inflationary paradigm since a background of primordial gravitational waves would leave such a characteristic imprint on the cmb .",
    "_ transition edge sensors _ ( tes ) are the state of the art technology in cmb measurements .",
    "thanks to their high sensitivity they are the choice of cutting - edge experiments both from ground and stratosphere .",
    "the readout strategies are mature enough to manage thousands of detectors .",
    "a step forward for applications which favor light collection efficiency per detector over spatial resolution , is represented by the use of multi - moded detectors we have modeled and simulated feedhorns and cavities for such purpose as shown in @xcite .",
    "this allows to significantly increase the sensitivity as for a given number @xmath0 of efficiently coupled radiation modes at a given frequency , the photon noise limited @xmath1 ratio improves as @xmath2 , at the cost of coarser angular resolution .",
    "this is an appealing solution for the lspe - swipe instrument , designed to perform a balloon - borne measurement of cmb polarization at large angular scales @xcite .",
    "lspe will observe @xmath3 of the sky in a circumpolar flight during the arctic night @xmath4 .",
    "the swipe instrument consists of two focal planes populated with 330 multimoded tes bolometers @xcite , equally split in the 3 bands @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ghz , and looking at the sky through a polarizer and cold rotating half wave plate ( hwp ) .",
    "this work is motivated by the necessity of optimizing the tes chip under an operating background larger than the one present in standard single - mode detectors operating in the same frequency bands .",
    "this requires a fine - tuning and trade - off of the characteristics of the tes taking into account their noise and saturation power . in this contribution",
    "we present the design of the lspe - swipe detectors in terms of heat capacities @xmath8 and thermal conductivities @xmath9 for the chip constituents , and relate them to the bolometer time constant @xmath10 .",
    "finally we discuss the results of the optimization for the specific case of lspe - swipe , for each band of the instrument , constraining the detector parameters as well as the transition temperature of the film @xmath11 and its normal resistance @xmath12 .",
    "we show that , with these choices , we are able to push the tes technology to its best performance @xcite .",
    "lspe scans the sky by spinning in azimuth , at a rate @xmath13 , so that the telescope , pointed at elevation @xmath14 , scans the sky at speed @xmath15 . if the beam has a gaussian shape with standard deviation @xmath16 , and the time response of the detector is described by a first - order low - pass with time constant @xmath10 , the degradation of the beam response depends only on the ratio @xmath17 between the time required to cross one beamwidth and the time constant : @xmath18 it has been demonstrated that for @xmath19 the deformation of the beam is negligible for accurate determination of cmb anisotropy and the related cosmological parameters @xcite . in the case of",
    "lspe - swipe @xmath20 rpm , the beam fwhm is @xmath21 and the minimum elevation is @xmath22 : the condition @xmath19 results in a requirement for the time constant of the detectors @xmath23 ms .",
    "this can be met for our large throughput bolometers , exploiting the extreme electrothermal feedback conditions achievable with tes sensors .",
    "our choice is to consider a time constant : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , that accounts for the chip geometry and the used materials , is the heat capacity of the bolometer , @xmath9 is the thermal dynamic conductance of the link between the sensor and the thermal bath and @xmath26 is the loop gain that will be evaluated in what follows . with an assumed transition width @xmath27 , a bath temperature @xmath28 , a critical temperature @xmath29 @xcite and an @xmath30 , for @xmath31",
    ", we obtain : transition slope @xmath32 , loop gain @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the constraint on the time constant is also dictated by the choice of the readout scheme .",
    "the stability of the resonator , when it is ac biased , in a frequency domain multiplexing environment could be damaged by a small detector time constant @xcite .",
    "reverting eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) , this converts into a requirement on the value of @xmath9 necessary to meet the time constant target such that : @xmath35 .",
    "in order not have an increase in the noise equivalent power ( nep ) larger than @xmath36 of photon noise , we aim at a thermal nep a factor @xmath37 smaller than photon nep .",
    "photon noises in the three swipe bands are : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "photon noise has been computed adding in quadrature the contributions from the cmb , galactic dust at high latitudes , residual atmosphere , cryostat window , optical filters at different temperature stages inside the cryostat .",
    "each contribution has been modeled as a gray - body , with the appropriate emissivity term multiplied by the efficiency of the instrument ( filters transmission times bolometer absorption efficiency ) . for each noise contribution , the poisson and wave - interference photon noise terms have been added in quadrature . the noise contribution from different radiation modes",
    "has been assumed to be uncorrelated . under these assumptions",
    "the contribution to the nep due to photon noise from each source can be computed as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the instrument efficiency while @xmath43 is the emissivity of the source .",
    "this expression could be derived following @xcite .",
    "the thermal noise , is defined as : @xmath44 with @xmath45 that ranges @xmath46 and takes into account non - equilibrium effects @xcite , @xmath47 the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 the critical temperature and @xmath9 the conductance . to meet the desired requirements , in each band , we need to have a @xmath49 : @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for a given @xmath48 , just as we aim to have a @xmath53 , by reverting eq .",
    "( [ nepth ] ) we obtain the desired @xmath54 . in this estimate",
    "we are not aware of the thermal fluctuation noise because of the geometry of the chip @xcite : the thermistor is at the center of a _ spider - web _ absorber with a radial symmetry , as shown in @xcite .",
    "in order not have our tes saturated during observations due the the intrinsic background fluctuations , we set the saturation power requirements @xmath55 times the power loading expected on the detectors . after accounting for available bandpass information , we calculated the power loading on the detectors as @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58pw respectively for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ghz channels .",
    "the power load is evaluated by taking into account the emission of the optics , the bandwidth of the filters ( @xmath59 ) , the atmospheric signal and the throughput .",
    "the @xmath59 in each channel is : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "those latter narrow bandpasses are chosen to best constraint the slope of the foregrounds spectrum , meeting at the same time the optical load on detector requirement . with our setup",
    "we couple @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 modes in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath66 bands respectively with an efficiency @xmath67 of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath69 . modeling the weak thermal link to the heat bath with a temperature dependent conductivity , defined by the law @xmath70 , with @xmath71 for @xmath31 , we write @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the thermal conductivity exponent @xcite . the heat flow from the bolometer to the bath",
    "can be written as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are relative to the particular bolometer and material configuration .",
    "since the saturation power is the power dissipated to the bath at the superconducting temperature we can write : @xmath77 where everything depends on the thermal conductance @xmath9 between the bolometer and the bath : @xmath78",
    "the fridge base temperature is expected to be around @xmath79 .",
    "the required @xmath48 , taking into account unavoidable temperature gradients and non - uniformities will be at the level of @xmath80 . from what described in the previous sections",
    ", we can set three different constraints on the bolometer conductivity @xmath9 as a function of the tes critical temperature @xmath48 , with a loop gain @xmath81 and a @xmath25 that accounts for the chip geometry and the materials :    xxx from eq .",
    "( [ nepth ] ) : @xmath82 & from eq .",
    "( [ psat ] ) : @xmath83 & from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) : @xmath84    each inequality defines the space parameters in which noise performance of the system are preserved ( [ gnep ] ) , the experiment base temperature and power on the detectors is taken into account ( [ gpsat ] ) as well as the detector s time constant , constrained by the scanning strategy ( [ gtau ] ) .",
    "the allowed parameters space for @xmath9 and @xmath48 is depicted as shaded regions in plots of fig .  [",
    "fig : plot_res ] and the optimal values for the parameters are reported in table [ tab : results ] . for @xmath85 ,",
    "@xmath10 the allowed regions are on the upper side of the curves @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively . for the @xmath88",
    "the allowed region is the lower side of the @xmath89 curve . from fig.[fig : plot_res ] is evident that the acceptable size of the parameter space is small .",
    "this means that the tes bolometers construction parameters need to be fine - tuned to the incident power load with even more care as for single mode tes . just as we adopt multimode optics to collect the radiation , the incident power is higher than single mode ones . in the specific case of the multi - moded detectors of lspe ,",
    "we have demonstrated with this study that it is indeed possible to find a solution optimizing tes detectors performance , but this requires exquisite control of fabrication parameters and a very careful model of the power load on the detectors in all the phases of detector use .",
