    "jets are relatively common in extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , bridle & perley 1984 ) , and undoubtedly represent a trace of the energy transport from the nucleus to the outer hot spots / radio lobes .",
    "hence the interest of observations of jets at shorter wavelengths which can probe the sites of high energy particle acceleration and help determine their physical parameters .",
    "about a dozen jets have been detected so far with and ground - based telescopes ( sparks , biretta , & macchetto 1994 ) .",
    "x - ray counterparts , however , were detected so far in only a handful of cases , including m87 , 3c  273 , and cen  a ( feigelson et al .",
    "1981 ; harris & stern 1987 ; biretta et al . 1991 ) .",
    "this situation is rapidly changing now that the  x - ray observatory has enabled the discovery of new x - ray jets ( e.g. , chartas et al . 2000 ; wilson , young , & shopbell 2001 ) , thanks to its excellent sensitivity in the 0.210 kev range and superb angular resolution ( 0.5/pixel ) . here",
    "we report the detection with  of the x - ray counterpart of the radio - optical jet in the nearby radio source 3c  371 ( @xmath0=0.051 ) , which suggests that x - ray emission is indeed a common property of such jets .",
    "3c  371 is classified as an intermediate source between bl lacertae objects and radio galaxies ( miller 1975 ) .",
    "its radio morphology is characterized by two giant lobes and a 25-long , one - sided jet ( wrobel & lind 1990 ) , typical of frii galaxies .",
    "the jet - to - counterjet ratio from the radio is high , 1700:1 , implying a viewing angle @xmath1 18@xmath2 and lorentz factor @xmath3 3.2 ( gomez & marscher 2000 ) .",
    "however the lobe separation and intermediate classification suggest that 3c  371 is most likely seen at moderate viewing angles , near the upper limit quoted above .",
    "the radio jet is well studied at milli - arcsecond resolution ( gomez & marscher 2000 and references therein ) and shows no superluminal motion , with an upper limit of @xmath4 . optical emission from the jet was detected in ground - based ( nilsson et al .",
    "1997 ) and in  observations ( scarpa et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the optical jet is 5long , with at least three knots from the nucleus ; at 1.7  ( knot b , as in scarpa et al .",
    "1999 ) , 3.1  ( knot a , the brightest ) , and 4.5  ( knot d , the faintest ) .",
    "overall , the optical morphology tracks the radio one closely in the region of overlap ( scarpa et al .",

    "we present the  observations , together with unpublished archival 1.4 ghz data and a re - extraction of the fluxes from the  f555w image ( scarpa et al 1999 ) . throughout this work",
    "we adopt h@xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 , so at the distance of 3c  371 1=0.9  kpc . preliminary analysis of the  observation of 3c  371 was presented by sambruna et al .",

    "observed 3c  371 on 21 march 2000 .",
    "the source was at the nominal aimpoint of the acis - s3 chip and the exposure was continuous for @xmath8 10 ks .",
    "we used data reprocessed by the  x - ray center using up - to - date calibration files and standard screening procedures which left a net exposure of 10,120 s on - source . as we were originally interested in the large - scale x - ray environment of the source , no precaution",
    "was taken to mitigate pileup of the central core using a subarray mode .",
    "thus , the bright central core is severely piled - up , preventing us from performing any meaningful spectral and detailed spatial analysis of the nucleus .",
    "an image was produced by smoothing the raw  image with a gaussian of width=0.3  in the energy range 0.48 kev , where the background is negligible , with final resolution of 0.86  fwhm .",
    "an elongation of the emission in the s - w direction shows up clearly both in the raw and smoothed images .",
    "while we can not exclude some contamination from the psf wings in the innermost ( 2 ) parts of the jet , we note that the x - ray jet extends up to @xmath8 4 .",
    "more importantly , the x - ray elongation lies at the same position angle as the known radio - optical jet in 3c  371 ( figure 1 ) , which is convincing evidence of its reality .",
    "we also present a new  image of 3c  371 , calibrated from unpublished archival data obtained on 1 - 2 april 1998 as an hi absorption experiment ( p.i .",

    "the target was observed continuously for 18 hours , interleaved with 80-second scans of the nearby phase calibrator 1823 + 689 every ten minutes .",
    "some editing and the initial data calibration were performed at jodrell bank which yielded a single continuum data set at a center frequency of 1.353 ghz with 7.5 mhz total bandwidth .",

    "gain solutions were then applied to 3c  371 using a point source model for 1823 + 689 .",
    "the data were edited and self - calibrated using the caltech ` difmap ` package ( shepherd et al . 1994 ) .",
    "appropriate weights were applied to each antenna in order to account for their differing sensitivities .",
    "we reached a dynamic range ( peak to off - source rms ) of about 6000:1 in the final image ( figure 1 ) which is not shown at full resolution in order to compare directly with the  image .",
    "previous 1.7 ghz merlin maps shown at full resolution ( browne & orr 1981 ; akujor et al .",

    "( 1999 ) to which we refer the reader for details on the calibration .",
    "the f555w filter closely matches the standard johnson v - band .",
    "here , we re - extracted fluxes for knots a and b using apertures of radius 0.75  centered on the knot positions , for consistency with the  extraction .",
    "figure 1 shows the 0.48 kev acis image of 3c  371 ( top ) .",
    "also shown for comparison on the same scale are the images of the jet in the optical ( middle ) and radio ( bottom ) , from our  and data .",
    "the x - ray jet is clearly apparent in the s - w direction , with the same position angle on the sky as the optical and radio jets .",
    "a bright x - ray structure is visible at @xmath8 1.7  from the core , after which the x - ray suface brightness decreases with fainter x - ray emission present up to @xmath8 4 .",
    "a total of 360 counts are collected from the x - ray jet in 0.48 kev , of which @xmath8 260 are in the first feature . due to the limited statistics , it is difficult to determine whether the first bright `` knot '' is resolved or not .    comparing the multiwavelength morphologies of the jet",
    ", the brighter structure in the x - ray jet appears to coincide with optical knot b ( following the nomenclature of scarpa et al . 1999 ) . at this position both",
    "the radio and optical jets show relatively fainter emission spots .",
    "if the x - ray feature is real , this indicates a large difference of the x - ray morphology with respect to the optical and radio one .",
    "our optimally designed  go3 observations will better define the jet x - ray morphology close to the nucleus .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum of knot b using a circular region of radius 0.75 . to correct for contamination due to the core psf",
    ", we extracted spectra from a region with the same radius and at the same distance from the core ( 1.8 ) , but at different azimuth positions , to check for any systematic effects .",
    "we then subtracted these spectra from the x - ray spectrum of knot b , and performed spectral fits on the subtracted data .",
    "we find that the spectral fit results do not depend on the azimuth position .",
    "after subtraction , the spectrum of knot b contains 229 counts in 0.28 kev , and is consistent with a power law , absorbed by galactic n@xmath10 only ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the column density was fixed to galactic during the fits .",
    "the fitted photon index is @xmath12 in the range ( 1.5 , 2.1 ) at 90% confidence level .",
    "the 210 kev flux is f@xmath13 .",
    "the fit is good , with @xmath14=6 for 9 degrees of freedom .    for the remaining ,",
    "fainter part of x - ray jet , we measure @xmath8 100 counts . assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath15 and galactic n@xmath10 , the 210 kev flux is @xmath16 .",
    "this region coincides with knot a in the optical and radio images ( scarpa et al .",
    "using a short ( 10 ks )  image we have detected the x - ray counterpart of the radio - optical jet in the nearby radio galaxy 3c  371 .",
    "comparison with the optical and radio morphology from a reanalysis of archival  and  data shows that the peak x - ray emission from the jet does not coincide with the brightest knot at longer wavelengths .",
    "future deeper  images are needed to confirm this result .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from radio to x - rays of knots b and a. for the  image , we summed the clean components within the specified apertures within the ( u , v ) plane rather than the image plane . in both knots , the fluxes",
    "at all three wavelengths were extracted in the same circular region with radius 0.75 .",
    "figure 2 shows that in both cases the x - ray flux is below the extrapolation from the radio - to - optical continuum .",
    "the latter is slightly steeper for knot a than for knot b.    while the radio to optical continuum is due to synchrotron radiation , the radiative mechanisms usually considered as the possible origin of x - rays are either synchrotron or inverse compton ( ic ) scattering on various possible sources of soft photons ( celotti , ghisellini , & chiaberge 2001 ) .",
    "an analysis similar to pks 0637752 ( tavecchio et al . 2000 ) indicates that ic emission either on the internal synchrotron photons ( ssc ) or on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons can not explain the sed of knot b , unless the source is characterized by an extremely high doppler factor ( @xmath17 ) or is very far from equipartition ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the most natural interpretation of the seds is that the x - rays are due to synchrotron emission from the same population of relativistic electrons responsible for the longer wavelengths . in this scenario",
    "the steepening of the optical - to - x - ray continuum between knots b and a can be attributed to synchrotron radiative losses . a steep x - ray spectrum is predicted by this scenario ( @xmath18 ) for knot b , consistent with the fitted value of the photonx index within the 90% uncertainties ( see above ) .    applying a synchrotron homogeneous model , and assuming equipartition , we derive a magnetic field of few @xmath19 g and a doppler factor of a few ( for a knot radius of @xmath20 cm , or 1 ) , consistent with the jet - to - counterjet ratio from the radio (   1 ) .",
    "the derived electron lifetimes at 1 kev ( electrons with lorentz factor @xmath21 ) are short enough ( @xmath22 s ) for the electrons to effectively cool in the knot ( fig .",
    "the different x - ray morphology could be related , in this picture , to the short cooling time of x - ray emitting electrons .",
    "electrons producing x - rays cool rapidly after knot b , while optical and radio electrons can survive until they reach the bright knot a at @xmath23 , where emission can be enhanced by compression , by a larger magnetic field and/or by repeated acceleration with lower maximum energy .",
    "it is instructive to compare 3c  371 with two other well studied sources with x - ray jets , namely pks 0637752 and 3c  273 . in the former , the radio , optical and x - ray morphologies are quite similar ( chartas et al . 2000 ; schwartz et al .",
    "2000 ) and it is possible to explain quite well the x - ray emission as due to ic / cmb scattering off the jet electrons ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ) . for 3c  273",
    "the situation is more complex , with the global radio and x - ray morphology being anticorrelated along the jet ( sambruna et al .",
    "we proposed that the dominant x - ray emission mechanism is ic from cmb , although the evidence is not conclusive ( see marshall et al .",
    "2001 for a different interpretation ) .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that 3c  371 and pks 0637752 represent the prototypes of `` pure '' synchrotron and ic / cmb sources , respectively , while 3c  273 is an intermediate case , where both processes contribute to the total x - ray flux .",
    "clearly , a larger sample of sources with different morphologies and seds is necessary to discuss the importance of the two mechanisms in different sources , which we anticipate from our ongoing /  go2 survey of radio jets .    in conclusion ,",
    "a new x - ray jet has been detected in 3c  371 in a short  exposure . despite the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the x - ray data ,",
    "an intriguing morphology is apparent , with most of the x - ray counts coming from a region of relative minimum radio and optical emission .",
    "the broad - band sed at two different locations in the jet are consistent with a synchrotron origin for the x - rays .",
    "deeper  and  observations of 3c  371 are planned , which will allow us to confirm the x - ray morphology of the jet and measure accurately its spectrum as a function of position along the jet .",
