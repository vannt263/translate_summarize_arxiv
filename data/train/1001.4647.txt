    "the longest controversial issue in the scientific history is perhaps over the fundamental question of nature that whether light is wave or particle ?",

    "moreover he also suggested that a moving electron too can exhibit wave properties and it was experimentally proved to be so .",
    "however , the wave - particle dilemma especially for light still persists @xcite in some ways .",
    "it is not cleat as to why electromagnetic radiation behaves as particle in one experiment and as wavy in another experiment .",
    "both the particle and wave aspects have never been observed simultaneously , as if one aspect comes into being only if the other aspect is absent and vice - versa .",

    "the novel concept of ` complex mass ' is presented , and its applicability to several situations are demonstrated in this paper .",
    "many arguments could be given in favour of the need for the new concept of mass .",
    "however , the author would state / quote a few , as follows : +   + ( i ) mass and energy are no more separate quantities , but are interwoven by einstein s mass - energy equation .",
    "this may imply that mass losses its independent identity and requires a new interpretation .",
    "+   + ( ii ) it is known , as ugarov @xcite mentions in his book on special relativity that ` rest mass of a system exceeds the sum of rest masses of constituent particles by a certain amount estimated in the reference frame in which the total momentum is zero ' .",
    "he states further that ` rest mass is not additive quantity ' .",
    "such a property of mass is uncommon in classical mechanics .",

    "the quaternion was first proposed by hamilton @xcite as a sum of scalar plus vector [ 8 - 10 ] ; is mass ` a quaternion ' for a moving body ?",
    "yes , it seems to be so @xcite . alternatively ; the representation of a moving mass as ` a complex - quantity ' is more meaningful for its familiarity and ease of writing & comprehension , and that is what is done in the present paper as a better way than the earlier paper @xcite .",

    "this may tentatively be considered as a postulate for the time being .",
