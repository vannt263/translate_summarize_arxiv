    "when @xmath48 , the system is reduced to the strictly hyperbolic system , @xmath49 the entropy solution to the riemann problem was first constructed by lax @xcite . in particular , the solution is self - similar and consists of constant states separated by elementary waves : rarefaction waves , shocks , and contact discontinuities .",
    "furthermore , the global existence of weak solutions to the cauchy problem was established by glimm @xcite , who considered lax s solutions as the build blocks of the scheme .",
    "for the inhomogeneous hyperbolic systems , @xmath50 the cauchy problem was first studied by liu @xcite . for the cauchy problem of the general quasi - linear , strictly hyperbolic system @xmath51",
    "the existence of entropy solutions was first established by dafermos and hsiao @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "system was studied under dissipative conditions by using the asymptotic expansion of the classical riemann solutions .",
    "the aforementioned conditions contribute considerably in investigating the systems and . in the aforementioned studies ,",
    "the source term was used for generating an extra stationary characteristic field in the riemann problem .",
    "the time - independent wave curves generated by this filed are tangential to the classical 1-wave curves at sonic states , resulting in the nonuniqueness of solutions of a riemann problem .",
    "the total variations of solutions may blow up in a finite time and the blow up phenomenon can be eliminated using a further dissipative assumption .",
    "when @xmath52 and @xmath53 are independent of @xmath6 , bianchini - bressan @xcite studied the existence result by using regularization method .",
    "luskin - temple @xcite and the authors in @xcite establish the existence result by combining glimm s scheme with the method of fractional steps .",
    "base on these studies , we can consider the effect of the source in as the perturbations of the solutions to the homogeneous conservation laws .",
    "the appearance of the source terms in breaks up the self - similarity of riemann waves .",

    "this construction of the generalized riemann solver is in contrast to the fractional step scheme @xcite and other operator splitting methods @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the effect of the source on the solutions of the classical riemann problem is decoupled . in our case , the effect of the source on the solutions of the classical riemann problem is strongly coupled .",
    "the estimates of wave interaction are more complicated than in @xcite .    for the stability of the generalized glimm scheme , contrary to the methods used in @xcite ,",
    "in which the positivity of the gas velocity is assumed , we can demonstrate , through the structure of the generalized glimm s approximate solution , that the escape velocity of the gas is globally positive , which matches the astronomical observation .",
    "therefore , the uniform bounds of the total variations of the approximate solutions in can be achieved by showing that ( 1 ) the glimm functionals of @xmath58 are nonincreasing in time and ( 2 ) the perturbations have a uniform bound of the total variations in each time step .",
    "in addition , we prove positivity of the gas velocity through a rigorous mathematical proof . based on the contraction matrix @xmath64 , we can achieve a more accurate formula of wave interaction estimates that lead to the decay result of the glimm functionals , and a new relation between the velocity and the glimm functionals in each time step .",
    "consequently , the stability of the generalized glimm scheme and the global positivity of the gas velocity is obtained , as shown in section 3 .",
