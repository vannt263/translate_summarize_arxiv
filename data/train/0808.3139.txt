    "there has recently been a large advance in our ability to undertake deep , large - area surveys in the near - infrared ( ir ) due to the introduction of very large ir - sensitive arrays .",
    "such surveys allow us to collect statistically powerful samples of galaxies selected in the @xmath1 filter at 2.2@xmath0 m , providing access to the part of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) dominated by rest - frame optical light for galaxies at high redshift and by low - mass stars for galaxies at low redshift .",
    "since it is not as strongly affected by dust or biased towards young stars as optical emission , it provides a sample selected approximately on stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are several classifications for @xmath1-selected galaxies  extremely red objects ( eros  elston , rieke & rieke 1989 ) , distant red galaxies ( drgs  van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 ) and , more recently , bzk galaxies ( daddi et al .",
    "all these selections are colour based and aim to select  via sed shape  particular kinds of galaxies at particular redshifts .",
    "the most successful selection appears to be via the bzk technique , where both passive ( pbzk ) and star - forming ( sbzk ) galaxies can be selected over the interval @xmath3 . in order to investigate the star - formation properties of these galaxies",
    ", we will exploit deep radio imaging and stack the ir positions into the radio data to derive averaged radio properties at @xmath0jy levels for various classes of @xmath1-selected sources .    the strong correlation between far - ir ( fir ) and radio emission ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ) in local star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) has allowed the use of radio surveys as a means to quantify star - formation activity in a manner immune to the obscuring effects of dust .",
    "the fir emission is believed to be produced by dust which has been heated by the ultraviolet ( uv ) photons from massive stars .",
    "these stars end their lives as supernovae and the remnants of these explosions produce the synchrotron radio emission . thus both",
    "the fir and radio trace the rate of formation of massive stars .",
    "radio emission is unaffected by dust , unlike optical and uv photons , and so the radio provides a powerful tool for studying star formation at high angular resolution in a relatively unbiased way .",
    "the radio source counts above 1mjy are dominated by agn , the powerful fanaroff - riley - ii ( frii  fanaroff & riley 1974 ) sources giving way to the less powerful ( but still radio - loud ) fri agn as the flux - density threshold approaches @xmath7mjy ( windhorst et al .",
    "1985 ; willott et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the evolution of these two types of radio - emitting agn differs , with frii sources undergoing strong evolution ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ; willott et al .",
    "2001 ) while fri sources undergo a weaker evolution or possibly maintain a constant co - moving space density ( clewley & jarvis 2004 ; sadler et al .  2007 ; rigby , best & snellen 2008 ) . the contribution of these sources to the radio source counts should continue to be a power law to fainter flux densities ( jarvis & rawlings 2004 ) . at flux densities below 1mjy ,",
    "the radio counts are observed to flatten and a new population of sub - mjy radio sources , originally thought to be sfgs , becomes apparent ( condon 1984 ) .",
    "there is the possibility , however , that the sub - mjy population could also consist of ` radio - quiet ' agn ( jarvis & rawlings 2004 )  i.e.  agn with a low ratio of radio to optical / x - ray luminosity which still contain a super - massive black hole accreting at a high rate , contributing to the radio emission .    the exact mix of agn versus star formation at sub - mjy levels is still the subject of lively debate ( see ibar et al .  2008 and references therein ) .",
    "the first deep radio surveys ascribed the bulk of the sub - mjy activity to sfgs ( hopkins et al .",
    "1998 ; gruppioni et al.1999 ; richards 2000 ) though further investigations with more complete optical , x - ray and high - resolution radio imaging have shown a very mixed picture . a deep , narrow 5-ghz survey in the lockman hole ( ciliegi et al .  2003 ) found a flattening of radio spectral indices at faint flux limits , consistent with an increasing fraction of agn .",
    "they also found that a substantial fraction ( 50 per cent ) of @xmath8-@xmath0jy sources are early - type galaxies . using radio morphologies to distinguish radio agn from sfgs suggests a mix of both types at faint flux levels across a broad range of redshift and radio luminosity ( richards et al .",
    "2007 ) , although approaching this with sufficient resolution awaits the commissioning of e - merlin .",
    "simpson et al .  ( 2006 ) studied the the nature of the sub - mjy population ( @xmath9jy ) in the subaru-_xmm - newton _ deep field ( sxdf ) and concluded that radio - quiet agn make a significant contribution to the counts at @xmath10jy .",
    "this conclusion is supported by smoli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the cosmos field , where they find that 5060 per cent of @xmath11 galaxies with @xmath12jy are agn .",
    "in contrast , a recent study by seymour et al .  ( 2008 ) , using vla and merlin images , has been able to separate radio sources into agn and sfgs on the basis of radio morphology , spectral index and radio / near - ir and mid - ir / radio flux density ratios .",
    "they find that sfgs dominate the counts at @xmath1350@xmath0jy and account for the majority of the upturn in the radio counts below 1mjy .",
    "an extrapolation of their figure  3 to the flux densities we are typically probing here ( @xmath14jy ) would suggest that agn are far outnumbered by sfgs and should not be a major concern in this stacking .",
    "as we are probing the radio population at flux density levels an order of magnitude fainter than existing studies , it is impossible to know  _ a priori _  the relative contributions to the radio flux of accretion and star formation for a given population .",
    "this difficulty in distinguishing between star - formation- and agn - induced radio emission will potentially present us with biases in our results .",
    "for instance , if we assume all of the radio emission is due to star formation , then we will over - estimate the true sfrs . if , in the hope of excising agn , we discount all sources with certain values of @xmath15 or ratios of radio / optical flux , then we will bias ourselves as extreme starbursts will also have high @xmath15 ( ivison et al .",
    "2002 ) and high radio / optical ratios . given the findings of richards et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , that radio - emitting agn appear at all radio luminosities and radio / optical ratios , we do not feel that such cuts to the sample can be justified .",
    "we will simply include all sources , placing an upper limit on the star - formation activity , investigating along the way whether there are any other indications as to the nature of the radio emission .",

    "4 we present the results of the stacks while in  5 we investigate the possible contamination from agn using radio spectral indices and submm stacks . in ",
    "6 we present the radio - derived sfh of @xmath1-selected galaxies out to @xmath16 and also investigate their specific sfrs as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "the cosmology used throughout is @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 .",
    "the catalogue used in this paper was selected from the ongoing uds , which is the deepest of the five surveys that comprise ukidss ( lawrence et al .",

    "briefly , we employed the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) vla at 1,400mhz , with an effective bandwidth of 4@xmath397@xmath393.125mhz ( via correlator mode ` 4 ' ) and central frequencies in the two if pairs of 1,365 and 1,435mhz .",
    "this provided a good compromise between high sensitivity ( via greater bandwidth ) and the effect of bandwidth smearing ( bws ) , which scales with channel width and distance from the pointing centre .",

    "generally these span the space overlapping pbzk , sbzk and non - bzk at the top right of the bzk diagram ( see fig .  [ erobzk ] ) .",
    "note that a sparse stellar branch is visible on the plot because the bzk diagram is efficient at selecting stars up to 1mag deeper than the compactness selection used to make the @xmath1 catalogue .",
    "these colour selections are untested at the depths of the uds and we will investigate their reliability as best we can using the radio data and photometric redshifts .",
    "we also note that the sbzk star - forming sample is known to contain a fraction of agn ( daddi et al .",
    "2004 ; reddy et al .  2005 ) and we will discuss this in more detail in  [ agn ] .          to perform the stacking we measured the noise - weighted mean and median of the pixels on the radio image corresponding to the positions of the @xmath1-band sources . as the radio image has units of jybeam@xmath20 , this pixel stacking gives the total flux of a source which is no larger than the beam .",
    "we only considered regions on the radio image with @xmath50jy .",
    "for the mean stacks we excluded pixels with @xmath51 but for the median we included all sources .",
    "the errors on the median were calculated using the distribution of flux densities , following gott et al .",
    "while there is often a small difference between the mean and median value , these are usually within the @xmath52 uncertainties in each case .",
    "the median ( gott et al .  2001 ) is a more robust measure of a population which may deviate from a normal distribution ( as a population containing detections will do ) and so , in general , we prefer the median .",
    "this is important in the samples which we later bin by stellar mass or absolute @xmath1 mag , since as many as 30 per cent of the sources may be detected at @xmath405@xmath23 in the highest bins of stellar mass . to discount these detections ( as done when computing the mean ) would not produce a representative average for this high - mass sub - sample ; with the median we can use the same statistic whatever the fraction of detections .",
    "we corrected the final mean or median values for the effect of bandwidth smearing ( as described in ",
    "[ radio - obs ] ) by multiplying the value by the mean or median bws term .",
    "the mean and median bws term was calculated in the same way as the mean and median flux density .",
    "the reason the correction was applied to the final stacked value rather than the individual pixel values is explained next .",
    "the bws correction should not affect the noise on the map ; it merely corrects for the reduction in peak flux density due to bws .",
    "however , in stacking ( where we expect no detections ) our stacked values can be positive or negative , thus the effect of a bws correction applied to each pixel would be to increase the effective @xmath52 on the resulting pixel flux distribution .",
    "if we multiply each pixel by the bws value , but not the noise on that pixel , then we are artificially increasing the s / n of every pixel .",
    "this has two consequences : first , we finish with statistics which are not gaussian ( e.g.  more @xmath403-@xmath23 peaks on the stacked maps than expected ) ; second , as we are rejecting @xmath53 points from the stack , we have fewer points to stack . if we decide to increase the noise at every point by the bws factor to counter these problems then , again , we have less sources to stack as a larger fraction of the map then appears to have @xmath54jy . our solution was to multiply both the final flux density in the stack _ and _ the final error by the averaged bws .",
    "this leaves us with the correct number of sources and gaussian statistics ( so the reliability of the detections is intuitive to calculate ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we now split the samples into bins of redshift and stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) , or absolute rest - frame @xmath1 mag .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath1 mags are calculated with the photometric redshifts using the best - fitting sed template .",
    "these are then converted into @xmath55 using the relationship given by the millennium simulation ( de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) in the manner employed by serjeant et al.(2008 ) which is effectively using a salpeter imf .",
    "this is a redshift - dependent conversion which agrees with observational data from the munich near - ir cluster survey ( munics  drory et al.2004 ) .",
    "there are , of course , uncertainties in moving between @xmath1 and @xmath6 ; the scatter in the relationship used here is of order 0.2 - 0.3 dex at a given redshift .",
    "a more careful measurement will be possible in the future using the results of the _ spitzer _ legacy survey of the uds , in particular the 3.68-@xmath0 m data .",
    "we have checked that using @xmath6 rather than the simpler absolute @xmath1 mag does not change the trends discussed in this section .",
    "we use @xmath6 as this is more directly comparable to other work in the literature .      to begin with ,",
    "we look at the sfrd as a function of redshift for our full sample ( i.e. ` all galaxies ' from section  [ irsel ] ) .",
    "the sample was divided into a number of redshift bins and the median sfr for each bin calculated .",
    "the volume contained within each bin was calculated using the effective survey area ( uds / suprimecam / vla overlap field , excluding regions around bright stars and with @xmath56jy ) which is 1311.1arcmin@xmath21 .",
    "the space density is the number of sources meeting the selection criteria in that redshift bin divided by the volume in the bin .",
    "the space density is corrected for the 80 percent completeness of the @xmath1-sample in the magnitude range @xmath57 by finding the number of galaxies within each redshift bin in this magnitude range , multiplying that number by 1.2 and adding it to the number of galaxies in that redshift bin at @xmath58 .",
    "these corrections are small and range from 1.04 at low redshift to 1.13 at @xmath59 .",
    "the sfrd is estimated by multiplying the space density by the median stacked sfr for each redshift bin .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sfrd ] for both methods of estimating the sfr .",
    "the errors on the points are the sum in quadrature of the error on the median sfr for a bin , the poisson @xmath60 contribution and cosmic variance errors , derived from fig .  2 in somerville et al.(2004 ) .",
    "plotted in grey are the points from the compilation of hopkins & beacom ( 2006 , hereafter hb06 ) .",
    "our radio - derived sfrs do not come from a flux - limited sample and thus can , in principle , span the full radio luminosity function ( lf ) at all redshifts",
    ". however , the @xmath1-selected sample we are stacking does lose lower @xmath1 luminosity sources at higher redshifts .",
    "if the radio - derived sfr and @xmath1-band luminosity are correlated then we will have an effective ` luminosity limit ' to our radio stacks , as a function of redshift , which will mean that we will be missing some fraction of the sfrd at higher redshifts .",

    "this is the highest redshift study of star formation in the radio to date and it is not clear why the shape of the radio sfrd should be different to that derived in the optical waveband .",
    "one possibility is that the radio breaks down as a tracer of sfr at high redshift .",
    "carilli & yun ( 1999 ) suggest that radio emission could be quenched at high redshift by inverse compton scattering from the microwave background , but it is believed that this should only be a serious effect at @xmath78 .",
    "so far , no evolution has been observed in the radio / fir correlation out to @xmath79 ( kovacs et al .",

    "the optical / uv points at @xmath81 are also subject to substantial correction for the effects of dust , which may not be appropriate at these redshifts .",

    "overall , at this point , we feel there is nothing to choose between the two sfr conversions and so will continue to use both in the following section .",
    "we can also look at the average sfr per unit stellar mass , defined as the ssfr , as a function of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "ssfr is often used as a measure of the star - formation efficiency of a galaxy , since it provides information about the fraction of a galaxy s mass which could be converted into stars in a given time .",

    ", @xmath1 is shifting into the rest - frame optical , making our selection more sfr - based than @xmath55-based . as predicted , this causes a stronger apparent trend of ssfr with @xmath6 because high - ssfr objects are preferentially selected near the limit of the survey .    in summary",
    ", many independent studies find similar trends , with ssfr increasing with redshift and decreasing with stellar mass .",
    "however , the strength of these relationships varies considerably and is likely to be due to a complicated combination of sample - selection criteria , particularly wavelength and depth .",
    "many authors make strong statements about downsizing , based on the evolution of ssfr with redshift in different stellar mass bins , and on the oft - strong correlation of ssfr with stellar mass .",
    "_ we would urge caution before over - interpreting this type of plot as it is influenced strongly by selection biases . _ given that our exploration of sfr versus absolute @xmath1 mag produced a linear correlation , with @xmath107 , it is the conversion of @xmath1 mag to stellar mass which introduces the slight non - linearity in sfr versus @xmath6 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this , in turn , produces the shallow observed dependence of ssfr on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the conversion to stellar mass can also introduce systematic effects , producing trends in ssfr with @xmath6 .",

    "if they truly do lie at low redshift , they represent a population of low - mass , highly star - forming galaxies , quite unlike the general low - redshift population .",
    "confirmation of their nature must await spectroscopy .",
    "the pbzk galaxies behave quite differently .",
    "their ssfr drops from @xmath117 to @xmath118 and then appears to be consistent again with the other samples at very high redshifts .",
    "we have already noted changes in pbzk properties at @xmath119 from their radio spectral indices (  [ gmrt ] ) , the decrease in their radio flux density and the suggestion of a similar decrease in their submm flux density .",
    "this argues that the bzk diagram alone is not discriminating effectively between passive and star - forming galaxies  accurate redshifts are also required .",
    "the persistent ( but lower level ) radio flux density at @xmath4 could be due either to low - level sfg contamination or to radio - quiet agn activity . the radio spectral indices and submm stacking also suggest a change in the dominant pbzk population at @xmath120 , but our submm and 610-mhz observations are not deep enough to allow us to conclude which of the above scenarios is responsible for the low - level 1,400-mhz emission at @xmath4 .",
    "future analysis of the larger shades 1.1-mm aztec image , newly acquired _ spitzer _ data , alongside the zuds spectroscopic programme , should determine the true nature of pbzk galaxies .",
    "we have stacked several @xmath1-selected populations into a deep 1,400-mhz mosaic in order to investigate their star - formation history .",
    "there is much dispute over the relative contribution from star formation and agn to the radio populations at sub - mjy levels and our knowledge is almost non - existent at flux levels below those where individual galaxies are usually detected ( @xmath28100@xmath0jy ) .",
    "we certainly can not distinguish unambiguously between star - formation- and agn - related emission .",
    "however , their spectral indices , submm flux densities and the good agreement between sfrds derived in the radio and that determined at other wavelengths argues that radio - quiet agn do not make an important contribution to the average radio properties of our @xmath1-selected galaxies at these flux densities ( 520@xmath121jy ) .",
    "we find a strong relationship between stacked radio flux density and apparent @xmath1 mag .",
    "we also find sfr to be a strong and almost linear function of absolute @xmath1 mag and stellar mass .",
    "both sbzk and pbzk galaxies are detected robustly in the radio stack .",
    "the stacked radio flux density of the sbzk galaxies is roughly constant with redshift , inferring a strong evolution in sfr .",
    "our photometric redshifts suggest that a significant fraction ( @xmath133040 per cent ) of galaxies occupying the sbzk and pbzk regions of the bzk diagram lie at @xmath2 .",
    "the similarity between sbzk and @xmath2 pbzk galaxies  in terms of their radio- and submm - derived sfr and ssfr  leads us to suggest that the bzk diagram alone is not sufficient to select passive high - redshift galaxies . only pbzk galaxies at @xmath4 seem consistent with this designation , those at @xmath2 are likely to be star forming galaxies similar in nature to sbzk .",
    "the pbzk galaxies suffer a dramatic reduction in radio flux density at @xmath4 .",
    "their weak radio flux density at @xmath4 suggests either a persistent , low - level of contamination by sfgs , or that the radio emission for these objects is powered by radio - quiet agn .",
    "deeper 610-mhz and submm data are required to determine which is the case .",
    "the variation of radio - derived sfr density with redshift agrees well with that determined at other wavelengths , for @xmath122 .",
    "this suggests that the contribution from agn - related radio emission is small . at @xmath123 , the radio - derived sfr density declines due to our inability to fully sample the @xmath1-band luminosity function at these redshifts . after correcting for this , using the evolving @xmath1-band uds lfs",
    ", we still see a downturn in the radio - derived sfrd at high redshifts which is not apparent in the other multi - wavelength data .",
    "the reason for this is not clear but we suggest three possibilities : ( a ) a changing slope with redshift for the @xmath1-band lf , which would mean our lf corrections have been underestimated ; ( b ) dust corrections to the optical / uv data are too high ; ( c ) the radio emission is not tracing star formation efficiently at high redshift , possibly due to evolution of the magnetic field properties or a change in the mode of star formation .",
    "we find that the ssfr ( sfr/@xmath6 ) is only weakly dependent on stellar mass , with ssfr decreasing as @xmath6 increases .",
    "the observed correlation of ssfr with stellar mass is consistent with the shallower determinations in the literature , such as daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) at @xmath5 and elbaz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) at @xmath124 .",
    "it is much less steep than many optical-/uv - based studies and we argue that these differences are largely due to selection biases present in uv- and optically - selected samples . we also find a very strong trend of increasing ssfr with redshift , stronger than reported elsewhere , with a flattening at @xmath125 .",
    "this is also where the difference between high- and low - mass bins becomes greatest and where @xmath1 begins to sample the rest - frame optical waveband , meaning that sample selection becomes more influenced by star formation and less by stellar mass .    comparing the radio - derived sfr conversions from bell ( 2003 ) and condon ( 1992 ) ,",
    "the former provides a better match to the observed trends in ssfr versus stellar mass in the lowest mass bins , and also in reproducing the low - redshift sfrd seen in other wavebands .    in summary ,",
    "the uds has produced a statistically powerful sample of @xmath1-selected galaxies , including several thousand selected by colour to lie at high redshift .",
    "stacking these samples into a deep 1,400-mhz radio image has enabled us to determine their radio properties at flux densities an order of magnitude fainter than has previously been possible with flux - limited radio surveys .",
    "the pseudo - stellar - mass selection achieved in the @xmath1 band  combined with a probe of star formation which is not limited to the rarest , brightest sources  has allowed us to follow the sfrd out to @xmath126 and to investigate the evolution of ssfr in galaxies with redshift in a relatively unbiased way .",

    "<S> we have studied the @xmath0jy radio properties of @xmath1-selected galaxy populations detected in the ultra - deep survey ( uds ) portion of the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) deep sky survey ( ukidss ) using 610- and 1,400-mhz images from the very large array ( vla ) and the giant metre - wave telescope ( gmrt ) . </S>",
    "<S> these deep radio mosaics , combined with the largest and deepest @xmath1-band image currently available , allow high - signal - to - noise ( s / n ) detections of many @xmath1-selected sub - populations , including sbzk and pbzk star - forming and passive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong correlation between the radio and @xmath1-band fluxes and a linear relationship between star - formation rate ( sfr ) and @xmath1-band luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence , from either radio spectral indices or a comparison with submm - derived sfrs , that the full sample is strongly contaminated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at these low flux densities , though this is very difficult to determine from this dataset . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric redshift distributions for the bzk galaxies place 37 ( 29 ) per cent of pbzk ( sbzk ) galaxies at @xmath2 , implying that location on the bzk diagram alone is not sufficient to select samples at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the sbzk and pbzk galaxies have similar levels of radio flux density , sfr and specific sfr ( ssfr  sfr per unit stellar mass ) at @xmath2 , suggesting there is strong contamination of the pbzk sample by star - forming galaxies . at @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the pbzk galaxies become difficult to detect in the radio stack , though the implied sfrs are still much higher than expected for passively evolving galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it may be that their radio emission comes from low - luminosity agn . </S>",
    "<S> extremely red objects ( eros ) straddle the passive and star - forming regions of the bzk diagram and also straddle the two groups in terms of their radio properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1-bright ero samples are dominated by passive galaxies and faint ero samples contain more star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the star - formation history ( sfh ) from stacking all @xmath1-band sources in the uds agrees well with that derived for other wavebands and other radio surveys , at least out to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio - derived sfh then appears to fall more steeply than that measured at other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the ssfr for @xmath1-selected sources rises strongly with redshift at all stellar masses , and shows a weak dependence on stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> high- and low - mass galaxies show a similar decline in ssfr since @xmath5 .    galaxies : active  galaxies : evolution  galaxies : starburst </S>"
