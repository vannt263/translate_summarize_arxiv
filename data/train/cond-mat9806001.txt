    "the classic work of kramers in 1940 @xcite on reaction rates in which the effect of the solvent was taken into account in the form of a markovian dissipation and gaussian delta - correlated fluctuations has spawned an enormous and important literature that continues to flourish @xcite .",
    "recent advances in experimental methods that make it possible to monitor the progress of chemical reactions on microscopic ( even single - molecule single - event ) spatial and temporal scales @xcite have led to a revival of interest in theoretical approaches that examine the problem on these detailed scales .    the enormous literature on the theoretical front since the appearance of kramers seminal paper has evolved in many directions that include more formal derivations of kramers own results , extensions to larger parameter regimes and to non - markovian dissipation models , generalizations to more complex potentials and to many degrees of freedom , analysis of quantum effects , and application to specific experimental systems .",
    "one such recent direction , developed by kohen and tannor ( kt ) @xcite , deals with the derivation of the rate coefficient in the kramers problem and in the more general grote - hynes problem @xcite ( that is , the kramers problem extended to a non - markovian dissipative memory kernel ) so as to obtain not only the asymptotic rate constant but the behavior of the rate coefficient at all times .",
    "this derivation is based on the reactive flux method @xcite and allows the interpretation of the salient features of the time dependent rate coefficient @xmath0 in terms of the time evolution of the representative distribution functions that originate at the top of the barrier , thus paralleling closely and usefully the methods used in numerical simulations of the problem .",
    "kt analyze in detail the dependence on the dissipative memory kernel of the time it takes the rate coefficient to reach its stationary ( equilibrium ) value .",
    "their extensive analysis , however , does not cover a number of parameter regimes , nor do they check their time - dependent results against numerical simulations .",
    "we undertake such studies to complement their work .",
    "thus , we extend the parameter regime of analysis and check some of their results as well as our new ones against numerical simulations .    in this paper we restrict ourselves to the markovian regime , that is , to the original kramers problem , deferring the analysis of the non - markovian case to a subsequent publication .",
    "the dynamical equation of interest to us is thus the generic reaction coordinate problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the time - dependent reaction coordinate , a dot denotes a time derivative , @xmath3 is the dissipation parameter , @xmath4 is the potential energy , and @xmath5 represents gaussian delta - correlated fluctuations that satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath6 @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 is the temperature .",
    "the potential @xmath4 is a double - well potential that is often ( and here as well ) taken to be of the form @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the minima of the potential occur at @xmath10 , the potential barrier has a maximum at @xmath11 , and the barrier height there is @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 can be used as the unit of energy , and henceforth we set it equal to unity .",
    "the barrier height is assumed to be large compared to the temperature ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) ; otherwise the notion of a barrier crossing process loses its meaning .",
    "= 3.2 in    the problem of interest is the rate coefficient @xmath0 for an ensemble of particles whose positions evolve as realizations of @xmath2 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 measures the mean rate of passage of the ensemble across @xmath11 from one well to the other .",
    "this crossing rate and , in particular , its asymptotic value @xmath15 , is associated with the rate constant of the process represented by the reaction coordinate .",
    "one usually focuses on the corrections to the rate obtained from transition state theory ( tst ) and therefore writes @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the rate obtained from transition state theory for activated crossing , which for our problem and in our units is @xcite @xmath18 the deviations from this rate constant are then contained in the transmission coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "the construction of @xmath19 is discussed in subsequent sections . in the remainder of this work",
    "we designate the stationary or asymptotic transmission coefficient @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "= 3.2 in    the input parameters of the problem are the dissipation ( @xmath3 ) and the temperature ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the behavior of the stationary - state transmission coefficient @xmath21 as a function of these parameters , particularly as a function of @xmath3 , was the subject of a great deal of work in the 80 s .",
    "it was already realized by kramers that the behavior of @xmath21 vs @xmath3 would exhibit a maximum ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) since at intermediate and high dissipation (  diffusion limited regime \" ) the rate constant decreases with increasing dissipation while at low dissipation (  energy - diffusion limited regime \" ) it increases with increasing dissipation .",
    "indeed , kramers found that at as @xmath23 , @xmath24 while as @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "these limits were obtained from separate arguments , however , which therefore gave no indication of where precisely the  turnover \" ( maximum ) might occur .",
    "subsequent work attempted to address this problem @xcite .",
    "the other parameter dependence , namely , on temperature , has also been the object of study .",
    "for example , it is understood that the high - dissipation @xmath21 is independent of temperature whereas @xmath21 does depend on temperature in the low - dissipation regime .",
    "this is clearly seen in the simulation results in fig .",
    "discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] will be resumed later .",
    "the analysis of kt has carried the problem further in that they actually dealt with the full time - dependent evolution of the transmission coefficient .",
    "they derived an expression for @xmath19 in terms of the time - dependent phase space density , assumed a particular form for this density , and studied how @xmath19 goes to its steady state value as the phase space density relaxes to equilibrium . in carrying out this program , however , they relied on approximations that are appropriate for the diffusion limited regime and therefore were able to calculate @xmath19 only in this regime .",
    "they did not check their time - dependent results against simulations , although they did confirm numerically that the ( temperature - independent ) steady state values for the transmission coefficient that they predict in this regime are satisfactory .",
    "they also did not deal with the energy - diffusion limited regime .",
    "thus , to complement the work of kt in the markovian regime we accomplish three goals in this paper :    1 .",
    "we carry out simulations of the time - dependent transmission coefficient to assess and confirm the validity of the kt formulation in the diffusion - limited regime .",
    "their results agree very well with simulations in this regime .",
    "we formulate the complementary theory for the time - dependent transmission coefficient in the energy - diffusion limited regime and compare our results with numerical simulations in this regime .",
    "our theory captures the complex oscillatory and stationary state behavior of @xmath19 in this regime very well .",
    "we calculate and check via our simulation results the temperature dependence of the asymptotic transmission coefficient in the energy - limited diffusion regime beyond the kramers result .",
    "in section  [ sec2 ] we briefly review the reactive flux formalism .",
    "section  [ simulations ] contains a short description of the numerical methods used in our simulations .",
    "the results of kt in the diffusion - limited regime are recalled and compared to our simulation results in section  [ difflim ] .",
    "the departure of the kt results from the simulations at low dissipation are illustrated in this section . in sections",
    "[ energylimorbits ] and [ energylimtranscoeff ] we present our theory for the time - dependent transmission coefficient @xmath19 and its asymptotic value in the energy - diffusion limited regime .",
    "the comparison of our results with those of numerical simulations is presented in section  [ compare ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "two decades ago saw the development of the reactive flux formalism for the rate constant over a barrier @xcite .",
    "this formalism was important because it made possible efficient numerical simulations of the rate constant without having to wait the inordinately long time that it takes a particle at the bottom of one well to climb up to the top of the barrier . in the reactive flux method",
    "the problem is formulated in terms of the particles of the thermal distribution that are sufficiently energetic to be above the barrier at the outset . in this way , it is not necessary to wait for low - energy particles ( the vast majority of all the particles ) to first acquire sufficiently high energies via thermal fluctuations .",
    "we follow the notation of kt .",

    "a very small time step is used , ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , as in ref .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the transmission coefficient @xmath19 follows the description of refs .",
    "we start the simulation with @xmath44 particles ( either 4000 or 1000 depending of the circumstances ) , all of them above the barrier at @xmath11 , half with a positive velocity distributed according to the boltzmann distribution in energy , which translates to the velocity distribution @xmath45 , and the other half with the same distribution but with negative velocities .",
    "the transmission coefficient is extracted from these sets of simulated data by calculating @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the particles that started with positive velocities and negative velocities respectively and at time @xmath49 are in or over the right hand well ( i.e. the particles for which @xmath50 ) .",

    "@xcite , whereas the exact transmission coefficient reaches a constant non - zero value that corresponds to the equilibrium transition rate for the problem , the transmission coefficient calculated using the reactive flux method flattens out but continues to decrease with time . if the temperature is low , this decrease is slow and the results appear flat on the sort of time scale shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath19 in this flat region is identified with @xmath21 .",
    "if the temperature is not so low , then the decaying tail is extrapolated back to its intersection with the vertical axis according to the relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the decay constant of the tail .",

    "numerical uncertainties are fairly large and difficult to avoid for small values of @xmath21 .",
    "equation  ( [ fpqp ] ) can not be solved exactly for the bistable potential , and therefore the distribution @xmath39 is the quantity in the calculation of the transmission coefficient that requires approximation .",
    "the quality of the result of course depends on the quality of the approximations .",

    "we have exhibited the results for two temperatures .",
    "the high dissipation side of the curve is independent of temperature , but the low dissipation transmission coefficient is inversely proportional to temperature . the short - dashed curve is the kramers / grote - hynes result ( and therefore also the result recovered by kt ) . clearly , it is excellent at high dissipation ( a well - known result ) , but does not capture the turnover and subsequent decrease in the transmission coefficient as one enters the energy - diffusion limited regime .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] exhibits a typical simulation result in the high dissipation regime ( @xmath56 ) ( monotonic somewhat jagged curve ) and also the associated kt prediction eq .  ( [ ktdifflim ] ) ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the agreement is seen to be very good over the full time - dependence of the transmission coefficient .",
    "the very small discrepancy in the asymptotic regime is also typical , with the theoretical results slightly above those of the simulation .",
    "this may in part be due to the issues surrounding eq .",
    "( [ discrepancy ] ) . in any case , this degree of agreement between the kt theory and the simulations is typical in the regime well beyond the turnover in fig .",
    "the theory fails , however , at low dissipation parameters . in fig .",

    "these are for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "although the two values of @xmath3 that we have chosen for this figure lead to similar values of the stationary transmission coefficient , the decay towards these values is clearly very different in the two cases .",
    "the simulation results ( continuous curve ) and the kt result ( dotted curve ) agree at early times , until the simulation results rather suddenly drop and settle in an oscillatory way to a completely different lower asymptotic value than the theoretical result @xcite .",
    "the kt result in fact asymptotes to the grote - hynes rate , which in this regime is not correct . in the next sections we obtain results that predict the correct oscillatory and asymptotic behavior of the transmission coefficient in the very low dissipation regime",
    "in this section and the next , we detail the approach complementary to that of kt to obtain analytic results for the time - dependent transmission coefficient in the energy - diffusion limited regime .",
    "our results are compared to numerical simulations in section  [ compare ] .    for our calculation",
    "it is convenient to write the transmission coefficient as ( cf .",

    "when dissipation is very slow , the particles that start above the barrier lose their energy very slowly as they orbit around at an almost constant energy during each orbit ( recrossing the barrier many times if they start with sufficiently high energy ) .",
    "one can calculate the approximate energy loss per orbit and thus keep track of how long it takes a particle of a given initial energy above the barrier to lose enough energy to be caught in one well or the other .",
    "there is of course a thermal distribution of such particles above the barrier , and the time that it takes the ensemble to lose enough energy to be caught in a well is correspondingly distributed .",

    "we concentrate on the first two of these ingredients . the third component , which then leads directly to the transmission coefficient , is considered in the next section .",

    "the answer of course depends on the energy  in particular , according to eq .",
    "( [ approxapproxe ] ) , it depends on the time that it takes that particle to complete its half orbit . let @xmath91 be the energy loss in a half orbit of a particle that has initial energy @xmath66 .",

    "indeed , particles that we take to be trapped forever can in reality recross the barrier due to thermal fluctuations ( but in very small numbers at low temperatures , as reflected in the small value of the equilibrium transmission coefficient ) .",
    "furthermore , the average energy loss per half orbit , @xmath94 , has been assumed independent of @xmath92 , but in reality @xmath98 increases with @xmath92 , even in the  bare \" approximation that ignores thermal fluctuations in the calculation of @xmath98 .",

    "thermal fluctuations contribute to a decrease in @xmath98 as a function of temperature .",
