    "the hubble space telescope calspec spectrophotometric standards , advertised to provide absolute fluxes good to about 1 - 2 % in the optical and near - infrared , constitute the preferred reference .",
    "the calspec absolute fluxes are based on model atmospheres for three hot da white dwarfs normalized to landolt @xmath4-band photometry ( bohlin 1996 , 2000 ; bohlin , dickinson & calzetti 2001 ) . in this calibration ,",

    "that the physics of da atmospheres is well - known , these objects are then promoted to space calibration sources ( see , e.g. , holberg et al .",

    "these uncertainties influence the predicted spectral energy distribution to a level of @xmath6 % throughout the optical and near - infrared .",
    "the solidity of the theoretically predicted relative fluxes can be appraised by comparing calculations with independent codes .",
    "for an effective temperature of 20,000 k , lte models computed by koester ( e.g. , kilic et al . 2007 ) predict continuum spectra that deviate from tlusty s by only 0.5 % in the optical and near - infrared , and the differences reach only 1% at 30,000 k , due in part to departures from local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) , as illustrates fig .",

    "also with relatively smooth continua dominated in the optical and near - infrared by bound - free hydrogen opacity , present several disadvantages .",
    "they show weak metal lines , are located at larger distances from earth , and some are surrounded by disks ( laureijs et al .",
    "2002 ) , which might disturb their spectral shapes in the infrared . furthermore",
    ", many early type stars rotate fast ( see the example of vega ; adelman & gulliver 1990 ) and , although this is hard to detect in the spectrum when the rotational axis is aligned with the line of sight , rotation can distort significantly their spectral energy distribution and broad - band colors ( prez hernndez et al .",

    "f - type subdwarfs such as the sdss standard ( bd @xmath7 4718 ; bohlin & gilliland 2004 ; ramrez et al .",
    "2006 ) are abundant in the turn - off of the galactic halo and thick - disk populations , but again , they are located at considerably larger distances , and their continua are influenced by both hydrogen and h@xmath8 photoionisation , with the contribution of the latter varying depending on the number of free electrons available , which makes their spectral shape dependent on their exact metal abundance , increasing the complexity of the model atmosphere calculations .",
    "in addition to the three fundamental da stars that set the calspec absolute fluxes , hubble space telescope ( hst ) spectrophotometry links observations of other stars ( some of which are da ) to the fundamental standards , expanding the calibration network to about two dozen objects throughout the sky . this is important , as three standards are not enough for accurate calibrations , in particular for ground - based observations where small angular separations between target and calibrator are a must .",
    "nonetheless , this two - step process may result in a loss of accuracy and , due to the miscellaneous nature of the secondary calibrators and the resulting large range in distance and extinction , significant variations in quality across the sky .",
    "the link between the secondary hst flux standards and the three primary ones depends on the calibration of the time - dependent response of the hst spectrographs .",
    "the risk of using secondary standards is nowhere more evident than in the recent update of vega s hst spectrophotometry . after considering charge transfer efficiency corrections for the stis ccd ( see goudfrooij et al .",
    "2006 ) , the slope in the paschen continuum was modified by about 2% .",
    "such a change implies a decrease in the inferred effective temperature from 9550 k to 9400 k ( bohlin 2007 ) , and in fact , it solves a long - standing discrepancy between the hst and the iue - ines flux scales ( garca - gil et al .",
    "2005 ) .    instead of using secondary standards ,",
    "based themselves of observations that are ultimately tied to the three white dwarfs chosen by bohlin and collaborators , the flux scale can be set in a single step using a larger number of well - behaved pure - hydrogen hot white dwarfs .",
    "but those must be first identified .    while bright flux standards have been favoured in the past ,",
    "there is a growing need for fainter standards .",
    "the sdss camera and spectrographs can not observe standards brighter than about 14 magnitude in their normal mode of operation : transfer delay integration ccd operation would not be feasible , and very short exposure times would lead to large errors in the fluxes .",
    "this situation is likely to become more exhacerbated for upcoming instrumentation .",
