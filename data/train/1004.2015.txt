    "the class of problems involving spontaneous and induced semiclassical processes with quantum fields invariably presents an interesting case study in nonperturbative calculations .",
    "the most discussed examples of such processes are the schwinger @xmath0 pair creation in an electric field  @xcite , the decay of false vacuum  @xcite and the breakup of metastable strings and walls  @xcite .",
    "a semiclassical treatment of such processes can be formulated in terms of a configuration in the euclidean space time , which is a solution to classical field equations and is called the bounce  @xcite .",
    "the considered processes can either proceed spontaneously or be induced by the presence of particles and by their collisions , such as in the false vacuum decay  @xcite , in the decay of metastable strings and walls  @xcite , and in the photon - stimulated schwinger process  @xcite . in terms of a euclidean - space treatment the case of induced processes requires one to consider the interaction of the particles with the semiclassical configuration .",
    "it has been recently suggested that such a consideration can be done using an indirect thermal method  @xcite , which appears to be simpler than a direct calculation of a relevant correlator  @xcite in the semiclassical background , especially if more than one quantum particle is involved .",
    "the thermal method allows one to find the rate of the induced process by appropriately interpreting the result for the spontaneous process at a small but nonzero temperature , where the thermal effects in the rate are contributed by all the @xmath1-particle states rather than by the vacuum state alone .",
    "the contribution of the states with a fixed number of particles can be extracted from the thermal rate and thus the decay rate induced by @xmath1 particles can be calculated .",
    "an alternative , and more direct , calculation employing correlators of field operators in the bounce background is readily tractable in the case of one particle , but becomes more cumbersome for processes with a larger number of particles .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that both methods yield the same result for the one photon induced schwinger pair creation .    in this paper",
    "we consider an application of both approaches to the case of interacting scalar particles in two dimensions .",
    "we consider two interacting scalar fields in the following setup .",
    "the potential for one of the fields @xmath2 is chosen as having the shape shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is well known that the system with such potential admits quantum tunneling from the metastable to the true vacuum , therefore one can discuss the spontaneous decay of the false vacuum @xcite . choosing the parameter of the potential asymmetry to be small and the mass of the corresponding field @xmath2 to be much larger than that of the second field @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , greatly simplifies the treatment . indeed , for a small difference of the vacuum energy density @xmath5 one can employ the so called thin wall approximation  @xcite .",
    "in this case the tunneling configuration is given by a disk of the radius r = , [ b_rad ] with the false vacuum outside of the disk and the true vacuum inside .",
    "the extent of the transition region between the two vacua is assumed to be much shorter than the radius @xmath6 ( the thin wall approximation ) , which is ensured by the condition @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 in eq.([b_rad ] ) is the mass associated with the transition region , @xmath9 .",
    "the smallness of the mass @xmath10 of the second field @xmath3 compared to @xmath11 guarantees that in the leading order there is no contribution to the interaction of the bubble ( bounce ) with other objects due to the self - action of the field @xmath2 but only due to the exchange of the light particle @xmath3 .",
    "the problem that is addressed here is that of the false vacuum decay stimulated either by the presence of one particle of the field @xmath3 or by a collision between two such particles .",
    "previously a similar problem was considered  @xcite for the particles of the field @xmath2 , which is always strongly coupled to the bounce in the sense that there are always zero and soft modes for this field localized on the bounce .",
    "our present problem is different in that we consider the catalysis of the process by particles of a second field @xmath3 that is only weakly coupled to the master field @xmath2 so that no anomalously soft modes for the field @xmath3 arise on the bounce . as a result",
    "we find closed formulas for the probability of an induced vacuum decay , which describe the onset of the expected semiclassical behavior similar to that the catalysis by the particles of the master field  @xcite , where the energy of the initial particle(s ) is transfered to the tunneling degree of freedom .",
    "since the main purpose of the present paper is an illustration of an application of two approaches to treatment of an induced semiclassical process , we limit ourselves , for simplicity , to a model in ( 1 + 1 ) space - time dimensions , while a generalization to higher dimensional models is quite straightforward .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we briefly describe the model used and reformulate the problem in the thin wall limit .",
    "in sec.3 we find the rate of the metastable vacuum decay at small but finite temperature .",
    "using the correspondence between the @xmath1-particle contribution and the rate at finite temperature we find the width of the @xmath3 particle and the probability of the collision - induced false vacuum decay in sec.4 .",
    "in sec.5 we discuss a calculation of the relevant field correlator in the bounce background , and thereby calculate anew the decay rate of a single @xmath3 particle .",
    "in sec.6 we discuss and summarize the results .",
    "we consider a model describing two real scalar fields in @xmath12 dimensions with the lagrangian =  ( _ ) ^ 2 +  ( _ ) ^ 2 - m ^ 2 c^ 2 - v ( ) - v _ int ( , ) , [ s_act ] where the potential @xmath13 has asymmetric form shown in fig.1 . for further uses",
    "this potential can be chosen as v ( ) =  ( ^ 2 -v ^ 2 ) ^ 2 -  ( +",
    "v ) . we also choose the interaction potential between the two scalar fields in such a way that it is not equal to zero only where the field @xmath2 differs from its vacuum values , for example v _",
    "int =  ( ^ 2 - v ^ 2 ) = ( ) c , [ int_pot ] with @xmath14 being a constant .",
    "as argued previously , the parameters of the lagrangian are assumed to be such that the mass of the field @xmath2 is much greater then that of the field @xmath3 , namely m m = v .    in the euclidean time",
    "the solution for the problem of tunneling ( metastable vacuum decay ) can be formulated in terms of a semiclassical solution , a bounce .",
    "this is a solution to the euclidean equations of motion interpolating between the two vacua separated by a domain wall .",
    "the decay rate is found by calculating the partition function around the bounce configuration =  ^ - s [ , c ] , [ path_int_f ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the sizes of the system along the euclidean time and spatial direction respectively . in the thin wall limit , when the size of the bounce is much greater than the thickness of the wall ( the inverse mass of the field @xmath2 ) @xmath17 , one can consider only the soft modes of the wall .",
    "then its dynamics is described in purely geometrical terms , namely the shape of the wall , which can be represented in polar coordinates by the function @xmath18 ( closed trajectory corresponding to the distorted bounce configuration ) .",
    "therefore the euclidean action of the system can be written in the following form s = - + d ^ 2 x  [  ( _ ) ^ 2 + m ^ 2 c^ 2 + ^(r ) c ] , [ e_act ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the length of the bounce boundary and the area it encircles , and the dot stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath21 . the density @xmath22 is proportional to the coefficient @xmath14 and it plays the role of the source for the @xmath3 field .",
    "it is obvious that in the discussed approximation the area , where the value of field @xmath2 substantially differs from the vacuum , is very thin and the support of the function @xmath22 coincides with the shape of the boundary of the bounce .",
    "hence , it has the form of a surface @xmath23-function ^ ( r ) ( t , x ) = g ( - r ( ) ) ,   g .",
    "[ dens ] as a result the partition function can be expressed as an integral over closed trajectories describing the shape of the boundary = r  ^ - s [ r , c ] , [ path_int ] with the action @xmath24 derived from eq.([e_act ] ) . at a small constant @xmath25",
    "the latter expression can be expanded in a power series in @xmath25 . therefore at a small coupling between the scalar fields one can find the decay rate of the false vacuum in terms of an expansion in powers of @xmath25 .",
    "the decay induced by @xmath1 particles of the field @xmath3 arises in the order @xmath26 , while the spontaneous vacuum transition proceeds at @xmath27 .",
    "the rate of the spontaneous decay is found from calculating the action on the bounce configuration ( [ b_rad ] ) and the determinant corresponding to the integration over small fluctuations around the tunneling trajectory , and is given by  @xcite =  [ - ] .",
    "[ zero_t ] in the following sections we calculate the rate of the induced decay by using two approaches , discussed in the introduction .",
    "as is already mentioned , one can use a thermal approach to extract  @xcite from the expression for the total process rate at a small but finite temperature the contribution of the processes induced by a specific number of particles present in the initial state .",
    "therefore we start with calculating the total rate of the false vacuum decay in a thermal bath .",
    "it is quite clear that at a sufficiently low temperature only the contribution of states containing particles of the field @xmath3 are relevant , while the contribution from the states with the @xmath2 excitations are suppressed by the gibbs factor @xmath28 .    at a low temperature",
    "one can consider the same effective euclidean action ( [ e_act ] ) , except that now the system lives on the cylinder with the period equal to the inverse temperature @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , one may consider the system living on the @xmath30 plane with periodic boundary conditions for the euclidean time coordinate @xmath31 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the use of the action from eq.([e_act ] ) is justified as long as the temperature satisfies the condition @xmath32 .",
    "however , we consider still much lower temperatures , such that a stronger condition @xmath33 is satisfied , which drastically simplifies the calculations . at such a small temperature ( equivalently , at a large period @xmath34 ) one still may use the same bounce configuration to calculate the partition function ( [ path_int ] ) .",
    "the zero temperature result corresponds to the leading order contribution at @xmath35 and is given by eq.([zero_t ] ) .",
    "the next to leading order corrections arise in fact from the exchange of the @xmath3 particle , since at @xmath36 there is no bounce deformation  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the exchange of @xmath3 can be classified into two types .",
    "one is the self action of the bounce independent of the temperature , it is labeled by ( a ) in the fig.2 .",
    "the second , labeled as ( b ) , is the interaction of the two copies of the bounce separated along the euclidean time by @xmath34 , @xmath37 , and so on .",
    "in fact , it is still a part of the self interaction of one and the same bounce , living on a cylinder , and this part clearly depends on the period of the cylinder and disappears when @xmath34 goes to infinity .",
    "we restrict our interest to the second type of contribution , since this is the only one that produces a nontrivial temperature dependence .    the contribution to the action due to the interaction of two copies of the bounce separated by @xmath34 can be found as usual by using the expression for the propagator of the scalar particle with mass @xmath10 . in @xmath12 dimensions",
    "the propagator @xmath38 satisfies the equation -d ( t , x ) + m ^ 2 d ( t , x ) = ^ ( 2 ) ( t , x ) , and is given by d(t , x ) = k _ 0 ( mr ) , where @xmath39 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath40 .",
    "the expression for the part of the action due to the interaction between two copies of the bounce then takes the form s _ ( 1 ) = - ^ b ( t _ 1 , x _ 1 ) d ( t _ 2 - t _",
    "1,x _ 2 - x _ 1 ) ^ b ( t_2-,x_2 ) d t _ 1 d x _ 1 d t _ 2 d x _ 2 , [ g_act_cor ] where @xmath41 is the density ( [ dens ] ) for the bounce located at the origin ^ b ( t , x ) = g ( - r ) .",
    "[ b_dens ] the shift in the argument of the second function @xmath42 clearly corresponds to the second copy of the bounce placed at @xmath43 .",
    "the extra factor of one half in the expression ( [ g_act_cor ] ) is due to the apparent double counting : the expression without this factor corresponds to the interaction between the two copies of the circle , while we need to consider the change in the action per one bounce ( per one period ) .    in order to find the integral in eq.([g_act_cor ] )",
    "one can readily notice that the function ( t _ 2 , x _ 2 ) = d _ 0 ( t _ 2 - t _ 1 , x _ 2 - x _ 1 ) ^ b ( t _ 1 , x _ 1 ) d t _ 1 d x _ 1 satisfies the equation  ( -+ m ^ 2 ) ( t , x ) = g ( - r ) .",
    "let @xmath44 be the polar coordinates corresponding to the cartesian ones @xmath45 .",
    "the solution to the equation ( [ g_r ] ) can then be found as ( r ) = \\ { g r i _ 0 ( m r ) k _ 0 ( mr ) ,   r > r , + g r i _ 0 ( mr ) k _ 0 ( mr ) ,   r < r , . and",
    "the integration over the first circle then reduces to the following k _ 0  ( m ) d _ 1 = 2 i _ 0 ( m r ) k _ 0 ( m r _ 2 ) , where @xmath46 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "performing the further integration over @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eq.([g_act_cor ] ) and summing over the contributions from the interaction with all copies one finally finds =  [ - - s ] , [ nzero_t ] with the total temperature dependent part of the action given by the following expression s = - 2 g ^ 2 r ^ 2 i _ 0 ^ 2 ( m r ) _",
    "n = 1 ^ k _ 0",
    "( m n ) , [ d_act ] expanding the expression ( [ nzero_t ] ) in @xmath49 at large @xmath34 one can find the low temperature behavior of the thermal corrections to the decay rate : =  [ - ]  ( 1 + 2 g ^ 2 r ^ 2 i _ 0 ^ 2 ( m r ) e ^ -m +  ) . as expected , these corrections are exponentially suppressed in the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the enhancement of the tunneling at a finite temperature arises through the stimulation of the process by the particles present in the bath .",
    "the dependence of the rate of the process induced by the @xmath3 particles on their energies then translates into the dependence on the temperature t after averaging over the thermal distribution of the particles with the standard density function n ( k ) = , where the energy is given by @xmath51 .",
    "the number of particles involved in each of the microscopic processes can be readily identified by the power of the factor @xmath52 . since the thermal correction ( [ d_act ] ) in the action is proportional to @xmath52 , the @xmath1-particle contribution to the thermal rate",
    "is given by the @xmath1-th power of @xmath49 in the expansion of the factor @xmath53 in the expression ( [ nzero_t ] ) .",
    "in particular , the one and two - particle contributions to the decay rate in a thermal state are given by & = &  [ - ]  ( - s ) , + & = &  [ - ]  ( s ) ^ 2 .",

    "the reason for this behavior is that iteration of the interaction in eq.([int_pot ] ) through the short - distance propagator of @xmath2 gives rise to terms with higher powers of @xmath3 , which however are suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath11 .    in summary .",
    "we have considered an illustrative 1 + 1 dimensional model of interacting scalar fields and demonstrated an application of the semiclassical thermal method to calculation of the rate of destruction of the false vacuum by one- and two- particle states of a light scalar field .",
    "for the one - particle state a direct calculation of the rate is also done in terms of the imaginary part of the particle propagator in the tunneling background . in the latter case",
