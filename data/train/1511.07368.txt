    "in recent times the study of our universe has received a great deal of attention since on the one hand , fundamental theoretical questions remain unanswered and on the other hand , we have now the opportunity to measure the cosmological parameters with an extraordinary precision . at present time our best theoretical cosmological model contains two unexplained forms of matter and energy called dark energy `` de '' and dark matter `` dm '' making up to @xmath4 of the energy content of the universe at present time .",
    "the existence of de was established more then a decade ago with the study of supernovas snia @xcite , showing that the universe in not only expanding , but besides it is accelerating .",
    "such behavior can be explained by the existence of a new form of energy , called dark energy with the `` strange '' property of generating an anti - gravitational effect , which can be implemented by a fluid with negative pressure .",
    "current observational experiments involve measurement on cmb or large scale structure `` lss '' or supernovae snia . taking a flat universe dominated at present time by matter and dark energy `` de '' , and using a constant equation of state @xmath5 for de ,",
    "one finds @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 from wmap9 results and @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 from planck and bao measurements .",
    "the constraint on curvature is @xmath12 for wmap9 and @xmath13 for planck using a @xmath14 model , i.e. @xmath15 for de .    at present time , the equation of state `` eos '' of de depends on the priors , choice of parameters and on the data used for the analysis as can be seen from the results obtained by either wmap or planck collaboration groups",
    ". a more precise determination of the eos of de will be carried out with e - boss and desi in which together with precise measurements of cmb such as will yield a better understanding of the dynamics of dark energy . with better data we should be able to study in more detail the nature of dark energy , a topic of major interest in the field . since the properties of dark energy are still under investigation , different de parametrization have been proposed to help discern on the dynamics of de , - .",
    "some of these de parametrization have the advantage of having a reduced number of parameters , but they may lack a physical motivation and may also be too restrictive",
    ". the evolution of de background may not be enough to distinguish between different de models and therefore the perturbations of de may be fundamental to differentiate between them .",
    "on the other hand , perhaps the best physically motivated candidates for dark energy are scalar fields , which can interact only via gravity or interact weakly with other fluids , e.g. interacting dark energy `` ide '' models .",
    "scalar fields have been widely studied in the literature and special interest was devoted to tracker fields , since in this case the behavior of the scalar field @xmath16 is weakly dependent on the initial conditions set at an early epoch , well before matter - radiation equality . in this class of models",
    "a fundamental question is why de is relevant now , also called the coincidence problem , and this can be understood by the insensitivity of the late time dynamics on the initial conditions of @xmath16 .",
    "however , tracker fields may not give the correct phenomenology since the have a large value of @xmath5 at present time .",
    "however , the main objective of this phenomenological approach is to determine the dynamics of de but does not address the question of the origin of de .    given that a satisfactory explanation of the nature of the two mayor contributors to the total energy of our universe , dark matter ( de ) and dark energy ( de ) , is still missing , we think it is a good idea to use a very interesting model of four - fermion interaction theory presented by nambu and jona - lasinio @xcite , the njl model .",
    "other possibility is to study njl for inflation see @xcite .",
    "alternatively , some interesting studies for de and dm have been proposed derived from gauge groups , similar to qcd in particle physics , and have been studied to understand the nature of dark energy and also dark matter .    from a particle physics point of view",
    ", the njl model is a very interesting theory involving a ( chiral ) symmetry breaking , the particle states before and after the breaking being related with two different physical phases .",
    "the defining lagrangian of the theory includes a single parameter , knew as the _ coupling _",
    "@xmath0 , but because it is indeed a non - renormalizable theory , one must introduce a second parameter in the form of a cut - off @xmath17 in the energy scale , in order to regularize it . of course , one can always consider it as a valid theory by watching that the energy keeps below the cut - off .",
    "the symmetry is broken for a `` strong '' coupling @xmath18 exceeding the critical value @xmath19 , in which case one has a fluid consisting of a _ fermion condensate _",
    ", effectively described by a scalar field . for @xmath20",
    "we have a `` weak '' coupling leading to a fluid of massless fermions .",
    "some years ago , the njl model was used to break supersymmetry in the context of superstring models .",
    "the breaking of susy is a consequence of the formation of a gaugino ( fermion fields ) condensate which are dynamically favored . in string",
    "theory the gauge coupling constant @xmath21 is field dependent , it depends on the dilaton field .",
    "so , having this in mind , we are motivated to allow here to have a field dependent coupling @xmath0 in our njl model , but our coupling @xmath0 is not to be confused with he gauge coupling constant @xmath21 .    one may consider a universe containing one or other of these njl fluid phases , and solve the cosmological dynamics .",
    "moreover one may consider additional `` barotropic '' fluids ( satisfying @xmath22 in the state equation @xmath23 ) , including dust - matter ( @xmath24 ) and radiation ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this was done in a previous work @xcite .",
    "there , it was found that a negative potential can be related to a strong coupling , and in its turn , because of the dynamical equations , it causes the scale factor eventually reaching a maximum value and further going to a contracting period forward in time , all the way to a vanishing value . in other words , a universe containing",
    "a njl fermion condensate phase ends up in a `` big crunch '' , _ even though _ a flat geometry is chosen from the beginning . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take reliably the effective description given in terms of the scalar field @xmath26 , a weak coupling can be related to a potential function of the form @xmath27 about the minimum , this implicating the njl fluid behaves as matter with an effective state coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "a universe containing such a fluid keeps expanding forever without acceleration .",
    "we see therefore , that the njl model has interesting properties from the cosmological point of view as well .",
    "+ nevertheless , there is nothing in the theory to induce a `` natural '' phase transition ( not put in by hand ) , since the original njl model contemplates only a _ constant _ coupling .",
    "however , we would like to investigate further the interesting features that the njl model has to offer , and find whether these could be exploited to work towards a solution of some of the unanswered questions in cosmology . to this end , we study how a dynamical coupling could be introduced , and see if this would allow such a phase transition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first summarize the main features of the model ( section [ njlrev ] ) .",
    "then we argue the introduction of a dynamical coupling , and present the necessary theory in treating two scalar fields in general ( section [ dyncoupling ] ) .",
    "next we proceed to study the potential obtained for our model in particular ( section [ analysispot ] ) .",
    "once this is done , we can move to solve the associated cosmological dynamics ( section [ cosmoexnjl ] ) , and finally synthesize our conclusions ( section [ conclu ] ) .",
    "in any theory , and in particular in field theory , we can consider to have a better model if it contains the least number of parameters and if the physical values of these parameters are `` natural '' , i.e. of order one .",
    "this was indeed one of our motivation to study the njl model and its cosmological consequences in our previous work .",
    "an inherent symmetry associated with a fermion field is the so called `` chiral '' symmetry , relating the `` right '' and `` left '' components of the field .",
    "we will start with the lagrangian functional satisfying this chiral symmetry , with the form @xmath29 , \\label{lnjl}\\ ] ] which is precisely the model of nambu and jona - lasinio with @xmath0 the coupling constant which is indeed constant .",
    "the field @xmath30 is a four - component spinor . for our present purposes",
    ", we would like to take an even simpler version of the theory by neglecting the pseudoscalar contribution .",
    "in doing so , an equivalent lagrangian to eq .",
    "( [ lnjl ] ) , concerning only the interaction term , can be written in the form @xmath31 where the parameter @xmath32 with dimension of mass was introduced to make all physical units consistent and the field @xmath26 , being a lorentz invariant , plays the role of an auxiliary scalar field . from eq.([lnjleq ] ) the equation of motion of the field @xmath26 gives @xmath33 from this expression the fermion mass @xmath34 and the tree level scalar potential @xmath35 , are seen to be @xmath36 as already mentioned in our previous work @xcite , the four - fermion interaction form of the theory makes it a non - renormalizable theory .",
    "the interaction can be expanded following conventional perturbation theory , and represented by feynman diagrams .",
    "+ however , the infinite number of fermion loops can be resumed giving a non - perturbative potential , which has to include a cut - off @xmath17 in the energy scale .",
    "the one - loop potential is given by @xmath37 the integral has an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath17 , while the mass of the fermions @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "if we define @xmath40 the one loop potential is given by @xmath41,\\ ] ] and the total effective scalar potential , taking the quantum corrections into account , is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 note that the coefficient `` @xmath44 '' is a constant .",
    "so , the effective potential written explicitly as a function of @xmath26 is @xmath45 .\\label{vefphi}\\ ] ] in the above expressions for the potential we have included a subindex `` i '' to distinguish it from additional terms to be considered later .",
    "+ as the complete analysis and explanations of the potential were already done in @xcite , here we will limit ourselves to remember the main facts : + for a fixed value of the coupling @xmath0 , such that @xmath20 , i.e. a `` weak '' coupling , with a critical value @xmath46 the potential is minimized at the origin @xmath47 , and can be taylor - expanded as @xmath48 about the origin . because @xmath20 , the coefficient multiplying @xmath49 is a positive quantity , so that it is @xmath50 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the field @xmath26 is a damped oscillation about the minimum , so that the pairing @xmath51 vanishes in average , @xmath52 , meaning that we have a massless fermion fluid . on the other hand ,",
    "if the coupling is fixed in a `` strong '' value @xmath18 , the potential is minimized in a non - trivial value @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is related to @xmath55 through equation ( [ xphi ] ) , and @xmath55 is the solution to the transcendental equation @xmath56 with the valuated potential at the minimum @xmath57 being a negative quantity .",
    "eq.([mgap ] ) is to the mass gap equation ( see @xcite ) derived from the infinite number of fermion bubbles , shown in fig.([fig00 ] ) , of the schwinger - dyson equation and a non trivial solution corresponds to a non - perturbative results since by equating a tree level result with a radiative correction one is necessarily in the non - perturbative regime and is effectively summing over the infinite number of fermion bubbles .",
    "a non trivial solution signals that a condensate is dynamically favoured . as the pairing @xmath58",
    "is energetically favored , in this case it is obtained a fermion condensate in the form of a scalar field @xmath26 . ) can be interpreted , from a geometrical point of view , as the intersection of the right line @xmath59 with the curve of the function @xmath60 $ ]",
    ". this way of visualizing a solution will be useful to us when we search extremum points for a more complicated potential , further along . ]    now , as we are looking forward to consider a dynamical field dependent coupling , we need to know the behavior of the potential ( [ vefphi ] ) as a function of two variables , @xmath26 and @xmath0 ( or @xmath61 and @xmath0 ) . for the function @xmath62 defined in eq .",
    "( [ af ] ) we have @xmath63 and for the derivative @xmath64.\\label{df}\\ ] ] by using equations ( [ limf ] ) we see that in the limit @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 if @xmath67 , but @xmath68 if @xmath69 .",
    "we summarize the different limit behaviors of the potential in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that the acceleration period begins _ before _ dark energy becomes dominant , @xmath70 .",
    "one may check that the same fact results in considering a cosmological constant instead of our scalar fields model .",
    "+ let us now estimate some real physical values .",
    "the total energy density today is about @xmath71 , and the dark energy contribution is @xmath72 .",
    "if we identify our non - barotropic njl fluid with de , we would have @xmath73 .",
    "now , in the limit of stabilized fields about the minimum the energy density of our njl fluid is @xmath74 .",
    "then , ( approximating @xmath75 ) we may write @xmath76 , and using the result obtained in equation ( [ vtotmin ] ) we find @xmath77.\\ ] ] this can be expressed in a suitable form with the help of the equation ( [ cond1a ] ) , and defining a coefficient @xmath78 as @xmath79.\\label{e0ep}\\ ] ] the more the quantity @xmath80 gets close to @xmath81 , the more smaller becomes the coefficient @xmath78 .",
    "so , the equations ( [ cond1a ] ) and ( [ e0ep ] ) with @xmath82 are constraints on the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "a discussion of the possibilities in this respect are not relevant for the time being , and will be left for another study .",
    "the fermion theory njl gives place to two physical phases , each arising depending on the coupling strength . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", each phase was seen to have different ( and interesting ) implications in considering a njl fluid as a material component of the universe . to take quantum corrections into account , an effective potential was calculated , and written in terms of an auxiliary scalar field @xmath26 , providing an useful equivalent description of the system . however , as the coupling is not a dynamical variable , each phase had to be treated one at once . in the present work",
    ", we argued that , by introducing a dynamical field dependent coupling @xmath0 in terms of additional scalar field @xmath85 we may obtain a dynamical cosmological phase transition . in order to such transition to be realized , the field @xmath85 must pass through a critical value @xmath86 along its evolution . to investigate the new two - field physical system",
    ", we studied a new two - dimensional potential , eq .",
    "( [ vexplicit1 ] ) , and defined some useful auxiliary functions @xmath87 eq . ( [ cond1a ] ) , @xmath88 eq .",
    "( [ cond12 ] ) .",
    "we have seen that the potential may , or may not have a non - trivial minimum ( i.e. other than the origin @xmath47 , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 for _ every cases _ ) depending on the set of parameters @xmath84 , @xmath83 , @xmath17 defining the relevant parameter @xmath91 . if @xmath92 , then the potential has only one minimum at the origin ; if on the other hand @xmath93 then the potential has two minima ( the origin and the non - trivial related to @xmath55 ) with the non - trivial @xmath1 ; and finally if @xmath94 , then the potential has also two minima ( the origin and the non - trivial ) , with @xmath3 ( see figures [ alphabeta1 ] , [ potver02 ] ) .",
    "now , according to the current observations , at present time the universe is in an accelerating period , caused _",
    "dark energy _ , emulated to a good extent by a cosmological constant .",
    "thus , we wonder whether our model can be useful to be compatible with this fact",
    ".    if the potential has @xmath92 ( i.e. no minima other than the origin ) a phase transition can certainly be realized , given that the fields minimize the potential , it would be enough to take an initial value @xmath95 . in this way the system would evolve from a strong coupling @xmath18 ( fermion condensate @xmath96 ) , to a weak coupling @xmath20 ( massless fermions @xmath47 ) , to finally stabilize at the origin .",
    "however , in this case there would be no acceleration , unless we choose such a large initial value of @xmath97 to make the condition @xmath98 from eq .",
    "( [ ac22 ] ) be satisfied .",
    "this , would be an `` early '' acceleration , because it arises before the system stabilizes on the minimum , and before allowing the matter and radiation components to dominate the universe and dilute to the present day values .",
    "so , this case is not useful as a possible model of dark energy .    on the other hand , for a potential with @xmath99 ( thus having two minima , at the origin and at a the non - trivial value ) we found that the relevant points are distributed as @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , if the initial amplitude is @xmath101 , the field can not evolve to an `` expected '' value @xmath102 , because @xmath103 , and the fields minimize the potential .",
    "even though one could still choose an initial amplitude in the form @xmath104 , in such a way that a phase transition could be realized , but in the opposite direction , from strong to weak coupling , this procedure however is not acceptable , because it would imply a fine tuning in the initial condition @xmath97 , besides not including an accelerating period .",
    "the only alternative left is that the initial amplitude begins in a region which could make the field stabilize in the non - trivial minimum .",
    "this requires @xmath105 , but then the field would be disabled to roll to @xmath86 .",
    "being so , as time increases the densities of matter and radiation decrease and the fields stabilize . with @xmath1",
    "the potential ends up dominating the total energy density and behaves like a cosmological constant , making the universe to accelerate . in this way ( adjusting the initial amplitude @xmath85 , and choosing the parameters to get the right potential @xmath1 ) , we could have a viable model of dark energy , but at the price of avoid the phase transition . +",
    "although the choosing could be seen as a defect of the model , this would be on the same footing than other physical theories , where one has to take the `` right '' parameters to fit the observations .",
    "moreover , from the philosophical point of view it is perhaps more appealing to postulate a qft particle than a non - understood kind of constant energy .",
    "+ finally , we must not forget that when the potential has a vanishing minimum @xmath106 , the fields dilute like @xmath107 , so the model can be seen as describing a matter component ( dark matter ? ) , and therefore still could offer a useful theory which may be worth to study further .",
