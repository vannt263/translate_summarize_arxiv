    "for example , @xmath6 can be such an instruction .",
    "this instruction is not always meaningful ( e.g. , the ninth and the thirteenth points may coincide and then they do not determine a line ) and it can allow choices ( which intersection point should we choose ) . if there is a `` good '' choice at each instruction such that the last instruction produces the point that we intend to construct , then the constructibility program _ works _ for the given data , that is , for the initial points . in our statements below , unless concrete data are mentioned , @xmath7    the cyclic polygon with side lengths @xmath8 , in this order , is denoted by @xmath9 . as usual , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , we define @xmath13 the acronym comes from `` non - constructible from side lengths '' .",
