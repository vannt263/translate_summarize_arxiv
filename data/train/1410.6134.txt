    "turbulence , be it classical or quantum , remains as a fundamental problem in the dynamics of fluids .",
    "its high complexity makes it a very difficult , yet a fascinating state of matter in which one of the challenges is to describe it in simple terms .",
    "while there does not exist a clear definition or specification of what turbulence should be , there are several aspects or signatures that indicate whether or not one is facing a turbulent flow .",
    "most notorious is the cascade of energy @xcite through vortices or eddies , in the classical case , or by a tangle of vortices @xcite in the quantum version . among the relevant questions one must deal with , specially in the quantum regime , is the initiation or generation of such a complex state@xcite and its characterization .",
    "@xcite these issues motivate the study presented in this article .",
    "we point out that there are already experimental realizations of quantum turbulence@xcite as well of studies of the route to turbulence.@xcite    in this work , through the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model@xcite of an ultracold quantum gas , and assuming that arbitrary phase - imprinted states can be generated@xcite we present here a survey of macroscopic excitations that lead a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , confined in an external harmonic potential , to stationary agitated or chaotic states that , under appropriate conditions , may be considered to pass through turbulent transients or remain as such .",
    "although the details of the model and of the different excitations that we explore are presented below , we want to advance here a general result that we find may be of relevance in a more complete study .",
    "this is the fact that the gp model is capable of showing a clear transfer of energy , initiated with the large scale imprinted excitation by external means , and ending up in an effective  stationary \" state , sometimes with a stable array of vortices with large scale collective excitations@xcite , and other times without traces of the initial excitation , but with the presence of bogoliubov phonons.@xcite the former shows spectra close to kolmogorov law @xmath1 , while the latter a spectral law with a positive exponent .",
    "we analyze the numerical solution of gp equation in terms of the spectra of the kinetic energy and in terms of power spectra of the time evolution of the steady state . while we do not claim that such an analysis permits discerning the presence of turbulence , we find that those spectra do serve as signatures of the reached stationary states as well of the evolution towards it .",
    "the mentioned decay into a stationary or steady state is not a true irreversible@xcite behavior of gp but actually a complicated non - linear dephasing effect , since gp obeys time - reversal invariance .",
    "the evolution appears as  irreversible \" but this is due to numerical rounding errors .",
    "we present a detailed study of such an effect in order to understand these stationary states .",
    "we believe it is relevant to take these aspects into account since dephasing contributions will compete with true irreversible development induced by actual dissipative effects - not considered in the present study . in this work ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the numerical solutions of the time - reversal invariant gp equation , valid for temperatures as close as possible to absolute zero , but we recognize that in order to make a direct comparison with actual experiments , being these at finite temperature , one must take into account dissipative effects .",
    "there are already efforts along these lines @xcite including the effects of the thermal cloud that surrounds a confined bec .",
    "true stationary states , of course , are found in those cases",
    "our model is summarized in the gross - pitaevskii equation@xcite for a three dimensional , one - component bec confined by an external potential , @xmath2 the mean - field interaction coupling term @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of bosonic atoms of mass @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the @xmath7-wave scattering length , assumed positive throughout .",
    "the gp wave function @xmath8 is normalized to one .",
    "although our numerical analysis will be limited to an isotropic harmonic potential @xmath9 , there are several comments and aspects that should be generic for any potential .",
    "in particular , due to the problem at hand , we are interested in also posing relevant questions in terms of a hydrodynamic formulation@xcite .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "using the transformation @xmath10 and the identification @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the particle density and @xmath13 may be interpreted as the fluid velocity field , one finds the following hydrodynamic equations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the stress tensor is , @xmath16 and with the additional condition that the fluid is irrotational @xmath17 .",
    "it is of interest to note that the stress tensor has a hydrostatic pressure @xmath18 , due to the interatomic interactions , and other volumetric and shear stresses of pure quantum origin , namely , all those proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "the above hydrodynamic equations have been also previously derived by grant.@xcite    as it is known , and we discuss and review it here , there is a ground stationary state , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the chemical potential and @xmath22 the ground state macroscopic wave function , solution to , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath5 given , the chemical potential @xmath21 and @xmath26 are uniquely given .",
    "the wave function @xmath22 can be accurately found numerically.@xcite this is our starting point for all the forthcoming calculations . from the hydrodynamic point of view , this fluid has an inhomogenous density @xmath27 and zero velocity field everywhere , @xmath28 .",
    "any macroscopic excitation on top of the state @xmath26 will necessarily evolve in time ( except perhaps a line vortex at an axis , but this is unstable@xcite ) .    while there may be many more excitations , we consider for the moment three of them , vortices , collective modes , such as breathing or scissors modes,@xcite and sound waves , or bogoliubov phonons,@xcite and their interactions .",
    "the line vortex , for @xmath29 , is the actual solution given by gross@xcite and pitaevskii@xcite , with zero density at the vortex and the velocity field yielding a non - zero circulation , @xmath30 with @xmath31 the topological charge . on the other extreme , we have that any small perturbation is composed of bogoliubov sound waves , as we now briefly review .",
    "let us assume a stationary solution to the equations , which is a uniform one @xmath32 if @xmath29 , and the non - uniform solution @xmath27 for the harmonic trap , discussed above . in both cases , the velocity field is zero everywhere , @xmath28 .",
    "let us now consider a perturbation in the free - field case , @xmath29 , @xmath33 then , a simple linearization of the hydrodynamic equations , eqs .",
    "( [ nfield ] ) and ( [ vfield ] ) , yields , @xmath34 this is a fourth - order wave equation whose solution is @xmath35 , with @xmath36 an arbitrary complex amplitude , yielding , @xmath37 which , as expected , is bogoliubov dispersion relation for the elementary excitations in a weakly - interacting bose gas @xcite .",
    "the velocity field is , in turn , found as @xmath38 , which shows that the waves ( phonons ) are longitudinal , also as expected .",
    "the third important excitation are those that are referred as collective , namely , excitations that involve the whole cloud , and that occur from such a length scale down to perhaps the vortex size , such as breathing or scissors modes .",
    "these can be studied in the thomas - fermi limit , namely , neglecting the kinetic energy in gp equation .",
    "a clear exposition of these modes may be found in the works of stringari and coworkers.@xcite suffice to say here that these are not uncoupled to the other excitations , vortices and phonons , as we will exemplify below .",
    "in this section we study the time evolution of several initial states , described in detail below . we analyze their decay to their respective ",
    "stationary \" states as well as the time evolution of frequency and wavenumber spectra of the different energy components of the motion .",
    "the different initial states are prepared , first , by allowing the system achieve its ground state @xmath22 ( for an isotropic harmonic potential of frequency @xmath39 ) and then by imprinting different types of vortex perturbations . in a typical case ,",
    "the initial state is @xmath40 where the imposed phase functions @xmath41 are equivalent to the generation of a velocity field representing a given vortex excitation .",
    "@xmath42 is the vortex topological charge .",
    "we study the crossing of two orthogonal vortices ( 3.1 ) ; the collision of two anti - vortices ( 3.2 ) ; an off - center vortex ring ( 3.3 ) ; a vortex of charge @xmath0 ( 3.4 ) ; and a tangle of 4 vortices ( 3.5 ) . in the parenthesis we have indicated the section below in which we analyze them .",
    "our calculations are performed using parallel computing with graphic processors units ( gpu ) , which allows us to develop large and fast calculations ; details of the numerical methods and programming will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we use a spatial grid of size @xmath43 , in double - precision and with time steps of @xmath44 , in dimensionless units @xmath45 , and with a coupling @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds fairly well to a gas of @xmath47 atoms of @xmath48rb in an isotropic trap of frequency @xmath49 hz with a scattering length @xmath50  , and with a dimensionless equilibrium chemical potential of @xmath51 19.63 .",
    "the unit of time corresponds to 0.00159 seconds .",
    "while we monitor wave function normalization , energy and angular momentum conservation in order to partially ensure numerical convergence of our calculations , we have also used a further dynamical criterion since we are interested in time evolution behavior rather than in static properties .",
    "this criterion arises from the observation that the prepared initial states all do seem to  relax \" to  stationary \" states .",
    "this is an important aspect to analyze since the lack of dissipation in gp equation should prevent the system from truly relaxing to a thermal equilibrium state . in the present case ,",
    "given that gp is time - reversal invariant , one faces a _ dephasing _ mechanism rather than a dissipative relaxing one .",
    "this is the more important for non - linear equations solved by numerical means which , because of their concomitant round - off errors , very commonly give rise to a loss of the intrinsic reversibility of the dynamical equation , thus yielding an apparent irreversible behavior .    to be more precise , gp as well as schrdinger equation , are time - reversal invariant under the transformation @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , if at any time @xmath54 we change @xmath8 to @xmath55 , the system returns to its initial state at a time @xmath56 . on the one hand",
    ", one expects that if time @xmath54 is very large , due to rounding errors , eventually the state will not return to its original one .",
    "that is , for long times we can no longer assert that the observed evolution does correspond to the original initial state . on the other hand , however , due to the non - linearity of the equation , and aided by numerical errors , the state of the system can reach what one may call  basins of attractions\",@xcite such that , once the state enters one of those , it does not leave them anymore .",
    "we call these states _ stationary_. we further find that , once the system reaches one of these states , time - reversal invariance is numerically restored .",
    "this is just an indication that those states are very stable , even against round off errors .",
    "this study is performed as follows .",
    "let @xmath57 be any of the initial states at time @xmath58 , and let @xmath59 its gp solution at time @xmath54 . at time",
    "@xmath60 we make the transformation @xmath61 , and evolve @xmath62 for another interval of time @xmath63 .",
    "time reversal invariance demands that @xmath64 .",
    "thus , for different times @xmath63 we calculate the so - called fidelity @xmath65 if there were no loss of time reversal invariance , @xmath66 for all times @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ fidelity0all ] we show such a calculation for all the cases we study for up to time @xmath67 .",
    "we see that case ( 3.1 ) is the most stable , followed by ( 3.3 ) , while ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) loose their time - reversal invariance for times longer than @xmath68 .",
    "interestingly , all relax to a clear stable stationary state , as we now show .",
    "however , while in the first two cases one can affirm that the stationary state corresponds to the initial state , for the latter three we can only say that the initial state is _ close _ to the basin of attraction of the reached stationary state .        in order to verify the stability of the stationary state , we first let the system achieve it .",
    "those states are typically reached by time @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we now calculate the fidelity at times @xmath70 with @xmath71 as the initial or reference state , that is , @xmath72 the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fidelity200all_v1 ] . with the exception of ( 3.4 ) that looses a bit of fidelity ,",
    "the rest appear very stable .        as part of the statistical analysis of both the time evolution and the stationary state properties , we present the spectra of the incompressible part of",
    "the kinetic energy.@xcite the spectra is calculated as @xmath73 of particular interest is the search for situations whether the incompressible spectra shows a kolmogorov law @xmath1 or not .",
    "in addition to the time evolution of the spectra , and in order to obtain a better understanding of the stationary state , we calculate the time evolution and the frequency spectrum of the modulus of the overlap between the state at the time @xmath71 and later times @xmath74 .",
    "this is @xmath75 we denote its fourier transform as @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "as we shall see , this function samples the contribution of different excitations in the stationary state .",
    "this information can be correlated with the spectra @xmath77 to elucidate whether the excitations are vortices , collective modes and/or phonons .      in this case , the initial state is given by two line vortices at orthogonal directions , see fig .",
    "[ cruzados ] , one with @xmath78 parallel to the @xmath79-axis at @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the other with @xmath82 parallel to the @xmath83 axis at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 as one may expect , see the set of snapshots for the magnitude of the velocity field in fig .",
    "[ cruzados ] , the vortices join and reconnect few times .",
    "we have observed three of these reconnections within a time interval of 50 units of time .",
    "then , the vortices stop crossing and become almost but not quite parallel and keep orbiting around each other , in a stationary state .",
    "this late state shows , on top of the orbiting vortices , an agitated fluid that appears to be a superposition of collective modes at different lenght scales , with the presence of few phonons .",
    "very interestingly , its incompressible energy espectra shows a scaling law quite close to kolmogorov law .",
    "this is the most stable case since it reaches its stationary state preserving its time - reversal invariance , showing a stable fidelity times much longer than 200 units of time .",
    "[ ene - cruzados ] shows the time evolution of the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "the compressible part is not shown being one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the spectrum does not show complicated features in its evolution , varying very little in time and showing that although the initial state is somewhat unstable , it does not differ much from the stationary one .",
    "one sees that the spectra is quite parallel to the @xmath1 line in the segment of the spectrum between the thomas - fermi and the vortex size wavenumbers , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the average slope is @xmath89 , very close to @xmath90 .",
    "as discussed further below , this appears as a signature of an algebraic cascade of energy between the vortices and collective excitations , with very little presence of phonons .",
    "the above conclusion may be further understood from the overlap evolution @xmath91 and its fourier transform , see eq .",
    "( [ overtime ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ overlapcross ] .",
    "the largest peak corresponds to rotation frequency of the two vortices ( @xmath92 ) , while the other frequencies are collective modes .",
    "the peaks in @xmath93 correspond also to motion of the whole cloud in the harmonic potential ; we have verified this by studying the center of mass motion of the cloud ( not shown here ) . as we shall verify below",
    ", there seems not be an important contribution of phonons in this case .",
    "[ collision ] shows the evolution of the collision of two parallel vortices , along the @xmath94-axis , one with topological charge @xmath95 , at @xmath85 , and the other with @xmath82 at @xmath80 , namely , @xmath96 the behavior of this case is quite the opposite of the two orthogonal vortices .",
    "referring to fig .",
    "[ collision ] , first , the vortices approach each other and reconnect ( @xmath97 ) forming two vortices at directions orthogonal to the original ones ( @xmath98 ) , but because they have opposite circulations , eventually join at their extrema forming a twisted vortex ring ( @xmath99 ) that further folds into itself .",
    "then , it appears to break into smaller rings that eventually become what appears to be a very agitated state with excitations and phonons at all length scales and in all directions .",
    "while this case seems similar to the crow instability in uniform systems,@xcite the presence of the trap may affect its evolution .",
    "this case has the shortest dephasing time , see fig .",
    "[ fidelity0all ] , yet , once it enters the stationary state remains there , see fig .",
    "[ fidelity200all_v1 ] .",
    "[ ene - collision ] shows the time evolution of the energy spectrum of the collision of two anti - vortices .",
    "the figure shows that the system quickly evolves towards a stationary state , which for late times @xmath100 , is composed by a collective oscillation of the cloud , with the first peak about @xmath87 followed by phonons excitations .",
    "the latter can be verified by the line indicated by @xmath101 which is the dispersion relation of bogolubov phonons , see eq .",
    "( [ bogo ] ) ; that is , the kinetic energy spectra is essentially composed of phonons in this case .",
    "compressible _ contribution of the kinetic energy ( not shown here ) is quite similar to the incompressible one of fig .",
    "[ ene - collision ] , corroborating that the excitations are compressible , namely , acoustic excitations .",
    "the overlap function @xmath102 in the stationary state , fig .",
    "[ overlapcoll ] , shows no presence of collective excitations , except for two peaks at @xmath93 and @xmath103 , which are motions of the center of mass , as directly verified from the numerical solution .",
    "this case corresponds to the evolution of a single vortex ring , shown in fig .",
    "[ ring ] , initially placed at @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with @xmath106 we find that , due to its circulation , the ring starts to move to one of the poles of the condensate , see fig .",
    "[ ring ] , expanding at the surface of the cloud ( @xmath107 ) , returning to the inside but then breaking into internal excitations and what appears to be a vortex at the edge of the condensate ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) . referring to fig .",
    "[ fidelity0all ] , we find that this excitation does not loose completely its time - reversal invariance , but again , once it enters the stationary state remains there , see fig .",
    "[ fidelity200all_v1 ] .",
    "as we see below , the stationary state is composed of oscillations of the whole cloud , some collective excitations and certainly with the presence of phonons .",
    "this can be concluded from the incompressible kinetic energy spectra and the overlap function , eq .",
    "( [ overtime ] ) , see figs .",
    "[ ene - ring ] and [ overlapringnc ] .",
    "this stationary state appears to be close to the previous one of two colliding anti vortices , with a strong presence of phonons , yet with collective modes playing a role .",
    "we now analyze the case in which the initial excitation is one that corresponds a single line vortex with topological charge @xmath0 , parallel to @xmath94 , at @xmath110 and @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "[ q2 ] . as it is known,@xcite vortices of charge @xmath112 are unstable and decay into two vortices of the same charge @xmath95 .",
    "this situation is exemplified in the snapshots of times @xmath113 , 25.0 and 40.0 of fig .",
    "it is very interesting to see that right after its creation , the vortex separates into two braid - entangled vortices , then these unwind until two stable parallel vortices are formed .",
    "the evolution dephases after 50 units of time , see fig .",
    "[ fidelity0all ] , yet , as with the other cases , it enters a stationary state .",
    "this stationary state , however , is the least stable , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fidelity200all_v1 ] , where the fidelity appears to be lossing about 5 % of its value , and thus , for longer times the system may migrate to a different stationary state .",
    "this remains to be verified . in any case , judging from figs .",
    "[ q2 ] and [ overlapq2 ] , the stationary state shows mainly vortex excitations with collective excitations of the cloud , similar to the case of crossed vortices .",
    "the large peak in the overlap spectrum in fig .",
    "[ overlapq2 ] corresponds the fast orbiting of the two vortices around each other .",
    "here we study a  tangle \" of 4 vortices , two anti - vortices parallel to the @xmath94-axis at random positions @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with @xmath116 and @xmath117 ; and two cross vortices , one parallel to the @xmath79-axis at @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and the other parallel to the @xmath120-axis at @xmath121 with @xmath122 , see fig .",
    "this would be the simplest tangle of vortices that may lead to turbulence , as originally suggested by tsubota et al.@xcite and also already treated by white et al.@xcite the evolution of this case is very harsh , similarly to the case of the colliding anti - vortices ; here we see that by @xmath123 there have been several reconnections and there remain two vortices only .",
    "then the system enters a very agitated flow , perhaps turbulent for times @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "unfortunately , the dephasing time is about 50 units of time , and therefore the true evolution is lost for longer times . nevertheless , after this agitated state , one of the vortices disappears , and the system enters a stable stationary state .",
    "these stages can also be observed in the evolution of the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum , fig .",
    "[ ene - tangle ] : the slope changes from nearly @xmath90 to @xmath126 to settle about @xmath127 .",
    "this last stage corresponds to the stationary state which , from observing the overlap @xmath102 and its fourier transform in fig .",
    "[ overlaprnd4 ] , appears to be composed of a fast vortex , the largest peak , with collective excitations and motion of the whole cloud , but with very few phonons .",
    "in this article we have analyzed the evolution of several representative vortex states in an otherwise equilibrium bose - einstein condensate , using gross - pitaevskii equation as a model for a gas at very low temperatures .",
    "our goal is to add to the understanding of evolution of complicated states in the search for different way to approach a quantum turbulent state . since the dynamics observed show different evolutions in wide time scales , and these types of studies can only be realized numerically",
    ", one must elucidate the role of rounding errors in determining the fate of the evolution .",
    "we have found that , depending on the initial state , the evolved state indeed looses its time - reversal invariance but it does so at different late times .",
    "moreover , the system reaches a stationary state in which time - reversal invariance is robust .    referring to the particular initial states considered in the present article",
    ", we can say that they are widely divided in two types : ( i ) those that at the stationary state have one vortex or an array of vortices with collective excitations of different sizes , and ( ii ) one with an agitated state that appears dominated by bogoliubov phonons . in case ( i ) one can include the initial states with two crossed vortices ( 3.1 ) , the vortex of charge two ( 3.4 ) and the tangle of 4 vortices ( 3.5 ) ; in case ( ii ) , we find the two vortex - antivortex system ( 3.2 ) and the off - center ring vortex ( 3.3 ) .",
    "this wide classification is based both on the spectra of the incompressible kinetic energy and in the overlap function in the stationary state , eq .",
    "( [ overtime ] ) . in the relevant wavenumber range , from @xmath87 to @xmath88 ,",
    "one corresponding to the size of the cloud , the other to the vortices cores , the kinetic energy spectra in case ( i ) appears to be close to the kolmogorov law @xmath1 , while in ( ii ) the spectra is very different even with positive power law , but that matches very well the bogoliubov phonon dispersion relation .    while finding a similarity with kolmogorov law @xmath1",
    "does not necessarily implies the presence of turbulence , it nevertheless suggests that there is a transfer or interchange of energy between excitations of different sizes , without a characteristic length scale , namely , with a scaling algebraic law .",
    "we recall that kolmogorov derivation of his law@xcite involves two parts , one in which a scaling law is assumed for the velocity flow , and a second one , the elucidation of the energy transfer rate between excitations of different sizes .",
    "the exponent @xmath90 is a consequence of the scaling , independent of the energy transfer mechanism .",
    "thus , we hypothesize that the observed similarity with kolmogorov law in some cases , essentially the same for the two crossed vortices , indicates the presence of energy transfer among excitations at different length scales : typically a single vortex , that while rotates and orbits around the cloud , interacts with collective cloud excitations .",
    "this gives rise clearly to a complicated , agitated flow . whether this may be considered  turbulence \" remains to be fully elucidated .",
    "it is , therefore , the more important to better understand why colliding antivortices and ring vortices appear to be destroyed , with the accompanying creation of acoustic phonons , yielding also a chaotic state , but with a completely spectral law .",
