    "this was mainly triggered by the observation of long - range electron transfer between intercalated donor and acceptor centers in  molecules in solution.@xcite subsequent experimental results @xcite were controversial as they showed different functional dependences of electron transfer rates on the donor - acceptor separation . thus , strong exponential fall - off@xcite typical for superexchange mediated transfer as well as a weak , algebraic dependence @xcite characteristic of sequential hopping processes were reported . meanwhile",
    ", theoretical work has led to an emerging picture where different mechanisms may coexist depending on base - pair sequence and energetics.@xcite    in parallel to these developments in the chemical physics community , dc transport experiments on as well as on poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) molecules between metal electrodes have been performed.@xcite several fundamental difficulties have to be surmounted in this kind of experiments : ( i ) how to create good contacts to the metal electrodes , ( ii ) how to control charge injection into the molecule , ( iii ) single molecule vs.  bundles of molecules and ( iv ) dry vs.  aqueous environments , among others . consequently , sample preparation and the specific experimental conditions turn out to be very critical for dna transport measurements .",

    "first principle approaches are the most suitable tools for this goal .",

    "the above model@xcite mimics the electronic structure of the complex poly(dg)-poly(dc)-backbone system by a tight - binding chain to which side chains are attached .",
    "electrons can hop along the central chain but not along the side chains . as a result",
    "a gap in the electronic spectrum opens .",
    "the gap is obviously temperature independent and the transmission near the fermi level would show a strong exponential dependence due to the absence of electronic states to support transport .",
    "an immediate issue that arises is how stable this electronic structure ,  two electronic bands separated by a gap , is against the influence of several factors which are known to play an important role in controlling charge propagation in  molecules , such as static and dynamic disorder@xcite and environment.@xcite in particular , the environment can act as a source of decoherence for a propagating electron ( or hole),@xcite it can induce structural fluctuations that support or restrict charge motion,@xcite or it can introduce additional electronic states within the fundamental gap.@xcite as it has been demonstrated experimentally , a modification of the humidity causes variations of orders of magnitude in the conductivity of .@xcite moreover , the recent single - molecule experiments of xu  @xcite suggest that the environment may strongly modified the low - bias transport properties of dna oligomers .",
    "in this paper we elaborate on the role played by the environment by addressing signatures of the bath in the electronic transmission spectrum of the dna wire in different coupling regimes : the mean - field approximation as well as weak - coupling and strong - coupling limits . anticipating some of our results ,",
    "we find that the semiconducting gap _ closes _ on the mean - field level as a result of thermal fluctuations . in the weak - coupling limit",

    "the electronic gap is an  intrinsic \" property of the system . on the contrary ,",
    "a bath - induced _ pseudo - gap _ is formed in the strong coupling limit ,  an energy region with a low ( but finite ) density of electronic states .",
    "we have further found in this regime that the transmission at the fermi level exponentially decreases with the wire length @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the decay rate @xmath6 is however rather small @xmath7 @xmath8 .",

    "the transmission on the side bands decreases when the disorder becomes stronger , but the pseudo - gap is still seen , although it is partially reduced with increasing disorder . ]    we have shown that a mean - field approximation can not fully catch the action of a dissipative environment on charge transport , because it only gives a real , energy independent contribution . indeed , while the mean - field approach leads to gap reduction with increasing temperature , bath fluctuations eventually lead to gap opening in the weak - coupling limit . we have further shown that a bath - induced pseudo - gap in the electronic spectrum can appear for strong electron - bath coupling giving a temperature - dependent background around the fermi energy . as a result the system may show with increasing temperature a transition from a tunneling to an activated behavior in the low - bias region when coupled to an external dissipative bath .",
    "an arrhenius - like temperature dependence of the transmission at the fermi level and a rather weak exponential dependence on the wire length were additionally found , indicating a strong contribution of incoherent pathways of the charge carriers",
