    "the coefficient of @xmath687 in   is @xmath688 , which has roots only at @xmath210 .",
    "thus , the only place on the real axis where @xmath375 can diverge to @xmath689 is @xmath210 , and the only places where two or more of the four algebraic roots of   can agree is where @xmath655 is one of the roots of the polynomial  .",
    "the polynomial   has real coefficients , so roots come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "thus @xmath657 , which is real and negative for @xmath690 , must remain real as @xmath655 approaches @xmath210 through negative numbers .",
    "moreover , setting @xmath375 equal to @xmath210 in   yields @xmath670 , so @xmath375 is nonvanishing on the negative real axis .",
    "therefore , @xmath657 is real and strictly negative for all @xmath691 .",
    "however , this is clearly not possible for the function @xmath679 , according to the asymptotics  .",
    "thus , @xmath682 and @xmath21 is not invertible .",
    "similar considerations show that the maximum of the support of @xmath654 , which is equal to @xmath692 , can only be one of the roots of  .",
    "however , the coefficients in the moment series   yield lower bounds on @xmath692 ; already the coefficient of @xmath294 yields @xmath693 .",
    "so @xmath692 equals the largest of the real roots of  , as required for the assertion in the proposition about @xmath694 .    from the asymptotics",
    ", we easily see that the density of the measure @xmath654 behaves asymptotically like @xmath695 as @xmath696 approaches @xmath210 from the right .",
    "thus , the distribution @xmath697 has density whose asymptotic expansion is @xmath698 as @xmath549 tends to @xmath210 from the right .",
    "we calculated the density of @xmath697 numerically ; a plot is in figure  [ fig : densplot ] ; for comparison purposes , the density @xmath699 of the quarter - circular element @xmath700 is plotted on the same grid , with the dashed line . for details",
