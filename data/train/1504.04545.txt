    "since being introduced in @xcite by quillen , model categories have long served as a means to work on homotopy theory . given a category ,",
    "quillen provides a list of necessary attributes on the category and three classes of maps , that allows one to give a decent description of the homotopy category obtained by formally inverting the class of weak equivalences .",
    "this work was paramount in extending results found in topological spaces to other categories .",
    "after their introduction , much has been done in the study of model categories and their associated homotopy categories .",
    "one particular instance of work that has been done is the localization of model categories found in the work of bousfield @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and presented in detail by hirschhorn in @xcite ( see [ locdef ] ) . by localizing a model category ,",
    "the class of weak equivalences can be extended , allowing one to have a larger variety of `` equivalent '' objects .    in this paper",
    "we consider the opposite of a localization , mainly a delocalization of a model category . by delocalizing we instead",
    "provide a model category with a smaller class of weak equivalences giving us the ability to expect extra structure on our class of weak equivalences .",
    "in particular , we define the notion of right bousfield delocalization and show that such a delocalization of a pair of model categories @xmath0 and @xmath1 exists when certain assumptions on @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be made .      in @xcite",
    "the author defines higher order hochschild cohomology of a @xmath3-algebra @xmath4 over a simplicial set @xmath5 with coefficients in @xmath6 ( denoted @xmath7 ) .",
    "the main result in this paper is determining what actions coefficient modules can take .",
    "one question that can be asked about this higher order hochschild cohomology is whether the cohomology is determined up to homotopy equivalence .",
    "the problem is that in general , given two simplicial sets , the allowable coefficient modules may not be able to have the same amounts of actions ( for example one simplicial set may only be able to work with symmetric bi - modules , while the other could work with bi - modules ) .",
    "one way to try and attack this problem is by considering an altered model category structure on the category of simplicial sets where weak equivalences are maps which are both weak equivalences and which preserve the `` allowable modules '' between the simplicial sets . from a localization standpoint ,",
    "this idea is somewhat backwards . when localizing a model category , we get a larger class of weak equivalences ,",
    "but here we are trying to restrict our class of weak equivalences . by considering a `` delocalization '' we may find what we are looking for .",
    "we start in section [ model ] by providing formal definitions for model categories , bousfield localization and weak factorization systems .",
    "we also use this section to set up the notation used in the paper . in section [ bous ]",
    "we define and give examples of a bousfield delocalization as well as an existence theorem . in section [ proof ]",
    "the main delocalization theorem is proved and in section [ diagram ] we consider diagram categories and their delocalizations .",
    "lastly , we revisit the original motivation by looking back at the homotopy invariance question for higher order hochschild cohomology in section [ hoch ] .",
    "in this paper we assume some familiarity with model categories and their localizations , but we use this section to provide a formal definition for both along with the notation used within this paper .",
    "much of what is provided here will be used throughout the proofs later on .",
    "to define a model category we make use of the following closely related concept introduced by joyal and tierney in @xcite and studied by riehl in @xcite .",

    "for the weak factorization systems , notice that @xmath23 is a weak factorization system since @xmath171 is defined to be the maps that have the left lifting property with respect to @xmath172 and any map @xmath173 has an associated pointed map @xmath174 which can be factored as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a cofibration and @xmath177 is an acyclic fibration , but by lemma [ lem ] , any component map of @xmath176 lifts with respect to pointed fibrations i.e. component maps of @xmath176 are in @xmath171 and by definition any component map of @xmath177 belongs to @xmath178 now , for @xmath22 any diagram of the form    @xmath14 \\matrix ( m )   [ matrix of math nodes , row sep=3em , column sep=3em , text height=1.5ex , text depth=0.25ex ] {   a & b   \\\\ c & d \\\\   } ; \\path[- > , thick , font=\\scriptsize ] ( m-1 - 1 ) edge   ( m-1 - 2 ) edge node[anchor = east ] { $ \\psi$ } ( m-2 - 1 ) ( m-1 - 2 ) edge node[anchor = west ] { $ \\varphi$ } ( m-2 - 2 ) ( m-2 - 1 )   edge   ( m-2 - 2 ) ;   \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) has a lift since by part @xmath97 any pointed map @xmath38 of @xmath119 which lifts with respect to all pointed acyclic fibrations which are also weak equivalences , lifts with respect to all pointed fibrations , but when considering the diagram above as a pointed diagram in @xmath119 we see that a lift does exist which gives a lift in @xmath9 as well . also , any map @xmath181 has a factorization since the associated pointed map in @xmath119 has a factorization @xmath182 where @xmath176 is an acyclic cofibration and @xmath177 is a fibration .",
    "@xmath176 is a cofibration which gives that component maps are in @xmath171 by lemma [ lem ] and @xmath176 is a weak equivalence so component maps are also weak equivalences and in @xmath183 we also see that component maps of @xmath177 are in @xmath184 but this gives that any composition of component maps from @xmath177 and @xmath176 form a factorization for @xmath185    to finish the proof we need to show that this model category structure on @xmath9 gives the same model category structure on @xmath119 when considering the objectwise fibration model category structure .",
    "this is a straight forward check of the defined weak equivalences and fibrations , so we leave the remainder of the proof to the reader .",
    "this brings us to the intersection delocalization theorem discussed in the beginning of the section .",
    "let @xmath9 be a co complete and complete category and @xmath58 be a small category .",
    "given two model category structures on @xmath119 denoted @xmath186 and @xmath187 which both induce a model category structure on @xmath9 ( see theorem [ diagdown ] ) where the right bousfield delocalization model category @xmath188 exists and with the assumption that @xmath188 satisfies part @xmath97 of theorem [ diagdown ] then there exists a model category structure @xmath189 on @xmath9 whose associated objectwise fibration model category structure on @xmath119 agrees with @xmath188 and furthermore @xmath189 and @xmath190 agree .",
    "the proof of this theorem is a straight forward check that @xmath188 satisfies the assumptions of theorem [ diagdown ] .",
    "once this is done , it is clear that @xmath189 and @xmath190 agree by the defined classes of maps .",
    "although it was the original motivation for this work , in this section we show that a right intersected delocalization does not seem to fit when trying to determine whether higher order hochschild cohomology is homotopy invariant .",
    "recall that we would like to consider the category of pointed simplicial sets where weak equivalences are maps which are traditional weak equivalences of pointed simplicial sets , but which also preserve the types of modules which can be used for each simplicial set .    by using a right bousfield delocalization of the traditional model category structure on pointed simplicial sets",
    ", we see that the fibrations would remain the same , but this also implies that the acyclic cofibrations would remain the same .",
    "this is problematic because one could easily come up with maps which would still be considered weak equivalences although the modules between the two simplicial sets differ . for an example , consider the smallest simplicial set for @xmath191 ( with one non - degenerate 0-simplex and one non - degenerate 1-simplex ) as the first simplicial set . for the second simplicial set",
    "consider the same simplicial decomposition of @xmath192 but in addition we will add a 1-simplex whose 0th face is identified with the original 0-simplex .",
    "there is a natural inclusion of pointed simplicial sets , which is both a weak equivalence of simplicial sets and a cofibration , but the coefficient modules do not agree .",

    "i would also like to thank my wife for her continued support ."
