    "interest in small robotic devices has soared in the last two decades , leading engineers to turn towards nature for inspiration and spurring the fields of biomimetics and bioinspired design .",
    "nature has evolved diverse solutions to animal locomotion in the forms of flapping flight , swimming , walking , slithering , jumping , and gliding .",
    "at least thirty independent animal lineages have evolved gliding flight,@xcite but only one animal glides without any appendages : the flying snake .",
    "three species of snakes in the genus _",
    "chrysopelea _ are known to glide.@xcite they inhabit lowland tropical forests in southeast and south asia and have a peculiar behavior : they jump from tree branches to start a glide to the ground or other vegetation , possibly as a way to escape a threat or to travel more efficiently .",
    "their gliding ability is surprisingly good , and one species of flying snake , _ chrysopelea paradisi _ ( the paradise tree snake ) , has also been observed to turn in mid - air.@xcite    like all snakes , _",
    "chrysopelea paradisi _ has a cylindrical body with roughly circular cross - section .",
    "but when it glides , this snake reconfigures its body to assume a flatter profile . during the glide ,",
    "the snake undulates laterally and the parts of the body that are perpendicular to the direction of motion act as lift - generating ` wings'.@xcite as in conventional wings , the cross - sectional shape of the snake s body must play an important role .",
    "early studies indicated that it may even outperform other airfoil shapes in the reynolds number regime at which the snakes glide ( @xmath1500015,000).@xcite    the first investigations into the aerodynamic characteristics of the flying snake s body profile were made by miklasz et al.@xcite they tested sections of tubing that approximated the snake s cross - sectional geometry as filled circular arcs , and encountered some unexpected aerodynamics .",
    "the lift measured on the sections increased with angle of attack ( aoa ) up to @xmath2 , then decreased gently without experiencing catastrophic stall , and the maximum lift coefficient ( @xmath3 ) appeared as a noticeable spike at the stall angle ( defined as the angle of attack at which lift is maximum ) .",
    "holden et al.,@xcite followed with the first study of a model using an anatomically accurate cross - section .",
    "they observed a spike in the lift curve at aoa @xmath0 for flows with reynolds numbers 9000 and higher .",
    "the maximum lift coefficient was 1.9 , which is unexpectedly high , given the unconventional shape and reynolds number range.@xcite the counter - intuitively high lift observed in both studies suggests a lift - enhancement mechanism .",
    "holden et al .",
    "inferred that the extra lift on the body was due to suction by vortices on the dorsal side of the airfoil .",
    "however , the flow mechanism responsible for the enhanced lift by the flying snake s profile has yet to be identified .    in the present study",
    ", we aim to answer the question : what is the mechanism of lift enhancement created by the flying snake s cross - sectional shape ? to address this , we ran two - dimensional simulations of flow over the anatomical cross - section of the snake .",
    "we computed the flow at various angles of attack at low reynolds numbers starting from @xmath4 and increasing .",
    "we found that a marked peak in the lift coefficient does appear at aoa @xmath5 for @xmath6 and above .",
    "hence , our simulations were able to capture some of the unique lift characteristics observed in the physical experiments of holden et al .",
    "aiming to explain the lift mechanism , we analyzed vorticity visualizations of the wake , time - averaged pressure fields , surface pressure distributions , swirling strength , and wake - vortex trajectories .",
    "although we performed two - dimensional simulations of flow over the cross - section of the snake , we recognize that three - dimensional effects are present at this reynolds - number regime@xcite .",
    "further 3-d and unsteady mechanisms due to the motion of the snake likely play a role in real gliding ( we discuss these effects in section [ discussion ] ) . despite the simplification of the gliding system , the two - dimensional simulations in this study",
    "provide insight into flows at reynolds numbers @xmath7@xmath8 ( sometimes called ` ultra - low ' reynolds numbers in the aeronautics literature@xcite ) where studies @xcite are scarce compared to traditional applications in aeronautics .",
    "_ c.  paradisi _ and other gliding snakes make use of unique kinematics , illustrated in figure [ fig : snakedive ] .",
    "the glide begins with a ballistic dive from a tree branch : the snake launches itself with a horizontal velocity and falls with a relatively straight posture . immediately after the jump ,",
    "it spreads its ribs apart and nearly doubles the width of its body , changing its cross - section from the cylindrical shape to a flattened shape@xcite ( see sketch in figure [ fig : snakeribs ] ) .",
    "the profile can be described as a rounded triangle with fore - aft symmetry and overhanging lips at the leading and trailing edges.@xcite figure [ fig : snakecs ] shows the anatomically accurate cross - section geometry of the paradise tree snake in the airborne configuration.@xcite the glide angle during the ballistic dive can reach a maximum of about @xmath9 degrees,@xcite while the snake gains speed , changes its posture to an @xmath10-shape and begins undulating laterally .",
    "it thus uses its body as a continuously reconfiguring wing that generates lift .",
    "the speed of descent ( i.e. ,  the rate at which the snake is sinking vertically ) peaks and then decreases , while the trajectory transitions to the shallowing glide phase of the flight .",
    "equilibrium glides have rarely been observed under experimental conditions,@xcite and the glide angle usually keeps decreasing without attaining a constant value before the end of the descent . in field observations ,",
    "the snakes cover a horizontal distance of about 10 m , on average , when jumping from a height of about 9 m. glide angles as low as @xmath11 have been observed towards the end of the descent.@xcite        during a glide , the snake moves its head side - to - side , sending traveling waves down the body , as illustrated in figure [ fig : snakemotion ] ( not to scale ) . with the body forming a wide @xmath10-shape at an angle with respect to the glide trajectory , long sections of the flattened body that are perpendicular to the direction of motion generate lift .",
    "compared to terrestrial motion,@xcite the undulation frequency in air ( 12 hz ) is lower and the amplitude ( 1017% snout - vent length ) is higher.@xcite as the body moves forward along the glide path , the fore and aft edges of the body repeatedly swap , which is not a problem aerodynamically thanks to the fore - aft symmetry .",
    "all portions of the body move in the vertical axis as well , with the most prominent motion occurring in the posterior end .",
    "the kinematics of gliding in the paradise tree snake are complex and various factors may contribute to the generation of lift .",
    "it is difficult to study the unsteady aerodynamics of the snake by incorporating simultaneously all of the elements of its natural glide .",
    "but as with any airfoil , we expect the cross - sectional shape to play an important role in the aerodynamics .",
    "this cross - section is thick compared to conventional airfoils , and is better described as a lifting bluff body.@xcite    miklasz et al.@xcite were the first to investigate the role of the profile , using wind - tunnel testing of stationary models resembling the snake s cross - section .",
    "the models consisted of segments perpendicular to the flow , with simple geometrical shapes meant to approximate a snake s straight portions of the body ( circular pipes cut to make a semi - circular , filled , half - filled , or empty cylindrical section ) .",
    "their experiments provided measurements of lift and drag at various angles of attack ( aoa ) in a flow with reynolds number 15,000",
    ". the maximum lift ( @xmath12 ) occurred at an angle of attack of @xmath13 and the drag remained approximately the same between @xmath14 and @xmath13 , thus causing a spike in the polar plot ( where the lift coefficient is plotted against the drag coefficient ) .",
    "near - maximal lift was also observed in a wide range of angles of attack ( @xmath15@xmath13 ) . beyond aoa @xmath13 , in the post - stall region , the lift drops gradually while the drag increases rapidly .",
    "this region is characterized by flow separating at the leading edge , resulting in some of the flow being deflected upwards and consequently generating a wide wake .",
    "miklasz et al .",
    "also tested tandem models finding that the downstream section experienced higher lift when placed below the wake of the upstream model , at horizontal separations up to five chord lengths .",
    "a subsequent study by holden et al.@xcite was the first to use models with an anatomically accurate cross - section based on _",
    "c.  paradisi_. they tested the models in a water tunnel at reynolds numbers in the range 300015,000 and used time - resolved digital particle image velocimetry ( trdpiv).@xcite plotting the experimental lift curves , they show a peak in lift coefficient at aoa @xmath5 , with a maximum @xmath16 between 1.1 and 1.9 , increasing with reynolds number . for reynolds numbers 9000 and above",
    ", the maximum @xmath16 also appeared as a noticeable spike  about 30% higher than at any other angle of attack . in the case of drag , at reynolds 7000 and below @xmath17 grows gradually until @xmath0 aoa and then increases steeply in the post - stall region .",
    "but for reynolds 9000 and higher , the drag coefficients at @xmath13 and @xmath0 aoa are the same , similar to the result by miklasz et al .",
    "high values of lift coefficient were maintained in the range @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "the peak in lift at @xmath5 is an unexpected feature of the snake s cross - section and the value @xmath20 is considered high for an airfoil at this reynolds number.@xcite but gliding and flying animals have surprised researchers before with their natural abilities and performance.@xcite",
    "we solved the navier - stokes equations using an immersed boundary method ( ibm ) .",
    "our implementation uses a finite - difference discretization of the system of equations in a projection - based formulation proposed by taira & colonius.@xcite for the convection terms , we used an explicit adams - bashforth time - stepping scheme , with a crank - nicolson scheme for the diffusion terms .",
    "the spatial derivatives for the convection terms were calculated using a second - order symmetric conservative scheme @xcite and the diffusion terms were calculated using central differences .",
    "the formal spatial order of accuracy of the method is second order everywhere except near the solid boundaries , where it is first order .",
    "the temporal order of accuracy is first order , by virtue of the projection method used to step forward in time . throughout this study , we performed direct numerical simulations of two - dimensional , unsteady , incompressible flow over the cross - section of the snake .",
    "we used an accurate geometry for the cross - section of the snake , as determined by socha @xcite and used in a previous study with physical models .",
    "@xcite we discretized the flow domain using a stretching cartesian grid , as shown in figure [ fig : grid ] .",
    "the cross - section of the snake was scaled such that the chord length @xmath21 ( defined , as in previous studies , as the maximum width of the profile ) was equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the body was placed at the center of a domain that spanned the region @xmath23\\times[-15,15]$ ] , a size chosen so that the velocity of the fluid at the boundaries could be fixed to the uniform velocity of the free stream ( @xmath24 ) without affecting the solution .",

    "the reynolds number in the simulations varied in the range 5003000 , in increments of 500 , and the angles of attack were varied in the range of @xmath30@xmath31 in steps of @xmath32 .",
    "flows were impulsively started , and run for a sufficiently long period of time until periodic vortex shedding was obtained .",
    "we simulated 80 time units of the unsteady flow in each run . with a time step of @xmath33 , this required 200,000 time steps for each run .",
    "we computed the flow over an impulsively started cylinder at @xmath34 with these same simulation parameters and grid , and the results matched well against past simulations .",
    "@xcite we also conducted a grid - independence study by computing the flow over the cross - section at @xmath6 and angles of attack @xmath13 and @xmath0 , using two different grids and calculating the average lift and drag coefficients in each case .",
    "the primary measure of grid refinement used is the width @xmath35 of the square cells near the body , which are the smallest cells in the grid .",

    "here , we present a similar analysis for the flow over the snake s cross - section at reynolds numbers 1000 and 2000the lift curve of the latter exhibits the spike at @xmath37 and the former does not .",
    "figure [ fig : sketch ] shows a sketch of the near - wake region , indicating the terms that we will use to describe the flow .",
    "figure [ fig : vconts1k30 ] shows that at @xmath63 and aoa  @xmath2 , the primary vortex generated on the dorsal side of the body induces a region of secondary vorticity .",
    "the boundary layer feeding the primary vortex at this reynolds number is thick and the secondary vorticity is relatively weak .",
    "the primary vortex generated at the trailing edge interacts with the dorsal primary vortex , straining it and weakening it .",
    "a similar flow pattern is observed at @xmath37 for this reynolds number ( not shown ) .        at the higher reynolds number of 2000 ,",
    "the vortices are stronger and more compact , as expected .",
    "but the flow fields at angles of attack @xmath13 and @xmath0 are qualitatively different from each other . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the trailing - edge vortex is strong enough to weaken , stretch , and split the dorsal primary vortex into two ( see figure [ subfig : vort2k30 ] ) , resulting in a wake that consists of single vortices on top and pairs of vortices at the bottom of the vortex street .",
    "this wake pattern appears at this reynolds number for angles of attack @xmath2 and lower .",
    "but at @xmath37 , the stronger vortex on the dorsal side induces a stronger secondary vorticity ( figure [ subfig : vc2k35a ] ) .",
    "the vortices along the dorsal surface are associated with an enhanced suction all along the upper side of the body , as seen in figure [ subfig : surfp2k ] . as the secondary vorticity infiltrates the primary vortex , a new second vortex of negative sign is formed by the shear layer on the dorsal surface ( figures [ subfig : vc2k35b ] and [ subfig : vc2k35c ] ) .",
    "the shear layer on the dorsal side separates near the leading edge , as evidenced by the positive vorticity near the surface in figures [ subfig : vc2k35c ] and [ subfig : vc2k35d ] .",
    "the separated shear layer does not stall , but instead rolls up into the new vortex of negative sign due to the influence of the secondary vortex .",
    "this new second vortex forms a dipole with the secondary vorticity ( figure [ subfig : vc2k35c ] ) and the vortices are pushed towards the profile s surface .",
    "as the primary vortex convects away from the body , the secondary vorticity weakens ( figure [ subfig : vc2k35d ] ) and the second vortex formed due to the separated shear layer initiates a new primary vortex ( figure [ subfig : vc2k35e ] ) that remains close to the body and contributes to the enhanced suction on the dorsal surface .",
    "the trajectory plots in figure [ fig : trajectories ] show that the dorsal primary vortex for the case when @xmath6 and @xmath37 indeed forms and remains closer to the body surface as compared to the other cases .",
    "the swirling strength plots at @xmath6 ( figure [ fig : qvalues ] ) are also consistent with these interpretations . at the instant when lift is minimum",
    ", the flow remains attached at the leading edge for the case when @xmath36 , but is separated when @xmath37 .",
    "regions of high swirling strength correspond to regions of low pressure in the flow , as on the front half of the dorsal surface . at the instant of maximum instantaneous lift ,",
    "when @xmath37 swirling strength is higher at the locations of the secondary vorticity and of the new second vortex , associated with a lowering of pressure across the dorsal surface and not just at the leading edge .",
    "both the minima and maxima of the instantaneous lift increase sharply at @xmath37 ( see figure [ fig : unsteadylift ] ) .",
    "one phenomenon that occurs at this range of reynolds number for flows over bluff bodies is the instability of the shear layer . for circular cylinders , kelvin - helmholtz instability of the shear layers",
    "is observed for flows with reynolds numbers approximately 1200 and higher.@xcite this is a two - dimensional phenomenon , and causes an increase in the 2-d reynolds stresses , and subsequently increases base suction.@xcite for the snake s cross - section at @xmath6 and @xmath37 , the separated shear layer on the dorsal side is also subject to this instability and can form small - scale vortices that eventually merge into the primary vortices .",
    "this could explain why the vortices are stronger and remain closer to the body . at lower angles of attack",
    ", the boundary layer is attached to the body and the instability is not manifested , which implies a reduced value of base suction , and subsequently lift and drag .    as mentioned at the beginning of this section",
    ", the enhanced lift occurs at the same angle of attack in previous experiments with the cross - section of the snake , but in a different range of reynolds number .",
    "this difference reflects the limitations of our study , which only computes two - dimensional flow .",
    "experiments with bluff bodies show that beyond a certain reynolds number ( @xmath75 for circular cylinders ) , three - dimensional instabilities produce steam - wise vortices in the wake.@xcite the formation and effect of these vortices are more pronounced for bluff bodies ",
    "they increase the reynolds stresses in the wake of the cylinder , and wake vortices are formed further from the body surface , causing a decrease in the base suction when compared to two - dimensional simulations of the same flow .",
    "@xcite hence , 2-d simulations overestimate the unsteady lift and drag forces .",
    "this is also observed in our computed values of lift and drag for the snake model when compared to the experiments of holden et al.@xcite taking these facts into account , the simulations we report here can be considered a reduced model , one whose utility we could not assert _ a - priori_. it is perhaps a surprising result that a peak in lift is in fact obtained in the 2d simulations , as observed in the experiments .",
    "we surmise that the discrepancy in reynolds number range where the enhanced lift appears can be ascribed to 3d disturbances , which inhibit the mechanism responsible for the peak in lift , so that it can only manifest itself at higher reynolds number when the wake vortices are stronger and more compact .",
    "a flying snake in the field exhibits complex three - dimensional motions and a number of other factors could affect its aerodynamics , some of which we briefly list here .",
    "the finite size of the sections generating lift means that wingtip vortices will be generated , causing a decrease in lift and an increase in drag .",
    "the @xmath10-shape of the snake in the air suggests that multiple segments of the snake body can generate lift simultaneously , and the wake of the section furthest upstream could have an effect on the downstream sections . a preliminary result by miklasz et al.@xcite with two tandem models whose cross - sections approximated the snake geometry found that the value of the lift - to - drag ratio of the downstream section could increase by as much as 54% , depending on its position in the wake .",
    "the undulatory motion of the snake in the air means that the body also moves laterally in addition to moving forward along the glide path .",
    "the sideways motion may generate spanwise flow , which has been known to stabilize leading - edge vortices @xcite and increase the lift on the body .",
    "another mechanism that we do not know if the snake makes use of is thrust generation due to heaving or pitching motions of its body . @xcite",
    "fluid - structure interactions could also be present .    without discounting the limitations of two - dimensional models , we have sought to characterize the wake mechanism that could explain the lift enhancement on the snake s cross - section in this work .",
    "the results give insight into the vortex structures that are involved in this mechanism and suggest new directions to interrogate the flow in three - dimensional studies .",
    "these constitute future work that we aim to carry out once the appropriate extensions to the code have been completed .",
    "we studied computationally the aerodynamics of a species of flying snake , _ chrysopelea paradisi _ , by simulating two - dimensional incompressible flow over the cross - sectional shape of the snake during gliding flight .",
    "we obtained lift and drag characteristics of this shape in the reynolds number range 5003000 . in flows with reynolds numbers 2000 and beyond , the lift curve showed a sharp increase at an angle of attack of @xmath0 , followed by a gradual stall .",
    "this behavior is similar to that observed previously in experimental studies of cylindrical sections with the same cross section , for reynolds numbers 9000 and above .",
    "our unsteady simulations reveal that in flows with reynolds number 2000 and above and at angle of attack @xmath0 , the 2-d flow separates at the leading edge but does not produce a stall .",
    "the free shear layer thus generated over the dorsal surface of the body can roll up and interact with secondary vorticity , resulting in vortices remaining closer to the surface and an associated increase in lift .",
    "differences between the experiments and simulations in the magnitude of the force coefficients and the value of the threshold reynolds number beyond which the phenomenon is observed may be attributed to the three - dimensional effects .",
    "the code , running scripts and data necessary to run the computations that produced the results of this paper can all be found online , and are shared openly .",
