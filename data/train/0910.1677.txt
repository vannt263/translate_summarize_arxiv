    "one of the most challenging tasks for unravelling the partonic structure of hadrons is mapping the distribution of the spin of the proton onto its constituents . to this aim ,",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds)@xcite@xmath0@xcite and transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds)@xcite have proved to be among the most useful tools .",
    "gpds provide a new method of spatial imaging of the nucleon@xcite , through the definition of impact - parameter dependent spin densities which reveal the correlations between the quark distributions in transverse - coordinate space and longitudinal momentum for different quark and target polarizations . on the other hand , tmds contain novel and direct three - dimensional information about the strength of different spin - spin and spin - orbit correlations in the momentum space .",
    "although gpds and tmds can be seen as two different limiting cases of the same generalized parton - correlation functions , no - model independent relations between the two classes of objects has been obtained so far@xcite . a convenient way to make explicit which kind of information on hadron structure",
    "is contained in these quantities is the representation in terms of overlap of light - cone wave functions ( lcwfs ) which are the probability amplitudes to find a given @xmath1-parton configuration in the fock - space expansion of the hadron state@xcite . in the following",
    ", we will confine our analysis to the three - quark sector , by truncating the light - cone expansion of the nucleon state to the minimal fock - space configuration .",
    "the three - quark component of the nucleon has been studied extensively in the literature@xcite@xmath0@xcite in terms of quark distribution amplitudes defined as hadron - to - vacuum transition matrix elements of non - local gauge - invariant light - cone operators . unlike these works , the authors of refs.@xcite considered the wave - function amplitudes keeping full transverse - momentum dependence of partons and proposed a systematic way to enumerate independent amplitudes of a lcwf which parametrize the different orbital angular momentum components of the nucleon state .",
    "in particular , the three - quark lcwf involves six independent amplitudes corresponding to different combinations of quark orbital angular momentum and helicity . with such amplitudes",
    "one can obtain a model - independent representation for the quark contribution to tmds and gpds which emphasizes the role of the different orbital angular momentum components .",
    "one could then choose a phenomenological approach parametrizing the light - cone amplitudes and fitting observables related to tmds and gpds to data . here",
    "we will adopt a light - cone constituent quark model ( cqm ) which has been successfully applied in the calculation of the electroweak properties of the nucleon@xcite . as outlined in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the starting point is the three - quark wave function obtained as solution of the schrdinger - like eigenvalue equation in the instant - form dynamics .",
    "the corresponding solution in light - cone dynamics is obtained through the unitary transformation represented by product of melosh rotations acting on the spin of the individual quarks . in particular , the instant - form wave function is constructed as a product of a momentum wave function which is spherically symmetric and invariant under permutations , and a spin - isospin wave function which is uniquely determined by su(6 ) symmetry requirements . by applying the melosh rotations , the pauli spinors of the quarks in the nucleon rest frame are converted to light - cone spinors .",
    "the relativistic spin effects are evident in the presence of spin - flip terms in the melosh rotations which generate non - zero orbital angular momentum components and non - trivial correlations between spin and transverse momentum of the quarks . on the other hand",
    ", the momentum - dependent wave function keeps the original functional form , with instant - form coordinates rewritten in terms of light - cone coordinates .",
    "the explicit expressions of the light - cone amplitudes within this cqm can be found in ref.@xcite , while the corresponding results for gpds in impact - parameter space and for tmds will be discussed in sect . 2 and 3 , respectively . finally , in sect .",
    "4 we will show predictions for single spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) due to t - even tmds .",
    "in light cone gauge @xmath2 , gpds are obtained from the same quark correlation function entering the definition of the ordinary parton distributions , but now evaluated between hadron with different momentum in the initial and final state .",
    "they depend on the average longitudinal - momentum fraction @xmath3 , the skewness parameter @xmath4 describing the longitudinal change of the nucleon momentum , and the momentum transfer @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 and @xmath7 , by a two - dimensional fourier transform to impact - parameter space gpds can be interpreted as densities of quarks with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 and transverse location @xmath8 with respect to the nucleon center of momentum .",
    "depending on the polarization of both the active quark and the parent nucleon , one defines@xcite three - dimensional densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 representing the probability to find a quark with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 and transverse position @xmath8 either with light - cone helicity @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) or transverse spin @xmath13 in the nucleon with longitudinal polarization @xmath14 ( @xmath12 ) or transverse spin @xmath15 .",

    "( [ eq : transv ] ) one may distinguish the three contributions corresponding to monopole , dipole and quadrupole structures .",
    "the unpolarized quark density @xmath28 in the monopole structure is modified by the chiral - odd terms with @xmath23 and @xmath29 when both the quark and the proton are transversely polarized .",

    "the quadrupole term with @xmath31 is present only when both quark and proton are transversely polarized . in terms of overlap of light - cone amplitudes ,",
    "the monopole distributions are associated to gpds which are diagonal in the orbital angular momentum space , while the dipole distributions describe spin flip either of the nucleon or of the quark , and accordingly are given by overlap of light - cone amplitudes which differ by one unit of orbital angular momentum in the initial and final state . in the case of the chiral - odd gpd @xmath25 the nucleon helicity flips in the direction opposite to the quark helicity , with a mismatch of orbital angular momentum of two units between the initial and final state .    in the following ,",
    "we show some examples of spin densities using the model predictions for the gpds from refs.@xcite . in the case of transversely polarized quarks in an unpolarized proton the dipole contribution introduces a large distortion perpendicular to both the quark spin and the momentum of the proton , as shown in the left column of fig .",
    "this effect has been related@xcite to a non - vanishing boer - mulders function@xcite @xmath32 which describes the correlation between intrinsic transverse momentum and transverse spin of quarks .",

    "the present results , with the opposite shift of up and down quark spin distributions imply an opposite sign of @xmath45 for up and down quarks@xcite as confirmed by the recent observation of the hermes collaboration@xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] are also in qualitative agreement with those obtained in lattice calculations@xcite .    finally , we refer to@xcite for the light - cone cqm results of the densities with more complex spin - configurations with transverse polarization of both the quark as well as the proton .",

    "( [ dictionary ] ) are given in terms of the same combinations of light - cone amplitudes parametrizing the corresponding gpds at @xmath6 , but taken for different values of the transverse momenta of the quarks .",
    "in particular , tmds are diagonal in the momentum space of the three quarks and are unintegrated over the transverse momentum of the active quark . on the other side , gpds",
    "are integrated over the transverse momenta of all the three quarks , but with a finite transverse - momentum transfer between the quarks in the initial and final state .",
    "therefore , the possibility to establish a direct relationship between tmds and gpds exists only in the kinematical limits where the differences in the momentum dependence of the light - cone amplitudes vanish .",
    "this is trivially the case when both the tmds and the gpds reduce to the ordinary quark distribution functions , i.e. @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the unpolarized , helicity and transversity quark distributions , respectively . moreover , within the light - cone cqm we find the following non - trivial relation @xmath76 a similar relation holds also within the diquark spectator model@xcite , with a factor 3 instead of 2 .",
    "the difference in the two model calculations supports the conclusions of ref.@xcite that the relationship between @xmath77 and @xmath25 can not be established in a model - independent way , even when we restrict ourselves to the simplest situation with only valence quark contribution .",
    "furthermore , in the present light - cone quark model one can write down relations also among tmds .",
    "although in qcd the various tmds are all independent of each other and describe different aspects of the nucleon structure , it is quite natural to encounter such relations in simple models limited to the valence - quark contribution . for a more detailed discussion on this point ,",
    "we refer to@xcite .    finally , in fig .",

    "they are defined as the integrals in @xmath81 of the tmds multiplied by @xmath82 . while the functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are dominated by the contribution due to p - wave interference , in the case of @xmath80 the contribution from the d wave",
    "is amplified through the interference with the s wave .",
    "the total results for up and down quarks obey the su(6 ) isospin relation , i.e. the functions for up quarks are four times larger than for down quark and with opposite sign .",
    "this does not apply to the partial - wave contributions , as it is evident in particular for the terms containing d - wave contributions .",
    "in ref.@xcite the present results for the t - even tmds were applied to estimate azimuthal asymmetries in sidis , discussing the range of applicability of the model , especially with regard to the scale dependence of the observables and the transverse - momentum dependence of the distributions . here",
