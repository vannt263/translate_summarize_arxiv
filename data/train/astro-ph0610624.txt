    "the census of supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) is large enough to probe the links between mass of sbhs and the global properties of the host galaxies ( see ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "however , accurate measurements of sbh masses ( @xmath3 ) are available for a few tens of galaxies and the addition of new determinations is highly desirable .    to this purpose",
    "we started a project aimed at measuring upper limits on @xmath3 in the center of all the nearby galaxies ( @xmath0 mpc ) for which stis / g750 m spectra are available in the hst archive .",
    "we retrieved data for 213 galaxies spanning over all the morphological types .",
    "this will extend previous works by sarzi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and verdoes kleijn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "we analyze a subsample of 22 galaxies .",
    "they have been selected to be s0-sb within 20 mpc and to have a measured stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "all the galaxies were observed as part of the hst / sunns project ( pi : h .- w .",
    "rix , go-7361 ) , except for ngc 4435 ( coccato et al .",
    "the stis / g750 m spectra were obtained with the @xmath5 slit crossing either the galaxy nucleus along a random position angle ( sunns ) or along the galaxy major axis ( ngc 4435 ) .",
    "the observed spectral region includes the [ n  ii]@xmath6 , h@xmath1 , and [ s  ii]@xmath7  emission lines .",
    "data reduction was performed with the stis pipeline , which we implemented to clean cosmic rays and hot pixels . for each galaxy we obtained the nuclear spectrum by extracting a @xmath8-wide ( @xmath9 pc ) aperture centered on the continuum peak .",
    "the ionized - gas velocity dispersion was measured by the fitting gaussians with the same width and velocity to the narrow component of the [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] emission lines .",
    "the h@xmath1 line and broad components were fitted with additional gaussians .",
    "we assumed that the ionized gas resides in a thin disk and moves onto circular orbits .",
    "the local circular velocity is dictated by the gravitational influence of the putative sbh . to derive the upper limits on @xmath3 we first built the gaseous velocity field and projected it onto the sky plane according to the disk orientation .",
    "then we observed it by simulating the actual setup of stis and effects related to the stis psf , slit width and the charge bleeding as done by coccato et al .",
    "including the mass of the stellar component would lead to tighter upper limits on @xmath3 .",
    "we have no information on the orientation of the gaseous disk within the central aperture . for this pilot project",
    "we assumed that the disk is either nearly face on ( @xmath10 ) or edge on ( @xmath11 ) and the slit is placed along its major axis .",
    "we derived the intrinsic flux radial profile of the gaseous disk by fitting a gaussian function to the narrow emission - line fluxes taking into account of disk inclination and stis psf .",
    "the resulting upper limits are consistent with those derived by sarzi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the sunns galaxy sample and by coccato et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for ngc  4435 .",
    "therefore , we are confident to obtain reliable estimates of the upper limit on @xmath3 for all the sample galaxies with emission lines in their spectra",
    ". this will allow to increase the statistical significance of the relationships between @xmath3 and galaxy properties and identify peculiar objects worthy of further investigations .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath3 of ngc  3351 , ngc  4314 , and ngc  4143 , which lie below the @xmath12 relation ( fig .",
    "1 ) .     upper limits ( filled circles ) and the @xmath12 relation .",
    "the edges of the arrows correspond to upper limits obtained with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the open circles show the galaxies with accurate measurements of @xmath3 ( ferrarese & ford 2005).,height=264 ]"
