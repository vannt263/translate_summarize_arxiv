    "also , the metric @xmath14 satisfies the einstein condition with negative einstein constant , which we normalize so that @xmath15 we will assume throughout that the compactified metric @xmath12 is at least @xmath16 up to the boundary .",
    "this compactification defines a conformal class of metrics on the boundary @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is called the _",
    "conformal infinity _ of @xmath19 .",
    "the basic example is the poincar model for hyperbolic space on the unit ball @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the conformal infinity is the standard conformal structure on the round sphere @xmath21 .",
    "conversely , given a conformal class of metrics on the boundary @xmath22 one can ask whether the interior admits a poincar - einstein metric whose conformal infinity is the given conformal class .",
    "although there is no general existence theory for this problem , a seminal result was proved by graham - lee @xcite : given a metric @xmath23 sufficiently close to the round metric @xmath24 on the sphere @xmath21 , there is a poincar - einstein metric @xmath14 on the ball @xmath25 whose conformal infinity is @xmath26 $ ] . in @xcite ,",
    "witten remarks that `` ... one might ask what is the significance of the fact that the graham - lee theorem presumably fails for conformal structures that are sufficiently far from the round one '' ( see page 263 ) .",
    "although witten s interest is mainly in a yang - mills analog , he points out the consequences of the fact that restricting to small neighborhood of the round metric implies that the scalar curvature is positive .",
    "he also remarks that the graham - lee result is likely optimal ; i.e. , `` the restriction to conformal structures that are sufficiently close to the standard one is probably also necessary for most values of ( the dimension ) '' and suggests a possible approach to finding a counterexample by `` ... using a family of @xmath27 s that can not be extended to a family of @xmath28 s '' ( see the footnote at the bottom of page 260 in @xcite for more details in the yang - mills context ) .    our main result in this note to prove the existence of infinitely many conformal classes on the seven - dimensional sphere @xmath0 which can not be the conformal infinity of a poincar - einstein metric on the ball @xmath1 , thus confirming witten s intuition in this dimension .",

    "the precise statement is :    [ mainintro ] there are infinitely many components of @xmath29 containing metrics whose conformal class can not be the conformal infinity of a poincar - einstein metric on the eight - dimensional ball @xmath1 .    the construction of gromov - lawson can be extended to dimensions @xmath30 , for all @xmath31 , and thus we expect theorem [ mainintro ] to hold in these cases as well ( see the remark at the end of section [ corsec ] ) .",
    "however , we only provide a detailed proof for dimension seven .",
    "our proof also relies on the fact , first observed by j. qing @xcite , that if the yamabe invariant of the conformal infinity of a poincar - einstein manifold is positive , then the yamabe invariant ( suitably defined ) of the compactified manifold is positive ( see section [ corsec ] ) . in section [ secmainthm ]",

    "since we will be using various facts about the yamabe problem , our notational convention will differ from most papers on the subject of poincar - einstein manifolds : that is , our p - e manifold will be @xmath3-dimensional , @xmath32 , and the boundary will have dimension @xmath33",

    "since @xmath249 and @xmath250 in @xmath136 , we can easily estimate @xmath251 to estimate @xmath252 , we will split the integral over @xmath1 into two parts : an integral over a collar neighborhood of the boundary , and an integral over the complement .",
    "the key point is that on the former set , the integrals will be small while on the latter set @xmath211 is conformal to @xmath12 .",
    "it will simplify our estimates if we define the collar neighborhoods in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath253 on @xmath1 , it follows that distances measured between points in @xmath254 with respect to @xmath171 and @xmath12 are comparable .",

    "recall that near @xmath163 , @xmath121 is defined to be constant on normal geodesics .",

    ", we obtain @xmath281    it follows from ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) that @xmath282 since @xmath238 converges in @xmath209 to a non - zero function , we see that @xmath216 has a positive , uniform lower bound for large @xmath228 . in particular , this implies that @xmath211 is conformal to a metric of positive scalar curvature , a contradiction .",
