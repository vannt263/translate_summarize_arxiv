    "the component stars of massive interacting binaries experience profound transformations over their lifetimes .",
    "their evolutionary stages are defined by how mass and angular momentum are shared and lost during the mass transfer stages @xcite .",
    "the originally more massive star grows faster and upon reaching a size comparable to its roche lobe begins mass and angular momentum transfer to the mass gainer companion .",
    "the orbit shrinks until the mass ratio reverses , but mass transfer will continue with an expanding orbit as long as the donor grows in proportion .",
    "the result will be a donor that is stripped of most of its outer envelope and a gainer that now appears rejuvenated by mass transfer @xcite .",
    "mass transfer may also cause the gainer to spin up to a rotational speed close to the critical value where centripetal and gravitational accelerations are equal at the equator @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that these mass gainer stars may include some of the rapidly rotating , classical be stars , b - type stars that display emission lines formed in outflowing , circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "there is now a substantial body of evidence that the supports the idea that some be stars were spun up by mass transfer in interacting binaries .",
    "most of the known massive x - ray binaries consist of a be star and neutron star companion , the remains of the former donor star @xcite .",
    "donor stars that end up with a mass lower than the chandrasekhar limit will probably avoid a supernova explosion , but will appear first as a hot subdwarf star and then eventually as a massive white dwarf . although there are no known examples of be plus white dwarf binaries , there are a few identified cases of be plus hot subdwarf binaries .",
    "the first discovery of the spectrum of a subdwarf companion was made from the analysis of uv spectra from the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _",
    "spacecraft @xcite and the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite of the well - known be star @xmath6  persei .",
    "the hot companion in is an object of solar mass and radius but with an effective temperature of @xmath7  kk .",
    "however , the hot subdwarf is much fainter than the be star , and its presence is perhaps best observed through its heating effects on the disk gas nearest to the subdwarf @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the binary 59  cygni shows many of the same characteristics found in @xmath6  per and is probably the second example of a be plus hot subdwarf system . a third candidate , @xcite",
    ", may also belong this category @xcite but at the present the evidence is not compelling .",
    "the fact that the nature of the companions in @xmath6  per and were only discovered after a century of spectroscopic observation , however , highlights the difficulties of their detection @xcite .",
    "here we report on the identification of a hot subdwarf companion in the be binary ( hr 2855 , hd 58978 ) .",
    "balmer emission lines in the be star primary in this system ( b0.5  ivnpe , @xcite ;",
    "b0.5  i ve , @xcite ) were first discovered by @xcite .",
    "although at first glance it appears to be a classical be star , it has historically displayed much more spectroscopic variability in its optical and uv spectrum than is typical for be stars @xcite .",
    "some of the first _ iue _ observations of fy  cma showed evidence of sharp , red - shifted , `` shell '' spectral lines that varied significantly on a timescale of days @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the time scales of variability indicated a binary origin .",
    "spectroscopic variability with a period of 37.26  d was subsequently found by @xcite who showed that the strength and profile of the @xmath8 wind line fluctuates with this period .",
    "@xcite also presented observations of the h@xmath4 and @xmath9 emission lines that suggested that they also varied in radial velocity and strength in much the same way as observed in @xmath6  per and 59  cyg , and suggested that fy  cma might be generically similar to these systems . however",
    ", @xcite could not confirm binarity as the orbital elements and the nature of the companion remained unknown .",
    "below we present an investigation of fy  cma that is based upon a re - examination of the _ iue _ spectra and an analysis of a large collection of optical spectra obtained between 1985 and 2006 (  2 ) .",
    "we first discuss the use of cross - correlation measurements of the _ iue _ spectra to obtain radial velocities for both components and to derive the orbital elements (  3 ) .",
    "we then use the orbital velocity curves to reconstruct the individual uv spectra of the components using a doppler tomography algorithm , and we compare the reconstructed spectra to models to estimate basic stellar properties (  4 ) .",
    "we then describe the orbital and temporal variations we find in the h@xmath4 and @xmath9 emission lines (  5 ) .",
    "we argue in  6 that the emission line variations are probably due to heating of the part of the disk rim that faces the hot subdwarf companion .",
    "we also discuss the long - term and phase - dependent variability in the strength and velocity of the shell - type infall lines that were discovered in the mid-1980s and suggest two possible mechanisms for their formation .",
    "finally , we show that phase - dependent profile , strength , and velocity variability in the wind lines suggest that the subdwarf s wind is n - enhanced and that there is a significant interaction between the subdwarf s wind and the disk of the be star .",
    "ninety - seven high resolution fuv spectra were obtained with _ iue _ over the period from 1979 to 1995 .",
    "the spectra were secured with the short wavelength prime ( swp ) camera in echelle mode , and the extracted and flux calibrated spectra from the final archive were downloaded from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute .",
    "we binned each spectrum onto a uniform @xmath10 wavelength grid ( bin size equivalent to 10 km  s@xmath11 ) , aligned them with a global average using cross ",
    "correlation shifts from the vicinity of strong interstellar lines ( after which the interstellar lines are removed by interpolation ) , and then rectified the fluxes by a spline fit to a series of pseudo - continuum zones . we discuss the radial velocity measurements and the appearance of the uv spectra in the next two sections .",
    "we also obtained 158 red spectra of fy  cma with the kitt peak national observatory 0.9  m coud feed telescope between 1985 and 2006 .",
    "the various observing runs are summarized in table  1 that lists the heliocentric julian dates of observation , besselian year range , wavelength range , spectral resolving power , number of individual spectra obtained , and a summary of the instrumental configuration .",
    "the spectra all record the h@xmath4 @xmath12 emission line and all but six also record the @xmath5 feature .",
    "all the spectra were made with the long collimator , camera 5 , and either grating a ( 632 grooves mm@xmath11 ) or grating b ( 312 grooves mm@xmath11 ) in second order",
    ". the ccd detector of choice changed over the years as better instruments became available , and these are listed in the final column using their standard kpno designations .",
    "most of the spectra are well exposed and have a s / n of 200 or better in the continuum .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in iraf .",
    "all the spectra were rectified to a unit continuum by fitting line - free regions with a low - order polynomial . during most of the runs from 2000 to 2006 , we also observed a number of rapidly rotating a - type stars ( primarily @xmath13  aql ) for the removal of atmospheric telluric lines from the target spectra .",
    "we created a library of atmospheric spectra for each run by removing the broad stellar features , and then we divided each target spectrum by the modified atmospheric spectrum that most closely matched the target spectrum in a selected region dominated by atmospheric absorptions .",
    "the spectra from runs before 2000 were transformed to the wavelength grid for the fourth to last run listed in table  1 and then were corrected for telluric absorption using the atmospheric spectra from that run ( sometimes with less than optimal results because of differences in spectral resolution ) .",
    "the spectra from each run were then transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid .",
    "measurements of these red spectra are presented in  5 .",
    "the first detection of the uv spectrum of the hot subdwarf in @xmath6  per was based upon _ iue _",
    "spectra that recorded many lines of high excitation transitions especially in the 1310  1385   range @xcite .",
    "thus , we began our search for evidence of a hot companion by calculating cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) of each spectrum with a template spectrum within this restricted wavelength range ( where the lines of the primary are relatively broad and weak ) .",
    "we formed the template spectrum from the synthetic spectral atlas associated with the non - lte , line - blanketed models of @xcite that were rebinned to the _ iue _ wavelength grid .",
    "we selected a solar abundance model with @xmath14  kk and @xmath15 for the template ( close to the optimal values ;  4 ) .",
    "the resulting ccfs immediately revealed a narrow but weak signal that displayed a coherent doppler shift when plotted against the orbital period from @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we then made gaussian fits of these ccfs to determine the radial velocity shifts for 50 of the 97 spectra where the ccf signal was clearly visible .",
    "we used the method of @xcite to estimate errors in the ccf velocities , and these range from 7 to 20 km  s@xmath11 depending on the s / n ratio of the spectrum .",
    "we also measured ccf radial velocities for the be star primary using two spectral regions where its photospheric lines are particularly strong ( 1423  1523 and 1570  1800  ) . in this case",
    "we used a template spectrum derived from the models of @xcite for @xmath16  kk and @xmath17 , first guesses based upon calibrations for the star s spectral classification .",
    "the resulting ccfs are broad because of the star s large projected rotational velocity , and instead of fitting these with a gaussian , we determined the radial velocity shifts relative to the average ccf . according to the method of @xcite , the errors in the ccf velocities for the be star are about 3  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "we then added the gaussian - fitted radial velocity of the average ccf ( @xmath18 km  s@xmath11 ) to each of these relative velocities to end up with the primary star velocities listed in table  2 .",
    "this table lists the heliocentric julian and ut dates of mid - exposure , the _ iue _ image number for the spectrum , the orbital phase ( see below ) , and the radial velocities @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the be star ( subscript 1 ) and the hot subdwarf ( subscript 2 ) , respectively . also given with the same subscripts are the observed minus calculated residuals @xmath21 from the orbital fits ( see table  3 ) , and we see that in general the deviations from the fit are comparable to the error estimates and to the scatter between measurements of pairs of spectra obtained close in time .",
    "we made a period search of the two sets of velocities using the discrete fourier transform methods of @xcite , and this analysis confirmed the period found by @xcite .",
    "we then used the non - linear , least - squares program of @xcite to determine independent orbital elements for the primary and secondary .",
    "these produced consistent results for the orbital period and epoch , and we adopted the period and epoch from the larger amplitude secondary that had significantly lower errors .",
    "we found that elliptical solutions did not yield any significant improvement in the residuals to the fits , so we assumed that the orbit is circular .",
    "our final orbital elements are presented in column 3 of table  3 and the radial velocity curves are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "table  3 lists period , @xmath22 , epoch of the superior conjunction of the be star , @xmath23 ( defining orbital phase 0.0 ) , semiamplitudes , @xmath24 , and systemic velocities , @xmath25 , for both components , mass ratio , @xmath26 , mass  inclination functions , @xmath27 , projected semimajor axis , @xmath28 , and r.m.s .",
    "residuals for each fit ( where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the orbits of the be and subdwarf star , respectively )",
    "we used the doppler tomography algorithm described by @xcite to reconstruct the individual primary and secondary spectra from the composite _ iue _ spectra .",
    "we took the radial velocity shifts for each component from the orbital solutions in table  3 , and then the reconstruction was run for 50 iterations with a gain of 0.8 ( the results are insensitive to these values ) .",
    "the flux ratio required for the reconstruction was determined from the secondary s line depths after making a comparison of the secondary s spectral properties with those in model spectra .",
    "we began our comparison of the reconstructed secondary spectrum and model spectra from @xcite by considering the appropriate line broadening .",
    "we selected several strong and minimally blended metallic lines to compare with a grid of synthetic profiles formed by convolution with a rotational broadening function for a linear limb darkening law @xcite and a range in assumed projected rotational velocity @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting mean of @xmath30 km  s@xmath11 indicates that the secondary s lines are narrow and only barely resolved in the _ iue _ spectra .",
    "we then experimented with a range of model effective temperatures and gravities to try to reproduce the relative patterns of line strength ( especially in the region surrounding the weak @xmath31 feature ) .",
    "we also compared the reconstructed and model profiles of the stark broadened @xmath32 feature to help estimate the appropriate value of gravity @xmath33 .",
    "the parameters for the best matching solar abundance model spectrum are listed in column 3 of table  4 .",
    "we then estimated the mean uv flux ratio to be @xmath34 based upon a comparison of the line strengths in the best match model and in the reconstructed secondary spectrum for a range in test values of flux ratio .",
    "we show in figures 3 and 4 the good agreement between the reconstructed secondary and model spectra for two regions of the uv spectrum that contain a number of prominent and photospheric lines .",
    "we also explored the range in synthetic spectral matches that were consistent with the appearance of the reconstructed be star spectrum .",
    "once again we compared the profile widths of several conspicuous absorption lines with models for a range in projected rotational velocity , and we found a mean value of @xmath35 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this estimate is similar to the result from @xcite , 375 km  s@xmath11 , but it is larger than those reported in other optical studies ( 280 km  s@xmath11 , @xcite ; 155 km  s@xmath11 , @xcite ) .",
    "we suspect that the optical lines may at times appear narrower because of unrecognized shell components formed in the be star s disk .",
    "we estimated the best match effective temperature based on the metallic line strengths ( avoiding the use of narrow features like @xmath31 that are probably partially formed in the disk ;  6 ) , and the best match model has a temperature consistent with the star s spectral classification ( table  4 ) .",
    "we simply assumed the gravity for the be star based on its luminosity class since there are no easily made gravity estimates from the uv photospheric lines .",
    "we note that both the temperature and the gravity agree well with estimates made by @xcite based upon the continuum colors and the profiles of h@xmath25 and h@xmath36 .",
    "fy  cma is not a known eclipsing binary , so we can not directly determine the system inclination and masses .",
    "however , the appearance of shell lines in the uv and optical spectra suggests that the inclination is probably large , @xmath37 @xcite , if the disk resides in the orbital plane .",
    "the typical mass for a b0.5  v star is @xmath38 @xcite , and from the value of @xmath39 in table  3 , this would imply that the inclination could be as small as @xmath40 .",
    "the range in probable masses is given in table  4 .",
    "we can estimate the radius of the be star primary from its visual magnitude @xmath41 and its parallax @xmath42 as measured by _ hipparcos _ @xcite . adopting @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 , @xmath46 mas , and a bolometric correction of @xmath47 @xcite ,",
    "then the radius from the luminosity and adopted temperature is @xmath48 , where we have ignored the minor flux contributions from the disk and subdwarf .",
    "the radius of the subdwarf then follows from the observed and model uv flux ratios , @xmath49 . these mass and radius estimates yield gravities that are similar within errors to those from spectroscopic considerations .",
    "the h@xmath4 feature in our spectra always appeared as a strong emission line indicating that the be disk was present throughout the period 1985  2006 .",
    "we show in figure  5 a montage of all the h@xmath4 profiles arranged according to orbital phase .",
    "the profile is often double - peaked , usually in the sense that the red peak is stronger around phase @xmath50 while the blue peak is stronger near phase @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the observations appear to confirm the suggestion by @xcite that the variations are orbitally modulated . on the other hand , our spectra",
    "also show that there are temporal variations present unrelated to orbital phase that appear as alternating bright and dark horizontal segments in the gray - scale representation .",
    "we measured the h@xmath4 equivalent widths by making a numerical integration of the line flux over the interval from 6528 to 6599   ( a region including weak emission components of @xmath52 ) , and these are listed in table  5 .",
    "the typical equivalent width measurement error is 0.04  .",
    "we find that there are significant variations in line strength over time scales of a week or so that appear to be unrelated to orbital phase and that probably reflect changes in the disk density distribution .",
    "the outer wings of h@xmath4 show a hint of an `` s''-shaped velocity variation that is similar to the orbital velocity curve of the be star .",
    "since the outer parts of the profile are formed in the disk gas closest to the star , the line wings may share in the orbital motion of the underlying star .",
    "we measured the bisector position of the emission line wings near the 25% maximum flux level using the method of @xcite , and these wing velocities are listed in column 4 of table  5 and are plotted together with the uv ccf velocities in figure  2 .",
    "the typical error for the radial velocities from the h@xmath4 wings is 1.0 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the h@xmath4 wing velocities indeed follow the orbital motion of the be star , and the orbital elements based upon them are in substantial agreement with those from the uv ccfs ( see column 2 of table 2 ) .",
    "the differences in systemic velocity @xmath25 are not significant given the asymmetries and line blending present in the h@xmath4 profile .",
    "we show the dramatic variations of the @xmath5 profile with orbital phase in figure  6 . here",
    "the emission displays a backwards `` s''-shaped velocity variation that is similar to the secondary s orbital velocity curve .",
    "the emission is strongest around orbital phase 0.0 when the hot subdwarf is in the foreground .",
    "the emission sometimes assumes a pronounced double - peaked shape , especially when the emission is relatively strong . in the same way as h@xmath4 , the line also displays non - orbital related variations that give a banded appearance to the gray - scale representation of the variations .",
    "we also see the occasional development of a central shell absorption feature at phases prior to superior conjunction of the be star .",
    "we made simple measurements of the peak velocity positions by locating the maximum flux positions in the profile .",
    "if two peaks were present and clearly separated by a local minimum , then we measured both peaks and recorded their mean position @xmath53 and their separation @xmath54 . if only one peak was visible , then only @xmath53 was measured .",
    "these measurements are given in the final two columns of table  5 for all those cases where at least one strong peak was visible .",
    "they are also plotted in figure  7 together with the orbital velocity curve of the hot subdwarf .",
    "we see that the velocity amplitude of the emission is actually larger than that of the subdwarf and that the episodes of greatest peak separation occur just prior to the orbital conjunctions .",
    "we show in the next section that these characteristics are consistent with an emission origin in the outer part of the disk that faces the subdwarf .",
    "our spectroscopic results provide the ingredients to estimate the basic elements of the system geometry . here",
    "we discuss the system dimensions and the evidence that the hot subdwarf is implicated in local heating of the be star s disk in much the same way as was found for @xmath6  per by @xcite and @xcite and for 59  cyg by @xcite .",
    "we present in figure  8 a sketch of the inferred system geometry as viewed from above the orbital plane . for the purpose of this illustration , we assume an orbital inclination of @xmath55 and a semimajor axis of @xmath56 ( where the acceptable range is probably @xmath57 for @xmath58 ) .",
    "we also adopt a be star radius of @xmath59 ( where the probable range is @xmath60 for distances of @xmath61  pc ) .",
    "the be star is represented by the solid disk on the left while the hot subdwarf is shown by the small dot on the right .",
    "the double - lobe surrounding them shows the much larger roche surface boundary .",
    "we can estimate the half light radius of the h@xmath4 emitting disk using the method described by @xcite .",
    "this estimate is derived from a simple density power law for the disk , the mean equivalent width ( @xmath62  ) , the adopted be star temperature and disk inclination , and an assumed disk outer boundary equal to the volume - equivalent , roche radius .",
    "these parameters lead to an estimated disk to star radius ratio of @xmath63 , or a half - light emitting radius of @xmath64 for the adopted radius of the be star .",
    "we caution that the simplicity of the models may lead to errors in the half - light radius of @xmath65 and that the models assume an azimuthal symmetry for the emission flux , which is probably not the case for the disk emission of fy  cma ( see below ) .",
    "nevertheless , this simple estimate of disk radius is indicated by the lighter gray shaded region on the left side of figure  8 .",
    "@xcite argue that the disks of be stars in binaries with nearly circular orbits are truncated at the 3:1 orbital resonance radius , and this occurs at a distance from the be star of @xmath66 that is only slightly larger than our disk half - light radius estimate .",
    "we showed in  5 that the @xmath5 emission has an orbital modulation that leads to greatest emission strength when the hot subdwarf is in the foreground .",
    "furthermore we found that the semiamplitude of the orbital doppler shift of the emission peaks was larger than that of the subdwarf ( from fig .  7 , @xmath67 km  s@xmath11 @xmath68 km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that a significant fraction of the emission forms in the part of the disk near the subdwarf where the keplerian velocity of the disk gas is larger than the orbital velocity of the subdwarf . ignoring three - body effects",
    ", we can estimate the radius of the emission source by assuming both the disk gas and the subdwarf obey keplerian motion around the be star , @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "this radius is about @xmath71 larger than the half - light radius , which suggests that the emission forms mainly along the outer rim of a disk that may be extended towards the hot subdwarf ( see fig",
    "we suspect that this outer disk region is heated by the combined effects of the incident subdwarf radiation and the impact of the subdwarf s wind on the disk .",
    "we imagine that the rest of the disk also contributes to the line emission flux , and , for example , those times when weak emission is observed ( see fig .",
    "7 ) may correspond to episodes when the gas density declines in the outer rim facing the subdwarf and the flux from the rest of the disk dominates .    since the heated disk gas nearest the hot subdwarf will have a higher keplerian velocity , the center of the heated region will move ahead of the axis joining the stars by an amount that depends on the cooling and orbital timescales .",
    "we can estimate the phase offset @xmath72 of this asymmetry in two ways .",
    "first , the central heated region should reach inferior conjunction about midway between the observed velocity extrema at phases @xmath73 and 0.17 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , i.e. , at @xmath74 .",
    "second , the velocity peak separation is presumably caused by the heated region forming in a sector of a ring .",
    "we will observe the largest velocity separations when the mid - point of the ring segment is oriented along our line of sight . according to the peak separations plotted in figure  7",
    ", greatest peak separations occur around @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that the apex of the heated rim is offset by about 0.06 in phase ( @xmath77 ) ahead of the subdwarf inferior junction at @xmath78 . from simple geometric arguments",
    ", we expect that the maximum half - peak separation @xmath79 is related to the emission semiamplitude by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is half the ring sector opening angle .",
    "from the values of peak separation in table  5 , we estimate @xmath82 km  s@xmath11 and @xmath83 .",
    "these values were used to plot a representative heated region in the darker gray shaded area of figure  8 .",
    "the actual extent of the heated ring is probably larger than shown since the separated emission peaks actually sample a range of ring azimuthal angles and not just the termination angles .",
    "the subdwarf may also affect the kinematics of the gas motion in the disk rim .",
    "we show in figure  9 the orbital phase variations in the appearance of the lines near @xmath31 .",
    "the cores of these lines are shell - type features formed in the disk gas seen in projection against the photosphere of the be star .",
    "we see evidence that the shell feature broadens from @xmath84 to @xmath78 and apparently shifts from a redshifted to a blueshifted position at phases surrounding conjunction at @xmath78 .",
    "we imagine that the motion of the outer disk gas is influenced by subdwarf as the disk gas passes and overtakes the star .",
    "the gravitational attraction would cause acceleration and outward motion as the disk gas approaches the subdwarf , but the same forces would cause deceleration and inward motion following closest passage .",
    "thus , we would observe infalling ( redshifted ) disk gas before @xmath78 and then outward moving ( blueshifted ) gas after @xmath78 . on the other hand , the disk gas projected against the be star has more nearly keplerian and tangential motion at @xmath84 leading to the appearance of narrow shell lines at that phase .",
    "this kind of perturbation in the keplerian motions may also partially explain the appearance of a redshifted shell feature in the @xmath9 profiles near @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , an orientation where the disk gas projected against the be star would be infalling and relatively dense .",
    "in addition to the shell features discussed above that predominantly are formed in the disk , another circumstellar component is seen in some intermediately - ionized species ( e.g. , ) .",
    "these variable features , which rarely show velocities less than the photospheric value and can display velocities as large as 50  @xmath86 relative to the photosphere of the be star , were discovered in _ iue _",
    "images obtained in the 1980s @xcite and they clearly show the presence of significant infall of material toward the be star .",
    "often times these lines are asymmetric with enhanced absorption on the red side of the profile .",
    "@xcite identified six infall episodes that are best seen in the ( multiplet  34 ) line at 1895.456   , since the feature does not have to compete with a strong photospheric component and it is not blended with interstellar or other circumstellar lines .    from the entire set of 97 _ iue _ swp high resolution ( hires ) images that span more than 15 years of observation and our knowledge of the orbit of the system , we now have more insight on the nature of the infall lines .",
    "their behavior in strength and velocity are shown in figures  10 , 11 , and 12 .",
    "representative examples of the three basic types of observed features , photospheric , photospheric with additional absorption from the be star s disk , and infall are given in figure  10 . in order to eliminate phase - dependent effects ,",
    "we have chosen spectra taken at approximately the same quadrature phase on the _ trailing _ hemisphere of the be star but at different epochs .",
    "note that the central core of the profile taken during a period of enhanced disk absorption shows the same velocity as the photospheric line , but that the feature formed in infalling material has a significant redshift . in the upper two - part panel of figure  11",
    "we plot the residual intensity of the deepest part of the line and its radial velocity versus observation date .",
    "all data are included in the intensity plot , but in the velocity plot we use a different symbol for observations that show no , or minimal shell absorption .",
    "points that fall above the _ dashed _ horizontal line in the upper panel visually appeared to be mostly photospheric .",
    "the double horizontal _ dashed lines _ in the second panel delineate the domain of photospheric motion .",
    "features that fall above the double line are clearly associated with infall phases .",
    "seven or eight clear infall episodes are observed .",
    "the data suggest that the duration of the infall phases varies from days to a year , but significant data gaps from 1979 - 85 and 1990 - 94 render it impossible to determine a firm value or its degree of variability . an apparently extended infall phase of about 300 days was seen from hjd  24469192447215 . in the lower two panels of figure  11 ,",
    "the same data are plotted versus orbital phase . from the third panel",
    "it can be seen that on the average the shell - type absorption is enhanced in the phase interval 0.30.7 . but",
    "from the display in the fourth panel it is apparent that features seen around phase 0.5 tend to display the systemic velocity , implying they are formed in the disk of the be star . in the fourth panel",
    "core velocities from only the spectra showing enhanced shell absorption are compared with the radial velocity curve of the be star .",
    "it is clear that infall features with velocities up to 50  @xmath86 relative to the photosphere are seen _ at most phases _ with a minimal occurrence around phase 0.5 .",
    "the infall features tend to cluster around the quadrature points at which their velocities are highest relative to the be star s photosphere .",
    "many of the phase dependent strength and velocity variations discussed above can also be seen in the gray - scale plot presented in figure  12 .",
    "the episodic infall of material is fundamentally different from that observed in the algol - type binaries @xcite , where mass motion toward a mass gainer is typically seen only between phases 0.750.95 . in the case of fy  cma",
    ", the infall features predominantly cluster around the quadrature phases from 0.150.35 and 0.650.90 .",
    "the velocities of the shell features around phase 0.5 tend to be either photospheric or negative relative to the be star .",
    "@xcite discussed various scenarios to explain the observed simultaneous presence of infall and outflow features in this system including a sudden accretion event , the possible presence of magnetic loops , or flow from a polar jet .",
    "@xcite reported that infall components in the doublet were contemporaneously observed with those in @xmath87 and also suggested that magnetic loops might be involved , but the phase - dependence of the infall features does not support this speculation .",
    "the infall is more likely a consequence of an interaction between the wind from the subdwarf and the periphery of the massive disk of the be star or disk perturbations due to the tidal force produced by the subdwarf .",
    "the motion of a shock - interaction region would result from variations in the location of the interface where there is a balance between the dynamic pressure of the subdwarf s wind and the gas pressure at the periphery of the be star s disk .",
    "it is not clear at this time whether it is the subdwarf or the be star that might be driving the variability though .",
    "epochs when no enhanced shell absorption is observed would correspond to minimal wind - disk interaction . alternatively",
    "the episodic infall features could simply be a result of gas dynamics in the disk due to a tidal effect from the subdwarf .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the gas motion in a perturbed disk in a be / x - ray binary @xcite reveal turbulence in the outer disk and even the formation of spiral structure .",
    "similar disk variability could be operating in fy  cma .",
    "the details are probably complex but an interplay of such gravitationally related forces could create time variable and sometimes coherent gas flows . for example , the tidal deformation of the disk leads to an axial elongation that moves ahead of the motion binary .",
    "disk gas returning from the extended regions would be observed to be moving inwards when viewed at the quadrature phases .",
    "finally , we return to the cyclic variation in the @xmath88 wind line that first led @xcite to find the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the plot of these variations in figure  13 shows that the greatest extent of blueshifted absorption occurs around @xmath78 when the subdwarf is in the foreground .",
    "we note that such a strong wind feature is quite unusual for be stars @xcite , and the orbital phasing suggests instead that the feature may form through absorption of the be star s flux by the wind of the hot subdwarf when it is in the foreground .",
    "the profile would mainly be affected by blueshifted wind absorption since any redshifted absorption component would probably by canceled by redshifted emission in the subdwarf s wind .",
    "this kind of orbital wind variation is not seen in the other major wind line , the @xmath89 doublet , and this may suggest that the subdwarf is n - enriched and c - depleted as expected for a star that has been stripped down to near the cno - burning core .",
    "one problem with this explanation is that the largest wind speeds observed , @xmath90 km  s@xmath11 , are much smaller than the wind terminal velocity of a few thousand km  s@xmath11 expected for a radiatively driven wind from the subdwarf @xcite .",
    "however , it may be that the wind optical depths are too small for absorption to occur at higher outflow velocities .    in 1995 march a sequence of daily _ iue _ swp hires spectra of fy  cma were obtained over the course of 16 days .",
    "fortuitously these spectra were centered in time around orbital phase 0.0 and extended from phases 0.784 to 0.213 .",
    "the temporal variations in the @xmath88 doublet are illustrated in a gray - scale diagram in figure  14 .",
    "more detail can be seen from the plot of selected observations shown in figure  15 .",
    "the features initially showed very little structure until a core with the velocity of the center - of - mass of the system appeared around phase 0.97 .",
    "the core , still with no velocity shift , reached its greatest strength at conjunction .",
    "it broadened by phase 0.08 , and had completely vanished by phase 0.21 .",
    "the core is probably formed in a shock - heated region between the stars where the n - enhanced wind from the subdwarf collides with the disk of the be star .",
    "our work demonstrates that fy  cma represents the third known case of a be star with a hot subdwarf companion , the remains of an intense binary interaction that stripped down the mass donor to a tiny fraction of its original mass and left the mass gainer spinning rapidly .",
    "the subdwarf secondary in fy  cma has a mass that is close to the chandrasekhar limit , and lacking a significant h - envelope , it may represent the progenitor of a supernova type sn  ibc .",
    "the system is now wide enough that it is unlikely that the be star will be substantially spun down by tidal effects , so its rapid rotation will be important throughout its subsequent evolution .",
    "such rapidly rotating massive stars may be related to the progenitors of collapsars and gamma - ray bursters @xcite .",
