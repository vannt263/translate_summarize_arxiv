    "in 1993 , camassa and holm derived the well - known camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 being an arbitrary constant ) with the aid of an asymptotic approximation to the hamiltonian of the green - naghdi equations . since the work of camassa and holm @xcite , more diverse studies on this equation have remarkably been developed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature of the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) is that it admits peakon solutions in the case @xmath6 .",
    "the stability and interaction of peakons were discussed in several references @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ch equation , other similar integrable models with peakon solutions were found @xcite .",
    "recently , there are two integrable peakon equations found with cubic nonlinearity .",
    "they are the following cubic equation @xcite @xmath7_x=0 , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{mch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the novikov s equation @xcite @xmath8 there is also much attention in studying integrable multi - component peakon equations .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors proposed a multi - component generalization of the ch equation , and in @xcite , multi - component extensions of the cubic nonlinear equation ( [ mch ] ) were studied .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose the following multi - component system @xmath9 , \\\\ n_{j",

    "this system is reduced to the standard ch equation ( [ ch ] ) as @xmath14 , @xmath15 and to the cubic nonlinear ch equation ( [ mch ] ) as @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , it is a kind of multi - component combination of the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) and the cubic nonlinear ch equation ( [ mch ] ) .",
    "the system ( [ meq ] ) contains an arbitrary function @xmath1 , thus it is actually a large class of multi - component equations .",
    "we remark that , very recently , li , liu and popowicz proposed a four - component peakon equation which also contains an arbitrary function @xcite .",
    "they derived the lax pair and infinite conservation laws for their four - component equation , and presented a bi - hamiltonian structure for their equation in the case that the arbitrary function is taken to be zero . in this paper , we show that the multi - component system ( [ meq ] ) admits lax representation and infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "due to the presence of the arbitrary function @xmath1 , we do not expect the system ( [ meq ] ) is bi - hamiltonian integrable system in general .",
    "however , we demonstrate that for some special choices of @xmath1 we may find the corresponding bi - hamiltonian structures . as examples ,",
    "we derive the peakon solutions of this system in the case @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we obtain a new integrable model which admits stationary peakon solutions .",
    "the whole paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the lax pair and conservation laws of equation ( [ meq ] ) are presented . in section 3 ,",
    "the hamiltonian structures and peakon solutions of equation ( [ meq ] ) in the case @xmath3 are discussed .",
    "some conclusions and open problems are addressed in section 4 .",
