    "it is known that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source . in particular , at large distances from the source , the radiation intensity is distributed over larger surfaces and therefore the intensity per unit area decreases as the distance from the surface to the source increases .    in this paper , we solve a problem in radiometry involving the inverse square law , see e.g. , @xcite[section 4.8.1 , formula ( 10 ) ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) .",
    "we begin explaining the concepts needed to pose the problem .",

    "@xmath2 denotes the spherical surface of radius one centered at the origin in @xmath3 .",
    "if we have a piece of surface @xmath4 , then the total amount of energy received at @xmath5 , or in other words the radiant flux through @xmath5 , is given by the surface integral @xmath6 the _ irradiance _ @xmath7 is the amount of energy or radiant flux incident on a surface per unit area ; it is measured in @xmath8 .",
    "we notice that in this case radiation flows perpendicularly through @xmath5 . if the piece of surface @xmath9 is dilated by @xmath10 with respect to the origin , then the new surface @xmath11 is contained in the sphere of radius @xmath10 centered at the origin",
    ". if there is no loss , then the radiant flux on @xmath5 and the radiant flux on @xmath11 must be the same .",
    "therefore , if @xmath11 has a larger area than @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath12 , the average amount of energy per unit area at @xmath11 must be smaller than the average amount of energy per unit area at @xmath5",
    ". likewise if @xmath13 , then the energy per unit area in @xmath11 gets larger .",
    "let @xmath14 be the radiant fluxes at @xmath5 and @xmath11 , respectively . as we said , by energy conservation @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 denotes the surface area of @xmath5 , we have that the irradiance in @xmath5 is @xmath17 , and the irradiance at @xmath11 is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore @xmath19 suppose we break the domain @xmath20 , with @xmath21 disjoint , and such that @xmath22 is approximately equal to a constant @xmath23 on @xmath21 .",
    "then the radiant flux @xmath24 received at @xmath5 satisfies @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radiant flux at @xmath21 .",
    "we have @xmath27 and the irradiance @xmath28 in @xmath21 is @xmath29 , and the irradiance @xmath30 in @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "so , as before , @xmath33 we then have that @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the irradiance over an infinitesimal patch over @xmath11 around the direction @xmath36 .",
    "now , instead of considering a patch of surface on @xmath11 , we look at a sufficiently smooth surface given parametrically by @xmath37 for @xmath36 on a piece of @xmath2 .",
    "we fix a unit direction @xmath38 , and take an infinitesimally small neighborhood of @xmath38 in @xmath2 , say @xmath39 .",

    "the tangent plane @xmath42 at @xmath43 has normal unit @xmath44 .",
    "the region on the tangent plane for @xmath45 is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "let us calculate the area of @xmath47 .",
    "notice @xmath41 and @xmath47 have approximately the same area .",
    "consider the plane @xmath48 perpendicular to the direction @xmath38 passing through @xmath43 , and denote by @xmath49 the region on that plane for @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "we have that @xmath51 therefore @xmath52 on the other hand , by similarity @xmath53 and we then obtain that @xmath54 the irradiance on the infinitesimal area @xmath41 then equals @xmath55 therefore , if we have a piece of surface @xmath56 in @xmath3 parameterized by a function @xmath37 for @xmath57 with @xmath9 , and we have radiant intensity @xmath0 for each @xmath58 , then based on the above considerations we introduce the following quantity , measuring the amount of irradiance at the patch of surface @xmath59 , by the surface integral@xmath60 where @xmath61 is the outer unit normal to the surface @xmath56 at the point @xmath37 .",
    "notice that if @xmath56 is far from the source , then @xmath62 is very large and therefore the irradiance on @xmath56 is very small .",
    "formula generalizes the inverse square law in radiometry from @xcite[section 4.8.1 , formula ( 10 ) ] .",
    "the problem we propose and solve in this paper is the following .",

    "suppose radiation emanates from the origin with radiant intensity @xmath0 in each direction @xmath58 .",
    "we want to find a reflector surface @xmath56 parameterized by @xmath37 for @xmath58 such that the radiation is reflected off by @xmath56 into the set @xmath64 and such that the irradiance received on each patch of @xmath64 has at least measure @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , we propose to find @xmath56 such that @xmath67 for each @xmath68 , where the set @xmath69 is the collection of directions @xmath58 that @xmath56 reflects off in @xmath7 .",
    "we ask the reflector to cover all the target @xmath64 , that is , @xmath70 . in particular ,",

    "we will also see that , in general , for each fixed point @xmath75 in the support of the measure @xmath63 , we construct a reflector that overshoots energy only at @xmath75 , that is , for each set @xmath76 such that @xmath77 we have equality in ; see theorems [ discretethmgeq][parts ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ] and theorem [ thm : solutionforgeneralmeasure ] . in subsections [",

    ".    to solve our problem , we introduce the notion of reflector and reflector measure with supporting ellipsoids of revolution , and show that makes sense in terms of lebesgue measurability , section [ sec : reflectorsandreflectormeasures ] . with this definition , reflectors are concave functions and therefore differentiable a.e .",
    ", so the normal @xmath78 exists a.e .. to obtain the @xmath56-additivity of the reflector measure given in proposition [ mumeasure ] , we need to assume that the target @xmath64 is contained in a hyperplane or @xmath64 is countable .",

    ", the reflected rays might cross the reflector to reach the target , in other words , the reflector might obstruct the target in certain directions .",
    "this physical issue can be avoided by assuming that the supporting ellipsoids used in the definition of reflector have the target contained in their interiors .",
    "another kind of physical obstruction might happen when the target obstructs the incident rays in their way to the reflector .",
    "all of these are discussed and illustrated in subsection [ subset : physicalvisibilityissues ] .    in section [ sec : ellipsoids ] , we show properties of ellipsoids of revolution that are needed in the proofs of our results . in section [ sec : soldis ] , the problem is first solved in the discrete case , that is , when the measure @xmath63 is concentrated on a finite target @xmath64 .",
