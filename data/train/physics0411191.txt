    "<S> there exist a route of bifurcation to a chaotic orbit and more attractors in a bifurcation diagram for the proportion of particle density to fluid density . along with the increase of spatial parameters in the flow filed , the bifurcation process is suspended , as well as more and more attractors emerge . in the motion of dilute particles , a drag term and gravity term dominate and result in the bifurcation phenomenon . </S>"
