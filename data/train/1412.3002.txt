    "t tauri stars ( ttss ) are precursors to solar - like stars and planetary systems . as such",
    ", their study is fundamental for the comprehension of solar system formation , evolution and planetary building up . around the earth location in the galaxy ,",
    "there is a ring of star forming regions which constitutes the main laboratory for the study of the early phases of solar system formation .",
    "regions like taurus , aurigae , lupus , chamaleon or ophiuchus are within a radius of 140 pc around the earth , in a clean area of the galaxy , where extinction is low .",
    "moreover , they are at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath0 ) minimising the pollution of uv surveys by background galaxies .",
    "these regions form mainly solar - like stars ( though b stars are observed in ophiuchus or a stars in aurigae ) . all together , they cover a large area in the sky , being the taurus - auriga complex the most extended , roughly 20x20 square degrees in the sky .",
    "the identification of ttss in these regions has proceeded at a fast rate . from the first observations of infrared excess and magnetically active stars in the neighbourhood of the molecular clouds ( see i.e. strom et al .",
    "1976 , herbig & bell , 1989 , lada 1983 ) to the late use of the large scale surveys of the galaxy ( neuhauser et al .",
    "1995 , wichmann et al .",
    "1996 , li & hu , 1998 , kohoutek & wehmeyer 1999 rebull et al .",
    "2011 , esplin et al .",
    "in all these works , lists of candidates have been compiled . to search for candidates",
    ", these investigations resourced to some of the ttss basic properties such as their proximity to the molecular clouds , the equivalent width of the h@xmath1 line , their proper motions and kinematics or their enhanced x - ray flux .",
    "final source identification resources usually to the optical to infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the cttss ; the accretion disk imprint is clearly apparent in the sed .",
    "however for wttss spectroscopic follow - up observations are adopted as the most reliable mean for source identification ; in particular , the strength of li  i absorption is _ the _ reliable tracer of youth ( see i.e. wichmann et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the search for candidates requires to understand the distinct nature of the ttss with respect to other galactic sources .",
    "ttss display excess emission in various wavelength ranges compared with their main sequence analogues .",
    "this excess is caused by the release of gravitational energy during the star formation process .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum during the gravitational collapse drives to the formation of accretion disks that channel the infall of matter onto the star .",
    "disks get heated by the dissipation of the angular momentum excess into the small scales through the action of the magneto rotational instability , according to the current paradigma .",
    "the magnetically mediated interaction between the slowly rotating pre - main sequence ( pms ) star and the disk drives to the production of jets and outflows ( see gmez de castro 2013a , for a recent review ) . as a result ,",
    "ttss display :    * an infrared to millimeter wavelengths excess caused either directly by the disk radiative output itself or through the disk reprocessing of the stellar and jet radiation ( see , for instance the first works as mendoza 1968 or the recent works as furlan et al .",
    "2011 or jensen et al . 2009 ) * an optical excess caused by the veiling continuum produced by plasma at a nominal temperature of about 7,000 - 10,000  k that represents the low energy tail of the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum ( see , for instance , the first works as basri & batalha 1990 or the recent works by ingleby et al .",
    "an ultraviolet ( uv ) excess produced by plasmas with electron temperatures ranging from 10,000  k to 50,000  k that shows both as a warm continuum and a distinct set of spectral indicators ; excess emission is observed in neutral species ( h  i , o  i , c  i ) , singly ionised species ( c  ii , si  ii , fe  ii , mg  ii , o  ii ) all the way to highly ionised species such as c  iv , n  v or o  vi , not to mention the h@xmath2 molecular emission in the werner bands .",
    "this excess is produced by the sheared magnetosphere - disk boundary layer and the magnetospheric accretion flow with a non - negligible contribution from the outflow and the inner disk ( see gmez de castro 2009 for a detailed review on the uv spectrum of the ttss ) .",
    "* an x - ray excess ( see , for instance , from the first works by montemerle et al .",
    "1983 to reviews such as preibish 2004 ) produced by the strong magnetospheric activity , the expanded corona and the accretion shocks at the point of impact , where the gravitational energy of the infalling material is finally released into heating ( _ i.e. _ lamzin 1998 , gullbring & calvet 1999 ) .    in spite of the relevance of the uv excess of the ttss compared to that of their main sequence analogues ,",
    "most of the searches for candidates have been run at either x - ray ( see , for instance , feigelson et al .",
    "2005 , neuhauser et al .",
    "1995 ) or infrared wavelengths ( furlan et al . 2011 , takita et al .",
    "2010 , padget et al .",
    "only the southern area of the taurus complex was surveyed to search for ttss in the uv ( findeisen & hillenbrand 2010 ; hereafter fh ) .",
    "the release of the galex all sky survey ( hereafter galex / ais ) has provided an amazing wealth of information on the uv characteristics of the galactic stellar population ( bianchi et al .",
    "2014 ) , in general , and of the gould s belt or the local supercomplex of star formation ( gmez de castro et al .",
    "2011 ) , in particular .",
    "among all the possible regions of star formation , the taurus - auriga complex is the prototype of low mass star formation and the best studied ( kenyon et al .",
    "the complex contains many dark nebulae , herbig - haro jets and outflows , and young stars . with few massive o or b stars ,",
    "the clouds are an excellent place to study the formation of sun - like stars , in contrast with the orion nebula cluster , at 450  pc , where a significant population of young massive stars resides .",
    "the galex / ais survey of the taurus - auriga molecular complex consists of 197 galex fields covering 380 square degrees in the sky ; more than 3 times larger than the fh survey .",
    "about 163,000 nuv sources have been detected allowing detailed studies of the stellar population in this area of the galaxy , as well as , searching for young stars .",
    "the area mapped by galex also includes the northern tip ( in galactic coordinates ) of the hyades stellar association .    in this work",
    ", we have developed a set of new criteria , different than those proposed by fh s , to search for ttss in uv surveys .",
    "our method makes use of the known spectral energy distribution of the ttss in the uv to derive , the uv magnitudes of the ttss in the galex bands .",
    "once the method is validated , we have used a combination of uv and ir colors to discriminate the ttss from the background stellar population .",
    "our working sample consists of 163,313 uv sources that have been cross - correlated with optical and ir catalogues to produce a number of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams . from that , a total of 63 new candidates to ttss have been found . in sect .  2 ,",
    "the photometric properties of the ttss in the galex bands are calculated . in sect .  3 ,",
    "the main characteristics of the galex survey are outlined ; the multi - band photometric criteria are defined and applied to the galex sample to produce a preliminary list of candidates . in the process , 31 known ttss within the area mapped by the galex - ais are retrieved . as a result ,",
    "a more robust data base is established to qualify the ttss candidates in the galex  ais survey .",
    "this data base is used in sect  4 to further refine the search and produce a final list of 63 new candidates , most of them class ii - iii sources ( wilking & lada 1983 ) .",
    "a short discussion on the sources location and a brief summary are provided in sect .  5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "galex was a 50-cm primary space telescope with a ritchey - chretien mounting feeding simultaneously two detectors sensitive to the near and far uv making use of a multilayer dichroic beamsplitter .",
    "the near uv or nuv channel works in the 1770 - 2730    spectral range and the far uv or fuv channel in the 1350 - 1780    range ; the transmittance curves of the channels are shown in fig .  1 , together with the uv spectrum of t  tau , the prototype of tts .",
    "the characteristics of the plasma sampled by the nuv and fuv bands are quite distinct :    * the spectrum of the ttss in the fuv band contains mainly emission lines covering a very broad range of plasma temperatures ; from the molecular bands of h@xmath2 ( herczeg et al .",
    "2002 , france et al .",
    "2011 ) to the resonance transitions of si  iv , c  iv , c  i and he  ii ( gmez de castro & franqueira 1997 , valenti et al 2000 , yang et al 2012 , gmez de castro & marcos - arenal 2012 , ardila et al .",
    "2013 , gmez de castro 2013 ) .",
    "the peak of the band is at 1500    hence , galex fuv band radiation is dominated by the fluorescence h@xmath2 radiation and the c  iv , he  ii and si  iv features .",
    "radiation in these lines correlates with accretion rate ( see , france et al . 2012 , ardila et al . 2013 and gmez de castro 2013b , for the most recent references in the field ) . in cool stars ,",
    "radiation in the galex fuv band correlates with the stellar activity , as measured by the h , k ca  ii index ( findeisen et al . , 2011 ) *",
    "the spectrum of the ttss in the nuv band contains mainly radiation from warm plasma at temperatures between 3000  k and some 10,000  k ; the dominant features being the mg  ii[uv1 ] multiplet , the fe  ii resonance multiplets [ uv1 ] , [ uv2 ] and [ uv3 ] , the c  ii ] feature at 2326     and the short wavelength tail of the balmer continuum .",
    "the transmittance curve of the band enhances the radiation from the fe  ii multiplets and the 2326    feature with respect to the mg  ii radiation , the strongest line in the nuv spectrum .",
    "for instance , in t  tau , 38% of the nuv radiation is in the c  ii]@xmath3 , mg  ii and fe  ii lines .",
    "both line radiation and continuum correlate with accretion rate and chromospheric activity .",
    "these trends are readily shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "in fig .  2 , the c  iv line excess radiation in the ttss is compared with that of main sequence cool stars , including the very active m - dwarfs ( from gmez de castro & marcos - arenal 2012 ) .",
    "as shown ttss are several orders of magnitude brighter , allowing to detect them at the 140 pc distance of the tmc . therefore , radiation in the fuv band can be used as reliably as h@xmath1 or x - ray radiation surveys to identify the ttss by their unusual strength . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the m@xmath4 versus uv - v color is plotted for simultaneous near uv and optical observations obtained with the iue of ttss ( gmez de castro 1997 ) .",
    "the location of the late type ( k3 or later ) ttss in the diagram is plotted against the location of cool main sequence stars .",
    "a quick inspection shows that the uv - v color decreases as the ttss approach the main sequence but that the color excess is negligible in the weak - lined ttss ( wttss ) .    to derive the expected photometric properties of the ttss in the galex bands , we have used the sample of the ttss observed with the iue in low dispersion mode and compiled by gmez de castro & franqueira 1997 for the iue uniform low dispersion archive guides ( hereafter gdcf ) ; only the 21 ttss with high snr spectra over the whole range",
    "have been selected for this purpose ( see table  1 ) .",
    "their iue spectra have been multiplied by the normalised galex transmittance function in the fuv and nuv windows to compute their fuv and nuv ab magnitudes using morrisey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) conversion : @xmath5 + @xmath6    this iue sample is scarce in terms of wttss and m - type cttss due to the sensitivity of the iue . also note that given the spectral energy distribution of the ttss , their fuv magnitude is rather low ( especially for wttss ) , as a result it is challenging to detect cool wttss in the galex fuv band ( see below ) .",
    "the baseline of the galex all sky survey was completed in 2007 .",
    "galex ais covers 26,000  deg@xmath7 ( @xmath8% of the sky ) and provides broadband imaging in two uv bands .",
    "galex obtained 197 images on the taurus molecular cloud for a total coverage of @xmath9 deg@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) ; note that the galex field of view is circular with radius 0.6@xmath10 .",
    "the galex mission provides as output products for each tile ( or image in the ais survey ) several files containing the pipeline processed images in the fuv and nuv bands , the intermediate calibration files and the catalogue of sources identified in each pointing ; the sources in the catalogue are identified with the sextractor procedure ( morrissey et al .",
    "2007 ) and their fuv and nuv magnitudes are provided . typically , the number of sources in the catalogue outnumbers by a factor of 2 - 3 , the number of sources that can be identified as such , from a simple inspection of the images .",
    "the detection procedure clearly suffers from overestimation of actual sources .",
    "the number of spurious detections is very large .    to overcome this problem",
    "we have designed a strategy that guarantees no ttss are lost in the cross - identification procedure .",
    "ttss are stars with photospheric spectral types f to m and an infrared excess that decreases as stars approach the main sequence . as an example , we display in fig .  5 , the spectral energy distribution of ak  sco located at 145  pc from the sun . the prominent fuv and infrared excesses",
    "are readily recognized over the stellar atmosphere radiative output predicted by the kurucz model of an f5 star ( alencar et al .",
    "thus , a cross - identification with galactic sources from the fourth usno ccd astrograph catalog - u.s . naval observatory ( ucac4 ; zacharias et al .",
    "2013 ) and the 2mass surveys ( strutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) is a reliable mean to remove spurious sources without loosing ttss in the procedure .",
    "_ bona fide _ galex sources have been identified by having a 2mass counterpart within a search radius of 3  arcsec .",
    "this search radius was carefully selected after a precise study of the shift between 2mass and galex sources in the tmc ( see gmez de castro et al 2011 , for details ) .",
    "after cross - match all sources satisfied @xmath11  mag what corresponds to the @xmath12 detection threshold for a typical exposure time of 100  s ( bianchi et al . 2013 ) .",
    "magnitude completeness limits for 2mass are 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 mag in j , h and k@xmath13 bands , respectively .",
    "these limits are well above the magnitude of m - type stars at the distance of the taurus - auriga molecular complex .",
    "the j absolute magnitude for a 4  myr old m5 star is @xmath14 ( e.g. siess et al .",
    "2000 ) . at a distance of 140 pc , the magnitude of such star @xmath15  mag . even in the case of notable ism extinction",
    "@xmath16  mag , the star would be detected by 2mass at the distance of the molecular cloud .",
    "similarly , ucac4 is complete from the brightest stars to about @xmath17  mag .",
    "this means that ucac4 is complete for mid - m stars at the distance of the taurus cloud for extinctions @xmath18  mag . as we do not expect large extinctions for our stars , because they were selected from the uv , we can conclude that we are complete for members of the star - forming region for the entire luminosity function , from the more massive to the less massive stars .",
    "this does not assure completeness down to m dwarfs at 140 pc ( e.g. lepine & gaidos 2011 ) .",
    "the galex ais survey is however , deep enough to reach the ttss population in the tmc .",
    "bright cttss such as rw  aur , k3 spectral type with @xmath19  mag ( ingleby et al .",
    "2013 ) , is found to have @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the galex bands and a wtts , such as v836  tau ( k7 ) with @xmath22 ( ingleby et al .",
    "2013 ) , has @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "both stars are at 140  pc from the sun .",
    "as shown below , the galex ais limiting magnitude in the , very demanding , fuv channel is 22.3 for this survey . in summary ,",
    "the survey must be complete to the tmc distance for cttss and most wttss , except for embedded sources and very late types .",
    "non extincted sources , as bright as rw  aur could be detected as far as 2.2  kpc .",
    "otherwise , rw  aur would be detectable even if extincted by @xmath25  mag instead of 0.5  mag ; the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) extinction law has been assumed ( see yuan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for a discussion about possible deviations of the ism extinction law in the nuv and fuv bands ) .    after the cross - correlation",
    ", we kept a total of 163,313 uv sources as reliable detections .",
    "all them have , at least , a 2mass counterpart at less than 3 arcsec .",
    "6 shows the density map of our sources in the selected region .",
    "the 2mass extinction map by lombardi et al . ( 2010 ) is overplotted .",
    "spatial binning is 3  arcmin@xmath7 and the color code ranges from 0 to 8 sources per arcmin .",
    "the stellar density is clearly not homogeneous .",
    "many regions suffer from large extinction , coinciding with the location of dense molecular clouds .",
    "however , the density of uv stars is also low in some regions where extinction is low as inferred from co or 2mass maps .",
    "we refer the reader to gmez de castro et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for a detailed discussion on this issue .",
    "notice that the galex survey is significantly shallower than the 2mass survey for galactic sources because extinction prevents uv radiation to propagate long distances in the galactic plane .",
    "henceforth , no uv candidates to ttss are lost in the cross - matching procedure .",
    "only 1% , from a grand total of 163,313 sources , are detected both in the nuv and fuv bands ; they constitute our working sample since our goal is to search for _ `` bona fide '' candidates _ instead of guaranteeing that no tts in the field is lost in the search . in practice , this means that some weak ttss or brown dwarfs may not be included in the list , being too faint to be detected in the fuv band .",
    "however , even with this restrictive criterium , the known ttss in the area mapped by the galex  ais are retrieved ( see below ) some of them , like lkca  1 lying very close to the sensitivity limit in the fuv band .",
    "the ( fuv - j , j - k ) and ( nuv - j , j - k ) diagrams are plotted in fig .  7 .",
    "notice that the colors of the vast majority of the sources agree with the predictions of the kurucz models for main sequence stars ( compare fig .  7 with fig .  4 in fh ) .",
    "the location of the iue qualification sample is clearly different from that of the dominant galactic population in the plot ; the j - k color of the classical ttss exceeds that of the field ( main ) sequence stars by more than @xmath26 according to fh s fig .",
    "4 .    at this point",
    ", it is worth remarking the differences between the procedures used in fh and in this work to identify ttss candidates . in this work ,",
    "we define candidates by _ `` tts class membership '' _ while fh define their ttss candidates by not - belonging to the",
    "_ `` main - sequence class membership '' _ , this last one being defined from a sample of field stars .",
    "fh used field stars photometry and an iterative procedure to define the locus of the main sequence stars by a linear regression line in the ( fuv - j ) and ( nuv - j ) versus ( j - k ) diagram .",
    "however , we identify as candidates those sources that _ share the same color than the well - known ttss of the iue template sample _ ; thus no further assumptions are introduced .",
    "according to our criterium , ttss candidates have to satisfy 7  mag@xmath2712  mag and 4  mag @xmath28  mag however , some fh s candidates lie outside these boundaries .",
    "the extinction arrows have been plotted using the coefficients derived by yuan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the fizpatrick extinction law .",
    "notice that the ttss in the qualification sample have well studied extinctions with @xmath29 mag ; the two wttss being very close to the field stars location .    at this point",
    "it is worth reminding the main sources of extinction in the ttss environment : the circumstellar ( cs ) and the interstellar medium ( ism ) . for the ttss in the tmc",
    ", ism extinction is mainly caused by the molecular cloud ; the complex is located at the outskirts of a low density bubble in the local ism ( see _ i.e. _ the ungerechts & thaddeus 1987 co survey of the area ) . at early stages , ttss can be deeply embedded in the cloud and totally occulted at uv or optical wavelengths ; as indicated above even a very bright ttss , such as rw  aur , would not be detected in the fuv band for @xmath30  mag .",
    "for this reason , the galex survey has avoided the dark molecular cores and only covers the halo where extinctions are significantly low , @xmath31  @xmath32 or @xmath33  mag , as inferred by comparing fig .  5 with lombardi et al 2010",
    "( see also gomez de castro et al .",
    "cs extinction is linked to the nature of the ttss ( dusty disk atmospheres , orientation effects , see _ i.e. _ watson et al . 2007 or dullemond et al . 2007 ) and , as such , it is used to qualify the candidates .",
    "the generic feature characterising the ttss is the co - existence of fuv , nuv and infrared excess ; this is also shown in fig .",
    "8 where the optical b , v , r bands are used as fiducial , pivot bands for the photospheric radiation .",
    "optical photometry has been retrieved after cross - correlation with ucac4 for the candidate sources ( see above ) .",
    "the separation between the ttss and the galactic stellar population is clean unless for weak lined ttss ( wttss ) .",
    "sources like ab  dor or hd  283572 ( see table  1 ) are located in the same region than main sequence stars in the color - color diagrams involving the nuv band .    in fig .",
    "9 , uv versus infrared colors are directly plotted .",
    "the uv color , fuv - nuv , is a mixed index that includes : [ 1 ] the excess of the hard uv radiation ( c  iv , si  iv , he  ii ) over the soft uv radiation ( balmer continuum , fe  ii , c  ii , mg  ii ) , as well as , [ 2 ] the excess radiation produced by the reprocessing of lyman  @xmath1 photons in the disk ( see i.e. france et al .",
    "2012 ) with respect to the photospheric and chromospheric radiation flux .",
    "this index is plotted against the j - k and the h - k infrared colors .",
    "h - k is considered to be a good estimator of the accretion rate ( see i.e. meyer et al .",
    "1997 for details ) however , wttss are not well discriminated from main sequence stars in h - k .",
    "the j - k color is a much more reliable tracer ( see fig .",
    "therefore , we will consider the fuv - nuv vs j - k diagram our prime diagram to select ttss candidates from the galex survey .",
    "notice that the impact of interstellar extinction in the candidates selection is small in the color - color diagrams . also , @xmath34  mag to shift a given source from the field stars stripe into the ttss locus within the diagram ( see sect .  3.3 for a discussion on wttss ) .",
    "we have also considered other diagrams such as nuv - r vs j - k and nuv - h vs j - k to search for candidates .",
    "they are useful to characterise the young stellar population in farther regions ( such as orion ) where most of the ttss are not detectable in the fuv band .",
    "a preliminary list of 315 ttss candidates has been generated including all sources that satisfy at least one of the following criteria :    * _ criterium i : fuv - nuv vs j - k_. ttss satisfy @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "cds provides information on the object type that it is defined as a hierarchical classification , which emphasises the physical nature of the object rather than a peculiar emission in some region of the electromagnetic spectrum or the location in peculiar clusters or external galaxies .",
    "the two main channels for feeding the database are the daily scanning of papers published in the astronomical literature providing new references and new identifiers for existing objects , as well as the complete ( or partial ) folding of selected catalogues into the database serves as a basis for improving the completeness and multi - wavelength coverage of the database ( see wenger et al .",

    "the wttss are close to the sensitivity boundary , they are the reddest sources in the plot . also note that the cttss are not only brighter but also significantly bluer than the wttss .",
    "we have computed statistic distribution function to this boundary for cttss and wttss to quantify this qualitative behaviour .",
    "the wttss distribution has a single peak with @xmath46  mag however , the cttss have a a main peak at @xmath47  mag and a broad tail to lower distances . this broad distribution is associated with the cttss spectral type , being m - type cttss located closer to the limiting magnitude boundary than earlier types .    in the fuv vs. fuv - nuv plot ( fig .",
    "11 ) , there is not such a clear trend .",
    "most of the candidates are close to the limiting magnitude boundary .",
    "it is worth noticing that stars as active as ab  dor should be detectable at the distance of the tmc from the galex  ais .    to get further insight into the low luminosity limit",
    ", we have retrieved from the hst archive , the ultraviolet spectrum of the only brown dwarf observed , 2mass  j12073346  39322539 , hereafter 2m1207 .",
    "this is an m8 brown dwarf located in the tw  hya association at 52.4  pc ( webb et al 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the observation only covers the fuv galex band .",
    "galex  ais limiting magnitude in this band , 22.3 , corresponds to a flux of @xmath48  erg  s@xmath49  @xmath32  @xmath49 which is slighty higher than the integrated 2m1207 flux in the fuv band ( @xmath50  erg  s@xmath49  @xmath32  @xmath49 ) ; 2m1207 fuv magnitude is 22.7 . in summary ,",
    "brown dwarfs similar to 2m1207 are very close to the galex  ais detection limit , if located at a distance comparable to the mean distance of the hyades open cluster , 45  pc , ( de bruijne et al .",
    "2001 ) , as shown in figure  11 .",
    "finally , note that the separation between cttss and wttss in fig .",
    "10 is nearly vertical , as the extinction law is .",
    "this shows that there is an _ extinction - accretion degeneracy _ ; extinction makes the sources weaker while accretion produces an increase in the ttss luminosity both , with a mild signature in the fuv - nuv color .",
    "two , out of the four criteria indicated in sect .",
    "3.1 , do not impose any constraint to the fuv - nuv color . as a result , the first list of candidates includes some hot sources with colors @xmath51 .",
    "some of these could be just hot stars in the field . in principle",
    ", we could remove them directly from the list of candidates but we have preferred to use a more sophisticated procedure that takes into account the sed ( and not just one color ) .",
    "however , we have detected some well known ttss , such as hbc  425 ( with @xmath52 ) that would be missed with this procedure .",
    "thus , we have decided to the sed to make a simple determination of the effective temperature and remove from our list of candidates sources with @xmath53 .",
    "we have built the optical sed for the whole set of candidates using ucac4 photometry ; the optical range is the best suited to estimate the stellar effective temperature for spectral types f - m .",
    "after , we have used the vosa tool of the virtual observatory to fit photospheric models to each candidate and determine its effective temperature .",
    "vosa combines the multiwavelength data from generic archives and catalogues within a vo environment to find the best fit to a predetermined set of theoretical models .",
    "the provided `` best '' fitting model is the one that minimises the value of the reduced @xmath54 defined as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the observed flux , @xmath57 the observational error in the flux , @xmath58 the number of photometric data points , @xmath59 the number of parameters being fitted , @xmath60 the theoretical flux predicted by the model and @xmath61 the multiplicative dilution factor , defined as @xmath62 ( for models from hauschildt et al . 1999 , allard et al . 2011 and chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath63 being the radius of the source and @xmath64 the distance to the object ( we refer the reader to bayo et al .",
    "2008 for a more detailed description of the method and the goodness of the estimates ) .",
    "stellar models implemented in vosa are kurucz , nextgen or dusty00 stellar models .",
    "the dusty00 synthetic models account properly for the effect of dust grains formation in the atmosphere of very cool stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "nextgen models represent a later elaboration in the synthetic spectra of cool stars ( see allard et al .",
    "2012 , for further details ) .    as standard output vosa produces several parameters including effective temperature .",
    "taking into account the few data points available per star , we have worked with a reduced set of free parameters fixing metallicity to solar and extinction to 0  mag .",
    "note that extinction causes the sed to become redder and thus cooler . as a result ,",
    "reddened hot stars may be kept in the sample but certainly those sources with high @xmath65 are not ttss since the uv excess of the ttss is not high enough to mimic early spectral types ( see fig .",
    "5 ) .    after rejection of sources with effective temperatures above 7500  k ,",
    "our list of candidates has reduced to 212 sources .",
    "as pointed out in sect .  3 , the detection of known ttss in the tmc has increased significantly the photometric data base of ttss in the galex bands from our primitive iue sample , especially concerning wttss .",
    "the new sample includes 15 wttss and 31 cttss , 10 of them m - type stars providing a better statistics for the candidates search . as shown in fig .",
    "12 , the best diagram to discriminate ttss from galactic field stellar population keeps being the fuv - nuv versus j - k diagram , however new trends can now be identified such as ,    * the locus of the wttss is well defined by the line : @xmath66 , with rms=0.59 .",
    "the dispersion of the wttss around this linear regression line has been computed and used to define the @xmath67 boundary marked with dashed lines in figure  12 . *",
    "the locus of the cttss in j - k is well defined by a normal distribution centered at @xmath68 with dispersion , @xmath69 . however , in fuv - nuv the only constraint set by the data is : @xmath70 , very similar to our criteria in sect .",
    "these constraints have been used to reduce the list of 212 candidates ( see sect .",
    "3 ) to just 63 ( see table  2 ) by basically , removing from the list of candidates those stars with small j - k and fuv - nuv colors .",
    "notice that there is some degree of overlapping between wttss and cttss that corresponds to hot wttss with low infrared excess and cttss with small infrared excess , _",
    "i.e. _ type ii - iii ttss according to the standard infrared sed classification ( wilking & lada 1983 ) .    using the constrains summarised above ,",
    "the candidates have been classified in table  2 as:_candidates to wtts _ , _ candidates to ctts _ or just _ candidates _ depending on their location in the fuv - nuv vs. j - k diagram .",
    "wttss candidates are stars within 3@xmath71 of the wttss regression line that satisfy @xmath72 , to ensure they are not in the area where the wttss and the cttss overlap in the diagram .",
    "cttss candidates are stars satisfying @xmath73 and lying outside the @xmath67 boundary around the wttss regression line . the rest of the sources have just been classified as tts candidates .",
    "notice that both wttss and cttss cover a broad range in fuv - nuv . in wttss ,",
    "the fuv - nuv excess correlates well with the j - k excess but this is not the case for cttss .",
    "these stars are surrounded by accretion disks that are luminous in the infrared bands breaking the expected correlation between the uv and infrared excess , associated with the stellar spectral type . in an accretion dominated sed , the correlation between the uv and ir excess should have a different functional form than observed in stars ; moreover , inclination effects and extinction would affect in a different manner to the disk radiation and the uv radiation from the accretion shocks and the stellar magnetosphere ; cttss with similar accretion rates / luminosities and j - k color may show small or high fuv - nuv values depending on whether the disk is seen face - on or pole - on , respectively , see _ i.e. _ the determination of the disk inclination in the so - called silhouette disks ( odell et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , the uncorrelated combination of all these effects is the most likely cause of the spreading observed in fig .",
    "the distribution of uv ttss and candidates on the tmc is displayed in fig .",
    "13 ; the already known cttss and wttss are labeled .",
    "the new sources are concentrated in the filaments around @xmath74 and @xmath75 between the auriga and the california complexes .",
    "notice that there is not a correlation between the spatial density of uv sources and ttss candidates ( compare fig .  5 with fig  15 ) .",
    "the proper motions of the pms stars in the region from doucourant et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are overlayed in fig .  15 for reference .",
    "they indicate the average direction of the tmc motion in the plane of the sky .",
    "as pointed out by gmez de castro & pudritz 1992 , the good kinematical coupling between the ttss and the molecular cloud in radial velocity can be extrapolated to the filaments kinematics in the plane of the sky .",
    "a global scenario was proposed by gmez de castro & pudritz ( 1992 ) for star formation in taurus . according to it ,",
    "the driving energy source of the cloud hydromagnetic turbulence is the cascading of a large magnetic wave unveiled by the polarization maps of the region ( moneti et al .",
    "recent evidence of hydromagnetic waves action in the taurus filaments has been found by heyer & brunt ( 2012 ) from the analysis of the co data in davis et al .",
    "according to this global scenario the youngest sources should be at the cloud front where the molecular gas is concentrated .",
    "the most evolved ttss are thus expected , to be located at the rear of the cloud where most of the new candidates to ttss unveiled by this work have been found .",
    "from an initial sample of about 350,000 uv sources in the tmc according to the galex - ais catalogue , a list of 63 bona fide candidates to ttss has been produced .",
    "for this purpose , a first set of selection criteria have been defined based on the uv photometric properties of the ttss to create an initial set of 315 candidates to ttss ; the simbad service has been used to guarantee that only stellar unknown sources , or known sources classified as ttss or emission line stars are included .",
    "we have validated the procedure by recovering the 31 known ttss in the area of the survey .    as an additional result ,",
    "we have generated a list containing 15 wttss and 31 cttss that can be used as a qualification sample for uv - ir searches of ttss in star forming regions .",
    "this qualification sample has been used to statistically improve the candidates selection criteria producing the final list of 63 bona fide ttss candidates .",
