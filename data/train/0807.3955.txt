    "the antennae ( ngc  4038/39 ) are the nearest example of a major merger involving two gas - rich disk galaxies of comparable mass .",
    "they allow us to study processes of dissipational galaxy assembly from close up , thus providing a valuable glimpse of what must have been more frequent events in the early universe .",
    "the antennae have been observed extensively at all wavelengths ( e.g. , x - rays : @xcite ; uv : @xcite ; optical : @xcite ; ir : @xcite ; and 21-cm line : @xcite ) and have also been repeatedly modeled via n - body and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "an accurate distance to this prototypical merger is of obvious importance in assessing its structure and dynamics , as well as for determining the physical properties of its myriad of stars , star clusters , peculiar objects such as ulxs ( ultraluminous x - ray sources ) , and gas clouds .",
    "traditionally , the distance to ngc  4038/39 has most often been derived from the systemic recession velocity and an adopted hubble constant @xmath8 , with or without corrections for deviations of the hubble flow from linearity due to various attractors .",
    "a frequently used modern value for the distance is 19.2 mpc @xcite .",
    "this value is based on a systemic recession velocity relative to the local group of @xmath9 km  s@xmath1@xcite , a linear hubble flow , and @xmath10 km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "updated to the _ hst _  key project s derived @xmath11 km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1@xcite , this often - used distance to the antennae becomes @xmath12 mpc .",
    "a significantly shorter distance of @xmath2 mpc has recently been determined by @xcite via photometry of the trgb in a region near the tip of the southern tidal tail .",
    "this photometry  performed on new , deep images obtained with _ hst _ s advanced camera for surveys ( acs)seems to support the short distance derived earlier from _",
    "images of the same region by the same method @xcite .",
    "if the short distance is correct , the antennae `` diminish '' in physical size , mass , and luminosity , as do their stars , clusters , and gas clouds .",

    "* hereafter tbad00 ) by about 500 km  s@xmath1or 2.7@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "clearly , new measurements of the distance to the antennae by independent methods are highly desirable . in the present paper",

    "supernova 2007sr was discovered by the catalina sky survey on 2007 december 18.53 ut @xcite , about 4.2 days after @xmath14 maximum @xcite .",
    "since it was of type ia @xcite , it was followed by the carnegie supernova project ( csp ) as part of their low - z campaign @xcite , with observations beginning on 2007 december 20.33 ut .",
    "figure  [ fig01 ] shows the sn on a stacked @xmath15 image obtained with the swope 1  m telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the csp measured light curves for the sn using the filter set @xmath16 from 6 days until approximately 130 days after @xmath14 maximum . appendix  [ appa ] gives some details about the photometric system and calibration , while its table  [ tab : photometry ] lists all measured magnitudes and their uncertainties .",
    "it is now well known that supernovae of type ia ( sn  ia ) can serve as excellent standard candles and have been used to both discover the presence @xcite and constrain the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "once corrected for extinction and the well - known correlation between intrinsic luminosity and decline rate of the light curve @xcite , sne  ia  have an intrinsic dispersion of approximately @xmath17 mag .",
    "we can therefore use sn 2007sr to constrain the distance to ngc  4038/39 to this level .    because sn 2007sr was caught after maximum",
    ", it is necessary to use sn  ia  light - curve templates to estimate the peak magnitude in each passband as well as the decline - rate parameter , defined as the change in @xmath14 magnitude between maximum and 15 days later in the rest frame of the sn .",
    "this parameter will allow us to correct for the intrinsic luminosity of the sn and also to predict its intrinsic colors , from which we can derive the host galaxy extinction .",
    "more formally , we model the light curve in each passband @xmath18 with the following formula : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the light - curve template for passband @xmath18 , @xmath21 is the time of maximum for the @xmath14 light curve , @xmath22 is the absolute magnitude in passband @xmath18 of a sn  ia  with @xmath23 mag , @xmath24 is the slope of the luminosity  relationship , @xmath25 is the @xmath26-correction in passband @xmath18 , and @xmath27 is the true distance modulus .",
    "the extinctions from the milky way and host galaxy are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the color excess due to the milky way foreground extinction is taken from @xcite , which for the position of sn 2007sr corresponds to @xmath30 mag .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath24 are determined from the set of sne  ia  observed by the csp in the first - year campaign by assuming a fixed cosmological model ( @xmath31 km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ; @xcite ) , computing distance moduli from the observed redshifts of the host galaxies , correcting for milky - way and host - galaxy extinction , and fitting the resulting absolute peak magnitudes in each passband to the formula @xmath34 the details of this procedure are given in folatelli et al .",
    "( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "in performing this calibration , it has become apparent that  for whatever reason  a standard reddening law with the typical milky way value of @xmath35 does not provide a good fit to this sample of sne  ia .",
    "instead , we obtain a value @xmath36 ( folatelli et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "other groups have also found surprisingly low values of @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the sne  ia  being embedded in an environment that differs significantly from a typical ism , or perhaps there is another , intrinsic color ",
    "magnitude effect at play that has been inadvertently combined with @xmath37 .",
    "whatever the reason , we are interested in a distance determination and therefore appeal to the empirical result @xmath38 .",
    "however , we note that changing  in equation  ( [ eq : lc_model ] ) does not only affect the extinction term , but also changes the values of @xmath22 because the calibrating sample has a non - zero average extinction .",
    "indeed , only a sn with an extinction equal to the average extinction of the calibrating sample would be insensitive to changes in . in the case of sn 2007sr",
    ", the extinction is slightly larger than for the calibrating sample , whence an increase in  would slightly decrease the distance modulus .",
    "specifically , changing  from @xmath39 to @xmath40 would change the estimated true distance modulus of this sn by @xmath410.06 mag .",
    "for sn 2007sr .",
    "for clarity , magnitudes in the different passbands have been offset by amounts indicated in the legend .",

    "error bars are all smaller than the data points .",
    "epoch 0 corresponds to peak brightness in the @xmath14 band on 2007 december 14.3 ut .",
    "[ fig02 ] ]    the light - curve templates @xmath20 are constructed in a manner similar to that used by @xcite and further described in burns et al .",
    "( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "essentially , the highest - quality optical light curves from the csp , which have clearly observed maxima , are fit with a cubic spline , from which , @xmath21 , and the peak magnitude are extracted .",
    "these light curves then define a sparsely sampled 2d surface in @xmath42@xmath43 space . a template of any given",
    "can then be generated by 2d interpolation of this surface . at present",
    ", there are an insufficient number of near - infrared ( nir ) light curves with which to construct templates in this way .",
    "fortunately , the decline - rate parameter for sn 2007sr ( @xmath44 mag ) is nearly identical to that of sn 2006x ( @xmath45 mag ) , for which the csp has obtained high - quality nir photometry well before and after @xmath14 maximum .",
    "we therefore use spline fits of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 light curves of sn 2006x as templates for fitting the @xmath46 and @xmath47 data of sn 2007sr .",
    "the @xmath48 light curves of sn 2007sr are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] along with the best - fit models for the optical data given by equation  ( [ eq : lc_model ] ) .",
    "the extracted light - curve parameters of interest are the true distance modulus of sn 2007sr , @xmath49 mag , the color excess due to the host galaxy , @xmath50 mag , and the decline - rate parameter @xmath51 mag .",
    "the value of this parameter is a typical value for sne  ia , and the color excess is reasonably low as one would expect for a source far from the host center .",
    "the uncertainties are derived from the covariance matrix of the fit to the light curves , scaled so that @xmath52 . to be conservative",
    ", we add to the uncertainty in @xmath27 the following systematic errors : ( 1 ) @xmath53 mag for the intrinsic dispersion in sn  ia luminosities , ( 2 ) uncertainties in the calibration parameters of @xmath54 , @xmath55 mag , and @xmath56 , and ( 3 ) an uncertainty in the hubble constant of @xmath57 km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 . with this error budget",
    ", we arrive at a final distance estimate to sn 2007sr of @xmath58 mpc ( @xmath59 mag ) using the optical data .    as a check on this distance",
    "we also fitted the @xmath46- and @xmath47-band data with templates generated from sn 2006x in order to estimate the peak magnitudes : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we then used the calibration by @xcite , @xmath62 mag and @xmath63 mag , to compute an average distance modulus of @xmath64 mag .",
    "this modulus , based on nir data and an independent calibration , is nearly insensitive to assumptions about the reddening law of the dust in the host galaxy and agrees with the formal modulus of @xmath65 mag from the optical data to within the combined errors , thus supporting the derived distance of @xmath3 mpc .",
    "as we demonstrate below , the new sn  ia  distance to ngc  4038/39 agrees well with the distance inferred from the system s recession velocity and the large - scale flow model by tbad00 .",
    "if the short distance of @xmath2 mpc measured by @xcite were to be correct , it would create at least three serious problems : ( 1 ) ngc  4038/39 would have an exceptionally large peculiar recession velocity of about @xmath66522 km  s@xmath1 ; ( 2 ) sn 2007sr would have had a peak luminosity differing by @xmath671.1 mag , or about 7@xmath68 , from the mean peak luminosity of sne  ia ; and ( 3 ) the antennae would lose their membership in tully s ( 1988 ) group 221 of 13 galaxies .",
    "we now discuss these three problems in turn and then point out a likely error in the derivation of the short distance by @xcite .      a careful assessment of the many radial velocities measured for ngc  4038/39 and compiled in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) yields a systemic heliocentric velocity of @xmath69 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] compares this systemic velocity with recession velocities predicted by the large - scale flow model , which is based on surface - brightness fluctuation distances to 300 early - type galaxies ( tbad00 ) .",
    "the antennae are plotted at both the short distance and the new sn  iadistance , while the solid curve represents the predicted large - scale flow velocity in their direction .",
    "the undulation in the model curve reflects the gravitational influences of the virgo cluster , whose center lies @xmath70 away from the antennae , and of the great attractor .",
    "as the figure illustrates , with the new sn  ia  distance the antennae fall within @xmath71 km  s@xmath1  or @xmath660.1  of the predicted flow velocity , where @xmath72 km  s@xmath1  is the best - fit `` thermal '' ( or random ) radial - velocity dispersion of the model .",
    "if instead we choose the short distance , the peculiar velocity becomes @xmath66522 ( @xmath73 ) km  s@xmath1  or @xmath662.8 , clearly an exceptionally high value .",
    "we conclude that the newly measured sn  ia  distance is in significantly better agreement with the best available large - scale flow model than the short distance is .    .",
    "plotted at the new distance based on type ia sn 2007sr ( _ filled dot _ ) , the recession velocity of ngc  4038/39 falls well within 1@xmath74 ( _ dotted lines _ ) of the large - scale flow , where @xmath74 is the cosmic random radial velocity .",
    "in contrast , when plotted at the short distance based on the trgb ( _ square _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the recession velocity of ngc  4038/39 lies 522 km  s@xmath1  or 2.8@xmath13 above the flow . for details , see   [ sec3.1 ] .",
    "[ fig03 ] ]      our determination of a distance of @xmath75 mpc to sn 2007sr has been based on the assumption that this sn reached the _",
    "mean _ absolute magnitude @xmath76 typical for its decline rate .",
    "the quoted distance error includes a term reflecting the intrinsic dispersion of the corrected peak absolute magnitudes @xmath77 of sne  iaaround the mean value @xmath76 , which is @xmath78 mag for csp observations of similar quality (   [ sec2 ] ) .    _",
    "if _ the short distance of 13.3 mpc were to be correct , sn 2007sr would have reached a peak absolute magnitude that differed by @xmath79 mag , or about 7@xmath68 , from the mean value for sne  ia .",
    "this seems quite unlikely , given the spectral normality of sn 2007sr @xcite . to illustrate this normality , fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] shows an optical spectrum obtained by the csp on 2007 december 27.33 ut with the baade 6.5  m telescope and imacs spectrograph , corresponding to an epoch of 13  days after @xmath14 maximum . for comparison",
    ", we include the sn  ia template spectrum by @xcite at + 13  days .",
    "although there are small differences between the two spectra , the overall resemblance is extremely close , demonstrating that sn 2007sr was both photometrically and spectroscopically a completely normal sn  ia .",
    "hence , its extraordinarily low peak luminosity ( by 7@xmath68 ! ) , were it to lie at 13.3 mpc from us , is a second good reason for distrusting the short distance .",
    "identifications of the major absorption features are taken from @xcite .",
    "the spectrum has been corrected for reddening produced in both the milky way and the antennae , and has been shifted to a rest wavelength scale .",

    "is also shown .",
    "[ fig04 ] ]      based on their position in the sky and recession velocity , @xcite assigned the antennae to group 221 in the crater cloud .",

    "none of these distances is less than 20 mpc @xcite .",

    "both galaxies lie within @xmath671.0  from the antennae . were the antennae to lie at the short distance of 13.3 mpc",
    ", it would be difficult to understand why two nearby postulated group members with very similar recession velocities ( @xmath6652 and @xmath4124 km",
    "s@xmath1  relative to the antennae , respectively ) should lie at much larger distances . again",
    ", the evidence favors both the large - scale flow distance of @xmath5 mpc ( see   [ sec4 ] ) and our new sn  ia  distance of @xmath3 mpc to the antennae .",
    "why is the trgb distance of @xmath2 mpc determined by @xcite so discrepant ?",
    "the answer seems to lie in a misidentification of what constitutes the true trgb of the mixed - age stellar populations near the tip of the southern tidal tail . the area imaged by @xcite  with _",
    "hst_/acs contains several  regions @xcite and a very blue , dwarf - like feature dubbed the `` s78 region '' and now recognized to be the bent -rich tip of the southern tail @xcite .    in their figure  3 , @xcite display two luminosity functions ( lf ) for the rgb , one derived for the s78 region and the other for a `` ne region '' that is free of  and also , supposedly , of relatively young stars .",
    "the lf of the s78 region shows a relatively sharp rise at @xmath82 mag ( where @xmath83 is an instrumental magnitude close to the kron ",
    "cousin @xmath84 magnitude ) , which @xcite  identify as the trgb but which  given the  and blue stellar content of the s78 region  seems equally likely to be caused by relatively young agb stars .",
    "in contrast , the lf of the gas - free ne region shows only a minor sharp rise there , but features a more significant `` discontinuity at @xmath85 mag '' @xcite that falls within @xmath860.2 mag of the trgb expected for a distance of 22 mpc .",
    "while @xcite  dismiss this discontinuity as possibly `` due to the rgb of a younger , @xmath67200 myr population , '' we suggest that its stars  being _ fainter _ than the claimed trgb  actually mark the true location of the trgb .    to check on this suggestion , we downloaded the acs / wfc ( wide field camera ) frames obtained under proposal go-10580 ( p.i . :",
