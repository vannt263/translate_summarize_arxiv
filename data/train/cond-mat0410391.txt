    "gauge theory description has become essential in studying doped mott insulators .",
    "the physical necessity may be traced to the hilbert space restriction in a doped mott insulator .",
    "for instance , the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors at half - filling are believed to be an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator @xcite , in which the charge sector at low energy is totally frozen up by the coulomb interaction . after doping ,",
    "the low - energy charge degrees of freedom do emerge , but remain highly restricted in the hilbert space @xcite . to characterize such a hilbert space restriction , a spin - charge separation description , namely , by introducing @xcite spinless holon  of charge @xmath1 and neutral spin-@xmath2 spinon  as the essential _",
    "building blocks _ of the restricted hilbert space , has become an effective and useful way . here",
    "holons  and spinons  do not necessarily turn out to be true low - lying elementary excitations in the end , because generally local gauge field(s ) will emerge @xcite to mediate interactions between these holons  and spinons ,  and may even lead to the _ confinement _ of them if either a true spin - charge separation does not exist or the decomposition is not done in a correct way . in general , one always ends up with a gauge theory description for doped mott insulators where the gauge interaction can greatly influence the low - energy dynamics of the charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "several kinds of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theories have been proposed for doped two - dimensional ( 2d )  spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnets related to the high-@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "a @xmath4 gauge theory @xcite based on the slave - boson approach to the @xmath5 model is one of the most intensively studied .",
    "its gauge structure may be directly visualized by noting the gauge invariance of the electron operator in the slave - boson decomposition anderson1 @xmath6under a transformation : @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the bosonic holonoperator and @xmath10 the fermionic spinon  operator@xmath11 along the same line , the non - abeliangauge theories@xciteand@xmath12 gauge theories @xcite have also been proposed and studied . *  *    the slave - boson approach is considered to be convenient in dealing with the superconducting ( sc ) regime but has less advantage in describing the af state near half - filling . on the other hand ,",
    "gauge theories wie , shankar , lee2,weng1,su , ng based on the slave - fermion , schwinger boson decomposition are believed to be useful in studying a lightly doped af state . here the electron operator is written as @xcite @xmath13where @xmath14  denotes the fermionic holon  operator and @xmath15  the bosonic spinon  operator .",
    "besides the slave - boson and slave - fermion decompositions , slave - anyon decompositions have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "different gauge structures mentioned above originate from different decompositions and/or different mean - field decouplings . but a common feature for these gauge theories is that both holon  and spinon  share the same gauge field .",
    "recently , a different gauge theory description has been constructed phase - string1 based on a distinctive decomposition of the electron operator @xcite    @xmath16    which is known as the _ bosonization _ @xcite or _",
    "phase string decomposition _",
    "@xcite because holon and spinon operators , @xmath17 and @xmath15 , are both bosonic , with the fermionic commutations relations of the electron operator being restored by the phase string operator , @xmath18 } $ ] . here _ internal _ gauge invariance appears as @xmath19 :  @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ". consequently there exist a pair of @xmath19 gauge fields coupling to the holon and spinon fields , respectively , in the resulting gauge theory , called the phase string model , derived phase - string1 based on the decomposition ( [ ps ] ) and the bosonic resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) mean - field saddle - point , where the normal gauge freedom @xcite ( like the one in the slave - boson case ) is broken by the mean - field decoupling @xcite .    in the slave - boson ( or slave - fermion ) u(1 )",
    "gauge theory , the external u(1 ) gauge field ( i.e. , the electromagnetic field ) couples to _ both _ holons and spinons @xcite , thanks to the same _ internal _",
    "u(1 ) gauge field they share .",
    "so both holon and spinon carry some fractions of the electron charge @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the phase string model , the external electromagnetic field only couples to the holon degrees of freedom , without being directly transferred to the spinon part as the latter sees a different gauge field . in this sense , the holon carries the full charge of @xmath1  in the phase string model .    without a bare kinetic energy , the single gauge field in the slave - boson ( or slave - fermion ) theory fluctuations strongly @xcite , which makes the theory a strong - coupling one . on the other hand , the @xmath19 gauge fields are topological ones with their strengths constrained to the densities of two matter fields ( see sec .",
    "ii ) such that their fluctuations are much more mildly , suitable for a perturbative treatment .",
    "in particular , the no - double - occupancy constraint of the doped mott insulator , which is enforced by the violent gauge fluctuations in the slave - boson ( or slave - fermion ) theory , is realized in the phase string model in a quite different way .",
    "namely , the @xmath24 topological gauge fields will introduce mutual repulsions between holons and spinons , where holons perceive spinons as vortices and vice versa .",
    "as it is well known , a particle can not go to the core of a vortex of its own field where the density of such a matter field vanishes . in the phase string model",
    "such a vortex core of one species is always occupied by a different species such that the no - double - occupancy is naturally enforced .",
    "furthermore , the weak ( logarithmic ) confinement of spinons and holons at low energies and low temperatures has been also found @xcite in the phase string model , as opposed to the strong confinement in usual 2d compact gauge models in slave - boson or slave - fermion theory @xcite . in the latter",
    ", an effective gauge theory may have a serious infrared divergence @xcite which makes the gauge theory very difficult to deal with mathematically .",
    "the former is usually much more manageable than the latter in this regard .",
    "however , the hamiltonian formalism @xcite of the phase string model , in which a gauge field seen by one species is constrained to the density ( number ) of different species , is not very convenient for studies beyond the mean - field level . in this paper",
    ", we shall develop a lagrangian ( path - integral ) formalism of the phase string model .",
    "we show that the effective low - energy lagrangian describes two matter fields , holon and spinon , minimally couple to two _ _ different _ _ * *  * * gauge fields .",
    "these gauge fields have no their own kinetic terms either , but there is a _ mutual - chern - simons _",
    "term which entangles two gauge fields together .",
    "we call this as a mutual - chern - simons description , which constitutes a minimal field - theory description for the phase string theory",
    ".    the gauge structure of such a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional mutual - chern - simons theory is very unique in many aspects as compared to the gauge theories proposed before .",
    "we demonstrate that the physical symmetries , which include parity , time - reversal , and spin rotational symmetries , are precisely preserved in such an effective theory . by contrast , in usual chern - simons ( anyon ) theories @xcite , the parity and time - reversal symmetries are explicitly broken , including the mutual - chern - simons theory previously proposed @xcite for describing the double - layer quantum hall effect system .",
    "we further show that there exist two low - temperature phases in such a theory at low doping .",
    "one is an af state which recovers the af long range order ( aflro ) of the heisenberg model at half - filling and may survive at small doping concentration . the other is an sc state .",
    "two phases are characterized by dual meissner effects and dual flux quantization conditions , accompanied by a dual confinement , which are the direct consequences of the mutual - chern - simons gauge fields interacting with two matter fields when one of them experiences bose condensation .",
    "such a mutual duality connecting the af and sc states or spin and charge degrees of freedom , is quite different from the usual duality descriptions proposed @xcite for the cuprate superconductors , where the conventional boson - vortex duality is used to describe an ordered - disordered transition .    in the sc phase ,",
    "for example , the meissner effect and @xmath25 flux quantization are similar to the predictions by a conventional superconductivity theory , and the spinons are found to be confined such that to drop out of the physical spectrum .",
    "only _ integer _",
    "spin excitations , as composed of confined spinon pairs , are allowed in the bulk state .",
    "but as a unique prediction , a single spinon ( an @xmath26 moment ) does appear in the center of a magnetic vortex core .",
    "it forecasts that the spin fractionalization will occur in the pseudogap phase , as the latter may be viewed as the proliferation of the vortex core state above the superconducting transition @xmath0 @xcite .    in the af phase ,",
    "on the other hand , the spinon condensation may be viewed as a two - component superfluidity .",
    "the dual meissner effect means that a holon is an alien  object in the spinon condensate , and the dual flux quantization condition corresponds to that a meron ( vortex ) is produced in the spinon condensate to which a holon must be confined to , just like a spinon is confined to a magnetic vortex core in the above - mentioned sc state . as a result ,",
    "only the neutralobject of a holon - meron composite , not the holon itself , appears in the low - energy physical spectrum , which has a dipolar spin configuration at long distance , coexisting with the aflro in a dilute hole concentration regime .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the effective hamiltonian of the phase string model . in sec .",
    "iii , we first derive the lagrangian ( path - integral ) formalism in the lattice version .",
    "then we obtain the low - energy mutual - chern - simons gauge theory description in the continuum limit . in sec .",
    "iv , we examine the symmetries , including parity , time - reversal , and spin rotational symmetries , of the mutual - chern - simons theory . in sec .",
    "v , we study two low - temperature ordered phases based on the mutual - chern - simons theory and discuss how holons and spinons behave in the af and sc phases , respectively , where dual confinement of holons / spinons is revealed . finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the phase string theory has been proposed @xcite as a low - energy effective description of the doped antiferromagnets at low doping .",
    "the minimal  hamiltonian of the phase string theory is composed of two terms , @xmath27 in which the charge degrees of freedom are characterized by the holon  term    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and the holonoperator , @xmath30 is bosonic ; the spin degrees of freedom as described by the spinon  term @xmath31where @xmath32 and the spinonoperator , @xmath33 is also bosonic . here",
    "the gauge fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 are decided by the topological constraints :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the spinon  ( with index @xmath39 ) and holon  number operators at site @xmath40 , respectively , and the path @xmath41 is an arbitrary loop made of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) links with @xmath42 denoting the area enclosed by @xmath43    basic features of this model are as follows . at half filling ,",
    "the gauge field @xmath35 can be set to zero in ( [ hs ] ) and @xmath44 reduces to the schwinger - boson mean - field hamiltonian @xcite , which describes both the long - range and short - range af correlations fairly well . upon doping , @xmath45 is no longer trivial due to constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) , which describes that each holon  behaves like a @xmath46-fluxoid as felt by the spinons .",
    "thus , @xmath35 will play the role of dynamic frustrations , introduced by doped holes , that acts on the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly , the holons  are also subjected to dynamic frustrations , from the spin background , via the gauge field @xmath47 in ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "the spin and charge degrees of freedom are thus mutually frustrated  in the phase - string model in terms of two topological gauge fields , @xmath35 and @xmath47 .",
    "the phase string model outlined above incorporates , as a minimal model , three most essential characteristics of the doped antiferromagnets described by the @xmath5 model .",
    "they are : ( i ) the restricted hilbert space of doped mott insulators , which is characterized by the spin - charge separation formalism with holons and spinons as basic building blocks ; ( ii ) strong short - range af correlations as provided by the bosonic rvb description in ( [ hs ] ) , which can naturally grow into an aflro state as the doping concentration is reduced to zero ; ( iii ) the mutual singular influence between the charge and spin degrees of freedom as represented by two topological gauge fields , @xmath45 and @xmath47 , which mathematically capture the phase string effect identified @xcite in the @xmath5 model .",
    "such a mutual interaction has been shown @xcite to be responsible for some nontrivial physical properties of the model in close connection with the high-@xmath0 materials .    in the phase string formalism , the spin operators are expressed in terms of the spinon operators in the following nontrivial form @xcite    @xmath48    where the phase @xmath49 appearing in @xmath50 can be decided by the relation @xmath51 for two nn sites , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which are not occupied by the holes . under this definition ,",
    "the spin operators as well as the effective hamiltonian are invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the holon - dependent phase factor @xmath49 in ( [ operators ] ) further illustrates the intrinsic mutual entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom in the phase string theory .",
    "the treatment of the hamiltonian formalism of the phase string model may not be convenient beyond the mean - field approximation because the gauge fields , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , defined in ( [ constraint2 ] ) , are themselves operators depending on the dynamics of the matter fields . in order to deal with the phase string model [ ( [ hh ] ) and ( [ hs ] ) ] more conveniently",
    ", a lagrangian ( path - integral ) formalism will be introduced in this section .",
    "first of all , let us re - express the topological constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) locally .",
    "as pointed out before , the original no - double - occupancy constraint in the @xmath5 model can be realized in the phase string model by the mutual repulsion between spinons and holons via @xmath35 and @xmath34 . as a consequence",
    ", the closed path @xmath41 of a holon / spinon in ( constraint2 ) will not cross spinons / holons and thus effectively avoid a singularity occurring when a spinon and a holon simultaneously stay at the same site ( as each spinon / holon carries a @xmath46-fluxoid seen by a holon / spinon ) . following this , then , it is physically reasonable to implement a regularization in the topological constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) by introducing two sets of dual square lattices , respectively , for spinons and holons to stay , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ duallattice ] . in this way , a closed path @xmath41 for spinon and a @xmath57 for holon on different lattices can be arbitrary without worrying to cross the opposite species , either holons or spinons .",

    "a spinon ( denoted by an arrow ) and a holon ( denoted by an open circle ) stay in dual lattices ( solid and dashed ones , respectively ) , with the gauge fields @xmath35 and @xmath58 defined on the links of two dual lattices , respectively .",
    "the closed loop , @xmath41 ( @xmath57)@xmath59 of a spinon ( holon ) can be arbitary without crossing holons ( spinons ) .",

    "note the slightly different definitions of link variables and lattice difference operators on two dual lattices , so as to keep the symmetric forms in ( [ constraint ] ) .    in the path - integral formulation , the topological constraint ( constraint ) can be enforced by introducing two lagrangian multipliers , @xmath79 and @xmath80 as follows @xmath81 -i\\sum_{i}a_{0}^{h}(i)\\left [ \\sum_{\\sigma } \\sigma n_{i\\sigma } ^{b}-\\frac{1}{% \\pi } \\epsilon ^{\\alpha \\beta } \\delta _ { \\alpha } a_{\\beta } ^{s}(i)\\right ] .",

    "according to the condition ( [ dualflux ] ) , one expects to find equal number of holons and ( anti)merons at low temperatures , which are paired by the logarithmic - attractive interaction in ( [ v ] ) .",
    "an unpaired holon or ( anti)meron will cost a logarithmically divergent energy and thus is forbidden to appear . in other words , in the af phase , a bare holon can not exist alone , but has to be always confined to a spin topological configuration ( meron ) . such an effect in the spin ordered phase",
    "is called the _ holon confinement_.",
    "note that a holon itself will also carry a spin vortex according to ( [ operators ] ) , the composite object formed by the holon - meron pair actually corresponds to a spin dipolar configuration in the _ real _ spin space , as previous identified in the phase string model @xcite . since the ( anti)meron is a semiclassical object without a coherent quantum dynamics , the dipole as a bound pair of a holon and a ( anti)meron normally can not move coherently either .",

    "correspondingly , ( [ q ] ) may be called a _ dual flux - quantization condition_.    finally we remark that the hole self - trapping at low doping , discussed in the present work , is in contrast to a conventional picture for single hole moving in the af background based on the numerical studies of the @xmath5 model @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the doped hole is found to have finite spectral weight and a coherent dispersion with the bandwidth comparable to @xmath261 the discrepancy may arise from the small sample sizes in exact diagonalization calculations : the phase string effect , which leads to the mutual chern - simons gauge fields , starts to play the role of self - localization only when the sample sizes become larger than the localization length scales @xcite .",
    "further investigations from both analytic and numerical approaches to clarify this issue are needed .",
    "possible experimental implications of self - trapping for lightly doped cuprate have been previously discussed in the phase string model @xcite .",

    "since @xmath286 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 are all quantized to be integers , we find the minimal _ flux quantization condition _",
    "@xmath294where @xmath295 ( @xmath296 in full units ) is the flux quantum for a charge @xmath154 system .",
    "therefore , the external magnetic flux is not allowed to present in the bulk ( i.e. , the meissner effect ) unless it is quantized in multiples of half flux quanta given in ( [ fq ] ) .",
    "in particular , for a magnetic flux quantized at the minimal half flux quantum @xmath297 , there must be a spinon trapped near the vortex core according to ( [ cn - sc ] ) by noting that the charge  @xmath298 of the vortices produced by holon field is always in units of @xmath289 ( i.e. , @xmath299 ) .",
    "however , free spinons are not allowed in the bulk in the absence of the external magnetic flux .",
    "indeed , for @xmath300 the charge neutral  condition ( [ cn - sc ] ) reduces to @xmath301 . as the result",
    ", a single spinon excitation , with @xmath302 will violate the charge neutral  condition , which in fact will cost a logarithmically divergent energy as each spinon behaves like a half vortex .",
    "hence , in the superconducting state , the spinons - vortices must be always paired up ( confined ) in the bulk by the logarithmic force given in ( [ vsc ] ) .",
    "to be noted , not only the spinons with different spin indices ( up / down ) can pair up , those with the same spin indices ( up / up and down / down ) can also pair up to satisfy the charge neutral condition by involving a holon phase vortex with @xmath303 , _",
    "@xmath304 or @xmath305 .",
    "since @xmath293 does not appear in the rest of the action , these two excitations of @xmath306 are energy degenerate with the state @xmath307 @xmath308 , to form @xmath309 triplet spin excitations , consistent with the spin rotation symmetry generally demonstrated before .",
    "for the same reason , the single spinon bound to a magnetic vortex quantized at @xmath310 should have a free moment with @xmath311 , because of the freedom introduced by @xmath312 .",
    "thus , the superconducting phase in the present mutual - chern - simons theory is characterized by the holon condensation and spinon ( logarithmic ) confinement .",
    "we have seen that the fractionalization of spins ( a single spinon ) does not directly appear in the bulk low - lying excitation spectrum , but does show up in a magnetic vortex core @xcite .",
    "the deconfinement of spinon - vortex pairs will eventually occur at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 @xcite . finally , we point out that the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter , which is expressed in terms of the electron operator ( [ ps ] ) , is d - wave like as discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the doping effect and the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom are characterized by a mutual - chern - simons gauge structure in this model , as discussed in previous sections .",
    "the mutually dual characteristics of these two phases are summarized by the following table .",
    "@xmath313    we have shown that , at low doping , the spinon condensation leads to a spin af order and forces a confinement  on the holon part , making holons self - localized to ensure the aflro . on the other hand , at a higher doping ,",
    "the condensation of bosonic holons forces a confinement  on the spinon part , resulting an sc phase coherence .",
    "there are several distinctions between the two ordered phases . in the af phase ,",
    "the spinons condensate is a kind of two - component superfluid .",
    "consequently the global symmetry is broken from to in contrast , the ground state in the sc phase is a condensation of a scalar field - holons . as a result the global symmetry of the charge part is broken .",
    "besides such a fundamental distinction , two phases share some common features originated from the duality in the mutual - chern - simons gauge structure . in both the af and sc phases , there exist induced maxwell terms that have only electric field strengthswithout the lorentz invariance .",
    "there are charges  coupling to these coulomb gauge fields , including quantum particles ( holons and spinons ) and external sources without quantum dynamics .",
    "the charge neutral  condition and the 2d coulomb interaction among the charged  objects lead to dual meissner effects : in the sc case , an external magnetic flux as an external source must be quantized , and in order to realize a minimal quantum @xmath314 a single spinon must be bound to such a magnetic flux to form a charge neutral  object ; in the aflro state , as an external source , a ( anti)meron is allowed as a topological excitation from the spinon condensate with a quantized winding number @xmath315 and a holon can not live alone and must be bound to such an external source to form a charge neutral  object with a spin dipolar configuration .",
    "finally we emphasize that the mutual - chern - simons theory in this work involves a mutual duality between the charge and spin degrees of freedom rather than a usual duality .",
    "a usual dual description has been also widely used @xcite in studying the doped mott insulators , which deals with an ordered phase and the transition to a disordered phase in terms of the corresponding topological defects on the dual lattice . in a conventional dual - theory description ,",
    "normally the af and sc phases are not directly related . by contrast , in the mutual duality discussed in the present theory , the vortices of one species ( holon / spinon ) under condensation are themselves quantum objects of another species ( spinon / holon ) , and _ two _ ordered phases , i.e. , af and sc states , can be naturally unified together @xcite . a similar duality at low",
    "doping has been also investigated @xcite by starting from the slave - fermion approach @xcite .",
    "based on the same phase string decomposition ( [ ps ] ) but with a slightly different mean - field decoupling ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a mutual duality between the af and sc states has been also discussed recently in ref .",
    "in this paper , we studied a new class of nontrivial ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge field structure - the mutual - chern - simons theory .",
    "the lagrangian of such a mutual - chern - simons theory is derived as an effective low - energy description of the phase - string model for doped mott insulators .",
    "this effective lagrangian retains the full symmetries of parity , time - reversal , and global su(2 ) spin rotation , in contrast to the conventional chern - simons theories where first two symmetries are usually broken .",
    "the mutual - chern - simons theory as a minimal model for doped mott insulators has a unique mutual duality structure .",
    "two ordered phases found in this theory , the af and sc states , are connected by dual meissner / flux quantization effects and dual confinement / deconfinement .",
    "namely , holons become vortices in the spinon condensed af phase and spinons become vortices in the holon condensed sc state .",
    "the former leads to the holon confinement ( a holon bound to a spin meron twist to form a neutral  dipolar structure ) and the latter leads to the spinon confinement and flux quantization ( a spinon bound to a magnetic flux quantized at @xmath25 to form a neutralobject in the holon condensate ) .",
    "such a mutual duality structure between the charge and spin degrees of freedom determines the essential competition between two degrees of freedom and provides driving forces for phase transitions to each other or to other disordered phases .",
    "dual confinement means that there is no true spin - charge separation is present in these ordered phases since one species ( spinon / holon ) is always confined at low temperatures while the other ( spinon / holon ) is condensed .",
    "but the dual deconfinement will play an essential role in the transitions to disordered phases or at the boundary between two ordered phases where a quantum critical point may exist kou , qcp .",
    "the systematic evolution of the phase diagram at low doping is currently under investigation based on the mutual - chern - simons lagrangian .    in the future we will also consider some additional relevant terms which have not been taken into consideration in the present _ minimal _ model .",
    "as previously shown @xcite , there generally exists a residual attractive interaction between holons and spinons within the @xmath5 model , which should be included when one considers the nodal ( d - wave ) fermionic quasiparticle excitations as collective  modes in the sc phase . in principle , besides spinon confinement , there also exists a holon - spinon confinement in the sc phase of the phase string model , since single spinon or holon excitation is not allowed @xcite .",
    "how the fermionic nodal quasiparticles can be naturally described in the mutual chern - simons framework will be a central issue to address in a next study , where the attractive interaction between holons and spinons beyond the phase string model should be properly incorporated in order to get a correct excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "we do not expect a qualitative modification on the present results of the minimal model by including such a term , since the quasiparticles as bound states of holons and spinons are independent , to leading order approximation , of those spinon excitations which are confined to form integer neutral spin excitaions discussed in the present work .",
