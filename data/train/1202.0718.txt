    "holm equation arises approximating the hamiltonian for the euler s equation in the shallow water regime .",
    "it is now a popular model for the propagation of unidirectional water waves over a flat bed .",
    "its hydrodynamical relevance has been pointed out in  @xcite , @xcite . in this",
    "setting , @xmath6 represents the horizontal velocity of the fluid motion at a certain depth .",
    "interesting mathematical properties of such equation include its bi - hamiltonian structure , the existence of infinitely many conserved integral quantities ( see  @xcite ) , and its geometric interpretation in terms of geodesic flows on the diffeomorphism group ( see  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another important feature of the camassa ",
    "holm equation is the existence of traveling solitary waves , interacting like solitons , also called  peakons \" due to their shape ( see @xcite ) : @xmath7 the peakons replicate a feature that is characteristic for the waves of great height , waves of largest amplitude that are exact solutions of the governing equations for irrotational water waves ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these solutions are orbitally stable : their shape is stable under small perturbations and therefore these waves are physically recognizable , see @xcite .",
    "let us recall that the cauchy problem associated with equation   is locally well - posed ( in the sense of hadamard ) in @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite for the periodic case ) , where the well - posedness is also established in slightly rougher spaces of besov type .",
    "there exist strong solutions to the camassa ",
    "holm equation that exist globally and strong solutions that blow up in finite time .",
    "several criteria can be given in order to establish whether or not an initially smooth solution develops a singularity after some time . for example , a.  constantin and j.  escher showed that the solution must blow up when the initial datum is odd with negative derivative at the origin , or when @xmath10 has in some point a slope that is less then @xmath11 . the same authors showed that the solution is global in time provided that the potential @xmath12 associated with the initial value  @xmath10 is a bounded measure with constant sign . these and many other important results have been surveyed by l.  molinet in  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the criterion on the potential was later improved by mckean  @xcite , who actually gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the global existence of the solution  @xmath13 , in terms of conditions on the sign of @xmath12 .",
    "the blowup mechanism of strong solutions is quite well understood : such solutions remain uniformly bounded up to the blowup time and a blowup occurs at a time @xmath14 if and only if @xmath15 .",
    "this phenomenon is also referred as wave breaking .    for @xmath16 ,",
    "the well - posedness of equation   in  @xmath17 is not known ( only counterexamples to the uniform well - posedness are available , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , existence and uniqueness results of weak solutions have been recently established also in spaces with low regularity .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the construction of weak solutions arising from  @xmath18-data .",
    "such studies are relevant also in connection with the continuation problem of solutions after the breakdown .",

    "a second motivation of such analysis is provided by the paper of himonas , misioek , ponce and zhou @xcite , and by the earlier work of escauriaza , kenig , ponce and vega , @xcite , @xcite on the unique continuation of solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations ( the schrdinger and the generalized @xmath24-generalized kdv equations ) : indeed , studying the spatial properties of the solution  @xmath13 at two different times provides simple criteria for @xmath13 to be identically zero .    in the case of the camassa ",
    "holm equations , only exponential weights @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( see  @xcite ) , or power weights @xmath27 with @xmath28 ( see  @xcite ) have been considered so far in the literature . moreover , such analysis was performed only in a weighted-@xmath29 setting : our class of weights allows us to give a unified approach and to cover also the case @xmath30 .",
    "the novel feature of our approach will be the systematic use of _ moderate weight functions_. moderate weights are a commonly used tool in time - frequency analysis , see , for example ,  @xcite , @xcite , but they have received little attention in connection with pdes , despite their rich harmonic analysis properties . as we shall see later on , in the case of the camassa ",
    "holm equations they lead to optimal results ( see theorem  [ theo2 ] , theorem  [ cor1 ] and its corollary ) . restricting to moderate weights",
    "is natural .",
    "indeed , the camassa ",
    "holm equation is invariant under spatial translations , and the weighted spaces @xmath31 are shift invariant if and only if @xmath22 is a moderate weight .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to establish the following blowup criterion : if the initial datum @xmath32 is such that @xmath33 then a wave breaking must occur at some time @xmath14 . in particular , a breakdown occurs when the initial datum satisfies @xmath34 for some @xmath35 .    the exponential decay assumption for @xmath10 and its derivative looks optimal , as the peakons @xmath36 are well - known global solutions to  .",
    "this second result improves the conclusion of  @xcite , where the authors showed that compactly supported data lead to a breakdown .",

    "more precisely , @xmath46 is @xmath47-moderate for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "we conclude that the pointwise decay @xmath93 as @xmath94 is conserved during the evolution .",
    "similarly , we have persistence of the decay @xmath93 as @xmath95 .",
