    "the precise determination of the machine luminosity is an important ingredient for the successful achievement of the physics programme at the @xmath1 colliders running with center of mass energy in the range of the low lying hadronic resonances ( 1 - 10 gev ) .",
    "one of the most important challenges is the precise measure of the @xmath3 ratio , by means of the energy scan or the radiative return method .",
    "the aim is to reduce the theoretical error on the hadronic contribution to the vacuum polarization , which will reflect on the error of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath4 and the qed coupling constant at the @xmath5 peak @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "actually , the @xmath3 measurement is going to become a precision measurement @xcite and it will give a stringent test of the standard model predictions .    in this perspective , a precise knowledge of the cross section for qed processes for luminometry , expecially for bhabha scattering , and their monte carlo ( mc ) simulation are crucial .",
    "the theoretical accuracy should be better than @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0 @xcite is a monte carlo event generator for the simulation of qed and @xmath2 processes at flavour factories .    in order to achieve an accurate prediction of the cross sections of the qed processes , the relevant radiative correction ( rc )",
    "have to be accounted for , and , in particular , photon radiation effects must be included in the calculation .",
    "the corrected cross section and the event generation can be obtained according to the following master formula ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath8 the previous equation is used in @xmath0 for the generation of the processes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the last channel has been recently implemented and , in this case , only photons coming from initial state are accounted for .    in eq .",
    "[ sezfs ] , the born - like cross section for the process @xmath13 is convoluted with the qed non - singlet structure functions ( sf s ) @xmath14 , which are the solution of the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite equation in qed @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the regularized altarelli - parisi vertex .",
    "the sf s in eq .",
    "[ sezfs ] account for photon radiation emitted by both initial - state ( isr ) and final - state ( fsr ) fermions .",
    "the sf s allow to include the universal virtual and real photonic corrections , up to all orders of perturbation theory . strictly speaking , radiation in eq .",
    "[ sezfs ] is collinear to the emitting fermions .",
    "it is possible to go beyond the collinear approximation by solving the dglap equation by means of a mc algorithm , the so - called parton shower algorithm ( ps ) , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "the parton shower is a mc algorithm which solves exactly the dglap equation ( see references in @xcite ) and it originates from an iterative solution of eq .",
    "[ qeddglap ] @xmath17 in eq .",
    "[ apitera ] , @xmath18 is the sudakov form factor , where the soft and virtual rc are exponentiated .",
    "the @xmath19 scale is not _ a priori _ fixed , but it has to be chosen in order to reproduce as close as possible the leading rc contributions coming from the exact order @xmath20 calculation .",
    "for example , for the bhabha scattering , a reasonable choice is @xmath21 , where @xmath22,@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the usual mandelstam variables and @xmath25 is the euler s number .",
    "the main advantage of this solution is that it keeps track of the number of the emitted photons and that their kinematics can be approximately recovered .",
    "therefore , the whole branching event can be generated and the multi - photon emission can be exclusively simulated .",
    "the generation of the photon s momenta has to be carefully considered . as suggested by eq .",
    "[ apitera ] , when the ps generates photons , their energy is extracted from the altarelli - parisi vertex @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the energy fraction remaining to the fermion after the photon emission .",
    "in order to generate also the angular variables , different solutions can be exploited @xcite , being those degrees of freedom integrated out in eqs .",
    "[ qeddglap ] and [ apitera ] .",
    "the first possible choice is to weight the photon angles according to the leading poles which are present in the radiation matrix element .",
    "namely , the photons angles can be distributed according to the following formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the momenta of the charged particles and @xmath30 is the momentum of the generic photon . if eq .",
    "[ leadingpole ] can be a first approximation , it is not so accurate when photonic variables are looked at closer . in order to improve the exclusive photon generation",
    ", we can observe that in eq .",
    "[ leadingpole ] the interference effects between isr and fsr are completely neglected , thus the fermions radiate independently .",
    "the radiation coherence effects can be included if we consider the cross section for the production of @xmath31 photons from a generic process involving fermions as external particles .",
    "taking the soft limit and keeping all the interference terms , the resulting formula is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are photons and fermions momenta and @xmath35 is a charge factor .",
    "the angular spectrum of the photons can be directly extracted from the eq .",
    "[ coherence ] .",
    "this highly enhances the reliability of the ps also in the simulation of radiative events , as will be shown in section [ pheno ] .",
