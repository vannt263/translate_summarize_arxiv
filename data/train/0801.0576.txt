    "[ eq : tc16 ] .",

    "[ eq : tc16 ] has been subject of much debate also .",

    "therefore in a practical sense , either dwell - time or phase - time are equivalent for sl scattering , at least for symmetric potentials .",
    "[ eq : tc20 ] shows that there are two situations where the channel coupling vanishes : at a maximum or minimum of transmission . in a sl , the number of maxima is @xmath71 , so as @xmath37 increases , these points of uncoupling become closer together .      in the transfer matrix method ,",
    "the wave functions are defined with a different phase than in usual scattering theory : we reset the phase to zero on each side ( @xmath72 ) of the potential array , rather than at an arbitrary origin . that makes @xmath14 translation invariant , so @xmath73 describes a periodic system without having to include a shift in the origin .",
    "adopting nussenzweig s notation @xmath74 $ ] for the asymptotic wave function to left and right @xcite , we compare our @xmath2 with the usual convention @xmath75 as follows : @xmath76   \\nonumber \\\\",
