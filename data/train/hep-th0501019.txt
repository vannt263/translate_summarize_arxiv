    "during last decade the integrable structures associated with conformal field theory ( cft ) and its @xmath0 extension were studied @xcite-@xcite . the main problem to which these papers were addressed is the simultaneous diagonalization of the corresponding infinite family of the integrals of motion ( i m ) .",
    "the method used for this purpose is the continuous version of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite .",
    "the most successful results were obtained by means of the generalization of the baxter s @xmath1-operator relation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will follow this way constructing the @xmath1-operator for analysis of the integrable structure arising in the superconformal field theory ( scft ) .",
    "this cft includes both usual left and right components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 , @xmath3 and spin-@xmath4 local fields @xmath5 , @xmath6 where variable @xmath7 lies on a cylinder of circumference @xmath8 .",
    "the full symmetry algebra of the theory is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 means superconformal algebra).we will concentrate here on the left - chiral component- sca .",
    "the boundary conditions are : @xmath11 where `` + '' corresponds to ramond ( r ) sector and ``  '' to neveu - schwarz ( ns ) one .",
    "the @xmath10 gives possibility to construct two infinite abelian families of conserved charges @xcite,@xcite,@xcite where one is susy invariant and the other is not .",
    "here we will consider the integrable structure invariant under the supersymmetry transformation . in the classical limit",
    "the corresponding i m give the hamiltonians of the susy @xmath12=1 kdv hierarchy @xcite based on twisted affine lie superalgebra @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the supertrace of the monodromy matrix of the associated l - operator in the 3-dimensional representation of @xmath14 ( see appendix 1 ) is a generating function for the i m .",
    "thus it s quantum generalization , the transfer matrix produces the i m of the scft .",
    "we will review some results from part i @xcite concerning the construction of the quantum counterpart of the monodromy matrix and it s basic properties in sec .",
    "2 . using the super q - oscillator representations of the upper borel subalgebra of quantum affine superalgebra @xmath15 we define the @xmath16 operators .",
    "the transfer matrices in different evaluation representations can be expressed in such a way : @xmath17 where @xmath18 runs over integer and half - integer nonnegative numbers .",
    "@xmath16 operators satisfy quantum super - wronskian relation : @xmath19 one should note , that we use only @xmath20-dimensional `` @xmath21-induced '' representations ( sometimes called atypical ) of @xmath14 .",
    "it allows , however , to construct the fusion relations , see below . to construct the baxter - like relation we introduce additional `` quarter''-operators , constructed `` by hands '' from the @xmath1-operators : @xmath22 for odd integer @xmath23 .",
    "the baxter s relations are : @xmath24 @xmath25 the fusion relations have the following form very similar to the @xmath26 case @xcite : @xmath27 but these relations are only `` fusion - like '' because the `` quarter''-operators do not seem to correspond to any representation of @xmath14 .",
    "this will be the subject of sec .",
    "3 . finally in sec .",
    "4 we describe the truncation of these relations for different values of @xmath28 , being root of unity .",
    "in the part i @xcite we have explicitly constructed the quantum counterpart of the monodromy matrix of the linear problem for the l - operator of the susy n=1 kdv equation .",
    "this l - operator has the following explicit form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the chevalley generators of @xmath14 ( see appendix 1 ) , @xmath33 is a superderivative , the variable @xmath7 lies on a cylinder of circumference @xmath8 , @xmath34 is a grassmann variable , @xmath35 is a bosonic superfield .",
    "the poisson brackets for the field @xmath36 , obtained by means of the drinfeld - sokolov reduction are : @xmath37 and the following boundary conditions are imposed on the components of @xmath36 : @xmath38 , @xmath39 . making a gauge transformation of the auxiliary linear problem we obtain a new superfield @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 generate the superconformal algebra under the poisson brackets : @xmath43 the corresponding infinite series of the integrals of motion @xcite : @xmath44 allows us to construct integrable evolution equations . for example",
    "@xmath45 yields the susy n=1 kdv equation @xcite : @xmath46 which has the following form in components : @xmath47 these integrals of motion ( [ i m ] ) can be extracted from the monodromy matrix of the l - operator ( [ lop])@xcite : @xmath48 \\big).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it s quantum generalization can be represented in the quantum p - exponent form ( for the explanation of this notion see below ) : @xmath49 vertex operators @xmath50 have the following form @xmath51 , where : @xmath52=\\frac{i}{2}\\beta^2 , \\quad   [ a_n , a_m]=\\frac{\\beta^2}{2}n\\delta_{n+m,0},\\qquad \\{\\xi_n,\\xi_m\\}=\\beta^2\\delta_{n+m,0}.\\nonumber\\\\ & & : e^{\\pm\\phi(u)}:= \\exp\\big(\\pm\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{a_{-n}}{n}e^{inu}\\big ) \\exp\\big(\\pm i(q+pu)\\big)\\exp\\big(\\mp\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{a_{n}}{n}e^{-inu } \\big)\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 satisfy the following properties : @xmath53 these relations gave us possibility to show that the reduced universal r - matrix of the quantum affine superalgebra @xmath54 ( see appendix 1 ) with lower borel subalgebra represented by operators @xmath55 have the p - exponent multiplication property @xcite .",
    "thus we have called it the quantum p - exponent : @xmath56 the universal r - matrix represented by @xmath55 coincide with @xmath57 .",
    "note , that the monodromy matrix is : @xmath58 unlike the cases of quantum ( super)algebra @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xcite-@xcite , @xcite this object ca nt be represented in the usual p - ordered form due to the singularities arising from the products of fermion free fields .",
    "however as in all these cases @xmath63 which we will denote in the following as @xmath64 to simplify the notation satisfy the rtt - relation @xcite , @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath18 , @xmath66 means that the corresponding object is considered in some representation of @xmath54 .",
    "thus the supertraces of monodromy matrix ( `` transfer matrices '' ) @xmath67 commute .",
    "it is very useful to consider the evaluation representations of @xmath54 , @xmath68 , where now symbol @xmath18 means integer and half - integer numbers ( see appendix 1 ) . denoting @xmath69 as @xmath70",
    "we find that @xmath71 commute : @xmath72=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expansion of @xmath73 in @xmath74 ( the transfer matrix in the fundamental 3-dimensional representation ) is believed to give us as coefficients the local i m , the quantum counterparts of ( [ i m ] ) : @xmath75 where the densities @xmath76 are differential polynomials of @xmath2 and @xmath5 such that @xmath77 terms with derivatives .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath5 have the following representation in terms of free fields ( [ freefields ] ) ( see @xcite ) : @xmath78 one of the basic features of the i m is that their commutators with certain vertex operators reduce to total derivatives @xcite : @xmath79=\\partial_u(:o^{(k)}_{\\pm}(u )   w_{\\pm}(u):)=\\partial_u\\theta^{(k)}_{\\pm}(u)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath80 is the polynomial of @xmath81 , @xmath82 and their derivatives ) . by means of this important property one can show ( see @xcite ) that such integrals commute with the transfer matrices : @xmath83=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our case it is also important to show that the generator of the supersymmetry transformation @xmath84 commutes with @xmath85 .",
    "really , @xmath86=\\pm i^{1/2}\\partial_u : e^{\\pm\\phi(u)}:=\\partial_u\\xi^{\\pm}(u ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath87 can be included in the family of i m and using again the results of @xcite it is easy to show that @xmath88=0 .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "let s consider evaluation representations @xmath68 of the quantum algebra @xmath54 which we have already mentioned in the introduction and in previous section .",
    "they are @xmath20 dimensional where @xmath18 runs over integer and half - integer numbers .",
    "we call these representations `` @xmath89-induced '' because each triple @xmath90 and @xmath91 form @xmath89 superalgebra @xcite , and @xmath20-dimensional representation space is a representation space for each @xmath89 subalgebra irreducible representation ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "+ we will also use in the following the corresponding reducible infinite - dimensional representations @xmath92 , which look like @xmath89 verma representations for the @xmath90 triple . to simplify the notation",
    "we denote @xmath93 as @xmath94 and @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "+ in order to construct the @xmath1-operator we introduce the auxiliary object , the super q - oscillator algebra @xcite with the following commutation relations : @xmath97=\\pm\\varepsilon_{\\pm } , \\qquad q^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\varepsilon_{+ } \\varepsilon_{-}+q^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\varepsilon_{-}\\varepsilon_{+}=\\frac{1}{q - q^{-1}}.\\ ] ] using these relations it is possible to build realization for the upper borel subalgebra @xmath98 generated by @xmath99 : @xmath100 and we denote @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "next , following @xcite we define two operators which do not depend on representation of oscillator algebra but depend on ( and completely determined by ) the commutation relations and cyclic property of the supertrace : @xmath103 where @xmath104 multiplying two @xmath105 operators we arrive to such a result ( see appendix 2 ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the supertrace of the monodromy matrix in @xmath92 representation .",
    "defining then the @xmath1-operators : @xmath108 we find that the expression ( [ aa ] ) can be written in such a form : @xmath109 now let s recall that @xmath107 corresponds to infinite - dimensional representation @xmath110 . in order to obtain the transfer matrix corresponding to the finite - dimensional representation @xmath111 one should consider factor - representation + @xmath110/@xmath112 ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "thus one obtains : @xmath113 sign + in this formula appears because of taking a supertrace .",
    "really , @xmath114 subrepresentation in @xmath110 representation space has a highest weight vector which is odd ( though",
    "our convention is that highest weight vector in @xmath115 representation is even ( see appendix 1 ) ) .",
    "that s why we have sign + instead of the usual . + rewriting ( [ ttt ] ) in terms of the @xmath16 operators we find : @xmath116 considering the case of 1-dimensional representation of @xmath54 ( @xmath117 ) we obtain a quantum super - wronskian ( qsw ) relation : @xmath118 in order to construct the baxter type relation @xcite we introduce the auxiliary `` quarter '' operators : @xmath119 for odd integer @xmath23 .",
    "let s consider the @xmath120 operator and multiply it on @xmath121 operators .",
    "using ( [ sw ] ) one can get the following relation of baxter type , which is similar to that one obtained in @xmath26 case @xcite : @xmath122",
    "the main difference is that unlike the @xmath26 case we are not seeking for the eigenvalues of @xmath120 operator but we are interested in the operator corresponding to the 3-dimensional representation , @xmath123 , because we know that it is a generating function of the local i m @xcite .",
    "thus we are looking for the relation of baxter type which includes this operator . + in order to do this we need to proceed through some additional steps .",
    "first , let s unify the expressions ( [ tq ] ) , ( [ quarter ] ) : @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "using the qsw relation it is not hard to obtain the expressions for @xmath85 operators only in terms of @xmath127 or @xmath128 : @xmath129 for example for @xmath123 we obtain the `` triple relation '' : @xmath130 due to the unifying relation ( [ utq ] ) and using again ( [ sw ] ) we find the fusion relations : @xmath131 however , as we already mentioned in the introduction these relations are different from fusion relations obtained for ( super)algebras @xmath26 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) in the sense that in all these cases operators present in the fusion relation correspond to the representations of the associated algebras . in our case",
    "we see that artificially constructed auxiliary quarter operators do not correspond to any representation of @xmath54",
    ". + let s write the fusion relations for @xmath135 with @xmath74 multiplied on @xmath136 : @xmath137 multiplying both sides on @xmath121 we obtain second relation of baxter type : @xmath138",
    "though the baxter @xmath1-operator method is very powerful there exists another approach which is useful for rational values of the central charge @xcite , it is the scft counterpart of baxter s commuting transfer matrix method . in this section",
    "we will show that when q is the root of unity the system of fusion relations becomes finite .",
    "so , let s put @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141",
    ". then @xmath142 here @xmath125 , @xmath143 .",
    "note also that @xmath144 with the use of such a transform one obtains : @xmath145 recalling the formula ( [ tq ] ) for @xmath146 we arrive to the following expression : @xmath147 for example for @xmath117 we obtain : @xmath148 using the basic formula ( [ tq ] ) and property ( [ mon ] ) @xmath149 and for @xmath150 one arrives to the following relations : @xmath151 @xmath152 comparing ( [ n/2 ] ) and ( [ n/2 - 1/2 ] ) we obtain the following simple formula : @xmath153 in the case when @xmath154 , where @xmath155 , @xmath156 there exist additional number of truncations : @xmath157 the relation ( [ trunc ] ) allows us to to rewrite the fusion relation system in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations @xcite of @xmath158 type as in @xmath26 case @xcite : @xmath159 with the use of identification : @xmath160 where we have denoted @xmath161 the eigenvalue of @xmath85 .",
    "in this paper we studied algebraic relations arising from integrable structure of cft provided by the susy @xmath12=1 kdv hierarchy . as it was already mentioned in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the construction of the @xmath1-operator as a `` transfer''-matrix corresponding to the infinite - dimensional q - oscillator representation could be also applied to the lattice models .",
    "the relations like baxter s and fusion ones will be also valid in the lattice case because they depend only on the decomposition properties of the representations .",
    "+ the use of supersymmetry in the considered model is that the limit of @xmath162 when @xmath163 is very simple due to the expansion @xcite : @xmath164 where @xmath165 , @xmath166 for @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the integrals of motion of the susy @xmath12=1 kdv .",
    "thus @xmath169 .",
    "we hope that such a nice result remains valid in the quantum case .",
    "maybe this conjecture will give us possibility to simplify the study of the analytic properties of the eigenvalues of @xmath170 , @xmath1 operators and therefore the corresponding integral equations of destri - de vega type @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will consider these questions in the third part of our manuscript @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to consider the obtained tba equations ( [ tba ] ) in the context of the perturbed minimal models as it was done in @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we also plan to study the quantization of @xmath171 susy kdv hierarchies , related with super - w conformal / topological integrable field theories .",
    "we are grateful to f.a .",
    "smirnov for useful discussions .",
