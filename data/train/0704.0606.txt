    "atom optics is `` basically the development and perfection of techniques and devices which can manipulate the atom waves coherently '' @xcite .",
    "many of these devices ( lenses , mirrors , beam splitters ) have their origin in standard light optics , and others are influenced by electronics : this has lead to the idea of guiding the atoms in atomic circuits and developing circuit control elements .",
    "we have proposed in particular , in analogy with the electronic diode , an `` atom diode '' @xcite , a laser device which combines state - selective mirrors and pumping lasers to let the neutral atom in its ground state pass in one direction ( conventionally from left to right ) , but not in the opposite direction for a range of incident velocities .",
    "similar ideas have been put forward independently by raizen and coworkers @xcite who proposed one - way barriers to implement a new laser cooling technique sweeping them across an atomic trap .",
    "the near possibility of an experimental implementation has motivated a recent analysis on the effect of quenching lasers to improve the diode performance @xcite , as well as the present work , which investigates three dimensional ( 3d ) effects that had been ignored so far , and the way to overcome them .",
    "the original models have been one - dimensional , which is appropriate for tight lateral confinement in wave guides or cigar shaped traps , but for general geometries , and in particular for flat laser sheets and arbitrary incidence angles , three dimensional effects may become important as we shall see . as a further motivation ,",
    "consider an interesting application of the atom diode shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , namely a realization of maxwell s pressure demon @xcite : starting with a box of atoms at random positions we put an atom diode in the middle ( the direction of transmission is indicated by an arrow ) . after some time",
    ", all atoms will be on the right - hand side of the box provided that the diode works independently of atomic velocity and incident angle .    a version of maxwell s demon : the atom diode would achieve a differential of pressure as an inanimate one - way valve , by letting atoms cross in one direction but not in the opposite one . ]",
    "the paper begins with an analysis of the @xmath0-level diode in sec .",
    "ii , and sec .",
    "iii discusses the @xmath1-level diode : this is a worthwhile complication since it provides a simple physical realization of the former case with just two lasers by adiabatic elimination .    throughout the paper , flat laser sheets",
    "are assumed to extend in the @xmath2-plane with some thickness in @xmath3-direction , and laser wave - vectors point in @xmath4-direction .",
    "because of translational symmetry in @xmath5-direction and the corresponding conservation of @xmath5-momentum , this coordinate will be ignored hereafter .",
    "atom diode based on @xmath0 levels plus quenching : ( a , b ) schematic action of the different lasers on the atom levels , ( c ) location of the different laser potentials in @xmath3 direction , and ( d ) setting in the @xmath6 plane . ]",
    "the basic setting for a two - level atom diode can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]c , and consists of three , partially overlapping , interaction regions : in the external ones , state - selective mirrors block the excited ( @xmath7 ) and ground ( @xmath8 ) state atoms , respectively ; in the central pumping region , a laser , possibly detuned with respect to the atomic transition with detuning @xmath9 ( the difference between the pumping laser frequency and atomic transition frequency @xmath10 between levels 1 and 2 ) couples the two levels .",
    "the pumping laser has a wave vector of modulus @xmath11 in @xmath4 direction and the rabi frequency is @xmath12 .",
    "the detuning , which is a novel feature with respect to our previous work , plays an important role in 3d as we shall see . in principle it is possible to implement this scheme with three different lasers , one for each region , nevertheless a simpler realization relies on just two lasers appropriately detuned and a stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage @xcite ) process , this case is worked out in sec .",
    "iii as a generalization of the results discussed in @xcite .",
    "the explanation of the diodic behavior is the following ( see fig . [",
    "fig2]c ) : if the ground - state atom travels from the right to left and its velocity is not too high , it is reflected by the state - selective mirror potential @xmath13 and returns to the right . if the atom travels from the left in the ground state , it will cross the potential @xmath14 , be pumped to the second level and pass to the right unaffected by the potential @xmath13 . it might seem that @xmath15 plays no role but , if it is removed , the transmittance @xmath16 from the left drops dramatically @xcite .",
    "the role and importance of the state - selective mirror potentials is thus not reduced to blocking .",
    "their presence is essential to facilitate an adiabatic rightwards transfer of population from state 1 to state 2 @xcite .",
    "this makes the device quite robust and insensitive to shape or parameter variations , in particular reflection and transmission probabilities become in 1d flat functions of the velocity for broad intervals . in 3d",
    ", these intervals will in general also depend on the incidence angle , but later we shall show that this dependence can be suppressed using an appropriate detuning .    for many applications , the atom should decay irreversibly back to the ground state after crossing the three regions to avoid any backwards motion from right to left .",
    "the decay can occur naturally or be forced by an additional quenching laser pumping the atom to a third state which decays to the ground state with a fast rate @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "the quenching laser interaction is characterized by a wave vector of modulus @xmath18 in @xmath4 direction , rabi frequency @xmath19 , and detuning @xmath20 ( difference between the laser frequency and the transition frequency @xmath21 ) .",
    "the atom dynamics corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can be described by a master equation or equivalently by the quantum jump formalism @xcite . however , to determine the working conditions of the diode , it is enough to examine the evolution until the first spontaneous decay of the atom , since , with the chosen laser configuration , it is extremely unlikely that there will be more than one spontaneous decay .",
    "this evolution is described by an effective schrdinger - equation dynamics in the quantum jump approach . using the rotating - wave approximation , and in a laser adapted interaction picture such that the hamiltonian is time independent , the corresponding effective hamiltonian is @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the momentum operator components in @xmath6 space , and @xmath28 is the mass ( corresponding to neon in all numerical examples ) . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the effective reflecting potentials . their dependence on @xmath3 only ( and not on @xmath4 ) is justified in the appendix for a three - laser realization of the 2-level diode , and in section iii for a two - laser realization .",
    "we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( we assume @xmath35 ) .",

    "[ fig2]a and determine the optimal working conditions for which atoms coming from the right are reflected and atoms from the left are transmitted",
    ". then we shall study the quenching laser alone , as in fig.[fig2]b , and finally combine everything .",
