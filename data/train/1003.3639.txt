    "carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the galaxy ( after h , he , and o ) , but has not yet been exploited as an x - ray photoabsorption diagnostic .",
    "it presents a special challenge for x - ray transmission spectroscopy .",
    "x - ray instruments often employ visible / uv light blocking filters based on carbon compounds that are robust to space deployment .",
    "these filters imprint strong c k - edge absorption signatures on x - ray spectra , rendering difficult the disentanglement of weaker astrophysical absorption features .",
    "the task is hampered further still by a current lack of data describing the expected absorption edge structure and resonances for neutral and ionized c.    in order to investigate c absorption features , we perform detailed r - matrix calculations of the k - shell photoabsorption cross - sections of - .",
    "these cross sections are then used to interpret the x - ray spectra from a high - quality _ chandra _ observation of the blazar mkn  421 and determine relative carbon - ion abundances .",
    "the specific processes of interest are the k - shell photoexcitation of the carbon - ion ground state , @xmath4 followed by two competing decay routes .",
    "first , there is _ participator _ auger decay @xmath5 where the valence electron @xmath6 takes part in the autoionization process ; the decay width therefore scales as @xmath7 and goes to zero near the k - shell threshold .",
    "there is also the more important _ spectator _ auger decay @xmath8 where the valence electron @xmath6 does not take part in the autoionization process , giving instead a decay width that is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "spectator auger decay is therefore the dominant decay route as @xmath10 and gives a smooth cross section as the k - shell threshold is approached ; above each threshold , k - shell photoionization to the @xmath11 states occurs instead .",
    "we note that for @xmath12 , there is no distinction between spectator and participator channels .    to account for photoionization to the participator channels , we use the standard r - matrix method @xcite and expand the total wavefunction in a basis consisting of free electron orbitals @xmath13 coupled to each of the ground - state and singly - excited @xmath14 target wavefunctions , plus bound orbitals @xmath6 coupled to the k - shell vacancy target wavefunctions @xmath11 .",
    "however , the infinite number of @xmath15 spectator decay channels are impossible to include implicitly in such an r - matrix expansion ; instead , they are accounted for via an optical potential approach  @xcite .",
    "the target energy for each closed channel @xmath16 is modified within a multi - channel quantum defect theory approach as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 auger width .",
    "this enhanced r - matrix method was shown to be successful in describing experimental synchrotron measurements for @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and chandra high - resolution spectroscopic observations for oxygen ions @xcite and neon ions @xcite .",
    "we compute the @xmath11 auger widths by applying the smith time - delay method  @xcite to the photoabsorption r - matrix calculation of the neighboring @xmath14 carbon ion . since @xmath2 photoabsorption of the @xmath14 ion gives an intermediate @xmath11 resonance , the subsequent auger decay to the @xmath20 channel can be analyzed to obtain the auger width .",
    "it is also important to obtain accurate target wavefunctions using a single orthogonal orbital basis , and this is problematic since orbital relaxation occurs when the @xmath14 states are excited to the @xmath11 k - shell - vacancy states ( the @xmath21 electrons are now only screened by one , not two , @xmath22 electrons )",
    ". we account for orbital relaxation by using additional pseudoorbitals as follows .",
    "a basis of physical @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 orbitals is first constructed by performing hartree - fock calculations for the @xmath14 ground states .",
    "then multiconfiguration hartree - fock ( mchf ) calculations  @xcite are performed for the @xmath11 k - shell - excited states , including all configurations obtained from single and double promotions to the @xmath25 shell , to obtain @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 pseudoorbitals .",
    "all target states are then described by a configuration - interaction ( ci ) expansion using all configurations consistent with single and double promotions out of the @xmath14 and @xmath11 states , using the six @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 orbitals .",

    "the energy of this state corresponds to the k - shell threshold in the photoabsorption of and was measured to be @xmath30  ev by @xcite , which is in good agreement with our predicted value of 296.096 ev .",
    "given target wavefunctions , we construct total wavefunctions by coupling an additional electron orbital .",

    "were able to make preliminary identifications of the @xmath33 resonances in the vicinity of the k - edge .",
    "however , it should be stressed that experimental data on atomic carbon that does exists in the literature was obtained at very low resolution and performed using the dual laser plasma ( dlp ) technique as pioneered by @xcite .",
    "the dual plasma technique is useful for obtaining absorption spectra over a wide energy range @xcite .",
    "their interpretation , however , can be extremely complicated due to ions being distributed over various charge states in both the ground and metastable - states , and the presence of a plasma can affect energy levels , as can post - collision interactions ( pci ) .",
    "theoretical cross - sections are available in the literature from the independent - particle ( ip ) model @xcite that include the direct photoionization continuum ( but not the @xmath0 resonance contributions ) as does the scaled hydrogenic work of @xcite .",
    "ab initio work has also been carried out using the r - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed r - matrix calculations on this complex at energies above the hole states included in their work .",
    "no resonance structure was obtained in their work , since they were mainly interested in determining the shake up process ( 2s @xmath34 2p and 3s , and 2p @xmath34",
    "3p excitations ) in the photon energy range 25 to 45 rydbergs , i.e. @xmath35 340 ev to 612 ev , which is well above the carbon k - edge .",
    "they conclude that the 2s @xmath34 3s excitation dominates the shake up process and is about a factor of 2 smaller than in the case of boron @xcite .",
    "in addition the 2s shake off process ( at most 20% ) would lead to the production of 1s@xmath36 hole states which can then auger decay only to civ 1s@xmath372p .",
    "in contrast to this , the r - matrix work of @xcite catered for resonances in the vicinity of the carbon k - edge and showed strong resonance structure which was missing from various other theoretical approaches .",

    "ip results are also shown in fig .  [ cpa ] , which are seen to be in good agreement with our r - matrix cross section above the k - shell threshold .",
    "our computed @xmath29 k - shell threshold at 296.10 ev is in good agreement with the experimentally observed values of 296.2@xmath380.5 ev by  @xcite and 296.07@xmath380.2 ev by  @xcite and with the theoretical value of 296.02 ev from a uhf - scf approximation .",
    "the discontinuity around 291.6 ev in the r - matrix results is due to the turn - off of auger broadening below @xmath25 to prevent double counting of the auger width of the @xmath12 resonance ( the @xmath39 resonances only decay to participator channels ) .",

    ".    for , there also exist experimental and earlier r - matrix results , but only for the @xmath2 resonances @xcite . in that experiment ,",
    "in addition to the @xmath43 ground state , there was a @xmath44% @xmath45 metastable - state fraction , giving additional resonances not included in our calculations for fig  [ ciipa ] .",
    "thus we performed an additional r - matrix photoabsorption calculation from the metastable state , including all quartet , rather than doublet , total symmetries , and then added the ground and metastable cross sections together with weightings of 80% and 20% , respectively .",

    "for the two strongest @xmath46 and @xmath47 resonances , where the experimental resolution was 65 mev , we find good agreement with the experimental resonance positions , but both present and earlier r - matrix resonance strengths are found to be significantly greater than the measured strengths .",
    "the second set of experimental results was taken at 120 mev for the weaker resonances , and here we find that our resonance positions are in error by as much as 0.5 ev and our strengths are again greater than experiment .",

    "_ chandra _ has observed mkn  421 on several different occasions , but one observation made by the letg+hrc - s on 2003 july 1 - 2 ( obsid 4149 ) caught the object in a particularly bright state and is of much higher quality .",
    "the observation and data are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we retrieved standard pipeline - processed products from the _ chandra _ archive and constructed effective areas for the overlapping spectral orders 1 - 10 using standard ciao tasks .",
    "subsequent analysis was performed using the interactive data language - based package for interactive analysis of line emission ( pintofale ; * ? ? ?",
    "the adopted continuum model was optimized to the region around the c  k - edge , ignoring the absorption edge structure . a power law continuum with photon index @xmath57 and interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption corresponding to a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath58  @xmath59 computed using the cross sections of @xcite",
    "were adopted .",
    "these values are close ( but not identical ) to the values found by @xcite ; small differences can be ascribed to our optimization to the c  k - edge region and to revisions in the instrument calibration between their and our analyses .",
    "while we could obtain a good match to the observations over the continuum regions around the c  k - edge , this model systematically underpredicted the data in the 42 - 44    range by about 5 - 15% .",
    "we ascribe this to uncertainty in the calibration  a notoriously difficult task for x - ray instruments in the vicinity of the c  k - edge .",
    "we applied a smooth broad gaussian - like correction to the effective area in order to ameliorate this effect .",
    "the resulting model fit is illustrated in figure  [ jdfig ] . while the fit is generally very good , there is a clear discrepancy near 43   .",
    "the  @xcite cross section for carbon is essentially that from the synthesis of @xcite combined with the c abundance of @xcite , and amounts to a simple step - function .",

    "the resulting model spectrum folded through the instrument response is also illustrated in figure  [ jdfig ] .",
    "there are no obvious signs of significant absorption in the data .",
    "we do not place great weight on the c ion ratios used for the fit : the instrument calibration would appear to require some revision before quantitative measurements can be made . however , we especially note two aspects of the results .",
    "firstly , the resonance structure now provides a good match to the observations in the vicinity of 43  and we consider this a reliable detection of this species . to our knowledge , this represents the first x - ray identification of absorption in interstellar gas .",
    "secondly , there is a weak absorption feature near 42.15    in the observed spectrum that is reasonably close to the @xmath60 resonance predicted by our r - matrix calculations .",
    "the offset between the two is @xmath61   or 0.35  ev .",
    "based on the comparison of the r - matrix resonance energy and synchrotron observations illustrated in figure  [ jdfig ] , an offset of 0.35  ev is much too large to be associated with uncertainties in the predicted resonance position .",
    "instead , it is possible that hrc - s imaging non - linearities could give rise to such a discrepancy .",
    "line positions are generally expected to be better than 0.01 - 0.02   , but can occasionally be as far as 0.05    out of place .",
    "we stop short of identifying this absorption feature but draw attention to its possible interest for future study .",
    "photoabsorption features of carbon ions ( -iv ) ) are studied using the r - matrix method , yielding , detailed information on the carbon k - shell photoabsorption cross section spectra .",
    "furthermore , we computed photoabsorption cross sections for the additional , , and isonuclear members , for which synchrotron - facility measurements at the als and theoretical studies already studied the lowest @xmath62 resonance transitions .",
    "our computed resonance positions were within about 0.5 ev of the measured values , and our strengths showed good agreement for some of the resonances but were significantly too large or small , compared to experiment , for certain strong resonances .",
    "these computed data are of particular importance for absorption studies of cosmic gas . in turn",
