    "proposition  [ lemma : val - increase ] below shows that it is sufficient to prove that  @xmath23 , where + @xmath24 .",
    "it is classical that the numerator and denominator of the convergents of a continued fraction are related to the coefficients  @xmath25 through a linear recurrence : @xmath26    in view of  , it follows that for all  @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the valuation of  @xmath29 is that of its numerator @xmath30 using   to rewrite  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 in terms of  @xmath33 , @xmath34 , it follows that any shift  @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) can be rewritten as a linear combination of @xmath37 for  @xmath38 and  @xmath39 in  @xmath40 .",
    "there are finitely many such terms , which implies that a linear dependency between  @xmath41 ( ie , a linear recurrence for  @xmath42 ) can be computed directly from   by linear algebra .",

    "starting with the differential equation  , this method produces and proves automatically the general term of the famous continued fraction @xmath49 that was the basis of lambert s proof that  @xmath50 is irrational .",
    "the transformation of the large recurrence   into the shorter one   makes it possible to prove automatically that the valuations  @xmath51 increase with  @xmath7 .",
    "this transformation turns out to play a role in most of the examples dealt with in our experiments .",
    "it is actually of more general interest : the closure properties enjoyed by the class of d - finite series or p - recursive sequences give rise to operators satisfied by products or sums of zeroes of such operators  @xcite .",
    "these operators annihilate all possible cases and are potentially of large size , while operators of smaller order may exist for the specific solution of interest .",

    "it is described here in the case of recurrence operators ; similar variants apply to differential or  @xmath0-difference cases .",
    "the search for a smaller order operator is performed in two main steps , `` guessing '' and `` proving '' .",
    "first , the input recurrence of order  @xmath65 and its initial values are used to compute the first  @xmath64 terms of the sequence .",
    "next , these  @xmath64 terms are used to `` guess '' a linear recurrence .",
    "this is done by linear algebra : we search successively for the existence of a linear recurrence operator  @xmath66 of order  @xmath67 with polynomial coefficients of degrees such that the sum of the numbers of undetermined coefficients of the recurrence is smaller than  @xmath64 .",
    "the structure of this linear algebra problem is exploited by computing matrix rational interpolants  @xcite ( in the differential case , hermite - pad approximants are used  @xcite ) .    when  @xmath64 is sufficiently large , this linear algebra phase is always successful , since it can reconstruct  @xmath52 .",
    "the next step is to prove that the recurrence  @xmath66 obtained from the first  @xmath64 terms of  @xmath56 defines the same sequence for all  @xmath7 . the operator  @xmath66 is not necessarily a right factor of  @xmath52 , but could be merely a left multiple of such a right factor , the factor itself being too large to be found with  @xmath64 terms only .",
    "this is related to the typical shape of the order - degree curve  @xcite .",
    "thus the algorithm next computes the greatest common right divisor of  @xmath66 and  @xmath52 and its numerator  @xmath68 , obtained by left - multiplication with the least common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients .    at this stage ,",
    "the algorithm has produced a right factor  @xmath68 of  @xmath52 .",
    "it is then associated initial conditions  @xmath69 , with which @xmath68 defines a sequence  @xmath70[n]{}$ ] .",
    "we now prove that if @xmath71 for  @xmath72 , then @xmath71 for all @xmath7 .",
    "the induction on @xmath7 is based on the following .    if @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for all @xmath76 then @xmath77 .    the sequences @xmath78 all cancel at @xmath79 .",
    "the application of @xmath52 at @xmath80 is a linear combination of them with coefficients that are finite , as shown in the next lemma , so that @xmath81 is 0 at @xmath79 .",

    "note however that if  @xmath52 is not irreducible , then increasing  @xmath64 further is bound to find a nontrivial right factor .",
    "the first step of our approach to continued fractions is the automatic discovery of formulas for the partial numerators  @xmath95 .",
    "this section is very short since this part of the computation is straightforward .",
    "starting from the differential equation , a first method would be to produce the first terms of the series expansion of the function , convert them into the first terms of the continued fraction and then use the method of the previous section to look for a linear recurrence of size bounded by the number of terms that have been computed .",
    "it turns out that in most of the known examples , explicit formulas are of rational form ( see section  [ sec : expe ] ) .",
    "we therefore concentrate on rational coefficients , or on interlacing of rational coefficients as in the example of the exponential function .",
    "this means that the `` guessing '' stage of our approach relies simply on rational interpolation , problem for which efficient algorithms are known through its relation to the extended euclidean algorithm  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the degrees of the numerator and denominator are generally low , so that a few terms of the expansion are sufficient for the computation .",
    "the proving phase is the heart of our work .",

    "in particular , the case  @xmath99 corresponds to the classical riccati equations that are ubiquitous in the study of continued fractions , due to their stability under linear fractional transformations of the unknown function  @xcite .",
    "explicit solutions for restricted classes of equations have been provided by euler and lagrange and more recently by khovanskii  @xcite .",
    "our procedure goes in the reverse direction .",
    "the continued fraction with explicit rational coefficients that was found in the previous stage defines a power series .",
    "the aim is to show that it is a solution of the differential equation .",
