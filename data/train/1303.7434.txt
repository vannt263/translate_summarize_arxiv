    "in the last decade , there have been a number of studies of systems in which the states of individuals and the connections between them coevolve , see @xcite .",
    "the systems considered include evolutionary games @xcite@xcite and epidemics @xcite@xcite , but here we will concentrate on the spread of opinions @xcite@xcite .",
    "different from the models of cascades @xcite@xcite which are also widely used in the study of opinion spread , the evolving voter model we study here allows an agent to switch between different opinions and the network topology to change accordingly , yet we assume that agents impose equal influence over each other ( cf . , multi - state complex contagions @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this model provides building blocks to quantitatively study collective behaviors in various social systems , e.g. , segregation of a population into two or more communities with different political opinions , religious beliefs , cultural traits , etc .",
    "we are particularly interested here in systems that generalize the model proposed by holme and newman @xcite . in their model",
    "there is a network of @xmath5 vertices and @xmath6 edges .",
    "the individual at vertex @xmath7 has an opinion @xmath8 from a set of @xmath9 possible opinions and the number of people per opinion @xmath10 stays bounded as @xmath5 gets large . on each step of the process",
    ", a vertex @xmath0 is picked at random .",
    "if its degree @xmath11 equals @xmath12 , nothing happens .",
    "if @xmath13 , ( i ) then with probability @xmath14 a random neighbor @xmath1 of @xmath0 is selected and we set @xmath15 ; ( ii ) otherwise ( i.e. , with probability @xmath3 ) an edge attached to vertex @xmath0 is selected and the other end of that edge is moved to a vertex chosen at random from those with opinion @xmath16 . this process continues until the ` consensus time ' @xmath17 , at which there are no longer any discordant edges  that is , there are no edges connecting individuals with different opinions .    for @xmath18 ,",
    "only rewiring steps occur , so once all of the @xmath6 edges have been touched , the graph has been disconnected into @xmath9 components , each consisting of individuals who share the same opinion . since",
    "none of the opinions have changed , the components of the final graph are all small ( i.e. , their sizes are poisson with mean @xmath19 ) . by classical results for the coupon collector s problem",
    ", this requires @xmath20 updates , see e.g. , page 57 in @xcite . in the case of sparse graphs we consider here @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) so the number of steps is @xmath23 , i.e. , when @xmath5 is large it will be @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath25 this system reduces to the voter model on a static graph .",
    "if we suppose that the initial graph is an erds - rnyi random graph in which each vertex has average degree @xmath26 , then ( see e.g. , chapter 2 of @xcite ) there is a `` giant component '' that contains a positive fraction , @xmath27 , of the vertices and the second largest component is small having only @xmath28 vertices",
    ". the voter model on the giant component will reach consensus in @xmath29 steps ( see , e.g. , section 6.9 of @xcite ) , so the end result is that one opinion has @xmath30 followers while all of the other groups are small .    using simulation and finite size scaling , holme and",
    "newman showed that there is a critical value @xmath31 so that for @xmath32 all of the opinions have a small number of followers at the end of the process , while for @xmath33 `` a giant community of like - minded individuals forms . ''",
    "when the average degree @xmath34 and the number of individuals per opinion @xmath35 , this transition occurs at @xmath36 .",
    "see @xcite@xcite for recent work on this model .    in @xcite",
    ", we studied a two - opinion version of this model in which on each step an edge is chosen at random and is given a random orientation , @xmath37 .",
    "if the individuals at the two ends have the same opinion nothing happens . if they differ , then ( i ) with probability @xmath14 we set @xmath15 ; ( ii ) otherwise ( i.e. , with probability @xmath3 ) @xmath0 breaks its edge to @xmath1 and reconnects to ( a ) a vertex chosen at random from those with opinion @xmath16 , a process we label ` rewire - to - same ' , or ( b ) at random from the graph , a process we label ` rewire - to - random ' . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the second rewiring option , rewire - to - random . while this process may be less intuitive than the rewire - to - same version , it has a more interesting phrase - transition , as documented in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we recall the main results from @xcite that provide essential context for our observations of the multiple - opinion case , which we begin to explore in section [ sec : multi ] .",
    "we then continue in section [ sec : quant ] with further quantitative details about the phase transitions and their underlying quasi - stationary distributions , before concluding comments in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "suppose , for concreteness , that the initial social network is an erds - rnyi random graph in which each individual has average degree @xmath38 , and that vertices are assigned opinions 1 and 0 independently with probabilities @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "simulations suggest that the system has the following    to help understand the last statement , the reader should consult the picture in figure [ fig : rewire_to_random_p1 ] .",
    "if the initial fraction of 1 s @xmath41 then as @xmath3 decreases from 1 , the ending density @xmath42 stays constant at 1/2 until @xmath43 and then decreases to a value close to 0 at @xmath25 . for convenience",
    ", we call the graph of @xmath42 for @xmath44 , the _",
    "universal curve_. if the initial density is @xmath45 , then the ending density @xmath46 stays constant at @xmath39 until the flat line @xmath47 hits the universal curve and then @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the main aim of @xcite was to use simulations , heuristic arguments , and approximate models to explain the presence and properties of this universal curve describing the consensus states that result from the slow - consensus process . to make it easier to compare the results here with the previous paper , we rescale time so that times between updating steps are exponential with rate @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the total number of edges .",
    "the final fractions of the minority below phase transitions follow an universal curve independent of the initial fractions.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to further explain the phrase `` quasi - stationary distributions '' in this context , we refer the reader to figure [ fig : n1n010v3 ] .",
    "let @xmath50 be the number of vertices in state 1 at time @xmath51 , @xmath52 be the number of @xmath12-@xmath53 edges ( that is , the number of edges connecting nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "similarly , let @xmath56 be the number of connected triples @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : n1n010v3 ] plots @xmath61 versus @xmath62 for five different simulations ( with different initial densities , @xmath39 ) for @xmath63 . note that in each case the simulation rapidly approaches a curve @xmath64 and then diffuses along the curve until consensus is reached ( @xmath65 ) . at both of the possible consensus points on the curve ,",

    "this is somewhat analogous to a stationary distribution from equilibrium statistical mechanics  e.g . , the maxwell - boltzmann distribution associating the velocity distribution with the temperature .",
    "we call our distributions quasi - stationary because our system is a finite state markov chain , which will eventually reach one of its many absorbing states @xmath65 , and hence there is no true stationary distribution .",
    "nevertheless , an improved understanding of the system is obtained from these observations , displaying a fast dynamics rapidly converging to a family of neutrally - stable quasi - stationary distributions followed by slow , diffusive dynamics through the space local to the quasi - stationary distributions until consensus is reached .    to begin to explain the behavior of @xmath72 given in ( [ wf ] ) , note that when an edge is picked with two endpoints that differ , a rewiring will not change the number of 1 s , while a voting event , which occurs with probability @xmath2 , will result in an increase or decrease of the number of 1 s with equal probability . when @xmath73 the rate at which @xmath12-@xmath53 edges are chosen is equal to the expected fraction of @xmath12-@xmath53 edges under @xmath74 , which is @xmath75 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the behaviors for the rewire - to - same model in terms of quasi - stationary distributions are very similar , but with small differences from the rewire - to - random model that yield fundamentally different consensus states . in rewire - to -",
    "same , there are quasi - stationary distributions @xmath76 under which the expected fraction of @xmath12-@xmath53 edges is @xmath77 .",
    "again the simulation comes rapidly to this curve and diffuses along it until consensus is reached .",
    "that is , unlike figure [ fig : n1n010v3 ] ( top ) , the arches of quasi - stationary @xmath78 values versus @xmath70 maintain their zeros at @xmath79 .",
    "thus , for @xmath80 , the minority fraction obtained at the consensus time is always @xmath81 for rewire - to - same .",
    "bhme and gross @xcite have studied the three - opinion version of the evolving voter model with rewire - to - same dynamics . in this case , the limiting behavior is complicated ",
    "one may have partial fragmentation ( 1 s split off rapidly from the 2 s and 3 s ) in addition to full fragmentation and coexistence of the three opinions .",
    "see their figures 35 . as we will see in the present section ,",
    "the behavior of the multi - opinion rewire - to - random model is much simpler because small groups of individuals with the same opinion will be drawn back into the giant component .",
    "we thus aim to extend the understanding of the two - opinion model behavior to larger numbers of opinions .",
    "consider now the @xmath82-opinion model in which voters are assigned independent initial opinions that are equal to @xmath83 with probability @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 and let @xmath86 be the number of edges at which the endpoint opinions differ .",
    "when @xmath87 , frequencies of the three types must lie in the triangle of possible values @xmath88 . to preserve symmetry , we draw @xmath89 as an equilateral triangle in barycentric coordinates by mapping @xmath90 .",
    "the top panel in figure [ fig : levelset2 ] plots @xmath91 as a function of the opinion densities as the system evolves , generalizing the one - dimensional arch observed for @xmath92 to a two - dimensional cap for @xmath87 .",
    "generalizing the parabolic form of the arch for @xmath92 , we conjecture e_u n_/m = ( 1- _ i=1^k u_i^2 ) - c_0 ( ) .",
    "[ quadcap ] as in the two opinion case , the simulated values come quickly to the surface and then diffuse along it . in some situations ,",
    "one opinion is lost before consensus occurs and the evolution reduces to that for the two opinion case .",
    "however , in one of the simulations shown , the realization ending with @xmath93 , all three opinions persist until the end .    .",
    "multiple simulations corresponding to different initial densities are shown while each one starts from an erds - rnyi graph with n=10,000 nodes and average degree @xmath69 .",

    "( [ quadcap ] ) as well as the consensus opinion frequencies from the simulations ( indicated by small circle data points ) .",
    "the two agree with each other up to small stochastic fluctuations .",
    "the size of the @xmath96 level set then dictates different consensus state properties .",
    "for example , the circle corresponding to @xmath63 intersects @xmath89 in three disconnected arcs . as @xmath3 increases , the radius of the @xmath96 level set decreases .",
    "when @xmath97 , the critical value of the two opinion model , the circle @xmath96 falls fully inside the triangle , so an initial condition including all three opinions will continue to demonstrate all three opinions at consensus .",
    "for example , the small circles around the innermost circle give the ending frequencies for several simulations for @xmath98 .",
    "if the initial frequencies fall within the @xmath96 circle , then the model will quickly relax to the quasi - stationary distributions above the circle and then diffuse along the cap until consensus is reached at some @xmath96 point . if instead the initial frequencies @xmath39 fall outside the @xmath96 circle  that is , for @xmath3 above the phase transition point @xmath99the consensus time jumps from @xmath29 to @xmath100 , similar to @xmath101 for the two - opinion model , with the final opinion frequencies essentially the same as the initial @xmath39 .",
    "what is new in this case is that when starting with three opinions and @xmath102 , the system always ends up with three distinct opinions .    for @xmath103 ,",
    "our simulation results indicate the same type of behavior as the system evolves .",
    "we define @xmath104 to be the largest @xmath3 for which consensus takes @xmath29 updates when we start with @xmath82 opinions with density @xmath105 for each opinion . then as @xmath106 the multi - opinion model has infinitely many phase transitions .",
    "when @xmath107 , consensus occurs after @xmath100 steps if we start with @xmath82 opinions , while if we start with @xmath108 equally likely opinions the system quickly converges to a quasi - stationary distribution and diffuses until consensus occurs after @xmath29 updates and there will always be @xmath108 opinions present at the end .",
    "the associated picture is the natural dimensional extension of the relationship between the @xmath92 and @xmath87 models : just as @xmath109 corresponds to the point at which the @xmath96 circle for @xmath87 is the inscribed circle within the @xmath89 triangle , @xmath110 corresponds to the point at which the @xmath96 circle reaches zero radius  that is , the point at which the @xmath96 sphere for @xmath111 has become the inscribed sphere within the corresponding barycentric tetrahedron .",
    "for each @xmath82 we simulate our multi - opinion rewire - to - random model starting from @xmath82 opinions with each opinion taking @xmath105 fraction of nodes at random for a wide range of @xmath3 s . generalizing the picture of the one - dimensional arch for @xmath92 and the two - dimensional cap for @xmath87 , the number of discordant edges as a function of frequencies conjectured in eq .",
    "( [ quadcap ] ) is a co - dimension 1 hypersurface characterizing the quasi - stationary states , and the behavior of the equal - initial - populations case will allow us to describe this surface , thereby characterizing behaviors for general initial populations .",

    "the graphs shows some curvature near @xmath117 , which may be caused by the fact that @xmath117 ( @xmath25 ) corresponds to a voter model without evolution of the underlying network . in the rest of the paper",
