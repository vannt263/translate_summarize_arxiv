    "with the precise formulation of the @xmath0 expansion in qcd using effective field theory and operator product expansion heavy quark physics has been based on model independent ground , which allows to reduce the uncertainties due to the qcd bound state problem drastically . from the point of view of weak interactions",
    "the main interest in processes with heavy quarks lies in the exploration and the test of the ckm sector of the standard model ( sm ) describing the masses and the mixing of quarks . from the experimental side",
    "the running experiments as well as the ones planned in the near future constitute a large effort to explore this part of the sm , which is not yet tested with an accuracy comparable with the one of the coupling of the @xmath2 to the fermions .",
    "the main theoretical progress in the description of systems involving a single heavy quark is based on the infinite mass limit of qcd @xcite , in which two additional symmetries appear that are not present in full qcd @xcite .",
    "this limit may be regarded as the leading term of a @xmath0 expansion and a systematic approximation to full qcd may be constructed using the methods of effective field theory , the so - called heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite . the heavy mass limit and applications of hqet",
    "have been extensively studied , and the development of the field is documented in more or less extensive reviews @xcite .",
    "the corrections to the heavy mass limit are characterized by two small parameters , namely the strong coupling constant , taken at the scale of the heavy quark @xmath3 and the ratio @xmath4 of the scale of the light degrees of freedom @xmath5 and the heavy quark mass .",
    "while the first kind of corrections may be calculated perturbatively in terms of feynman diagrams , the second type needs additional non - perturbative input encoded in the matrix elements of higher dimensional operators .    however , the non - perturbative input is to be taken at a small scale , where the symmetries of hqet may be applied and hence the non - perturbative physics is constrained by these symmetries .",
    "in particular , for heavy to heavy decays these additional symmetries restrict the number of independent form factors to only a single one , of which the absolute normalization at a specific kinematic point is fixed by the symmetries .    by combining the method of the @xmath0 expansion with the short distance expansion",
    "one may obtain a heavy mass expansion also for inclusive decay rates @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the heavy quark mass sets a scale that is large compared to @xmath6 , and one may use a similar setup as in deep inelastic scattering for the description of inclusive decays . in this way one may not only study total rates , but also differential distributions such as the lepton energy spectra in inclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "this series of three lectures tries to summarize the basic ideas of the heavy mass expansion . in the first lecture the formulation of hqet as an effective field theory",
    "is described and the additional symmetries of heavy quarks are introduced . the second and third lecture deal with applications to exclusive and inclusive decays .",
    "effective field theories @xcite have become a widely used tool in modern elementary particle physics .",
    "an effective theory treatment is convenient if the problem under consideration involves very disparate mass scales such that the physics that is to be described happens at much lower energies than the scale set by some heavy particles in the theory .",
    "in such a case it is useful to switch to an effective theory in which the heavy degrees of freedom do not appear explicitly ; they only reappear in the effective theory as higher dimensional operators , which are multiplied by coupling constants with negative mass dimension .",
    "the scale of the coupling constants is set by the large mass and thus these contributions are small , if the scale of the physics described with the help of the effective theory is small compared to this large mass .",
    "an effective theory is always valid only in a limited region of scales , a natural cut - off is given by the mass of the particle which has been removed by switching from the full to the effective theory .",
    "as mentioned above an effective theory involves interactions which would lead to a non - renormalizable theory , if one would consider the theory to all orders in these higher dimensional operators .",
    "however , working to a definite order of the expansion in inverse powers of the large scale one does not face any problem concerning renormalization . starting from the renormalizable dimension-4 piece of the effective theory lagrangian we may use its renormalization group properties to study the cut - off dependence of the effective theory , which is determined by the short distance properties of the effective theory .    applying effective theory methods",
    "corresponds to an expansion of the greens functions of the full theory in inverse powers of the large mass scale ; such an expansion is only possible up to logarithmic dependences on this large scale .",
    "these logarithms may be accessed using a properly constructed effective theory , where these logarithms correspond to the renormalization group logarithms of the cut off . in this way",
    "one may even achieve a resummation of the logarithmic terms using renormalization group methods in the effective theory .    in the case at hand",
    "the large scale is the mass @xmath1 of the heavy quark , and the leading term of this expansion is the static limit .",
    "this effective theory ( heavy quark effective theory , hqet ) is a a powerful tool , allowing for numerous purely qcd based calculations .",
    "renormalization in this effective theory implies a factorization theorem for the greens function of full qcd , which means that to any order in the @xmath0 expansion one may factorize the short distance physics from the long distance effects .",
    "explicitly this means for a greens function @xmath7 calculated in full qcd that one may rewrite it as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the renormalization point of the full qcd function . here",
    "the constants @xmath10 depend on the factorization scale @xmath11 and on logarithms of @xmath1 ; it contains all the short distance effects , which may be calculated perturbatively . using the renormalization group of the effective theory",
    ", one may perform a systematic resummation of logarithmic dependences on the heavy quark mass .",
    "the greens functions @xmath12 are calculated in hqet and do not depend on the heavy mass any more ; they contain the long distance effects which are not calcualable via perturbation theory .",
    "however , as we shall see below , they are constrained by heavy quark symmetries .",
    "consequently one gains complete control over the mass dependence by switching from full qcd to hqet , the effective theory obtained in the heavy mass limit .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the formulation of this effective theory .",
    "first we shall review and compare some of the different possibilities to formulate the infinite mass limit . in this limit",
    "new symmetries appear which are the key to various model independent statements concerning weak decay matrix elements ; these symmetries are reviewed in paragraph 3.1 .",
    "finally , we shall consider the systematic approach to the calculation of corrections to the infinite mass limit .      this issue has been discussed repeatedly and various formulations of the infinite mass limit are available .",
    "of course , as far as physical quantities are concerned , all approaches yield the same result .",
    "however , for some special applications one approach may be more convenient than another .",
    "the equivalence of all different approaches is ensured by a theorem well established in the field of effective theories .",
    "it has been shown that in an effective theory involving a field @xmath13 one may perform redefinitions of the fields , such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary polynomial function @xcite .",
    "such a redefinition will not change the @xmath16-matrix , although the lagrangian ( and greens function ) expressed in the redefined fields may look completely different . in this sense the different formulations of hqet are equivalent .    in the following",
    "we shall consider two formulations of hqet .",
    "the first one nicely exhibits the fact that hqet is an effective theory in the sense that one integrates out a heavy degree of freedom and performs an expansion of the remaining action functional in the large mass scale , which for the case at hand is the heavy quark mass .",
    "the process of integrating out the heavy degree of freedom may be performed explicitly as a gaussian functional integral , and one may construct a formulation of hqet be expanding the result in powers of @xmath0 . in this way one obtains a @xmath0 expansion of both the heavy quark field as well as for the lagrangian .",
    "the second formulation is based on the standard way of separating `` upper '' and `` lower '' components of the spinor fields by performing a sequence of foldy wouthuysen transformations . these transformations lead to an expansion in @xmath0 for the heavy quark field and for the lagrangian , which is different for each of these quantities from the other formulation .",
    "however , if one calculates a physical quantity , both approaches will yield the same answer , because the @xmath0 expansion has to be unique for an observable .",
    "one may obtain a formulation of the heavy mass limit by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom from the functional integral of qcd greens functions @xcite .",
    "this integration may in fact be done explicitly , since for the case at hand it amounts to a gaussian functional integration . formulating the heavy mass limit in this way clearly exhibits that it corresponds to an effective theory in the usual sense .",
    "we start from the generating functional of the qcd greens functions @xmath17[d \\bar{q } ]                                    [ d \\phi_\\lambda ] \\exp \\biggl\\ { i s + i s_\\lambda       + i \\int d^4 x \\ , ( \\bar{\\eta } q + \\bar{q } \\eta                          + \\phi_\\lambda \\lambda )       \\biggr\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the light degrees of freedom ( light quarks @xmath19 and gluons @xmath20 ) with the action @xmath21 , while @xmath16 denotes the piece of the action for the heavy quark @xmath22 including its coupling to the gluons @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the covariant derivative of qcd .",
    "we have introduced source terms @xmath25 for the heavy quark and @xmath26 for the light degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall consider hadrons containing a single heavy quark , and we assume that this heavy hadron moves with a velocity @xmath27 @xmath28 this velocity vector may be used to split the heavy quark field @xmath22 into an `` upper '' component @xmath13 and a `` lower '' one @xmath29 @xmath30 and to define a decomposition of the covariant derivative into a `` longitudinal '' and a `` transverse '' ( @xmath31 ) part @xmath32 using ( [ splitu]-[splitd ] ) the action ( [ act ] ) of the heavy quark field takes the form @xmath33.\\ ] ] the heavy quark in the meson is very close to being on shell , and thus the space time dependence of the heavy quark field is mainly that of a free particle moving with velocity @xmath27 .",
    "this suggests a reparametrization of the fields by removing the space time dependence of a solution of the free dirac equation .",
    "we shall choose the `` particle - type '' parametrization corresponding to the `` positive energy solution '' of the dirac equation @xmath34 such that the space time dependence of the remaining fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 is determined by the residual momentum @xmath37 , which is due to binding effects of the heavy quark inside the heavy hadron , and which is a `` small '' quantity of order @xmath6 .",
    "expressed in these fields the action of the heavy quark becomes @xmath38,\\ ] ]    the term containing the sources is also rewritten in terms of the fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are now source terms for the upper component field @xmath35 and the lower componenent part @xmath36 respectively .    in terms of the new variables",
    "the generating functional reads @xmath42[d \\bar{h}_v][d h_v][d \\bar{h}_v ]          [ d \\phi_\\lambda ] \\\\ & &    \\exp \\left\\ { i s +   s_\\lambda+      i \\int d^4 x \\ , ( \\bar{\\rho}_v h_v + \\bar{h}_v \\rho_v               + \\bar{r}_v h_v + \\bar{h}_v r_v               + \\phi_\\lambda \\lambda )            \\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the action @xmath16 for the heavy quark is given in eq.([acth ] ) .    from ( [ acth ] )",
    "it is obvious that the heavy degree of freedom is the lower component field @xmath36 , since it has a mass term @xmath43 , while the upper component field @xmath35 is a massless field describing the static heavy quark . in the heavy mass limit",
    "only the greens functions involving the field @xmath35 have to be calculated , and hence we integrate over @xmath36 in the functional integral ( [ genfh ] ) with the sources of the lower component field @xmath41 and @xmath44 set to zero .",
    "this can be done explicitly , since it is a gaussian integration @xmath45[d \\bar{h}_v ]            [ d \\lambda ] \\delta      \\exp \\left\\ { i s + s_\\lambda +       i \\int d^4 x \\ , ( \\bar{\\rho}_v^+ h_v^+ + \\bar{h}_v^+ \\rho_v^+                        + \\phi_\\lambda \\lambda )         \\right\\},\\ ] ] where now the action functional for the heavy quark becomes a non - local object @xmath46.\\ ] ] this gaussian integration corresponds to the replacement @xmath47 for the lower compponent field .",
    "furthermore , the gaussian integration yields a determinant @xmath48 . in the full theory one may also perform this gaussian integration , and the determinant obtained contains all the closed loops of heavy quarks .",
    "after renormalization of the full theory their contribution starts at order @xmath49 with an uehling potential like term . in the effective theory one",
    "may take the determinant @xmath48 to be a constant , if the terms of order @xmath50 and higher comming from the closed heavy quark loops are included by matching to the full theory .",
    "since we shall discuss only the leading term of the @xmath0 expansion in this section , we may drop the determinant in what follows .",
    "the non - locality of the action functional is connected to the large scale set by the heavy quark mass , and the non - local terms may be expanded in terms of an infinite series of local operators , which come with increasing powers of @xmath0 . in the context of a field theory",
    "this corresponds to a short distance expansion and hence these operators have to be renormalized .",
    "the tree level relations may be read off from the geometric series expansion of the non - local term in ( [ actnl ] ) . in this way",
    "we obtain the expansion of the field and the lagrangian @xmath51 h_v \\\\        & = & e^{-im_qvx } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{2m_q } \\fmslash{d}_\\perp +   \\nonumber        \\left(\\frac{1}{2m_q}\\right)^2 ( -ivd ) \\fmslash{d}_\\perp + \\cdots \\right ] h_v \\\\",

    "the net effect of this is that the heavy quark fields in the operator insertion are replaced by the expansion ( [ harvfield ] ) .",
    "a second way of formulating the heavy mass limit proceed along the well known steps performed in deriving the non - relativistic limit of the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the reasoning used here is motivated by quantum mechanics ; as a first step one rewrites the equation of motion in a hamiltonian form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the gluon field .",
    "note that in the rest frame we have @xmath54 , and thus ( [ schroe ] ) takes the usual form , since @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in general the hamiltonian couples the upper and the lower component of the heavy quark field @xmath22 , projected out by @xmath57 . the foldy wouthuysen transformation is a transformation of the form @xmath58 \\exp(-if)\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a hermitian matrix in the space of the dirac spinors , such that @xmath60 is unitary in that space .",
    "this requirement is motivated by quantum mechanics where the spinor is interpreted as a wave function , but this interpretation becomes meaningless once we switch to a field theory .",
    "the transformation ( [ fw ] ) is designed such that the resulting hamiltonian @xmath61 does not couple upper and lower components of the field @xmath22 any more .",
    "the generator @xmath59 of this transformation may be expanded in powers of @xmath0 , from which one may construct a @xmath0 expansion of the hamiltonian and the transformed fields .",
    "removing the mass term of the hamiltonian by a phase redefinition as in ( [ harvfield ] ) , one obtains for the fields and the lagrangian @xmath62 h_v ( x)\\ , , \\\\ \\label{fwlag } & & { \\cal l } = \\bar h_v\\left [ iv \\cdot d - \\frac{1}{2m_q } \\fmslash{d}_{\\perp}^2   + \\frac{i}{4m_q^2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2 } \\fmslash{d}_{\\perp}^2 v \\cdot d + \\fmslash{d}_{\\perp } v\\cdot d   \\fmslash{d}_{\\perp } - \\frac{1}{2 } v\\cdot d   \\fmslash{d}_{\\perp}^2 \\right ) + \\cdots \\right ] h_v\\,.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the leading order term as well as the terms of order @xmath0 are identical in the two approaches .",
    "differences start to appear at order @xmath50 , which are terms involving a factor which would vanish by leading order equations of motion . in the fouldy wouthuysen formulation",
    "the lagrangian does not contain such terms , while these terms appear in the approach of integrating out the lower components of the heavy quark field .",
    "however , subleading terms of a physical matrix element will consist of local contributions originating from the expansion of the field @xmath22 as well as of non - local pieces involving time - ordered products of the leading order currents with the subleading terms of the lagrangian ( see below ) .",
    "if the time - ordered products are taken with a term that would vanish by a naive application of the leading - order equation of motion , these will lead to a contact terms , i.e.  effectively to a local contribution . in this way the terms in the first approach rearrange in such a way that the final result for an observable quantity is the same in both cases .",
    "for some practical applications the foldy wouthuysen approach has an advantage that all the time - ordered product with the lagrangian are truly non - local contributions , in other words , none of the contributions will lead to a contact term .",
    "corrections to the infinite mass limit may be considered in a systematic way .",
    "starting from the tree level expressions given in the last sections one may use the expansion of the lagrangian and the fields as given in section 2.1 . to construct the @xmath0 expansion of full qcd matrix elements . in doing this",
    "it will not matter which representation of hqet ( e.g. the one that is obtained from integrating out the heavy quark or the one constructed from the foldy wouthuysen transformation ) , since the matrix elements have to have a unique @xmath0 expansion .",
    "as an example we shall consider a matrix element of a current @xmath63 mediating a transition between a heavy meson and some arbitrary state @xmath64 .",
    "the full qcd lagrangian @xmath65 and the fields @xmath22 are expanded in terms of a power series in @xmath0 in the way described in section 2.1 , and the matrix element under consideration up to order @xmath0 takes the form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the first - order corrections to the lagrangian as given in ( [ harvlag ] ) or ( [ fwlag ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath68 is the state of the heavy meson in full qcd , including all its mass dependence , while @xmath69 is the corresponding state in the infinite mass limit .    expression ( [ exp ] ) displays the generic structure of the higher - order corrections as they appear in any hqet calculation .",
    "there will be local contributions coming from the expansion of the full qcd field ; these may be interpreted as the corrections to the currents .",
    "the non - local contributions , i.e.  the time - ordered products , are the corresponding corrections to the states and thus in the r.h.s .  of ( [ exp ] ) only the states of the infinite - mass limit appear .",
    "if one switches to another representation of hqet , one reshuffles terms from the fields into the lagrangian ; in this way the lagrangian picks up operators which are proportional to the equations of motion .    as an example for the kinds of matrix elements appearing in subleading orders of the @xmath0 expansion we consider the mass of a heavy hadron . in the infinite mass limit",
    "this mass is given in terms of the quark mass plus some `` binding energy '' @xmath70 .",
    "the corrections are of order @xmath0 and are given by the matrix elements of the leading correction term of the lagrangian .",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 for the @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the @xmath75 meson . up to this order",
    "no non - local terms appear ; such terms show up the first time at order @xmath76 .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 correspond to matrix elements involving higher order terms that appear in the effective theory lagrangian @xmath79 where the normalization of the states is chosen to be @xmath80 .",
    "these parameters may be interpreted as the binding energy of the heavy meson in the infinite mass limit ( @xmath5 ) , the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the heavy quark ( @xmath77 ) and its energy due to the chromomagnetic moment of the heavy quark ( @xmath78 ) inside the heavy meson .",
    "the latter two parameters play an important role since they parametrize the non - perturbative input needed in the subleading order of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the only parameter which is easy to access is @xmath78 , since it is related to the mass splitting between @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from the @xmath83-meson system",
    "we obtain @xmath84 from the charm system the same value is obtained .",
    "this shows that indeed the spin - symmetry partners are degenerate in the infinite mass limit and the splitting between them scales as @xmath0 .",
    "the other parameters appearing in ( [ massrel ] ) are not simply related to the hadron spectrum . using the pole mass for @xmath1 in ( [ massrel ] ) , qcd sum rules yield for a value of @xmath85 mev @xcite .",
    "more problematic is the parameter @xmath77 ; from its definition one is led to assume @xmath86 ; a more restrictive inequality @xmath87 has been derived in a quantum mechanical framework in @xcite and using heavy - flavour sum rules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exists also a sum rule estimate @xcite for this parameter : @xmath88 this value is compatible with the bounds ; however , it is unexpectedly large since it corresponds to a rms - momentum of the heavy quark inside the meson of @xmath89 which is large compared to the naive guess of @xmath90 this is the reason why also smaller values of @xmath77 have been used in the literature .",
    "recently there has been an attempt @xcite to extract @xmath5 and @xmath77 from the shape of the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic @xmath83 decays ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) .",
    "the values obtained from this analysis are @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev@xmath93 , where the @xmath94 definition of the mass has been used .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are only the @xmath95 statistical ones ; the systematical uncertainties of this approach are difficult to estimate .",
    "going beyond tree level will induce corrections of order @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "these may be calculated in terms of feynman diagrams which may be evaluated using the feynman rules of hqet .",
    "only two feynmal rules are modified compared to full qcd :    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     for the sake of clarity we shall stick to our example of a heavy light current considered above . to leading order in the @xmath0 expansion one may evaluate the radiative corrections to such a matrix element using the above feynman rules and finds a divergent result with a divergence related to the short distance behaviour . since hqet is an effective theory , the machinery of effective theory guarantees the factorization of long distance effects from the short distance ones , which are related to the large mass @xmath1 .",
    "neglecting @xmath0 corrections , this factorization takes the form @xmath98 from feynman rule calculation one obtains the perturbative expansion of the renormalization constant @xmath99 which generically looks like @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "this factorization theorem corresponds to the statement that the ultraviolet divergencies in the effective theory have to match the logarithmic mass dependences of full qcd .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath11 is an arbitrary parameter , and the physical quantity @xmath102 does not depend on this parameter .",
    "however , calculating the matrix element of this operator in the effective theory and studying its ultraviolet behaviour allows us to access the mass dependence of the matrix element @xmath102 .",
    "the ultraviolet behaviour of the effective theory is investigated by the renormalization group equations .",
    "differentiating ( [ expr ] ) with respect to the factorization scale @xmath11 yields the renormalization group equation @xmath103 from which we may obtain an equation which determines the change of the coefficient @xmath99 when the scale is changed @xmath104 the quantity @xmath105 is called the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath106 which is universal for all matrix elements of this operator , since it is connected with the short distance behaviour of the insertion of @xmath107 .",
    "eq.([rge ] ) describes the renormalization group scaling in the effective theory .",
    "it allows to shift logarithms of the large mass scale from the matrix element of @xmath107 into the coefficient @xmath99 : if the matrix element is renormalized at the large scale @xmath1 the logarithms of the type @xmath108 will apear in the matrix element of @xmath107 while the coefficient @xmath99 at this scale will simply be @xmath109 the renormalization group equation ( [ rge ] ) allows to lower the renormalization point from @xmath1 to @xmath11 ; the matrix element renormalized at @xmath11 will not contain any logarithms of @xmath1 any more , they will appear in the coefficient @xmath99 in the way shown in ( [ zexp ] ) .    in all cases relevant in the present context",
    "the matrix elements will be matrix elements involving hadronic states , which are in most cases impossible to calculate from first principles .",
    "however , eq.([rge ] ) allows to extract the short distance piece , i.e.  the logarithms of the large mass @xmath1 and to separate it into the wilson coefficients .",
    "the anomalous dimension may be calculated in perturbation theory in powers of the coupling constant @xmath110 of the theory . in general , in a renormalizable theory the coupling constant depends on the scale @xmath11 at which the theory is renormalized .",
    "the scale dependence of the coupling constant is determined by the @xmath111 function @xmath112 in a mass independent scheme the renormalization group functions @xmath113 and @xmath111 will depend on the scale @xmath11 only through their dependence on the coupling constant @xmath114 hence we may rewrite the renormalization group equation ( [ rge ] ) as @xmath115 the renormalization group functions @xmath111 and @xmath113 are calculated in perturbation theory ; the first term of the @xmath111 function on qcd is obtained from a one - loop calculation and is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the number of active flavors , i.e.  the number of flavors with a mass less than @xmath1 .    with this input",
    "the renormalization group equation may be solved to yield @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the first coefficient in the perturbative expansion of the anomalous dimension @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the one loop expression for the running coupling constant of qcd @xmath122 which is obtained from solving ( [ gml ] ) using ( [ beta0 ] ) .",
    "this expression corresponds to a summation of the leading logarithms @xmath123 which is achieved by a one - loop calculation of the renormalization group functions @xmath111 and @xmath124 ; in other words , in this way a resummation of the first column of the expansion ( [ zexp ] ) is obtained .    in a similar way one may also resum the second column of ( [ zexp ] ) , if the renormalization group functions @xmath111 and @xmath125 are calculated to two loops and the finite terms of the one loop expression are included .",
    "finally , the case we have considered as an example is indeed very simple ; in general all operators of a given dimension may mix under renormalization , i.e. instead of a simple anomalous dimension a matrix of anomalous dimensions may occur . for more details on this",
    "i refer the reader to a textbook discussion of these issues as given e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the main impact of the heavy quark limit is due to two additional symmetries which are not present in full qcd ; the first is a heavy flavour symmetry and the second one is the so - called spin symmetry .",
    "the presence of these symmetries implies wigner - eckart theorems for transition matrix elements which have far - reaching phenomenological consequences .",

    "the dimensions of the operators are compensated by inverse powers of a large scale , which is in general of the order of the heavy mass scale .",
    "the decay probability is then given as forward matrix elements of these operators between the state of the decaying heavy hadron ; these matrix elements still have a mass dependence , which then may be extracted in terms of a @xmath0 expansion using hqet as for exclusive decays .",
    "the method described below also allows us to deal with inclusive non - leptonic processes and hence in principle opens the possibility for a calculation of lifetimes and branching fractions in the framework of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this is remarkable , since non - leptonic processes are usually very hard to deal with , in particular the @xmath0 expansion has not ( yet ? ) brought any success in the field of exclusive non - leptonic decays .    applying the ope to the energy spectra of the charged lepton in inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons ,",
    "the relevant expansion parameter is not @xmath0 , but rather @xmath344 ; the denominator is thus the energy release of the decay . in almost all phase space",
    "the energy release is of the order of the heavy mass ; it is only in the endpoint region that it becomes small and hence the expansion breaks down .",
    "this problem may be fixed by a resummation of terms in the operator product expansion , which strongly resembles the summation corresponding to leading twist in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "analogously to the parton - distribution function , a universal function appears , which determines all inclusive heavy - to - light decays .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for a decay of a heavy ( down - type ) quark is in general linear in the decaying heavy flavoured quark @xmath345 where the operator @xmath190 describes the decay products . in the following",
    "we shall consider semileptonic decays , for which @xmath346 where @xmath19 is an up - type quark ( @xmath127 or @xmath172 , since we shall consider @xmath126 decays ) .",

    "finally , for radiative rare decays we have @xmath354 where @xmath355 is again a coefficient obtained from running between @xmath352 and @xmath242 .",
    "its value is @xmath356 , the corresponding analytical expression may be found in @xcite .",
    "the inclusive decay rate for a heavy hadron @xmath151 containing the quark @xmath22 may be related to a forward matrix element by @xmath357 where @xmath358 is the final state , which is summed over to obtain the inclusive rate .",
    "the matrix element appearing in ( [ inclusive ] ) contains a large scale , namely the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the first step towards a @xmath0 expansion is to make this large scale explicit .",
    "this may be done by a phase redefinition .",
    "this leads to @xmath359 where @xmath360 this relation exhibits the similarity between the cross - section calculation in deep inelastic scattering and the present approach to total rates . in deep inelastic scattering",
    "there appears a large scale , which is the momentum transfer to the leptons , while here the mass of the heavy quark appears as a large scale .",
    "the next step is to perform an operator product expansion of the product of the two hamiltonians . after the phase redefinition",
    "the remaining matrix element does not involve large momenta of the order of the heavy quark mass any more and hence a short - distance expansion becomes useful , if the mass @xmath1 is large compared to the scale @xmath5 determining the matrix element . the next step is thus to perform an operator - product expansion , which has the general form @xmath361 where @xmath362 are operators of dimension @xmath363 , with their matrix elements renormalized at scale @xmath11 , and @xmath364 are the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "these coefficients encode the short distance physics related to the heavy quark mass scale and may be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "all long distance contributions connected to the hadronic scale @xmath5 are contained in the matrix elements of the operators @xmath365 .",
    "still the matrix elements of @xmath365 are not independent of the heavy quark mass scale , but this mass dependence may be expanded in powers of @xmath0 by means of heavy quark effective theory .",
    "this is achived by expanding the heavy quark fields appearing in the operators @xmath362 using ( [ harvfield ] ) ( or , equivalently , ( [ fwfield ] ) ) as well as the states by including the corrections to the lagrangian given in ( [ harvlag ] ) ( or ( [ fwlag ] ) ) as time - ordered products . in this way",
    "the mass dependence of the total decay rate may be accessed completely within an expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "the lowest - order term of the operator product expansion are the dimension-3 operators . due to lorentz invariance and parity",
    "there are only two combinations which may appear , namely @xmath366 or @xmath367 .",
    "note that the @xmath368 operators differ from the full qcd operators only by a phase redefinition , and hence @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "the first combination is proportional to the @xmath22-number current @xmath371 , which is normalized even in full qcd , while the second differs from the first one only by terms of order @xmath50 @xmath372 h_v    + { \\cal o } ( 1/m_q^3 ) .\\ ] ] where @xmath373 is the gluon field strength .",
    "thus the matrix elements of the dimension-3 contribution is known to be normalized ; in the standard normalization of the states this implies @xmath374 where @xmath264 is the mass of the heavy hadron .",
    "to lowest order in the heavy mass expansion we may furthermore replace @xmath375 and hence we may evaluate the leading term in the @xmath376 expansion without any hadronic uncertainty .",
    "generically the dimension-3 contribution yields the free quark decay rate .",
    "this has been previously used as a model for inclusive decays , but now it turns out to be the first term in a systematic @xmath0 expansion of total rates .",
    "a dimension - four operators contains an additional covariant derivative , and thus one has matrix elements of the type @xmath377 since the equations of motion apply for this tree level matrix element , one finds that the constant @xmath378 has to vanish , and thus there are no dimension - four contributions .",
    "this statement is completely equaivalent to lukes theorem @xcite , since we are considering a forward matrix element , i.e. a matrix element at zero recoil @xcite .",
    "the first non - trivial non - perturbative contribution comes from dimension-5 operators and are of order @xmath50 .",
    "for mesonic decays there are only the two parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 given in ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam2 ] ) , which correspond to matrix elements of the subleading terms of the lagrangian .",
    "they parametrize the non - perturbative input in the order @xmath50 . for @xmath317-type baryons",
    "the parameter @xmath78 vanishes due to heavy quark spin symmetry , while the kinetic energy parameter @xmath77 is non - zero as well .",
    "in the framework of the @xmath0 expansion this leads to a difference in lifetimes between mesons and baryons .      in this subsection we shall collect the results for the total rates including the first non - trivial non - perturbative correction .",

    "the non - perturbative corrections turn out to be small , in the region of a few percent compared to the leading term , and the perturbative corrections turn out to be much larger than this .    finally , for the rare decay @xmath396",
    "one may as well calculate the non - perturbative contribution in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "one obtains @xmath397,\\ ] ] and the relative size of the non - perturbative corrections is the same as in the @xmath390 decays .",
    "typically the non - pertubative corrections are much smaller than the radiative corrections .",
    "the only exception is the endpoint region of lepton energy spectra which receives both large perturbative as well as non - perturbative corrections .",
    "however , this is only a small region in phase space and the corections to the total rates remain moderate .",
    "the subject of heavy hadron lifetimes is strongly related to non - leptonic processes , which have been considered already some time ago @xcite-@xcite ; however the application of the @xmath0 expansion has turned many assumptions into quantitative arguments .",
    "as outlined in the last section the @xmath0 expansion allows to calculate total rates , even for non - leptonic processes , and hence a qcd - based calculation of lifetimes becomes possible .",
    "a recent review of this subject is given in @xcite .",
    "studying the formulae obtained in the @xmath0 expansion up to order @xmath50 one finds that lifetime differences between @xmath83 mesons do not occur up to this level of the expansion ; in other words , any difference between the @xmath398 and the @xmath399 or the @xmath400 lifetimes are induced by effects of the order @xmath401 .",
    "these effects are due to dimension six operators of the four - quark form @xmath402     fig 1 -    in fig.[fig4 ] the relevant diagramms are shown .",
    "the two lower ones yield dimension six operators of the from ( [ 4quark ] ) ; comparing to the terminology used in phenomenological models the middle diagram is called weak annihilation ( wa ) and the lower one pauli interference ( pi ) .    the four quark operators appearing at order @xmath76 are usually estimated applying the vacuum insertion assumption , althought this procedure has been criticized recently @xcite",
    ". it amounts to replace @xmath403 and hence the parameter entering the estimates of the lifetime differences is the decay constant @xmath272 .",
    "the wa piece has been considered in @xcite and has been found to be small , of the order of one percent .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the pi diagram . for the lifetime of the @xmath404 one",
    "obtains @xcite @xmath405 where the pi contribution is @xmath406\\ ] ] where @xmath407 have been given in ( [ cpm ] ) .",
    "qcd radiative corrections change the sign of the pi contribution ; the constructive interference at the scale @xmath352 is turned into a destructive one at the scale @xmath242 prolonging the lifetime of the @xmath404 relative to the @xmath408 .",
    "using hqet the running of the coefficients below @xmath242 has also been calculated ; it has been found that the destructive interference is amplified by the running below @xmath242 , since @xmath409 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath410^{1/b } , \\mbox { with } b=11-\\frac{2}{3}n_f\\ ] ] and @xmath411 is some small hadronic scale , which may be defined e.g.  by @xmath412 .",
    "putting in numbers the result is @xcite @xmath413 hence the @xmath0 expansion ( in combination with vacuum insertion ) predicts a slightly longer lifetime for the charged @xmath83 meson compared to the neutral one .",
    "however , this is based on the vacuum insertion assumption which has been reconsidered recently in @xcite ; it is claimed that possible non - factorizable contributions may be enhanced by large prefactors thereby invalidating ( [ lrat ] ) .",
    "however , the estimate ( [ lrat ] ) is compatible with data ; the latest compilation yields @xcite @xmath414    applying the @xmath0 expansion for the lifetimes also to the @xmath169 system one finds large corrections . from the experimental side it is knwon that the lifetime differences are very large and that the naive parton model expectation fails by a large margin .",
    "this may be taken as an indication that the @xmath127 quark mass is indeed not large enough to justify a @xmath0 expansion , at least for the non - leptonic processes .",
    "the lifetimes of the two neutral @xmath83 mesons are equal up to terms of order @xmath401 , hence one expects @xmath415 to a good accuracy . here",
    "@xmath416 denotes the average lifetime of the two mass eigenstates of the @xmath417 system .",
    "while the lifetimes in the @xmath418 system are practically the same such that the difference may be neglected , it has been pointed out that this is not necessarily the case in the @xmath400 system ; the lifetime difference has been estimated in @xcite to be @xmath419 hence this difference may be as large twenty percent and thus it can not be neglected any more e.g. in an analysis of @xmath400-@xmath420 mixing .    finally we shall consider the @xmath126 baryon lifetimes .",
    "here we expect the differences between the meson and the baryon lifetimes to be of order @xmath49 , since the matrix elements of the kinetic energy operator as well as of the chromomagnetic moment operator are different between baryons and mesons ; in particular , due to spin symmetry the matrix element of the chromomagnetic moment operator vanishes for @xmath179-type baryons , since the light degrees of freedom are in a spin-0 state . probably only the @xmath179-type baryons will be stable against electromagnetic and strong decays , and hence their lifetime will be determined by the weak decay of the heavy quark .",
    "theoretical estimates of the @xmath421 lifetime have been attempted in @xcite and yield the expectation that @xmath422 this has to be confronted with the recent data @xcite @xmath423 thus the lifetime is slightly below the expectation , although this is not yet a significant deviation from the prediction . in particular , older data indicated that this lifetime ratio could have been as low as 0.7 ; such a low value would clearly indicate a theoretical problem in the @xmath0 expansion of the lifetimes , but the new data are in better agreement with the theoretical expectations .",
    "the method of the operator - product expansion may also be used to obtain the non - perturbative corrections to the charged lepton energy spectrum @xcite . in this case",
    "the operator product expansion is applied not to the full effective hamiltonian , but rather only to the hadronic currents .",
    "the rate is written as a product of the hadronic and leptonic tensor @xmath424 where @xmath425 is the phase - space differential .",
    "the short - distance expansion is then performed for the two currents appearing in the hadronic tensor . redefining the phase of the heavy - quark fields as in ( [ phaseredef ] ) one finds that the momentum transfer variable relevant for the short - distance expansion is @xmath426 , where @xmath19 is the momentum transfer to the leptons .",
    "the structure of the expansion for the spectrum is identical to the one of the total rate .",
    "the contribution of the dimension-3 operators yields the free - quark decay spectrum , there are no contributions from dimension-4 operators , and the @xmath251 corrections are parametrized in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . calculating the spectrum for @xmath380 yields @xcite-@xcite @xmath427 ^ 2 } ( 3 r^2 - 4 r^3 )     - \\frac{\\lambda_1}{m_b^2(1-y ) } ( r^2 - 2 r^3 )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{3\\lambda_2}{m_b^2(1-y ) } ( 2 r+3 r^2 - 5 r^3 )      + \\frac{\\lambda_1}{3 m_b^2 } [ 5y - 2(3-\\rho ) r^2 + 4 r^3 ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left",

    ", one has to perform some resummation of the operator product expansion .      very close to the endpoint of the inclusive semileptonic decay spectra only a few resonances contribute .",
    "in this resonance region one may not expect to have a good description of the spectrum using an approach based on parton - hadron duality ; here a sum over a few resonances will be appropriate",
    ".    in the variable @xmath438 the size of this resonance region is however of the order of @xmath439 and thus small . in a larger region of the order @xmath440 , which we shall call the endpoint region , many resonances contribute and",
    "one may hope to describe the spectrum in this region using parton - hadron duality .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that the @xmath434-function - like singularities appearing in ( [ buspec ] ) may be reinterpreted as the expansion of a non - perturbative function describing the spectrum in the endpoint region . keeping only the singular terms of ( [ buspec ] ) we write @xmath441 where @xmath442 is a non - perturbative function given in terms of the moments @xmath443 of the spectrum , taken over the endpoint region .",
    "these moments themselves have an expansion in @xmath0 such that @xmath444 , and we shall consider only the leading term in the expansion of the moments , corresponding to the most singular contribution to the endpoint region .    comparing ( [ buspec ] ) with ( [ shape ] ) and ( [ momexp ] ) one obtains that @xmath445 where the integral extends over the endpoint region .",
    "the non - perturbative function implements a resummation of the most singular terms contributing to the endpoint and , in the language of deep inelastic scattering , corresponds to the leading twist contribution .",
    "this resummation has been studied in qcd @xcite and the function @xmath446 may be related to the distribution of the light cone component of the heavy quark residual momentum inside the heavy meson .",
    "the latter is a fundamental function for inclusive heavy - to - light transitions , which has been defined in @xcite @xmath447 where @xmath448 is the positive light cone component of the residual momentum @xmath227 .",
    "the relation between the two functions @xmath16 and @xmath152 is given by @xmath449 from which we infer that the @xmath450 moment of the endpoint region is given in terms of the matrix element @xmath451 .",
    "the function @xmath152 is a universal distribution function , which appears in all heavy - to - light inclusive decays ; another example is the decay @xmath396 @xcite , where this function determines the photon - energy spectrum in a region of order @xmath0 around the @xmath452 peak .    in principle",
    "@xmath152 has to be determined by other methods than the @xmath0 expansion , e.g.  from lattice calculations or from a model , or it has to be determined from experiment by measuring the photon spectrum in @xmath396 or the lepton spectrum in @xmath453 . in the context of the model accmm model @xcite @xmath152 has been calculated in @xcite .    some of the properties of @xmath152 are known .",

    "[ fig3 ] we show the spectrum for @xmath384 using the ansatz ( [ ftoy ] ) .",
    "- fig 3     including the non - perturbative effects yields a reasonably behaved spectrum in the endpoint region and the @xmath434-function - like singularities have disappeared .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum now extends beyond the parton model endpoint ; it is shifted from @xmath459 to the physical endpoint @xmath460 , since @xmath152 is non - vanishing for positive values of @xmath461 .",
    "the development of the field of heavy quark physics has been indeed remarkable over the last few years , experimentally as well as theoretically . from the experimental side ,",
    "the progress in the technology of detectors ( e.g.  silicon vertex detectors ) opened the possibility to study @xmath126 physics even at machines which originally were not designed for this kind of research . in this way",
    "also the high energy colliders ( in particular lep and tevatron ) could contribute substantially in this area , since they allow to measure states ( such as the @xmath400 and the @xmath126 flavoured baryons ) which lie above the threshold of the @xmath462-@xmath83-factories .    from the theoretical side the heavy quark limit and hqet brought an important success , since it provides a model independent and qcd based framework for the description of processes involving heavy quarks .",
    "the effective theory approach has originally been formulated for exclusive decays but in the past few years a heavy mass expansion has been set up also for inclusive transitions .    as far as exclusive heavy to heavy decays are concerned , the additional symmetries of the heavy mass limit restrict the number of non - perturbative functions in a model independent way ; furthermore , heavy quark symmetries fix the absolute normalization of some of the transition amplitudes at the point of maximum momentum transfer .",
    "phenomenologically this has improved our knowledge on the ckm matrix element @xmath237 dramatically ; with the value @xmath463 the relative precision of this ckm matrix element is now about 5% and thus at a level of the precision with which the cabbibo angle is known .    in heavy",
    "to light decays heavy quark symmetries do not work as efficiently ; in this case only the relative normalization of @xmath83 decays versus the corresponding @xmath169 decays may be obtained . from the experimental side",
    "there are first measurements of @xmath312 and @xmath313 from the cleo collaboration and an extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath314 from these processes is still to some extent model dependent .",
    "the latest value for this ckm matrix element is @xmath464 where the last error is due to the model dependence .",
    "hqet does not yet have much to say about exclusive non - leptonic decays ; even for the decays @xmath465 , which involves three heavy quarks , heavy quark symmetries are not sufficient to yield useful relations between the decay rates @xcite .",
    "of course , with additional assumptions such as factorization one can go ahead and relate the non - leptonic decays to the semileptonic ones ; however , this is a very strong assumption and it is not clear in what sense factorization is an approximation . on the other side ,",
    "the data on the non - leptonic @xmath83 decays support factorization , and first attempts to understand this from qcd and hqet have been untertaken @xcite ; however , the problem of the exclusive non - leptonic decays still needs clarification and hopefully the heavy mass expansion will also be useful here .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion obtained from the ope and hqet offers the unique possibility to calculate the transition rates for inclusive decays in a qcd based and model independent framework .",
    "the leading term of this expansion is always the free quark decay , and the first non - trivial corrections are in general given by the mean kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside the heavy hadron @xmath77 and the matrix element @xmath78 of the chromomagnetic moment operator .",
    "the method also allows us to calculate differential distributions , such as the charged lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons . for this case , the expansion parameter is the inverse of the energy release @xmath466 , where @xmath467 is the lepton energy .",
    "close to the endpoint , the energy release is small and thus the expansion in its inverse powers becomes useless . in this kinematic region one may partially resume the @xmath0 expansion , obtaining a result closely analogous to the leading twist term in deep inelastic scattering . particularly in the endpoint region a non - perturbative function is needed which corresponds to the parton distributions parametrizing the deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the leading term of the @xmath0 expansion is the free quark decay , and the result for the semileptonic branching fraction in this approximation has been well known for some time .",
    "the first non - perturbative corrections turn out to be quite small and hence the main corrections are the perturbative qcd corrections , where in a recent calculation also the effects of finite charm quark mass have been taken into account @xcite .",
    "the radiative corrections lower the semileptonic branching fraction somewhat compared to the parton model .",
    "there has been some discussion on the issue of the semileptonic branching fraction triggered by the fact that the data used to be as low as @xmath468 with a relative error of about ten percent .",
    "such a low value for the semileptonic branching fraction in combination with tha charm counting in @xmath83 decays would indicate some theoretical problem ; however , the recent lep data yield a value of @xmath469 which is compatible with the theoretical expectations .",
    "the expansion in powers of the inverse quark mass has become the standard tool in heavy quark physics and with the forthcomming experiments one may expect a strong improvement in our knowledge of the ckm sector of the sm , in particular a test of cp violation as it is encoded in the ckm matrix of the sm .",
