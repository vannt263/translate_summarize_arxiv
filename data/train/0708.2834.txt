    "another parameter we did take into account is related to the doping on the surface . to consider doped surfaces , a simple approximation can be performed without the inclusion of atoms in the system , such as p or s. this can be achieved by modifying the fermi level of the substrate .",
    "we have considered three cases where the chemical potential of the surface is assumed to be @xmath42 - 4.8 ev ( initial case ) , -4.3 ev ( n - type ) and -5.3 ev ( p - type ) . for each case , there are different equilibrium conditions controlled by the chemical potential .",

    "one of the important aspect of the doping effect , is that molecular states have been also shifted according to each doped case and , in particular , the n - type surface ( @xmath45 ) have moved ( red shifted ) the molecular states to the region of the calculated energy gap for the si[111 ] surface ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",

[ fig7 ] where the tip shape is obtained with 30 au atoms .",
    "the molecule - tip distance has been fixed to 5.0 angs .",
    "for the flat electrode , we have considered a distance of 5.2 angs .",
    "these distances are long enough to consider only tunneling current between the molecule and the tip / electrode .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the i - v characteristics with and without a tip . in the case of the tip ,",
    "the intensity of the current was multiplied by 5 for better comparison .",
    "we can see that at low voltages ( positive and negative ) , the behavior is rather similar between them , but this description changes when the bias is higher in the positive direction . the ndr effect observed in the case of the flat electrode , has been diminished until dissappear , showing in contrast an almost constant behavior when a bias between 0.5 and 1.5 v is applied .",

    "[ fig8 ] show the comparison between the flat electrode and the tip , in particular , a change in the magnitude of the peak located at 0.2 ev above the fermi level , where the intensity is diminished when the tip is considered .",
    "there is also another difference mainly localized at lower energies and can be attributed to the considered tip .",
    "+      the previous discussed molecular geometry is the one which has attracted more attention when it is supported by si[100 ] surface  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have found a second , stable configuration ( b case ) when the styrene molecule is interacting with the si[111 ] with no reconstruction .",
    "is important to notice that the energetic optimization shows that e(case b ) @xmath46 e(case a ) , which means that this configuration is much more stable . in this case",

    ", we can see molecular levels energetically located not only close , but also in the energy gap associated to the surface ( graph b in fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the two molecular states localized around 0 and 0.7 correspond to the original lumo and lumo+1 states respectively and they play an important role in the conduction phenomena . after we have evaluated the electronic configuration at equilibrium conditions ( without bias ) , the i - v curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] with the same voltage range as case a. interestingly , the i - v characteristic does not seem to show a similar ndr effect when a positive bias is applied , like in the first case . instead of this effect",
    ", there is no an important contribution for the current at low positive voltages until a bias of 2.0 v is applied . instead , when the negative bias is considered , there is current flow even at low voltages .        if we want to know about the states that participate in the electronic transport , it is possible to evaluate the differential conductance di / dv and the conductance @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . in this case",
    ", the contribution of the state located initially at 0.7 ev above the fermi level , has a very small intensity in di / dv characteristic compared to other states .",
    "even the conductance and the di / dv of the state located at 0.2 ev below the fermi level , is also small in comparison to , for example , the states located at 2.3 ev above the fermi level .",
    "there is also a spread distribution of the conductance and di / dv characteristics for low negative values ( between -1.0 and 0.2 ev below @xmath47 ) . in this case",
    ", there will be important to notice that this distribution is located in the same energy interval associated to the dangling bonds on the silicon surface .",
    "following the same lines than in the previous configuration , we did also study the transport properties as function of surface doping .",
    "as previously explained , we did obtain these conditions by modifying the chemical potential .",
    "results for the i - v characteristics are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "this figure shows clearly different results when the substrate is n - type or p - type doped . in the first case , we have the results obtained for   ( b case ) on si[111 ] with a chemical potential of -4.8 ev ( original conditions ) .",
    "the current increases steadily after an applied bias of 2.0 v. when the surface is n - type doped ( considering @xmath48 ) , there is no response in the current until 0.6 v , where the intensity starts to increase rapidly with the positive applied bias .",
    "a completely different behavior is obtained when the surface is p - type ( which means that @xmath49 ) . here",
    "we can see that a ndr effect is obtained for the current around 1 - 2 v , when even if the positive bias is increasing , the current flow is decreasing in magnitude until a minimum value around 2 v. after this bias , the current increases its value again in a similar way like in the two other doped surfaces .",
    "is adjusted to each case . ]",
    "the figure  [ fig13 ] shows the dos and the di / dv characteristic associated with doped o undoped surface .",
    "here , we notice that the energy has been adjusted to each different fermi level , so the zero energy position is indeed different for each condition .",
    "it is important to notice that even with a similar distribution of the molecular states , the differential conductance looks rather different . for the undoped surface",
    ", there is no an important peak for di / dv at low voltages and the main one is located at 2.4 v , with a spread contribution of states obtained around 0 v. if we consider the n - type si[111 ] surface , we can detect an important peak located around 0 v within with the same spread distribution as for the undoped case . for the p - type surface",
    ", we can see a small peak around 0.0 v and 2 important peaks , one located around 0.7 v and the other one at 2.5 v.     is adjusted considering three cases . in the case of di / dv , values were shifted in intensity for a better description ]    for all doped - undoped surfaces , the same peak , locate around 2.5 , is clearly depicted and is related to the state found at 2.4 ev above the fermi level .",
    "again , the states related to the peaks close to the fermi level , provide the most important contribution when a low voltage regime is considered .",
    "here , we have reported a set of electronic transport calculations for a semiconductor - cluster - electrode system .",
    "initially we have obtained two possible configurations ( a and b cases ) for the styrene molecule given by the minimization of the energy associated to the surface - molecule system .",
    "the most stable configuration corresponds to the b case and the a case corresponds to the atomic configuration of the molecule used for si[111 ] surface , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for the a case",
    ", we have obtained a ndr effect when a positive bias is applied .",
    "this can be understood based on the shifting of the molecular levels , close to the fermi level , when the voltage is applied .",
    "this effect is modulated when the surface has been doped , which changes the chemical potential .",
    "this effect is more important for the case of a p - type surface , as it is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , when compared to the n - type surface , where the effect is eliminated from the i - v characteristic .",
    "this difference is achieved because of the shift of the molecular levels according to each doped surface . for the n - type surface ( with @xmath41=-4.8 ev ) , the electronic molecular levels are energetically located inside the energy gap of the silicon surface , so there is no channel available for the electronic transport at low positive bias ( see di / dv curve for n - type surface in fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "another result , shows the influence of the tip in the electronic transport , where if the tip is changed , the ndr effect could be diminished with respect to the flat electrode . in order to compare both conditions ,",
    "we have used a similar molecule - tip / electrode distance ( 5 angs . ) .",
    "this can be understood from the potential created by the tip - surface , which is smaller than the potential created by the electrode - surface case .",
    "a smaller electric field created for a sharp tip promotes a very small shift of the energy levels of the molecule and then it is more difficult to move the states to the energy interval associated to the energy gap of si[111 ] . for the second configuration ( b case ) , the situation is rather different because there is no ndr when the undoped surface is considered .",
    "this can be concluded by observing that the main peak occurs at 0.7 ev above @xmath47 and therefore can not be used as an electronic channel due to the energy gap of the si[111 ] .",
    "also , to control the ndr effect , we have considered doped surfaces , where it is possible to detect the ndr effect for the p - type surface but not for the n - type case .",
    "this difference is explained because the number of the channels available , and close to the fermi level , is lesser for the undoped surface than for the p - type surface .",
    "then the shifting of the states produced by the applied bias diminishes the contribution of the peak that is energetically displaced to the energy gap of the doped surface . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , we can see that the undoped surface and the n - type case do not show important peaks close to the fermi level in the di / dv characteristics and the most important contribution comes from the state located 2.3 ev above @xmath47 .",
    "if we consider the p - type surface , we can see not only the contribution given by the states related to the dangling bonds of the surface around the fermi level , but also one peak located at 0.7 ev above @xmath47 and another one at 2.5 ev above @xmath47 .",
    "+ in summary , the extended h@xmath50ckel model , used to describe the electronic properties in the system , it is in good agreement when compared with _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we have found two stable configurations for the styrene molecule in contact with the surface and both of them can provide interesting properties like the ndr effect .",
    "this effect is modulated not only by the electronic molecular levels but also their positions respect to the energy gap of the silicon surface .",
    "a semiconductor surface has interesting properties respect to metallic ones , allowing to control transport with the appropriate conditions like doping . in our case",
    ", we have a ndr effect of the system at low positive voltage .",
    "this effect is also more important when a strong electric field has been considered to shift the molecular states ( flat electrode produces a stronger electric field than a sharp tip ) . the comparison between flat and sharp electrodes has been performed for both configurations finding the same ndr suppression when a sharp metallic tip is considered .",
