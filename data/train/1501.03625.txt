    "in former works z - pinches have been used as plasma targets in scientific fields like the research on inertial confinement fusion , high energy density physics and accelerator development @xcite .",
    "plenty of achievements have been obtained in these scientific fields .",
    "as the z - pinch is a capacitive discharge between two electrodes , erosion plays an important role in the lifetime limitation of such devices .",
    "therefore the z - pinch is not the optimal choice for high repetition rate applications e.g. as a plasma stripper .",
    "however , an inductively coupled plasma device has the advantage to use external coils without contact with the plasma to initiate and maintain the gas ionization .",
    "the so called theta - pinch combines the high lifetime with the free electron density comparable to those of z - pinches @xcite .    conventional small scale theta pinch devices have been broadly investigated in various applications @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy transfer efficiency was determined to be 59% @xcite .",
    "however , in 2008 , a spherical theta pinch with the significantly advanced energy transfer efficiency up to 80% was realized by c. teske and j. jacoby @xcite .",
    "later on , the efficiency was raised to 86% @xcite .",
    "all these results for the energy transfer efficiency were calculated out by applying the model first proposed by s. aisenberg in 1964 @xcite .",
    "the key parameter for the plasma stripper is the free electron density . to achieve the higher free electron density ,",
    "the method is to upgrade the device .",
    "however , the remaining difficulty is how to forecast the electron density after upgrading .",
    "fortunately , a linear scaling law between the free electron density and the deposited energy in plasma was shown in @xcite . to derive the electron density ,",
    "the knowledge of the precise energy transfer efficiency values is essential . reviewing the former energy transfer efficiency models @xcite ,",
    "all of them contains an inaccurate assumption that the reflected plasma resistant is constant .",
    "such treatment is to solve the differential equation which will be well described in this article . to obtain the precise results , a new model based on the experimental measurement",
    "is proposed .",

    "the device axis is positioned horizontally to match the ion beam direction . to achieve a higher electron density , six capacitors with each a capacitance of 25 @xmath0f",
    "are used , being connected parallelly in three groups of two capacitors connected in series .",
    "this setting results in a total capacitance of 37.5 @xmath0 f with a maximum charging voltage of 18 kv . to satisfy the demand of a long life - time",
    "even at high repetition rates , the maximum operation voltage is limited to 14 kv .",
    "nevertheless , this means a maximum of 3.7 kj stored energy in the capacitors which is almost twice as much as in the previous setup @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the thyristor - stack is also improved for adapting the operation voltage of 14 kv . besides , the bigger glass vessel of the 6000 @xmath1 discharge volume is closely encircled by a seven - turns coil .",
    "the capacitors , the switch , the transmission line and the coil form a typical lrc ( inductance , resistance and capacitance ) circuit with a resonance frequency of about 10 khz .",
    "a mixture of mainly argon and 2.2% hydrogen is used as a working gas and the pressure is measured by a full range pressure gauge . as a diagnostic tool ,",
    "a fast photo diode is installed to monitor the plasma .",
    "in addition , a rogowski coil measures the circuit current in the transmission line .",

    "@xmath4 is the inductance of the coil while @xmath5 represents the reflected plasma resistance which is the transformed value from the real plasma resistance into the lrc circuit .",
    "@xmath6 is the total capacitance of the capacitor bank with the initial charging voltage @xmath7 . under the frame of this equivalent circuit , the traditional and the new models are derived as follows .",

    "finally , the energy transfer efficiency @xmath26 from the capacitors to the plasma is @xmath27      in this modification , it is assumed that the plasma start time @xmath28 indicated by the light emission from the plasma is not the same as the current .",

    ", the energy deposited in the plasma is approximated as @xmath32 correspondingly , the modified energy transfer efficiency formula is attained as @xmath33      in the preceding models , the expressions for the energy transfer efficiency are both based on the assumption that the reflected plasma resistance is constant . since the light signal oscillates with time shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : light_signal ] , neither the plasma parameters nor the value of the reflected plasma resistance can be constant . hence , the traditional models contain the risk of deviating from the true value .",
    "to avoid this risk , a new model without any assumption is established . the key point for this new model",
    "is that the parasitic resistance is constant as fig .",
    "[ fig : parasitic_resistance ] shows , for the experimentally measured values . moreover , since the capacitance and inductance do not consume the energy , the total energy is completely dissipated in the parasitic resistance and the reflected plasma resistance . as a result , the energy deposited in the plasma is @xmath34 where @xmath23 is the total energy stored in the capacitors ; @xmath35 is a constant time interval between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the measured current value at @xmath36 .",
    "even though @xmath35 is considered to be infinitesimally small , the sum is used to take into account the finite time resolution of the oscilloscope . for our experiment ,",
    "the substitution error is less than 0.01% .    for the free oscillation , the total energy which is completely dissipated in the parasitic resistance is @xmath39 here",

    "this `` zero shot '' represents the free oscillation of the current . the black line in fig .",
    "[ decay_constant ] shows this kind of free oscillation at 6 kv .",
    "the red line displaying a good overlap with the black one is the fitting curve .",

    "analogously , the decay constants for the different pressures are obtained .    directly applying eq .   from the s.",
    "aisenberg s model on these decay constants , the corresponding energy transfer efficiencies for the different gas pressures are calculated . for the c. teske s modified model ,",
    "another parameter besides the decay constants is the plasma start time @xmath28 .",
    "this is obtained from the difference between the beginning of the light emission in time and the current start time .",
    "then , adopting eq .",
    ", the modified energy transfer efficiencies are also computed .",
    "both of the preceding models need the plotting and fitting procedures which cause propagating errors .",
    "however , for our new model , there is no need to plot and fit the data because eq",
    ".   is straightforwardly applied on the measured current values from the data sheet .",
    "consequently , the energy transfer efficiencies are derived from this .",
    "a comparison is made among the results from these models at 6 kv shown in fig .",
    "[ three_models ] .",
    "their tendencies are extremely similar . at low pressures ,",
    "the curves rise very fast",
    ". then they slow down at medium pressures .",
    "finally , all of them suddenly drop down to the point of 60 pa which is approximated the breakdown threshold .",
    "the biggest difference among the models can be found at medium pressures over a wide range .",
    "the s. aisenberg model shows the highest efficiencies whereas the c. teske s gives the lowest in this pressure range .",
    "the maximum energy transfer efficiency for the s. aisenberg s model is 78% while 52% for c. teske",
    "s modified model . in our new model ,",
    "the value for the maximum energy transfer efficiency is 71% . due to no assumption made in the new model ,",
    "it is considered reliable and precise .",
    "hence , the s. aisenberg s model overestimates the energy transfer efficiency . on the contrary , the c. teske s modification model underestimates the values .",
    "these deviations for the traditional models are mainly caused by the assumption that the reflected plasma resistance is constant , which is untrue .",
    "the truth is the reflected plasma resistance varies with time as the light signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : light_signal ] shows .",
    "however , this assumed constant reflected plasma resistance leads to an approximately average value for the true time - dependent resistance . regarding the energy consumed in the plasma , it does not only depend on the resistance but also the square of the current .",
    "namely , the square of the current is the weighting factor of the resistance for calculating the transferred energy . due to the oscillation decay behavior of the current , the weighting factor for",
    "the first half wave is bigger than for the other half waves .",
    "unfortunately , the resistance for the first half wave is almost zero indicated by the light signal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : light_signal ] .",
    "consequently , the calculated energy transfer by applying the average resistance is overestimated .",
    "this accounts for the s. aisenberg s model s overestimation . for c.teskes modified model , this first half wave of the current",
    "is omitted for calculating the transferred energy according to the eq .",
    ". however , the calculation of the average resistance still counts in this first half wave where the reflected plasma resistance is almost 0 .",
    "this results in the underestimation of the average resistance . correspondingly , the transferred energy calculation is underestimated . besides , the neglection of the sine term in eq",
    ".   also contributes to this energy underestimation .",
    "for instance at 30 pa and 6 kv , the maximum deviation for this sine term is about 3% .    due to the advantage of our new model and the faults of the traditional models ,",
    "our new model is adapted to calculate the energy transfer efficiency from the measured current values .",
    "[ energy_transfer_efficiencies ] shows all the measured energy transfer efficiencies vary with the pressures of the different operation voltages . in our measured pressure range ,",
    "the breakdown threshold is only observed at the lower voltage of 6 and 7 kv . for each voltage",
    ", the pressure corresponding to the peak value of the efficiency is defined as the optimal pressure which shows the maximum transfer efficiency . comparing all of the plots in fig .",
    "[ energy_transfer_efficiencies ] , it is found that the optimal gas pressure shifts to higher values when the voltage is increased .",
    "the maximum energy transfer efficiency found here is 73% which occurs at around 80 pa under the maximum voltage of 14 kv .",
    "a new model is proposed to calculate the energy transfer efficiency of theta pinch in general and especially for the spherical theta pinch .",
    "as this new model contains no assumptions , the results obtained with it are considered exact .",
    "the deviations of the traditional models of s.aisenberg and c.teske from the real values are mainly caused by the improper assumption that the reflected plasma resistance is constant .",
    "the first leads to overestimation whereas the latter to underestimation .",
    "the corresponding explanations are given respectively .",
    "the latest setup of the spherical theta pinch that is used for the presented investigations has a maximum energy transfer efficiency of 73% for an argon - hydrogen gas mixture which is promising especially for high repetition rate applications e.g. flash lamps or a plasma stripping device .",
