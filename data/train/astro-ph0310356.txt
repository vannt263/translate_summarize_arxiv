    "we have analyzed 18 xmm - fields located near the south galactic pole ( sgp ; ra = @xmath4 @xmath5 , dec = @xmath6 @xmath7 ; total of 9 fields ) and in the north galactic pole ( ngp ; ra = @xmath8 @xmath9 , dec = @xmath10 @xmath7 ; total of 9 fields ) , covering an area of @xmath11 and with exposure time between 2 and 10 ksec .",
    "we have excluded 4 southern fields and 1 northern field because of the high particle background .    in order to detect extended emission",
    "we use the wavelet - based xmm - sas source detection task ewavelet , with a detection threshold of @xmath12 , in combination with the emldetect task with an extension probability > 0.995 .",
    "we detect : i ) 5 candidate southern clusters in the mos1 and mos2 mosaic and 3 extended sources in the pn ( out of which 3 overlap with the mos detections ) and ii ) 6 candidate northern clusters in the mos1 and mos2 mosaic , 1 in mos1 only and 5 extended sources in the pn ( out of which 3 overlap with the mos detections ) .",
    "the faintest extended source has a flux of @xmath13 2 @xmath14 10@xmath15 cgs , as estimated by the emldetect task .",
    "visual inspection suggests that the small overlap between the pn and the mos detected cluster candidates can be attributed to ( i ) the presence of gaps in the pn and ( ii ) the elevated particle background of this detector .    for the ngp cluster candidates we compare the photometric redshift distribution ( from sdss ) within a circular region of @xmath16 - @xmath17 centered on the x - ray position with that of the field .",
    "this preliminary analysis suggests an overdensity of optical galaxies at photometric redshifts z @xmath13 0.4 in excess to the expectations from the rosati et al 2002 luminosity function .    in the figures we present the xmm epic ( mosaic of mos1 and mos2 ) contours of 2 of the candidate clusters , overlaid on the optical images , using the dss and the sdss for the southern and northern fields respectively .",
    "we fitted to each cluster a king profile using fixed values for the @xmath18 parameter ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "we then estimated the flux of each cluster by integrating their king profile to infinity and we found that the lower cluster luminosity is @xmath21 . varying",
    "the @xmath18 parameter between 0.7 - 1 translates to a @xmath22 change in @xmath23 .",
    "we also found that the range of the cluster temperatures is between 1 - 3 kev .    to test the reliability of our procedure",
    "we have performed simulations of the expected cluster detection on xmm epic , using the rosati et al ( 2002 ) @xmath3 and the sas simulator ( scisim ) .",
    "we find that we should expect roughly @xmath24 clusters per field with f @xmath25 2 @xmath14 10@xmath15cgs , which is in rough agreement with our number of detected clusters ."
