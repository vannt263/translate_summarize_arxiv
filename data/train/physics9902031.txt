    "<S> two - photon detachment from the @xmath0 negative ion has been investigated within the lowest order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in accordance with the adiabatic theory a proper asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath1 bound state wave function is crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the multiphoton detachment cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the latter are substantially higher than it was previously believed .    in the recent papers by gribakin and kuchiev ( 1997a , 1997b ) </S>",
    "<S> an adiabatic analytical theory of multiphoton detachment from negative ions has been developed , based on the keldysh approach ( keldysh 1964 ) . </S>",
    "<S> simple analytical expressions obtained there for the differential and total @xmath2-photon detachment cross sections allow one to estimate them for any negative ion . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important points of that work is that the electron escape from the atomic system in a low - frequency laser field takes place at large distances , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the photon frequency , @xmath5 is related to the initial bound state energy , @xmath6 , and @xmath2 is the number of quanta absorbed ( atomic units are used throughout ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the multiphoton detachment rates are determined by the long - range asymptotic behaviour of the bound - state wave function , namely by the asymptotic parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 of the bound state radial wave function @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been obtained using the length form of the interaction with the laser field , which proves to be the most convenient for multiphoton processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the analytical adiabatic approach is valid for _ multiphoton _ detachment processes , i.e. , strictly speaking , for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the calculations for h@xmath10 and halogen negative ions indicate ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , kuchiev and ostrovsky 1998 ) that the analytical formulae should give reasonable answers even for @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present work is to verify these conclusions by doing direct numerical calculations of the 2-photon detachment cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we examine the sensitivity of the photodetachment cross sections to the asymptotic behaviour of the ground state wavefunction and show that it is indeed very strong . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a `` small '' 20% error in @xmath5 present in the hartree - fock ( hf ) wave function of the fluorine negative ion results in a factor of three underestimation of the 2-photon cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this emphasizes the need to use bound - state wavefunctions with correct asymptotic behaviour in calculations of multiphoton processes .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the 2-photon detachment amplitudes , cross sections and photoelectron angular distribution using the lowest - order perturbation theory and compare the results obtained with different ground state wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we present and analyze the results for the f@xmath12 negative ion , where the results of a few other theoretical calculations ( robinson and geltman 1967 , crance 1987a , b , pan 1990 , pan and starace 1991 , van der hart 1996 ) as well as experimental data ( kwon 1989 , blondel 1992 , blondel and delsart 1993 ) are known . </S>",
    "<S> pan and pan and starace calculated the two - photon detachment cross section and photoelectron angular distribution in the hf approximation ( similar to that used by crance ) and with the account of first - order electron correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> their results show that the correlation corrections are about 15% for the partial and total cross sections and almost negligible for the angular distribution parameters , when the dipole length form is used .    </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section of the two - photon detachment of an electron from an atomic system by a linearly polarized light of frequency @xmath4 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the partial cross section for the detachment into the final state with the photoelectron orbital momentum @xmath15 and the total orbital momentum @xmath16 , and the continuous spectrum wave function of the photoelectron is normalized to the @xmath17-function of energy . for the @xmath1 electron detachment from f@xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> the final state can be either @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) or @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two - photon amplitude @xmath25 is determined by the following equations @xmath26    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the intermediate electron state with the orbital momentum @xmath29 after absorbing the first photon ( @xmath30 for f@xmath12 ) , and @xmath31 is the initial bound state . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced dipole matrix elements are defined in the usual way , e.g. in the length form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 s are the radial wave functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the photoelectron angular distribution is described by the differential cross section @xmath35 where @xmath36 is measured with respect to the light polarization axis , and the asymmetry parameters @xmath37 are defined in terms of the two - photon transition amplitudes @xmath38 and scattering phases of the photoelectron @xmath39 : @xmath40 \\sqrt{[l_f^\\prime ] [ l^\\prime ] [ l_f^{\\prime \\prime } ] [ l^{\\prime \\prime } ] } \\nonumber \\\\ \\times   \\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } l_f^\\prime & 2j & l_f^{\\prime \\prime } \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\left (   \\begin{array}{ccc } l^\\prime   & 2j & l^{\\prime \\prime } \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{ccc } l^\\prime & l^{\\prime \\prime } & 2j \\\\ l_f^{\\prime \\prime } & l_f^\\prime & l_0 \\end{array } \\right\\ } a_{l_f^\\prime l^\\prime } a^*_{l_f^{\\prime \\prime } l^{\\prime \\prime } } \\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41\\equiv 2l+1 $ ] and @xmath42 , so that the photoelectron angular distribution after a two - photon detachment is characterized by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    the self - consistent hf calculation of the f@xmath12 ground state yields the @xmath1-electron energy @xmath45 ryd , which is much lower than its true value equal to the negative of the experimental electron affinity of f : @xmath46 ryd ( radtzig and smirnov 1986 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is often assumed that the hf radial wavefunction is still a good starting point for calculations of multiphoton detachment , if the experimental binding energy is used in lieu of the hf value ( crance 1987a , b , pan 1990 ) . </S>",
    "<S> pan ( 1990 ) showed that the two - photon detachment cross sections obtained with the dipole operator in the velocity form are very sensitive to the @xmath1-electron energy , while the length form results change little when the hf energy is replaced by the experimental one . </S>",
    "<S> however , one should use not only use the correct energy but , which is much more important , the bound state wavefunction with the correct asymptotic behaviour by liu ( 1992 ) , where a 3.4% change of @xmath5 results in a 25% change of the 2-photon cross section . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of large distances , where one can use the correct asymptotic form of the bound - state wave function , speaks strongly in favour of using the length form of the dipole operator ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a ) . to correct the @xmath1 wavefunction we solved the hf equations for the f@xmath12 ground state with an additional small repulsive potential @xmath47 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we chose @xmath48 and @xmath49  au to ensure that the @xmath1 energy was equal to the experimental value . the hf and </S>",
    "<S> corrected @xmath1 radial wavefunctions @xmath50 are presented in figure [ functions](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between them appears to be small  it does not exceed 10% near the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> their asymptotic behaviour @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath52 and 0.86 , and @xmath53 and 0.5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in @xmath5 means that the two wavefunctions are in fact quite different at large distances .    </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions of the intermediate ( @xmath28 ) and final ( @xmath54 ) states of the photoelectron are calculated in the hf field of the frozen neutral @xmath55 core . </S>",
    "<S> the photoelectron is coupled to the core to form the total spin @xmath56 and angular momentum @xmath16 : @xmath57 for the intermediate @xmath58 states , @xmath59 for @xmath21 , and @xmath23 for @xmath60 final states . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate states continua are discretized and represented by a 70-state momentum grid with constant spacing @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways of calculating the two - photon amplitudes @xmath62 of equation ( [ me2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first is by direct summation over the intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> it involves a non - trivial evaluation of the free - free dipole matrix elements together with the accurate treatment of pole- and @xmath17-type singularities ( korol 1994 , 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> another way of calculating such sums is by solving an inhomogeneous schrdinger - type equation for the effective radial function of the intermediate state @xmath63 ( sternheimer 1951 , dalgarno and lewis 1955 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this wavefunction describes the amplitude of finding the electron at different distances from the atom after absorption of the first quantum . </S>",
    "<S> after calculation of @xmath64 the amplitude is obtained from the radial integral as @xmath65 in the present work we calculate the two - photon amplitudes using both techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is especially simple below the single - photon detachment threshold , @xmath66 , where @xmath64 drops exponentially at large distances : @xmath67 , where @xmath68^{1/2}$ ] . at finite distances @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> it can be computed easily by direct numerical summation in equation ( [ sh ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to look at the shape of the effective wavefunction @xmath64 . as an example , figure [ functions](b ) shows this function calculated for the intermediate @xmath70 electron at @xmath71 ryd for the hf ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath64 is shifted towards large radii , compared to the maximum of the ground state wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> also shown in figure [ functions](b ) are the radial wavefunction of the final @xmath72-wave electron ( @xmath73 ryd ) and the integrand @xmath74 of equation ( [ dme1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these plots illustrate the point that the two - photon amplitude @xmath75 is indeed determined by large electron - atom separations ( [ large ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the correct asymptotic behaviour of the ground state wavefunction is crucial .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we compare the cross sections and angular asymmetry parameters calculated in different approximations with both the hf and corrected @xmath1 wavefunctions ( figure [ functions](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us first discuss the results obtained with the hf energy of the @xmath1 electron . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to the two - photon threshold @xmath76 ryd . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section calculated from equations ( [ cr])([me2 ] ) using the hf functions of the initial , intermediate and final states are shown in figure [ crosssec ] by a short - dashed line . it is very similar to the dipole length lowest - order hf results of pan ( 1990 ) , although the latter are about 10% lower than ours . </S>",
    "<S> what is the source of this discrepancy ? </S>",
    "<S> pan used the roothaan - hf expansion of the bound state . </S>",
    "<S> this form of the bound - state wavefunction has an incorrect asymptotic behaviour at @xmath77 , see figure [ functions](a ) , inset . because of the importance of large electron - atom separations in the multiphoton processes even a small error in the wave function could lead to some inaccuracies in the 2-photon detachment amplitudes . in the work of pan electron correlation effects </S>",
    "<S> were calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that they suppress the cross section in f@xmath10 by about 20% at the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> these results shown in figure [ crosssec ] by open squares are still close to the hf curve .    </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic parameters of the hf @xmath1 wave function are @xmath78 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we use them in the adiabatic theory formula ( equation ( 5 ) of gribakin and kuchiev 1997b ) and obtain the cross section shown in figure [ crosssec ] by solid dots . </S>",
    "<S> it reproduces the energy dependence of the hf cross section well , though overestimates its magnitude by a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> this is a reasonable result , since the adiabatic theory should only be valid for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations of gribakin and kuchiev ( 1997a ) showed that for h@xmath10 and @xmath79 the analytical adiabatic results are already 20% accurate . </S>",
    "<S> there are two approximations made in the adiabatic theory : ( i ) the use of the volkov wavefunction to describe the photoelectron , and ( ii ) the saddle - point calculation of the integral over time , which enables one to express the amplitude in terms of the asymptotic parameters of the bound state . in the weak - field regime the use of the volkov function is equivalent to the the so - called ` free - electron ' approximation ( examined earlier by crance ) . in this approximation </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions of the photoelectron in the intermediate and final states are described by plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> when we do such calculation for f@xmath10 ( chain curve in figure [ crosssec ] ) the results turn out to be very close to those of the adiabatic theory . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the approximation ( ii ) of the adiabatic theory is in fact quite good even at @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> when we use the experimental energy of the @xmath1 electron together with the hf wavefunctions the magnitude of the 2-photon cross section changes very little ( dashed line in figure [ crosssec ] ) , as seen earlier by pan ( 1990 ) for both hf and correlated results ( open circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hf results of crance ( 1987a ) are close to the above , and the cross section of van der hart ( 1996 ) is also similar , with a maximum of 1.27 au at @xmath80 ryd </S>",
    "<S> .    however , when we use the corrected @xmath1 wavefunction , the photodetachment cross section increases more than three times . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown by solid line in figure [ crosssec ] , and we consider this to be the best evaluation of the cross section for f@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the cusp on the curve corresponds to the single - photon threshold of the @xmath81-wave single - photon detachment from f@xmath10 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the same increase is also demonstrated by the adiabatic theory ( with modified asymptotic parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) and the plane - wave results . as we explained earlier , </S>",
    "<S> this `` surprising '' sensitivity of the multiphoton detachment probabilities to the asymptotic form of the bound - state wavefunction is a direct consequence of the dominant role of large electron - atom separations in this problem ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the error induced by the use of an asymptotically incorrect wave function can be estimated within the adiabatic approach . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that if one uses the experimental binding energy @xmath6 together with an incorrect bound state @xmath84 , the @xmath2-photon cross section acquires an error factor @xmath85 where @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation implies that the relative error in the amplitude is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the large radius from equation ( [ large ] ) . for @xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> the error factor is smaller than unity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , using a stronger bound wave function leads to an underestimation of the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> for f@xmath10 the factor ( [ err ] ) calculated for @xmath90 and @xmath91 au near the cross section maximum , yields 0.33 . </S>",
    "<S> this value agrees with the difference between the cross sections observed in figure [ crosssec ] . </S>",
    "<S> the only other work that used an asymptotically correct @xmath1 wave function was the model potential calculation of robinson and geltman ( 1967 ) , which produced a cross section two times greater than those of crance , pan and van der hart .    to estimate the size of possible errors introduced by our way of correcting the @xmath1 wavefunction we have examined the dependence of our cross section on the choice of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the repulsive potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as long as the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath1 state remains correct , the two - photon cross sections are always proportional to that shown by the solid line in figure [ crosssec ] . </S>",
    "<S> different pairs of @xmath92 and @xmath93 result in the variation of @xmath7 , and the magnitude of the cross section is simply proportional to @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> our value of @xmath83 is close to @xmath95 from radtsig and smirnov ( 1986 ) and we are sure that our results are basically correct . </S>",
    "<S> even a large 10% uncertainty in the value of @xmath7 would mean a maximal 20% error in the cross section . in any case the cross section will be much larger than those obtained with the hf @xmath1 ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between experimental and hf values of the @xmath1 energy is a manifestation of electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it influences the result via the asymptotic behaviour of the ground - state wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> this is by far the most important correlation effect in multiphoton detachment . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the asymptotically correct @xmath1 wavefunction changes the cross section by a factor of three , which is much greater than other correlation effects ( pan 1990 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact distinguishes this problem from the single - photon processes , where other correlation effects are essential .    </S>",
    "<S> the angular asymmetry parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 calculated using the experimental @xmath1 energy are shown in figure [ angasym ] , together with the correlated length results of pan and starace ( 1991 ) and experimental points of blondel and delsart ( 1993 ) at @xmath96 ryd . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry parameters ( [ beta ] ) are relative quantities , and the results of different calculations are much closer for them than for the absolute values of the photodetachment cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic theory is again in good agreement with the plane - wave approximation , especially in @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that this parameter is on the whole less sensitive to the details of the calculation , because it is simply proportional to the amplitude of @xmath97 wave emission , and there is no interference in the sum in equation ( [ beta ] ) for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values of @xmath98 for f@xmath10 obtained in the earlier work of blondel ( 1992 ) are close to those of blondel and delsart ( 1993 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is why f@xmath10 serves as a good benchmark for angular asymmetry calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the perfect agreement between adiabatic theory and the experiment is probably fortuitous . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ angasym ] indicates that for the experiment to be able to distinguish between various theoretical data one would wish to make measurements at higher photon energies , where the results of different approximations diverge .    from the theoretical point of view </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the total cross sections and the angular asymmetry parameters are determined by different physical features of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute size of the cross sections is very sensitive to the asymptotic behaviour of the bound state wave function . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity _ increases _ for large-@xmath2 processes , when @xmath4 become smaller , as suggested by estimate ( [ err ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections also depend on the atomic potential which acts on the photoelectron , hence the difference between the results obtained with the hf and plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> this latter effect is _ suppressed _ for larger @xmath2 , since this re - scattering of the photoelectron is inversely proportional to some power of large @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the angular asymmetry parameters are affected by the electron - atom potential via the scattering phaseshifts @xmath39 . however , for large @xmath2 and small photoelectron energy @xmath100 the phaseshifts should be close to integer multiples of @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> besides that , contributions of higher partial waves become dominant . </S>",
    "<S> they are almost unaffected by the atomic potential and the adiabatic theory should become very accurate .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown by direct numerical calculations that in agreement with the adiabatic theory , the multiphoton detachment rates are very sensitive to the asymptotic behaviour of the bound state wavefunction . for fluorine </S>",
    "<S> this means that the true 2-photon detachment cross sections are substantially higher than it was believed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy revealed is much greater than other electron correlation effects .    </S>",
    "<S> this work was supported by the australian research council . </S>",
    "<S> one of us ( vki ) would like to acknowledge the hospitality extended to him at the school of physics at the university of new south wales , and the support of his visit by the gordon godfrey fund . </S>"
