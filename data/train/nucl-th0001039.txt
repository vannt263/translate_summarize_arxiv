    "the restriction to the pair - field has the advantage that its symmetries show up directly in the spectra , which are qualitatively different for the various symmetry types .",
    "the pair - field appears when the mean - field approximation is applied , which results in the hartree - fock - bogolubov ( hfb ) equations @xmath6    where @xmath7 the quantities in the brackets @xmath8 in ( [ hfbg ] ) and ( [ hfbd ] ) are the antisymmetric uncoupled matrix elements of the interaction . in eq .",

    "the proton - proton ( pp ) pair - field has @xmath24 and the neutron - neutron ( nn ) has @xmath25 .",
    "there are two proton - neutron ( pn ) pair - fields with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we use the lower case letters @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the isospin of the pair - field in order to avoid confusion with the isospin of the states , which we denote by @xmath28 and @xmath17 .",
    "let us restrict to the simple case of one @xmath29-shell , for which the symmetries become most obvious .",

    "field has also a large matrix element but there is only one such state in the @xmath29-shell .",

    "we shall proceed with the assumption that for @xmath38 the @xmath2 nuclei have a @xmath0 pair - field at low spin .",
    "this assumption is supported by the experiments with two - particle transfer reactions on these nuclei . as reviewed by bes , broglia , hansen and nathan @xcite",
    ", the observed cross section can be very convincingly be interpreted in terms of a @xmath0 pair - field .",
    "a dynamic picture of the field is used and multi - boson excitations are considered .",
    "we shall stay within the static hfb approach and consider the consequences of the @xmath0 pair - field for the energy spectra .",
    "the following discussion is based on the material in ref.@xcite .",
    "the pair - potential @xmath39 has the same symmetries as the pairing - tensor @xmath40 , because the interaction is an invariant with respect to the symmetry operations . for @xmath0 monopole pairing",
    "we have @xmath41 it is a vector in isospace in spherical representation .",
    "the pair - potential @xmath42 can be written in an analogous way .",
    "the original two - body hamiltonian conserves the isospin ( we neglect the coulomb interaction ) .",
    "it is a scalar with respect to rotations in isospace .",
    "we consider the case @xmath43",
    ". then @xmath44 .",
    "the mean field routhian @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "( [ hfbh ] ) ) consists of isoscalar terms , except the pair - potential , which is an isovector .",
    "therefore , it breaks the isospin symmetry spontaneously      before discussing the breaking of the symmetry by the isovector pair - field , it is useful to state the familiar case of spontaneous breaking of the spatial isotropy by a mean - field solution with a deformed density distribution ( c.f .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since the two - body hamiltonian is isotropic , this symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "there is a family of mean - field solutions with the same energy which correspond to different orientations of the density distribution .",
    "all represent one and the same intrinsic quasiparticle configuration , which is not an eigenfunction of the total angular momentum .",
    "any of these solutions can be chosen as the intrinsic state .",
    "the principal axes of its density distribution define the body - fixed coordinate system .",
    "the states of good angular - momentum are superpositions of these states of different orientation , the weight being given by the wigner @xmath46-functions .",
    "thus , the relative importance of the different orientations is fixed by restoring the angular - momentum symmetry . at the simplest level of the cranking model , which is valid for sufficiently strong symmetry breaking ,",
    "the energy of the good angular - momentum state is given by the mean - field value .",
    "let us now consider a @xmath0 hfb solution found for the @xmath43 system .",
    "the @xmath0 pair - field @xmath42 is a vector that points in a certain direction in isospace , breaking the isospin symmetry .",
    "since the two - body hamiltonian is isospin invariant , the symmetry is a spontaneously broken and all orientations of the isovector pair - field : @xmath47 are equivalent .",
    "[ delta.fig ] illustrates this family of hfb solutions , the energy of which does not depend on the orientation of the pair - field . in particular",
    ", the cases of a pure pn- field ( z - axis ) and pure pp- and nn - pair - fields ( y - axis ) represent the same intrinsic state .",
    "hence , at the mean - field level the ratio between the strengths of pp- , nn- and pn- pair - fields is given by the orientation of the pair - field , which is not determined by the hfb procedure .",
    "the relative strengths of the three types of pair - correlations becomes only definite when the isospin symmetry is restored .",
    "the symmetry breaking by the isovector pair - field has been discussed before in @xcite , where references to earlier work can be found .",
    "the most simple way to restore the symmetry is the above discussed rotor limit , which assumes that the rotation is slow as compared with the intrinsic motion . for the isospace it was discussed in @xcite . in essence",
    "it amounts to pick one of the orientations of @xmath48 and call this the intrinsic state .",
    "the direction of the y - axis , corresponding to @xmath49 , is particular useful , as will be discussed below .",
    "the symmetry conserving wavefunction is a product of this intrinsic state and wigner @xmath46-function , which is the probability amplitude of the different orientations of the intrinsic state in isospin . for @xmath50 states it is a constant .",
    "all orientations of @xmath42 are equally probable , corresponding to an equal amount of pn- , pp- and nn- correlation energy . in this way",
    "the pn- pair - field reappears via restoration of the isospin symmetry , although the intrinsic state has only the pp- andd nn- pair - fields . for states @xmath51 ,",
    "the @xmath46-function becomes more and more peaked in the y - direction , i. e. with increasing @xmath28 the orientations with @xmath52 become less and less probable .",
    "this simple pair - rotational scheme is completely analogous to the familiar rotational bands .",
    "the intrinsic excitations represent the @xmath50 states .",
    "the energies of states with larger isospin are @xmath53 the moment of inertia for the isorotation can be calculated by means of the cranking procedure .",
    "one solves the hfb eqs . for a finite",
    "`` frequency '' @xmath54 and calculates @xmath55 the moment of inertia is approximately proportional to the level density at the fermi surface .",
    "realistic interactions or shell model potentials are tuned such that the experimental level density is well reproduced .",
    "hence , the pair - rotational energy , which is a combination of symmetry and the wigner terms of the binding energy , is expected to be reproduced well .",
    "like in the case of spatial rotation , the intrinsic excitations are constructed from the quasi particles ( qps ) belonging to _ one _ of the orientations of pair - field .",
    "we choose the y - direction , @xmath56 .",
    "this is a particularly convenient choice because it permits to reduce the construction of the qp excitation spectrum to the familiar case with no pn - pairing @xcite .",
    "the choice of the qp operators is not unique @xcite .",
    "we choose them to be pure quasi neutrons or quasi protons and denote their creation operators by @xmath57 , where @xmath21 indicates the isospin projection .",
    "they are pairwise degenerate , i.e. the qp routhians @xmath58 are equal .",

    "in particular , the lowest @xmath50 state in odd - odd @xmath43 nuclei is a two - qp excitation and different from the ground state of its even - even neighbor , which is the vacuum .",

    "in such a case , the gap between the ground state and the first excited state is much smaller in the odd - odd nucleus ( 2@xmath39 ) than in the even - even ( 2@xmath149 ) .",
    "it is difficult to derive information about such a weak pair - field from the spectra .",
    "similarly , it seems hard to extract from the spectra clearcut evidence for a mixed pair - field composed of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components , which goodman obtains for one set of input parameters",
    "@xcite .",
    "this type of pair - field is favored by rotation , because it carries .",
    "one may speculate that such a field appears at high spin , where the rotation has destroyed the @xmath0 pairing and made the phase space available for the new type of correlation .",
    "the @xmath150 pair - field has a special symmetry .",
    "it is odd under @xmath151 ( cf .",
    "( [ comn ] ) ) and under @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "( [ coms ] ) ) . therefore it is even under the combination of both and the qp routhian is invariant , @xmath152 there is an analogy to reflection asymmetric axial nuclei @xcite . although both @xmath71 and the space inversion @xmath153 do not leave the qp routhian invariant , the combination @xmath154 does , which implies the quantum number simplex .",
    "the bands are @xmath155 sequences of alternating parity .",
    "the simplex determines which parity belongs to @xmath156 . in the same way @xmath157 implies the quantum number @xmath5 @xmath158 which takes the values 0 and 1 for even @xmath16 and @xmath159 for odd @xmath16 . refering to the analogy with the simplex we suggest the name gauge - simplex or shorter gaugeplex",
    "it relates the parity of the neutron number ( or proton number ) with the signature @xmath73 , @xmath160 here we used @xmath161 .",
    "a strong @xmath150 pair - field implies that adjacent even - even and odd - odd nuclei join into a pair - rotational band of fixed gaugeplex .",
    "this means that the even-@xmath156 states become similar to the odd-@xmath156 states of the neighbor and vice versa .    in order to investigate this interesting structure we carried out shell model calculations for our study case of a @xmath69-shell . in order to enhance the @xmath1 correlations we modified the interaction .",
    "only the odd-@xmath32 multipoles of the @xmath162-interaction , which have @xmath1 , were taken into account ( @xmath1 @xmath162 -interaction )",
    "[ pn44.fig ] and [ pn33.fig ] show the results .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath163 the spectra of the systems @xmath164 and @xmath165 become very similar if the states of opposite signature are compared .",
    "the similarity may be ascribed to a gradual built up of the @xmath166 correlations caused by the increasing frequency .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the development of a gap between the yrast and yrare state . at @xmath167 , the distances between the lowest routhians are in units of @xmath168 : 2.4 , 1.0 , 1.2 for @xmath165 and 2.2 , 0.9 , 0.9 for @xmath164 .",
    "so far we have not been able to find a self - consistent pair - field in this frequency region .",
    "it is not clear at this point what this means .",
    "the work is very recent",
    ". it may be that we just did not use the right initial wavefunction for the iterative solution of the hfb equations .",
    "it is possible that the pair - correlations are of vibrational type and there is no static hfb solution .",
    "but it could also be that there is a completely different explanation for the similarity .",
    "the spectra of @xmath169 nuclei in the region @xmath38 are consistent with a @xmath0 pair - field at low and moderate spin ( cf .",
    "s. lenzi s lecture at this meeting ) .",
    "this conclusion is in accordance with the analysis of two - particle transfer data , which has already provided strong independent evidence for this type of pair - field @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 pair - field breaks the isotropy with respect to rotations in isospace .",
    "therefore , the mean field solutions must be interpreted as intrinsic states of pair - rotational bands .",
    "this has two consequences .    as intrinsic state",
    ", one may use the orientation in isospace with a zero proton - neutron pair - field .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum looks as if there was no such field . only for @xmath43 certain excitations ( @xmath170 )",
    "are forbidden .",
    "the proton - neutron pair - correlations appear via the restoration of the isospin in the total wavefunction .    on top of each intrinsic state , there is a pair - rotational band .",
    "however , these additional states with @xmath171 lie high in energy . only in the odd - odd @xmath43 nuclei",
    "the first excited pair - rotational state based on the intrinsic ground state has a similar energy as the first excited intrinsic state .",
    "hence the appearance of this low lying @xmath94 rotational band is a consequence of the @xmath0 pair - correlations .    the @xmath1 pair - field , which has other symmetries than the @xmath0 field , leads to a different pattern of excited states . since the pairs carry finite ( @xmath35 is expected to be most important ) one must distinguish between the fields with signature 0 and 1 .    a substantial pair - field with signature 0",
    "would show up as similar spectra in adjacent even - even and odd - odd @xmath43 nuclei .",
    "such a similarity is not seen in the experimental spectra .",
    "it should appear around @xmath172 , where goodman @xcite predicts this type of pair - field at low spin .",
    "the pair - field with signature 1 is favored by rotation .",
    "it may appear at high spin .",
    "a substantial field of this type would show up as similar spectra in adjacent @xmath43 nuclei , provided the odd / even spins in even - even nucleus are compared with the even / odd spins in the odd - odd nucleus .",
