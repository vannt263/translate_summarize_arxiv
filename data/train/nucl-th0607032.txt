    "nucleus - nucleus collisions in the fermi energy domain exhibit a large variety of contributing reaction mechanisms and reaction products ( see e.g. @xcite ) and offer the principal possibility to produce mid - heavy to heavy neutron - rich nuclei in very peripheral collisions . in the reactions of massive heavy ions such as @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn @xcite and @xmath0kr+@xmath4sn @xcite ,",
    "an enhancement was observed over the yields expected in cold fragmentation which is at present the method of choice to produce neutron - rich nuclei . in this case",
    "the neutron - rich nuclei are produced in damped symmetric nucleus - nucleus collisions with intense nucleon exchange leading to the large width of isotopic distributions .",
    "further enhancement of yields of n - rich nuclei was observed in the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath5ni @xcite in the very peripheral collisions , thus pointing to the possible importance of neutron and proton density profiles at the projectile and target surfaces . in @xcite , the model of deep - inelastic transfer",
    "@xcite was supplemented with a phenomenological correction introducing the effect of shell structure on nuclear periphery .",
    "a consistent agreement with experimental data was achieved in the reactions of a 25 amev @xmath0kr beam with three different target nuclei , specifically allowing to describe the deviation of the nucleon exchange from the path toward isospin equilibration .    in this article , we present an investigation of the reaction mechanism of the nucleus - nucleus collisions with an emphasis on the production of fragmentation - like residues at projectile energies around the fermi energy .",
    "the fragmentation - like residues with mass and charge below the projectile can be , according to calculation @xcite , produced at projectile energies around the fermi energy in the process of incomplete fusion .",
    "the difference to high - energy fragmentation as assumed in standard abrasion - ablation model ( @xcite ) is that here the participant zone fuses with one spectator , thus creating a very hot multifragmentation source and the other spectator remains cold .",
    "the cold projectile - like fragment is not emitted at zero angle but due to classical coulomb trajectory along which the collision evolves it appears at larger angles .",
    "the existence of such a cold fragment can be deduced e.g. from the data of casini et al .",
    "@xcite where mass and excitation energy of the projectile - like fragment ( plf ) were kinematically reconstructed and it was established that the products lighter than the projectile are cold and heavier ones are hot .",
    "such dependence can not be explained using the concept of nucleon exchange as represented by the model of deep - inelastic transfer @xcite .",
    "the simulation using the incomplete - fusion ( icf ) code @xcite reproduces such behavior reasonably well , due to low excitation energy of fragmentation - like residues with masses below projectile and considerably higher excitation energy of icf - like residues heavier than projectile .",
    "furthermore , a large amount of detailed data on hot multifragmentation source in various reactions was reproduced , including detailed experimental studies of the mid - velocity source @xcite and single fusion - like source @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath4sn+@xmath6al was used to verify the icf model using heavy residues with masses a=60 - 90 measured with high precision using a fragment separator at forward angles @xcite and both the production cross sections and the n / z trend were reproduced well for these products originating from hot projectile - like icf source . however , little is known on n / z trend of the cold fragments , which can be produced in symmetric reactions of heavy nuclei . in the present paper",
    "we examine such a trend using the experimentally observed heavy residues in reactions @xmath0kr+@xmath7sn at projectile energy 25 amev and refine the model description in order to improve the prediction of the production of exotic ( neutron - rich ) nuclei in nucleus - nucleus collisions around fermi energy .",
    "according to the incomplete fusion model @xcite , in order to study the production of cold fragmentation - like residues around the fermi energy it is necessary to study symmetric nucleus - nucleus collisions of two massive nuclei ( with target comparable or heavier than projectile ) .",
    "the products of interest will be produced at angles away from zero degrees and the measurement at these angles is necessary to observe such products .",
    "furthermore , according to the calculation , the cold fragmentation - like residues should be increasingly dominant products for the channels with the number of stripped protons exceeding seven to eight .",
    "thus the products of primary interest are the heavy residues considerably lighter than the initial projectile , which due to the removal of a significant number of protons can be also considerably neutron - rich .     in the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath4sn at 25 amev @xcite . dashed line - results of the standard simulation @xcite combined with the de - excitation code smm @xcite , solid line - results of simulation using modified model of incomplete fusion ( eq .",

    "[ fgkrsn24 ] , [ fgkrsn12 ] show the comparison of experimental mass distributions ( symbols ) to the results of the simulation ( dashed line ) for the reactions of @xmath0kr with two tin targets .",
    "the simulation uses either the model of deep - inelastic transfer @xcite for peripheral collisions or the model of pre - equilibrium emission and incomplete fusion ( icf ) for violent ( central ) collisions , combined with the de - excitation code smm @xcite .",
    "the simulated yields were filtered for angular acceptance of the separator positioned at @xmath8 with appropriate azimuthal corrections @xcite .",
    "the description of experimental data using the de - excitation code smm , representing the combination of statistical multifragmentation model for highly excited nuclei with evaporation cascade for lower excitation energies , proved consistently better than using the model of sequential binary decay .",
    "analogous calculation , consisting of the model of deep - inelastic transfer for the early stage , combined with the smm , and thus representing only the peripheral collisions , was used for the same reactions in the work @xcite and the yields of nuclei with z = 30 - 35 were reproduced well .",
    "the contribution from the violent collisions is negligible for nuclei with z=30 - 35 and thus description of violent collisions used in the present work does not affect the results for these reaction products .",
    "it is however essential for description of the production of nuclei around nickel and below where the icf contribution becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "one can see that for the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath4sn the calculation overpredicts the experimental yields of the most neutron - rich products below nickel ( with more than 8 stripped protons ) .",
    "the situation is similar also for the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath9sn even if the most neutron - rich products below nickel are less populated than in reaction of @xmath0kr+@xmath4sn .",
    "thus the yields of neutron - rich nuclei appear to be overpredicted in the region where the cold fragmentation - like residues dominate .",
    "a modification of the model of incomplete fusion concerning the cold fragmentation - like residues should be considered , specifically concerning the description of the n / z - trend which was not verified in the past .     in the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath9sn at 25 amev @xcite .",

    "the charge of spectator zones is determined using the combinatorial probability , which is a standard approach in fragmentation codes @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy of the cold fragment is determined considering the two - body collisions of participant and spectator nucleons along the separation plane @xcite .",
    "the concept of combinatorial probability explores the available statistical phase space and allows a rather wide range of isospin asymmetries . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", however , the spectator - participant scenario implies an instantaneous separation and thus preservation of isospin asymmetry of the initial nucleus in the ground state , with homogeneous density in the interior of the nucleus .",
    "thus , the two concepts seem to be in contradiction , which can be resolved when assuming that the change of isospin asymmetry is dynamically consistent with transfer of certain amount of nucleons across the separation plane .",
    "simultaneously , the relative velocity between the participant and spectator zone increases from zero to maximum value corresponding to final incomplete - fusion scenario and thus the transferred nucleons should carry this relative velocity which will be transferred into excitation energy of the acceptor .",
    "thus a component of excitation energy dependent on isospin asymmetry can be deduced .",
    "it can be assumed that , due to absence of coulomb barrier , the nucleons transferred will be predominantly neutrons .",
    "the formula for such isospin dependent component of excitation energy of a cold spectator ( acceptor ) can be written as    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the projectile kinetic energy and mass , @xmath13 is the coulomb barrier , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the projectile velocity and the final relative velocity between hot and cold fragment in the incomplete - fusion scenario , evaluated at the coulomb barrier , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are mass and charge of the spectator ( cold fragment ) , @xmath18(@xmath17 ) is the spectator mass corresponding to n / z of initial nucleus and @xmath19 is a random number between zero and one , generated for each collision .",
    "the random number is introduced due to uncertainty concerning the exact moment of transfer and represents an zero - th order estimate allowing to reproduce the mean value of extra excitation energy due to transfer of neutrons .",
    "the excitation energy is evaluated only in the case when the cold fragment is acceptor ( and thus neutron - rich ) . for the loss of neutrons no such component",
    "is evaluated , thus assuming that neutrons close to the fermi level are lost and no enhancement of intrinsic excitation occurs .",

    "one can see that the overall agreement with the experimental data is improved in the modified calculation compared to the standard one .",
    "the calculation with modification , which is fully consistent with overall description of the nucleus - nucleus collisions and introduces no free parameters , describes the trend of the experimental yields of the most neutron - rich products below nickel for the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath4sn , which the initial calculation overpredicts .",
    "the situation improves also for the reaction @xmath0kr+@xmath9sn . for the most neutron - rich products below chromium nuclei",
    "occasionally appear less populated than it is predicted by the model .",
    "this however can be caused by missing yield in the experiment due to high background from the initial beam , because of increasing overlap of the charge states ( in terms of magnetic rigidity ) with charge states of the scattered beam .",

    "the modified model of incomplete fusion is consistent with the formation of a neutron - rich region between cold and hot fragment ( or participant zone as its precursor ) .",
    "similar effect was reported in the literature @xcite as a possible consequence of the evolution of nuclear mean field .",
    "the number of transferred neutrons can then be determined by a mechanism similar to the random neck rupture , as established in nuclear fission @xcite , which can justify the applicability of a combinatorial ( and thus essentially statistical ) probability in the description of dynamical reaction mechanism such as the incomplete fusion .",
    "a great deal of attention was paid in recent years to production of the secondary beams of exotic nuclei .",
    "one of the most promising ways to produce extremely neutron - rich nuclei around the neutron shell n=82 is fragmentation of a secondary beam of @xmath2sn .",
    "nevertheless , based on the results of the previous section , one can in principle consider also the reaction in the fermi - energy domain at energies below 50 amev .",

    "the production cross sections calculated using both the original and modified model of incomplete fusion for z=46 are comparable with results of epax and cofra , while for elements with lower atomic numbers the reaction @xmath2sn+@xmath3u leads , according to both the original and modified model of incomplete fusion , to still more favorable cross sections exceeding both cofra and even epax cross sections .",

    "[ fgsn132xs ] one can see that the trend of the shapes of mass - distributions calculated using original model of incomplete fusion is quite similar to epax ( since the assumptions are essentially similar ) while trend of the elemental yields differs due to assumed classical coulomb trajectories vs straight movement assumed in fragmentation model .",
    "the validity of epax code concerning the trend of n - rich products is a matter of discussion and based on the results of the present work one can expect that experimental production cross sections of very n - rich nuclei in fragmentation reactions will be significantly lower than the prediction of epax parametrization .",
    "the magnitude of such effect needs to be verified ( a dedicated experiment on fragmentation of @xmath2sn secondary beam is planned at gsi @xcite ) , one can nevertheless expect that the code with more realistic treatment of spectator excitation energy , such as cofra , will provide better predictions .",
