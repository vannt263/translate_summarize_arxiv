    "a surface is one of the central subjects in condensed matter physics .",
    "an open surface changes the spatial symmetry of the system and perturbs the bulk electronic states , which sometimes brings about novel surface states qualitatively different from the bulk one  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in topological insulators , the surface provides a stage where the nontrivial topological nature manifests itself , in the form of topologically protected surface states  @xcite .",
    "such topological surface states exhibit a number of interesting properties , such as a dissipationless chiral edge current , which are of special interest for device applications as well as the fundamental science .    among many systems with a topologically nontrivial character , magnetic chern insulators ( mcis )",
    "have recently attracted special interest .",
    "the mcis are magnetically ordered insulators that possess the electronic structure characterized by a nonzero chern number  @xcite .",
    "the topologically nontrivial nature usually originates in the so - called spin berry phase carried by a noncoplanar magnetic long - range order .",
    "such noncoplanar magnetic structures are often characterized by the spin scalar chirality : @xmath0 defined for three spins @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "a typical example of mcis was recently reported in the kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice near 1/4 and 3/4 fillings  @xcite .",
    "this mci is accompanied by a four - sublattice noncoplanar magnetic order with a nonzero scalar chirality , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : schematics](a ) and [ fig : schematics](b ) .",
    "the instability toward such peculiar magnetic ordering was discussed from the viewpoint of the fermi surface properties  @xcite .",
    "different types of mcis were also reported in other lattice systems  @xcite .",
    "mcis exhibit the topological quantum hall effect , associated with the nonzero chern numbers . in the quantum hall insulating state ,",
    "the surfaces become metallic and retain the chiral edge currents . however , in contrast to ordinary ( nonmagnetic ) chern insulators , the emergence of such topologically protected edge states is not trivial .",
    "this is because , in general , the magnetic structure is perturbed by the spatial symmetry breaking by the surface .",
    "once this occurs in mcis , the topological nature is also perturbed by the surface , which might significantly affect the edge states .",
    "in fact , in the previous study  @xcite , the authors found that , for the chiral edge states in the mci on the triangular lattice , the four - sublattice noncoplanar magnetic order is substantially reconstructed and ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations develop near the edges .",
    "surprisingly , the fm correlations enhance the total amount of chiral edge current up to almost twice , rather than suppress it .",
    "it is interesting how the edge magnetic reconstruction leads to the enhancement of the chiral edge current .",
    "however , the precise description of the reconstructed edge state is complicated : it is obtained only after the minimization of many - body free energy by optimizing spin configurations near the edges .",
    "it is desirable to establish an effective model , which captures the essential physics of the edge reconstruction in the mci .    in this paper , we show that the essential character of reconstructed edge states can be described by a simple junction model between the bulk four - sublattice ordered state and a fm layer .",
    "the electronic state near the interfaces in the junction system gives a good approximation to the edge states in the optimized spin configuration : the total chiral current is largely enhanced by the fm junction .",
    "furthermore , we find that the total chiral current is strongly affected by the magnetic structure of the capping layers ; for instance , it is suppressed substantially by an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) junction . through the careful analysis of electronic band structures of the edge states",
    ", we discuss the origin of the enhanced chiral edge current in terms of a variant of the double - exchange mechanism .",

    "the above consideration leads us to associate the increase of @xmath55 , or the widening of chiral  bandwidth \" , with the double - exchange mechanism  @xcite . in the double - exchange mechanism ,",
    "the underlying spins are ferromagnetically aligned so as to gain the kinetic energy of itinerant electrons .",
    "the gain of the effective kinetic energy in the edge mode for @xmath47 and @xmath30 implies that a similar mechanism works in both cases ; the fm correlation suppresses the current density in the outmost layer , but it increases the total amount of edge current by optimizing the kinetic energy in the vicinity of system edges .",
    "this double - exchange type mechanism may be generic in a wide class of mcis , and perhaps gives a guiding principle to the general problem of edge reconstruction .",
