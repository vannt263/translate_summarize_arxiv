    "the recent progress on the implementation of the kentucky noisy monte carlo algorithm to dynamical fermions is presented in sec .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "the usual approach to the finite density in the euclidean path - integral formalism of lattice qcd is to consider the grand canonical ensemble with the partition function @xmath2 e^{-s_g[u]},\\ ] ] where the fermion fields with fermion matrix @xmath3 has been integrated to give the determinant .",
    "@xmath4 is the gauge link variable and @xmath5 is the gauge action .",
    "the chemical potential is introduced to the quark action with the @xmath6 factor in the time - forward hopping term and @xmath7 in the time - backward hopping term . here",
    "@xmath8 is the lattice spacing .",
    "however , this causes the fermion action to be non - hermitian , i.e. @xmath9 . as a result , the fermion determinant @xmath10 $ ] is complex and this leads to the infamous sign problem .",
    "there are several approaches to avoid the sign problem :      it was proposed by the glasgow group  @xcite that the sign problem can be circumvented based on the expansion of the grand canonical partition function in powers of the fugacity variable @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the canonical partition function for the baryon sector with baryon number @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is calculated with reweighting of the fermion determinant @xmath16}{det m[u,0 ] } \\rangle_{\\mu = 0}.\\ ] ] since the reweighting is based on the gauge configuration with @xmath17 , it avoids the sign problem .",
    "however , this does not work , except perhaps at small @xmath18 or near the finite temperature phase transition .",
    "we will dwell on this later in sec .",
    "this is caused by the ` overlap problem '  @xcite where the important samples of configurations in the @xmath17 simulation has exponentially small overlap with those relevant for the finite density . as a result ,",

    "( [ zgc ] ) , one can in principle obtain canonical partition function @xmath13 from the fourier transform @xmath25 in this approach , one needs to integrate over the whole range of @xmath23 from @xmath26 to @xmath24 after one obtains the monte carlo configurations of @xmath27 at different @xmath23 . in practice",
    ", it is proposed to calculate the following ratio in the two - dimensional hubbard model  @xcite , @xmath28 with a reference value @xmath29 .",
    "several patches each centered around a different reference point @xmath29 are used to cover the range of @xmath23 .",
    "this was successful for the two - dimensional hubbard model with a @xmath30 lattice up to b = 6 where the determinant was calculated exactly .",
    "while this works for a small lattice in the hubbard model , it would not work for reasonably large lattices in qcd .",
    "this is because the direct calculation of the determinant is a @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 for a sparse matrix ) operation which is an impracticable task for the quark matrix which is typically of the dimension @xmath33 .",
    "any stochastic estimation of the determinant will inevitably introduce systematic error .",
    "furthermore , this will also suffer from the ` overlap ' problem discussed above .",
    "any monte carlo simulation at a reference point @xmath29 will have exponentially small overlap with those configurations important to a nonzero baryon density .      to alleviate the sign problem with the real chemical potential and the overlap problem due to reweighting , it is proposed  @xcite to do the reweighting in the multiple parameter space .",
    "the generic partition function @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ zgc ] ) is parametrized by a set of parameters @xmath34 , such as the chemical potential @xmath18 , the gauge coupling @xmath35 , the quark mass @xmath36 , etc .",
    "the partition function can be written to facilitate reweighting @xmath37 e^{-s_g[u,\\alpha_0 ] } \\{e^{-s_g[u,\\alpha ] + s_g[u,\\alpha_0 ] } \\frac{det m[u , \\alpha]}{det m[u,\\alpha_0]}\\},\\ ] ] where the monte carlo simulation is carried out with the @xmath38 set of parameters and the terms in the curly bracket are treated as observables .",
    "this is applied to study the end point in the t-@xmath18 phase diagram . in this case , the monte carlo simulation is carried out where the parameters in @xmath38 include @xmath17 and @xmath39 which corresponds to the phase transition at temperature @xmath40 . the parameter set @xmath34 in the reweighted measure include @xmath41 and an adjusted @xmath35 in the gauge action .",
    "the new @xmath35 is determined from the lee - yang zeros so that one is following the transition line in the t-@xmath18 plane and the large change in the determinant ratio in the reweighting is compensated by the change in the gauge action to ensure reasonable overlap .",
    "this is shown to work to locate the transition line from @xmath42 and @xmath43 down to the critical point on the @xmath44 and @xmath45 lattices with staggered fermions  @xcite .    while the multi - parameter reweighting is successful near the transition line , it is not clear how to extend it beyond this region , particularly the @xmath46 case where one wants to keep the @xmath35 and quark mass fixed while changing the @xmath18 .",
    "one still expects to face the overlap problem in the latter case . for large volumes , calculating the determinant ratio will be subjected to the same practical difficulty as discussed in the previous section [ icp ] .",
    "we would like to propose an algorithm to overcome the overlap problem at zero temperature which is based on the canonical ensemble approach . to avoid the overlap problem",
    ", one needs to lock in a definite nonzero baryon sector so that the exponentially large contamination from the zero - baryon sector is excluded . to see this",
    ", we first note that the fermion determinant is a superposition of multiple quark loops of all sizes and shapes .",
    "this can be easily seen from the property of the determinant @xmath47 upon a hopping expansion of @xmath48 , @xmath49 represents a sum of single loops with all sizes and shapes .",
    "the determinant is then the sum of all multiple loops .",
    "the fermion loops can be separated into two classes .",
    "one is those which do not go across the time boundary and represent virtual quark - antiquark pairs ; the other includes those which wraps around the time boundary which represent external quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the configuration with a baryon number one which entails three quark loops wrapping around the time boundary will have an energy @xmath50 higher than that with zero baryon number .",
    "thus , it is weighted with the probability @xmath51 compared with the one with no net baryons .",
    "we see from the above discussion that the fermion determinant contains a superposition of sectors of all baryon numbers , positive , negative and zero . at zero temperature where @xmath52 , the zero baryon sector dominates and all the other baryon sectors are exponentially suppressed .",
    "it is obvious that to avoid the overlap problem , one needs to select a definite nonzero baryon number sector and stay in it throughout the markov chain of updating configurations . to select a particular baryon sector from the determinant",
    "can be achieved by the following procedure  @xcite : first , assign an @xmath53 phase factor @xmath54 to the links between the time slices @xmath55 and @xmath56 so that the link @xmath57 is multiplied by @xmath58 ; then the particle number projection can be carried out through the fourier transformation of the fermion determinant like in the bcs theory @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the net particle number , i.e. particle minus antiparticle .",
    "note that all the virtual quark loops which do not reach the time boundary will have a net phase factor of unity ; only those with a net n quark loops across the time boundary will have a phase factor @xmath61 which can contribute to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) . since qcd in canonical formulation",
    "does not break @xmath62 symmetry , it is essential to take care that the ensemble is canonical with respect to triality . to this end",
    ", we shall consider the triality projection  @xcite to the zero triality sector @xmath63.\\ ] ] this amounts to limiting the quark number n to a multiple of 3 .",
    "thus the triality zero sector corresponds to baryon sectors with integral baryon numbers .",
    "another essential ingredient to circumvent the overlap problem is to stay in the chosen nonzero baryon sector so as to avoid mixing with the zero baryon sector with exponentially large weight .",
    "this can be achieved by preforming the baryon number projection as described above _ before _ the accept / reject step in the monte carlo updating of the gauge configuration .",
    "if this is not done , the accepted gauge configuration will be biased toward the zero baryon sector and it is very difficult to project out the nonzero baryon sector afterwords .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in the nuclear many - body theory where it is known  @xcite that the variation after projection ( zeh - rouhaninejad - yoccoz method  @xcite ) is superior than the variation before projection ( peierls - yoccoz method  @xcite ) .",
    "the former gives the correct nuclear mass in the case of translation and yields much improved wave functions in mildly deformed nuclei than the latter .",
    "to illustrate the overlap problem , we plot in fig.1 @xmath64 $ ] for a configuration of the @xmath65 lattice with the wilson action with @xmath66 and @xmath67 which is obtained with 500 @xmath68 noises .",
    "we see that the it is rather flat in @xmath69 indicating that the fourier transform in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) will mainly favor the zero baryon sector . on the other hand , at finite temperature",
    ", it is relatively easier for the quarks to be excited so that the zero baryon sector does not necessarily dominate other baryon sectors .",
    "another way of seeing this is that the relative weighting factor @xmath51 can be @xmath70 at finite temperature .",
    "thus , it should be easier to project out the nonzero baryon sector from the determinant .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "2 a similarly obtained @xmath64 $ ] for a configuration of the @xmath71 lattice with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we see from the figure that there is quite a bit of wiggling in this case as compared to that in fig .",
    "1 indicating that it is easier to project out a nonzero baryon sector through the fourier transform at finite temperature .    we should mention that while we think we can overcome the overlap problem and the determinant @xmath74 $ ] is real in this approach , nevertheless in view of the fact that the fourier transform in eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) involves the quark number @xmath60 the canonical approach may still have the sign problem at the thermodynamic limit when @xmath60 and @xmath75 are very large",
    ". however , we think it might work for small @xmath60 such as 3 or 6 for one or two baryons in a finite @xmath75 .",
    "this should be a reasonable start for practical purposes .    while it is clear what the algorithm in the canonical approach entails ,",
    "there are additional practical requirements for the algorithm to work .",
    "these include an unbiased estimation of the huge determinant in lattice qcd and , moreover , a monte carlo algorithm which accommodates the unbiased estimate of the probability .",
    "we shall discuss them in the following sections .",
    "there are problems in physics which involve extensive quantities such as the fermion determinant which require @xmath31 steps to compute exactly .",
    "problems of this kind with large volumes are not numerically applicable with the usual monte carlo algorithm which require an exact evaluation of the probability ratios in the accept / reject step . to address this problem , kennedy and kuti @xcite proposed a monte carlo algorithm which admits stochastically estimated transition probabilities as long as they are unbiased .",
    "but there is a drawback .",
    "the probability could lie outside the interval between @xmath26 and @xmath76 since it is estimated stochastically .",
    "this probability bound violation will destroy detailed balance and lead to systematic bias .",
    "to control the probability violation with a large noise ensemble can be costly .",
    "we propose a noisy monte carlo algorithm which avoids this difficulty with two metropolis accept / reject steps .",
    "let us consider a model with hamiltonian @xmath77 where @xmath4 collectively denotes the dynamical variables of the system .",
    "the major ingredient of the new approach is to transform the noise for the stochastic estimator into stochastic variables .",
    "the partition function of the model can be written as @xmath78\\ , e^{-h(u ) } \\nonumber \\\\     & = & \\int [ du][d\\xi]p_\\xi(\\xi)\\ , f(u,\\xi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath80 from the stochastic variable @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the probability distribution for @xmath81 .    the next step is to address the lower probability - bound violation .",

    "( [ o ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath88 as we see , the sign of @xmath79 is not a part of the probability any more but a part in the observable .",
    "notice that this reinterpretation is possible because the sign of @xmath79 is a state function which depends on the configuration of @xmath4 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear then , to avoid the problem of lower probability - bound violation , the accept / reject criterion has to be factorizable into a ratio of the new and old probabilities so that the sign of the estimated @xmath79 can be absorbed into the observable .",
    "this leads us to the metropolis accept / reject criterion which incidentally cures the problem of upper probability - bound violation at the same time .",
    "it turns out two accept / reject steps are needed in general . the first one is to propose updating of @xmath4 via some procedure while keeping the stochastic variables @xmath81 fixed .",
    "the acceptance probability @xmath89 is @xmath90 the second accept / reject step involves the refreshing of the stochastic variables @xmath81 according to the probability distribution @xmath91 while keeping @xmath4 fixed .",
    "the acceptance probability is @xmath92 it is obvious that there is neither lower nor upper probability - bound violation in either of these two metropolis accept / reject steps .",
    "furthermore , it involves the ratios of separate state functions so that the sign of the stochastically estimated probability @xmath79 can be absorbed into the observable as in eq .",

    "to find out the explicit form of @xmath79 , we note that the fermion determinant can be calculated stochastically as a random walk process  @xcite @xmath95 this can be expressed in the following integral @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the probability distribution for the stochastic variable @xmath98",

    "( [ trln ] ) . in general , for the taylor expansion @xmath107 , the series will start to converge when @xmath108 .",

    "( [ trln ] ) in order to have a convergent estimate . even then",
    ", the error bar will be very large . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", one can implement the following strategy .",
    "first , one notes that since the metropolis accept / reject involves the ratio of exponentials , one can subtract a universal number @xmath111 from the exponent @xmath112 in the taylor expansion without affecting the ratio .",
    "second , one can use a specific form of the exponential to diminish the value of the exponent .",

    "now we shall discuss a very efficient way of estimating the fermion determinant stochastically  @xcite .      the starting point for the method",
    "is the pad approximation of the logarithm function .",
    "the pad approximant to @xmath118 of order @xmath119 $ ] at @xmath120 is a rational function @xmath121 where deg  @xmath122  =  deg  @xmath123 = @xmath124 , whose value and first @xmath125 derivatives agree with @xmath126 at the specified point @xmath120 .",
    "when the pad approximant @xmath121 is expressed in partial fractions , we obtain @xmath127 whence it follows @xmath128    the pad approximation is not limited to the real axis .",
    "as long as the function is in the analytic domain , i. e. away from the cut of the log , say along the negative real axis , the pad approximation can be made arbitrarily accurate by going to a higher order @xmath119 $ ] and a judicious expansion point to cover the eigenvalue domain of the problem",
    ".      exact computation of the trace inverse for @xmath129 matrices is very time consuming for matrices of size @xmath130 .",
    "however , the complex z@xmath0 noise method has been shown to provide an efficient stochastic estimation of the trace  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been proved to be an optimal choice for the noise , producing a _ minimum _ variance  @xcite .",
    "the stochastic error of the complex z@xmath0 noise estimate results only from the off - diagonal entries of the inverse matrix ( the same is true for z@xmath138 noise for any n ) .",
    "however , other noises ( such as gaussian ) have additional errors arising from diagonal entries .",
    "this is why the z@xmath0 noise has minimum variance .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated on a @xmath139 lattice with @xmath66 and @xmath140 for the wilson action that the z@xmath0 noise standard deviation is smaller than that of the gaussian noise by a factor of 1.54  @xcite .    applying the complex z@xmath0 estimator to the expression for the @xmath141 in eq .",

    "we have adopted the m@xmath147 r algorithm , which has been shown to be about 2 times faster than the conjugate gradient algorithm , and the overhead for the multiple @xmath146 is only  8%  @xcite . the only price to pay",

    "furthermore , one observes that @xmath148 .",
    "this improves the conditioning of @xmath149 since the eigenvalues of @xmath150 have positive real parts .",
    "hence , we expect faster convergence for column inversions for eq .",
    "( [ col_inv1 ] ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe a method which significantly reduces the stochastic error .",
    "we now turn to the question of choosing suitable traceless matrices @xmath151 to use in the modified estimator .",
