    "in the past decades many improvements in the fabrication of artificial magnetic nanostructures,@xcite thin films @xcite and superlattices @xcite have been made tailoring the properties of a large class of materials exploiting advanced techniques of patterning and stress relaxation mechanisms .",
    "for instance , it has been found that the symmetry breaking at atomic steps or anisotropic lattice relaxation are at the origin of an additional in - plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy contribution in epitaxial magnetic thin films with cubic crystal symmetry , firstly observed in metal systems,@xcite and more recently in diluted semiconductors@xcite as well as oxides.@xcite the competition between the biaxial ( four - fold ) and the additional uniaxial ( two - fold ) anisotropy results in a magnetic reorientation , which depends on intrinsic parameters , such as substrate step density@xcite thickness@xcite and angle of deposition,@xcite or extrinsic ones , such as temperature range.@xcite hence , breaking the symmetry of magnetic systems results in additional contributions to the magnetic anisotropy , which could alter both magnetization , easy and hard axes and reversal processes.@xcite    in order to realize _ spintronics _ devices such as read - heads magnetic hard disks and non - volatile magnetic memories,@xcite one can exploit the interesting magneto - resistive properties of the mixed - valence manganese oxides . of particular interest is the manganite of composition la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) showing both a curie temperature above @xmath6 k and an almost full spin polarization , which can be potentially used to fabricate devices operating at room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "the ability to control and tailor the magnetic properties of the devices is hence essential .",
    "one possibility is to engineer the growth of epitaxial films in order to obtain purpose - designed magnetic anisotropy .",
    "it is well known that , in the case of ferromagnetic lsmo , the tensile or compressive strain induced by the film - substrate lattice mismatch can induce in - plane or out - of - plane easy magnetization directions , respectively.@xcite in particular , the strain in lsmo thin films deposited on srtio@xmath3 ( sto ) ( 001 ) is in - plane tensile and an in - plane biaxial magnetic anisotropy is generally observed , with the easy in - plane direction along @xmath7 , and the hard in - plane direction along @xmath8.@xcite in the case of lsmo grown onto sto(110 ) , the substrate induces a strain that is anisotropic in - plane ( i.e. , the two in - plane directions of strain are inequivalent ) .",
    "this causes an in - plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy axis ( e.a . ) of magnetization along the @xmath9 $ ] crystallographic direction.@xcite    another possibility to induce in - plane magnetic anisotropy is to create artificially periodic stepped surface by exploiting vicinal substrates.@xcite these substrates are intentionally misoriented to a ( near ) low index surface .",
    "step edges emerge and the high symmetry of the low index surface is broken , such that an additional uniaxial anisotropy is expected.@xcite matthews _",
    "et al . _ have reported an in - plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy at rt in @xmath10 nm and @xmath11 nm thick lsmo films deposited on very low miscut sto substrates ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , which vanishes at low temperatures.@xcite uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with easy axis along the step edges has been found at @xmath14k for a @xmath15 nm thick lsmo film deposited on a vicinal sto(001 ) substrate with a @xmath16 miscut off the [ 001 ] plane toward the [ 010 ] crystallographic direction.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to give a general picture on the magnetic properties , including anisotropy axis directions and magnetization reversal processes , of epitaxial lsmo thin films grown on different crystallographic directions and vicinal substrates .",
    "to do so , we first study the case of the nominally flat lsmo / sto(110 ) , in which a well defined magnetic uniaxial anisotropy is originated from the elongated structures , which could be promoted by the anisotropic strain induced by the sto(110 ) surface .",
    "we compare this system with lsmo film grown onto the nominally flat sto(001 ) surface , which shows a weak uniaxial anisotropy probably due to residual step edges on the top film surface .",
    "then , we demonstrate that exploiting stepped surfaces , i.e.  growing lsmo on vicinal sto(001 ) substrates , we can modify artificially the film morphology and its magnetic anisotropy . in general ,",
    "domain wall pinning and rotation models have been used to reproduce the angular evolution of the reversal fields , i.e. , coercivity and switching fields , near the magnetization easy axis and hard axis directions , respectively .",

    "the lsmo thin films were deposited by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) from a stoichiometric target onto commercially available sto(001 ) , sto(110 ) and vicinal sto(001 ) substrates at different thicknesses ( namely @xmath17 nm , @xmath18 nm , @xmath19 nm ) . in the latter case the vicinal angle was @xmath20 from the @xmath9 $ ] surface towards the @xmath21 $ ] crystallographic direction , thus inducing step edges along the @xmath5 $ ] direction ( see sketches in fig .",

    "[ tab_1 ] ) , we have used a simple model that considers the films like a collection of physically independent magnetic grains with magnetostatic interactions.@xcite this ansatz is required as we can exclude change of the anisotropy due to inhomogeneous strain release within our experimental resolution .",
    "the magnetic grains are approximated by cuboids of dimensions @xmath96 , where @xmath97  @xmath98 , @xmath99  nm are the measured values extracted from the afm images ( fig .  [ fig_2 ] ) and @xmath100 is assumed to be the film thickness ( tab .",
    "[ tab_1 ] ) .",
    "the gap between the cuboids has been considered as half u.c .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath101 nm . experimentally the anisotropy field presents a monotonous increase of @xmath87 with the lsmo thickness , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig_10](a ) . in fig .",

    "[ fig_10](d ) , respectively ) and for an infinite array ( blue solid line ) .",
    "it is clear that the limits of the simulation , i.e. , single grain and infinity array , are far from the measured values , but in between the model predicts an increasing of the anisotropy field with the thickness , as observed experimentally .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements proved the high crystalline quality and the epitaxy of our lsmo films , which always show a curie temperature above room temperature .",
    "scanning probe microscopies were used in order to investigate the morphology of the samples .",
    "lsmo films , with thicknesses ranging from @xmath17 nm to @xmath19 nm , show very low surface roughness ( in the unit cells range ) whereas the morphology is induced by the sto substrate .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic properties of three different systems based on epitaxial lsmo thin films by vectorial - resolved magneto optical kerr magnetometry .",
    "lsmo films deposited onto ( 110)-oriented sto surfaces show a well defined uniaxial magnetic anisotropy ascribed to the substrate induced strain . in this case",
    "the two in - plane orthogonal directions are not equivalent , and elongated structures parallel to the [ 001 ] crystallographic direction are found . in the case of the lsmo films grown onto",
    "nominally flat sto(001 ) we found a weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that we ascribed to the small miscut angle of the substrate surface .",
    "finally , lsmo films , up to @xmath19 nm thickness , grown on vicinal sto substrates , present 2-dimensional elongated structures as well , running parallel to the substrate step edge direction . in such a system , the in - plane steps along the [ 110 ] crystallographic direction , imposed by the @xmath16 vicinal cut of the sto substrate , cause a well defined uniaxial magnetic anisotropy . in this case , the easy axis for the magnetization lies parallel to the step edges , i.e. parallel to the [ 110 ] crystallographic direction , whereas the @xmath21 $ ] , perpendicular to the steps , is the hard axis for the magnetization .    for all systems investigated , we have shown the angular dependence of the magnetization reversal processes from the detailed analysis of the vectorial - resolved kerr loops .",
    "nucleation and further propagation of magnetic domains and rotation processes are the relevant mechanism during magnetization reversal for @xmath104 near the e.a .  and h.a .",
    "directions , respectively .",
    "the angular dependence of the reversal fields , both switching and coercive fields , around the e.a .  and h.a .",
    "directions has been understood in the framework of the pinning and rotation models , respectively .",
    "in addition , the latter becomes more relevant for the thinnest lsmo films .",
    "finally , we have shown that the rising of the induced anisotropy with the film thickness behavior can be reproduced qualitatively using a simple model based on magnetostatic interactions only .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the magnetic properties of lsmo epitaxial thin films , grown in different crystallographic directions and on vicinal substrates , strongly depend on the substrate induced effects .",
    "remarkable that in the case of the step - induced uniaxial anisotropy by using vicinal sto(100 ) surfaces , a well defined uniaxial anisotropy has been found for lsmo films up to 120 nm thickness .",
    "the ability to control and tailor the magnetic properties of lsmo thin films results thus to be an important task for the design of novel devices based on thin film technology .",
