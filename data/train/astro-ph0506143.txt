    "dust grains have so far been detected only in the interstellar medium and there is no firm detection in the intergalactic medium . the presence of dust grains in the latter region is still an open question . if they exist , the intergalactic dust grains should have great impacts not only on our understanding of galaxy evolution but also on our interpretation of high redshift observational data",
    ". from x - ray measurements of heavy metal lines , it is evident that there is a significant amount of metal outside of galaxies in clusters and groups of galaxies ( e.g. , mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; renzini 1997 ; davis , mulchaey & mushotzky 1999 ; buote 2000 ) .",
    "such elements are likely to have been expelled out of galaxies through supernova explosion , ram pressure stripping , or tidal interaction .",
    "dust could also be expelled by these processes or by some independent mechanism such as radiation pressure ( e.g. , chiao & wickramasinghe 1972 ; ferrara et al .",
    "1991 ; shustov & vibe 1995 ; davies et al . 1998 ; simonsen & hannestad 1999 ; aguirre et al .",
    "2001a , b )    when dust grains are placed in the intracluster medium ( hereafter icm ) , they would be heated by collisions with ambient hot x - ray emitting electrons and ions , and emit mainly in infrared bands ( dwek et al .",
    "1990 ) . at the same time",
    ", they are destructed via collisions with impinging ions ( sputtering ) with a typical timescale of @xmath3 yr . the intracluster dust ( hereafter icd ) , if any , will therefore provide a direct clue to the ejection processes of materials from galaxies .",
    "indeed , diffuse dust before destruction has been detected in a number of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. goodfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .",
    "the temperature , the amount , and the size distribution of the icd , however , can be quite different from those in the interstellar medium ; in the absence of stellar photons , temperature of the icd will be lower than that in elliptical galaxies",
    ". moreover the icd may be an important cooling agent in the icm ( montier & giard 2004 ) . revealing the nature of the icd will be of particular importance in understanding the dust - gas interaction .",
    "there have been several suggestions and debates regarding the presence of the intergalactic dust .",
    "for example , girardi et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggested that the redshift asymmetries of member galaxies in nearby groups are consistent with the presence of dust in the intragroup medium . the observed oxygen k edge in an x - ray spectrum of the perseus cluster",
    "may also be attributed to the icd ( arnaud & mushotzky 1998 ) . the extended submillimeter emission detected in a rich galaxy cluster",
    "may partly be due to dust ( komatsu et al . 1999 ; kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of enhanced visual extinction towards high redshift objects behind clusters is still controversial ( e.g. , maoz 1995 ) .",
    "more direct evidence has been searched for in the far - infrared bands .",
    "hickson et al . ( 1989 ) report that the far - infrared emission is enhanced by a factor of 2 in compact groups of galaxies compared with a sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "sulentic & de mello rabaca ( 1993 ) , however , point out that the results of hickson et al .",
    "( 1989 ) are likely to have been overestimated mainly due to the limited spatial resolution of iras .",
    "the emission statistically detected in the iras data with many clusters of galaxies may partly be due to the icd ( montier & giard 2005 ) .",
    "stickel et al .",
    "( 1998 and 2002 ) observed 6 galaxy clusters with isophot , and only in coma they reported the excess of @xmath4 mjy / sr at 120 @xmath2 m towards the central region .",
    "they estimated the dust color temperature of @xmath5 k , the excess flux of @xmath6 jy and dust mass of @xmath7 from the ratio of surface brightness at 120 @xmath2 m and 180 @xmath2 m .",
    "the visual extinction derived from the dust mass is a negligible amount ( @xmath8 mag ) .",
    "the result is in contrast to the reported optical extinction of @xmath9 mag for coma ( zwicky 1962 , karachentsev & lipovetskii 1969 ) .",
    "the major difficulties in the past infrared observations are the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of the detector .",
    "the observational data thus might be affected by galactic cirrus emission , contamination of individual galaxies , and confusion of extragalactic sources .",
    "the infrared instruments on the current and future missions , such as spitzer space telescope , astro - f , herschel , and spica , possess much improved sensitivity and spatial resolution that are essential for separating the icd emission from the other components .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of detecting the icd with spitzer space telescope , astro - f , herschel and spica by performing a comprehensive study of the expected intensities from the icd for 117 clusters of galaxies at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "based on currently available x - ray data , we explicitly take into account both heating and sputtering of dust grains via collisions with ambient hot plasma to compute their temperature and size distributions .",
    "we further examine the expected constraints from the near future observations on underlying dust model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "details of the model for the icd size distribution is presented in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] describes the results for the properties of the icd and the expected infrared spectra , as well as constraints from future observations on underlying dust model .",
    "we discuss several uncertainties in the present analysis in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "we extract 79 clusters at @xmath16 from ota & mitsuda ( 2004 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) and white ( 2000 ) for which the @xmath15-model parameters , temperature , and metalicity are all available . for some clusters , mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) fit the x - ray surface brightness by a sum of two @xmath15-model profiles . in such cases",
    ", we use the abel s integral to deproject the fitted surface brightness profile into the electron density profile ( yoshikawa & suto 1999 ) .",
    "for the three clusters ( a1689 , a2204 and pks0745 - 19 ) compiled in both ota & mitsuda ( 2004 ) and mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we use the parameters from the former paper for definiteness .",
    "we first need to specify the basic dust model to calculate the icd emission .",
    "we consider a mixture of equal amounts of spherical silicate and graphite as dust components , and adopt as their mass densities @xmath18 g @xmath19 ( draine & lee 1984 ) and @xmath20 g @xmath19 ( li & draine 2001 ) , respectively .",
    "using these two components , the extinction curve in our galaxy can be well reproduced ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 , hereafter mrn ; draine & lee 1984 ; laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "if dust grains exist in the icm , they will be heated by collision with ambient x - ray emitting hot electrons and ions , and consequently emit in infrared band as they cool .",
    "the temperature of the icd is then obtained via the balance between collisional heating and radiative cooling .    for given gas temperature and density , we determine the temperatures of dust grains following dwek ( 1986 ) taking account of both heating and cooling between each collision . the heat capacities for graphite and silicate are taken from dwek ( 1986 ) and draine & anderson ( 1985 ) , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : td_dis ] shows a specific example for the temperature distribution of graphite grains embedded in a plasma with electron temperature @xmath21 k and electron density @xmath22 @xmath19 .",
    "note that the dust temperature is not uniquely specified for given electron temperature and density , but has a probability distribution depending on the grain size . for small ( @xmath23",
    "m ) grains , the cooling time gets shorter than the interval of collisions and the dust temperature has a large dispersion ( so - called stochastic heating ) .",
    "some portion of these grains can have rather high temperatures @xmath24 k owing to their small heat capacity .",
    "larger grains , on the other hand , approach thermal equilibrium with ambient plasma and the temperature distribution has a sharp peak at @xmath25 k. as a result of stochastic heating , the spectral shape of dust emission will be broadened particularly in the wien regime .",
    "we will explicitly take into account such features in our prediction of the infrared emission from the icd .",
    "( 84mm,60mm)figure1.eps    when dust grains are placed in a hot icm , they are sputtered by impinging ions .",
    "we adopt the following analytic form for the sputtering rate ( tsai & mathews 1995 ) : @xmath26^{-1 } ,   \\label{sp_rate}\\ ] ] which gives a good approximation to the detailed calculations of draine & salpeter ( 1979 ) for both graphite and silicate grains when @xmath27 @xmath28 s@xmath29 , @xmath30 k , and @xmath31 . using this formula , we define the sputtering timescale as @xmath32 for gas temperatures above @xmath33 k",
    ", the sputtering timescale is almost independent of gas temperature and approximated by @xmath34      in modelling the size distribution of the icd , we assume that the dust grains are continuously injected into the icm from galaxies and destructed via sputtering .",
    "the size distribution @xmath35 for species @xmath36 at radial point @xmath37 then follows ( e.g. , dwek et al .",

    "<S> for 117 clusters of galaxies , we explore the detectability of intracluster dust grains by current and future infrared facilities , taking into account both collisional heating and sputtering of grains by ambient plasma . if the dust grains are injected into the intergalactic space with the amount and size comparable to the galactic values , the dust - to - gas ratio is typically @xmath0 and the mean dust temperature is @xmath1 k near the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted infrared intensities lie marginally above the detection thresholds for spitzer space telescope , astro - f , herschel and spica missions . </S>",
    "<S> for some nearby clusters such as perseus , a3571 , a2319 , a3112 and a2204 , good detections of intracluster dust signal are expected in the 70 @xmath2 m band . given rather tight constraints on the dust temperature from observed electron density and temperature , the dust mass can be inferred directly from the infrared observations . </S>",
    "<S> further constraints on the size distribution will be obtained once multi - band data are available . </S>",
    "<S> they will definitely provide a powerful probe of the dust injection processes and dust - gas interactions in the intergalactic space . </S>"
