    "<S> two - pion interferometry measurements in @xmath0@xmath1au and au@xmath1au collisions at @xmath2 gev are used to extract and compare the gaussian source radii r@xmath3 , r@xmath4 , and r@xmath5 , which characterize the space - time extent of the emission sources . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons , which are performed as a function of collision centrality and the mean transverse momentum for pion pairs , indicate strikingly similar patterns for the @xmath0@xmath1au and au@xmath1au systems . they also indicate a linear dependence of r@xmath4 on the initial transverse geometric size @xmath6 , as well as a smaller freeze - out size for the @xmath0@xmath1au system . </S>",

    "<S> thus , it is presently not clear whether the long - range ridge , observed in @xmath0@xmath1au and @xmath8@xmath1pb collisions , stems from ( i ) the final - state effects inherent in a hydrodynamical description , ( ii ) the initial - state effects driven by the correlations of gluons already present in the nucleon and nuclear wave functions or ( iii ) an interplay between these two mechanisms .    </S>",
