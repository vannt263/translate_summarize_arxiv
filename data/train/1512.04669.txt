    "human mobility in the real world and cyberspace plays an ever increasing role in the modern society and economy .",
    "many important processes are affected by the patterns of human mobility , such as epidemic and information spreading  @xcite , traffic congestion  @xcite , and e - commerce .",
    "modern research on human mobility dynamics began with the trajectory - based approach  @xcite , e.g. , by tracing the trajectories of dollar bills in the real world , which revealed a number of scaling relations such as a truncated power law in the distribution of the traveling distance .",
    "analysis of the mobile phone data demonstrated that the individual travel patterns can be characterized by a spatial probability distribution , indicating the existence of universal patterns in the human trajectories  @xcite .",
    "the question of whether human mobility patterns are predictable was addressed through an analysis of the limits of predictability in human dynamics  @xcite .",
    "more recently , human mobility in the cyberspace and its relation to that in the physical space were studied using big data analysis and phenomenological modeling  @xcite .",
    "fundamental to the study of human mobility dynamics is the development of models to reproduce the phenomena and scaling relations obtained from empirical data  @xcite .",
    "a pioneering work in this field is the articulation of a statistical , self - consistent microscopic model  @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies focused on predicting the mobility flow between two locations through , e.g. , the classic gravity model  @xcite .",
    "a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions , the so - called radiation model , was introduced  @xcite , which yields better agreement with the empirical data than the gravity model .",
    "alternative mechanisms were introduced to model the human trajectories  @xcite .",
    "the modeling effort has also been extended to the cyberspace  @xcite .",
    "while many models were developed to reproduce the scaling laws obtained from various human mobility empirical data , a physical and first - principle based understanding of the underlying dynamics is still missing . in particular , the widely studied model of human microscopic trajectories  @xcite imposes the hypothesis that the probability for individuals to visit new locations in the physical space has a power - law form : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of distinct locations already visited , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being two parameters .",
    "the underlying mechanism accounting for the power - law probability of exploring new locations is yet elusive , prompting us to wonder if there is a universal , minimal model capable of predicting all known scaling laws for human mobility in both the real world and cyberspace .    in this paper",
    ", we show that all observed statistical features of human trajectories in the physical space and cyberspace can be quantitatively predicted through a universal mechanism : memory based , preferential random walk process .",
    "the memory effect has been known to be important to human dynamics in general  @xcite , which in limited space is a basic ingredient in our minimal model .",
    "the probability for an individual to visit a new location can then be obtained from _",
    "first principle considerations _ without the need to hypothesize any particular mathematical form .",
    "the basic idea is intuitive ( as most of us have experience with ) : if an individual visited a location in the past , the location would imprint a memory effect on the individual , enhancing the probability for him / her to visit the same location in the future .",
    "the striking finding is that , this simple rule , with only a single parameter , is capable of generating all the known statistical properties of human mobility ( e.g. , those predicted by the models of self - consistency  @xcite with more parameters and scaling assumption about the probability ) . solving our minimal model analytically , we obtain scaling relations that agree well with the empirical ones from mobile phone check - ins and online shopping data sets that record human trajectories in the real world and cyberspace , respectively .",
    "our minimal model thus establishes the universal underpinning of human mobility , representing a significant step forward in understanding modern human behaviors through statistical physics .",
    "this has the potential to advance a number of disciplines such as social sciences and online economics .",
    "we consider a finite space of @xmath4 locations , in which @xmath5 individuals perform random walk with the probability of visiting a position proportional to its weight . for convenience ,",
    "we use latin and greek letters to denote individuals and locations , respectively .",
    "the weight of a location @xmath6 with respect to individual @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is updated during the process .",
    "an actual visit of @xmath7 to @xmath6 will increase the weight @xmath8 through @xmath9 - the memory factor parameter . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the random walk is unbiased and memory - preferential , respectively .",
    "is denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "the probability for the walker to choose location @xmath13 is propositional to the initial weight of this location plus the product of the memory factor parameter @xmath9 and @xmath12 . ]    in our memory - preferential random walk ( mprw ) model , for individual @xmath7 the weight sequence of all @xmath4 locations at time step @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of times that position @xmath6 has been visited before time @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath7 is about to move to a new location at @xmath17 , the probability to go to @xmath6 is proportional to the weight of @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",

    "the three statistical quantities  @xcite characterizing the human mobility dynamics are : ( _ i _ ) the total number @xmath20 of distinct locations that an individual visited within time @xmath14 , ( _ ii _ ) the probability @xmath21 for an individual to visit the @xmath22th new location , if he / she has already visited @xmath23 distinct locations , and ( _ iii _ ) the fraction @xmath24 of locations that have been visited @xmath25 times .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 can be used to infer whether previously visited locations are more likely to be visited than newly discovered locations , which we will show possesses a more complex form than the well - known zipf s law  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : comparison](b ) shows the behavior @xmath21 , where we see that the memory effect in general decreases the value @xmath22 at which @xmath21 begins to decrease rapidly , meaning that nostalgic individuals tend to discover few locations , a behavior that is consistent with that in fig .",

    "the scaling exponent is about @xmath49 .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath9 , @xmath24 apparently deviates from the theoretically predicted power - law form .",

    "a key to validating the model is the choice of some suitable value of the memory factor , @xmath9 .",

    "from fig .",
    "[ fig : real_data](b ) , we note that the @xmath21 curve from the model has a shorter tail than that from the real data .",
    "this is due to the difference in the time scale between the simulation and real data , e.g. , @xmath52 in the real data may correspond to a much longer time duration in the model .",

    "this process can be regarded as users surfing online web pages , i.e. , movements in the cyberspace .",
    "our data set consists of the records of 34330 individuals .",
    "after initial filtering to remove the individuals with abnormally long or very short click strings , we obtain a slightly smaller data set with 33462 users , for which the total number of web pages is @xmath61 .    to cast the online - shopping process in the framework of mprw , we regard each web page as a location . to be consistent with the data , we set @xmath37 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . using the same method as for the mobile phone data , we determine the optimal value of the memory - factor parameter to be @xmath64 .",
    "the results of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath24 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : real_data](d - f ) , respectively .",
    "again , the results from mprw model agree well with those from the data [ for @xmath21 a good agreement is achieved when an extended time duration , @xmath65 , is used in the model , as shown in the inset in ( b ) ] , suggesting the model s universal applicability .",
    "to summarize , we develop a random walk model with a single parameter to reproduce the statistical scaling behaviors of the three quantities characterizing human mobility . the key element that makes our model distinct from previous ones",
    "is a memory - preferential mechanism in limited space .",
    "we demonstrate that , when this mechanism is incorporated into a standard random walk process , the analytically predicted behaviors agree , at a detailed and quantitative level , with those from two representative real data sets , one for real world and another for cyberspace movements .",
    "this is remarkable , considering that model is minimal with only a single adjustable parameter , the memory - factor parameter .",
    "the main message is then that , while various mechanisms can be considered for human mobility , such as planted or social events  @xcite and gender difference  @xcite , our findings provide strong evidence that random walk with memory is the universal underpinning of the human movement dynamics .",
    "while we assume in the present work that the walkers are homogeneous , the analysis can be extended to models incorporating memory heterogeneity .",
    "given a data set from any generic behavior of human movements , the optimal memory - factor parameter for the mprw model can be estimated by comparing the behavior of an elementary statistical quantity from data and model .",
    "this feature has the additional benefit of assessing and quantifying the degree of intrinsic memory effect in the real system , which has potential applications to problems of significant current interest such as traffic optimization and online recommendation .",
