    "in recent years , a nondegenerate three - level laser has attracted a great deal of interest in relation to its potential as a reliable source of robust entangled light @xcite .",
    "the nonclassical features of the radiation are predominantely attributed to the atomic coherence induced by initially preparing the atoms in a coherent superposition of the energy levels between which a direct spontaneous transition is electric dipole forbidden @xcite or by pumping the same with an external radiation @xcite . however , due to the fragility of the coherent superposition , the pertinent continuous variable entanglement is believed to be significantly ruined by various phenomena closely associated with the lasing process ; noteworthy among many are dephasing and phase fluctuations . in practical situations ,",
    "it is not possible to prepare the coherent superposition with an arbitrary perfection due to instability of the laser , faulty setups , and the inefficiency of the devices employed @xcite .",
    "even , in case one manages to prepare the coherent superposition somehow , it will subsequently decay due to the interaction with the surrounding @xcite .",
    "therefore , a study of the effects of the phase fluctuations and dephasing on the evolution of the entanglement generation appears to be of a paramount importance .",
    "over the years , the issue of phase fluctuations has attracted a considerable attention @xcite . in these studies",
    "the phase and photon number operators are presumed to fulfill a canonical commutation relation . in a more recent times , assuming the phase as randomly fluctuating @xmath0-number parameter , it is shown that the phase fluctuations substantially decrease the degree of entanglement @xcite .",
    "investigation of a similar nature where the coherence is assumed to be partially prepared is also considered @xcite . in the present contribution , in order to investigate the effects of the phase fluctuations and dephasing on the time evolution of the generated entanglement in depth , coherently pumped correlated emission laser turns out to be a convenient tool ( detailed description of the physical model can be found , for instance , in @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the three - level atoms are taken to be prepared initially in a partial 50:50 probability to be in the upper and lower energy levels .",
    "the atoms prepared in this manner are injected into the cavity at a constant rate and externally driven with a resonant coherent radiation while traversing the cavity .",
    "it is not difficult to envision that the pumping radiation could have also led to phase fluctuations ; whose effect was thoroughly addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "moreover , taking the recent advance in locking a phase in such a system into consideration , the rate at which the coherence superposition decays is set to be less than the spontaneous atomic decay rate .    in the midest of the efforts geared towards understanding how to create , manipulate , explain and relate entanglement with various nonclassical correlations ,",
    "it becomes evident that the degree of detectable entanglement when different criteria are used is found to be different .",
    "the emerging disparity can be fundamentally linked to the difference in the physical contexts and assumptions involved in deriving the correlations @xcite . in view of this , over the years , quite a large volume of work aimed at quantifying the degree of available entanglement has appeared @xcite .",
    "essentially , the proposed criteria are in the form of some sort of inequality , in most instances provide only sufficient conditions and on top of that practical realization is mostly intractable due to the involved impairment in the corresponding measurement strategies .",
    "therefore , it would be imperative studying the nature of entanglement applying different criteria with the intention of looking for the overlap so that the likelihood of the prediction and realizeability becomes more reliable @xcite . with this conviction ,",
    "the time evolution of the entanglement is studied applying the criteria usually dubbed as logarithmic negativity @xcite , duan - giedke - cirac - zoller ( dgcz ) @xcite and hillery - zubairy ( hz ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are compared whenever possible .    in the study of the time evolution of a similar system when many parameters are involved",
    ", the usual approach is numerically calculating the required correlations making use of either the characteristic function @xcite or the rate equation @xcite .",
    "however , in this article , the dynamics of the cavity radiation is analyzed following a straightforward analytic procedure recently outlined elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the resulting analytical solutions were successfully employed earlier in the study of the time evolution of the two - mode squeezing and intensity @xcite .",
    "particularly , the time evolution of the two - mode squeezing shows that the phase fluctuation inherent with the imperfect preparation can enhance nonclassical features when the atoms are driven with a strong external radiation by creating spontaneous emission transition root via weakening the otherwise induced strong coupling of the upper and lower energy levels by pumping .",
    "however , in this contribution , it is shown that the degree of entanglement exhibits damping oscillatory nature when there is no driving radiation where in between there is a narrow window of time in which the degree of entanglement is found to increase with the deviation of the phase fluctuation and rate of dephasing .",
    "the fluctuation of the degree of entanglement is solely attributed to the choice of the values of these parameters which are not completely independent .",
    "the interaction of a pumped nondegenerate three - level cascade atom with a resonant two - mode cavity radiation can be described in the rotating - wave approximation and the interaction picture by the hamiltonian of the form @xmath1\\notag\\\\ & + i{\\omega\\over2}[|c\\rangle\\langle a|-|a\\rangle\\langle c|],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a real - positive constant proportional to the amplitude of the driving radiation and @xmath3 is a coupling constant chosen to be the same for both transitions . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the annihilation operators that represent the two cavity modes . in the cascade configuration ,",
    "the transition from upper energy level @xmath6 to the intermediate level @xmath7 and from level @xmath7 to the lower energy level @xmath8 are taken to be resonant with the cavity radiation , whereas the transition @xmath9 is electric dipole forbidden .",
    "moreover , as a result of the emerging various quantum effects , it is assumed that the atoms can only be initially prepared in a partial maximum coherent superposition of the upper and lower energy levels ( a more general case has been presented in @xcite ) .    on account of this",

    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the degree of entanglement exhibits damping oscillatory nature for certain parameters under consideration .",
    "it is worth noting that , since the injection of the atoms is launched at @xmath91 , entanglement would not be expected at the beginning when the cavity is taken to be initially at vacuum state .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to see that the degree of entanglement increases rapidly and then starts to fluctuate with time .",
    "the increment of the degree of entanglement at early stages of the lasing process can be directly linked to the increment of the atoms that participate in the correlated emission . similar increment behavior at early stages of lasing operation was observed for various schemes of three - level laser under different conditions using various entanglement criteria @xcite .",

    "one can hence deduce that the main source of this oscillatory nature is the competition between the rate at which the coherent superposition decays and the degree at which the same coherence exhibits fluctuations initially .",
    "quite obviously , this competition can be directly associated with the mean photon number of the generated radiation .",
    "although it is not presented in this work , the pertinent mean photon number also exhibits a similar kind of oscillatory nature . therefore",
    ", comparison between the two reveals that the degree of entanglement and the mean photon number are larger for the same parameters .",
    "it is hence anticipated that the thermal fluctuations arising due to high intensity might be responsible for the downturn of the quantum features ( increment of @xmath45 ) @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting at this juncture that in the definition of the covariance matrix , terms related to normal ordering are included that are basically associated with the contribution of vacuum fluctuations which might have played a significant role .",
    "it is not hard to notice from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the smallest eigenvalue corresponding to the covariance matrix is smaller for smaller values of @xmath86 at early stages of the lasing process .",
    "this indicates that the degree of entanglement by large decreases with the increasing rate at which the coherence superposition decays provided that the rate at which the atoms spontaneously decay is taken to be constant .",

    "on the other hand , critical scrutiny of figs [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] reveals that the time at which the degree of entanglement becomes maximum increases with the rate of dephasing .",
    "though increasing the rate of dephasing significantly damages the generated entanglement , it can be utilized in prolonging the time at which the maximum entanglement can be generated .",
    "this can be taken as a positive aspect in practical realization of entanglement in such a system where the corresponding actual time is very small .    in plotting fig .",

    "based on the assumption that various processes affect the preparation of the coherent superpositions and subsequent dynamics , the degree by which the phase fluctuates and the rate at which the coherence decays are taken as the probing mechanism .",

    "this is mainly because , the strong external driving radiation induces additional coherence while the atoms traverse the cavity which subsequently compensates for the effect of dephasing and phase fluctuations .",

    "moreover , the oscillatory nature of the nonclassical features and photon statistics disappears for longer time span , since the steady state effects start to dominate .",
    "critical scrutiny reveals that physically valid result can be obtained by carefull selection of these parameters .",
    "this can be related to the fact that when entirely viewed from physical perspective , the rate of dephasing and the phase fluctuation can not be set arbitrarily since these physical processes are not entirely independent .",
    "this is mainly because , setting @xmath86 small principally implies that the rate at which the coherent superposition decays is small .",
    "this , in other words , means that the phase between the upper and lower energy levels is locked by some degree .",
    "this does not arbitrarily go with the assumption that the phase fluctuates vigorously ( large phase fluctuations ) .",
    "what possibly can be done in practical utilization of the system is adjusting the two parameters in such away that one assumption does not preclude the effect of the other .",
    "comparison among the prediction of the nature of the evolution of the entanglement by various criteria more or less indicates the same thing . at this juncture",
    ", it would be appropriate citing the disparity between the prediction following from the criteria of logarithmic negativity and dgcz for large @xmath2 at longer time scale . by and large",
    ", this study evinces that the system under consideration can be a source of strongly entangled light for wide selection of parameters . even though detailed analysis at steady",
    "state is still lacking , it is possible to infer that at longer time scale , externally driving the cavity significantly improves the degree of nonclassical features of the generated radiation .",

    "<S> a detailed study of the effects of phase fluctuation and dephasing on the dynamics of the entanglement generated from a coherently pumped correlated emission laser is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the time evolution of the entanglement is significantly reliant on the phase fluctuation and dephasing , particularly , at early stages of the lasing process . in the absence of external driving radiation , </S>",
    "<S> the degree of entanglement and intensity turns out to attain a maximum value just before starting to exhibit oscillation which dies at longer time scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , in case the driving mechanism is on , the oscillatory nature disappears due to the additional induced coherent superposition and the degree of entanglement would be larger at steady state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the degree of entanglement as predicted by the logarithmic negativity and the duan - giedke - cirac - zoller criteria exhibits a similar nature when there is no driving radiation , although such a trend is eroded with increasing strength of the pumping radiation at longer time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the other important aspect of the phase fluctuation and dephasing is the possibility of relaxing the time at which the maximum entanglement is detected . </S>"
