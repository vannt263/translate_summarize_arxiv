    "as is well known , the experimentally measured shape anisotropy field for nanowires can be expressed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the demagnetization factor and @xmath12 is the saturation magnetization . in our case , however , the experimentally measured effective anisotropy field , @xmath20 , should be different since the nanofibers are randomly aligned within the sample plane . in order to calculate @xmath20 , we first deduce the effective demagnetization factor for a disk - like sample composed of randomly aligned nanofibers .",

    "then , the effective anisotropy field is expressed as @xmath29 using the measured @xmath12=58.4emug@xmath13 , we can calculate the effective anisotropy field to be @xmath20=1006oe .",
    "this value is much larger than the measured value from the hysteresis loops , @xmath30600oe , which is deduced as twice of the shaded area @xcite indicated in the lower inset of fig .",
    "this suggests that the effective anisotropy is rather different from that expected for nanowires that are dominated by the shape anisotropy . in other words , if we consider one single nanofiber , the easy magnetization direction is not along the long axis of the fiber , which is evidenced by our mssbauer measurements .",

    "clearly , the spectrum evolves from two sextets ( corresponding to the fe atoms sit at tetrahedral ( a ) sites and octahedral ( b ) sites , respectively ) for x=0 to a quadrupole split doublet for x=0.6 , indicating the collapse of the long range magnetic order upon zn substitution , coincidence with magnetization measurements @xcite . from the shape of the spectra",

    "as is well known , the direction of the magnetic moments can be deduced by the relative intensities of the six absorption lines of the zeeman split sextet .",
    "the relative intensities as a function of the polar angle @xmath21 between the magnetic moment and the incident @xmath7-rays is expressed as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the line intensities of the 2,5th and 1,6th peaks of the magnetic splitting sextet , respectively .",
    "the best fit of our mssbauer spectra for cufe@xmath2o@xmath3 yields @xmath37 , which is close to the value of 2 for samples with randomly aligned magnetic moments .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the usual expected value of 4 for nanowires where the magnetic moments usually aligns parallel to the long axis of the nanowires due to the shape anisotropy .",
    "this result explains well why the measured effective anisotropy is much smaller than expected .",

    "according to herzer s statement @xcite , when the grain size ( @xmath38 ) along with the intergranular distance ( @xmath39 ) is smaller than the exchange length ( @xmath40 ) , the exchange coupling takes place .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy will be suppressed by the exchange coupling , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant and @xmath43 is the granular amount within the volume of @xmath44",
    ". this will effectively increase the demagnetization effect , which favors that the magnetization align parallel to the long axis of the nanowires .",
    "if we adopt the value of @xmath45jm@xmath13 @xcite , the estimated exchange length is @xmath4633.8 nm . in the present nanofibers ,",
    "as learned from tem results , the size of the small grains ( @xmath550 nm ) exceeds this characteristic length .",
    "thus , dipolar interaction should be expected in the present cu@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 nanofibers , which means that the magnetization in two neighboring grains favor an antiparallel alignment .    to prove our above arguments",
    ", we further study the magnetic interactions of the small grains inside the nanofibers .",
    "a useful tool for studying the interactions among magnetic nanograins is the henkel plot or the @xmath47 plot @xcite .",
    "it is well known , for an assembly of magnetically noninteracting nanograins , that the isothermal remanent magnetization @xmath48 and the dc demagnetization remanence @xmath49 should obey the stoner - wohlfarth relation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the maximum remanent magnetization measured after saturation .",
    "henkel first proposed that the deviation of the measured @xmath49 and @xmath52 can be used to study the magnetic interactions in real systems .",
    "the henkel plot is expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath53 positive values of @xmath47 are due to exchange interactions promoting the magnetized state , while negative values of @xmath47 correspond to dipolar interactions tending to assist magnetization reversal .",
    "@xmath47 plot of the cufe@xmath2o@xmath3 nanofibers.,width=8 ]    typical room temperature @xmath47 plot for cufe@xmath2o@xmath3 nanofibers is shown in fig .",
    "[ deltam ] . as can be seen , two minimum values of the @xmath47 curve that possibly due to inter - fiber and inter - grain interactions are observed @xcite .",
    "negative values of @xmath47 are indicative of a dipolar type of interaction , which is expected in the case of loosely connected nanograins .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the present nanofibers are composed of dipolar coupled nanograins and the interaction between these nanofibers is also dipolar type , which tend to assist the magnetization reversal process hence reduce the effective shape anisotropy and lead to the above observed unusual magnetic anisotropy effect .",
    "in summary , we have studied the microstructure and magnetic anisotropy effect of electrospun cu@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 nanofibers .",
    "magnetic and mssbauer measurements reveal that the electrospun nanofibers have a rather isotropic magnetic anisotropy .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the usual sense for nanowires that prepared by conventional methods . from the negative values of the @xmath47 plot as well as the tem results",
    ", we can conclude that the present nanofibers are composed of randomly aligned and dipolar coupled nanograins and these nanofibers are also dipolar coupled , which reduces the effective shape anisotropy and well explains the observed unusual magnetic anisotropy effect .",
