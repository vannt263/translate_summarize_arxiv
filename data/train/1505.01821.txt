    "since the discovery in 1998 that the universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion @xcite , considerable work has been done trying to understand what it is driving the phenomenon .",
    "the standard explanation beyond a simple cosmological constant relies on introducing a new cosmic fluid , dubbed dark energy , which possesses negative pressure in order to accelerate the expansion .",
    "dark energy is parametrised via an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is its pressure , @xmath2 is its energy density and @xmath3 stands for a possible dependence of the equation of state with the redshift @xmath4 .",
    "the standard case is given by @xmath5 , which represents the cosmological constant @xmath6 , where together with cold dark matter ( cdm ) form the cosmic concordance model @xmath6cdm .",
    "extensive observational efforts have been carried out in order to falsify @xmath5 through several observables , as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) . as there is no compelling model to explain the acceleration , it is often simplest to use simple parameterisations for @xmath7 , where a dependence with the redshift can be accommodated by adding a new parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "an interesting and independent way to test for deviations of the @xmath6cdm model is to use non - parametric methods , which are suitable for describing how @xmath3 evolves not restricted by simple parametric models .",
    "examples considered in the literature include the principal component analysis method ( pcas ) @xcite , gaussian processes ( gps ) @xcite and local regression smoothing @xcite .",
    "reconstructions have been limited by degeneracies involving the matter density parameter @xmath8 and the curvature density parameter @xmath9 . from one side ,",
    "@xmath9 can be inferred due its geometrical structure @xcite , whereas for @xmath8 there is a so - called dark degeneracy @xcite whereby dark energy and dark matter are hard to separate .    here",
    "we show that there is a simple function of @xmath3 and its first derivative which is completely independent of @xmath8 .",
    "this function can be used to look for a time evolution of the dark energy equation of state without any dark matter degeneracy .",
    "we use data from snia and @xmath10 measurements from cosmic chronometers and baos to constrain this new function , along with the evolution of @xmath7 .",
    "we compare parametric reconstructions to a gp reconstruction and show that gps provide much stronger constraints than parameterisations at low redshifts and are broadly consistent with @xmath6cdm .",
    "the dimensionless comoving distance @xmath11 can be written as a function of the luminosity distance @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble constant .",
    "the effective dark energy equation of state is @xmath15 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the redshift . throughout the paper we assume @xmath16 , although we note a degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath9 can be important at high redshifts @xcite . given distance - redshift data , we can determine @xmath7 from this relation .",
    "however , the value of @xmath8 must be provided _ a priori _ from independent methods in order to test for deviations of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can write the effective adiabatic sound speed for dark energy as @xmath18}\\ , .          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combining with @xmath3 we define @xmath19}{d'\\left[2(1+z)d '' + 3d'\\right]}.\\nonumber     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath20 is completely independent of @xmath8 and is a function of the observable quantity @xmath21 and its derivatives .",
    "model - independent constraints on @xmath22   and consequently @xmath7   can be derived through non - parametric methods .",
    "any deviation from @xmath23 would rule out the flat @xmath6cdm model , and so forms a useful null test of concordance cosmology  @xcite ( see @xcite for another null test independent of @xmath8 ) .",
    "another way to think of the function @xmath22 is to say that in the possible function space of @xmath3 , @xmath22 selects the subspace which is independent of @xmath8 , while giving a measure of the first derivative of @xmath7",
    ".      we shall now constrain @xmath22 in 2 different ways .",
    "given sne ia and @xmath10 data , we need to find @xmath11 and its first 3 derivatives .",
    "first we will use gaussian processes ( gps ) which are a robust smoothing technique which allows for differentiation of data   this technique is summarized in the appendix .",
    "we will use the third line in eq .",
    "[ eqf ] to obtain constraints on @xmath22 and eq .",
    "[ djskbcskcb ] with a suitable prior on @xmath8 to derive constraints for @xmath7",
    ". then we will compare these results with two parametric models .",
    "we choose a standard one and a new one which produces similar constraints on @xmath7 but rather different constraints on the evolution .    * a standard series expansion in @xmath24 : @xmath25 , generally called the cpl ( chevalier - polarski - linder ) parameterisation @xcite . *",
    "constant @xmath22 : @xmath26 .",
    "this model is constructed such that @xmath27 is constant .",
    "note that @xmath28 gives @xmath23 , which means that although @xmath29 rules out flat @xmath6cdm , @xmath23 is also compatible with different models .",
    "although the second of these may look rather unusual , these are actually rather similar in terms of their basic assumptions because the cpl parameterisation is constructed so that @xmath30 is constant .      for both the non - parametric and parametric analyses we use 580 luminosity distance measurements from sne ia @xcite , where we included all the systematic errors , and 26 @xmath10 measurements from cosmic chronometers @xcite and baos @xcite . for the hubble constant",
    "we adopt @xmath31 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 @xcite , which is in agreement with the revisited local value based on the ngc 4258 maser distance obtained by efstathiou @xcite : @xmath33 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 .",
    "as we assume spatial flatness ( @xmath16 ) , the @xmath10 measurements can be directly used to obtain the first derivative of @xmath21 : @xmath34 , which allows us to incorporate the derivative of @xmath21 as data in our gps analysis .    for the parametric analyses , we obtain the posterior probabilities ( see e.g. @xcite ) using emcee @xcite , an affine - invariant ensemble sampler for markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite . for example , in the cpl case we use the posteriors of @xmath35 to derive constraints to @xmath3 sampling from these parameters , the same for @xmath22 using the second line of eq .",
    "[ eqf ] .",
    "an important issue in our analysis is that distance moduli of sne ia were used already fitted for some nuisance parameters in a given cosmological model @xcite .",
    "therefore , a more model - independent procedure would be to introduce these nuisance parameters in our gp regression .",
    "on the other hand , such approximation was also taken in our parametric analyses , which makes a comparison between them consistent .",
    "+              +         in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show constraints on @xmath3 , and @xmath20 for the different methods .",
    "the parametrised models show broadly similar behaviour for the constraints on @xmath3 and give similar errors compared to those found using gps , at least for low to moderate @xmath4 ( strong constraints at high @xmath4 only come from the choice of parameterisation ) . in this case , the good constraints with gps are obtained because of the prior adopted on @xmath8 , where much weaker ones would be derived considering a broad flat prior on @xmath8   this arises simply from  .",
    "for @xmath20 the situation is rather different , with very different constraints found for the different approaches .",
    "constraints at all redshifts between parametrised models versus gps are very different . with gps @xmath20",
    "is well constrained at small redshifts @xmath36 and weakly constrained for redshifts above that .",
    "also it is interesting to point out that for gps the constraints on @xmath20 are weakly dependent on the @xmath10 data , where they are slightly enlarged if we do not use this sample . in redshift regions well sampled by data good constraints are derived , while redshift regions sparsely measured are not able to distinguish between different values for @xmath22 , when combined with the fact that changes in @xmath7 affect @xmath7 at low @xmath4 most strongly .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the results from the parametric methods , which provide better results at high redshifts due to the imposed shape of the function a priori .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the posteriors at @xmath37 for all the different cases . with no prior on @xmath8",
    "only @xmath22 found by gps has strong constraints , while individual constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath38 are significantly weaker . with a prior on @xmath8 ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 vary significantly .",
    "in particular , the parametric approaches favour both @xmath7 and @xmath38 in different ways ( cpl favours @xmath7 nearer 0 and @xmath38 more negative , and the constant @xmath22 model pulls in the opposite directions ) , while gps give tight constraints approaching the union of the parameterised models .",
    "it is important to stress one needs to be careful of not deriving biased results due to a given value for @xmath8 .",
    "for example , there is a tension for @xmath40 when using gps and our ( somewhat arbitrary ) choice of prior on @xmath8 which completely disappears when using _",
    "values @xcite for @xmath8 and @xmath14 : @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath10 data prefer lower values of @xmath14 as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , gp reconstructed @xmath22 gives strong constraints favouring a @xmath6cdm model , with @xmath22 providing an unbiased , more powerful tool to look for deviations of the concordance model as a time - varying dark energy .      in order to analyse the robustness of our method",
    ", we performed 1000 simulations of sne ia data in a @xmath6cdm model with @xmath44 , @xmath45 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 and the same redshift distribution of the union2.1 sample . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we restricted ourselves only to sne ia data and we show the results for @xmath20 with an emphasis on @xmath41 .",
    "fig [ fig3 ] presents the average posterior for @xmath22 given the 1000 simulations , where the left panel has the result for @xmath41 and the right panel the result for @xmath20 for all redshifts .",
    "as we can see , the width of the curve is consistent with the errors obtained , and there is a small bias much smaller than the errors .",
    "we also have checked that the results are not influenced by the fiducial cosmological model , since changing for xcdm or a time - varying equation of state for dark energy gave consistent results , as it is shown in fig .",
    "4 . bigger samples as the ones coming from the ongoing dark energy survey will demand a thorough scrutiny of the bias , although it can be safely neglected for the current size of sne ia samples .",
    "we have shown that for a flat model there exists a combination of @xmath7 and its first derivative @xmath38 which can be found purely from hubble normalised distance data independently of @xmath8 .",
    "this provides a route by which we can place constraints on the time evolution of @xmath7 without requiring a prior on @xmath8 . at @xmath37",
    "this corresponds to roughly the lines in the @xmath35 plane where @xmath46const .",
    "we have shown that using gps strong constraints can be placed on @xmath41 using current data , and with no assumptions on @xmath8 or @xmath3 .",
    "this is to be seen in stark contrast to parametric models which have significantly weaker constraints , but an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the constraints on @xmath22 are similarly much stronger than constraints on either @xmath7 or @xmath38 at the origin .",
    "consequently , using @xmath22 as a complimentary function to @xmath3 might be a more useful way to characterize the time evolution of @xmath7 than is currently done .",
    "of course , if one wants @xmath3 explicitly the degeneracy with @xmath8 is unavoidable . in this sense",
    ", have we really dodged the degeneracy ? we have presented a new perspective on the question : since @xmath3 is usually a placeholder for whatever is ` not-@xmath6 ' , it may well be a sub - optimal measure of ` not-@xmath6 ' .",
