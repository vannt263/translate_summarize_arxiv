    "internal gravity waves play a primary role in geophysical fluids  @xcite : they contribute significantly to mixing in the ocean @xcite and they redistribute energy and momentum in the middle atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "the generation and propagation mechanisms are fairly well understood , as for instance in the case of oceanic tidal flows @xcite . by contrast , the dissipation mechanisms , together with the understanding of observed energy spectra resulting from nonlinear interactions between those waves , are still debated @xcite .",
    "several routes towards dissipation have been identified , from wave - mean flow interactions to cascade processes , but this remains a fairly open subject from both theoretical  @xcite and experimental points of view  @xcite .",
    "the objective of this review is to present important recent progress that sheds new light on the nonlinear destabilization of internal wave beams , bridging part of the gap between our understanding of their generation mechanisms based mostly on linear analysis , and their subsequent evolution through nonlinear effects .    until recently",
    ", most studies were focused on plane wave solutions , which are introduced in classical textbooks  @xcite .",
    "strikingly , such plane waves are not only solutions of the linearized dynamics , but also of the nonlinear equations @xcite . however , spatially and temporally monochromatic internal wave trains are not a satisfactory description of most geophysical internal gravity waves  @xcite .",
    "indeed , oceanic field observations have rather reported internal gravity beams with a confined profile @xcite . in the atmosphere , gravity waves due to thunderstorms also often form beam - like structures @xcite .",
    "oceanic wave beams arise from the interaction of the barotropic tide with sea - floor topography , as has been recently studied theoretically and numerically @xcite , taking into account transient , finite - depth and nonlinear effects , ignored in the earlier seminal work by @xcite .",
    "the importance of those beams has also been emphasized recently in quantitative laboratory experiments  @xcite . from these different works",
    ", it is now recognized that internal wave beams are ubiquitous in the geophysical context .",
    "the interest for internal gravity beams resonates with the usual pedagogical introduction to internal waves , the saint andrew s cross , which comprises four beams generated by oscillating a cylinder in a stratified fluid  @xcite .",
    "thorough studies of internal wave beams can be found in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite have realized that an inviscid uniformly stratified boussinesq fluid supports time - harmonic plane waves invariant in one transverse horizontal direction , propagating along a direction determined by the frequency ( and the medium through the buoyancy frequency ) , with a general spatial profile in the cross - beam direction .",
    "these wave beams are not only fundamental to the linearized dynamics but , like sinusoidal wavetrains , happen to be exact solutions of the nonlinear governing equations .",
    "remarkably , @xcite showed that the steady - state similarity linear solution for a viscous beam @xcite is also valid in the nonlinear regime . in light of the recent experimental and analytical studies of those internal gravity wave beams ,",
    "it is thus timely to study their stability properties .",
    "the structure of the review is the following .",
    "first , in section  [ sectionintroductive ] , we introduce the subject by presenting concepts , governing equations and approximations that lead to the description of gravity waves in stratified fluids .",
    "we dedicate a special emphasis on the peculiar role of nonlinearities to explain why internal gravity wave beams are ubiquitous solutions in oceans and middle atmospheres .",
    "then , in section  [ triadicresonanceinstability ] , we discuss the classic triadic resonant instability that corresponds to the destabilization of a primary wave with the spontaneous emission of two secondary waves , of lower frequencies and different wave vectors . in addition to the simple case of plane waves , we discuss in detail the generalization to wave beams with a finite width .",
    "section  [ streaminginstability ] is dedicated to the streaming instability , the second important mechanism for the instability of internal gravity waves beams through the generation of a mean flow .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusionsperspectives ] , we draw some conclusions and discuss main future issues .",
    "let us consider an incompressible non rotating stratified boussinesq fluid in cartesian coordinates ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 ) where @xmath2 is the direction opposite to gravity .",
    "the boussinesq approximation amounts to neglecting density variations with respect to a constant reference density @xmath3 , except when those variations are associated with the gravity term @xmath4 .",
    "the relevant field to describe the effect of density variations is then the buoyancy field @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the full density field , = ( @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9 ) the space coordinates and @xmath10 the time coordinate .",
    "let us call @xmath11 the density of the flow at rest , with buoyancy frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding buoyancy profile @xmath13 is denoted @xmath14 .",
    "the buoyancy frequency @xmath15 varies in principle with the depth  @xmath9 . in the ocean",
    ", @xmath15 is rather large in the thermocline and weaker in the abyss . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "however , @xmath15 will be taken constant in the remainder of the paper . in some studies , to ease greatly the theoretical analysis , this approximation that looks drastic at first sight can be relaxed when @xmath15 changes smoothly by relying on the wkb approximation .",
    "the equations of motion can be written as a dynamical system for the perturbed buoyancy field @xmath16 and the three components of the velocity field = ( @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 ) : @xmath20 with @xmath21 the pressure variation with respect to the hydrostatic equilibrium pressure @xmath22 , and @xmath23 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "we have neglected the molecular diffusivity , which would imply a term @xmath24 in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : cons_masse ] ) , with @xmath25 the diffusion coefficient of the stratifying element ( molecular diffusivity for salt , thermal diffusivity for temperature ) .",
    "the importance of the dissipative terms with respect to the nonlinear ones are described by the reynolds @xmath26 and the peclet numbers @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 typical velocity and length scales , or equivalently by the reynolds number and the schmidt number @xmath30 . in many geophysical situations , both reynolds and peclet numbers",
    "are large , and molecular effects can be neglected at lowest order . in such cases ,",
    "the results do not depend on the schmidt number . in laboratory settings ,",
    "the peclet is often also very large , at least when the stratification agent is salt , in which case @xmath31 m@xmath32s@xmath33 .",
    "however , the viscosity of water is @xmath34 m@xmath32s@xmath33 , and the corresponding reynolds numbers are such that viscous effects can play an important role , as we will see later .",
    "let us first consider the simplest case of two - dimensional flow , which is invariant in the transverse @xmath8-direction .",
    "the non - divergent two - dimensional velocity field is then conveniently expressed in terms of a streamfunction @xmath35 as @xmath36 . introducing the jacobian @xmath37 , the dynamical system ( [ eq : div_u ] ) , ( [ eq : ns_strat ] ) and ( [ eq : cons_masse ] ) is expressed as @xmath38 differentiating equation  ( [ equationenpsi ] ) with respect to time and equation  ( [ equationenrho ] ) with respect to the spatial variable @xmath7 , and subtracting the latter from the former , one gets finally @xmath39 describing the nonlinear dynamics of non - rotating non - diffusive viscous stratified fluids in two dimensions .      in the linear approximation , assuming vanishing viscosity , the right - hand side of equation  ( [ equationenpsietrho ] ) immediately vanishes leading to the following wave equation for the streamfunction @xmath40 this equation is striking for several reasons .",
    "first , its mathematical structure is clearly different from the traditional dalembert equation .",
    "indeed , the spatial differentiation appears at second order in both terms .",
    "time - harmonic plane waves with frequency @xmath41 , wave vector @xmath42 and wavenumber @xmath43 are solutions of equation  ( [ eq_disp_gravity_non_viscous ] ) , if the dispersion relation for internal gravity waves @xmath44 is satisfied .",
    "@xmath45 is the angle between wavenumber @xmath46 and the vertical .",
    "the second important remark is that contrary to the usual concentric waves emitted from the source of excitation when considering the dalembert equation , here four different directions of propagation are possible depending on the sign of @xmath47 and  @xmath48 .",
    "this is an illustration of the anisotropic propagation due to the vertical stratification .",
    "the third remarkable property is that the dispersion relation features the angle of propagation rather than the wavelength , emphasizing a clear difference between internal waves and surface waves .",
    "this is also a crucial property for this review since it will allow us to define beams with a general profile , rather than with a single wavenumber .",
    "it is striking and pretty unusual that plane waves are solutions of the inviscid nonlinear equation  ( [ equationenpsietrho ] ) even for large amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the streamfunction of the plane wave solution is a laplacian eigenmode , with @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , the first jacobian term vanishes in equation  ( [ equationenpsietrho ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ equationenpsi ] ) leads therefore to the so - called polarization relation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the polarization prefactor .",
    "consequently , the second jacobian in ( [ equationenpsietrho ] ) vanishes : @xmath52 . to conclude , both nonlinear terms in equation  ( [ equationenpsietrho ] ) vanish for plane wave solutions , that are therefore solutions of the nonlinear equation , for any amplitude .",
    "since the frequency @xmath41 is independent of the wavenumber , it is possible to devise more general solutions , time - harmonic with the same frequency  @xmath41 , by superposing several linear solutions associated to the same angle of propagation , but with different wavenumbers @xmath53  @xcite . introducing the along - beam coordinate @xmath54 , defined along the direction of propagation , and the cross - beam coordinate @xmath55 ( see * figure  [ profilselonetabb ] * )",
    ", the plane wave solution can be written as @xmath56 since @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "if one introduces @xmath59 , one obtains the velocity field @xmath60 and the buoyancy perturbation @xmath61    one can actually obtain a wider class of solutions by considering an arbitrary complex amplitude @xmath62 . indeed , the fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 do not depend on the longitudinal variable @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , after the change of variables , the jacobians , which read @xmath66 , simply vanish , making the governing equations linear . as discussed in  @xcite , note that uni - directional beams , in which energy propagates in one direction , involve plane waves with wavenumbers of the same sign only : @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "we see that the class of propagating waves that are solutions of the nonlinear dynamics in a boussinesq stratified fluid is much more general than plane wave solutions : there is a whole family of solutions corresponding to uniform plane waves in the longitudinal direction  @xmath65 , but with a general profile in the cross - beam direction  @xmath69 , as represented in * figure  [ profilselonetabb]*.     and @xmath69 , of the angle of inclination @xmath45 , and finally of the group and phase velocities @xmath70 and  @xmath71 .",
    "( b ) geometry of a uniform ( along  @xmath65 ) internal wave beam inclined at an angle @xmath45 with respect to the horizontal .",
    "the beam profile varies in the cross - beam @xmath69 direction , and the associated flow velocity is in the along - beam direction  @xmath65 .",
    "the transverse horizontal direction is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] -.5truecm    @xcite have generalized those results by computing asymptotic solutions for a slightly viscous nonlinear wave beam with amplitude slowly modulated along @xmath65 and in time .",
    "after considerable manipulation , it turns out that all leading - order nonlinear advective - acceleration terms in the governing equations of motion vanish , and a uniform ( along  @xmath65 ) beam , regardless of its profile ( along  @xmath69 ) , represents an exact nonlinear solution in an unbounded , inviscid , uniformly stratified fluid .",
    "this result not only extends the validity of the  @xcite steady - state similarity solution to the nonlinear regime , but emphasizes how nonlinearity has only relatively weak consequences .",
    "this has profound and useful outcomes on the applicability of results obtained with linear theory , for comparisons with field observations , laboratory experiments or numerical simulations .",
    "the vanishing of the nonlinear contributions is really unexpected and results from the combination of numerous different terms .",
    "@xcite noticed , however , that the underlying reason for the seemingly   miraculous cancellation of the resonant nonlinear terms was the very same one that had been already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "after lengthy calculations , in both cases , the reason is a special case of the jacobi identity @xmath72+j\\left[c , j(a , b ) \\right ] + j\\left[j(a , c),b \\right]=0 $ ] .",
    "@xcite were studying near - critical reflection of a finite amplitude internal wave on a slope to heal the singularity occurring in the solution of  @xcite .",
    "using matched asymptotic , they took a distinguished limit in which the amplitude of the incident wave , the dissipation , and the departure from criticality are all small .",
    "at the end , although the reconstructed fields do contain nonlinearly driven second harmonics , they obtained the striking and unusual result that the final amplitude equation happens to be a linear equation .",
    "the underlying reason was already this jacobi identity .    to conclude , the effects of nonlinearities on plane waves or wavebeams exhibit very peculiar properties .",
    "there are two important points to keep in mind .",
    "first , plane waves and internal wave beams are solutions of the full equation .",
    "second , identifying a solution does not mean that it is a stable one .",
    "this remark is at the core of the present review : we will focus in the following on the behavior of wave beams with respect to the triadic resonant and the streaming instabilities .",
    "it was first realized fifty years ago that internal gravity plane waves are unstable to infinitesimal perturbations , which grow to form temporal and spatial resonant triads  @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear instability produces two secondary waves that extract energy from a primary one .",
    "energy transfer rates due to this instability are now well established for plane waves  @xcite .    the instability was observed in several laboratory experiments  @xcite and numerical experiments on propagating internal waves  @xcite or reflecting internal tides on a horizontal or sloping boundary  @xcite .",
    "oceanic field observations have also confirmed the importance of this instability , especially close to the critical latitude , where the coriolis frequency is half of the tidal frequency  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments by @xcite , however , followed by a simple model and numerical simulations by @xcite as well as a theory by @xcite have shown that finite - width internal gravity wave beams exhibit a much more complex behavior than expected in the case of interacting plane waves .",
    "this is what will be discussed in this section .",
    "the classic triadic resonant instability corresponds to the destabilization of a primary wave through the spontaneous emission of two secondary waves .",
    "the frequencies and wave vectors of these three waves are related by the spatial , @xmath73 , and the temporal , @xmath74 , resonance conditions , where the indices 0 and @xmath75 refer respectively to the primary and secondary waves .    in the inviscid case",
    ", the most unstable triad corresponds to antiparallel , infinitely long secondary wave vectors associated with frequencies which are both half of the primary wave frequency : @xmath76 . because of the direct analogy with the parametric oscillator , this particular case defines the parametric subharmonic instability ( psi ) .",
    "this special case applies to many geophysical situations , and especially for oceanic applications .    in laboratory experiments",
    ", viscosity plays an important role and the two secondary wave frequencies are different . by abuse of language ,",
    "some authors have sometimes extended the use of the name psi to cases for which secondary waves do not oscillate at half the forcing frequency . to avoid confusion , in the general case",
    ", it is presumably more appropriate to use the acronym  tri .        looking for solutions of the basic equations  ( [ equationenpsi ] ) and  ( [ equationenrho ] ) as sum of three plane waves as follows @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with @xmath79 for the primary wave and @xmath80  for the secondary ones , and denoting @xmath81 the derivative of the amplitude @xmath82 , one gets ( see for example  @xcite ) @xmath83 e^{i \\left(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ k$}_j \\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } - \\omega_j t\\right ) } + c.c . &",

    "a vanishingly small amplitude noise induces the growth of two secondary waves by a triadic resonant mechanism . since their sum gives the primary frequency ( see equation  ( [ temporalcondition ] ) ) ,",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 are subharmonic waves .",
    "the growth rate of the instability depends on the characteristics of the primary wave , namely its wave vector , its frequency and its amplitude  @xmath95 , but also on the viscosity  @xmath23 .      using the dispersion relation for internal waves",
    ", the temporal resonance condition leads to  @xcite @xmath104 whose solutions are presented in * * figure  [ dessindelacacouete]**a .",

    "the wavelength of the secondary waves generated by the instability can be    * both smaller than the primary wavelength : this case corresponds to the external branch of the resonance locus and implies an energy transfer towards smaller scales ( represented by black curves in * figure  [ dessindelacacouete ] * ) . *",
    "one larger and the other one smaller : this case corresponds to the central branch of the resonance locus and implies an energy transfer towards smaller and larger scales ( represented by solid green curves in * figure  [ dessindelacacouete ] * ) .    among the different possible solutions on the resonance locus",
    ", the one expected to be seen experimentally or numerically is the one associated with the largest growth rate . in the inviscid case , the most unstable growth rate occurs for @xmath115 , with essentially @xmath116 , and therefore @xmath117 .",
    "this ultraviolet catastrophe is healed in the presence of viscosity , which selects a finite wavelength for the maximum growth rate @xcite as shown in figure  [ dessindelacacouete]c . for typical laboratory scale experiments , the values of @xmath118 corresponding to significant growth rates",
    "are of the same order of magnitude as the primary wavenumber @xmath119 , as can be seen in * figure  [ dessindelacacouete]c * , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "thus , tri corresponds to a direct energy transfer from the primary wave to small scales where viscous effects come into play , without the need of a turbulent cascade process .",
    "the fact that viscosity has a significant effect on the selection of the excited resonant triad , preventing any large wave number secondary wave to grow from the instability , has been observed by @xcite in laboratory experiments on wave beams .",
    "however , they also found a different type of triads than those predicted by the previous theoretical arguments .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the following sections .",
    "the expression for the growth rate @xmath122 implies that the amplitude of the stream function has to be larger than the critical value @xmath123 to get a strictly positive growth rate  @xcite . the threshold for the instability is thus given by the global minimum of this function of several variables .",
    "let us focus on the particular case where @xmath106 tends to @xmath105 by considering the following description of the wave vector components @xmath124 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , while @xmath128 and @xmath129 are positive quantities . using the dispersion relation , the temporal and spatial resonance conditions ,",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath130 is the only acceptable value to balance the lowest order terms . plugging these relations into the expression of @xmath131 , one gets @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which leads to @xmath134 .",
    "the minimum of this positive expression being zero , it shows that there is no threshold for an infinitely wide wave beam , even when considering a viscous fluid .",
    "plane wave solutions are thus always unstable to this triadic resonant instability .      the above theory for the tri does not take into account the finite width of the experimental beam .",
    "qualitatively , the subharmonic waves can only extract energy from the primary wave if they do not leave the primary beam before they can extract substantial energy  @xcite .",
    "the group velocity of the primary wave is aligned with the beam , but the group velocity of the secondary waves is definitely not , and these secondary waves eventually leave the primary wave beam , as illustrated in * figure  [ dessindelavitessedegroupe]*. this is a direct consequence of the dispersion relation , which relates the direction of propagation to the frequency : a different frequency , smaller for subharmonic waves , will lead to a shallower angle .",
    "three comments are in order :    \\i ) the angles between primary and secondary waves strongly influence the interaction time , and thus the instability .",
    "\\ii ) secondary waves with small wave vectors , having a larger group velocity  @xmath135 , leave the primary wave beam more rapidly and have less time to grow in amplitude .",
    "such solutions will therefore be less likely to develop , opening the door to stabilization of the primary wave by the finite width effect .",
    "this clarifies why experiments with the most unstable secondary waves on the internal branch ( small wave vector case ) of the resonance locus ( * figure  [ dessindelavitessedegroupe ] * ) were found to be stable  @xcite contrary to the prediction for plane waves .",
    "this decisive role of the group velocity of the short - scale subharmonic waves was identified long ago by @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) at the other end of the spectrum , small wavelengths are more affected by dissipation and will also be less likely to be produced by tri .",
    "consequently , only a window of secondary wavelengths is possibly produced by tri .    .",
    "( c ) the vector triad with the three arrows representing the primary wave vector @xmath105 ( black ) and the two secondary waves vectors @xmath106 ( red ) and @xmath107 ( blue ) . from this triad , it is possible to deduce the orientation of the group velocities of the three different waves as shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=99.0% ] -.5truecm      a simple energy balance proposed by  @xcite makes possible an insightful and more quantitative estimate for the most unstable triad .",
    "we introduce the tilted rectangle shown in * figure  [ dessindelavitessedegroupe ] * as control area ( denoting @xmath136 the perpendicular beam width ) and we neglect the spatial attenuation of the primary wave in this region ( `` pump - wave '' approximation ) .",
    "since secondary waves do not propagate parallel to the primary beam , they exit the control area from the lateral boundaries without compensation .",
    "equation ( [ equation1z ] ) is thus modified as follows @xmath137 the first term represents the interaction with the other plane waves of the triadic resonance , the second term is due to viscous damping while the third one accounts for the energy leaving the control area .",
    "one finds here also exponentially growing solutions with a positive growth rate slightly modified as @xmath138 in which the effective viscous term now reads @xmath139 .",
    "the finite width of the beam is responsible for a new term characterizing the transport of the secondary waves energy out of the interaction region . for infinitely wide wave beams ( @xmath140 ) , one recovers the growth rate @xmath122 obtained in the plane wave case .",
    "in contrast , when the beam becomes narrow ( @xmath141 ) , the growth rate decreases to zero , leading to a stabilization .    the finite width of a wave beam increases therefore its stability , owing to the transport of the secondary waves out of the triadic interaction zone of the primary wave beam before they can extract substantial energy .",
    "this interaction time scales directly with the perpendicular beam width , @xmath136 as can be seen from the expression of @xmath142 .",
    "a beautiful weakly nonlinear asymptotic analysis of the finite width effect on tri has been recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "mostly interested by oceanic applications , they look for subharmonic perturbations in the form of fine - scale , nearly monochromatic wavepackets with frequency close to one half of the primary frequency ; in this limit , usually called parametric subharmonic instability ( see the sidebar distinguishing tri vs. psi ) , @xmath143 , that defines the angle  @xmath144 with the vertical of the wave vectors @xmath145 of opposite directions .    the key ingredient in the analytical derivation is to take advantage of the scale difference between the width of the primary beam  @xmath136 and the very small carrier wavelength of the subharmonic wave packets @xmath146 .",
    "the small amplitude expansion is thus characterized by the small parameter @xmath147 .",
    "they consider an expansion with not only the underlying wave beam but also the superimposed subharmonic wavepackets that appear to order @xmath148 .",
    "the derivation of the wave - interaction equations leads to six coupled equations for the two primary beam envelopes ( two because of the two phases ) and the four ( @xmath149 ) subharmonic wavepacket envelopes .",
    "fortunately , this system can be reduced at leading order to only three coupled equations with three unknowns .    taking a distinguished limit in which not only the amplitude of the primary wave , but also the nonlinear , dispersive and viscous terms are all small",
    ", they obtain a reduced description of the dynamics .",
    "the strategy is as usual to choose the scaling in order to get comparable magnitudes of the different terms . interestingly ,",
    "as only the quadratic interaction is potentially destabilizing for the primary beam , they compare it with the advection term for subharmonic waves : the former being smaller , this confirms that the resonant interaction can not feed the instability in the limited time during which perturbations are in contact with the underlying beam .",
    "beams with a general profile of finite width are thus stable to tri .",
    "next , they consider the case of beams with profiles in the form of a monochromatic carrier with @xmath150 wavelength , modulated by a confined envelope",
    ". functions of the cross - beam direction @xmath69 ( see  * figure  [ profilselonetabb ] * ) and of the appropriate slow time @xmath151 , the complex envelopes @xmath152 and @xmath153 , of the primary and secondary waves are thus generalizations of the plane wave solutions considered in section  [ derivequplanewaves ] .",
    "we recover these solutions with an envelope function independent of the cross - beam coordinate @xmath69 , while an internal wave beam ( such as the one in * figure  [ dessindelavitessedegroupe ] ) * will correspond to @xmath154 for @xmath155 and zero otherwise . introducing the appropriate change of variables and rescaling of the relevant variables , the beam envelope @xmath95 and the complex subharmonic envelopes @xmath156 are linked through the following three coupled dimensionless equations @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the renormalized viscous dissipation and @xmath159 a rescaled wavenumber modulus . @xmath160 and @xmath161 are two geometrical parameters , while @xmath151 is the appropriate slow time for the evolution of the subharmonic wave packets and @xmath69 the appropriate cross - beam coordinate .    in the appropriate distinguished limit identified by  @xcite ,",
    "the nonlinear term is balanced as in section  [ energyapproach ] by the viscous term , but also by the transport term .",
    "the coupling between the evolution equations occurs through the nonlinear terms , which allow energy exchange between the underlying beam and subharmonic perturbations .",
    "the subsequent behavior of the complex envelopes  @xmath156 determines the stability of the beam : if they are able to extract energy via nonlinear interaction with  @xmath95 at a rate exceeding the speed of linear transport and viscous decay , the beam is unstable .    from this system ,",
    "it is in principle possible to study the stability of any profile :    1 .   for example , a time independent beam @xmath162 is a steady state solution of this system of three equations .",
    "the study of its stability relies on looking for the normal mode solutions @xmath163 . for a plane wave ,",
    "one obtains the growth rate @xmath164 .",
    "a subtle point was carefully emphasized by  @xcite .",
    "the above expression of @xmath122 seems independent of the wave vector disturbance @xmath165 in the inviscid limit , but the derivation has extensively used the hypothesis of fine - scale disturbances , that will of course break down for @xmath166 . the maximum growth rate is indeed attained for finite but small @xmath165 .",
    "uniform beams ( internal plane waves with a confined envelope ) are unstable if the beam is wide enough .",
    "2 .   @xcite",
    "provide also the solution of the initial value problem for a beam with @xmath167 tending towards zero as @xmath69 tends to infinity .",
    "they show the existence of a minimum value for the unstable perturbation wavenumber @xmath168 , corresponding to a maximum wavelength .",
    "therefore , the possible spatial scale window for secondary wavelengths shrinks towards smaller scales as the beam is made narrower . outside this range ,",
    "no instability is possible even in the inviscid case .",
    "they derive also analytically the minimum width explicitly for the top - hat profile used in the experiments by  @xcite ( @xmath154 for @xmath155 and zero otherwise as shown in * figure  [ dessindelavitessedegroupe ] * ) .",
    "they argue that the existence of a minimum width is valid for a general profile .",
    "this minimum is dependent on the beam shape .    to summarize , internal plane waves with a confined envelope are unstable if the beam is wide enough , while weakly nonlinear beams with a general but confined profile ( i.e. without any dominant carrier wavenumber ) are stable to short - scale subharmonic waves .",
    "@xcite have recently studied theoretically and numerically the triadic resonant instability of an internal gravity beam in presence of a mean advective flow .",
    "they keep constant the local wave vector and wave frequency in the frame moving with the fluid in order to encompass both tidal flows and lee waves .",
    "their main result is that , by impacting the group velocity of the primary and secondary waves , the mean advection velocity modifies the most unstable triads .",
    "they have predicted and confirmed numerically that a strong enough advective flow enhances the instability of the central branch ( leading to large scale mode since one secondary wavelength is larger than the primary one ) with respect to the external branch .",
    "however , the model is not able to explain the existence of an interesting stable region , at intermediate velocity in their numerical simulations . to go beyond",
    ", it would be necessary to take into account the spatial growth of the secondary waves within the internal wave beam .",
    "such a theory relying on the extension of the classical absolute or convective instability is still to be derived .",
    "when one includes coriolis effects due to earth s rotation at a rate  @xmath169 , the dispersion relation of internal waves is modified and this has of course consequences on the group velocity , which we showed to be intimately associated to the stability of internal wave beams .",
    "@xcite have reported experimental signatures of triadic resonant instability of inertial gravity beams in homogenous rotating fluid .",
    "it is thus expected that tri will also show up when considering stratified rotating fluid .",
    "assuming invariance in the transverse @xmath8 direction , the flow field may be written as @xmath170 with @xmath171 the streamfunction of the non - divergent flow in the vertical plane , and @xmath172 the transverse velocity . introducing the coriolis parameter @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the latitude , the dynamics of the flow field is given by the following system of three equations @xmath175 in which the equation for the buoyancy perturbation is not modified , while equation  ( [ equationenpsi ] ) has been modified and is now coupled to the dynamics of the transverse velocity @xmath18 .",
    "as previously , one can study beams of general spatial profile , corresponding to the superposition of time - harmonic plane waves with a dispersion relation  ( [ eq_disp_gravity_theta ] ) modified into @xmath176 the next step is again to look for subharmonic perturbations in the form of fine - scale ( with respect to the width of the beam ) , nearly monochromatic wavepackets with frequency close to half the primary frequency .",
    "it is straightforward to see that subharmonic waves propagate with an inclination  @xmath144 given by @xmath177 that vanishes when @xmath178 , i.e. at the critical latitude @xmath179  @xcite .",
    "the modulus of the group velocity of subharmonic waves @xmath180 will thus also vanish at this latitude . the rotation reducing dramatically the ability of subharmonic waves to escape",
    ", it may seriously reinforce the instability .",
    "@xcite have shown that it is possible to reproduce the asymptotic analysis of the triadic resonant instability with the inclusion of earth s rotation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one ends up with an unchanged equation  ( [ equationforq ] ) for the dynamics of the primary wave , while the coupled dynamics of subharmonic waves is modified as follows @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath183 two parameters depending on the coriolis parameter @xmath184 , which vanish when @xmath184 tends to zero .",
    "the important modification is the appearance , on the right - hand side , of the second linear term due to dispersion .",
    "it is important here because the first one may disappear since the projection of the respective group velocity @xmath185 of subharmonic envelopes @xmath156 on the across beam direction @xmath186 may vanish .",
    "@xcite consider first weakly nonlinear sinusoidal wavetrains , emphasizing two interesting limits : the case far from the critical latitude allows one to recover the results of section  [ theoryinthenearlyinviscidlimit ] in which there is no preferred wavelength of instability in the inviscid limit . on the other hand ,",
    "when the group velocity of perturbations vanishes at the critical latitude , energy transport is due solely to second - order dispersion .",
    "this process of energy transport leads to the selection of a preferred wavenumber , independent of damping effects , which may suppress the instability for a sufficiently large damping factor , permitting the underlying wave to survive the instability .",
    "they obtained an expression for the growth rate identical to the result in the inviscid limit of  @xcite .",
    "it explains that , at the critical latitude , additional physical factors , such as scale - selective dissipation , must become important .",
    "this result has been shown numerically by  @xcite in agreement with in situ measurements  @xcite .    for beams ,",
    "there is always a competition between energy extraction from the beam , which varies with beam profile , and the proximity to the critical latitude , without forgetting the viscous effects on the fine - scale structure of disturbances .",
    "relying on numerical computations , it is possible to predict the stability properties for a given profile . in general , it turns out that rotation plays a significant role in dictating energy transfer from an internal wave to fine - scale disturbances via tri under resonant configurations .      until now ,",
    "the only laboratory experiment that studied the influence of rotation on the triadic instability of inertia - gravity waves , in a rotating stratified fluid , was performed recently by  @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the set - up that was used by  @xcite was placed on a rotating platform , with a range of rotation rates from 0 to 2.16 rpm , allowing the dimensionless coriolis parameter , @xmath187 , to vary in a range from 0 to 0.45 .",
    "one of their main findings is the observation that the tri threshold in frequency is lowered ( by about 20% ) , compared to the non - rotating case .",
    "an extension of the energy approach developed in section  [ energyapproach ] to the rotating case confirms this observation , by showing that the finite - size effect of the beam width is reduced when rotation increases .",
    "this enhancement of tri only applies to a limited range of rotation rate since , when the rotation rate overcomes half the primary wave frequency , tri is forbidden due to the dispersion relation not allowing the existence of the lowest - frequency secondary wave .",
    "the competition between this limit and the finite - size effect reduction by rotation results in a minimum value for the frequency threshold .",
    "the position of this minimum , observed around @xmath188 in the experiment , depends on the reynolds number , defined as @xmath189 .",
    "the transposition of this result to high reynolds number situations like in the ocean shows that the tri enhancement is then localized in a narrow coriolis parameter range , with @xmath190 , thus recovering the critical latitude phenomenon .    when global rotation is applied to the fluid",
    ", another interesting feature is that it creates an amplitude threshold for tri .",
    "indeed , it was discussed in section  [ threshold ] that in the absence of rotation , plane waves were always unstable . however , as shown in this section , the instability at very low amplitude occurs when @xmath191 tends towards @xmath192 , which implies @xmath193 and therefore @xmath194 .",
    "but when there is rotation in the system , a zero - frequency subharmonic wave is no longer allowed , hence the appearance of a threshold in amplitude , which increases with @xmath187 .",
    "another important mechanism for the instability of internal gravity waves beams is the generation of a mean flow , also called streaming instability by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noticed in early times that internal gravity wave beams share several properties with acoustic wave beams .",
    "in particular , both kinds of waves may be subject to streaming in the presence of dissipative effects .",
    "streaming refers here to the emergence of a slowly evolving , non - oscillating , eulerian flow forced by nonlinear interactions of the oscillating wave - beam with itself  @xcite .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , it is now recognized that streaming occurs actually in a variety of flow models ; it remains an active field of research for both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite points of view .",
    "the fact that dissipative effects are required to generate irreversibly a mean flow through the nonlinear interactions of a wave beam with itself can be thought of as a direct consequence of `` non - acceleration '' arguments that came up in the geophysical fluid dynamics context fifty years ago with important contributions from  @xcite , among others .",
    "@xcite used those ideas to propose an idealized model for the quasi - biennal oscillation ( qbo ) , together with an experimental simulation of the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the oscillations require more than one wave beam , but @xcite discussed first how a single wave beam propagating in a vertical plane could generate a mean flow .",
    "he predicted the vertical shape of this mean flow , emphasizing the important role played by the wave attenuation through dissipative effects .",
    "the experiment by @xcite may be thought of as the first quantitative observation of streaming in stratified fluids .",
    "those examples correspond , however , to a very peculiar instance of streaming , with no production of vertical vorticity .",
    "by contrast , most applications of acoustic streaming since the earlier works of @xcite and @xcite involve the production of vorticity by an irrotational wave .",
    "as far as vortical flows are concerned , @xcite noticed important analogies between acoustic waves and internal gravity waves : in both cases , vortical flows and propagating waves are decoupled at a linear level in the inviscid limit , and steady streaming results from viscous attenuation of the wave amplitude .",
    "in particular , @xcite noticed that streaming could generate a flow with vertical vorticity .",
    "however , experimental observation of the emergence of a vortical flow in stratified fluids through this mechanism remained elusive until recently . while studying the internal wave generation process via a tidal flow over 3d seamounts in a stratified fluid",
    ", @xcite observed a strong flow in the plane perpendicular to the oscillating tidal flow . for low forcing",
    ", this flow was found to be proportional to the square of the forcing amplitude . that led them to invoke nonlinear interactions , either between the internal wave beam and itself , or between internal waves and the viscous boundary layer .",
    "the analysis was not pursued further , and the sign of the vorticity generated , opposite to the one discussed in next subsections , remains puzzling .",
    "a few years later , studying the reflection of an internal wave beam on a sloping bottom , grisouard and his collaborators have also discovered this mean - flow generation in experiments @xcite .",
    "the basic configuration was an uniform beam reflecting onto a simple slope in a uniformly stratified fluid .",
    "as predicted @xcite , the interaction between the incident and reflected waves produced harmonic waves , thereby reducing the amplitude of the reflected wave .",
    "however , more surprisingly , they found that the reflected wave was nearly absent because a wave - induced mean flow appeared in the superposition region of the incident and reflected waves , progressively growing in amplitude . comparing two- and three - dimensional numerical simulations",
    ", they showed that this mean flow is of dissipative origin and three - dimensional .",
    "its presence totally modifies the two - dimensional view considered in the literature for reflection of internal waves .",
    "indeed , there has been many interesting theoretical studies of internal gravity waves - mean flow interactions @xcite , but none of them considered the effect of dissipation in three dimensions .",
    "the complete and theoretical understanding of the generation of a slowly evolving vortical flow by an internal gravity wave beam was possible using an even simpler set - up that we describe in the following section .",
    "@xcite reported observations of a strong mean flow accompanying a time - harmonic internal gravity beam , freely propagating in a tank significantly wider than the beam .",
    "we describe below in detail the experimental set - up and the observations , together with two related theories by @xcite and @xcite , which describe well the experimental results , by providing the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the mean flow and illuminating the mechanism of instability . those approaches bear strong similarities with the result obtained by @xcite , who used generalized lagrangian mean theory , in order to describe the emergence of a vortical flow in the presence of an oscillating flow of a barotropic tide above topography variations .",
    "@xcite have studied an internal gravity wave beam of limited lateral extent propagating along a significantly wider stratified fluid tank . previously , most experimental studies that were using the same internal wave generator  @xcite were quasi - two - dimensional ( beam and tank of equal width ) and therefore without significant transversal variations .",
    "* figure  [ setupmanipguilhem]a * presents a schematic view of the experimental set - up in which one can see the generator , the tank and the representation of the internal wave beam generated ( see  @xcite for additional details ) .",
    "the direct inspection of the flow field shows an unexpected and spontaneously generated pair of vortices , emphasized in * figure  [ setupmanipguilhem]b * by the tracer particles dispersed in the tank to visualize the flow field using particle image velocimetry .",
    "this structure is actually a consequence of the generation of a strong mean flow .",
    "this experiment provides therefore an excellent set - up to carefully study the mean - flow generation and to propose a theoretical understanding that explains the salient features of the experimental observations .     for the primary wave ( top plots , obtained by filtering @xcite the velocity field at the forcing frequency ) and the mean flow ( bottom plots , obtained by low - pass filtering the velocity field ) as reported respectively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the four left panels present the side view , while the right ones show the top view .",
    "the wave generator is represented in grey with its moving part in black . ]",
    "these observations are summarized in * figure  [ resultmanipguilhem ] * , which shows side and top views not only of the generated internal wave beam but also of its associated mean flow .",
    "one sees that the wave part of the flow is monochromatic , propagating at an angle @xmath45 and with an amplitude varying slowly in space compared to the wavelength  @xmath195 .",
    "these waves are accompanied by a mean flow with a jet - like structure , in the direction of the horizontal propagation of waves ,   together with a weak recirculation outside the wave beam .",
    "initially produced inside the wave beam , this dipolar structure corresponds to the spontaneously generated vortex shown in * figure  [ setupmanipguilhem]b*. moreover , the feedback of the mean - flow on the wave leads to a transverse bending of wave beam crests that is apparent in * figures  [ resultmanipguilhem]e * and  * [ resultmanipguilhem]f*.        taking advantage of the physical insights provided by the experiments , @xcite have proposed an approximate description that uses a time - harmonic wave flow with a slowly varying amplitude in space .",
    "the problem contains two key non - dimensional numbers , the froude number @xmath196 and the ratio @xmath197 between the wavelength @xmath195 and the attenuation length scale of the wave beam due to viscosity , @xmath198  @xcite . for analytical convenience",
    ", they considered a distinguished limit with the small parameter @xmath199 , together with the scaling @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "as usual , the appropriate scaling in the small parameter  @xmath128 is deduced from a mix of physical intuition and analytical handling of the calculations . in their case",
    ", they were looking for a regime with small nonlinearity and dissipation . in terms of the velocity components",
    "@xmath202 , the buoyancy @xmath64 and the vertical vorticity @xmath203 , the governing dimensionless equations in this three - dimensional setting read now @xmath204 @xmath205 @xmath206 @xmath207 in which the index @xmath208 in @xmath209 and @xmath210 reduces to the horizontal velocity field , gradient or laplacian operator .    introducing rescaled spatial and time coordinates , a multiple scale analysis is now at hand .",

    "nonlinear terms contribute a priori for the first time to order @xmath224 , but one interestingly finds again ( see section  [ nlterms ] ) that they vanish to this order .",
    "to order @xmath225 , one obtains that the term independent of the slow time @xmath226 vanishes and , thus , nonlinear terms do not induce a mean flow to this order either .",
    "it is only to order  @xmath227 that nonlinear terms directly contribute to the mean - flow generation .",
    "the governing equation of the vortical flow induced by the mean flow is then given in the original dimensional units by @xmath228 where the overline stands for the filtering over one period and @xmath229 is the amplitude of the wave envelope .",
    "several conclusions can be directly inferred from this analysis :    \\i ) as emphasized by the first term on the right - hand side , nonlinear terms are crucial as a source of vertical vorticity .",
    "note that one recovers that the amplitude of the mean flow is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude as has been invoked from experimental @xcite or theoretical @xcite results .",
    "\\ii ) the variations of the wave field in the @xmath8-direction ( implying @xmath230 ) are necessary for nonlinearities to be a source of vertical vorticity .",
    "this illuminates why three - dimensional effects are crucial and therefore why no mean - flow generation was noticed in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) finally , the viscous attenuation of the wave field in the @xmath7-direction ( implying @xmath231 ) is also necessary to produce vertical vorticity . in actual experiments , variations of the amplitude in the @xmath7-direction",
    "can also come from finite size effects , but are not sufficient to generate a mean flow .",
    "one drawback of the above approach , however , is that it does not describe the feedback of the mean flow on the waves .",
    "for this reason , the approach becomes inconsistent at long time in the far field region .",
    "the above combined experimental and analytical proof of the key role played by viscous attenuation and lateral variation of the wave beam amplitude in the generation of the observed mean flow has therefore motivated a more careful asymptotic expansion by  @xcite , taking into account the two - way coupling between waves and mean - flow .",
    "this two - way coupling accounts for the horizontal bending of the wave mean - field in @xcite experiments , as explained in section [ completemodel ] .",
    "initially , @xcite were interested in three dimensional perturbations of internal wave beams . specifically , they studied the stability of uniform beams subject to oblique modulations which vary slowly in the along - beam and the horizontal transverse directions .",
    "results turned out to be fundamentally different from that of purely longitudinal modulations considered in  @xcite .",
    "because of the presence of transverse variations , a resonant interaction becomes possible between the primary beam and three dimensional perturbations .",
    "moreover , their analysis revealed that three - dimensional perturbations are accompanied by circulating horizontal mean flows at large distances from the vicinity of the beam .",
    "they studied the linear stability of uniform internal wave beams with confined spatial profile by introducing infinitesimal disturbances to the basic state , in the form of normal modes , not only in the along - beam direction  @xmath65 but also in the horizontal transverse direction  @xmath8 ( see * figure  [ profilselonetabb ] * ) .",
    "they used an asymptotic approach , valid for long wavelength perturbations relative to the beam thickness .",
    "the boundary conditions combined with the matching conditions between the solution near and far from the beam ensure that the primary - harmonic and mean - flow perturbations are confined in the cross - beam direction .",
    "the analysis brings out the coupling of the primary - harmonic and mean - flow perturbations to the underlying internal wave beam : the interaction of the primary - harmonic perturbation with the beam induces a mean flow , which in turn feeds back to the primary harmonic via interactions with the beam . whether this primary - harmonic - mean flow interaction mechanism can extract energy from the basic beam",
    ", causing instability , depends upon finding modes which remain confined in the cross - beam direction .      in a second stage ,",

    ", they were able to fully analyze the mean flow , separately near and far from the beam , before matching both solutions .",
    "they derived a closed system of two coupled equations linking the amplitude of the primary time harmonic @xmath237 and the mean - flow component @xmath238 of the cross - beam velocity field .",
    "the latter appears to be necessary for matching with the mean flow far from the beam .",
    "the equation governing the dynamics of the mean flow reads @xmath239 where @xmath240 stands for the hilbert transform in the transverse coordinate @xmath241 .",
    "this immediately shows that transverse variations @xmath242 of the beam are essential for having a nonzero source term .",
    "since the generated mean vertical vorticity is given at leading order by @xmath243 , a direct comparison with equation  ( [ equationmeanflowguilhem ] ) is possible .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ equationformeanflowinit ] ) , which involves derivatives in both horizontal coordinates corresponds to the term identified by  @xcite , while this more complete analysis sheds light on an additional term deriving from purely transverse variations .    using an intermediate equation , @xcite end finally with the alternative and more elegant form @xmath244\\right).\\label{equationformeanflow}\\ ] ] moreover ,",
    "they show that to match inner and outer solutions , this induced mean flow turns out to be purely horizontal to leading order and also dominant over the other harmonics .",
    "the comparison of this theoretical description agrees very well with the experimental results as beautifully emphasized by the different panels presented in * figure  [ resultmanipguilhem]*.    as far as a comparison with the experimental results of @xcite is concerned , a common caveat of the predictions by @xcite and @xcite is the assumption of small wavelength compared to the length scale of the wave envelope , which is only marginally satisfied in the experiments .",
    "one may for instance wonder if the horizontal structure of the observed waves is primarily due to the feedback of the mean flow on the wave , or to the sole diffraction pattern of the wave due to this absence of scale separation .",
    "this needs to be addressed in future works .",
    "using an analysis based on the generalized - lagrangian - mean ( glm ) theory , @xcite have also studied the role of dissipating oceanic internal tides in forcing mean flows . for analytical convenience ,",
    "they model wave dissipation as a linear damping term @xmath245 in the buoyancy equation ( [ eq : cons_masse ] ) , and neglect the viscous term in the momentum equation  ( [ eq : ns_strat ] ) .    within this framework",
    ", they discuss in detail the range of situations in which a strong , secularly growing mean - flow response can be expected .",
    "their principal results include the derivation of an expression for the effective mean force exerted by small - amplitude internal tides on oceanic mean flows . at leading order , taking into account the background rotation and using a perturbation series in small wave amplitude ,",
    "they derive the following explicit expression @xmath246 for the average over the tidal period of the vertical vorticity .",
    "it is remarkable that one recovers in the presence of rotation a forcing term on the right - hand side that is analogous to the forcing terms obtained by @xcite and @xcite in the non - rotating case . in inviscid rotating flows ,",
    "vortical modes are at geostrophic equilibrium , and there is a frequency gap separating those geostrophic modes from inertia - gravity waves .",
    "this frequency gap generally precludes interactions between geostrophic modes and wave modes .",
    "the work of @xcite , however , shows that the combination of nonlinear and dissipative effects allows for a one - way energy transfer from inertia - gravity wave modes to geostrophic modes , through a genuinely three dimensional mechanism . using equation  ( [ equationbulhlergrisouard ] ) , @xcite compute the effective mean force numerically in a number of idealized examples with simple topographies .",
    "although a complete formulation with dissipative terms in the momentum equation is necessary , the conclusion of this important work by @xcite is that energy of inertia - gravity waves in rotating fluids can be transferred to a horizontal mean flow by a similar resonance mechanism as described in the experiment by @xcite .",
    "one understands therefore that mean flows can be generated in regions of wave dissipation , and not necessarily near the topographic wave source .",
    "we have presented several recent experimental and theoretical works that have renewed the interest of internal wave beams . after emphasizing the reason for their ubiquity in stratified fluids  they are solutions of the nonlinear governing equations  this review has presented the two main mechanisms of instability for those beams :    \\i ) triadic resonant instability .",
    "we have shown that this instability produces a direct transfer of energy from large scales ( primary waves ) to smaller scales ( subharmonic ones ) for inviscid plane waves , but that it is no longer true for internal wave beams since the most unstable triad may combine subharmonic waves with larger and smaller wavelength . moreover ,",
    "the effects of the finite size and envelope shape for the onset of triadic resonant instability have been overlooked .",
    "these features have to be taken into account to safely reproduce the complete nonlinear transfer of energy between scales in the ocean interior or in experimental analog  @xcite , and therefore to find its stationary state , the so - called garrett and munk spectrum  @xcite or its possible theoretical analog , the zakharov spectrum for the wave turbulence theory  @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) streaming instability .",
    "now that the mechanism underlying streaming instability and the conditions for its occurrence have been identified , several other examples will probably be reported in the coming years .",
    "for example , such a mean - flow generation has also been observed in a recent experiment  @xcite for which the reflection of internal gravity waves in closed domains lead to an internal wave attractor .",
    "two lateral stokes boundary layers generate indeed a fully three - dimensional interior velocity field that provides the condition for the mean flow to appear . with a perturbation approach",
    ", @xcite confirmed this theoretically and showed that the generated 3d velocity field damps the wave beam at high wave numbers , thereby providing a new mechanism to establish an energetic balance for steady state wave attractors .",

    "<S> internal gravity waves play a primary role in geophysical fluids : they contribute significantly to mixing in the ocean and they redistribute energy and momentum in the middle atmosphere . until recently </S>",
    "<S> , most studies were focused on plane wave solutions . </S>",
    "<S> however , these solutions are not a satisfactory description of most geophysical manifestations of internal gravity waves , and it is now recognized that internal wave beams with a confined profile are ubiquitous in the geophysical context .    </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss the reason for the ubiquity of wave beams in stratified fluids , related to the fact that they are solutions of the nonlinear governing equations . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus more specifically on situations with a constant buoyancy frequency . </S>",
