    "the discovery of more than 400 exoplanets orbiting solar - type stars by the radial velocity technique have provided a substantial amount of high - quality spectroscopic data ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite have obtained a clear trend [ x / fe ] versus @xmath2 in a sample of 11 solar twins , and claimed ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ramrez et al . 2009 , 2010 ) ) that the most likely explanation to this abundance pattern is related to the presence of terrestial planets in the solar planetary system .",
    "here we summarize the analysis of very high - quality harps and uves spectroscopic data of a sample of 95 solar analogs with and without planets ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see gonzlez hernndez et al .",

    "the stellar parameters and metallicities of the whole sample of stars were computed using the method described in @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundance derived for each spectral line was computed using the lte code moog ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , the slopes of the abundance ratios [ x / fe ] versus @xmath2 in two metal - rich stars , hd  1461 and hd  160691 , containing each of them one super - earth - like planet , with 7 - 11 earth masses , have the opposite sign to what one would expect if the amount of refractory metals in the atmospheres of planet hosts would depend only on the amount of terrestial planets .         in left panel of fig .

    "the steep positive trend in the linear fit for @xmath7  k is probably affected by chemical evolution effects on mn , na and cu . in right panel of fig .",

    "we may conclude that it seems plausible that many of our targets hosts terrestrial planets but this may not affect the volatile - to - refratory abundance ratios in the atmospheres of these stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
