    "the phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory was designed to measure the properties of matter at extremely high temperatures and densities . under such conditions",
    ", there is possibility to produce states of matter that have yet to be observed or studied in the laboratory .",
    "the best known of these is the _ quark - gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) , a form of matter where quarks are not confined within individual baryons but exist as some form of plasma of individual quarks and gluons .",
    "it should be emphasized that the exact properties of this matter are not known and that the characterization of the deconfined state , if such a state is produced , is an essential part of the rhic program .",
    "one fundamental element of the study of ultrarelativistic collisions is the characterization of the interaction in terms of variables such as the energy produced transverse to the beam direction and the number of charged particles .",
    "these two variables are closely related to the collision geometry and are important in understanding global properties of the system during the collision .",

    "the centrality dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath4 is characterized by the number of participants , determined with a glauber model , and is studied as function of the incident energy . @xmath5 and @xmath4 results for all four rhic measurements",
    "are included as part of this study .",
    "the data taken at 19.6 gev is particularly interesting because it allows a close comparison to the lower energies of the cern sps program .",
    "comparisons are also made to previous experiments at the brookhaven ags and cern sps at center - of - mass energies of 4.8 gev , 8.7 gev , and 17.2 gev .",
    "finally , an extensive set of collision models describing the @xmath5 and @xmath4 distributions are compared to the existing data .",
    "phenix is one of four experiments located at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the phenix detector consists of two central spectrometer arms , designated east and west for their location relative to the interaction region , and two muon spectrometers , similarly called north and south .",
    "each central spectrometer arm covers a rapidity range of @xmath6 and subtends @xmath7 in azimuth .",
    "the muon spectrometers both have full azimuthal coverage with a rapidity ranges of @xmath8 ( south ) and @xmath9 ( north ) .",
    "additional global detectors are used as inputs to the trigger and for global event characterization such as vertex , time of event and centrality determination .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the phenix detector subsystems relevant for the physics analysis published here are : the pad chambers used for the charged particle multiplicity measurement , the electromagnetic calorimeter used to measure transverse energy , the beam - beam counter and the zero degree calorimeter , the two detectors used for triggering and centrality determination are described in publications  @xcite .",
    "the analysis procedures to measure @xmath5 and @xmath4 are described in details in publications  @xcite . some additional information concerning the analysis at @xmath1  =  19.6  gev can be found in  @xcite . the preliminary results on @xmath3 at @xmath1  =  62.4  gev use the same technique as implemented at other energies .    for the sake of space we only mention errors relevant to the analyses .",

    "@xcite.[fig : theo_ratio1 ] ]    to summarize , most models reproduce at least some of the data fairly well , but most also fail in describing all the data . since the model results typically are given without systematic errors , it is not entirely straightforward to quantify the level of agreement or disagreement with the data . qualitatively , the models that are most successful in describing both @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the overall trends , both regarding centrality dependence and energy dependence , are _ ampt _ , and the _ hijing _ versions .",
    "_ kln _ and _ minijet _ unfortunately do not give information on @xmath2 but are successful in describing the @xmath3 results .",
    "the @xmath3 results thus can either be described by the initial state saturation scenario ( _ kln _ ) or by the mini - jet models that need an energy - dependent mini - jet cut - off scale as described in  @xcite to reproduce the data .",
    "this paper presents a systematic study of the energy and centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy at mid - rapidity at @xmath1 = 19.6 , 130 and 200 gev .",
    "the yields , divided by the number of participant nucleons , show a consistent centrality dependence ( increase from peripheral to central ) between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for all energies .",
    "furthermore , the increase in the ratio @xmath17 from 19.6  gev to 200  gev is consistent with a 20% increase in @xmath14 with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 shows only a weak centrality dependence at rhic energies .    for the @xmath1 dependence ,",
    "comparisons were made not only among rhic results but also including data from lower energy fixed - target experiments at sps , ags and sis .",
    "a phenomenological fit , scaling logarithmically with @xmath1 , describes both @xmath2 and @xmath3 well for all energies and for the most central collisions .    using the fit results , one can separate two regions with different particle production mechanisms .",
    "the region below sps energy is characterized by a steep increase in @xmath17 @xmath13@xmath14 with @xmath1 , whereas for the energies above sps @xmath17 is found to be weakly dependent on @xmath1 .    within the systematic errors of the measurements",
    "the shape of the centrality curves of @xmath96 vs. @xmath10 were found to be the same in the range of rhic energies and to scale with @xmath102 .",
    "the same trend must be true for @xmath5 because @xmath17 has a very weak centrality dependence .",
    "based on the @xmath2 measurements , the bjorken energy density estimates were performed and @xmath36 was determined to be @xmath39 gev/(@xmath40 ) at @xmath1 = 200  gev for the most central bin .",
    "this is in excess of what is believed to be sufficient for a phase transition to the new state of matter .",
    "the energy density increases by about a factor of 2.6 from sps to rhic energy .    finally , a comparison between the rhic @xmath3 and @xmath2 data and a collection of models was performed .",
    "a few models , notably _ hijing _ and _ ampt _ , reproduce both @xmath2 and @xmath3 rather well for several energies ."
