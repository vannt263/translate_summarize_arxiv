    "the random driving forces have very different origins , in most cases they are gaussian white or colored noise sources , but often these forces must be considered as non - gaussian ones , for example , in sensory and biological systems @xcite . moreover , in many physical and biological systems a deviation of real statistics of fluctuations from gaussian law , leading to anomalous diffusion , is observed @xcite . a suitable mathematical model to describe the anomalous diffusion is the fractional fokker - planck equation , which can be derived from different theoretical approaches @xcite .    in this paper",
