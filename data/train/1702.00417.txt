    "nagaoka s theorem @xcite stands almost alone as a rigorous result about itinerant magnetism .",
    "it predicts the existence of a fully polarized ferromagnetic state as the unique ground state of the @xmath1 hubbard model , when one hole is doped away half - filling and certain connectivity conditions are satisfied . despite its very restricted validity and its thermodynamic irrelevance , the theorem introduced an interesting idea about quantum magnetism : kinetic magnetism , the possibility of magnetic order driven solely by the motion of the electrons .    since the seminal work by nagaoka @xcite , a lot of effort has been dedicated to the study of nagaoka ferromagnetism stability beyond the constraints of the theorem .",
    "in particular , some controversy arose as to whether the fully polarized state survives for a finite density of holes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , large - scale density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations @xcite , among others @xcite seem to have solved the problem , unless for the square lattice , as they predict the existence of nagaoka ferromagnetism up to critical hole density @xmath6 .",
    "little is known about the states that supplant the nagaoka ferromagnet beyond @xmath7 @xcite .    with respect to the @xmath1 condition",
    ", its relaxation leads to the competition between the nagaoka and antiferromagnetic exchange mechanisms .",
    "this entails the instability of the nagaoka phase against phase separation : for @xmath8 , a ferromagnetic polaron around the hole moves on an antiferromagnetic background @xcite .",
    "lastly , the violation of the connectivity condition @xcite can also destabilize the nagaoka phase .",
    "nagaoka s theorem requires that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sign of the hopping amplitudes around the smallest loop of the lattice . when this condition is not fulfilled the hole kinetic energy is frustrated .",
    "kinetic frustration @xcite is a quantum mechanical phenomenon , without classical analog since it originates in the quantum interferences of different hole paths .",
    "a simple way to break the connectivity condition is the consideration of particular signs for the hopping parameters in non - bipartite lattices . as an alternative way",
    ", the hopping integrals can be modulated by a staggered magnetic flux @xcite .    in 2005 ,",
    "haerter and shastry @xcite found that the ground state of the @xmath1 triangular hubbard with @xmath11 a kinetically frustrated system where nagaoka s theorem is not valid ( @xmath12 ) , has a @xmath13 nel order .",
    "more recently , we found another example of kinetic antiferromagnetism , a @xmath14 nel order as the ground state of the square hubbard model with second - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath15 , and we uncovered the classical nature of these antiferromagnets @xcite . at the same time , we proposed a microscopic mechanism responsible for this kinetic antiferromagnetism , based on the relaxation of the kinetic frustration as the hole moves on an antiferromagnetic background .    in order to deepen our understanding of kinetic magnetism , in this work we study the evolution of the nagaoka ferromagnet with kinetically frustrating @xmath0 hoppings . to make it , we solve the @xmath1 hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice and the square lattice with second - nearest neighbor hopping ( see fig .",
    "[ redes ] ) , using the numerically exact dmrg .",
    "as we vary @xmath0 we can move between the two known limits : the nagaoka state ( @xmath16 ) and the novel kinetic antiferromagnet ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the classical order extends for all @xmath0 , ferromagnetic below a critical @xmath18 ( that slightly depends on the lattice ) , and antiferromagnetic above .",
    "we analyze the characteristics of the transition , the antiferromagnetic structure above @xmath18 , and the physical microscopic mechanism at work for each lattice .    beyond the sustained theoretical interest in kinetic magnetism for decades , up to date , there are no clear experimental realization of nagaoka conditions . at the end of this work ,",
    "we briefly mention some recent experimental proposals .",
    "in order to analyze the stability of the nagaoka ferromagnetic state against kinetic frustration , we study the @xmath19 hubbard model , with one hole doped away the half - filled case , on two lattices : the spatially anisotropic triangular lattice and the square lattice with second - nearest neighbor hoppings , as shown in fig .",
    "[ redes ] .",
    "the hubbard model reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 denote pair of sites on each lattice , @xmath22 are the hopping integrals , and @xmath23 is the onsite coulomb repulsion . in fig .",
    "[ redes ] , the solid lines represent @xmath24 ( which we take as the energy scale , @xmath25 ) , while the dashed lines represent @xmath0 , the varying anisotropic hoppings ( second - nearest neighbor hoppings ) for the triangular ( square ) lattice .",
    "it should be noticed that , for @xmath26 the hubbard model on the two lattices are equivalent .",
    "are the kinetically frustrating hoppings .",
    "we take @xmath25 as the energy unit.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    when @xmath27 , the connectivity condition of nagaoka s theorem is fulfilled because the minimal loops for the hole motion are squares with @xmath28 . for finite @xmath0 , the minimal loops are triangles with @xmath29 so , for @xmath30 , the theorem is valid and the ground state is a unique fully polarized ferromagnetic state for both lattices . on the other hand ,",
    "a positive @xmath0 introduces kinetic energy frustration in the hole motion ( @xmath12 ) , invalidating nagaoka s theorem . in a previous work @xcite , we have shown that , in the special case @xmath17 , the ground states have classical antiferromagnetic orders : a @xmath31 pattern for the ( isotropic ) triangular lattice and the usual @xmath32 for the square one .    in this work",
    "we will use dmrg @xcite to solve the ground state of the @xmath1 hubbard model , for @xmath33 .",
    "we apply dmrg to ladders of dimension @xmath34 , with @xmath35 legs ( enough to describe correctly two - dimensional systems @xcite ) and up to @xmath36 rungs .",
    "we impose cylindrical boundary conditions with periodic wrapping in the rung direction and open boundary conditions along the legs .",
    "to maintain errors of the dmrg smaller than symbol sizes in each figure , we have kept up to @xmath37 states , with a truncation error less than @xmath38 .",
    "as we mentioned above , the @xmath16 ground state of hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) is ferromagnetic , while for @xmath17 it exhibits antiferromagnetic order for each lattice @xcite .",
    "hence , there will be a critical value @xmath18 where the nagaoka state is destabilized . to determine @xmath18 , we have resorted to an energy analysis .",
    "let @xmath39 be the ground state energy of the @xmath1 hubbard model , for an @xmath40-site lattice ( with @xmath41 electrons ) and a given sector of the spin projection @xmath42 .",
    "for a given @xmath0 , we have compared the ( ground state ) energies of the different spin projection sectors , from the maximal @xmath43 corresponding to a full spin polarization in the @xmath44 direction to the minimal @xmath45 .",
    "notice that , due to the @xmath46 symmetry of the model , the ferromagnetic nagaoka state is @xmath47-fold degenerate , where @xmath48 is its total spin , and it has projections in all the @xmath42 sectors .    we have found that , for small values of @xmath0 and for both lattices , the computed ground state energies of all the @xmath42 sectors are degenerate ( in particular , @xmath49 ) .",
    "therefore , we can suspect that these degenerate states belong to the nagaoka ground state manifold . as a check",
    ", we have verified that the spin correlations , for different @xmath42 sectors , correspond to a fully saturated ferromagnet ( @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) , discarding then the possibility that the nagaoka state may be degenerate with lower total spin states . on the other hand , for larger values of @xmath0",
    ", we have obtained that the ground state always belongs to the minimal spin projection sector @xmath52 , which would correspond to a total spin @xmath53 .",
    "we have not found partially polarized ground states for any @xmath0 , although we must warn that , very close to the transition point @xmath54 the flattening of @xmath55 makes the numerical treatment harder and less precise . with this caveat , we can say that , at @xmath54 there will be a transition from a nagaoka ferromagnet to a minimal spin state which , later on , we will characterize as an antiferromagnetic state .     for the triangular lattice as a function of @xmath0 , and for different @xmath40-site clusters .",
    "dashed ( solid ) lines correspond to the @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) sector energy . for smaller @xmath0",
    "both energies overlap .",
    "@xmath58 is the thermodynamic limit of the nagaoka state energy .",
    "inset : zoom of the critical region , showing the intersection of @xmath59 with the ferromagnetic energy @xmath58.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to determine the critical @xmath54 firstly we have looked for the @xmath0 value where the degeneracy between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is broken for each lattice . in figs .",
    "[ ene - t ] and [ ene - c ] we show these energies as a function of @xmath0 and for different cluster sizes , for the triangular and square lattices , respectively .",
    "we can see that the degeneracy is broken in the region around @xmath61 , signaling , as we explained above , that the ground state of the systems moves from the highest - spin nagaoka state to another one with minimal total spin .    as the conventional dmrg algorithm uses the @xmath42 quantum number without discriminating between different total spin @xmath62 , we can not compute the energy of the excited @xmath53 state below @xmath18 ( notice that , in this case , the calculated @xmath59 corresponds to the @xmath63 sector energy of the @xmath64 nagaoka ground state ) . therefore , we do not have access to the expected energy level crossing between the highest- and lowest - spin sectors , that would facilitate the determination of @xmath18 . for the square lattice model ,",
    "the lack of the level crossing is not so important as there is an appreciable kink in the ground state energy at @xmath18 ( see main panel of fig .",
    "[ ene - c ] ) .",
    "however , for the triangular case , the transition seems to be much smoother , as is shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ ene - t ] , and , consequently , it is more difficult to estimate the critical point where the degeneracy between @xmath65 and @xmath59 is lost . to avoid this difficulty , we have evaluated @xmath18 extrapolating the level crossing between @xmath59 and the infinite - lattice nagaoka energy , @xmath66 ( see insets of figs .",
    "[ ene - t ] and [ ene - c ] ) .",
    "@xmath66 can be computed exactly as the problem of one hole moving in a ferromagnetic background is identical to the spinless tight - binding system @xcite    .critical @xmath18 values for different @xmath40-site triangular clusters , and its @xmath67 extrapolation limit . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     second , for the square lattice with second - nearest neighbor hoppings , the exact energy of the fully polarized state in the thermodynamic limit is , @xmath68 , ( with @xmath69 ) and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ ene - c ] . in table [ table_ene - c ]",
    "we present the critical values for different @xmath40-site clusters , leading to @xmath70 in the @xmath71 limit .",
    "this value is quite close to the only one that existed in the literature up to the present , @xmath72 obtained within a restricted hilbert space @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with the solution of the simplest systems that preserve the basics of nagaoka physics .",
    "that is , three electrons in hubbard square four - site clusters with nearest - neighbor @xmath24 hoppings and ( a ) @xmath0 hopping along only one diagonal ( triangular lattice ) ; ( b ) @xmath0 hoppings along both diagonals ( square lattice ) @xcite . in both cases",
    ", there is an energy level crossing for some @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath73 the ground state has @xmath74 , corresponding to the nagaoka state , while for @xmath75 the ground state has minimal spin @xmath76 for system ( a ) the transition occurs at @xmath77 while for system ( b ) @xmath78 .",
    "these values roughly correspond to the gap energy @xmath79 between the @xmath74 and @xmath53 ground states for @xmath16 , that is , @xmath80 .",
    "it is remarkable that the critical @xmath18 values for these toy models are very close to the thermodynamic limit ones that we have presented above ( tables [ table_ene - t ] and [ table_ene - c ] ) .",
    "from this fact , we can deduce that the relevant quantum interferences for the nagaoka physics are those associated with the hole motion along the smallest lattice loops .",
    "we want to draw attention to the fact that the critical hoppings for both lattices are very similar ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) , and also they are numerically similar to the critical doping for the destabilization of the nagaoka state for @xmath16 , that is , @xmath6 @xcite . we guess that this agreement is not casual : if the nagaoka ferromagnet , with @xmath16 and one hole doped , is separated by an energy gap @xmath79 of other spin sectors , it is plausible that a `` perturbation '' may destabilize the phase as long as its characteristic energy is of the order of @xmath79 ( in the case of doping , we can associate it with an energy @xmath83 ) .",
    "so , if this argument is correct , we expect a gap of the order of @xmath84 for the @xmath16 nagaoka ferromagnet in the square lattice , a value close to the gap for the 4-site cluster system .",
    "the magnetic properties of the ground state can be inferred from the static magnetic structure factor @xmath85 defined as @xmath86 where @xmath21 run over all sites .",
    "we evaluate @xmath87 for @xmath88 , since all the momenta that belong to the first brillouin zone of each lattice have an equivalent point in this region ; for reference , the edges of the brillouin zones will be displayed in the figures .",
    "the @xmath89 component of each momentum is unequivocally determined by the periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath90 direction ; on the other hand , the open boundary conditions along the @xmath91 direction do not impose any restriction for the @xmath92 component .",
    "therefore , we can take advantage of this freedom to circumvent the discreteness of @xmath93 in the @xmath91 direction .     for the triangular lattice with ( a ) @xmath16 , and (",
    "b ) @xmath17 .",
    "the solid lines indicate the edges of the hexagonal brillouin zones .",
    "notice the discreteness of @xmath89 values.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have observed that @xmath85 exhibits a pronounced peak for a certain momentum ( and equivalent points in the reciprocal space ) , for both lattices , and all @xmath0 , except very close to the critical @xmath54 as we will discuss later .",
    "the intensity of the peak increases linearly with the cluster size , pointing out the existence of long - range magnetic order , and its position determines the magnetic wave vector @xmath94 of the magnetic order .",
    "therefore , besides the nagaoka state , long - range magnetic order is ubiquitous for the studied systems .",
    "next , we analyze the magnetic pattern as a function of the kinetic energy frustrating hoppings @xmath0 .    first , we present the results for the triangular lattice .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath95 sites cluster for the presentation of @xmath85 as , for @xmath35 , it is expected to be the cluster most representative of the two - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "we begin revisiting the two previously known situations : @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for @xmath96",
    "nagaoka s theorem is valid and , consequently , @xmath85 exhibits a sharp maximum at the magnetic wave vector @xmath97 , as it is shown in fig .",

    "the other known case , @xmath17 @xcite , is presented in fig .",

    "we can see two @xmath85 maxima at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , both equivalent and corresponding to the @xmath31 nel order .",
    "now , we analyze the magnetic order for intermediate @xmath0 between the two limits presented above .",
    "as long as @xmath100 we have found ferromagnetic order , that is @xmath101 in agreement with the ground state energy analysis of the previous section .",
    "increasing @xmath0 beyond the critical value , the @xmath85 peak locates at @xmath3 , with @xmath102 changing monotonously from @xmath103 at @xmath104 to @xmath105 at @xmath106 , as it is shown in fig .",

    ", it seems that @xmath102 depends continuously on @xmath0 , although it exhibits a sharp rise close to @xmath18 . for small spiral pitch , the period of the spin pattern along the @xmath91 direction ( @xmath109 )",
    "can exceed the cluster length @xmath110 ( @xmath111 in our case ) , preventing a correct description of the spiral order .",
    "a clear manifestation of this kind of finite size effects is that , very close to the transition , the peaks of the magnetic structure factor are not so pronounced .",
    "for these reasons , we can not state categorically that the transition from the nagaoka state to the spiral one is continuous , although the @xmath102 dependence on @xmath0 suggest it . to underline this point ,",
    "it is worth remembering that , in the previous section , we have seen the ground state energy for the triangular lattice also behaves rather smooth across the transition .",
    "we can speculate that an infinite - order phase transition takes place here , like the one found as a function of doping , for @xmath16 , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from fig .",

    "the magnetic order evolution with second - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath0 is very simple .",
    "below @xmath115 the ground state is the nagaoka ferromagnet , while for @xmath116 it is the @xmath4 nel order .",
    "therefore , the transition is clearly discontinuous , with no intermediate order between the @xmath117 nagaoka and @xmath4 nel states",
    ". it should be remember that , in this case , the ground state energy ( fig .",
    "[ ene - c ] ) exhibits an appreciable non - analytical behavior at the transition .",
    "similar discontinuous transitions occur when kinetic frustration is due to staggered magnetic fluxes @xcite .     for the square lattice with ( a ) @xmath16 , and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "solid lines refer to the edges of the square brillouin zones.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    summarizing , the addition of rather small @xmath0 hoppings ( @xmath118 ) destabilizes the nagaoka state and it induces long - range antiferromagnetic order , whose characteristics depend on the system : a spiral pattern in the triangular lattice , and the usual nel order in the square case .",
    "concerning the physical origin of this kinetic antiferromagnetism , recently we identified its microscopic mechanism @xcite .",
    "while the introduction of @xmath0 increases the hole kinetic energy ( the only one involved for @xmath1 ) in a ferromagnetic background , quantum interference effects can release this kinetic energy frustration if the hole moves along a certain antiferromagnetic pattern .",
    "this release can occur in two different ways , depending on the lattice geometry and the hopping terms : ( a ) the hole acquires a non - trivial spin berry phase due to the antiferromagnetic texture or , ( b ) the magnetic order leads to an effective vanishing of the hopping amplitude along the frustrating loops . in our work ,",
    "the spin - berry phase mechanism is operating for the stabilization of the spiral order in the triangular lattice model since , in that order , the hole acquires a @xmath119 phase when it hopes along one elementary triangle . on the other hand , for the square case",
    ", the effective hole nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude vanishes as a consequence of the antiparallel spin structure of the @xmath14 nel order , and the hole moves only along the diagonal directions .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ( especially to the supplemental material ) , for a more detailed discussion of the kinetic antiferromagnetism mechanism .",
    "finally , we have calculated the magnetic order parameter , that is , the local staggered magnetization @xmath120 , which can be defined as @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the magnetic sublattices .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath123 . on the other hand , for non - collinear magnetic structures , like the @xmath3 spiral",

    "@xcite , we found that , for the particular value @xmath17 and both models , @xmath120 extrapolates to its classical value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there , we argued that the classical value is not reached for finite clusters due to the @xmath46 symmetry of the hubbard model .",
    "one way to confirm this idea , for commensurate magnetic orders , was the finding that the application of a small uniform magnetic field @xmath132 in one sublattice only , was enough to pin the classical order for the finite clusters @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we wonder if the remarkable classical character mentioned above extends to other values of @xmath0 .",
