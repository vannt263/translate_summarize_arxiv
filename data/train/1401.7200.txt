    "the relevant deformation of such cft flows to certain 5d @xmath0 gauge theory , and actually this gauge theory is non - perturbatively well - defined in spite of seeming non - renormalizability .",
    "these 5d scfts , which are ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point theories of 5d @xmath0 gauge theories , were studied from various viewpoints : type i/heterotic duality @xcite , m - theory on a calabi - yau singularity @xcite , type iib 5-brane web configuration @xcite and type iib 7-brane background @xcite . in this paper , we employ the calabi - yau compactification , 5-brane web and 7-brane realization in order to study 5d scfts , and we then find that the branch cut move ( the picard - lefshetz transformation ) @xcite of 7-brane configurations leads to non - trivial duality between web configurations of calabi - yau manifolds , and therefore the corresponding 5d scfts .",

    "our duality between these calabi - yau manifolds is a parent of this 4d seiberg duality .",
