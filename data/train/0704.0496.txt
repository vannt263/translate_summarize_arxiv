    "the fusion of two nuclei occurs at small impact parameters when the overlap between their wave functions is big enough to allow the strong interaction to overcome the coulomb repulsion .",
    "heavy - ion fusion reactions have numerous applications , like the study of high spin states in yrast and super - deformed bands @xcite or the formation of heavy and super heavy elements ( she ) @xcite . induced by beams of unstable nuclei , this mechanism will also allow to produce very exotic species and allow for the study of isospin equilibration in the fused system .",
    "the fusion process can be schematically divided in three steps : _ ( i ) _ an approach phase during which each nucleus feels only the coulomb field of its partner and which ends up when the nuclear interaction starts to dominate , _",
    "( ii ) _ a rapid equilibration of the energy and the angular momentum transfered from the relative motion to the internal degrees of freedom , leading to the formation of a compound nucleus ( cn ) and _ ( iii ) _ a statistical decay of the cn .",
    "lots of theoretical and experimental efforts @xcite are made to understand step _ ( i)_. these studies focus on an energy range located around the fusion barrier . at these energies",
    "the fusion is controlled by quantum tunneling which is strongly influenced by the couplings between the internal degrees of freedom and the relative motion of the two colliding partners .",
    "although the cooling mechanisms involved in _ ( iii ) _ are well known and consist mainly in light particle and @xmath0-ray emission in competition with fission for heavy systems , the initial conditions of the statistical decay depend on the equilibration process _",
    "( ii ) _ which is still subject to many debates nowadays . indeed ,",
    "( ii ) _ is characterized by an equilibration of several degrees of freedom like the shape @xcite or the charge @xcite which can be accompanied by the emission of preequilibrium particles .",
    "such emission decreases the excitation energy and the angular momentum .",
    "the latter quantities are crucial and must be determined precisely because they have a major influence on the cn survival probability and therefore on the synthesis of very exotic systems such as the she .",
    "in this paper we study the equilibration of the charges in fused systems , its interplay with other macroscopic degrees of freedom like the shape and the rotation , and its implications on the statistical decay .",
    "to probe theoretically and experimentally this way to fusion , we use the preequilibrium isovector giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) @xcite .",
    "giant resonances are interpreted as the first quantum of collective vibrations involving protons and neutrons fluids .",
    "the giant monopole resonance can be described as a breathing mode , an alternation of compression and dilatation of the whole nucleus .",
    "the gdr corresponds to a collective oscillation of the protons against the neutrons .",
    "the giant quadrupole resonance consists in a nuclear shape oscillation between prolate and oblate deformations .",
    "many other resonances have been discovered @xcite . in particular giant resonances",
    "have been observed in hot nuclei formed by fusion @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates the survival of ordered vibrations in very excited systems , which are known to be chaotic , even if some giant resonance characteristics like the width are affected by the temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strong couplings between various collective modes which occur for giant resonances built on the ground state @xcite are still present in fusion reactions @xcite",
    ". it might therefore be possible to use the giant resonances properties to probe the nuclear structure of the composite system on its way to fusion .",
    "the choice of the preequilibrium gdr , that is , a gdr excited in step _",
    "( ii ) _ before the formation of a fully equilibrated cn , is motivated by the fact that its properties strongly depend on the structure of the state on which it is built , for instance the deformation @xcite .",
    "the idea is to form a cn with two",
    "n / z asymmetric reactants .",
    "such a reaction may lead to the excitation of a dipole mode because of the presence of a net dipole moment in the entrance channel .",
    "this dipole oscillation should occur _ before _ the charges are fully equilibrated , that is , during the preequilibrium phase in which the system keeps a memory of the entrance channel @xcite .",
    "in addition , for such n / z asymmetric reactions , an enhancement of the fast gdr @xmath0-ray emission is expected as compared to the `` slower '' statistical @xmath0-ray yield @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest since the properties of these gdr @xmath0-rays characterize the dinuclear system which precedes the hot equilibrated cn .",
    "the first experimental indications on the existence of such new phenomenon have been reported in @xcite for fusion reactions and in @xcite in the case of deep inelastic collisions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we study the properties of the preequilibrium gdr using the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) formalism . in sec .",
    "iii we show how an n / z asymmetric entrance channel may increase the fusion - evaporation cross - sections .",
    "finally , we conclude in section iv .",
    "at the early time of the fusion reaction , the system keeps the memory of the entrance channel .",
    "we call this stage of the collision the _ preequilibrium phase _ which ends when all the degrees of freedom are equilibrated in the compound system and when the statistical decay starts",
    ".    one of these degrees of freedom is the isospin , which measures the asymmetry between protons and neutrons . when the two nuclei have different n / z ratios , the proton and neutron centers of mass of the total system do not coincide .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there is a non zero force between the two kind of nucleons which tends to restore the initial isospin asymmetry .",
    "in such a case , an oscillation of protons against neutrons on the way to fusion might occur , that is , the so - called preequilibrium gdr @xcite .    in fusion reactions the shape of the system changes drastically during the preequilibrium phase .",
    "studies of the dynamics in the fusion reaction mechanism requires sophisticated calculations to extract the preequilibrium gdr characteristics ( energy , width ... ) and in turn , on the way to fusion . to achieve this goal",
    ", we choose to use , as in the pioneer work of bonche and ng on charge equilibration @xcite , the tdhf approach because it is a fully microscopic theory which takes into account the quantal nature of the single particle dynamics .",
    "moreover in the present study we will restrict ourself to the observation of one - body observables ( e.g. the density @xmath1 ) which are supposed to be well described by such a mean field approach .",
    "however it is clear that an important challenge is to develop methods going beyond mean field which is beyond the scope of this paper .    in this section",
    "we present quantum calculations on preequilibrium giant collective vibrations using the tdhf theory .",
    "we shall start with a brief description of the tdhf theory in sec .",
    "[ subsec : tdhf ] .",
    "then we examine the role of various relevant symmetries in the entrance channel , namely the n / z and mass symmetries ( sec .",
    "[ delta]-[couplings ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ compar ] we shall compare our results with the experimental data obtained by flibotte _",
    "_ @xcite .      in the tdhf approach @xcite , each single particle wave function is propagated in the mean field generated by the ensemble of particles .",
    "the mean field approximation does not take into account the dissipation due to two - body interactions @xcite .",
    "however tdhf takes care of one - body mechanisms such as landau spreading and evaporation damping @xcite .",
    "quantum effects induced by the single particle dynamics like shell effects or modification of the moment of inertia @xcite are accounted for properly .",
    "the main advantage of tdhf is its fully microscopic treatment of the n - body dynamics with the same effective interaction as the one used for the calculation of the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground sates of the collision partners .",
    "the consistency of the method for the structure of nuclei and the nuclear reactions increases its prediction power and its availability to study the interplay between exotic structures and reaction mechanisms .",
    "moreover the tdhf equation is strongly non linear which is of great importance for reactions around the barrier because it includes couplings between relative motion and internal degrees of freedom of the collision partners .",
    "also tdhf provides a good description of collective motion and can even exhibit couplings between collective modes @xcite .",
    "in fact the tdhf theory is optimized for the prediction of expectation values of one - body observables and gives their exact evolution in the extreme case where the residual interaction vanishes .",
    "however , the tdhf prediction of multipole moments in nuclear collision , for instance , may differ from the correct evolution because of the omission of the residual interaction .",
    "an improvement of the description would be given by the inclusion of the effect of the residual interaction on the dynamics , which would increase considerably the computational time and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the tdhf theory describes the evolution of the one - body density matrix @xmath2 of matrix elements @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the component with a spin @xmath5 and isospin @xmath6 of the occupied single particle wave - function @xmath7 .",
    "this evolution is determined by a non linear liouville - von neumann equation , @xmath8=0 \\label{eq : tdhf}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the matrix associated to the self consistent mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "we have used the code built by p. bonche and coworkers @xcite with an effective skyrme interaction @xcite and sly4@xmath10 parameters @xcite . in its actual version , tdhf does not account for pairing interactions .      as far as the dipole motion in the preequilibrium phase is concerned , it is obvious that the main relevant asymmetry responsible for such a motion is a difference in the charge - to - mass ratio between the collision partners @xcite .",
    "the associated experimental signature is an enhancement of the @xmath0-ray emission in the gdr energy region of the compound system @xcite which is attributed to a dipole oscillation .",
    "several informations about the fusion path can be extracted from such a dipole oscillation and its corresponding @xmath0-ray spectrum . for numerical tractability",
    "we start our study of the fusion process with a light system : @xmath11be+@xmath12s@xmath13ca .",
    "we first deduce the @xmath0-ray spectrum from the dipole motion .",
    "then we study the effects of the deformation of the compound system , and of the impact parameter on this motion .",

    "the expectation value of the conjugated dipole moment @xmath19 is then associated to the relative velocity between protons and neutrons , and is defined by the relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the total proton and neutron moments respectively .",

    "[ asym]-c and [ asym]-b respectively .",
    "the trajectories in both the ( @xmath24,t ) and ( @xmath25,t ) planes exhibit oscillations which we attribute to the preequilibrium gdr .",
    "we also note that @xmath26 oscillates in phase quadrature with @xmath27 and that those oscillations are damped due to the one - body dissipation .",
    "consequently , the plot of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath24 shown in fig .",

    "the gdr period extracted from these plots is around @xmath28 fm / c , which corresponds to an energy of @xmath29 mev .    during the collision and",

    "[ spectre ] , the preequilibrium gdr energy is @xmath37 mev , which corresponds to the previous value deduced from the gdr oscillation period .",

    "the period of the oscillation is around 80 fm / c which is lower than in the fusion case and corresponds to a higher energy ( @xmath41 mev ) as it is shown in the associated gdr @xmath0-ray spectrum in fig .",

    "the lower energy obtained for the fusing system reveals a strong prolate deformation @xcite .",

    "the important point here is that the deformation does not relax and strongly affects the frequency of the oscillations .",

    "the use of lasers with the `` pulse and probe '' technique is expected to give access to the deformation and also to the fission time @xcite .",
    "to better mimic the situation of a fusion reaction , we extended our calculations to non - zero impact parameters .",
    "in fact , a non central collision may excite collective rotational states in the deformed preequilibrated cn .",
    "this rotation may be coupled to the preequilibrium gdr @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the interplay of dipole vibration and deformation can be affected by the rotation .",
    "in addition to the center of mass coordinates with @xmath43 along the beam axis and @xmath70 perpendicular to the reaction plane , we define a new coordinate system @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , where @xmath71 is the deformation axis , and @xmath74 is the rotation axis ( see fig .

    "the dipole oscillation can not occur along the @xmath75 and @xmath74 axis .    for non - central collisions , the oscillation is only forbidden along the @xmath74 axis @xcite . in this case",

    "it is quantified by the dipole moment along @xmath73 which is plotted as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ param ] .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of couplings between rotational and vibrational motions in nuclei .    in this subsection",
    "we have shown that an n / z asymmetry in the entrance channel generates a dipole oscillation during the preequilibrium phase of a fusion reaction . in the next one",
    "we will see that , due to polarization effects , such a motion also occurs in n / z symmetric systems although with a smaller amplitude .",
    "we now examine the situation of a central collision involving two @xmath88 nuclei using the example of @xmath89be+@xmath90s at @xmath69 mev / nucleon ( @xmath89be is bound with a strong prolate deformation in hartree - fock calculations with the sly4@xmath10 force ) . as we can see in fig .",

    "indeed , a mass asymmetry induces a difference in the isovector polarization in the collision partners .",
    "this polarization is due to coulomb repulsion between protons of the colliding nuclei _ before _",
    "the fusion starts @xcite .    to show it ,",
    "let us use an adiabatic approach in which we consider that the polarization of a nucleus at a distance @xmath92 between the centers of mass is generated by the coulomb field of its collision partner .",
