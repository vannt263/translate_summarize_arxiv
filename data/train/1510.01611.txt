    "the accelerated expansion of the universe is strongly manifested after the discovery of unexpected reduction in the detected energy fluxes coming from sne ia @xcite .",
    "other observational data like cmbr , lss and galaxy redshift surveys @xcite also provide evidences in this favor .",
    "these observations propose a mysterious form of force , referred as dark energy ( de ) , reviewed in @xcite , which takes part in the expansion phenomenon and dominates overall energy density of the universe .",
    "this has two remarkable features : its pressure must be negative in order to cause the cosmic acceleration and it does not cluster at large scales . in spite of solid favor about the presence of de from the observations ,",
    "its unknown nature is the biggest puzzle in astronomy . in the last nineties ,",
    "this expansion was detected but the evidence for de has been developed during the past decade .",
    "physical origin of de is one of the largest mysteries not only in cosmology but also in fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "the dynamical nature of de can be originated from different models such as cosmological constant , scalar field models , holographic de ( hde ) , chayplygin gas , polytropic gas and modified gravity theories .",
    "various de models are discussed in the references @xcite .",
    "the modified theories of gravity are the generalized models came into being by modifying gravitational part in general relativity ( gr ) action while matter part remains unchanged . at large distances , these modified theories ,",
    "modify the dynamics of the universe .",
    "the @xmath3 theory is the modification of gr which modifies the ricci ( curvature ) scalar @xmath4 to a general differentiable function .",
    "the gravitational interaction is established through curvature with the help of levi - civita connection .",
    "there is another theory which is the result of unification of gravitation and electromagnetism .",
    "it is based on mathematical structure of absolute or distant parallelism , also referred as teleparallelism which led to teleparallel gravity . in this gravity",
    ", torsion is used as the gravitational field via witzenbck connection .",
    "the modification of teleparallel gravity in the similar fashion of @xmath3 gravity gives generalized teleparallel gravity , @xmath0 gravity where @xmath5 is general differentiable function of torsion scalar .",
    "the search for a viable de model ( representing accelerated expansion of the universe ) is the basic key leading to the reconstruction phenomenon , particularly in modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "this reconstruction scheme works on the idea of comparison of corresponding energy densities to obtain the modified function in the underlying gravity .",
    "daouda et al .",
    "@xcite developed the reconstruction scheme via hde model in @xmath0 gravity and found that the reconstructed model may cross the phantom divide line in future era .",
    "setare and darabi @xcite assumed the scale factors in power - law form and obtained well defined solutions .",
    "farooq et al .",
    "@xcite reconstructed @xmath0 model by taking @xmath6type hde model and discussed its viability as well as cosmography .",
    "they showed that this model is viable , compatible with solar system test , ghost - free and has positive gravitational constant .",
    "karami and abdolmaleki @xcite obtained equation of state ( eos ) parameter for the reconstructed @xmath0 models by taking hde , new agegraphic de as well as their entropy - corrected versions and found transition from non - phantom to phantom phase only in entropy - corrected versions showing compatibility with the recent observations .",
    "sharif and rani @xcite explored this theory via some scalar fields , nonlinear electrodynamics and entropy - corrected hde models and analyze the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "holographic de models are widely used for explaining the present day de scenario and evolution of the universe .",
    "these are based on the holographic principle which naively asks that the combination of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity requires three - dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two - dimensional projection much like a holographic image @xcite .",
    "it is useful to reveal the entropy bounds of black holes ( bhs ) which lead to the formulation of the holographic principle .",
    "it is well established that the area of a bh event horizon never decreases with time so called area theorem .",
    "if a matter undergoes gravitational collapse and converts into a bh , the entropy associated with the original system seems to disappear since the final state is unique .",
    "this process clearly violates the second law of thermodynamics . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "bekenstein @xcite proposed generalized second law of thermodynamics on the basis of area theorem which is stated as , bh carries an entropy proportional to its horizon area and that the total entropy of ordinary matter system and bh never decreases .",
    "mathematically , it can be written as @xmath7 here @xmath8 represents the entropy of matter ( body ) outside a bh and @xmath9 is the entropy of bh .",
    "in the construction of hde model , the relation between ultra - violet ( uv ) ( @xmath2 ) and infra - red ( ir ) ( @xmath10 ) cutoffs as proposed by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite plays a key role .",
    "it is suggested that for an effective field theory in a box of size @xmath10 with @xmath2 , the entropy @xmath11 scales extensively , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "however , the maximum entropy in a box possessing volume @xmath13 ( growing with the area of the box ) behaves non - extensively in the framework of bh thermodynamics so called bekenstein entropy bound . for any @xmath2 ( containing sufficiently large volume ) , the entropy of effective field theory will exceed the bekenstein limit which can be satisfied if we limit the volume of the system as follows @xmath14 where @xmath9 has radius @xmath10 .",
    "it can be seen from the above inequality that ir cutoff @xmath10 ( scales as @xmath15 ) is directly associated with uv cutoff and can not be chosen independently from it .",
    "moreover , there occur some problems in saturating the above inequality because schwarzschild radius is much larger than the box size and hence produces incompatibility problem with effective field theory . to avoid this problem , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a strong constraint on the ir cutoff which excludes all states that lie within the schwarzschild radius , i.e. , @xmath16 here , left and right hand sides correspond to the total energy of the system ( since the maximum energy density in the effective field theory is @xmath17 ) and mass of the schwarzschild bh , respectively .",
    "also , ir cutoff @xmath10 is being scaled as @xmath18 which is more restrictive limit than ( [ 1.6.1z ] ) .",
    "the above relation indicates that the maximum entropy of the system will be @xmath19 .",
    "li @xcite developed the energy density for de model by saturating the above inequality as follows @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimensionless hde constant parameter .",
    "the interesting feature of this density is that it provides a relation between uv ( bound of vacuum energy density ) and ir ( size of the universe ) cutoffs .",
    "however , a controversy about the selection of ir cutoff of hde has been raised since its birth . as a result , different proposals of ir cutoffs for hde and its entropy corrected versions @xcite have been developed .",
    "plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we provide briefly about holographical polytropic de model and some cosmological parameters . in iia , we assume a particular form of hubble parameter and subsequently considering a correspondence between new hde and polytropic gas model of de derived a new form of polytropic gas dark energy that was further assumed to be an effective description of dark energy in @xmath0 gravity to study the cosmological consequences .",
    "in section iib we assume a particular solution for @xmath0 and derive solution for @xmath1 in the backdrop of a correspondence between new hde and polytropic de .",
    "this reconstructed @xmath1 has been utilized to get reconstructed effective torsion eos and statefinder parameters .",
    "also , we compare the obtained results with observational data in section iic . in the next section iii",
    ", we check the stability of reconstructed models in all cases .",
    "we conclude the results in section vi .",
    "holographic reconstruction of modified gravity model is a very active area of research in cosmology .",
    "unfortunately , nature of de is still not known and probably that has motivated theoretical physicists towards development of various candidates of de and recently geometric de or modified gravity has been proposed as a second approach to account for the late time acceleration of the universe . in literature , mostly reconstructed work has been done with polytropic eos , family of holographic de models , family of chaplygin gas , scalar field models in general relativity as well as modified theories of gravity ( in framework of @xmath0 gravity , see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "however , we do holographically reconstruction of polytropic de and based on that we experiment with the cosmological implications of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the polytropic gas model can explain the eos of degenerate white dwarfs , neutron stars and also the eos of main sequence stars .",
    "polytropic gas eos is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a positive constant and @xmath24 is the polytropic index .",
    "the important role played by polytropic eos in astrophysics has been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "it is a simple example which is nevertheless not too dissimilar from realistic models @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are cases where a polytropic eos is a good approximation to reality @xcite . from continuity equation @xmath25 in the present work",
    ", we are considering a correspondence between polytropic de and new hde with an ir cut - off proposed by @xcite with the density given by @xmath26      some cosmological parameters are very important for describing the geometry of the universe which include eos , parameter , deceleration parameter and statefinder etc",
    ". the physical state of a homogenous substance can be described by eos .",
    "this state is associated with the matter including pressure , temperature , volume and internal energy .",
    "it can be defined in the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass density , isotropic pressure and absolute temperature , respectively . in cosmological context , eos is the relation between energy density and pressure such as @xmath30 and is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the dimensionless eos parameter which helps to classify different phases of the universe .    in order to differentiate different de models on behalf of their role in explaining the current status of the universe , sahni et al .",
    "@xcite proposed statefinder parameters .",
    "these are denoted by @xmath33 and are defined in terms of hubble as well as deceleration parameters .",
    "the deceleration parameter is defined as @xmath34 the negative value of this parameter represents the accelerated expansion of the universe due to the term @xmath35 ( indicating expansion with acceleration ) .",
    "the statefinder parameters are given by @xmath36 these parameters possess geometrical diagnostic because of their total dependence on the expansion factor .",
    "the most remarkable feature of @xmath33 plane is that we can find the distance of a given de model from @xmath2cdm limit .",
    "this depicts the well - known regions given as follows : + ( i ) @xmath37 shows @xmath2cdm limit ; + ( ii ) @xmath38 describes cdm limit ; + ( iii ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 constitute quintessence and phantom de regions .",
    "+ moreover , @xmath41 can be expressed in terms of deceleration parameter as @xmath42    both @xmath1 and @xmath43 are categorized as cosmographic parameters .",
    "the cosmographic parameters , being dependent on the only stringent assumption of homogeneous and isotropic universe , marginally depend on the choice of a given cosmological model .",
    "secondly , cosmography alleviates degeneracy , because it bounds only cosmological quantities which do not strictly depend on a model .",
    "the cosmographic set of parameters arising out of taylor series expansion of @xmath44 around the present epoch can be summarized as @xcite @xmath45 differentiating friedman equation with respect to @xmath46 and using eq .",
