    "informally speaking , a compact set @xmath0 in the plane is computable if there exists an algorithm to draw it on a computer screen with any desired precision .",
    "any computer - generated picture is a finite collection of pixels .",
    "if we fix a specific pixel size ( commonly taken to be @xmath1 for some @xmath2 ) then to accurately draw the set within one pixel size , we should fill in the pixels which are close to the set ( for instance , within distance @xmath1 from it ) , and leave blank the pixels which are far from it ( for instance , at least @xmath3-far ) .",
    "thus , for the set @xmath0 to be computable , there has to exist an algorithm which for every square of size @xmath1 with dyadic rational vertices correctly decides whether it should be filled in or not according to the above criteria .",
    "we say that a computable set has a polynomial time complexity ( is _ poly - time _ ) if there is an algorithm which does this in a time bounded by a polynomial function of the precision parameter @xmath2 , independent of the choice of a pixel .    when we talk of computability of the julia sets of a rational map , the algorithm drawing it is supposed to have access to the values of the coefficients of the map ( again with an arbitrarily high precision ) .",
    "computability of julia sets has been explored in depth by m.  braverman and the second author ( see monograph @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they have shown , in particular , that there exist quadratic polynomials @xmath4 with explicitly computable parameters @xmath5 whose julia sets @xmath6 are not computable .",
    "such parameters are rare , however ; for almost every @xmath7 the set @xmath6 is computable . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there exist computable quadratic julia sets with an arbitrarily high time complexity . on the other hand ,",
    "hyperbolic julia sets are poly - time @xcite .",
    "the requirement of hyperbolicity may be weakened significantly .",
    "the first author has shown @xcite that maps with non - recurrent critical orbits have poly - time julia sets . however , even in the quadratic family @xmath8 it is not at present known if @xmath6 is poly - time for a typical value of @xmath5 ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "until now , no examples of poly - time computable julia sets with a recurrent critical point have been known . in this note",
    "we present the first such example .",
    "it is given by perhaps the most famous quadratic map of all  the feigenbaum polynomial @xmath9 .",
    "the feigenbaum map is infinitely renormalizable under period - doubling , and its renormalizations converge to a fixed point of the renormalization operator .",
    "historically , this is the first instance of renormalization in complex dynamics ( see @xcite for an overview of the history of the subject ) . as follows from @xcite ,",
    "the julia set of @xmath9 is computable .",
    "however , infinite renormalizability implies , in particular , that we can not expect to find any hyperbolicity in the dynamics of @xmath9 to make the computation fast .",
    "we find a different hyperbolic dynamics , however , to speed up the computation  the dynamics of the renormalization operator itself . in a nutshell , this is the essense of the poly - time algorithm described in this paper .",
    "the details , however , are quite technical and analytically involved . to simplify the exposition , we prove poly - time computability of the julia set not of the map @xmath9 itself , but of the feigenbaum renormalization fixed point @xmath10 .",
    "the map @xmath10 is not a quadratic polynomial , but it is quadratic - like , it is conjugate to @xmath9 , and its julia set is homeomorphic to that of @xmath9 .",
    "there are two advantages to working with @xmath10 , as opposed to @xmath9 .",
    "firstly , the renormalization - induced self - similarity of the julia set of @xmath10 is exactly , rather than approximately linear .",
    "this allows us to streamline the arguments somewhat , making them easier to follow .",
    "more importantly , as we show , the map @xmath10 itself is poly - time computable ( an efficient algorithm for computing @xmath10 is due to o.  lanford @xcite ) .",
    "hence , our main result ",
    "poly - time computability of the julia set of @xmath10  can be stated without the use of an oracle for the map @xmath10 .",
    "we now proceed to give the detailed definitions and precise statements of our main results .      in this section",
