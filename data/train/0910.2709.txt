    "the vast majority of stars with masses below @xmath5 end their lives as white dwarfs ( wds ) . left to their own devices , wds will just cool and fade away , but wds that form part of close binary systems can interact with their companions , steering away from the normal course of isolated stellar evolution and giving rise to a plethora of astrophysical phenomena .",
    "when the companion of the wd is another compact object ( a second wd , a neutron star [ ns ] , or a black hole [ bh ] ) , we refer to these systems as compact wd binaries , or cwdbs .",
    "the orbital evolution of detached cwdbs is governed by the emission of gravitational waves ( gws , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for systems with small enough separations ,",
    "loss of angular momentum leads to a merger of the two components in a time that is short enough to be of astrophysical interest .",
    "this kind of cwdbs constitute the largest population of galactic gw sources @xcite , dominating the gw foreground for future missions like lisa @xcite .",
    "they can also provide important constraints on the still poorly understood process of common - envelope evolution in binary systems @xcite .",
    "but perhaps the most interesting aspect of cwdbs is the outcome of the merging process at the end of their binary evolution . for systems composed of two co wds",
    "whose combined mass is above the chandrasekhar limit , the merger might trigger a thermonuclear runaway and lead to a type ia supernova ( sn ) explosion @xcite .",
    "this possibility , often referred to as the double degenerate wd ( ddwd ) sn ia progenitor scenario , is the only theoretical model that naturally explains the absence of h in the nebular spectra of type ia sn ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and it has motivated a number of searches for suitable candidate systems .",
    "the most comprehensive of these searches , the spy survey @xcite , examined the spectra of @xmath6 wds to look for radial velocity ( rv ) shifts in the characteristic absorption lines .",
    "the total number of detached ddwds found to date by spy and other surveys is around 100 @xcite , but the periods and mass estimates have only been published for 24 systems @xcite .",
    "so far , none of these systems clearly fulfills the requisites to be a sn ia progenitor .    in this paper and in a companion publication @xcite , we present the first results from swarms , the sloan white dwarf radial velocity data mining survey .",
    "the aim of swarms  is to mine the wd catalog in the spectroscopic data base of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in search of cwdbs .",
    "our ultimate goal is to find the ddwd progenitors of type ia sne , or at least put constraints on the rate of dd mergers in the galactic disk that can be compared with measurements of the local type ia sn rate .",
    "this will allow us to assess the viability of the ddwd progenitor scenario for sn ia .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our data mining strategy is briefly described and compared to the spy survey in section [ sec : strategy ] , using as an example the cwdb sdss j125733.63 + 542850.5  ( henceforth , sdss 1257 + 5428 ) , the first object discovered by swarms . in section [ sec : followup ] , we present the follow - up observations of sdss 1257 + 5428  that we have conducted in order to determine its orbital and spectral parameters . in section [ sec : companion ] , we discuss the implications of our findings for the nature of the unseen companion of sdss 1257 + 5428 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions and outline the future prospects for our survey in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the first version of the sdss wd catalog was published by @xcite .",
    "the most recent version , presented in @xcite ( henceforth , e06 ) , corresponds to data release 4 of the sdss @xcite , and it is currently the largest catalog of its kind , with 9316 spectroscopically confirmed wds .",
    "this number should be roughly doubled in the forthcoming dr7 version .",
    "many publications have analyzed the sdss spectra of wds and related objects like subdwarf stars and cataclysmic variables ( see e06 for a list of references ) , but so far all this work has focused on the final co - added spectra .",
    "all the sdss spectra are in fact taken in three or more exposures , approximately 15 minutes long @xcite , in order to facilitate cosmic ray rejection .",
    "the exact number of exposures and the time lapsed between them varies from plate to plate , depending on the observing conditions at the time , but exposures are usually taken back to back during the same night . starting with dr7 @xcite ,",
    "the individual exposures are available separately , which opens the domain of time resolved spectroscopy in the sdss data base .",
    "the goal of swarms  is to take advantage of this situation in the context of the wd spectra , looking for rv shifts among different exposures of the same object that may be the hallmark of a massive companion . to facilitate the search , we have started by considering only wds with ` dominant type ' da or db in the e06 catalog , i.e. , objects that have a relatively simple spectrum with absorption lines from either h or he",
    ". from this list",
    ", we have discarded any objects with excess flux in the red part of the spectrum , which are usually classified as detached wd+m star binaries @xcite .",
    "this initial triage yields 7956 objects , which we have examined for rv shifts using several automated techniques supplemented by visual examination . a detailed description of our search strategy and the implications for completeness , the derivation of merger rates , and other related issues will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .      before going on to discuss specific results , it is instructive to outline the fundamental differences between swarms  and the spy survey @xcite . at a very basic level ,",
    "both surveys are complementary , because the spy objects were examined for rv shifts from the vlt telescopes in paranal ( chile ) and have therefore mostly southern declinations , while sdss data are taken from the apache point observatory ( apo ) in new mexico and have mostly northern declinations .",
    "the spy survey achieved an excellent rv accuracy of @xmath7 by using the high - resolution uves spectrograph ( @xmath8 ) , but the demands of high - resolution spectroscopy imposed a stringent magnitude cutoff of @xmath9 on the spy wds , even for the large collecting area ( 8.2 m ) of the vlt kueyen telescope @xcite . by comparison , the resolution that can be achieved by swarms  with the spectrographs on the sdss 2.5 m telescope ( @xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much lower , around @xmath11 . but",
    "rv resolution is not the most important factor to find potential ddwd sn ia progenitors .",
    "the most interesting systems are those with relatively massive components , or tight orbits , or both , which are expected to have rv shifts higher than @xmath12 @xcite . moreover , by foregoing the need for high - resolution spectroscopy we can examine dimmer wds and hence many more objects . through a combination of centroid fits and cross - correlation techniques , we have been able to achieve an accuracy of @xmath13 , detecting rv shifts between consecutive sdss exposures in a wd with a @xmath14 magnitude of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , swarmscan examine roughly an order of magnitude more objects than spy , albeit at a much lower resolution .",
    "we can summarize our comparison by saying that spy is better suited for a systematic study of the properties of ddwd systems , but swarms  is better positioned to identify interesting objects , particularly the pre - mergers and sn ia progenitors .      to illustrate the kind of objects that can be found by swarms , we present here results for sdss 1257 + 5428 , the first cwdb identified by the survey . in the e06 catalog ,",
    "sdss 1257 + 5428  was listed as a da wd with a @xmath14 magnitude of @xmath16 ( see table [ tab-1 ] ) .",
    "there are three individual exposures of this wd in the dr7 sdss data base .",
    "the wd is identified as a binary by the large shift in the centroid of the h lines between exposures 0 and 1 ( taken on the night of october 3 2003 ) and exposure 2 ( taken on the following night ; see figure [ fig-1 ] ) .",

    "after a wd in the sdss catalog is identified by swarms  as a member of a binary system , follow - up observations are necessary to determine its period and amplitude , and obtain high signal - to - noise spectra that can be used to measure its effective temperature @xmath71 and gravity @xmath72 , calculate its mass , and constrain the nature of its companion . in the case of sdss 1257 + 5428 , the follow - up observations were conducted with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) at the 3.5 m arc telescope at apo .",
    "a total of 23 spectra were taken on the nights of february 5 , 6 , and 14 , 2009 .",
    "we used the b1200 grating with a 1.5 \" slit to achieve a 0.62   dispersion and a fwhm 1.8   resolution .",

    ", we have co - added the 23 apo spectra after removing the rv shifts .",
    "the resulting spectrum has a s / n of @xmath83 , much higher than the co - added sdss spectrum ( s / n=@xmath84 ) .",
    "we have used the mpfit routine to fit the co - added apo spectrum with the latest ( june 2008 ) version of the koester atmosphere models descrbed in @xcite , adjusted with a first order polynomial .",
    "this spectral fitting has proved a challenging endeavor .",
    "the raw ( unreduced ) @xmath85 parameter has two distinct minima in the @xmath71 , @xmath72 plane : one around @xmath86 k , @xmath87 and one around @xmath88 k , @xmath89 ( see figure [ fig-4 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the hot solutions provide slightly lower @xmath85 values than the cold solutions , but neither fits are very impressive ( see figure [ fig-5 ] for the best - fit cold solution - the visual quality of the best - fit hot solution is similar ) .",
    "this degeneracy between cold and hot spectral solutions is common in da wds , and it can usually be broken by including photometric information @xcite . in the right panel of figure [ fig-4 ]",
    ", we compare the dr7 sdss photometry of sdss 1257 + 5428  ( table [ tab-1 ] ) with the photometric models of @xcite .",
    "the hot solutions can be discarded with a high degree of confidence .",
    "the cold solutions come very close to reproducing the sdss photometry , with the models along the cold @xmath52 minimum being offset from the data by only @xmath90 magnitudes in @xmath91 .",
    "this kind of discrepancy is not uncommon in comparisons between the sdss photometry of da wds and cooling models ( * ? ?",
    "* see also section [ subsubsec : poorfits ] below ) . including the full reddening correction of @xcite changes the @xmath91 color by @xmath92 magnitudes and the @xmath93 color by @xmath94 magnitudes , which reduces the discrepancy by a small amount .",
    "even though it is not exactly at the bottom of the local @xmath85 minimum , we have found that the spectral model with @xmath95 k and @xmath89 ( figure [ fig-5 ] ) provides the best match to the continuum and the cores of the high order balmer lines , which should be more sensitive to the value of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we consider this model our ` best fit ' , although it can not be said that the spectral adjustment shown in figure [ fig-5 ] is particularly good . nevertheless , the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 that we obtain are reasonably close to those found by e06 using the co - added sdss spectrum .",
    "this agreement between different analysis techniques applied to different data sets of the same object is encouraging , and supports our choice of spectral model .",
    "the failure of theoretical models to reproduce the details of the spectrum and photometry of sdss 1257 + 5428  is not entirely unexpected .",
    "even the most updated versions of the koester atmosphere models have problems for wds with @xmath96 k. at these temperatures , the contribution of neutral and charged perturbers to the equation of state is of the same order of magnitude , and the size of the convective envelope of the wd has an abrupt increase @xcite .",
    "these effects have been put forward as possible causes for the observed increase of the average effective gravity for wds in this temperature range @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies shown in figure [ fig-5 ] , however , are rather large , and they should not be written off as shortcomings of the models before considering alternative explanations .",
    "the high s / n of our co - added apo spectrum reveals some unusual features in the continuum around 4600   and 4750  .",
    "the features are not present in the photometric standard feige 67 , which indicates that the flux calibration is not at fault",
    ". none of the calibration frames , flat fields or biases have flaws that could have caused these features .",
    "other wds that we observed with the same spectrograph in the same mode @xcite do not show them , but these are fainter objects with worse s / n in the co - added spectra . at this stage , we have no explanation for the presence of these localized features , but they are clearly not large enough to influence the mismatch between the models and the observed spectrum .",
    "it is possible that the spectrum of sdss 1257 + 5428  is simply distorted by optical emission from its binary companion .",
    "the co - added sdss spectrum shows no traces of line emission or a substantial excess in the red spectrograph , clear signs of the presence of a nondegenerate companion that would have prompted a da+m classification for sdss 1257 + 5428  by e06 ( this is ruled out by the rv curve as well , see the discussion in section [ sec : companion ] ) .",
    "a wd companion is more difficult to discard from the point of view of the spectrum alone .",
    "we have examined the individual apo spectra that are closer to quadrature , when the relative rv shift of the individual components should be larger , but found no sign of artifacts or asymmetries in the balmer lines that might indicate the presence of a second da wd of similar temperature .",
    "a substantially hotter wd of any spectral class would rapidly overwhelm the spectrum of sdss 1257 + 5428 , having a large impact on the sdss photometry shown in figure [ fig-4 ] .",
    "the only possibility left is a non - da wd of similar or lower temperature with a rather featureless spectrum . in figure [ fig-6 ]",
    "we display the spectral energy density ( sed ) of sdss 1257 + 5428 together with the range covered by the models of @xcite .",
    "the seds of models along the cold @xmath52 minimum are roughly consistent with the five - band photometry of sdss 1257 + 5428",
    ". there might be a hint of an excess in the @xmath97 band , but infrared data would be required to confirm this possibility .",
    "on the other hand , all the models seem to overpredict the flux in the @xmath98 band , an effect that was already apparent in the color - color plot shown in figure [ fig-4 ] . since this is a flux deficit instead of an excess , it is hard to explain by invoking the presence of a companion .",
    "in fact , @xcite find similar problems in the @xmath98 band for other cold da wds ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "minimum , @xmath71 between 8000 and 9000 k and @xmath72 between 8.0 and 9.0 ( shaded area ) .",
    "[ fig-6 ] ]    we conclude that the shortcomings of the wd models in this temperature range are indeed the most likely explanation for the poor quality of the spectral fit shown in figure [ fig-5 ] .",
    "a cold wd companion can not be ruled out based on the spectral information alone , but neither is there any evidence in the observations that _ requires _ the presence of such a companion .",
    "we shall revisit this possibility in section [ sec : companion ] .      the issues with the models that we have discussed require that we be extremely careful with the interpretation of the spectral fits .",
    "in particular , we can not justify the calculation of confidence ranges around the fitted parameters in the usual way ( i.e. , based on the @xmath85 statistic ) .",
    "but we are not interested in the confidence ranges around @xmath71 and @xmath72 _ per se_. rather , our goal is to use the spectrum of sdss 1257 + 5428  to measure its mass and constrain the nature of its unseen companion .",
    "an estimate for the mass of sdss 1257 + 5428  can be obtained by examining the performance of the spectral models around the cold minimum in @xmath85 space .",
    "the cooling curves of @xcite included in the models of @xcite give a value of @xmath99 for our best - fit spectral solution , which is probably a good initial guess for the mass of sdss 1257 + 5428 .",
    "along the cold @xmath85 minimum , the spectral solutions with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 k ; and @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 ( indicated by the small blue circles in the left panel of figure [ fig-4 ] ) appear to bracket the effective gravity values that are in best agreement with the higher order balmer lines in the spectrum , as shown in figure [ fig-7 ] . any models with @xmath72 outside this range result in extremely poor fits and must be discarded , including the models with lower @xmath71 and lower @xmath72 that seem to be preferred by the photometry ( right panel of figure [ fig-4 ] ) . since we have already ruled out a da wd companion of similar temperature , we expect the shape of the higher order balmer lines to be a reliable probe of the mass of sdss 1257 + 5428 , even if the underlying continuum is somewhat distorted .    , h@xmath106 , and h@xmath107 ) in the spectrum of sdss 1257 + 5428  and the three models along the cold @xmath85 minimum indicated with small blue circles in the left panel of figure [ fig-4 ] .",
    "although higher order lines ( h@xmath108 and h@xmath73 ) are present in the spectrum , the s / n is too low for a meaningful comparison with the models .",
    "[ fig-7 ] ]    the spectral models shown in figure [ fig-7 ] translate into masses between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which we will adopt as conservative lower and upper limits to @xmath111 .",
    "it is unfortunate that the poor performance of the spectral models in this temperature range does not allow for a more accurate measurement of @xmath111 , but we believe that our estimate is reasonable , and probably the best that can be done with current tools . we note that the models we contemplate here span a range of @xmath72 values around the best - fit solution ( @xmath112 ) that is comfortably larger than the reported increase for @xmath96 k ( @xmath113 , * ? ? ?",

    "also , our lower limit to @xmath111 is close to the mean mass of da wds with @xmath114 k ( @xmath115 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would be the best guess for the mass of a wd in absence of any spectral or photometric information . for all these reasons , we are confident that the true mass of sdss 1257 + 5428  lies within the range of values that we propose here . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the best - fit hot spectral model ( @xmath86 k , @xmath87 ) translates into a value of @xmath116 for @xmath111 . with the set of limiting spectral models around the best - fit cold solution shown in figure [ fig-4 ] , the @xcite curves yield a cooling age of @xmath60 gyr .",
    "the absolute @xmath14 magnitude is @xmath117 , which results in a distance of @xmath118 pc for sdss 1257 + 5428 .",

    "we stress that the properties of the rv curve alone require a massive companion , regardless of the estimated value for @xmath111 : @xmath63 must be more massive than @xmath124 even for @xmath125 ( i.e. , assuming the value of @xmath111 is negligible for the dynamics of the system ) , and more massive than @xmath126 for @xmath127 . with any reasonable range of masses for the primary , a nondegenerate stellar companion would have a spectral type g or earlier , which is clearly incompatible with the observations of sdss 1257 + 5428 .",

    "the range of masses for known nss from @xcite has been highlighted with a shaded region , taking into account the recent re - evaluation of the mass of psr 0751 + 1807 by @xcite .",
    "[ fig-8 ] ]    could the companion be a wd ? we have not been able to discard this possibility from the point of view of the optical spectrum alone , but the properties of the rv curve make it very unlikely . the companion could only be a wd if our mass estimate for @xmath111 was completely off , and even then , it would have to be a very massive object ( above @xmath130 for any reasonable value of @xmath111 ) , cool object , without any prominent absorption lines ( see discussion in section [ subsubsec : poorfits ] ) . such massive wds",
    "are extremely rare .",
    "but we have found no evidence to indicate that the shape of the balmer lines in the spectrum of sdss 1257 + 5428  is distorted in any way , so there is no reason to doubt our conservative estimate for @xmath111 .",

    "considering all the evidence , the most likely possibility by far is that the companion of sdss 1257 + 5428  be the stellar remnant of a supernova explosion , either a ns or a bh .",

    "one interesting implication of the companion of sdss 1257 + 5428  being a ns or bh is that the system should have received some kind of kick from the sn explosion . in principle , the spatial velocity of sdss 1257 + 5428  can be determined by the temporal average of the non - gravitational doppler shifts in the spectrum , which gives the radial component , and the proper motion measured by sdss ( @xmath146 ) , which gives the component on the plane of the sky .",

    "the radial component is more difficult to estimate , because the constant component to the rv curve ( @xmath148 in our fit , see section [ subsec : orbit ] ) is the combination of the true radial velocity and the gravitational redshift of the wd .",
    "the value of the gravitational redshift depends on the wd mass , which we can not measure with accuracy ( see section [ subsec : spectrum ] ) , and the wd radius , which is also model dependent .",
    "a detailed estimate of the gravitational redshift for sdss 1257 + 5428  is outside the scope of this work , but for a massive @xmath149 wd , we expect it to be of the order of @xmath150 @xcite , which would require a radial velocity around @xmath151",
    ". the total spatial velocity would then be @xmath13 , mostly in the radial direction , which is comparable to the measured kicks for pulsars in binary systems @xcite .",
    "regardless of what the nature of the companion to sdss 1257 + 5428  turns out to be , the system is clearly very interesting from an astrophysical point of view , and new observations should yield exciting results in the near future . from the measured orbital parameters ,",
    "the separation of the components must be small , with values of the semimajor axis larger than @xmath152 au only for @xmath153 ( @xmath154 au at @xmath155 ) .",
    "if pulsations from a ns companion were detected , this could allow for a significant measurement of the shapiro delay , as in psr j0437@xmath1564715 @xcite .",
    "the merging time @xmath66 of the sdss 1257 + 5428  system due to gw radiation is @xmath157 myr , with the uncertainty in this upper limit arising from the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath111 .",
    "for the canonical inclination angle @xmath155 , @xmath66 becomes @xmath70 myr .",
    "we note that only three wd+ns binaries with @xmath158 were known previously @xcite , and sdss 1257 + 5428  has a shorter period and @xmath66 than any of them .",
    "the discovery of a fourth object in this class should prompt a revision of the estimated wd+ns merger rates and their expected contribution to the gw background @xcite .",
    "the ultimate fate of sdss 1257 + 5428  is unclear .",
    "@xcite have proposed the merging of massive wds onto nss as a scenario for the origin of long - duration gamma - ray bursts without an accompanying sn like grb 060614 @xcite , but theoretical simulations for the final accretion phase in this kind of events have not been performed yet .",
    "the coalescence of a bh with a massive wd may also lead to a gamma - ray burst @xcite , but the observational signature depends again on the details of the final accretion phase , which are poorly understood .",
    "more exotic astrophysical transients , such as may be observed by present ( ptf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and forthcoming ( e.g. lsst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) synoptic surveys , can not be discarded as outcomes .",
    "in this paper and a companion publication @xcite we have presented the first results from the swarms survey , an ongoing project aimed at discovering and characterizing cwdbs in general and ddwd sn ia progenitors in particular among the wds in the spectroscopic sdss data base .",
    "further results and a complete description of the survey will be the subject of forthcoming publications .",
    "our ultimate goal is to estimate a rate for the merger of ddwd sn ia progenitors in the galaxy , and to use that rate , in combination with the results from spy and other surveys , to assess the viability of the ddwd progenitor scenario for type ia sne .    to demonstrate the capabilities of swarms , we have focused on sdss 1257 + 5428 , the first object found by the survey .",
    "this wd was identified as a member of a binary system from the sdss spectra , and follow - up observations were performed to measure its orbital and spectral parameters .",
    "the rv curve has a period of @xmath47 hr , with a semiamplitude of @xmath159 .",
    "the primary wd is cold ( @xmath160 k ) , which makes the spectral analysis somewhat challenging , but we have derived a conservative estimate of @xmath2 for its mass .",
    "this implies that the unseen companion must be larger than @xmath3 , and is probably a ns or a bh . at a distance of @xmath118 pc",
    ", this would be the closest remnant of a sn explosion to the solar system .",
    "we have discussed the implications of our discovery , and suggested future avenues of research on this object .",
    "this kind of massive , close binary is a perfect example of the objects that can be found by swarms and other similar surveys like muchfuss @xcite .",
    "we anticipate more such discoveries , which we will report in the literature .",
    "we also plan to set up an on - line database of swarms objects .                                                          , r. , et  al . 2004 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
