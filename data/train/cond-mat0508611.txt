    "synchronization is an ubiquitous phenomenon , found in a variety of natural systems like fireflies , where the males flash light in synchrony to attract the females @xcite , chirping crickets @xcite , or like neural systems , but also utilized for artificial systems of information science in order to enable a well - coordinated behavior in time . as an important special case",
    ", the coordinated behavior refers to similar or even identical units like oscillators that are individually characterized by their phases and amplitudes .",
    "a further reduction in the description was proposed by kuramoto for an ensemble of @xmath1 oscillators @xcite , after winfree had started with a first model of coupled oscillators @xcite . within",
    "a perturbative approach kuramoto showed that for any system of weakly coupled and nearly identical limit - cycle oscillators , the long - term dynamics is described by differential equations just for the phases @xmath2 ( not for the amplitudes ) with mutual interactions , depending on the phase differences in a bounded form .",
    "kuramoto solved this model for the special case of all - to - all coupled oscillators , for identical interaction functions , and for eigenfrequencies , taken out of a narrow distribution .",
    "it is , however , this model , later named after him , that nowadays plays the role of a paradigm for weakly and continuously interacting oscillators . in a large number of succeeding publications",
    "the original kuramoto model was generalized in various directions , for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "in particular the eigenfrequencies were specialized in a way that one oscillator plays the role of a pacemaker with eigenfrequency different from zero , while all others have eigenfrequency zero @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the pacemaker was placed at a specific position , the beginning of a linear chain . moreover",
    "the interaction range was changed from all - to - all to next neighbor interactions @xcite@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the system was studied numerically , and an abrupt change from long - to short - term interaction was suggested .",
    "+ in this paper we consider a system of kuramoto oscillators , coupled on various regular lattice topologies , and driven by a pacemaker , placed at an arbitrary site of the lattice .",
    "the interaction range is neither restricted to next - neighbor nor to all - to - all couplings , but varied by a parameter @xmath3 that tunes the decay with the distance between the interacting units .",
    "we analytically derive the common frequency @xmath4 of phase - locked motion and the upper bound on the absolute value of the ratio of the pacemaker s frequency to the coupling strength @xmath5 for next - neighbor and all - to - all couplings in case of @xmath0-dimensional regular lattices with open or closed boundaries , in particular for a ring and an open chain .",
    "the results show the dependence on the size of the system ( total number @xmath1 of oscillators ) , the position @xmath6 of the pacemaker ( for open boundary conditions ) and the ( a)symmetric treatment of the pacemaker s interaction with the other kuramoto oscillators ( tuned by the parameter @xmath7 ) . the intermediate interaction range @xmath8 as well as the phase evolution in the desynchronized phase ( above the threshold for phase - locked motion ) are treated numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the model and identify the various special cases .",
    "section [ sec : phase - locked ] is devoted to the study of phase - locked motion .",
    "we calculate the common frequency and the critical threshold for phase - locked motion for a linear chain and @xmath9 ( section [ sec : linear_chain ] ) , for a ring and @xmath9 in section [ sec : ring ] , the case of all - to - all couplings ( @xmath10 ) in section [ sec : all - to - all ] .",
    "our main result about a switch to synchronization via the closure of a chain is stated in section [ sec : switch_sync ] .",
    "section [ sec : intermediate ] presents our results of numerical simulations for the intermediate interaction range ( @xmath11 ) . in section [ sec : higher_dim ] we generalize the previous results to regular lattice topologies in higher dimensions , i.e. to cayley - trees and d - dimensional hypercubic lattices ) . in section [ sec : above_critical ]",
    "we report on numerical results for the phase portrait above the critical threshold , in the desynchronized phase , in which the phases appear as a superposition of a fast motion , determined by the pacemaker , and a slow motion , determined by the interaction of all other oscillators .",
    "finally we give the summary and conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "details of the analytical calculations are postponed to the appendix .",
    "the system is defined on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , where each site is a limit - cycle oscillator .",
    "the phase of the @xmath12-th oscillator obeys the dynamics determined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 in particular @xmath2 is the phase of the i - th oscillator , the index @xmath6 labels the pacemaker with eigenfrequency @xmath15 , while all other oscillators have eigenfrequency zero .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 serves to tune the interaction of the pacemaker with the other oscillators . for @xmath17",
    "the pacemaker is on the same footing as the other oscillators , being only distinct by its eigenfrequency @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    "its interaction is asymmetric in the sense that the pacemaker influences the other oscillators , but not vice versa ( the pacemaker acts as an external force ) , so that it is on a different level in the hierarchy of the system .",

    "the phases of the i - th and j - th oscillators interact via the sine function ( as originally proposed by kuramoto ) , of which two properties enter the analytical predictions : the sine is bounded and an odd function .",
    "the distance @xmath22 , given in units of the edges of the lattice , enters to the power @xmath23 , @xmath10 gives the space - independent all - to - all coupling , originally considered by kuramoto , @xmath9 is understood to restrict the interactions to nearest neighbors .",
    "the label of the oscillator simultaneously specifies the location in space , see e.g. figure [ fig : linear_chain ] for a one - dimensional chain , where coordinate @xmath6 specifies the position of the pacemaker .",

    "note that the interaction strength is symmetric between oscillators @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , continuous in time and instantaneous .",
    "it depends on the natural or artificial systems that are modelled by kuramoto oscillators , whether these features amount to appropriate idealizations or to an oversimplification .",
    "for example , the interactions between fireflies propagate with the very velocity of light . in view of their mutual distances on the trees",
    "the delay caused by the finite velocity of light should be completely negligible .",
    "when the interaction proceeds via pulses as in neural systems , the continuous interaction [ as in system ( [ def : model ] ) ] is also not adequate .",
    "in this section we consider the conditions for having phase - locked motion , in which the phase differences between any pair of oscillators remain constant over time , after an initial relaxation time .",
    "in general two quantities are of interest for phase - locked motion , the frequency @xmath4 , in common to all oscillators in the phase - locked state , and the critical threshold in terms of the absolute value of the eigenfrequency of the pacemaker @xmath27 over the coupling strength @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 , that gives an upper bound for having phase - locked motion as a stable state .",
    "we analytically calculate ( see the appendix ) @xmath4 for any dimension @xmath0 of the lattice and for arbitrary range of the interaction ( i.e. @xmath30 ) . imposing the phase - locked condition @xmath31 to system ( [ def : model ] ) and using the fact that the sine is an odd function , one easily obtains @xmath32 where the @xmath21s are defined in eq.([def : eta ] ) .",
    "they contain the informations about the range of the interactions and about the topology on which the system is defined ( i.e. @xmath21 is a function of @xmath3 , it depends on the dimension @xmath0 and on the boundary conditions of the lattice ) .",
    "moreover , in case of periodic boundary conditions and in case of long - range interactions ( @xmath10 ) , we find @xmath33 or , in other words , the normalization factor defined in eq.([def : eta ] ) becomes independent on @xmath12 ( i.e. the position on the lattice of the @xmath12-th oscillator ) . in this case",
    "we are able to prove that eq.([eq : common_frequency ] ) takes the explicit form @xmath34    the main result is that eq.([eq : common_frequency_ring ] ) is independent on @xmath3 . moreover , in such cases the position of the pacemaker does not change the behavior of the system .",
    "therefore we dropped the index @xmath6 of the pacemaker in eq.([eq : common_frequency_ring ] ) .",
    "+ as a next step , we calculate the critical threshold @xmath29 for a one - dimensional lattice and different range of interactions : analytically for next - neighbor @xmath35 and for long - range @xmath36 interactions ( section [ sec : linear_chain]-[sec : all - to - all ] ) , numerically for intermediate coupling range ( section [ sec : intermediate ] ) . both quantities ,",
    "the common frequency @xmath4 and the critical threshold @xmath29 , have an analytical generalization to higher dimensions @xmath37 ( section [ sec : higher_dim ] ) .",
    "+ all numerical results ( apart from those of figure [ fig : average_frequency ] ) are obtained with an accuracy of @xmath38 by integrating the system ( [ def : model ] ) by the fourth - order runge - kutta method ( with fixed time step @xmath39 ) .",
    "we consider @xmath40 kuramoto oscillators coupled along a chain as indicated in figure [ fig : linear_chain ] with free boundary conditions at the positions @xmath41 and @xmath1 , and the pacemaker located at position @xmath6 , @xmath42 .",
    "for this simple topology , eq.([def : eta ] ) takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the heaviside step function [ @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "eq.([eq : eta_chain ] ) inserted into eq.([eq : common_frequency ] ) gives the proper value of the common frequency @xmath4 as function of the position @xmath6 and the eigenfrequency @xmath18 of the pacemaker , the size of the system @xmath1 as well as the range of the interaction , parameterized by @xmath3 .",
    "+ to derive the critical frequency of the pacemaker in the case of next - neighbor interactions @xmath35 , we use the odd parity of the sine function .",
    "we derive a recursive relation between the phase differences of next - neighbor oscillators . using the boundary conditions it is possible to express these recursive equations in terms of @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sine function is bounded .",
    "these bounds induce the bound on the maximal pacemaker frequency @xmath29 that is compatible with a phase - locked motion . during the recursions between phase differences we have to distinguish whether we move to the boundary to the right or to the left of the pacemaker @xmath6 , placed between @xmath49 ; either the boundary conditions enter for oscillator @xmath1 or oscillator @xmath41 .",
    "thus if we move to the right , we obtain for the maximal pacemaker s frequency @xmath50 so that all oscillators to the right ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath6 approach a phase - locked state , and @xmath52 as bound for oscillators on the left ( @xmath53 ) of @xmath6 to synchronize in a phase - locked motion .",

    "we can rewrite the system ( [ def : model ] ) according to @xmath75 as we see from eq.s ( [ eq : all - to - all1 ] ) , all oscillators different from the pacemaker satisfy exactly the same equation .",

    "using system ( [ eq : all - to - all1 ] ) and the fact that the sine function is bounded , it is easily seen that the critical ratio @xmath68 is still given by eq.([eq : critic_ring ] ) , valid for the ring and @xmath9 .",

    "it is then the mere closure of the open chain to a ring that leads from non - synchronized to synchronized oscillators with phase - locked motion .",
    "therefore , for a whole range of ratios @xmath5 , no fine - tuning is needed to switch to a synchronized state , but just a simple change in topology .",
    "because of its simplicity we suspect that this mechanism is realized in biological systems that need the possibility of an easy switch between synchronization and desynchronization .",
    "in our numerical integration we simulated such a switch and plot the phase portrait in figure [ fig : switch ] .",
