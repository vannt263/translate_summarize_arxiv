    "it has been suggested in @xcite that the presence of an external potential plays a key role for the convergence of thermal conductivity in the system .",
    "it was conjectured an infinite thermal conductivity for all isolated one - dimensional lattices , where the absence of external potential leads to the conservation of the system total momentum .",
    "this hypothesis was refuted in the papers @xcite , in which it was shown that the isolated chain of coupled rotators ( a chain with a periodic interparticle potential ) has a finite thermal conductivity .",

    "it is claimed in these papers that with a certain degree of interaction asymmetry , the thermal conductivity measured in nonequilibrium conditions converges in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the authors of @xcite attribute the convergence of the thermal conductivity to the uneven thermal expansion of the asymmetric chain . without a doubt , the thermal expansion of the chain itself can not be the reason for the convergence of thermal conductivity , because such expansion is present in the chain with an asymmetric toda potential , which is an integrable system ! modeling of heat transfer in @xcite was performed with the help of nonequilibrium md simulation with the nose - hoover heat baths .",

    "the aim of this work is to simulate the heat transport in molecular chains with asymmetric potentials of the pair inter - particle interaction in the framework of 1 ) nonequilibrium molecular dynamics using langevin thermostat and 2 ) equilibrium dynamics using the green - kubo approach .",
    "it will be shown that the chains with unbounded asymmetric potentials of the pair inter - particle interaction can have finite thermal conductivity .",
    "for instance the chains with the asymmetric pair potentials which allow for bond dissociation ( similar to the lennard - jones and morse potentials ) possess finite thermal conductivity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a chain with a purely repulsive interaction potentials , like the chain with coulomb interaction between nearest neighbors , also has final thermal conductivity .",
    "thermal conductivity convergence in such chains is caused by strong ( anomalous ) rayleigh scattering of long - wave phonons by the fluctuations of local extension at low temperatures , and by many body scattering at high temperatures . on the other hand , the presence of the inter - particle pair interaction which limits such fluctuations and prevents the transformation of the 1d lattice into a 1d gas of colliding particles , results in anomalous ( diverging with the system size ) thermal conductivity of the 1d chain .",
    "hence the chains with the fpu potential , either symmetric or asymmetric , and the chains with any combined pair potential which includes the parabolic confining potential , have infinite thermal conductivity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the reason is that such chains do not allow for the bond dissociation or rupture . from our studies",
    "we can conclude that the thermal transport of a one - dimensional chain will be anomalous break if the asymmetric potential of the inter - particle pair interaction grows not slower than the square of the relative distance .",

    "deformation of the valence and torsion angles is described by the limited angular periodic potentials .",
