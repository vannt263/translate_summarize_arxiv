    "torsion pairs in abelian categories were introduced by dickson  @xcite ( see the introduction to  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "they play an important role in the study of localisation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and in tilting theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "also , torsion pairs in the case of triangulated categories , as defined in  @xcite , have been considered recently by a number of authors , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the main object of study of this article is the collection of torsion pairs in a tube category , which is a hereditary abelian category .",
    "such categories arise as full subcategories of module categories over tame hereditary algebras , and are so - called because their auslander - reiten quivers have the shape of a tube .",
    "a geometric model for tube categories has been given in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the indecomposable objects are parametrized by a collection of oriented arcs in an annulus with @xmath0 marked points on one of its boundary components .",
    "the dimension of the @xmath1-group between two indecomposable objects coincides with the negative intersection number of the corresponding pair of arcs .    in this article",
    ", we classify the torsion pairs in a tube category @xmath2 .",
    "we build on results in  @xcite giving a bijection between torsion pairs in a tube category and cotilting objects in the category obtained by taking arbitrary direct limits of modules in the tube .",
    "we show that all torsion pairs in the tube category arise in this way or via a dual construction .",
    "thus they are in bijection with maximal rigid objects in the category @xmath3 obtained from the tube by taking arbitrary direct or inverse limits of objects in the tube .",
    "we give an explicit description of this bijection and its inverse .",
    "we further show that the geometric model referred to above can be extended to the indecomposable objects in @xmath3 , i.e.  to include prfer and adic modules associated to the tube .",
    "these extra objects are represented by certain infinite arcs in the annulus which spiral in towards the inner boundary component .",
    "the result concerning the dimensions of @xmath1-groups extends to this case also .",
    "this enables us to give a characterisation of maximal rigid objects in @xmath2 in the geometric model .",
    "we also give a characterisation of torsion pairs in the geometric model in terms of certain closure properties corresponding to closure properties of the subcategories in a torsion pair .",
    "in particular , the collection of arcs corresponding to a subcategory in a torsion pair must form an _ oriented ptolemy diagram _",
    ", an oriented version in the annulus case of the ptolemy diagrams appearing in  @xcite , as well as satisfying additional criteria .",
    "we also give a geometric description of the above bijection and its inverse .    in order to give the geometric interpretation",
    ", we first give a similar model for the linearly oriented quiver in type a ( note that m. warkentin  @xcite also suggests such a model ) and show how to interpret tilting modules and torsion pairs in this model .",
    "we remark that , in independent work , t. holm , p. jrgensen and m. rubey  @xcite have classified the torsion pairs in the cluster category associated to a tube ( as opposed to the tube itself , which we study here ) .",
    "the torsion pairs in the cluster case are different , although we note that unoriented ptolemy diagrams play a role in the cluster tube case , while oriented ptolemy diagrams appear here .    in section 1 ,",
    "we recall the definition and some of the properties of torsion pairs in abelian categories . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the type a case . in section 3",
    ", we recall the geometric model of the tube and show how it can be extended to include prfer and adic modules .",
    "we also discuss a certain reflection map ( from  @xcite ) on the indecomposable objects of the tube , and its properties . in section 4",
    "we classify the torsion pairs in the tube and prove that they are in bijection with maximal rigid objects in @xmath3 , giving an explicit description of the bijection and its inverse . in section 5 , we give a geometric interpretation of maximal rigid objects in @xmath2 and torsion pairs in @xmath2 and the bijection between them .",
