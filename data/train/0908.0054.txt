    "one of the most precise cosmological observations is the measurement of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the experimental data are useful for probing the dynamics and properties of many theoretical cosmological models . nowadays",
    ", the most successful model describing the observed profiles of cmb anisotropies is the so called , cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath1cdm ) . nevertheless , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has some inconsistencies with the observations on galactic and sub - galactic scales .",
    "for instance , cdm predicts cusp central density profiles of dark halos in low surface brightness ( lsb ) and dwarf galaxies ; meanwhile the measurements indicate a smooth distribution of matter . also , cdm has some discrepancies between the number of predicted satellite galaxies in high - resolution n - body simulations and observations . in this sense ,",
    "the possibility of alternative hypothesis on the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is open .    in recent years",
    ", it has been argued that a real scalar field @xmath2 , minimally coupled to gravity , could be a plausible candidate for dark matter ( dm ) . this alternative proposal ( or similar ideas )",
    "is called scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) @xcite .",
    "several previous works have shown that a scalar field is able to reproduce the cosmological evolution of the universe . to this end , the scalar field",
    "is endowed with a scalar potential @xmath3 of the form @xmath4 or @xmath5 and obeys an equation of state @xmath6 that varies in time ( @xmath7 ) ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that sfdm model predicts a supression on the mass power spectrum for small scales .",
    "thus , sfdm could help to explain the excess of satellite galaxies .",
    "the sfdm paradigm has also been tested on galactic scales , showing interesting results .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the density profiles for sfdm halos are non cuspy profiles , in accordance with the observations of lsb galaxies ( see also * ? ? ? * matos et al .",
    "moreover , it is noticeable that in the relativistic regime , scalar fields can form gravitationally bounded structures .",
    "these are called boson stars for complex scalar fields @xcite and oscillatons for real scalar fields @xcite .",
    "there are also scalar field stable gravitational structures described by the schrdinger - poisson system @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising and physically interesting feature of sfdm resides on the hypothesis that it describes cosmological bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for that reason it is important to provide a thermodynamic understanding of scalar particles , putting aside for the moment the classical field description .    in the sfdm model ,",
    "the mass is constrained by phenomenology to an extremely low value ( @xmath8ev ) .",
    "this ultralight scalar field mass fits the observed amount of substructure @xcite , the critical mass of galaxies @xcite , the rotation curves of galaxies @xcite , the central density profile of lsb galaxies @xcite , the evolution of the cosmological densities @xcite , etc . furthermore , sfdm forms galaxies earlier as cdm",
    "; thus , if sfdm is correct , we expect to see big galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "if this scalar field could be considered as a system of individual light bosonic particles ( with zero spin ) and , moreover , if there are some of these scalar particles in thermal equilibrium forming an ideal gas , then they should obey the bose - einstein statistics . from this perspective ,",
    "ultralight bosonic dark matter ( ulbdm ) seems to have some properties close to those of neutrinos .",
    "in fact , neutrinos constitute a subdominant component of dm in the universe . for this reason ,",
    "it is interesting to mention some of the most remarkable features of the neutrino cosmology .    at very early times of the universe ,",
    "the neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with the primeval fireball ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "due to its low mass compared with its temperature in this epoch , they behaved exactly as radiation at the moment of its decoupling .",
    "this means that neutrinos fall on the classification of hot dark matter ( hdm ) . after decoupling",
    ", neutrinos still keep the relativistic distribution , while they relax only with the expansion of the universe ; this is called the _ freeze - out_. thus , the temperature of neutrinos evolves simply as @xmath9 and eventually could reduce to lower values than the mass .",
    "this epoch is known as the _ nonrelativistic transition _ ( nrt ) of the neutrino . since this epoch",
    ", gravitational attraction is sufficient to contribute to structure formation . once decoupled and after electron - positron annihilations , the temperature of neutrinos remains well determined in terms of the temperature of the photons as @xmath10 ; this fixes the neutrino number density today at @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "it is now clear that if nrt occurs earlier , then neutrinos can form more bounded structures and vice versa .",
    "however , in most of the typical scenarios , this transition occurs too late , thus making the neutrino contribution subdominant ( see an excellent review in * ? ? ?",
    "neutrinos and ulbdm are similar in that they are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium but with negligible couplings with other types of matter .",
    "the value of the mass also ensures that both decouple when still relativistic and also that their distribution freezes - out .",
    "they differ , however , in many aspects ; an important intrinsic part of the nature of the neutrino is that it is a fermion and therefore its density has an upper bound .",
    "thus , the content of neutrinos @xmath13 is entirely parameterized by its mass , i.e. , @xmath14 ev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of ulbdm , the mass and abundance are not correlated .",
    "another difference is that couplings of neutrinos are well known from weak interactions and their thermal decoupling is predicted at @xmath15 mev .",
    "however , in the case of ulbdm the energy scale of interactions are unknown , we shall then assume that decoupling occurs well before neutrino decoupling and that the temperature @xmath16 is as a free parameter .    in the present work , inspired by the neutrino cosmology and the sfdm model",
    ", we assume that the universe contains two components of dm , that is , ulbdm and standard cdm .",
    "we focus on the question of whether the dominant contribution of ulbdm to matter at present epoch could mimic the effects of cdm on the cmb spectrum of anisotropies .",
    "of course , there is important previous research in this context .",
    "for example , @xcite treat an _ ultra - light pseudo - goldstone boson _ @xmath17 as part of dm and use cmb data to constrain the density fraction @xmath18 .",
    "this provides a simple and very useful description of _ free streaming _ effects . in the context of that work ,",
    "if ulbdm is assumed to be thermalized , the sound speed is @xmath19 defined under the condition of nrt , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "another very interesting approach was done by @xcite , who analyzed the effects of couplings between baryons and scalar mediatior particles .",
    "in fact , scalar particles in a bec serves as a thermal bath for baryons until a time close to recombination epoch .",
    "one of the most important consequences of these interactions is a modification in the expression for the speed of sound , which in turns shifts the position of the acoustic peaks in the cmb .",
    "we stress that in our treatment , ulbdm has a phase - space description , prescribed by the relativistic kinetic theory , i.e. , the evolution of ulbdm is dictated by the boltzmann equation coupled to einstein equations .",
    "this is a novel approach to the paradigm of scalar dm paradigm .",
    "concretely , the object of treatment in our scheme is neither a classical nor quantum field , but rather the phase - space distribution function of an ideal gas of individual noninteracting particles .",
    "the scalar particles are thought to be initially thermalized but decoupled from rest of universe .",
    "even if _ a priori _ we do not restrict ourselves to the case in which all the particles reside in a coherent phase , it is found that bose - einstein condensation has a central role in the model .",
    "the bec formation is assumed to take place before its decoupling during the radiation epoch .",
    "the motivation to work in this scheme is to explore the contribution to the cmb anisotropies from possible thermal particles filling different energy states in the ulbdm gas .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the name ulbdm rather than sfdm ismore descriptive in this approach .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a flat , homogenous and isotropic universe .",
    "we take as fixed parameters the current temperature of the cmb photons t@xmath21k , the current hubble s constant h@xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , and the current baryon density parameter @xmath24 . also , we assume , just for simplicity , that the dark energy in the universe is a cosmological constant @xmath1 with a current density value @xmath25 .",
    "we choose units in which @xmath26 , then , @xmath27k @xmath28ev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ulbdm ] states the key equations of this calculation .",
    "first , we discuss the bose - einstein statistics and some concepts of interest , followed by a brief description of kinetic theory applied to cosmology .",
    "the physical implications of ulbdm in the cmb anisotropies spectrum are discussed in section [ sec : testcmb ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusiones ] .",
    "all the analysis was done using the public code cmbfast @xcite .",
    "the calculated curves were compared to the five year _ wmap _",
    "satellite data @xcite .",
    "( it is available at http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current )",
    "as stated in the introduction , we want to explore the hypothesis of the existence of a kind of dm in the universe composed by scalar particles with an extremely low mass @xmath29 ev .",
    "we assume that ulbdm was in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with the primeval fireball at least in some very early stage of the universe .",
    "accordingly , it can be defined a temperature @xmath16 of the ulbdm , and the dynamics of these particles may be described by the bose - einstein statistics with a phase - space distribution function @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( @xmath32 in the case of scalar particles ) and @xmath33 is the chemical potential .",
    "one immediately finds the condition @xmath34 in order to keep the positive value of the distribution function .",
    "in fact , bose - einstein condensation occurs when the value of the chemical potential approaches the mass of particles .",
    "this phenomenom appears for temperatures below a critical value named _ the critical temperature of condensation _",
    "@xmath35 and consists in a considerable occupation of the state of minimal energy .",
    "we can calculate the number density @xmath36 of particles from the relativistic kinetic theory of gases ( rkt ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy of each individual particle .",
    "it is natural to assume that the mass - to - temperature ratio was very small at the moment of decoupling of ulbdm ; thus , we can solve the integral by taking the ultrarelativistic limit ( @xmath39 ) which yields , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , the riemann function .",
    "the critical temperature in the ultrarelativistic regime is then defined as @xmath42 in this equation , @xmath43 is the total number density of particles per unit volume ; for @xmath44 , @xmath43 is just @xmath36 .",
    "quantum statistical mechanics predicts that the occupation of the lower energy state rapidly increases when the temperature of the bose gas falls below @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the total number density is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the particle number density of the bec .",
    "we can say that ulbdm falls in the classification of hdm , in the sense that it behaves as radiation at its decoupling epoch . after this moment",
    ", @xmath47 is said to be frozen - out until today .",
    "it means that the particles mantain their relativistic distribution with a temperature scaling as @xmath48 .",
    "however , relativistic behaviour does not necessarily prevent the bec formation , ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , because of the expansion of universe , ulbdm cools down and the temperature could be under the value necessary for a nrt .",
    "we want to investigate if this could happen and at times early enough to form large - scale structure .",
    "the free evolution of ulbdm is described by the vlasov equation , also called the liouville or collisionless boltzmann equation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the geometry of the universe is described by the flrw metric with scale factor @xmath49 , perturbed to first order .",
    "ulbdm particles can just move along geodesics and the vlasov equation translates this to a differential equation for the phase - space distribution function @xmath50 of the ulbdm gas . in the conformal newtonian gauge ,",
    "the perturbed metric reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the proper time , and @xmath53 and @xmath17 are the scalar modes of the perturbation . in this gauge , the tensor and vector degrees of freedom are eliminated from the begining .",
    "following the same formalism developed for the fermionic sector ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is useful to define the _ corrected proper momentum _",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is its direction unit vector . the proper momentum @xmath57 is defined in terms of the canonical conjugate momentum @xmath58 of the the comoving coordinate @xmath59 .",
    "the comoving proper energy is given by @xmath60 .",
    "due to the perturbed geometry , we shall consider small deviations from lte : @xmath61 , \\label{f}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the homogenous phase - space distribution function in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath62 @xmath63 is related to the temperature @xmath16 of the ulbdm and its perturbation @xmath64 in the following way : @xmath65 equation ( [ f ] ) can be interpreted as a linear statistical perturbation induced by linear metric perturbations . in fourier space",
    ", the vlasov equation @xmath66 reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the wave number of the fourier mode .",
    "note that the dependence on the direction vector @xmath56 arises only through @xmath69 .",
    "this last equation gives the response of the phase - space distribution function to the metric perturbations .",
    "the natural way to proceed now is to expand the perturbation term @xmath63 in a legendre series : @xmath70 where the @xmath71 are the legendre polynomials whose argument is the angle subtended between the wave number vector and the direction vector .",
    "the problem turns in solving a hierarchical system of boltzmann differential equations for the many coefficients @xmath72 of the legendre expansion , called the multipole moments .",
    "this boltzmann hierarchy can be solved in any boltzmann code together with the boltzmann equations of the rest of matter of the universe . in the following section",
    ", we analyze the cmb spectrum resulting from assuming different contents of cdm and ulbdm .",
    "we carry out our numerical computations with a modified version of the public code cmbfast .",
    "the first question is whether the cmb is effectively sensitive to the nature of the statistics of the ulbdm .",
    "we define the mass - to - temperature ratio of ulbdm as @xmath73 evaluated today , with a similar definition for the mass - to - temperature ratio of some species of fermions as @xmath74 .",
    "we compute the cmb spectra for fermions and bosons separetely .",
    "all the parameters are mantained fixed in order to observe only the effect of the change of the statistics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuvsbos ] , we show that for bosons the amplitudes of the first and second peaks are reduced ; the third peak is increased with respect to the corresponding one for fermions .",
    "we find that for this particular set of parameters , the response of thecmbto the change of statistics is small albeit perceptible ; we will discuss more about this behavior below .",
    "we recall that once ulbdm decoupled , its phase - space distribution function is freezed - out and its temperature can only relax with the expansion of the universe as @xmath48 .",
    "after photon decoupling and in a manner quite similar to neutrinos , the temperature of the ulbdm can be just proportional to that of photons : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a constant free parameter to be determined and is only a measurement of the kinetic energy of ulbdm particles .",
    "the radiation behaviour is defined when most of the particles in the gas are ultrarelativistic ; this happens in the limit @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "correspondingly , the dust behaviour occurs in the limit @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that if the temperature is close to that of photons , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , this means that ulbdm should be still ultra relativistic today .",
    "the effect of ulbdm on the total matter background with this value of @xmath83 moves the entire cmb spectrum to the right and upward ; this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfas ] . for all values @xmath84 computation of the power spectrum results in non - sensitivity to the change of @xmath76 .",
    "it is found then that the radiation behaviour is mantained for @xmath85 . in all the following figures",
    "the crosses form the curve of the mean value of the observed cmb spectrum .    also in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfas ] , we show the prediction for @xmath86 ( third curve ) . in this case , ulbdm becomes non - relativistic very early , causing a damping of the acoustic oscillations because of an increase in gravitational potential wells . at the bottom of the same figure also appears the curve for @xmath87 , in which the same effect is enhanced .",
    "the plot shows that the order of magnitude needed to fit the data is @xmath88 ; this means that the mass of ulbdm must be five orders of magnitude greater than its temperature at the present epoch ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "of course , this is a rough estimation of @xmath76 appropriate for the case in which ulbdm is the dominant component of dm today .",
    "the sensitivity of the cmb power spectrum to small changes of this @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] .",
    "the range shown is from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ( from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is noted that the first and second peaks are enhanced if the ulbdm is more relativistic .",
    "the above rough constraint on @xmath76 depends of course on the relative fractions of ulbdm and cdm .",
    "nevertheless , quite different values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 would modify @xmath76 less than one order of magnitude .",
    "we then use a value of @xmath76 pertinent for ulbdm to be dominant .",
    "we now investigate the content of ulbdm against the content of cdm in two limiting cases .",
    "one is dm dominated by ulbdm with an adequately low content of cdm and the other is the opposite case .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] shows how the increase in cdm diminishes the amplitude of oscillations .",
    "this is an effect of an enhancement of gravitational potential wells of non - relativistic matter .",
    "we must also consider the effect of the fraction of reionized baryonic matter .",
    "we fix all the parameters and then we vary the reionization optical depth @xmath96 , we show in fig . [",
    "fig : reion ] the values between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is found that a universe ulbdm - dominated ( @xmath99 ) seems to be allowed for @xmath89 and @xmath96 about @xmath100 - @xmath101 .",
    "the constraints of @xmath96 from 5yr - wmap data for @xmath1-cdm parameters shows a range between @xmath97 - @xmath102 ( @xmath103% ) @xcite .",
    "we thus find that the mean value of our prediction @xmath104 is well within the range of the standard prediction .",
    "let us now return to the curves shown in fig [ fig : nuvsbos ] .",
    "note again the reduction of the first and second peaks plus the increase of the third peak in the cmb spectrum of the bosons compared to that of fermions .",
    "notice that this effect is quite similar to the increase of non - relativistic matter .",
    "though small , it is a clear manifestation of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "as is known , the energy density of bose particles is greater than that of _ fermi _ particles .",
    "this thus yields to an additional effective damping force on the acoustic oscillations , analogous to the gravitational potential wells of the non - relativistic dm .",
    "we now turn to interprete the thermodynamic variables .",
    "we have found that the low mass - to - temperature ratio @xmath83 necessary to be the dominant component of dm today enables us to take the the non - relativistic relationship : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the critical density of the universe . as we have fixed the mass of ulbdm ( @xmath107 ev )",
    ", the content of ulbdm @xmath94 determines its number density @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath108 it follows that @xmath109 @xmath12 .",
    "such a large density would seem odd in the case of fermions ( for example neutrinos ) because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "nevertheless for ulbdm , its bosonic nature does not restrict the density of particles . with this value of @xmath43 and equation ( [ tempcrit ] ) ,",
    "the estimation of the critical temperature is @xmath110 ev . from the value of @xmath111 , or equivalently @xmath112 ev , we find that the condition @xmath113 is much fulfilled .",
    "this ensures that under the conditions to conform the dominant component of dm , ulbdm shall necessarily be found in a bec state today .",
    "the explicit process of bose - einstein condensation during the evolution of the universe is necessary to understand the nature and behaviour of ulbdm .",
    "this suggests that the assumption of some kind of interactions is necessary in order to study phase transitions from a nondegenerate state to an almost completely degenerate bec .",
    "it is noteworthy that our model curves bring important , mostly qualitative , information . in order to provide completely conclusive results respect to the the ability of ulbdm to match the data , it is necessary to perform further quantitative analyses .",
    "a universe dominated by ulbdm with mass @xmath114 ev could be possible only if today the number density is of the order of @xmath115 @xmath12 , which implies a critical temperature of condensation @xmath35 about @xmath116 ev .",
    "another condition is that the mass - to - temperature ratio @xmath83 should be found to be about @xmath117 , equivalent to a temperature of the order of @xmath118 ev today .",
    "these values indicate that under the above conditions , ulbdm is present in a bose - einstein condensate state",
    ". then , we can conclude that ulbdm endowed with an appropiate bec could mimic the effects of the standard cdm model on the cmb spectrum .",
    "this value of the temperature might be falsified with more direct information about ( thermally efficient ) interactions with other particles .",
    "the energy of interaction should reveal the temperature of decoupling ; the cmb data might then provide information about coupling constants .",
    "we have shown that changing the type of statistics in the distribution function has non negligible effects on the cmb . even if not surprising , it is interesting that the statistical nature of these two kinds of particles is perceptible in the cmb spectrum .",
    "the effect is analogous to the addition of non - relativistic matter .",
    "we find that the effect of reionization is necessary to reach concordance between the ulbdm model and 5yr - wmap data .",
    "we do not find a substantial difference from the usual cdm prediction .",
    "our mean predicted value @xmath119 is well inside the standard prediction ( @xmath103% ) .",
    "this work might be extensible to other massive bose gases by means of the value of the relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath31 , of the particle ( for scalars @xmath32 , massive photons @xmath120 , etc . )",
    "; of course , interactions should make the picture entirely different .",
    "however , we restrict our discussion only to scalars in this paper because a plausible intrinsic nature between sfdm and cosmological becs is found in the literature .",
    "the next natural question is how the process of bec formation should happen , specifically the phase transition from a relativistic , nondegenerate gas to a coherent classical state on the cosmological scales .",
    "this process is expected to imply non - trivial interactions before decoupling in the radiation epoch @xcite . however , this is out of the scope of the present paper and for that reason it is left for a future work .",
    "we finally mention that the present work is an initial analysis where we have explored only the response of the cmb to ulbdm .",
    "it is necessary to implement a precise quantitative analysis to the fits of all the parameters involved in the model by using independent sets of data from other observations .",
