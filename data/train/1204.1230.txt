    "the mixing between different quarks is described by an unitary matrix in the charged current interaction of w - boson in the mass eigen - state of quarks , the cabibbo  @xcite - kobayashi - maskawa  @xcite(ckm ) matrix @xmath3 , defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for n - generations",
    ", @xmath7 is an @xmath8 unitary matrix . with three generations , one can write @xmath9    a commonly used parametrization for mixing matrix with three generations of quark is given by  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 being angles rotating in flavor space and @xmath14 is the cp violating phase .",
    "we refer this as the pdg parametrization .",
    "there are a lot of experimental data on the mixing pattern of quarks .",
    "fitting available data , the mixing angles and cp violating phase are determined to be  @xcite @xmath15    from the above , we obtain the magnitude of the matrix elements as @xmath16    the angles can be viewed as rotations in flavor spaces . but both the angles and the phase in the ckm matrix are not directly measurable quantities .",
    "there are different ways to parameterize the mixing matrix . in different parametrizations ,",
    "the angles and phase are different .",
    "to illustrate this point let us study the original km parametrization  @xcite , @xmath17 using the observed values for the mixing matrix , one would obtain @xmath18 and the central value of the cp violating phase angle is @xmath19 .",
    "we see that the angles and phases in the pdg and km parameterizations are indeed very different .",
    "the angles and phase are parametrization dependent .",
    "it is interesting to see whether all quantities used to parameterize the mixing matrix can all have well defined physical meanings , that is , all are experimentally measurable quantities , as have been done for several other quantities related to mixing matrices  @xcite . to this end",
    "we notice that the magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements are already experimentally measurable quantities , one can take them to parameterize the mixing matrix",
    ". however , the information on cp violation is then hid in the matrix elements , a single magnitude of an element would not be able to be taken as the measure of cp violation .",
    "only a combination of several magnitude is able to signify the cp violation .",
    "for example , @xmath20 @xcite  is non - zero .",
    "experimentally there are several measurable phases which can signify cp violations .",
    "the famous ones are the angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the unitarity triangle defined by the unitarity condition @xmath21 in the complex plane , the above defines a triangle shown in fig 1 .",
    "this triangle defines three phase angles @xmath22    cp violation dictates that the area of this triangle to be non - zero .",
    "this implies that none of the angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be zero . experimentally these three angles have been measured directly  @xcite , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with that obtained using the numerical numbers in eq .",
    "[ qangle ] , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "also the directly measured numbers are consistent with the sm prediction @xmath29 .",
    "notice that the values @xmath0 , @xmath2 are very close to the two phases @xmath30 , @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we will see later that although they are close to each other , they are not exactly equal .",
    "since we know that one only needs one quantity to signify the existence of cp violation , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 must be related .",
    "in fact they are related to the parameter @xmath31 as  @xcite @xmath32 the above is twice of the triangle area in fig 1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 .    to have a parametrization for @xmath35 in which all quantities are experimentally measurable ones",
    ", one can choose three modulus of @xmath36 and one of the above cp violating parameters .",
    "for the cp violating phase , it is clear that the three phase angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are among the simplest and have clear geometric meaning .",
    "we refer these as the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameterizations . in the following",
    "we discuss how the parametrization can be constructed and how they can be transformed from each other .",
    "in the @xmath0 parametrization we take @xmath0 as the phase appearing in the ckm matrix along with three modulus of @xmath37 . from the definition of @xmath0 in eq.[phases ] , we can have four ways in which only one of the @xmath38 relevant to the definition of @xmath0 is complex and all others are real and positive , @xmath39 in the above one can change the signs of the elements by defining quark phases .    indicating the ckm matrix for the four cases by @xmath40 .",
    "we have @xmath41 one can take @xmath0 ,  @xmath42 ,  @xmath43 ,  @xmath44  as the four independent variables to parameterize the ckm matrix .",
    "the other elements can be expressed as functions of them with @xmath45    for the other three cases , @xmath35 are given by @xmath46    similar to case @xmath47 , one can choose the phase @xmath0 and three modulus of @xmath37 as independent variables for the above three cases .",
    "it is convenient to choose the parameter sets ( @xmath0 ,  @xmath43 ,  @xmath48 ,  @xmath49 ) , ( @xmath0 ,  @xmath50 ,  @xmath44 ,  @xmath51 ) and ( @xmath0 ,  @xmath49 ,  @xmath52 ,  @xmath50 ) as independent variables for the above three cases , respectively .    in all the above four cases ,",
    "the jarlskog parameter @xmath31 is given by @xmath53 this is not surprising because the above four cases are equivalent .    to see the above four cases discussed",
    "are equivalent explicitly , let us demonstrate how one can transform case @xmath47 to case @xmath54 by redefining quark phases .",
    "the different parameterizations are equivalent implies that by redefining quark phases , one can transform the different ways of parameterizations for @xmath55 from one to another , that is , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 stand for various types of parametrization .",
    "for example , transforming case @xmath47 to case @xmath54 becomes a mission of finding the different parameters such that + @xmath59 comparing the coefficients , one obtains @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62}\\over{2|v_{ud}||v_{ub}||v_{cd}||v_{cb}|}}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the transformation from case @xmath47 to case @xmath54 is achieved by , @xmath63    similarly one can transform the other two cases to case @xmath54 too .",
    "we now discuss the @xmath1 parametrization . from eq.[phases ] , we can have four choices for the location of the phase similar to the @xmath0 parametrization .",
    "they are @xmath64    in a similar way as for the four cases of @xmath65 , one can show that the above four cases are equivalent .",
    "detailed expressions for these four cases are given in the appendix .",
    "we will display the explicit form for case @xmath66 .",
    "we have @xmath67 for this case it is convenient to take @xmath1 ,  @xmath68 ,  @xmath49 ,  @xmath52 as independent variables .",
    "the other quantities can be expressed as @xmath69 the jarlskog parameter @xmath31 is given by @xmath70    for @xmath2 parametrization , the four different cases are defined by @xmath71    the detailed expressions for these four cases are given in appendix .",
    "we display the explicit form for case @xmath72 here .",
    "we have @xmath73 taking  @xmath2 ,  @xmath44 ,  @xmath68 ,  @xmath51  as variables , the other quantities can be expressed as @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "we now show that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameterizations can also be transformed from each other .",
    "the twelve parameterizations discussed before in the previous section are all equivalent .",
    "we have already shown that the four parameterizations for @xmath0 or @xmath1 or @xmath2 are equivalent ones , we will therefore only need to show that one of the @xmath0 parameterizations is equivalent to one of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 parameterizations .",
    "we now show that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for these two parametrizations , the first column and the third row are already identical in these two parameterizations . using @xmath78",
    "one can readily show that the 12 , 13 , 22 and 23 entries of @xmath79 and @xmath77 are equal .",
    "therefore @xmath80    similarly , using @xmath81    we therefore have shown explicitly that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameterizations are related and can be transformed from one to another .",
    "numerically , one finds that the approximate relations @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "these can be understood easily by noticing the relations between them  @xcite , @xmath84 therefore , @xmath85 is approximately @xmath86 , since @xmath0 is close to @xmath87 , @xmath30 must also be close to @xmath87 and therefore @xmath82 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath14 is approximately equal to @xmath2 .",
    "one may wonder if there is a parametrization where the phase is close to @xmath1 .",
    "we find indeed there are angle prametrizations in which the cp violating phase is close to @xmath1 .",
    "an example is provided by the parametrization @xmath88 discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath89 we have @xmath90    one may also wonder if one can find a parametrization in which the cp violating angle is one of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the other three quantities to parameterize the mixing matrix can be chosen to be three angles similar to those in the pdg or km paramerizations .",
    "we find that this is impossible .",
    "it has been shown that there are nine different ways to parameterize the mixing matrix using one phase and three angles  @xcite .",
    "explicit inspections find that none of the phases can be exactly , allowing sign differences or plus or minus a @xmath86 , identified as one of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parametrization we have introduced , one needs one of the elements in mixing matrix to be of the form @xmath91 , @xmath92 , or @xmath93 , and also another five real matrix elements which can not be satisfied with only three angles .",
    "it has proven to be convenient to use approximate formula such as the wolfenstein parametrization@xcite . in the literature different approximate forms",
    "have been proposed@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the wolfenstein - like expansions in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameterizations demanding to use one of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as one of the parameters .    for the @xmath94 cases ,",
    "we find it convenient to work with @xmath95 case .",
    "we use @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath0 as parameters .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are determined to be @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "to order @xmath105 , we have @xmath106    one can further rotate the phase of c - quark by @xmath86 and b - quark by @xmath107 to obtain an expression where the diagonal entries are close to 1 .",
    "we obtain @xmath108 the above expansion is equivalent to that discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 in ref.@xcite are related to the above parameters by , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . at more than @xmath105 order , there are differences for our approximation and that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath115 cases",
    ", it is convenient to use @xmath116 for expansion . setting @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 with @xmath120 , and @xmath121 @xmath122 . rotating the b - quark field by a phase @xmath123",
    ", we obtain to order @xmath105",
    "@xmath124    for the @xmath125 cases ,",
    "@xmath126 case is convenient for expansion . setting @xmath117 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath122 .",
    "rotating d - quark by a phase @xmath86 and u - quark by a phase @xmath131 , we obtain to order @xmath105 @xmath132    to @xmath105 order , the above expansion is equivalent to the wolfenstein parametrization@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the wolfenstein parametrization are related to @xmath100 , @xmath136 and @xmath2 by @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "again at more than @xmath105 order , there are differences in these two approximations .    among the three phase angles , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the best measured one is @xmath1 .",
    "this makes the approximate expression @xmath140 better than others .",
    "to conclude , we have proposed new parametrizations of the ckm matrix using the three measurable phase angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the unitarity triangle as the cp violating phase . for each of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parametrization",
    "there are four ways to parameterize the mixing matrix where one column and one row elements are all real .",
    "we have shown explicitly that all these cases are equivalent .",
    "we have studied relations of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parametrizations with the usual three rotation angles in flavor space and one cp violating phase parametrizations .",
    "we find that it is not possible to parameterize the ckm matrix using three angles and taking one of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the cp violating phase",
    ". however , there are rotation angle parametrizations in which the cp violating are very close to one of the phase angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 . we , however , emphasis that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parametrizations we proposed have the advantage that all the elements used to describe the mixing matrix are physically measurable quantities , unlike the parametrizations of using rotation angles in flavor space and a phase whose values are parametrization dependent .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parametrizations are parametrization independent representation of the ckm matrix .",
    "we also suggest new wolfenstein - like paramterizations .",
