    "cold atom traps offer intriguing advantages for studying strong interaction physics in quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "we focus on the cold atom prospect for conducting strongly coupled polaron studies .",
    "the polarons we consider are neutral atoms ( referred to as impurity atoms  in this paper ) distinguishable from the bec atoms , i.e. , atoms in a different spin state or atoms of a different species embedded in a large dilute gas bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "the bec polaron is the impurity atom accompanied by its phonon cloud created by the interaction of the impurity with the bec atoms . by varying an external magnetic field near a specific feshbach resonant value",
    "@xcite experimentalists can tune the strength of the impurity - boson interactions and bring the polaron into the strongly coupled regime . in that regime ,",
    "the bec - polaron self - localizes @xcite : the ground state properties become consistent with an impurity wavefunction of finite extent .",
    "the recently demonstrated species - specific potentials ( e.g. the impurity atoms ) , such as laser generated potentials experienced by one kind of atoms @xcite , provides unparalleled prospects for the manipulation of such polaron objects .",
    "attractive impurity - boson interactions give a collapsed ground state in 2d and 3d @xcite .",
    "the cold atom realization of self - localized polarons with repulsive impurity - boson interactions can demonstrate polaron physics in regimes that are difficult to access in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "such cold atom experiments can then address fundamental questions pertaining to the nature of self - localization , the description of heavy polarons with a mass that is comparable to the energy scale of the boson modes and the many - body structure of systems with many polarons .",
    "at sufficiently low temperatures and sufficiently high polaron densities , cold atom traps may realize polaron superfluids without the complications that arise in describing the inevitable coulomb interactions in electronic polarons @xcite .",
    "arguably , the polaron system provides the paradigm of a strongly interacting many - body environment modifying the properties of a single particle @xcite . in the original polaron problem",
    " the description of an electron in an ionic crystal  landau @xcite and later , landau and pekar @xcite showed that the electron self - localizes in the strong coupling regime . in an attempt to understand the role of backflow in the roton feature of the helium superfluid dispersion , feynman and cohen studied a different polaron : an impurity atom in a condensed @xmath2he superfluid @xcite .",
    "the paper by pines , miller and nozieres @xcite explicitly referred to this system as a polaron and pointed out the similarity between feynman s ansatz wavefunction and the wavefunction implied by a second - order perturbation calculation . in this sense , the polarons here can be defined as the excitations created through the interaction of the impurity with the bec atoms .",
    "cold atom physics is now poised to realize polarons of this type at strong coupling , creating structures that are smaller than the coherence length of the bec .",
    "these may provide a new handle with sub - coherence length resolution .",
    "the description of impurity - bec polarons brings in aspects of related problems .",
    "self - localization occurs at intermediate coupling , which is the challenging regime to describe .",
    "a feynman path integral description @xcite of the bec - impurity polaron showed a surprising , non - monotonic dependence of the polaron size with coupling strength near the coupling strength at which the strong coupling description predicts self - localization @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will work within the strong coupling description in the assumption that this description correctly captures the important trends .",
    "we describe the co - self - localization of multiple impurity atoms in which the many - body ground state properties become consistent with @xmath0 bosonic impurity atoms occupying the same single particle wavefunction of finite extent .",
    "the starting point of @xcite and @xcite , the assumption of a product state , was designed for the description of electron bubbles in helium superfluids @xcite .",
    "below , we show that the linearization of the bec response to the impurity wavefunction reproduces the results of the landau - pekar elimination of the boson modes which couple as in the frohlich hamiltonian to the single impurity atom in the bogoliubov approximation of the surrounding bec .",
    "that description shows that the energy reduction produced by the bec density response can be cast into the form of an attractive self - interaction potential .",
    "the linearization also shows that the frohlich impurity - bec coupling , the landau - pekar elimination and the resulting self - mediated interaction fail when the bec - density response becomes comparable to the density of the surrounding bec .",
    "when the bec - density is not affected much by the localized impurity , the structure of the impurity - bec system is that of a polaron .",
    "when the bec density is expelled by the impurity , the impurity becomes a ` bubble ' separated spatially from the bec .",
    "the physics of multiple , bosonic self - localized impurities is connected with the phenomenon of zero - temperature bose - einstein condensate phase separation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as we point out below .",
    "the response of a dilute bec to a localized object was studied in the context of a moving object that is significantly smaller than the healing length of the bec @xcite and in the context of a trapped ion interacting with the bec atoms @xcite via the polarization interaction of charged and polarizable particles",
    ". the polarization potential can also give rise to self - localization of the ion as shown in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we describe the ground state of a large bec with multiple , strongly coupled , mutually indistinguishable , bosonic impurity atoms embedded in a large dilute gas bose - einstein condensate . in the absence of the impurity atoms we take the bec to be homogeneous .",
    "the boson - boson , boson - impurity and impurity - impurity interactions are described by repulsive short - range effective interactions ( contact interactions ) .",
    "as mentioned , we assume that the impurity atoms co - self - localize : the self - localized impurity atoms do not only overlap , they occupy the same single - particle orbital .",
    "we find that multiple impurity atoms can self - localize at smaller values of the impurity - boson coupling constant , than a single impurity atom can .",
    "we identify the minimal number of impurity atoms needed to stabilize the self - localized polaron structure for fixed coupling constant as a property of the droplet formation process in the nucleation of the bec phase separation transition .",
    "when the short - range impurity - impurity interaction is sufficiently large , its competition with the self - localizing bec - mediated interaction can lead to a regime in which one impurity atom self - localizes but not two or more .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_single_impurity ] , we discuss the magnitudes , dimensions and coupling constants of single bec - impurity self - localization . in section [ sec_landaupekar ] ,",
    "we use the landau - pekar method for describing the single neutral atom bec - impurity problem so that we can later proceed beyond the homogeneous phonon description and investigate multiple impurities in the strong coupling limit . in section [ sec_multiimpurity ] , we examine the system of strongly coupled multi - impurity boson particles , followed by section [ sec_analysis ] , where we examine the multi - impurity polaron structure variationally and discuss the connection with bec - phase separation dynamics .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "first , we consider the zero - temperature self - localization of a neutral impurity atom embedded in a dilute gas bec .",
    "the impurity atom couples to the elementary bec excitations and forms a polaron . strictly speaking , the resulting object resembles a piezo - polaron since the bec excitations are acoustic phonon modes .",
    "the term ` piezo - polaron ' was originally used by mahan and hopfield @xcite , @xcite , for conduction electrons interacting with the acoustic modes in a piezoelectric crystal @xcite , @xcite . to bring the impurity atom to the strong coupling regime of self - localization ,",
    "we assume that either the impurity - boson scattering length @xmath3 is feshbach tuned to a large positive value or the boson - boson scattering length @xmath4 is tuned to a small positive value .",
    "we describe the orders of magnitude and discuss the experimental challenge of avoiding large bec depletion when impurity self - localization occurs .",
    "since many becs can be described as locally homogeneous ( i.e. , they are in the thomas - fermi limit ) , we consider the ground state of a homogeneous bec of @xmath5 indistinguishable boson atoms of mass @xmath6 , confined to a macroscopic volume @xmath7 , corresponding to an average density @xmath8 .",
    "two bosons at position @xmath9 and @xmath10 effectively interact via a contact potential @xmath11   \\delta\\left (   \\mathbf{x}_{i}-\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\right ) $ ] .",
    "the bec is dilute , so that the gas parameter @xmath12 is much smaller than unity , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "the chemical potential of the bec bosons is @xmath14 and the bec s healing length - the distance over which the bec - density tends to its asymptotic value if the condensate vanishes at a planar boundary - follows from equating the corresponding kinetic energy to @xmath15 .",
    "we will work with a coherence length @xmath16 for which @xmath17=2\\mu_{b}$ ] , which gives @xmath18 .",
    "the excitation of a collective phonon mode of momentum @xmath19 then costs energy @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the bec sound velocity .    throughout the paper",
    ", we refer to the bec atoms as b  and to the impurity neutral atoms as i. when impurity atoms of mass @xmath22 are added to the bec , the impurity atom at @xmath23 interacts with a bec atom at @xmath24 as well as with another impurity atom at @xmath25 via short - range interaction potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the scattering lengths describing the low energy impurity - boson and boson - boson scattering processes .",
    "we take all inter - particle interactions to be repulsive , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath4 is the scattering length of the potential @xmath32 .",
    "if the impurities are bosonic and coexist with the bec - bosons at sufficient density and at sufficiently low temperature , the system is a mixture of a b  and an i  condensate .",
    "the b - bec mediates interactions between the impurity atoms that are described by an attractive yukawa potential of range @xmath16 @xmath33 where we characterize the strength by an effective charge @xmath34 to emphasize the useful analogy with coulomb interactions .",
    "the appearance of a yukawa interaction is not surprising .",
    "it is known in quantum field theory @xcite that the interactions mediated by a scalar boson field ( provided by the bec ) takes the form of an attractive yukawa potential in a non - relativistic case . in accordance , the impurity atoms in the i - bec distributed at density @xmath35 experience a local chemical potential @xmath36 with a @xmath37 dependent contribution @xmath38   e^{-\\left\\vert \\mathbf{r}% -\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\right\\vert /\\xi}\\rho_{i}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } \\right )   \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\lambda_{ib}\\rho_{0}+\\left (   \\lambda_{ii}-4\\pi\\xi^{2}q^{2}\\right )   \\rho_{i}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the impurity bec is distributed homogeneously .",
    "the above chemical potential term implies a diverging i  compressibility ( @xmath39^{-1}$ ] ) when @xmath40 .",
    "it is the diverging compressibility that causes the zero - temperature bec phase separation that we describe in section [ sec_analysis ] .",
    "this transition occurs when the fetter - colson relation @xcite is satisfied @xmath41 , where @xmath32 so that @xmath42 is the value of the yukawa strength parameter .",
    "the bec mediated interaction is a consequence of bec density correlations : an impurity atom @xmath43 at @xmath23 causes a density variation in the bec that is experienced by impurity atom @xmath44 at @xmath24 as a change in its bec mean field energy . describing the impurity atoms by a quantum wavefunction , we find that even a single impurity is affected by bec density correlations .",
    "the impurity interaction energy density at @xmath45 is influenced by the impurity density at @xmath46 as the bec responds to the density of the entire impurity wavefunction . as we will see below",
    ", a single impurity then experiences an effective self - interaction @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "the integration of @xmath49  over @xmath45 and @xmath46 weighted by @xmath50 gives the gain in impurity - boson interaction energy by the adjustment of the bec density to the impurity wavefunction .    in the strong coupling limit , the effective self - interaction exceeds the kinetic energy cost of localizing the impurity .",
    "for the yukawa self - interaction to overcome the kinetic energy , the impurity has to localize to a size comparable to or less than @xmath16 . in that case , the self - interaction is coulomb - like in most of the impurity - region and , hence , is efficient at binding . as in the hydrogen atom description ,",
    "the length scale @xmath51  is determined by comparing coulomb and kinetic energies @xmath52 using equation ( [ q2 ] ) , @xmath53 $ ] , and @xmath54 , we find that the effective rydberg length is equal to @xmath55 aside from the mass factor @xmath56 , @xmath51 is the mean free path of an impurity atom that encounters hard - sphere scatterers of radius @xmath3 distributed at average density @xmath57 .",
    "the energy scale of impurity self - localization is given by the corresponding rydberg energy @xmath58 the mediated self - interaction can only bind with sufficient efficiency if the natural impurity size @xmath51  is comparable to or shorter than @xmath16 .",
    "the ratio of the bec - coherence and rydberg lengths , @xmath59 , is the only parameter left in the description of the impurity wavefunction after scaling the energy and length by @xmath60 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we call this dimensionless ratio , the impurity - boson coupling parameter , @xmath61 calculations @xcite indicate that a single impurity atom can self - localize if @xmath62 , where @xmath63 stands for the critical @xmath64 for a single impurity atom . as @xmath64 further increases , the self - localized impurity size shrinks to become a point - like object ( smaller than the bec coherence length ) .",
    "the calculation of a point - like potential moving with velocity @xmath65 @xcite gave an energy @xmath66 with @xmath67 , so that we might expect the effective polaron mass @xmath68 to be equal to @xmath69 or @xmath70 however , the calculation in @xcite was based on perturbation theory so that its validity does not extend to the large coupling limit . for the classic polaron treatment that describes an electron coupled to optical phonons , feynman estimated an effective mass that varies as the fourth power of the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "it is useful to express the observables in terms of the impurity - boson coupling constant @xmath64 .",
    "for instance , @xmath71 with @xmath72 representing the time scale relevant to impurity self - localization .",
    "the polaron description of the bec - impurity assumes that the phonon modes are excitations of a homogeneous bec .",
    "however , as the impurity - boson interaction is increased to reach the critical coupling @xmath73 , the impurity can deplete the b  condensate in its vicinity .",
    "the above description breaks down when the local bec - density variation @xmath74 becomes comparable to @xmath57 . for repulsive impurity - boson interactions we expect the single impurity wavefunction to take on a phase - separated bubble profile",
    "when @xmath75 .",
    "while this is interesting by itself , the impurity loses its frohlich - coupled polaron character in the bubble limit . as the self - interaction energy is the change in boson - impurity energy caused by",
    "the impurity induced variation in bec - density , @xmath76 or @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the bec gas parameter , @xmath79 , defined earlier in this section ( above equation ( [ one ] ) ) .",
    "can the self - localization of a single bec - impurity be realized in cold atom experiments ? at the end of the next section , we discuss whether cold atom technology can access the polaron regime ",
    "the parameter region where the density variation , @xmath74 , in equation ( [ deltarhob self ] ) remains significantly smaller than @xmath57 . here",
    "we discuss the experimental accessibility of the strong impurity - boson coupling regime , @xmath80 .",
    "three experimental challenges must be met .",
    "two of them relate to the requisite increase in impurity - boson scattering length .",
    "first of all , if that increase is effected by a magnetically controlled feshbach resonance , the magnetic field has to be sufficiently homogeneous and constant to avoid significant variations of the impurity - boson interactions .",
    "secondly , three body recombination into the large , two atom impurity - boson bound ( dimer ) state that becomes degenerate with the incident channel impurity - boson continuum as @xmath3 diverges , should not occur before the bec impurity has self - localized . as a third condition , we mention that the bec - temperature should be sufficiently low to prevent thermal fluctuations from de - self - localizing the strongly coupled bec impurity .",
    "how large does @xmath3 have to be ? estimating the necessary @xmath3 from@xmath81 with @xmath82 and a realistic mass ratio of @xmath83 , we find that @xmath84 if @xmath85 .",

    "hence , a slow magnetic field variation @xmath90 induces an @xmath3 variation@xmath91 for @xmath92 near @xmath89 , @xmath93 , so that@xmath94 requiring @xmath95 leads to @xmath96 .",
    "assuming , for instance , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath100 , the magnetic field variation is @xmath101 , which can be achieved in today s laboratories .",
    "in contrast , a broader resonance may require @xmath102 @xmath103 or @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "we now estimate the recombination time of the bec impurity atom in the worst case scenario .",
    "applying the same reasoning as in @xcite where the three - body recombination rate for a bec of large scattering length was first calculated , we expect a recombination rate of the form@xmath106 for a bec of large and positive @xmath4 , substituting @xmath107 and @xmath108 in equation ( [ recombination ] ) gives an overestimate of the recombination rate ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite found that the @xmath109 power has to be multiplied by an oscillating function of magnitude less than unity . near a node of the oscillating function",
    ", the recombination rate is much reduced . nevertheless , using equation ( [ recombination ] ) , we find@xmath110 where @xmath111 represents the time scale on which the bec can respond to the impurity and form the phonon cloud that accompanies the impurity in the polaron state",
    ". note that for @xmath112 , @xmath85 , @xmath113  can exceed @xmath114  by more than two orders of magnitude . finally , we comment on the temperature requirement for observing bec impurity self - localization .",

    "the polaron size increase was observed for a @xmath116-impurity in a @xmath117-bec in the case where the temperature ( @xmath118 ) was smaller than half the boson chemical potential .",
    "therefore , we expect that self - localization takes place when @xmath119 , where @xmath120 can be as large as @xmath121 . for a bec of @xmath122 , the temperature requirement of @xmath123",
    "can be easily achieved in today s cold atom experiments .",

    "the bec - field @xmath128 is @xmath129 , position independent for a homogeneous bec . assuming that the bec response to the impurity remains smaller than @xmath130 , @xmath131 , the equations can be linearized in @xmath132 .",
    "the resulting description is equivalent to the landau - pekar treatment we describe below .",
    "the product wavefunction reveals the connection with the analogous fluid with embedded droplet  system .",
    "the linearization procedure indicates how to proceed beyond the homogeneous phonon description .",
    "on the other hand , the landau - pekar method is most easily generalized to describe multiple impurities in the strong coupling limit .    in the absence of an impurity ,",
    "the excitations of the dilute bec are well - described in the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "this description transforms the operators that create and annihilate boson particles of momentum @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 to quasi - particle ( phonon ) creation and annihilation operators @xmath136 , @xmath137 , that diagonalize the linearized hamiltonian . adding a constant term , the transformed bec - hamiltonian reads @xmath138 where @xmath139 is stated in equation ( [ dispersion ] ) .",
