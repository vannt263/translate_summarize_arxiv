    "cooling flows in galaxy clusters , once thought to be on the order of 100  1000 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , are now understood to be depositing cool gas on the order of 1  10 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 onto the central cluster galaxy ( hereafter abbreviated to ccg ; voigt @xmath4 fabian 2004 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that some form of feedback ( agn , conduction etc . )",
    "prevents the intracluster medium from cooling , allowing only small amounts of cool gas to accrete onto the ccg .",
    "thus , ccgs lie at the interface where it is crucial to understand the role of feedback and accretion in star formation . within these cooling - flow ccgs , cool",
    "molecular clouds , warm ionized hydrogen , and the cooling intracluster medium are related . a complete view of the star formation process incorporates the stars with the gas and an understanding of the processes by which these phases interact , and therefore , requires information from several wavelength regimes .    various previous studies have reported several examples of ongoing star formation in ccgs , in particular those hosted by cooling - flow clusters ( cardiel , gorgas @xmath4 aragn - salamanca 1998 ; crawford et al .  1999 ; mcnamara et al .",

    "2010 ; liu , mao @xmath4 meng 2012 ) .",
    "although active star formation in these central galaxies is compelling , the young populations only contribute a very small mass fraction ( pipino et al .",
    "2009 ) , and it has been shown that star formation in these ccgs is correlated with the cooling time of the gas ( rafferty , mcnamara @xmath4 nulsen 2008 ; liu et al .  2012 ) .",
    "recent studies have even claimed that star forming central galaxies are exclusively hosted by cooling flow clusters ( hoffer et al .",
    "2012 , and references therein ) , although not all cooling - flow clusters contain star forming galaxies .",
    "the empirical boundary between clusters that host active central galaxies and clusters that never host them is @xmath5 kev @xmath6 , an entropy corresponding to an intracluster medium cooling time of @xmath7 gyr ( voit et al .",
    "the origin of the gas fuelling this star formation is not yet fully understood .",
    "probable explanations include processes involving the cooling flows , but cold gas deposited during a merging event can not be conclusively eliminated ( bildfell et al .",
    "2008 ) .    with the advent of more accurate methods to fit complex star formation histories ( sfh ) from high - quality optical spectroscopy , we are now in a position to directly compare the light / mass fraction of any possible present young stellar population component to the cooling rate of the host cluster .",
    "we proposed and obtained long - slit observations of ccgs with confirmed h@xmath0-filaments .",
    "we selected galaxies with near - ir ( 2mass ) , ultraviolet ( galex ) , x - ray data ( chandra ) , and vla 1.4 ghz fluxes , already available ( mcdonald et al .",
    "detailed properties of the host clusters , which are reported to influence the activity in the central galaxy ( as described above ) , such as central cooling times and the offset between the cluster x - ray peak and the central galaxy , have been derived in previous studies and are available in the literature .",
    "this data is complimentary to the emission - line , long - slit spectroscopy ( on keck and magellan ) along the h@xmath0 filaments of nine ccgs ( not including the four studied here ) by mcdonald et al .",
    "to get maximum possible information , we observed line ratios over a very long wavelength range ( around h@xmath0 and h@xmath8 ) with the slit aligned on , or as close as possible , to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "we can now place the derived information from the stellar population analysis of the optical spectra in context with multiwavelength data over the full spectrum , to explain the diverse nature of these galaxies .",
    "we introduce the sample and detail of the data reductions in sections [ sample ] and [ reduction ] .",
    "we then derive the kinematics as well as the stellar populations in section [ extinction ] .",
    "we proceed to discuss the four individual cases in section [ figures_individual ] .",
    "we summarise the findings of this paper in section [ summary ] .",
    "we have used the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath9 = 0.3 , @xmath10 = 0.7 , h@xmath11 = 70 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "we have chosen our sample of ccgs from the h@xmath0 imaging presented in mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who in turn , selected their sample from white , jones @xmath4 forman ( 1997 ) .",
    "mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2010 ) enforced the cuts : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , after which they selected 23 clusters to cover the full range of properties , from very rich clusters with high cooling rates to low - density clusters with very small cooling flows . from their 23 clusters , we selected all the clusters with clearly detected h@xmath0 in their centres ( albeit filamentary , extended or nuclear emission ) .",
    "in addition , all of these central galaxies have optical imaging , near - ir ( 2mass ) and uv ( galex data ) available .",
    "thereafter , we selected all the central galaxies with detailed x - ray ( chandra ) data , as well as vla 1.4 ghz fluxes , available .",
    "this resulted in a sub - sample of 10 galaxies .",
    "we observed four of these galaxies with the gmos ifu ( as presented in loubser @xmath4 soechting 2013 ) , and we observed four of these galaxies with the salt rss ( as shown in figure [ fig : thumbnails ] ) .",
    "this does not constitute a complete sample as we merely chose the objects with the most auxiliary information available .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have obtained , analysed and interpreted detailed , high spatial and spectral resolution , long - slit observations of four ccgs ( abell 0085 , 0133 , 0644 and ophiuchus ) recently obtained on salt , to probe the spatially - resolved kinematics and stellar populations of the stars .",
    "we use the pegase.hr model with the elodie v3.1 stellar library to determine the sfhs of the galaxies using the full spectrum fitting .",
    "we perform ssp as well as csp fits to acount for more complex sfhs .",
    "monte - carlo simulations and @xmath1-maps are used to check the reliability of the solutions .",
    "we emphasize that we only interpret the presence of young stellar components which is much more reliable than interpreting the absolute ages , metallicities and @xmath0-enhancements .",
    "hudson et al .  (",
    "2010 ) use the largest complete sample of 64 galaxy clusters ( highest x - ray flux galaxy cluster sample ) with available high - quality x - ray data from chandra , and apply 16 cool - core diagnostics to them . to segregate cool core and non - cool - core clusters , they find that central cooling time is the best parameter for low redshift clusters with high quality data .",
    "they further show that the discrepancy in classical and spectroscopic mass deposition rates can not be explained with a recent formation of the cool cores , demonstrating the need for a heating mechanism to explain the cooling flow problem .",
    "only a few ccgs have been reported in the literature with ongoing or recent bursts of star formation , and the majority  if not all of them  are hosted in cooling flow clusters .",
    "rafferty et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) and hoffer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that central galaxies in clusters with low entropy ( @xmath14 )  thus with large cooling rates  are the only ccgs to exhibit signs of vigorous star formation . here",
    ", we detect very small , but observable young stellar components in two of our four clusters which have no mass deposition rates ( or very little so that it is below the x - ray detection limit ) .",
    "this suggests another possible mechanism for the recent star formation such as galactic cannibalism that appears in cluster environments due to dynamical friction .",
    "we note that the spatially resolved recession velocity of these two galaxies ( 2masxj17122774 - 2322108 and eso541 - 013 ) show measurable rotation ( see figure [ fig : velocity ] ) , although the sample is too small to infer a possible difference between the kinematics of these galaxies and the galaxy with a younger component hosted by a cooling flow cluster .",
    "abell 0133 ( host of eso541 - 013 ) showed extended h - alpha filaments in mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , whereas the other three clusters examined here showed nuclear h - alpha emission . therefore no obvious correlation between the h - alpha gas and stellar kinematics exists .",
    "mergers that are not dissipation - less can supply fresh cold gas that can trigger an episode of star formation ( mihos @xmath4 hernquist 1996 ) . a large library of smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers ( di matteo et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) show that the average enhancement of the star formation rate in a random galaxy collision is only a factor of a few ( 3 - 4 being the median factor ) and only lasts 200 - 400 myr .",
    "this process is more efficient in dense clusters but the star formation rate increase remains in general below a factor of 10 or less ( martig @xmath4 bournaud 2008 ) .    since we have carefully measured the possible presence of emission lines ( with particular attention to the balmer lines ) , and could nt find any detections above three sigma of the noise of the spectra in any of the four objects - we conclude that our slit placement did not intercept the h@xmath0 filaments .",
    "thus in our data , the relatively young stars do not necessarily co - exist with the h@xmath0 emitting gas .",
    "this study , focussing on the detailed analysis of four objects , is complementary to our previous studies investigating the evolution and environmental influence in a larger sample of central cluster galaxies ( loubser et al .",
    "2008 , loubser @xmath4 sanchez - blazquez 2012 ) . throughout the investigation and analysis of the larger sample ,",
    "a picture emerged indicating that the kinematics and stellar population properties of the central galaxies are not very dependent on the galaxy mass ( with the exception of the metallicity gradients which are dependent on the galaxy velocity dispersions ) .",
    "similarly , various cluster properties also seem to have very limited influence on the central galaxy stellar population properties , such as cluster temperature or density . on the other hand , the offset between the x - ray peak of the cluster and the galaxy and the cooling flows in the clusters do influence the probability that the central galaxy will form stars . in loubser",
    "et al .  (",
    "2008 ) , we found that one of the six younger galaxies were hosted by a non - cooling flow cluster whereas the other five younger galaxies were hosted by a cooling - flow cluster .",
    "this previous study analysed only the ssp - equivalent ages , but reinforces the findings of the current study .",
    "all of these observations point to very diverse star formation histories of these central galaxies , and excludes the naive picture of very passive , homogeneous evolution .",
