    "together , these line and continuum observations can probe the physical conditions and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium in galaxies over much of the history of the universe .",
    "recent studies of gas and dust in high - redshift galaxies have used photoionization models along with measured values of the relative intensity between the fir continuum , low-_j _ co and [ cii ] line emission to constrain the ionization rate and density of the interstellar medium ( e.g. stacey et al .",

    "it is now possible to perform similar analyses at kpc scale resolution with some of the most distant starburst galaxies and agn , while also constraining their kinematic properties ( e.g. riechers et al .",
