    "survey of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath10 has been significantly developing in the last decade since the initial discovery papers @xcite . at @xmath11 ,",
    "many lae surveys with the subaru / suprime - cam ( s - cam ; @xcite ) have been made so far @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite have performed a deep lae survey at @xmath12 in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) and present a seminal luminosity function ( lf ) of ly@xmath0 emission at the redshift . @xcite",
    "have performed a very wide ( @xmath13 deg@xmath3 ) survey in the cosmos field and found no evidence of a large - scale clustering of bright ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath5 ) laes at @xmath12 . finally ,",
    "@xcite have reported results of a wide ( @xmath15 deg@xmath3 ) and deep survey in the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) field and confirmed the lf by @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite report a factor of 5 variation of the number density of laes among their 5 fields of view of s - cam .",
    "on the other hand , few surveys had been reported to date at @xmath16 @xcite and a significant improvement is arising @xcite . a largest sample of laes at @xmath1",
    "reported so far is the one in the sdf presented by @xcite . based on this sample ,",
    "@xcite have constructed the ly@xmath0 lf at the redshift and found that a significant reduction at the bright - end relative to the @xmath12 lf by @xcite .",
    "they interpret this reduction as a signature of the end epoch of the cosmic reionization .",
    "the cosmic reionization is one of the most drastic event in the history of the universe and it happened at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the reionization was probably triggered by the first - generation of stars and galaxies .",
    "thus , the event contains the information of the structure formation in the early universe .",
    "the subsequent galaxy formation proceeded in the reionized universe and was significantly affected by the ionizing background radiation .",
    "this is a complex astrophysical process ( or feedback ) which is one of the most important issues to be resolved in observational cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the discovery of the gunn - peterson trough @xcite in spectra of qsos and a grb at @xmath18 @xcite marks the end of the reionization epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue that the evolution of ly@xmath0 lf between @xmath12 and @xmath1 which they found is another signature of the end epoch ; since the measurements of ultraviolet ( uv ) lf of the laes agree very well between the two redshifts , the apparent faintness of ly@xmath0 emission of @xmath1 laes is caused by an increase of attenuation by neutral hydrogen remained in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at @xmath19 .",
    "a significant variation in the igm transmission found in the spectra of @xmath18 qsos suggests inhomogeneous reionization @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also show inhomogeneity of the reionization process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this means that there may be a large variation in the end epoch of the reionization among lines of sight .",
    "if it is true , the number density of @xmath1 laes may variate significantly among different survey fields . indeed ,",
    "@xcite report such a large variation between two fields of view of s - cam .",
    "therefore , another survey of @xmath1 laes similar to @xcite is indispensable to discuss such a field - to - field variation .",
    "this paper presents a photometric sample of @xmath1 laes found in the archival imaging data taken with s - cam towards the ssa22 field .",
    "some of the laes have been confirmed by spectroscopy in @xcite .",
    "then , we compare the number density of the laes in the ssa22 field with that in the sdf in order to discuss the field - to - field variation quantitatively .",
    "the structure of the rest of this paper is as follows ; first , we describe the imaging data used in this paper in  2 .",
    "then , we present the photometric sample of @xmath1 laes in the ssa22 in  3 . in  4 , we compare the ly@xmath0 lf derived in the ssa22 with that in the sdf , and also compare the number density of @xmath6-drop galaxies in the two fields . in  5 , we discuss the cause of the small number of laes in the ssa22 .",
    "the final section provides the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the cosmology adopted in this paper is a flat @xmath20cdm cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "all magnitudes are described by the ab system : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 in unit of erg s@xmath5 @xmath26 hz@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we have collected imaging data of the ssa22 field ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; j2000 ) taken with subaru / suprime - cam ( s - cam ; @xcite ) from the archive data system , smoka ( subaru - mitaka - okayama - kiso archive system ; @xcite ) .",
    "the collected broadband data are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath6 , and @xmath32 . in order to select @xmath16 laes",
    ", we use the imaging data through a narrowband nb912 ( central wavelength of 9,139   and full width at half maximum [ fwhm ] of 134  ) whose efficiency curve is shown in figure 1 .",
    "table  1 is a summary of the imaging data .",
    "nb912 was used for the ssa22 field ( this work ) but nb921 was used for the sdf ( taniguchi et al .",
    "the efficiencies include the ccd quantum efficiency as well as the filter transparencies.,width=226 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as an alternative scenario , if neutral hydrogen remains more in the ssa22 than in the sdf at @xmath1 , ly@xmath0 emission is more heavily obscured in the ssa22 , and thus , the number density of the observable laes decreases in the ssa22 . as found in figure 6 , the cumulative lf in the ssa22 is almost reproduced if the ly@xmath0 luminosity in the sdf is reduced by a factor of 0.6 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 transmission through the igm is roughly proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath8 is the hydrogen neutral fraction in the igm .",
    "therefore , the factor of 0.6 reduction of ly@xmath0 luminosity can be interpreted as a factor of about 2 larger @xmath8 in the ssa22 than in the sdf .",
    "@xcite have already found a significant reduction of the ly@xmath0 luminosity at @xmath1 relative to @xmath12 in the sdf and argue that the igm is more neutral at @xmath1 than @xmath12 .",
    "their estimation based on @xcite model is @xmath34 at @xmath1 .. the ly@xmath0 luminosity reduction ( or igm transmission of ly@xmath0 ) could be accounted for by almost ionized igm if there is no galactic wind ( see fig .  25 in @xcite ) . ] in the ssa22 , there may be a further factor of @xmath35 reduction of ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "this is translated into @xmath9 at @xmath1 in the ssa22 .",
    "therefore , more than half hydrogen may be still neutral at @xmath1 in the ssa22 field .",
    "the furthest known lae is iok-1 at @xmath36 found in the sdf by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have constrained @xmath8 at @xmath37 in the sdf based on this one object : @xmath380.6 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosity of this object is @xmath39 erg s@xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", we could not find any lae candidates with @xmath40 erg s@xmath5 at @xmath1 in the ssa22 .",
    "the number density of @xmath37 lae in the sdf is @xmath41 mpc@xmath42 for @xmath40 erg s@xmath5 which may match with an extrapolation of the ssa22 lf shown in figure  6 .",
    "this may imply that the ssa22 at @xmath1 is as neutral as the sdf at @xmath37 .",
    "if the @xmath1 igm in the ssa22 field is more neutral than that in the sdf and ly@xmath0 luminosity in the ssa22 field is reduced , an effect may appear in the ly@xmath0 ew distribution .",
    "figure  7 shows the observed ly@xmath0 ew as a function of uv luminosity for @xmath1 photometric lae samples in the ssa22 field and in the sdf .",
    "although we expect that the ews of the ssa22 sample are systematically smaller than those of the sdf sample , we can not find such a trend . on the other hand , the uv luminosities in the ssa22 field",
    "may be systematically smaller than those in the sdf , which may indicate that the small number of the laes in the ssa22 field is due to a cosmic variance .",
    "however , in any case , we can not extract any conclusion due to the small statistics of the ssa22 sample . a future work with a much larger sample",
    "is required .",
    "equivalent width as a function of uv luminosity .",
    "the squares are the @xmath1 lae candidates in the ssa22 field and the crosses are those in the sdf .",
    "the arrows indicate upper or lower limits for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , respectively.,width=264 ]",
    "this paper presents results of a deep survey of @xmath1 lae candidates in the ssa22 field based on the imaging data collected with subaru / s - cam .",
    "we have selected the lae candidates by the standard technique based on a narrowband excess by an emission line and drop - outs at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the adopted narrowband is nb912 which can capture ly@xmath0 emission at @xmath456.57 .",
    "we have also selected @xmath6-drop galaxies for a comparison .",
    "these galaxies exist at a similar high redshift to but more extended range than the lae candidates .",
    "a summary of the observational findings is as follows ; the number of the lae candidates with @xmath46 erg s@xmath5 in the observed area of @xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 in the ssa22 field is only 14 . the co - moving number density of the lae candidates is a factor of 3 smaller than that in the sdf reported by @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the number densities of @xmath6-drop galaxies in the two fields agree within the poisson error .",
    "we have considered two possibilities accounting for the small number density of the lae candidates in the ssa22 : ( 1 ) fluctuation due to the large - scale structure ( i.e. so - called cosmic variance ) and ( 2 ) fluctuation of the neutral fraction of hydrogen in the igm . in the cosmic variance scenario ,",
    "the probability to have the small number density as in the ssa22 field is 7% if we assume the sdf to be the cosmic average .",
    "therefore , the ssa22 field at @xmath1 may be a rare void",
    ". however , there is no evidence of such a void in the @xmath6-drop galaxies although their redshift range is different from the lae candidates .    if the neutral fraction in the igm is higher in the ssa22 than in the sdf , a part of ly@xmath0 emission is more heavily obscured in the ssa22 .",
    "indeed , a factor of about 2 reduction of ly@xmath0 luminosity in the sdf provides a good fit of the ssa22 ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "this is interpreted as a factor of about 2 higher neutral fraction in the ssa22 field than in the sdf . even in the sdf",
    ", @xmath1 ly@xmath0 lf indicates a factor of 2 reduction of ly@xmath0 luminosity relative to @xmath12 and this reduction puts a constraint on the neutral fraction at @xmath1 as @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may obtain @xmath9 at @xmath1 in the ssa22 .",
    "this is similar to that at @xmath37 in the sdf reported by @xcite .    in any case",
    ", the smallness of the number density of the @xmath1 lae candidates in the ssa22 clearly shows that there is a large fluctuation of the lae number density at this high redshift as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reports a factor of 5 variation in the number densities of @xmath12 laes among 5 fields - of - view of the s - cam .",
    "therefore , we need a much wider survey area than the surveys reported here and previously in order to obtain a robust mean lf of @xmath1 laes and a robust mean neutral fraction in the igm at the redshift .",
