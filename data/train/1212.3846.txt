    "<S> this observation is consistent with the theoretical expectation that the lp to caf or f transition is first order while the caf to f transition is second order@xcite .        by identifying characteristic energy scales for the external symmetry breaking terms </S>",
    "<S> , we can comment quantitatively on the phase boundaries for a fixed @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify zeeman energy @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electron spin g - factor and the bohr magneton respectively , and the interlayer potential energy @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the interlayer distance in blg . for @xmath37 t , at low @xmath9 the caf - lp transition occurs at @xmath44 mev , and at @xmath45 the caf - f transition occurs at @xmath46 mev . the f - lp transition occurs along a line whose slope @xmath47 . the fact that @xmath48 at the f - lp phase boundary is of order unity is consistent with the increasing stability of a spin - polarized state with increasing magnetic field , providing further confirmation that the conducting @xmath0 phase is a ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since at the cnp and @xmath22 , @xmath8 is the only physical quantity to control the strength of e - e interactions , the phase boundary between the caf and f phases can be further investigated by observing @xmath16 as a function of @xmath9 with different values of fixed @xmath8 ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",

    "<S> 4b displays @xmath52 as a function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> although there are only a few data points available to indicate the phase boundary , the general trend of the caf - f phase transition can be inferred from them .    finally , we remark on the similarity between the f phase of blg at @xmath0 and the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) in hgte@xcite . in the qsh phase quantized conduction is due to spin - polarized counter - propagating edge states , while the bulk remains incompressible . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous scenario is expected for blg in the f quantum hall state@xcite , except that blg carriers an additional orbital degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> the f state in bl graphene is therefore expected to exhibit a four terminal conductance of @xmath1 , compared with @xmath53 for hgte . </S>",
    "<S> similar to reported measurements of hgte@xcite , our devices show imperfect quantization with measured conductance values less than @xmath1 in the f phase . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced conductance may be due to backscattering in the edge state or through remaining impurity states in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> unambiguous experimental support for the existence of spin - polarized counter - propagating edge states should be provided by well - quantized nonlocal measurements @xcite ( see supplementary information ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured dual - gated graphene bilayers at the @xmath0 state . in a perpendicular magnetic field , we observe a transition between two incompressible states at a finite displacement field , indicating that the @xmath22 state is not layer polarized . at low displacement fields , we observe four - terminal conductance increase and then saturate as in - plane magnetic field increases , showing that the @xmath22 , @xmath20 state is also not spin polarized . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a quantum phase transition driven by in - plane magnetic field between the canted antiferromagnet quantum hall state and the ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the near quantization of the 4-terminal conductance to @xmath1 agrees with predictions that the ferromagnetic quantum hall ground state carries spin - polarized counter - propagating edge states . </S>"
