    "the enhanced production of strange particles in nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) relatively to proton - proton ( pp ) or proton - nucleus ( pa ) collisions , was since long , argued @xcite to be a signal of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "this enhancement is seen in all experiments at all energies from ags to sps up to rhic .",
    "furthermore , enhancement of strange baryons and anti - baryons was predicted to depend on their strangeness content and to appear in a typical hierarchy , @xmath2 , which was observed in particular by the wa97 @xcite , na57",
    "@xcite and na49 @xcite collaborations . these enhancement features and hierarchy , are argued to be expected at all energies as a consequence of a canonical thermal phase - space suppression .",
    "when describing a statistical system there are at least two ways of implementing the conservation laws of quantum numbers . in the grand canonical ( gc ) formulation conservation of a quantum number",
    "is ensured on average by use of the corresponding chemical potential .",
    "this description is only valid when particles , with a given conserved charge , are produced with a large multiplicity ( system of a large volume and/or high temperature ) . in the canonical formulation ( c ) conservation of a quantum number",
    "is implemented exactly on an event - by - event basis .",
    "this approach is relevant when particles carrying a given conserved charge are produced with a small multiplicity ( system of small volume and/or low temperature ) . in the usual definition of se one",
    "compares the yield per participant of a given particle @xmath3 with strangeness @xmath4 in the large aa system to the yield per participant , of the same particle , in the small pp or pa system . assuming that the volume parameter scales with the number of participants , @xmath5 , the enhancement of this particle is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number density of particle @xmath3 . from the above considerations , the pp ( or pa ) system has to be described in the canonical formulation . in principle , all conserved charges ( baryon number @xmath8 , electric charge @xmath9 , and strangeness @xmath10 ) have to be treated canonically",
    "however , with a good approximation , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be treated grand canonically even in high energy pp collisions .",
    "this results in a slight overestimate of the canonical effect @xcite .",
    "the canonical partition function of a gas of particles and resonances having strangeness @xmath11 , and with total strangeness @xmath12 can be written as @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , is the sum over all particles and resonances carrying strangeness @xmath15 and where @xmath16 is the one - particle partition function of particle @xmath17 with multiplicity @xmath18 , mass @xmath19 , baryon number @xmath20 , electric charge @xmath21 and the corresponding chemical potentials @xmath22 and @xmath23 . from eq.([zc ] ) one can derive @xcite the canonical density @xmath24 and show that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the grand canonical density and @xmath27 is the suppression factor that measures a deviation of @xmath28 from its asymptotic , grand canonical value . for large @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and",
    "@xmath28 reaches its grand canonical value .",
    "-1.cm    from eq.([enh ] ) , se for a given @xmath32 relative to pp is determined from @xmath33 figure 1 displays an example of the suppression factor at @xmath34 gev .",
    "the enhancement hierarchy at corresponding energy , as seen in figure 2 , is a direct consequence of the behavior of the suppression factor with the strangeness content of the particle @xcite .",
    "thus , se can indeed appear as a canonical suppression effect .",
    "we have studied @xcite the energy dependence of se at four energies:@xmath35 gev ( na49 , na57 , wa97 , sps ) and @xmath36 gev ( rhic ) . at 17.3 and 130",
    "gev the values of @xmath30 and @xmath22 were taken from the thermal fit from @xcite . at @xmath37 8.73 and 12.3 gev",
    "the values of these parameters were determined following unified freeze - out curve @xcite and by using the measured @xmath38 ratio at the relevant energies .",
    "moreover , as a first approximation , the assumption have been made that the thermal parameters are independent of centrality .",
    "we have shown that se is a decreasing function of collision energy @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath0 is given in figure 3 . in figure 4",
    "the model predictions are compared to the recent experimental data of na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the experimental points are deduced from the @xmath39 ratio @xcite multiplied by @xmath40 in aa and in pp collisions @xcite at the same energy .",
    "the solid line in figure 4 is the prediction of the canonical statistical model .",

    "canonical suppression plays an important role in se .",
    "the present canonical statistical model naturally describes @xcite the bulk properties of the wa97 data for @xmath41 , that show se hierarchy , and _ saturation _ of the yields per participant for large @xmath42 .",
    "however , the quantitative understanding of the recent data of the na57 collaboration @xcite , showing a smooth increase of that yields with @xmath43 and a significant change in the behavior of @xmath44 ( the yield rises from @xmath45 to @xmath46 by a factor 2.6 ) would required a further study on the behavior of thermal parameters with centrality @xcite .",
    "these new features of na57 data may be understood admitting a non - linear dependence of the canonical correlation volume or of the off - equilibrium strangeness fugacity with centrality @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the enhancement hierarchy and the decrease of enhancement with increasing collision energy are a generic features of the canonical statistical thermal model that are independent on the particular choice of the parameters .",
    "the most recent na49 data on @xmath0 yields seem to support the model prediction that se is a decreasing function of collisions energy . however , experimental confirmation of these behavior by even more spectacular variation of @xmath47 and @xmath48 enhancement with @xmath49 would be required .",
    "we note that urqmd @xcite and dpm @xcite predicts a larger se at rhic than at sps energy , which is in contrast to present statistical model results .",
