    "g78.2 + 2.1 ( or dr4 ) is a nearby shell - type supernova remnant ( snr ) with a radio diameter of @xmath160 arcmin ( higgs , landecker , & roger , 1977 ) .",
    "g78.2 + 2.1 has been of particular interest recently because of its possible association with unidentified @xmath0-ray sources in the galactic plane .",
    "if it is associated , then the question of whether the @xmath0-rays are produced by a young pulsar or by high - energy particles accelerated by the supernova shock can be addressed .    at a galactic longitude of 78@xmath2 , g78.2 + 2.1",
    "is located in the cygnus x region of the galactic plane , about 2.5 degrees from the center of cygnus x. cygnus x is about 6 degrees in diameter and is one of the most nearby massive star forming regions within our galaxy ( for a review e.g. see kndlseder , 2004 ) .",
    "the most massive stars in cygnus x reside at its center in the cyg ob2 association , which is at a distance of 1.3 - 1.5 kpc as determined recently by vlbi parallax measurements ( rygl et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "the age of cyg ob2 is 3 - 4 myr , with total lyman continuum luminosity of @xmath3 ph / s and total mechanical luminosity of a few @xmath4 erg / s ( knodlseder , et al .",
    "2002 ) the cyg ob2 association injects enough kinetic energy , that a superbubble shell should have been created with radius of @xmath160pc and velocity 20 km / s ( lozinskaya et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "x - rays from the superbubble interior were detected by cash et .",
    "al ( 1980 ) , but other evidence is confusing . a recent study of molecular gas , using the co line , across a significant area ( @xmath12 degrees by 4 degrees ) of cygnus x was carried out by gottschalk et al.(2012 ) . in summary ,",
    "their findings are : i ) there are three layers of gas across the region , at radial velocities of 0 to 8 km / s ( layer 1 ) , -10 to 0 km / s ( layer 2 ) and above 8 km / s ( layer 3 ) .",
    "ii ) layer 1 shows extensive hi self - absorption , is nearest to us and is associated with cold gas and dust in the great cygnus rift , located at a distance of 500 - 800 pc ( schneider et al .",
    "hi absorption profiles indicate that layer 3 , associated with w75n and dr17 , is in front of layer 2 , associated with dr21 , g82.6 + 0.4 and iras 23350 + 4126 .",
    "iii ) the fact that layer 3 is redshifted with respect to the expected radial velocity of cyg ob2 and layer 2 is blueshifted is not consistent with the picture of an expanding shell of molecular gas around ob2 .",
    "an important implication of this study is that radial velocities do not fit in with a simple circular rotation model for the galaxy in the cygnus x region .",
    "the snr g78.2 + 2.1 has been observed several times at radio , optical and x - ray wavelengths . in radio ,",
    "several spectral index studies have been carried out , with one of the most comprehensive by zhang et al .",
    "optical and x - ray observations were reported by lozinskaya et al .",
    "they searched for but did not find an optical shell associated with g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "x - ray image was found to have a shell structure similar to the radio image .",
    "the asca x - ray spectra were analysed to find temperatures of 1.4@xmath50.1 kev for an equilibrium ionization plasma model and 2.8@xmath50.4 kev for a non - equilibrium ionization plasma model .",
    "uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also analysed asca x - ray observations of g78.2 + 2.1 and showed images in 3 energy bands : 0.7 - 1 kev , 1 - 3 kev and 4 - 7 kev .",
    "the two lower energy band images show an irregular shell structure for g78.2 + 2.1 and the high energy band shows two compact bright spots , labelled c1 and c2 .",
    "the compact spots are not coincident with the egret @xmath0-ray sources 2eg j2020 + 4026 or 3eg j2020 + 4017 .",
    "their asca spectral analysis shows that the diffuse emission ( their regions r1 , r2 and r3 ) is well fit with an 0.5 - 0.8 kev thermal plasma , and that their regions c1 and c2 have an additional power - law components with spectral indices @xmath6 .",
    "mavromatakis ( 2003 ) imaged the g78.2 + 2.1 region in h@xmath7+[nii ] , [ sii ] and [ oiii ] filters , noting that the region is dominated by emission from several hii regions .",
    "long - slit spectra at one position detected shock - heated gas ( with [ sii]/h@xmath7 @xmath8 0.6 ) , with estimated shock velocity below 100 km / s and pre - shock density @xmath120 @xmath9 .",
    "the h@xmath7/h@xmath10 ratio was 10 for this region , equivalent to a column density of 6@xmath1110@xmath12@xmath13 .",

    "ladouceur & pineault ( 2008 ) use the canadian galactic plane survey continuum data for g78.2 + 2.1 to better delineate the extent of the snr and the spatial spectral index variations , finding an spatially - averaged spectral index of 0.75@xmath50.3 , steeper than previous studies .",

    "s21 has the best determined position of ( @xmath7(j2000)=@xmath16 , @xmath17(j2000)=@xmath18 ) with a position error of @xmath19 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is best fit by a blackbody , although bremmstrahlung and mekal models can not be ruled out .",
    "it also has quite uncertain x - ray column density and thus distance : 2(+5,-2 ) or 6(+6,-4)@xmath1110@xmath12@xmath13 , respectively for black - body and bremsstrahlung emission models , and higher values of 10(+8,-5 ) or 16(+6,-3)@xmath1110@xmath12@xmath13 for power - law and mekal models .",
    "thus the association with the snr g78.2 + 2.1 is uncertain .",

    ", our focus is to understand the physical properties of g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "we carry out a comprehensive analysis of x - ray observations from _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations , to delineate the x - ray structure of g78.2 + 2.1 and to sort out the conflicting results of previous x - ray spectral studies on g78.2 + 2.1 . also , we obtain new hi absorption spectra by analysis of the hi line and 1420 mhz continuum observations from the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps , english et al .",

    "we found that _",
    "rosat _ pspc pointed observations covered all of g78.2 + 2.1 but not its surroundings , and that _ chandra _ observations covered only part of g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "thus we obtained all three sets of data for analysis .",
    "the archival x - ray observations from _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ for the g78.2 + 2.1 region were obtained from nasa s heasarc website .",
    "data ( images , photon event lists and associated files ) which covered any part of g78.2 + 2.1 or its nearby surroundings were obtained .",

    "data were processed using the ftools and heasoft software packages , available at the heasarc website .",
    "rosat guest observer facility analysis procedures were used ( ogip memo 94 - 010 ) .",
    "the following ftools were used to make the rosat mosaic : xselect ( to limit the range of pha channels used in each image ) , fimconcat ( to make a blank image ) , fimgmerge ( to add in the individual counts images ) ( a separate image was made for the counts map and for the exposure map ) , farith ( to create a count - rate map from counts and exposure maps ) , and fgauss ( to smooth the count - rate map ) . to make an image using only the central high resolution parts of each pspc image",
    ", we used xselect on the individual counts and exposure images before merging .",

    "the standard archive acis good time intervals were used as no significant flares were seen in the data .",

    "similar to the methods for creating the rosat mosaics , a combined counts image and a combined exposure image were created , then divided to obtain the count - rate map , and then gaussian smoothing was applied .",
    "radio observations in 1420 mhz continuum and the hi spectral line were made as part of the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps , english et al .",
    ", 1998 , taylor et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "we extracted the 1420 mhz image of g78.2 + 2.1 from the survey data .",
    "we used the hi line data together with the continuum data to determine hi absorption spectra for g78.2 + 2.1 . since it is an extended source rather than a point source , the standard formula for hi absorption spectra does not apply .",
    "the background region has to be chosen to be near the continuum peak , in order to minimize the difference in the galactic hi distribution along the lines - of - sight to source and background regions ( leahy & tian , 2008 , and tian & leahy , 2008 ; see leahy & tian , 2010 for a review ) . because the brightest continuum emission and adjacent background emission were separated by a curved boundary , instead of boxes for source and background we used regions defined by t@xmath23 .",
    "we used the software program meanlev in the drao export package which allows one to extract spectra for source and background regions defined by user specified t@xmath23 levels .",
    "we describe the radio image and absorption spectra first , because we use the image to locate the extent of the supernova remnant on the x - ray images .",
    "fig.1 shows the 1420 mhz continuum image in the area around g78.2 + 2.1 , in galactic coordinates ( ladoucer and pineault , 2008 , published a similar image ) .",
    "the image shows the shell - like radio morphology , with brightest filaments at the bottom ( low b ) , and very faint parts of the shell at upper right and at lower left . as noted previously ( e.g. higgs et al . , 1977 ) , the @xmath0 cygni nebula ( drake , 1959 ) is located at l , b=78.18@xmath2,+1.82@xmath2 and is a small bright region on the face of g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "the @xmath0cygni nebula has a thermal radio spectrum ; the other regions have a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "hi absorption spectra were constructed for a number ( 7 ) of different continuum emission areas across g78.2 + 2.1 , including the @xmath0 cygni nebula .",
    "the galactic coordinates ( l , b ) of the centers of these regions ( which are extended unless noted ) are : ( 1)(point source ) 78.51@xmath2,+2.32@xmath2 ; ( 2)(point source ) 77.83@xmath2,+2.40@xmath2 ; ( 3 ) 78.29@xmath2,+2.46@xmath2 ; ( 4)(@xmath0 cygni nebula ) 78.18@xmath2,+1.82@xmath2 ; ( 5 ) 78.01@xmath2,+1.78@xmath2 ; ( 6 ) 78.37@xmath2,+1.75@xmath2 ; and ( 7 ) 78.11@xmath2,+1.73@xmath2 .",
    "the emission spectra for all 7 regions are similar to the spectra shown in figure 2 for region 7 of the snr and for the @xmath0 cygni nebula .",
    "region 7 is the bright filament just below the @xmath0 cygni nebula ( region 4 ) .",
    "the spectrum contains emission from hi interior to the solar circle at positive radial velocities ( 0 to + 25 km / s ) and from the outer galaxy on the far side of the solar circle in the direction of l=78.2@xmath2 ( 0 to -100 km / s ) .",
    "the absorption spectra for the 7 regions can be separated into two groups .",
    "one group shows absorption spectra nearly identical to that of the bright filament of region 7 .",
    "it demonstrates absorption at all positive velocities and at negative velocities above -8 km / s .",
    "the other regions in this group are 3 , 4 ( the @xmath0 cygni nebula ) , 5 and 6 .",
    "region 3 is the brightest diffuse emission in the upper part of g78.2 + 2.1 ( see fig.1 left ) . because it has low continuum 1420 mhz brightness , the hi spectrum is quite noisy but shows clear absorption at velocities more positive than @xmath1 - 10 km / s .",
    "region 5 is of lower continuum brightness than region 4 or 7 so has more noise but otherwise is very similar to the spectrum for region 7 .",
    "region 6 is the filament at the lower left rim of g78.2 + 2.1 and also has an hi absorption spectrum very similar to region 7 .",
    "thus all of the diffuse emission regions in g78.2 + 2.1 were found to show absorption at velocities greater than -8 km / s but no absorption for velocities less than this value .    the total galactic column density in the direction of g78.2 + 2.1 is @xmath24 @xmath13 from the nh ftool , which is based on hi surveys . from an integration of the absorption spectrum of fig .",
    "1 ( right ) we find @xmath25 @xmath13 for g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "this value includes the correction for optical depth ( see e.g. binney & merrifield(1998 ) pp.468 - 473 ) .",
    "the two point sources make up the other group of absorption spectra .",
    "region 1 is the point source at the upper left interior of g78.2 + 2.1 and region 2 is the point source at the upper right .",
    "both clearly shows absorption at all velocities ( + 25km / s to @xmath26 - 100 km / s ) , so are identified as extragalactic background radio sources .                in figure 3(a )",
    ", we present the flux - corrected _ rosat _ all - sky image of the g78.2 + 2.1 region in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "this image is overlaid with the 25 , 32 , and 42 k 1420 mhz contours of g78.2 + 2.1 ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) and includes the region north of g78.2 + 2.1 . from this rass image",
    ", we can see that there is significant x - ray emission associated with the @xmath0cygni region .",
    "there is an irregular x - ray shell that coincides with radio emission of the snr g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "however , there is also emission extending north of the remnant .",
    "this extra emission roughly takes the form of a second shell centered near ( @xmath7(j2000)=@xmath27 , @xmath17(j2000)=@xmath28 ) .",
    "the second shell does not show any evidence of radio emission : adjacent cgps radio mosaics were examined and show that there is no radio shell associated with the x - ray emission .",
    "we combined the _",
    "pspc pointed observations into a single mosaic image in two different ways .",
    "first we included the entire field of pspc pointing in the mosaic .",
    "this results in maximum exposure time ( and thus sensitivity ) but because of the rapidly increasing size of the point - spread - function with off - axis angle , this also results in poor spatial resolution .",
    "next we excluded the outer areas of each pointing to exclude the low resolution data and made a higher resolution mosaic .",
    "because of mirror vignetting , the loss of sensitivity compared to the first mosaic is small .",
    "the mosaics were made for both soft ( 0.1 - 0.4 kev ) and hard ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) bands .",
    "the hard and soft maps were smoothed using a 2 arcmin gaussian .",
    "the soft image shows only faint diffuse emission with no emission associated with g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "this can be attributed to the x - ray absorption column density of the intervening interstellar medium , which prevents any emission from g78.2 + 2.1 from below 0.4 kev from reaching us .",
    "the high - resolution _ rosat _ pspc 0.5 - 2.0 kev x - ray image is shown in figure 3(b ) , overlaid with the 1420 mhz radio contours of g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "it reveals that the x - ray emission forms an incomplete shell within the radio shell of the snr .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission is located at the south - west radio boundary of the snr .",
    "in contrast , where the radio emission is brightest ( in the south - east corner of g78.2 + 2.1 , near @xmath7(j2000)=@xmath29 , @xmath17(j2000)=@xmath30 there are just several small spots of x - ray emission .",
    "other prominent x - ray emission is seen inside the northern boundary of g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "this coincides with the second brightest area in radio emission ( see fig .",
    "the x - ray and radio emission at the west boundary and in the western interior part of g78.2 + 2.1 are both very faint .",
    "there is clear x - ray emission beyond the northern boundary of the radio snr .",
    "the morphology of this emission , seen in fig .",
    "3(b ) , is fully consistent with that seen in the lower resolution rass image of fig .",
    "3(a ) , which shows the full extent of the large x - ray shell centered near ( @xmath7(j2000)=@xmath27 , @xmath17(j2000)=@xmath28 ) . from fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , it is not possible to tell whether the emission along the northern boundary of g78.2 + 2.1 originates from the snr itself , or from the northern shell , or from a combination of both .",
    "._rosat _ pspc pointed observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath31 1@xmath32 error values used .",
    "+ @xmath33 simultaneous fit from datasets 12676 and 2826 .",
    "we produce the first quantitative absorption spectra for snr g78.1 + 2.1 and the @xmath0 cygni nebula .",
    "higgs et al.(1977 ) present an emission plus fractional absorption profile which shows similarity to our absorption spectrum . however , quantitative comparison with our results is not possible because they do not explain how their combined emission and absorption profile is calculated , nor do they give the location of their extraction regions .",
    "the most negative velocity of absorption is -8 km / s , consistently for the different hi absorption spectra that were extracted for g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "to interpret this in terms of distance is not simple . as noted by gottschalk et al.(2012 ) , radial velocities in the cygnus x region , of which g78.2 + 2.1 is part , do not follow a circular rotation model . rather the molecular gas is in three layers ( see introduction above ) .",
    "since all three layers show up in absorption in the hi spectrum of g78.2 + 2.1 , the snr must be either in or behind the furthest of the layers , layer 2 , which is at a distance of 1.5 - 2.5 kpc ( gottschalk et al .",
    "2012 ) , different from its distance inferred using a circular rotation curve model .",
    "thus 1.5 - 2.5 kpc lower distance limit of layer 2 is taken as the lower limit to the distance to the snr .",
    "we note that gottschalk et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show relative absorption profiles for sources in cygnus x for a region 3 - 4 degrees away from g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "two of the sources have measured parallax distances : 1.3 kpc for w75n and 1.5 kpc for dr21 ( rygl et al .",
    "these two sources have different maximum velocities of absorption : @xmath1 + 3 km / s for w75n and @xmath1 - 20 km / s for dr21 ( gottschalk et al .",
    "thus the absorption spectrum is not of use to obtain any better distance limit than the lower limit mentioned above .",
    "ladouceur & pineault ( 2008 ) discusses hi emission in the region .",
    "their figs .",
    "19 , 21 and 23 shows hi emission averaged over channels for velocities of + 3 to + 18 km / s , + 3 to + 9 km / s and -19 to -11 km / s , respectively . for + 3 to + 18 km /",
    "s they claim that the low intensity features are absorption , but for + 3 to + 9 km / s they claim that the same low intensity features are caused by a shell surrounding the snr , despite the overlapping velocity range .",
    "we believe a more consistent explanation is that all features are caused by absorption .",
    "their fig.24 shows the co emission averaged from + 3 to + 10 km / s : we see no clear association with snr g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "a sharp edge is seen to the co emission near l=79 degrees , from b=0 to 1.5 degrees , but this is more than 1 degree south of the snr .",
    "ladouceur & pineault ( 2008 ) also propose four scenarios for the location of hi of different velocities around or in front of snr g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "however none of the scenarios is consistent with the recent findings of gottschalk et al ( 2012 ) , which show clear evidence for three hi layers , with the 0 to + 8 km / s layer nearest to us and well in front of the cygnus x region and the g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "in section 3.1 we noted the detailed agreement between the absorption spectra for the snr and the @xmath0 cygni nebula . we conclude that they are probably physically associated and at the same distance .",
    "the distance to the @xmath0 cygni nebula is 1.7 to 2.6 kpc ( baars et al . , 1978 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the lower distance limit of 1.5 kpc , derived above .",
    "recently , rygl et al ( 2012 ) have determined accurate distances for five massive star forming regions in the cygnus x region .",
    "four of the five have distances of 1.3 to 1.5 kpc , yielding the best distance yet for the cyg ob2 association , at the center of cygnus x. the fifth region is afgl 2591 , which at @xmath7(j2000)=@xmath34 , @xmath17(j2000)=@xmath35 is located much closer to g78.2 + 2.1 than the others . it has a distance of 3.33@xmath50.11 kpc .",
    "these are similar to the distance to the @xmath0 cygni nebula , but there is not yet a better distance determination to the latter .    in summary ,",
    "we take the distance 1.7 to 2.6 kpc of the @xmath0 cygni nebula as the probable distance for g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "the new x - ray results allow us to determine the snr properties better than previously done .",
    "first we apply a sedov model ( e.g. cox , 1972 ) to g78.2 + 2.1 with distance range 1.7 - 2.6 kpc .",
    "the snr angular radius is 30 arcmin , so with distance @xmath36 kpc the snr radius is @xmath37=17@xmath38pc .",
    "the shock temperature of 0.75 kev is taken from the _ chandra _ spectra of the snr diffuse emission , which has a 90% uncertainty range of 0.6 - 1.2 kev ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this yields a shock velocity of 860 km / s ( 90% error 700 - 1100 km / s ) . including a distance range of 1.7 - 2.6 kpc , the sedov age is 8000 ( 6800,10000 ) yr and the parameter @xmath39 is 7.2 ( 4.4,16 ) , with upper and lower limits in brackets . here",
    "@xmath40 is the blast energy in units of 0.75@xmath41erg .",
    "the norm from the _ rosat _ apec spectral fit for the whole of g78.2 + 2.1 gives an emitting plasma density of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the filling factor in units of 0.05 .",
    "the fiducial filling factor of 0.05 is obtained using the density distribution for a sedov remnant , e.g. as given by heiles ( 1964 ) .",
    "the norm of the _ rosat _ spectral fit also yields a mass of the x - ray emitting plasma of @xmath1 50 m@xmath44 .",
    "we checked , using the _ chandra _ images which resolve point sources , that the contribution of point sources to the _ rosat _ norm is small ( @xmath4520% , so that the _ rosat _ norm is a good approximation to the norm of the diffuse emission from the snr .",
    "the norm then gives an estimate for the pre - shock density , using a compression ratio of 4 for a strong shock , of @xmath46 .",
    "this in turn gives an explosion energy of 0.8(0.5,1.7)@xmath41erg .",
    "finally we test whether the snr is expected to be old enough to be past the sedov ( adiabatic ) phase by calculating @xmath47 , the time at which radiation losses cause the temperature to sag just behind the forward shock ( cox , 1972 ) . with the above parameters we find @xmath47=4.7(4.3,5.4 ) @xmath48 yr , with @xmath49 the radiative cooling coefficient .",
    "thus the sedov age is significantly below the age at which cooling sets in , and the sedov approximation should be a good approximation .",
    "our x - ray spectrum analysis is consistent with the asca results of uchiyama et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who found diffuse plasma temperatures of 0.6 - 0.8 kev , but with the spatial resolution and spectra of the _ chandra _ data , we can separate the emission from the snr from that of compact sources and from that of the foreground x - ray shell . the mavromatakis ( 2003 ) estimate of the column density of @xmath50@xmath13 agrees within errors with that we obtain from the hi absorption spectrum and from the _ chandra _ spectral analysis .    for the compact sources c1 and c2 , the higher resolution _",

    "c1 is an extended hard x - ray source with column density indicating that it is an extragalactic background source .",
    "c2 is a point hard x - ray source with a pure power - law spectrum and has column density consistent with the snr g78.2 + 2.1 , and may be associated with the snr .",
    "the 0.5 - 3 kev chandra image ( fig .",
    "4 ) also shows the location of the @xmath0-ray pulsar psr j2021 + 4026 , which like c2 has a column density consistent with that of the snr , and the error circle of the tev source ver j2019 + 407 .",
    "c2 is outside the 95% error circle of ver j2019 + 407 , so is probably not associated with it .",
    "ver j2019 + 407 is extended ( weinstein et al . 2011 ) and coincides with the rim g78.2 + 2.1 in diffuse radio and x - ray emission , so is likely associated with the snr .",

    "we searched for counterparts to the shell and see diffuse infrared emission coincident with the shell using iras all - sky - survey images .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "7 , with the left panel showing the 60 micron image around g78.2 + 2.1 and the right panel showing the 60 micron image around the northern shell .",
    "we also found an early type star near the shell s center .",
    "the star is v 1685 cyg ( = hip 100289 ) , with coordinates : ( @xmath7(j2000)=@xmath51 , @xmath17(j2000)=@xmath52 ) , or galactic l=78.8719d , b=+02.7699d . from simbad , the apparent v magnitude and b - v color are : v=10.88 , b - v=0.57 .",
    "the spectral type is b3 and its distance is 980 pc ( manoj et al . , 2006 ) , which is consistent with the x - ray column density .",

    "a background spectrum is extracted from an adjacent area just east of the shell .",

    "we tested that a sedov snr model is inconsistent with the northern shell , because it results in an unreasonably small explosion energy .",
    "binney and merrifield , 1998 , give standard parameters for a b3 main sequence star : m= 7.6 m@xmath61 , l=@xmath62l@xmath61 , r=4.8 r@xmath61 , t@xmath63=18700k .",

    "this yields a stellar wind power of @xmath64erg s@xmath15 .",
    "then the observed angular radius and distance give the bubble radius of 8.5 pc .",
    "applying the wind bubble model then gives an age for the bubble of @xmath65yr .",
    "we carry out a new study of the supernova remnant g78.2 + 2.1 using chandra and _ rosat _ x - ray observations and cgps radio continuum and hi line observations .",
    "we find that hi absorption spectra of g78.2 + 2.1 and the @xmath0 cygni nebula are nearly identical , so we associate them at the same distance of 1.7 - 2.6 kpc ( baars et al .",

    "we use the _ chandra _ acis observations , with their superior spatial and spectral resolution , to show that c1 is probably an extragalactic extended source , and that c2 is a point source with a power - law spectrum with the same column density as g78.2 + 2.1 . for the northern x - ray shell , an early - type ( b3 main sequence ) star v1685 cyg , at distance 980 pc , is found at the center of the shell .",
