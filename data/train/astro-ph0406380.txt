    "the hi  parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) is a blind neutral hydrogen survey over the entire sky south of declination @xmath1 .",
    "one of the main objectives of the survey is to extract a sample of hi - selected extragalactic objects , which can be employed to study the local large scale structure and the properties of galaxies in a manner free from optical selection effects . in meyer",
    "et al . ( 2004a , paper i , hereafter ) we present the hipasssample of 4315 hi - selected objects from the region south of declination @xmath2 .",
    "this sample , which we refer to as hicat , forms the largest catalogue of extragalactic hi - selected objects to date . in paper",
    "i the selection procedure of hicatis described in detail , along with a discussion of the global sample properties and a description of the catalogue parameters that have been released to the public .",
    "the scientific potential of hicatis very large , but to make optimal use of the catalogue it is essential that the completeness and reliability are well understood and quantified . only after an accurate assessment of the completeness and reliability",
    "is it possible to extract from the observed sample the intrinsic properties of the local galaxy population .    for optically - selected galaxy samples ,",
    "this procedure is relatively straightforward since most optically - selected galaxy samples are purely flux - limited , possibly complicated by the reduced detection efficiency of objects with low optical surface brightness ( see e.g. , lin et al 1999 , strauss et al .",
    "2002 , norberg et al .",
    "since the hi  21-cm emission of galaxies is localized in a narrow region of velocity space , blind 21-cm surveys need to cover the two spatial dimensions and the velocity dimension simultaneously .",
    "the advantage of this is that the survey yields redshifts simultaneously with the object detections , and follow - up redshift surveys are not required .",
    "however , this extra dimension complicates the detection efficiency .",
    "the ` detectability ' of a 21-cm signal depends not only on the flux , but also on how this flux is distributed over the velocity width of the signal .    in this paper",
    "we take an empirical approach to this problem , and determine the completeness of hicatby the recovery rate of synthetic sources that have been inserted in the data .",
    "the reliability is determined by follow - up observations of a large number of sources .",
    "our aim is to describe in detail the completeness and the reliability of hicatas a function of various catalogue parameters , in such a way that future users can make optimal use of hicatin studies of e.g. , the hi  mass function , the local large scale structure , the tully  fisher relation , etc .",
    "we also discuss in detail the errors on the hicatparameters , determine expressions to estimate errors and estimate what fraction of the error is determined by noise and what fraction by the parametrization .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section  [ hipass.sec ] a brief review of the hipasssurveys is given . in section  [ completeness.sec ] the completeness of hicatis calculated using three independent methods .",
    "section  [ reliability.sec ] details the follow - up observations and the evaluation of the reliability . in section  [ parameter.sec ] errors on hicatparameters are calculated .",
    "the observing strategy and reduction steps of hipassare described in detail in barnes et al .",
    "a full description of the galaxy finding procedure and the source parametrization is given in paper i. here we briefly summarize the hipassspecifics .",
    "the observations were conducted in the period from 1997 to 2000 with the parkes 64-m radio telescope , using the 21-cm multibeam receiver ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "the telescope scanned strips of @xmath6 in declination and data were recorded for thirteen independent beams , each with two polarizations .",
    "a total of 1024 channels over a total bandwidth of 64 mhz were recorded , resulting in a mean channel separation of @xmath7 and a velocity resolution of @xmath8 after tukey smoothing .",
    "the data are additionally hanning smoothed for parameter fitting to improve signal - to - noise , giving a final velocity resolution of @xmath9 .",
    "the total velocity coverage is @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "after bandpass calibration , continuum subtraction and gridding into @xmath12 cubes , the typical root - mean - square ( rms ) noise is @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to a @xmath14 column density limit of @xmath15 per channel for gas filling the beam .",
    "the spatial resolution of the gridded data is @xmath16 .",
    "the basic absolute calibration method used for hipassis described by barnes et al .",
    "the absolute flux scale was determined during the first hipassobservations in february 1997 by calibrating a noise diode against the radio sources hydra a and 1934 - 638 with known amplitudes ( relative to the baars et al .",
    "1977 flux scale ) .",
    "the calibration was checked regularly ( on average three time each year ) by re - observing the two calibration sources . the r.m.s . of the flux measurements",
    "averaged over all 13 beams and two polarizations is 2% , which gives a good indication of the stability of the absolute flux calibration .",
    "two automatic galaxy finding algorithms were applied to the hipassdata set to identify candidate sources . to avoid confusion with the milky way galaxy and high velocity clouds ,",
    "the range @xmath17 was excluded from the list .",
    "the resulting list of potential detections was subjected to a series of independent manual checks .",
    "first , to quickly separate radio frequency interference and bandpass ripples from real hi  sources , two manual checks were done examining the full detection spectra .",
    "detections that were not rejected by both checks were then examined in spectral , position , ra - velocity , and dec - velocity space .",
    "finally , the detections were parametrized interactively using standard miriad ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) routines .",
    "this final catalogue of hi - selected sources is referred to as hicat .",
    "the completeness @xmath18 of a sample is defined as the fraction of sources from the underlying distribution that is detected by the survey . for an hi - selected galaxy sample ,",
    "@xmath18 is dependent on the peak flux , , and the velocity width , @xmath19 , or alternatively on a combination of both .",
    "one way of determining the completeness is through analytical methods .",
    "for example , for the ahiss sample presented in zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , a ` detectability ' parameter was calculated , which depended on the distance of the detection from the center of the beam , the variation of feed gain with frequency , the velocity width , and the integrated flux . the completeness was assumed to be 100 per cent if the detectability @xmath20 , corresponding to the requirement that be larger that 5 times the local rms noise level after optimal smoothing .",
    "this analytically derived detectability was then compared with the survey data and proved to be a satisfactory description of the survey completeness .",
    "rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) used an empirical approach to assess the completeness of their arecibo dual - beam survey ( adbs ) , by inserting a large number of synthetic sources throughout the survey data . by determining the rate at which the synthetic sources could be recovered , they established the completeness , which they expressed as a function of signal - to - noise .    in this paper",
    "we also choose to assess the completeness of the hipasssample by inserting in the data a large number of synthetic sources , prior to running the automatic galaxy finding algorithms ( see paper i ) .",
    "the actual process of source selection is a multi - step process , which is partly automated and partly based on by - eye verification .",
    "it is therefore preferable to study the completeness empirically instead of analytically .",
    "the synthetic sources were constructed to resemble real sources , and were divided into three groups based on their spectral shapes : gaussian , double - horned , and flat - topped .",
    "the sources were not spatially extended .",
    "the velocity width , peak flux , and position of each synthetic source were chosen randomly , and were drawn from a uniform parent distribution that spans the range @xmath21 to @xmath22 in @xmath19 , the range @xmath21 to @xmath23 mjy in , and the range @xmath24 to @xmath25 in velocity .",
    "care was taken not to place synthetic sources on top of real sources .",
    "this was done by using the results of an automatic galaxy finding algorithm that was run prior to the insertion of the synthetic sources .",
    "a total of 1200 synthetic sources were inserted in the hipassdata cubes , with approximately equal numbers of each of the three profile types .    in fig .",
    "[ 2dcompl.fig ] we show a greyscale representation of the completeness of the hipasssample in the @xmath26 plane and in the @xmath27 plane , where  is the peak flux density in jy , @xmath19 is velocity width in , and  is the integrated flux in .",
    "the completeness in these plots is simply determined by calculating @xmath28 , the fraction of fake sources that is recovered in each bin : @xmath29    in order to calculate the completeness as a function of one parameter , we need to integrate along one of the axes , and apply a weighting to account for the varying number of sources in each bin . put differently , the completeness @xmath18 is the number of _ detected _ real sources @xmath30 divided by the total number of _ true _ sources in each bin , which we estimate with @xmath31 .",
    "for example , the completeness as a function of , determined from the @xmath26 matrix is given by @xmath32 this weighting corrects for the fact that the parameter distribution of the synthetic sources might be different from that of the underlying real galaxy distribution .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 can be determined by integrating over , and @xmath34 can be determined by integrating over a @xmath27 matrix .",
    "hereafter , we refer to @xmath18 as the differential completeness since it refers to the completeness at a certain value of , , or @xmath19 .",
    "it is often convenient to calculate the cumulative completeness @xmath35 .",
    "for example , @xmath36 is the completeness for all sources with peak fluxes larger than : @xmath37      fig .",
    "[ completeness.fig ] shows the result of this analysis , the circles show the differential completeness as a function of , @xmath38 , and , and the triangles show the cumulative completeness .",
    "error bars indicate 68 per cent confidence levels and are determined by bootstrap re - sampling synthetic sources , @xmath30 sources are chosen randomly , with replacement .",
    "this is repeated 200 times and for each of these 200 re - generated samples the completeness @xmath39 is calculated following equations 2 and 3 .",
    "the @xmath40 upper and lower errors on the completeness are determined by measuring from the distribution of @xmath39 the 83.5% and 16.5% percentiles ] .",
    "we fit the completeness as a function of and  with error functions ( erf ) , which are indicated by solid lines .",
    "the best - fitting error functions are given in table  [ completeness.tab ] , along with the completeness limits at 95 and 99 per cent .",

    "the completeness is a slowly varying function , which illustrates the complexity of the detectability of hi  signals .",
    "however , all curves reach the 100 per cent completeness level .",
    "this indicates that our source finding algorithms do not miss any high signal - to - noise sources , and our system of checking all potential sources for possible confusion with rfi is sufficiently conservative that it does not cause many false negatives .",
    "although the above derived expressions are useful for understanding the completeness of hicat , they do not allow us to calculate completeness levels for individual sources .",
    "for many purposes , for example in evaluating the hi  mass function , it is convenient to know what the completeness of the catalogue is for a source with specific parameters .",
    "we tested different fitting functions and found that the completeness can be fitted satisfactorily using two parameters : @xmath47 { \\rm erf}[0.36({\\mbox{$s_{\\rm int}$}}-1.1)].\\ ] ] this provides an accurate fit to the completeness matrices shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dcompl.fig ] , and also reproduces the one - parameter fits shown in fig .",
    "[ completeness.fig ] , after the proper summation given eq .",
    "[ compl.eq ] has been applied . in fig .",
    "[ 2ddist.fig ] the 50 , 75 , and 95 per cent completeness limits calculated using eq .  [ complexpr.eq ] are drawn on top of the parameter distribution of the full hicatdata .",
    "the contours in the @xmath26-plane are calculated by assuming @xmath48 , which provides a good fit to the data .",
    "unfortunately , the regions of parameter space that are most densely populated are severely incomplete , as is generally true for samples that do not have a sharp completeness limit . by cutting hicatat the 95 ( 99 ) per cent completeness limit , the sample",
    "is reduced to 2209 ( 1678 ) sources .      among blind extragalactic hi  surveys ,",
    "hipassis unique in the sense that it is fully noise - limited .",
    "surveys such as ahiss or the adbs are partly bandwidth - limited , which means that the brightest galaxies in the sample can only be detected out to the distance limit set by the restricted bandwidth of the receiving system .",
    "since hipassis a relatively shallow survey and was conducted with a large bandwidth ( 64 mhz ) , even the detection of the most hi  massive galaxies is noise - limited .",
    "the distance distribution @xmath49 of hicatgalaxies drops to zero at large distances , before the maximum distance of @xmath50 is reached ( see paper i ) .",
    "this property of hicatenables the use of standard techniques to verify the completeness limits determined in section  [ complresuls.sec ] . for bandwidth - limited samples",
    "these methods would not give meaningful results .",
    "rauzy ( 2001 ) recently suggested a new tool to assess the completeness for a given apparent magnitude in a magnitude - redshift sample .",
    "this method is easily adapted to an hi - selected galaxy sample .",
    "essentially , the method compares the number of galaxies brighter and fainter than every galaxy in the sample . in the case of a homogeneously",
    "distributed sample in space , the method is essentially the same as a @xmath51 test , but by design rauzy s method is insensitive to structure in redshift space .",
    "the method is based on the definition of a random variable @xmath52 , which for a hi - selected sample can be defined as @xmath53},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the cumulative hi  mass function , @xmath55 is a ` distance modulus ' defined as @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the limiting hi  mass at the distance corresponding with @xmath55 .",
    "an unbiased estimate of @xmath52 for object @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of objects with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the number of objects for which @xmath64 and @xmath62 .",
    "the values of @xmath65 should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "now a quantity @xmath66 can be defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the variance of @xmath65 , defined as @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the completeness of the sample can now be estimated by computing @xmath66 on truncated subsamples according to a decreasing .",
    "for statistically complete subsamples the quantity @xmath66 has an expectation value of zero and unity variance .",
    "the completeness limit is found when @xmath66 drops systematically to negative values , where @xmath70 indicates a 97.7 ( 99.4 ) per cent confidence level . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ rauzy.fig ] we plot the result of the @xmath66 completeness test . from this",
    "we derive that the completeness limit of the sample is @xmath71 at the 97.7 per cent confidence level .",
    "this limit is very close to what was found in the previous section , where we calculated the completeness based on the detection rate of synthetic sources .    as a final verification we plot in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ rauzy.fig ] the number of galaxies as a function of .",
    "the dotted line shows a @xmath72 distribution expected for a flux - limited sample , and is scaled vertically so as to fit the right hand side of the curve .",
    "deviations from the curve start to become apparent at @xmath73 , which is consistent with the more accurate determination from the @xmath66 method .",
    "unlike the @xmath66 method , this method of plotting @xmath74 as a function of  is sensitive to the effects of large scale structure .",
    "hipassachieves 100 per cent coverage over the whole southern sky and has a mostly uniform noise level of @xmath75 .",
    "however , in some regions of the sky the noise level is elevated due to the presence of strong radio continuum sources . in fig .",
    "[ noise_on_sky.fig ] the median noise level of every hipasscube is shown .",
    "these noise levels are determined robustly using the estimator @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the median absolute deviation from the median .",
    "this estimator is much less sensitive to outliers than the straight rms calculation , and provides an accurate estimate of the rms of the underlying distribution , provided that this distribution is nearly - normal .",
    "the average cube noise level is elevated more than 10 per cent over just 14.8 per cent of the sky , and elevated more than 20 per cent over 6.2 per cent of the sky .",
    "a region of elevated noise levels can be clearly identified in fig .",
    "[ noise_on_sky.fig ] , where the highest noise values go up to @xmath78 .",
    "this region corresponds very closely to galactic plane , where the strongest radio continuum sources are located and where the density of continuum sources is highest .",
    "it is not straightforward to assess accurately how the completeness is affected by varying noise levels . since a significantly different noise level is only observed over a small region of the sky , the number of synthetic sources in these regions is too small to calculate the completeness limits accurately .",
    "furthermore , the region of highest noise levels coincidently lies in the direction of the local void , where the detection rate of sources is naturally depressed .",
    "therefore , the @xmath66 method , or a simple @xmath51 method are also unreliable estimators of the completeness here . in the absence of empirical estimators , we make the reasonable assumption that the detection efficiency scales linearly with the local noise level , which means that the completeness @xmath79 can be replaced with @xmath80 in regions of atypical noise levels .",
    "this implies that the 95 per cent completeness level , which is normally reached at 71  mjy , is reached at 85  mjy when the noise level is elevated by 20 per cent .",
    "the completeness as a function of @xmath38 is probably not affected by a slight increase in noise level .",
    "the completeness as a function of  is adjusted similar to @xmath79 .      in order to test the detection efficiency of various profile shapes",
    ", the synthetic sources were divided into three groups : gaussian , double - horned , and flat - topped .",
    "we perform the completeness analysis for each of these subsamples individually , and show the results in fig .",
    "[ comp_prof.fig ] . within the errors ,",
    "the detection efficiency as a function of peak flux is independent of profile shape .",
    "however , @xmath81 and @xmath34 are somewhat depressed for double - horned profiles with respect to gaussian and flat - topped profiles .",
    "the reason for this is probably that low signal - to - noise double - horned profiles are easily mistaken for two noise peaks , whereas gaussian and flat - topped profiles have their flux distributed over adjoining channels , which together stand out from the noise more clearly .      in fig .",
    "6 of paper i we show that the velocity distribution of the initial sample of potential hicatdetections shows strong peaks at known rfi frequencies and frequencies corresponding to hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "this might give rise to the concern that the completeness of hicatis suppressed at these frequencies .",
    "however , in paper i we show that the three - dimensional signature of these contaminating signals is sufficiently characteristic that they can be reliably removed from the catalogue .",
    "the final distribution of hicatvelocities shows no features that correlate with rfi or hydrogen radio recombination line frequencies , indicating that the completeness is not significantly affected at these frequencies .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to further substantiate this claim since 1200 uniformly distributed synthetic sources provide insufficient velocity sampling to study the completeness as function of velocity in detail .",
    "the reliability of the sample was determined by re - observing a subsample of sources with the parkes telescope .",
    "the aim of the observations was twofold : assessing the reliability of hicatas a function of peak flux , integrated flux and velocity width , and removing spurious detections from the catalogue .",
    "the subsample was chosen in such a way that the full range of hicatparameters is represented , but preference was given to those detections that have low integrated fluxes .",
    "for every observing session , a sample was created that consisted of randomly chosen hicatdetections , complemented with detections with low ( generally lower than 8  ) . at the time of the observations ,",
    "the observer chose randomly from these samples .",
    "the full range of ra was covered by the observations .",
    "the observations were carried out over five observing sessions between september 2001 and november 2002 .",
    "they were done in narrow - band mode , which gives 1024 channels over 8 mhz , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath82 at @xmath83 . in this narrow - band correlator setting only the inner 7 beams of the multibeam system are available .",
    "an observing mode was used where the target is placed sequentially in each of the 7 beams and a composite off - source spectrum is calculated from the other 6 beams .",
    "this strategy yields a noise level @xmath84 times lower than standard on - off observations in the same amount of time .",
    "typical integration times were 15 min .",
    "the narrow - band observations yield lower rms noise levels than standard broad - band multibeam observations .",
    "furthermore , the high frequency resolution enables better checks of the reality of hicatsources since narrow signals can be detected in several independent channels .",
    "the data were reduced using the aips++ packages livedata and gridzilla ( barnes et al . 2001 ) , and the detections were parametrized using standard miriad routines .    first , we consider the reliability of the original catalogue , before unconfirmed sources have been taken out .",
    "the fraction of sources that was confirmed is defined as @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the number of confirmed and observed sources , respectively .",
    "the reliability as a function of peak flux is the mean of @xmath88 , weighted by the number of sources in each bin : @xmath89 and the cumulative reliability is @xmath90 again , analogous methods can be used to measure @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "[ reliability.fig ] shows the measured reliability as a function of , @xmath38 , and .",
    "the crosses show the differential reliability , error bars indicate 68 per cent confidence levels and are determined by bootstrap re - sampling the data 200 times .    as sources that were re - observed but",
    "not confirmed were taken out of the catalogue , by re - observing a subsample of sources we improve the catalogue reliability . eventually if we were to re - observe all sources the reliability would rise to 100 per cent . to calculate the reliability after taking out unconfirmed sources",
    ", we have to estimate the _ expected _ number of real sources , which is the number of confirmed sources plus @xmath88 times the number of sources that have not been observed .",
    "a final complication arises because a second subsample of sources from hicatwas re - observed as part of a program to measure accurate velocity widths ( meyer et al .",
    "this program also influences the reliability because non - detections were taken out of the catalogue and detections are marked as ` confirmed ' in hicat .",
    "this latter class of sources is indicated as @xmath93 .",
    "now , the expected number of real sources is given by @xmath94 note that the total number of sources in hicat , @xmath30 , excludes all unconfirmed sources .",
    "now , we can redefine @xmath88 as @xmath95 and equations  [ rel.eq ] and [ relcumu.eq ] can be used to calculate the reliability of hicat .",
    "the circles and triangles in fig .",
    "[ reliability.fig ] show the measured differential and cumulative reliability , respectively . in total , 1201 sources were observed , of which 119 were rejected .",
    "the overall reliability is very high ( 95 per cent ) , partly because the catalogue was cleaned up considerably by re - observing many sources and rejecting unconfirmed sources from the catalogue .",
    "the reliability drops significantly below @xmath96  mjy and @xmath97 , and there is possibly a reduced reliability around @xmath98 .",
    "this latter feature may be related to the confusion of real hi  emission signals with ripples in the spectral passband .",

    "this effect , which in zwaan et al .",

    "the error in @xmath38 is not clearly dependent on any other parameter , so we adopt a constant @xmath127 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there appears to be an excess of points which is not satisfactorily fitted with a single gaussian .",
    "these outliers are preferentially those with low peak fluxes , but large velocity widths .",
    "larger uncertainties in the measurements of velocity width occur with broad , low signal - to - noise profiles , because the edges of the profiles can not always be chosen unambiguously .",
    "approximately one - third of the measurements can be fitted with a gaussian with @xmath128 .",
    "we find that the error on recessional velocity is dependent on only , with higher peak flux detections having lower errors on the measured @xmath129 .",

    "the positional accuracy in ra is fitted with @xmath134 , @xmath133 , @xmath135 , and the accuracy in dec is fitted with @xmath136 , @xmath133 , @xmath137 .",
    "these numbers imply that the positional accuracy at the 99 per cent completeness limit is @xmath138 in ra , and @xmath139 in dec .",
    "the difference between these two numbers arises because the hipassdata are more regularly sampled in the dec direction ( see barnes et al .",
    "this positional accuracy agrees very well with the results found from hicatmatching with the 2mass extended source catalogue ( jarret et al .",

    "such measurement are available through our program of parkes narrow - band ( nb ) follow - up observations , which was described in section  [ reliability.sec ] .",
    "these follow - up observations are preferentially targeted at sources with low integrated fluxes , but the sample is sufficiently large to make a meaningful parameter comparison over a large dynamic range .",
    "the nb observations were carried out independently from the hipassprogram and consisted of pointed observations instead of the active scanning used for hipass .",
    "the spectral resolution of the nb observations was 1.65  , compared to 13.2  for hipass , but the data used in this section were smoothed to the hipassresolution .",

    "[ sigma2.eq ] .",
    "here we have adopted @xmath156 , which is the mean rms noise in the follow - up spectra after smoothing these to the hipassresolution .",
    "the converted error estimates provide good fits to the measured scatter , indicating that the equations in table  [ errors.tab ] can be used to find reliable errors on hicatparameters .",
    "we note that the errors on the peak and integrated flux include the uncertainties in the calibration of the flux scale , except for errors in the baars et al .",

    "this comparison is particularly interesting because generally in the parametrization of a 21-cm emission line profile a number of choices are made , which could differ between the persons doing the parametrization .",
    "the biggest uncertainty is probably the fitting and subtracting of the spectral baseline .",
    "structure in the baseline is caused by ringing associated with strong galactic hiemission and continuum emission that can produce standing wave patterns in the telescope structure .",
    "for the bgc , the spectral baselines were fitted with polynomials , of which the order is a free parameter , whereas hicatbaselines were fitted with gaussian smoothing , where the dispersion is a free parameter ( see paper i ) .",
    "another uncertainty is introduced with the choice of the velocity extrema of line profiles , between which the flux is integrated .    in fig .",
    "[ bgcparams.fig ] the comparison with the bgc is shown .",
    "the difference between hicatand bgc parameters is very small .",
    "there are no systematic trends , except for a slight excess of points with high values of @xmath157 at large values of .",
    "this excess arises because hicatand the bgc use different criteria to define what is an extended source .",
    "this leads to more sources in hicatbeing fitted as extended , which generally results in higher values of .",
    "overall , we find that the parametrization error contributes only marginally to the total error , with a contribution of 8 per cent to @xmath141 , 13 per cent to @xmath125 , and 1 per cent to @xmath145 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath147 is not uniquely defined because it depends on , but on average it is 13 per cent .",
    "the rms scatter on the difference between the bgc and hicatvalues of @xmath129 is only @xmath158 at the 99 per cent completeness limit and drops to @xmath159 for brighter sources .",

    "we have addressed in detail the completeness and reliability of the survey .",

    "the overall reliability is 95 per cent , but rises to 99 per cent for sources with peak fluxes @xmath160 or integrated flux @xmath5 .",
    "expressions are derived for the uncertainties on the most important hicatparameters : peak flux , integrated flux , velocity width , and recessional velocity .",
