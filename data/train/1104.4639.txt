    "efficient and selective transfer of population in quantum systems provides an essential tool for a variety of applications in physical chemistry , laser spectroscopy , quantum optics , and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "some of the population transfer techniques make use of the rabi oscillations when the transfer efficiency is controlled by pulse area of the external fields  @xcite .",
    "sensitivity of the final population distribution in the system to the field parameters is sometimes considered as a drawback of these methods .",
    "techniques utilizing adiabatic passage solution in the system dynamics are substantially more robust against moderate variations in the interaction parameters . stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )",
    "is one example of such methods  @xcite .    in a three - level @xmath0 system",
    ", stirap provides a robust scheme for transferring population by using two strong pulses , called the pump and the stokes  @xcite .",
    "when the pump - stokes pulse sequence is arranged in a counterintuitive order ( the stokes pulse precedes the pump pulse ) the system dynamics takes place within a so - called dark state ( a coherent superposition of the initial and the target states ) .",
    "the adiabatic change of the field amplitudes guaranties nearly 100% efficiency of population transfer to the target state while the intermediate state population is negligibly small during whole time evolution .",
    "there are a few modifications of the stirap scheme for more complex configurations of quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "search for an efficient scheme of population transfer is also one of the major goals of optimal control theory ( oct ) , a powerful and sometimes mathematically very sophisticated technique  @xcite .",
    "the oct algorithm has been applied successfully to a broad variety of physical and chemical systems @xcite .",
    "it intrinsically accounts for the quantum - mechanical interference between many pathways connecting initial and target state in a quantum system .",
    "there were some interesting arguments in trying to find a link between oct and stirap . despite initial negative prognosis  @xcite",
    ", it was demonstrated recently that stirap type solution can emerge automatically from global oct method  @xcite .",
    "besides , stirap scheme has been obtained successfully using a local optimal control theory  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we review a performance of the optimal control theory algorithms  @xcite applied for the population transfer and explore their potential to maximize the raman coherence in the three - level @xmath0 system .",
    "our motivation for maximizing coherence is related to the recent developments in coherent anti - stokes raman ( cars ) microscopy and remote detection using intense femto - second laser setups  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , basic equations of the optimal control theory are developed using the method of variational calculus .",
    "field equations are derived using the penalty on the energy of the control field .",
    "a time dependent penalty function is used which ensures experimentally feasible profile of the laser pulses .",
    "a second penalty function is introduced to minimize the population of the excited intermediate state throughout time evolution of the system . in section iii",
    ", we apply the oct formalism to a three - level @xmath0 system and analyze solutions of the oct equations for population transfer and a maximum raman coherence applying different optimization strategies : the conjugate gradient method  @xcite , the zhu - rabitz method  @xcite and the krotov method  @xcite .",
    "section iv is the conclusion .",
    "the oct is based on the definition of a cost functional @xmath1 which must have an optimal value when the desired transformation of the wave function is successfully achieved by the control laser field @xmath2 .",
    "an optimal solution requires that the system wave function at a final time , @xmath3 , should be as close as possible to the target wave function , @xmath4 .",
    "that is the overlap @xmath5 is maximal at final time @xmath6 .    in order to derive control equation for the field and obtain realistic field amplitude",
    "we minimize the energy fluency of the field .",
    "another requirement is that the population of the excited intermediate states has to be minimal throughout the transfer process @xcite , that can be done by defining a projection operator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the eigenket of the unwanted intermediate states .",
    "there is an additional constraint that should be taken into account when we maximize or minimize the cost functional @xmath1 : the wave function @xmath9 must satisfy the schrdinger equation .",
    "these requirements lead to a complete cost functional of the form    @xmath10 ^ 2 - \\beta \\int_0^t dt \\langle \\psi(t)|\\hat{p } | \\psi ( t ) \\rangle % \\nonumber \\\\ -   2 { \\rm re } \\big [ \\int_0^t dt \\big\\langle \\chi ( t ) \\big\\vert \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } + \\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\hat{h } \\big\\vert \\psi ( t ) \\big\\rangle   \\big ] .",

    "the main purpose of @xmath12 is to turn the field on and off smoothly to ensure feasibility of experimental implementation of the optimal laser pulse .",
    "@xmath14 denotes a reference field and @xmath15 is a penalty parameter for the total population of the intermediate state ( or state manifold ) .",

    "( [ eq - k ] ) depends explicitly or implicitly on the unknown driving field .",
    "the goal is to determine an optimal field @xmath2 for which the cost functional has an extremum .",
    "taking variations of the cost functional with respect to @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath2 we find the following set of equations    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    variation of the cost functional with respect to @xmath21 gives the initial condition for the lagrange multiplier @xmath22    equations ( [ initial ] ) and ( [ lagrange ] ) determine the time evolution of the wave function and lagrange multiplier which are used in eq .",

    ", we utilize the oct to create a maximum raman coherence , in other words , the 50/50 coherent superposition of states @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the goal of the first problem at hands is twofold : first , to design the shape and the sequence of the pump and stokes pulses providing a complete population transfer to state @xmath25 ; second to suppress population of the intermediate state during excitation process by applying a penalty on the state population . by doing this",
    "we also would like to determine the efficiency of the methods mentioned above .",
    "for simplicity we restrict our consideration to the exact resonance conditions , @xmath59 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed a performance of several implementation methods of the oct to design optimal pulse sequences for a complete population transfer and the creation of a maximum coherence in a three - level @xmath0 system .",
    "we have applied the conjugate gradient method  @xcite , the zhu - rabitz method  @xcite , and the krotov method  @xcite to obtain the optimal solution .    using the conjugate gradient method",
    "it was demonstrated earlier  @xcite that stirap type solution can emerge automatically from the global oct method .",
    "now we have shown that the zhu - rabitz method  @xcite and the krotov method  @xcite provide an additional conformation that counterintuitive pulse sequence is the optimal solution according to the oct .",
    "it was demonstrated that the penalty on the population of the intermediate state in a three - level system is a crucial factor to obtain the optimal stirap scheme .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the half - stirap scheme is the optimal solution according to the optimal control theory for creation of a maximum coherence .",
    "we have shown that a creation of a maximally coherent superposition is one more optimization problem where the oct finds the adiabatic mechanism as an optimal solution .",
    "note that the related results using oct to create predetermined coherent superposition has been published recently  @xcite . however , the target wave function used in  @xcite was different in comparison to present studies : population of the initially populated state at the later time was zero  @xcite .",
    "as the result , the generalized stirap pulse sequence was found as the optimal solution using the conjugate gradient method  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the optimization procedure reveals the half - stirap pulse sequence as the optimal solution since we require that the half of the population should remain in the initially populated state . comparing the results obtained using the above considered methods",
    ", it is clear that the methods can be applied to various problems on equal footing , since the value of optimized transition probability @xmath60 is more than 99% for all the methods .",
    "however , the value of optimized cost functional @xmath1 calculated using the conjugate gradient method is larger than corresponding values calculated using the zhu - rabitz iterative method and the krotov method for @xmath58 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that the computation cost of the conjugate gradient method is generally larger than that of the other two methods .",
    "one might observe that the pulses in optimal sequence obtained by optimizing the population transfer ( figs.2 - 5 ) and the maximum coherence ( fig.6 ) have a relatively similar structure in all considered implementation schemes .",
    "however , the zhu - rabitz method  @xcite provides the shorter and more intense pulses in comparison to other methods .",
    "there is also a bit more pronounced asymmetry of the pump - pulse shape obtained by the krotov method .",
    "we believe that these differences are due to the variations in the numerical implementation procedure and the values of the penalty parameters .",
    "the conjugate - gradient method  @xcite incorporates one iteration to next iteration feedback from the control field while krotov method  @xcite incorporates one time step to next time step feedback of the control field , and zhu - rabitz method  @xcite incorporates feedback from the control field in an entangled fashion  @xcite , mixing up both feedback techniques .",
