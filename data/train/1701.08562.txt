    "in this paper we study numerical integration of twice differentiable functions defined over a triangle @xmath4 . for an integrable function @xmath5 , we denote the true normalized integral of @xmath6 by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the lebesgue measure of @xmath9 . as an approximation of @xmath10",
    ", we consider a linear algorithm of the form @xmath11 for an @xmath12-element point set @xmath13 and a set of real - valued weights @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , a quasi - monte carlo ( qmc ) integration is an equal - weight quadrature rule where the weights sum up to 1 , i.e. , a linear algorithm with the special choice @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 is simply approximated by @xmath17 if an infinite sequence of points @xmath18 is given , the first @xmath12 elements of @xmath19 are used as @xmath20 .",
    "we define the norm in @xmath21 by @xmath22 and study the worst - case absolute error over the unit ball of @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath23 thus an obvious goal in this context is to construct a good point set or sequence in @xmath9 such that the quantity @xmath24 is small either for some @xmath12 or uniformly for all @xmath1 .",
    "the theory of qmc integration has been developed in depth with the particular focus on approximating the integral of functions defined over the unit cube @xmath25^s$ ] , see for instance @xcite .",
    "in fact , not much attention has been paid to qmc integration over non - cubical domains until recently .",
    "we have to point out , however , that many practical problems are not necessarily given by quadrature over the unit cube .",
    "so far , the most standard approach to qmc integration over a non - cubical domain @xmath26 is to find a uniformity - preserving transformation @xmath27^s\\to \\omega$ ] and then to approximate the normalized integral of @xmath28 by @xmath29 for @xmath30^s$ ] . in the literature , fang and",
    "wang @xcite introduced several transformations from the unit cube to the ball , sphere , and simplex .",
    "pillards and cools @xcite studied 5 different transformations from the unit cube to the simplex .",
    "more recently , basu and owen @xcite gave sufficient conditions on @xmath31 so that @xmath32 is either of bounded variation or satisfies additional smoothness conditions .    instead of applying a uniformity - preserving transformation , more direct and explicit constructions of point sets and sequences in a triangular domain @xmath9",
    "have been introduced recently by basu and owen @xcite .",
    "one is based on the van der corput sequence in base 4 in conjunction with a recursive partitioning of @xmath9 .",
    "the other is given by a rotation of an integer lattice through an angle whose tangent is badly approximable .",
    "a discrepancy measure derived in @xcite was employed as a quality criterion of these constructions , and it was shown that the latter one attains a lower discrepancy .",
    "nonetheless , the former one is of practical importance since it is extensible and can be randomized .    in this paper , motivated by the first construction of basu and owen",
    ", we study qmc integration for smooth functions in @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we give an explicit construction of infinite sequences of points including one by basu and owen as a special case , and prove that our quadrature rule achieves the worst - case error of order @xmath0 for any @xmath1 in @xmath21 .",
    "the main result of this paper can be summarized as follows :    [ thm : main ] for a triangle @xmath4 , we can explicitly construct an infinite sequence @xmath19 of points in @xmath9 for which there exists a constant @xmath33 such that @xmath34 for all @xmath1 , and in particular , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "roughly speaking , our approach for the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] is to exploit the decay of the walsh coefficients for @xmath37 under a suitable recursive partitioning of @xmath9 . by following the essentially same argument using bump functions as in @xcite ,",
    "see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2.7 ) , we see that a lower bound of order @xmath2 on the worst - case error holds for any linear algorithm in @xmath21 .",
    "namely , there exists a constant @xmath38 such that @xmath39 holds for any choice of @xmath20 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus the upper bound we obtain is best possible apart from the @xmath3 factor .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present an explicit construction of infinite sequences of points in @xmath9 .",
    "we prove an upper bound on the worst - case error for our quadrature rule in section  [ sec : upper ] , whereas the result on the decay of the walsh coefficients for @xmath37 , which is necessary for the proof of an upper bound , is shown later in section  [ sec : walsh ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the following notations .",
    "let @xmath41 be the set of integers , @xmath42 the set of positive integers , and @xmath43 .",
    "we denote the two - element field by @xmath44 , which is identified with the set @xmath45 equipped with addition and multiplication modulo 2 . the addition operation in @xmath44 is denoted by @xmath46 , and in case of vectors or matrices over @xmath44 , @xmath46 is applied componentwise .",
    "further we denote a triangular domain with vertices @xmath47 by @xmath48 and the diameter of a set @xmath49 by @xmath50 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that the center of a triangle @xmath9 is located at the origin in @xmath51 , i.e. , if the center of @xmath9 is not located at the origin , it suffices to shift the whole domain @xmath9 .",
    "in a similar way to ( * ? ? ? * section  3 ) , here we introduce a recursive partitioning of a triangle @xmath52 .",
    "we first partition the triangle into 4 congruent subtriangles , to each of which a pair @xmath53 is assigned with @xmath54 in the center",
    ". then we partition each subtriangle into 4 congruent sub - subtriangles , to each of which a pair @xmath55 is assigned again with @xmath54 in the center .",
    "hence every sub - subtriangle can be now identified with a set of pairs @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : partition ] .",
    "it is obvious that this recursive partitioning of the triangle defines the mapping from @xmath58 to @xmath9 , which is surjective but not injective .",
    "moreover , for a matrix @xmath59 with @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , the first @xmath16 rows of @xmath62 determines which of @xmath63 congruent subregions the matrix @xmath62 is mapped within , and from the condition that the pair @xmath54 is always assigned in the center , we see that the matrix @xmath62 is mapped to the center of the corresponding subregion .",
    ".,width=340 ]    we now describe our recursive partitioning more precisely .",
    "the subtriangle of @xmath52 for a pair @xmath53 is defined by @xmath64 then the sub - subtriangle for a set of pairs @xmath56 and @xmath57 is defined by @xmath65 in this way , the subregion for a matrix @xmath66 with some @xmath67 is defined recursively by @xmath68 for simplicity of notation , as long as @xmath69 , we write @xmath70 moreover we define the mapping @xmath71 by @xmath72 and , again for simplicity of notation , as long as @xmath73 we write @xmath74    regarding the map @xmath75 we have the following lemma . since the result can be easily proved by induction on @xmath76 , we omit the proof .

    "define @xmath86 by @xmath87 then we have @xmath88 .",
    "in particular @xmath89      we describe how to generate an infinite sequence of points in a triangle @xmath9 . for this purpose",

    "then we call the subset @xmath99 a ( two - dimensional ) digital net over @xmath44 with generating matrices @xmath100 .    by using the map @xmath101 defined by @xmath102 for @xmath103 , digital nets over @xmath44 are usually defined as point sets in @xmath104 by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is applied columnwise . here",
    "we see that the integer @xmath16 denotes the precision of points . in this paper , it is more reasonable to define digital nets over @xmath44 as subsets in @xmath107 instead of point sets in @xmath104 .",
    "the above definition can be extended to digital sequences over @xmath44 .",
    "[ def : digital_seq ] let @xmath108 .",

    "furthermore , for @xmath36 , the first @xmath119 elements of @xmath19 can be regarded as a digital net over @xmath44 with generating matrices @xmath120 for some @xmath91 , where we denote by @xmath121 the left upper @xmath122 sub - matrix of @xmath123 .",

    "it is clear from this definition that our infinite sequence of points is determined by generating matrices @xmath100 .",
    "thus we need some quality measure for generating matrices to make an explicit construction of @xmath127 possible , which is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we first recall the notion of dual net .",
    "[ def : dual ] for @xmath90 with @xmath91 , let @xmath128 a digital net over @xmath44 with generating matrices @xmath92 .",

    "a similar abuse of notation is also done in case of a matrix @xmath142 for finite @xmath16 .    for a digital net @xmath128",

    "any digital net satisfies the above inequality for @xmath150 . in practice , we prefer a larger value of @xmath151 and thus equivalently a smaller value of @xmath147 , and @xmath152 is best possible .",
