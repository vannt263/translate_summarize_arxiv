    "then , we proceed to study the propagation of classical electromagnetic fields through binary lattices of infinite size by use of coupled mode theory for lattices with alternating self - energy and by an operator approach to floquet - bloch theory in the case of an array with alternating couplings . in",
    "we use coupled mode theory ( with a twist given by the use of orthogonal polynomials ) to solve a finite binary self - energies lattice in order to exemplify how the presented methods are valid , changing what needs to be changed , in all cases . in this section",
    "we also find the dynamics of a finite binary couplings array by basic matrix theory methods .",
    "curiously , we find that the dynamics for both finite size binary lattices can be written in terms of fibonacci polynomials evaluated at the roots of a fibonacci polynomial which order is related to the size of the system . in we introduce some quantities of interest when studying photon transport in arrays of photonic waveguides .",

    "a binary photonic super - lattice is composed by the repetition of a primitive unit cell where two different elements are characterized by one parameter .",
    "one type of such binary waveguide arrays , shown in ( a ) , is composed by identical waveguides where nearest neighbour coupling between them alternates between two values ; hereby , we will refer to this type as binary coupling ( bc ) lattice . in the other type , shown in ( b ) , waveguides with two different refraction indexes alternate position and are homogeneously coupled ; which we will call binary index ( bi ) lattice from here on .",
    "the propagation of a classical light field in an infinite bc lattice is ruled by the scalar differential equation set for the field amplitude at the @xmath0th waveguide , @xmath1 where the constant @xmath2 is the refraction index of each waveguide and a total coupling has been defined as @xmath3 with the difference as @xmath4 .",

    "it is possible to borrow from condensed matter theory a floquet - bloch result for quasiparticle motion on a chain in order to solve the evolution of a classical field , or a single photon , through these lattices  @xcite ; _ e.g. _ , the dispersion relation for a bc lattice , shown in ( a ) , @xmath13,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] results of the infinite bc lattice has been used to discuss the existence of two propagation modes with opposite transverse velocities  @xcite . for a bi lattice",
