    "one of the most active areas in the condensed matter physics is the search for new methods which could capture essential features of electron correlations and disorder in a controllable manner .",
    "perhaps the most successful and widely used methods are the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite and the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite both these methods are exact in infinite dimensions . however , at finite dimensions they neglect nonlocal correlations .",
    "this limitation has raised interests in developing of quantum cluster methods which could capture nonlocal correlations .",
    "the most successful of self consistent quantum cluster methods are the molecular coherent potential approximation ( mcpa ) for disorder systems,@xcite and the cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft)@xcite and the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite for correlated electron systems . in these quantum cluster theories",
    "the system lattice is split into a series of clusters .",
    "both local and nonlocal correlations within the clusters are treated exactly , whereas the nonlocal correlations between different clusters are treated in a mean - field approximation .",
    "the mean field is taken into account by mapping the lattice problem onto a self - consistent effective cluster problem .",
    "the mcpa and cdmft are formulated on the real space , and share a common microscopic definition . within the cdmft ( or the mcpa ) the cluster green function",
    "is calculated with open boundary conditions .",
    "the dca is traditionally formulated in the reciprocal space .",
    "it is based on the idea of discretizing irreducible quantities on the reciprocal space . within the dca the cluster green function",
    "is calculated with periodic boundary conditions . due to the difference of boundary conditions it seems that the dca and the cdmft ( or the mcpa ) have different microscopic definitions .",
    "for instance , the cdmft can be formulated within the self - energy functional approach , whereas it seems that the dca can not be.@xcite there is also a view of the dca in the real space representation which shows a relation between the dca and cdmft.@xcite the view is based on an unitary transformation of the hopping matrix .",
    "however , the interaction part still remains unchanged . in this paper",
    "we show that the dca and the cdmft share a common microscopic definition through a canonical transformation .",
    "the canonical transformation is similar to the unitary transformation which was used to view the dca in the real space .",
    "it periodizes the fermions in the cluster space , that the cluster green function has periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we apply the canonical transformation to the whole hamiltonian , and in the presence of a constrain which prevents the umklapp momentum transfer from the superlattice to the cluster space we obtain a periodized hamiltonian .",
    "the umklapp momentum transfer appears when the sum of two momenta of the superlattice is beyond the first brillouin zone , and is solely due to the imaginary superlattice construction of clusters with periodic boundary conditions . within the periodized hamiltonian",
    "the dca can be derived from the cdmft . in the such way",
    ", the dca and the cdmft can be unified into a common microscopic background .",
    "the derivation also gives the microscopic background of the discretization of irreducible quantities on the reciprocal space , and clarifies the approximation nature of the dca .",
    "the present paper consists of two parts . in the first part",
    "a derivation of the dca from the cdmft through the canonical transformation for fermions is presented .",
    "the second part is concerned with the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt).@xcite the cpt is also a quantum cluster approach . however , in difference with the cdmft or the dca , the cpt does not have the self consistency .",
    "the cpt can be viewed as the first term of a systematic expansion around strong coupling . however , within the cpt the cluster green function is calculated with open boundary conditions , that the wave vector within a cluster is no longer a conserved quantum number .",
    "there are also several approaches which generate periodic boundary conditions for the cpt .",
    "one is to add appropriate hopping terms and then subtract them within strong coupling perturbation theory.@xcite however , this approach give results which are less accurate than the ones from open boundary conditions.@xcite the other approach adapts the periodicity of the clusters from the dca .",
    "it was used to study the ising model.@xcite in this paper we present the periodic cluster perturbation theory for fermion systems . the periodic cluster perturbation theory ( pcpt )",
    "is the cpt formulated for the periodized fermions which are obtained after making the canonical transformation .",
    "the pcpt has truly the small parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the cluster linear size .",
    "it turns out that the pcpt converges quadratically in @xmath3 , whereas the cpt converges linearly in @xmath3 .",
    "this is also tested on the study of an exact solvable model .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the canonical transformation which transforms the original fermions onto periodized ones . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the dca from the cdmft after making the canonical transformation .",
    "the pcpt is presented in sec .",
    "iv . in this section",
    "we also study an exact solvable model in both the direct and periodized forms .",
    "finally , the conclusion and remarks are presented in sec .",
    "we present a periodization for fermions through a canonical transformation of fermionic operators . for an illustration a fairly general model of correlated electron systems",
    "is considered .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",

    "the number of lattice sites inside a cluster thus is @xmath16 .",
    "the set of the clusters form a superlattice .",

    "the fermion created by @xmath60 is periodic in both the superlattice and cluster spaces . due to the periodic property",
    "we call @xmath59 , @xmath60 the periodized fermion operators .",
    "the periodicity allows to perform the fourier transformation of @xmath59 , @xmath60 in the superlattice and cluster spaces @xmath63 we want to emphasise here that both @xmath24 and @xmath30 should be restricted to the first brillouin zones of the superlattice and cluster spaces . from eqs .",
    "( [ t4a])-([t4b ] ) we obtain immediately @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "however , these relations are valid only for momenta in the first brillouin zones .",
    "thus , from the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) we obtain @xmath66 note that in hamiltonian ( [ hpn ] ) all sums over momenta are restricted to the first brillouin zones .",
    "moreover , when @xmath67 and @xmath68 are beyond the first brillouin zone , one has to translate them back to the first brillouin zone , thus the momentum sums still are over the full first brillouin zone .",
    "equivalently , the momenta of the periodized fermion operators take values @xmath69 . in deriving the hamiltonian ( [ hpn ] )",
    "we have used the following restriction @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 are arbitrary momenta which are either zero or a vector of the reciprocal superlattice space .",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 are also the momenta of the reciprocal cluster space .",
    "@xmath73 just means an umklapp process on the superlattice , and @xmath72 can be interpreted as a momentum transfered by the umklapp process from the superlattice to the cluster space .",
    "the first line of eq .",
    "( [ const ] ) is exact , while the second line is a particular restriction .",
    "this restriction prevents the momentum transfer in the umklapp processes of the superlattice .",
    "the umklapp processes appear when the sum of two momenta of the superlattice is beyond the first brillouin zone , and they transfer a momentum modulo a vector of the reciprocal superlattice to the reciprocal cluster space that generate a momentum nonconservation .",
    "however , the such momentum transfer is unphysical , it is solely due to the imaginary discretization of the original lattice into superlattice of clusters with periodic boundary conditions . in order to maintain the correct physics",
    ", one has to impose a constrain which forbids the umklapp momentum transfer on the superlattice . the restriction ( [ const ] )",
    "is the constrain of the superlattice construction .",
    "as we will see later on an example of exact solvable model , the constrain indeed leads the periodized hamiltonian ( [ hpn ] ) to the exact solution . performing the fourier transformation ( [ t4ia])-([t4ib ] ) , from the hamiltonian ( [ hpn ] ) we obtain @xmath74 where the hopping integral and interaction of the periodized fermions now are @xmath75 one can notice that @xmath76 , @xmath77 are cyclic in the indexes @xmath26 , @xmath27 , whereas @xmath78 , @xmath79 are not .",

    "( [ hop])-([int ] ) that @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",

    "are quite different from the original hopping and interaction , respectively .",
    "they may connect those lattice sites that the original ones do not .",
    "for instance , if the original hopping is nearest neighbor then the hopping only couples the nearest neighbor sites either within the clusters , or on the cluster boundaries of the nearest neighbor clusters .",
    "however , in the same case the periodized hopping can couple a lattice site with any other lattice site .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is adequate to quantum cluster methods with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "originally , the dca is formulated in the reciprocal space.@xcite it is based on the idea of discretizing irreducible quantities on the reciprocal space . later , the dca was also viewed in the real space by introducing an unitary transformation for the hopping matrix.@xcite however , in this view only the hopping term is transformed , whereas the interaction term remains unchanged . as a consequence ,",
    "the hopping and interaction terms are not treated on an equal footing .",
    "it correctly recovers the dca only for a local single - site interaction . in the presented approach both the hopping and interaction terms",
    "are treated on an equal footing .",
    "it also clarifies why within the dca the lattice quantities , for instance the hopping term in the lattice green function ( eq .  ( [ hopdca ] ) ) , are unchanged , whereas the cluster quantities , for instance the cluster interactions ( eq .  ( [ ueff ] ) ) , are discretized or coarse grained .",
    "thus , the dca can be used in both the reciprocal and real spaces . in the real space",
