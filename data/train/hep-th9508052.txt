    "the quantum to classical transition @xcite is a very old and interesting problem relevant in many branches of physics .",
    "it involves the concepts of _ correlations _ , i.e. the wigner function of the quantum system should have a peak at the classical trajectories , and _ decoherence _ , that is , there should be no interference between classical trajectories . the density matrix should be diagonal . in order to understand the emergence of classical behavior , it is essential to consider the interaction of the system with its environment @xcite , since both the loss of quantum coherence and the onset of classical correlations depend strongly on this interaction @xcite .    in the last years , there has been a renewed interest in the study of this transition in the context of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the efforts are directed to explain the emergence of a classical space - time metric from a full quantum theory , and to derive the einstein equations , or the quantum - corrected version of them .",
    "the relevance of statistical and quantum effects such as noise , dissipation , particle creation , back - reaction , etc , have been subsequently elucidated in the context of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the quantum to classical transition is also of interest in the standard cosmology . according to the inflationary theory ,",
    "quantum fluctuations of matter fields are the origin of very small inhomogeneities which gave rise to the formation of structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "a crucial assumption in this scenario is that quantum fluctuations become classical as their wavelength become larger than the hubble radius @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , a detailed analysis of this classical to quantum transition is needed in order to complete our understanding of the mechanism of structure - formation",
    ".    there has been several attempts in order to prove the previously mentioned assumption . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem has been analyzed using a toy model which consists of two massless fields interacting through a mixing of the kinetic terms .",
    "similar theories involving interactions with mass mixing terms have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all these models ,",
    "the interaction terms are quadratic and disappear after a redefinition of the fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same problem has been studied in a theory consisting of two scalar fields with a biquadratic interaction .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the emergence of classical inhomogeneities from quantum fluctuations in a more realistic model . to begin with",
    ", we will consider a @xmath0 theory in minkowski spacetime .",
    "following starobinsky s original suggestion for the stochastic inflationary model@xcite , we will split the scalar field into two parts : the _ system _ @xmath2 containing the field modes whose wavelengths are longer than certain fixed cutoff ( @xmath3 ) , and the _ environment _ @xmath4 which contains the modes with wavelengths shorter than the cutoff . although this splitting will cause some technical difficulties , we will see that it is possible to study and prove the assertion that quantum fluctuations with wavelengths longer than @xmath3 decohere due to the interaction with the environment .",
    "moreover , it will be also possible to extend the results to curved spaces . for a conformally",
    "coupled scalar field in a desitter spacetime , we will show that starobinsky s splitting between system and environment is the most adequate in the following sense : the minimum value for the critical wavelength such that the system looses coherence is @xmath5 . for shorter critical wavelengths there are modes in the system that do not decohere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the relation between the reduced density matrix for the system and the feynman - vernon influence functional @xcite .",
    "we integrate the environment degrees of freedom and compute this functional perturbatively in @xmath6 , for an arbitrary critical wavelength @xmath3 . in section 3 , we compute the propagator for the reduced density matrix and indicate the procedure to obtain the master equation . in particular we compute the diffusion coefficients , since they give the main contribution to the decoherence .",
    "section 4 contains the analysis of the loss of coherence produced by each diffusion coefficient , with particular emphasis on the cutoff - dependence of the results .",
    "we also extend the results to the case of a conformally coupled scalar field in desitter spacetime , and discuss whether the choice @xmath7 is relevant or not .",
    "section 5 contains our final remarks .",

    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath114 is associated to the interaction term @xmath128 .",
    "we are considering only one fourier mode for the system , with wavevector @xmath129 .",
    "the environment field enters linearly in the interaction term , and contains only modes with @xmath130 ( by definition ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath2 is only coupled with the @xmath131 mode of the environment .",
    "this implies that @xmath114 is different from zero only if @xmath132 . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the temporal evolution of @xmath133 .",
    "the diffusive effects increase with time as @xmath134 ( of course our perturbative calculations are not valid at large times ) .",
    "the shape of the curve depends on @xmath135 and takes its maximum value for @xmath136 . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath133 as a function of @xmath135 for a fixed time .",
    "it is interesting to note that we would obtain a similar diffussion coefficient in a particular qbm , with interaction @xmath137 and spectral density @xmath138 .",
    "let us now consider the coefficient @xmath115 coming from the interaction term @xmath139 . as the interaction is now quadratic in @xmath4 , there are no restrictions on the values of @xmath135 such that @xmath140 . in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the temporal evolution of this coefficient for several values of @xmath141 ( the variable @xmath142 labels the different curves ) .",
    "although formally the diffusion coefficients should vanish at @xmath143 ( see eq .",
    "( [ d2prev ] ) ) , the graph shows an initial jolt for all values of @xmath142 .",
    "the origin of this behavior is the uncorrelated initial condition eq.([sincorr ] ) .",
    "we have assumed that the interaction between the system and the environment is turned on instantaneously at @xmath143 . ",
    "instantaneously \" means in a time scale shorter than all time scales present in the system and environment .",
    "therefore , this initial condition assumes implicitly the existence of an ultraviolet cutoff for the frequencies in the environment .",
    "had we considered such cutoff @xmath144 , @xmath115 would have vanished at @xmath143 and developed a peak at @xmath145 .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the qbm @xcite . in order to avoid this cutoff",
    ", one should consider a situation where the interaction is turned on adiabatically .",
    "3 shows that , after the ( probably unphysical ) jolt , the diffusive effects grow with @xmath142 , and are maximum for @xmath146 .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the decoherence increases when the frequency of the system is large enough to excite the environment",
    ".    figs .",
    "4 and 5 show the dependence of @xmath115 with @xmath135 , at a fixed time . for large values of @xmath147 @xmath148",
    ", the environment contains only very high frequencies and the diffusion coefficient is very small unless @xmath149 ( fig .",
    "when @xmath150 , @xmath115 is appreciably different from zero for all modes inside the system , i.e. , the environment is able to produce decoherence for @xmath151 ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath152 @xmath153 approaches a non vanishing value in the limit @xmath154 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a similar analysis is done for two independent fields @xmath155 and @xmath156 coupled through a biquadratic interaction @xmath157 . in that case , one can show that the diffusive effects are more important in the infrared . in our case",
    ", the analysis of the coefficients @xmath114 and @xmath115 shows that the loss of coherence is more important for @xmath158 rather than in the infrared .",
    "after this long journey , we now turn to the issue of cosmological perturbations .",
    "the results of section 3 can be easily generalized to the case of a conformally coupled scalar field in a robertson walker spacetime .",
    "the expressions for the diffusion coefficients @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the same as those for minkowski space eqns .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) , with the replacement @xmath159 . here @xmath160 is the scale factor of the robertson walker metric and @xmath161 is the conformal time . for the particular case of a desitter spacetime",
    "we have @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , the dimensionless quantities @xmath164 and @xmath165 in eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) become @xmath166 and @xmath167 respectively . as @xmath168 , @xmath38 and @xmath135 are the physical values of the cutoff and wavevector at the initial time .",
    "now we can ask the following question : which is the maximum value of the cutoff @xmath38 such that , a few e - foldings after the initial time , all modes with @xmath169 still suffer the diffusive effects ?",
    "the analysis of the diffusion coefficients in minkowski spacetime shows that @xmath114 is very small for @xmath170 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . a similar thing happens for @xmath115 : if @xmath170 this coefficient is very small in the infrared sector , and the diffusive effects are relevant only for @xmath149 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . as in desitter spacetime",
    "we have @xmath171 , we conclude that we can include in our system only those modes with wavelength larger than the horizon @xmath1 .",
    "this is starobinsky s original suggestion .",
    "if we include wavelengths shorter than the horizon , the low frequency sector of the system can not excite the environment and does not decohere .",
    "our results do not apply directly to the inflationary models , since our scalar field is conformally coupled to the curvature .",
    "a more realistic model should contain a minimally coupled scalar field . moreover , the cutoff should be time dependent @xcite since the system should contain , at each time , the modes with @xmath172 . in spite of this ,",
    "we think that this example illustrates the main aspects of the problem .",
    "let us summarize the new results contained in this paper .",
    "after the integration of the high frequency modes in section 2 , we obtained the cgea for the low energy modes . from the imaginary part of the cgea we obtained , in section 3 , the diffusion coefficients of the master equation .",
    "similar calculations have been done previously @xcite considering two scalar fields as system and environment . here",
    "the system and environment are two sectors of a single scalar field , and the results depend on the  size \" of these sectors , which is fixed by the critical wavelength @xmath3 .    in section 4",
    "we analyzed the @xmath38-dependence of the diffusion coefficients .",
    "we showed that the decoherence is larger for those modes in the system whose wavelength is close to the critical value .",
    "we also generalized the results to desitter spacetime and showed that , when the critical wavelength is equal to the horizon size , all modes in the system suffer decoherence and may become classical .    to end this paper , we would like to point out an interesting connection between our work , the renormalization group and the block - spin transformation .",
    "the cgea of section 2 is similar to the  average effective action \" ( aea ) proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs @xcite ) .",
    "the aea is an effective action for averages of the field over a finite space - time volume in euclidean space .",
    "it is defined through a splitting similar to the one used in this paper , but now with a critical _ euclidean _ four - momentum @xmath173 , where @xmath3 is the typical size of the euclidean average volume .",
    "the aea interpolates between the classical action ( @xmath174 ) and the usual effective action ( @xmath175 ) , and realizes the block- spin transformation @xcite in the continuum limit .",
    "it is possible to write an exact evolution equation for the dependence of the aea with the scale @xmath38 .",
    "this equation was originally discussed by wegner and houghton @xcite , and by polchinsky @xcite in his proof of renormalizability of @xmath0- theory .",
    "it can be used as the starting point for non perturbative calculations in quantum field theory .",
    "the cgea we found in this paper can be seen as the close time path version ( as opposed to euclidean version ) of the aea , where the field averages are taken over 3-volumes contained in @xmath176 surfaces .",
    "here we evaluated the cgea perturbatively .",
    "however , it is possible to write an exact equation for the dependence of the cgea on the critical wavelength . this evolution equation could be the starting point for non perturbative evaluations of the influence functional .",
