    "little or no diffuse x - ray emission is detected for the majority of the groups , indicating that these groups are not virialized and are most likely collapsing for the first time .",
    "two groups mz 9014 and mz 4577 have some detected diffuse emission , but at very low luminosities ( @xmath35 erg s@xmath19 ; rasmussen et al .",
    "the mz 10451 group is x - ray luminous ( l@xmath36 @xmath37 erg s@xmath19 ) , suggesting it is more dynamically evolved than the other groups .",
    "the _ wavdetect _ task in sas was used to identify x - ray sources in the fields with a detection threshold of 5 sigma .",
    "source detection was run on both the broad ( @xmath38 kev ) and hard ( @xmath39 kev ) band images .",
    "the x - ray detection limit for each group was calculated assuming a power - law model with index @xmath40 and galactic absorption ( see table [ table : group ] ) .",
    "the x - ray images and source lists were compared with the list of group members to identify possible matches .",
    "for the hard band images , there are two matches ( one in mz 5383 and the other in the x - ray luminous group mz 10451 ) .",
    "the x - ray source in mz 5383 is extended and has a spectrum that is well - fit by a thermal plasma model .",
    "hence , this object is not an x - ray agn .",
    "the detected galaxy in the mz 10451 group is a point source with a very hard x - ray spectrum and a luminosity of @xmath41 erg s@xmath19 ( in the @xmath42 kev band ) .",
    "these characteristics suggest this object is an x - ray agn .",
    "the host galaxy is an elliptical and there are no obvious agn emission - line signatures in the optical spectrum .",
    "therefore , the properties of this source are similar to the x - ray agn found in rich clusters by martini et al .",
    "a few additional matches to group members are found in the broad - band images , but x - ray spectral analysis indicates that all of these are well - described by a thermal plasma model and thus are unlikely to be agn .",
    "in addition , none of the five optical agn are detected in the x - ray images .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that agn selected by their emission line spectra are often x - ray weak in contrast to agn selected by their blue / uv excess ( risaliti et al .",
    "although large absorbing columns might be responsible for the non - detection of these agn in x - rays ( particularly for the edge - on galaxies ) , spectral analysis of a sample of emission - line selected agn suggests that most of them are intrinsically x - ray weak ( risaliti et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the optical / x - ray properties of the agn in our groups are quite different from those in rich clusters .",
    "the agn population in clusters is dominated by x - ray bright agn without strong optical emission lines ( martini et al .",
    "the majority of these agn occur in early - type galaxies .",
    "the one x - ray agn in our sample also occurs in an early - type galaxy and is a member of the only x - ray luminous group . in many ways ,",
    "such x - ray luminous groups can be thought of as mini - clusters  ( cf .",
    "mulchaey 2000 ) , so the presence of x - ray agn in this group is perhaps not too surprising .",
    "however , x - ray bright , optically dull agn are entirely absent from the less dynamically evolved groups in our sample .",
    "it is worth noting that the overall agn fraction in our groups is consistent with the fraction in cluster of galaxies ( @xmath23 7% in our group sample vs @xmath43 in clusters down to the same limiting magnitude of @xmath21 ; martini et al .",
    "therefore , it is not the fraction of agn that varies significantly between these two environments , but the nature of the agn populations : groups are dominated by agn with prominent optical emission lines , while clusters are dominated by x - ray luminous , optically - dull agn .",
    "it is interesting to consider how the differences in the agn populations in poor groups and rich clusters might reflect differences in the galaxy populations in these two environments .",
    "as the agn in our groups occur in late - type galaxies that are likely encountering the group environment for the first time , their host galaxies should retain large reservoirs of gas .",
    "in contrast , cluster hosts are mostly early - type galaxies that are largely void of gas and dust .",
    "therefore , the differences in the agn types in groups and clusters may reflect differences in agn accretion rates in these two environments .",
    "furthermore , since the galaxy population in clusters is older than in groups , the differences in the nature of agn in the two environments may also represent an evolutionary effect . in the following section we combine these two ideas to show how an evolving accretion rate can explain not only our group observations , but many properties of optically and x - ray selected agn in general .",
    "the notion of an evolving accretion rate for agn has been considered recently by several authors ( yu , lu & kauffmann 2005 ; cao 2005 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    ", we propose a simple scenario in which an evolving accretion rate leads to changes in the accretion state of the central smbh and therefore changes in the observed agn properties .    in this picture",
    ", an agn evolves through two major stages during its lifetime .",
    "the first stage is initiated after agn activity is triggered by ( major and/or minor ) galaxy merging . during this stage ,",
    "the accretion rate is high ( probably near the eddington rate ) since there is plenty of fuel provided by the merger ; the accretion occurs via a thin @xmath44 disk ( e.g. frank , king & raine 2002 ) and most of the luminosity is emitted in the uv / optical band with a high radiative efficiency ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the ionization flux from the accretion disk leads to prominent emission - line regions .",
    "the smbh is expected to assemble much of its mass during this early phase ( sotan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "observational constraints suggest this uv / optical dominant phase typically lasts @xmath46 yr ( e.g , martini 2004 ) .",
    "as gas is consumed , the accretion rate decreases , eventually leading to a change of accretion state from thin disk accretion to a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf , e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; armitage 2004).the bolometric luminosity is lower during this second phase due to both the lower accretion rate and the lower radiative efficiency .",
    "however , as more energy is deposited in the accretion flow rather than radiated away , the riaf becomes hot enough to primarily radiate in the x - ray band as inverse compton emission ( e.g. , yuan & narayan 2004 ) . hence the agn becomes x - ray dominant in this later stage .",
    "furthermore , the decrease in the uv / optical radiation , as well as possible consumption of broad - line - region and narrow - line - region clumps , leads to a substantial drop in emission line flux .",
    "this later accretion phase can last much longer than the initial uv / optical phase because the low accretion rate can be easily maintained by small amounts of infalling gas and/or relic circumnuclear medium .",
    "this simple picture postulates that agn are optically dominant early on and gradually fade and change into x - ray dominant agn . in this scenario ,",
    "optical and x - ray agn are generically the same population of objects , observed at different evolutionary stages .",
    "the environmental dependence of agn properties is then a natural consequence of accretion evolution : agn are preferentially discovered as x - ray agn in evolved systems like clusters of galaxies , where the merger events occurred a long time ago and rapid accretion onto the smbh has ceased ; while they are preferentially discovered as optical agn in dynamically young systems like groups where the merger events have more recently occurred .",
    "some additional inferences are :    1 .",
    "since agn spend a longer time in the low accretion rate , x - ray bright phase than in the high accretion rate , optical bright phase , the number density of x - ray agn is larger than that of optical agn ( mushotzky 2004 and reference therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the number density of x - ray selected agn should peak at later cosmic time than optically - selected agn ( barger et al .",
    "2002 ; fabian 2004 ; hasinger , miyaji & schmidt 2005 ) .",
    "2 .   on average x - ray agn should have lower bolometric luminosities than optical agn , which is consistent with the fact that _ chandra _ agn sources have considerably less mean bolometric luminosity than optically - selected agn ( e.g. , mushotzky 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , an anti - correlation between the intrinsic x - ray / optical luminosity ratio ( or spectral hardness ) and optical / uv luminosity is expected because during the early stages agn are more dominant in the optical / uv band and more luminous .",
    "this intrinsic anti - correlation is indeed observed in a recent study of the soft x - ray properties of an optically - selected agn sample ( strateva et al . 2005 ) .",
    "many authors have suggested that the x - ray emission from optically - selected agn is too soft to account for the hard x - ray background ( e.g. , natarajan 2004 and reference therein ) .",
    "this is a natural result in our model : most optically - selected agn are in the optical - dominant phase and thus have relatively soft x - ray spectra .",
    "however , sources with radiatively inefficient accretion flows are able to produce x - ray emission with a spectral shape similar to the hard x - ray background ( di matteo & fabian 1997 ; yi & boughn 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the hard x - ray sources that dominate the hard x - ray background are likely aged agn which were luminous optical agn in the past .",
    "a more subtle implication is for the different clustering properties of x - ray and optically - selected agn .",
    "optical agn have a similar clustering strength to that of galaxies at @xmath47 , with a comoving correlation length @xmath48 mpc ( e.g. , zehavi et al . 2005 ; croom et al .",
    "the correlation length is larger for x - ray selected agn ( e.g. , basilakos et al .",
    "2004 ; yang et al . 2006 ; puccetti et al . 2006 ) , and even larger for hard x - ray selected agn ( @xmath49 mpc , puccetti et al . 2006 ) .",
    "naively , one might expect that given a monotonic relationship between luminosity and mass , x - ray agn should reside in less massive dark matter halos since they tend to be less luminous .",
    "therefore , x - ray agn are expected to cluster less strongly than optical agn - the opposite sense of what is observed ( e.g. , mushotzky 2004 ) .",
    "this puzzle is clarified in the scenario proposed above .",
    "though x - ray agn are less luminous , they do _ not _ reside in less massive dark matter halos .",
    "it is the time evolution of individual agn that blurs the connection between bolometric luminosity and host dark matter halo mass .",
    "x - ray agn were once luminous optical agn at higher redshift . using a high redshift ( @xmath50 ) sample from sdss , shen et al .",
    "( 2006 , submitted ) have done a clustering analysis for high redshift optical quasars and find that they are more strongly clustered than low redshift quasars , with a comoving correlation length comparable to that of the hard x - ray agn .",
    "these once luminous optical agn gradually fade and become less luminous x - ray agn at lower redshift , while their spatial clustering properties remain .",
    "we have studied the optical and x - ray properties of agn in eight low redshift groups of galaxies .",
    "we spectroscopically identify @xmath51 of the group members ( down to @xmath25 ) to be agn .",
    "none of these optical agn are detected in x - rays .",
    "we detect only one additional agn in x - rays .",
    "this object , which shows no optical agn signatures , is a member of the most dynamically evolved group .",
    "hence unlike rich clusters of galaxies , poor galaxy groups appear to lack a significant population of x - ray bright , optically - dull agn .",
    "these observations support a simple scenario where agn gradually evolve from optically to x - ray dominant as the accretion rate drops .",
    "although this simple model can qualitatively explain many observations of x - ray and optical agn , a more quantitative understanding of the properties of x - ray and optical agn ( i.e. , luminosity functions , clustering properties ) will require the convolution of this time evolution for individual agn and many other factors ( e.g. , merger rate , halo mass function , agn lifetimes , etc . ) , combined with a better understanding of smbh accretion physics .",
    "in addition , our current group sample is still very small .",
    "more detailed studies of both optically and x - ray selected agn in a range of environments will help provide further constraints on the ideas presented here .",
