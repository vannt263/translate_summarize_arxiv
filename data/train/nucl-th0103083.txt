    "the rate of @xmath0 production in @xmath1@xmath1 , @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath2@xmath3 collisions involving oxygen and sulphur projectiles is well understood in terms of a hard production of the @xmath4 pair followed by nuclear absorption @xcite . in pb ",
    "pb collisions , however , evidence for an additional suppression mechanism , the so - called anomalous suppression , has been obtained by the na50 collaboration @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the recent na50 data @xcite a second drop in the pattern of the @xmath0 production occurs at high transverse energy ( @xmath5 ) , that is , for the most central collisions .",
    "the origin of this second drop is the focus of this contribution .",
    "it is possible to explain the anomalous @xmath0 suppression by using a scenario @xcite which relates it to the local energy density @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , we formulate a simple geometrical model in which final state interactions suppress all the @xmath0 s originating from @xmath7 pairs produced in a region where the local energy density @xmath6 exceeds some critical threshold @xmath8 .",
    "we then assume that the local energy density is proportional to the density @xmath9 of participant nucleons per unit area ( transverse to the collision axis ) calculated in a glauber model @xcite : the total transverse energy is then proportional to the number of participants , as observed experimentally .",
    "in such a model , the suppression criterion depends only on the impact parameter ( through @xmath9 ) , so that the @xmath0 suppression saturates at high @xmath5 where the impact parameter is essentially zero ( see the short - dashed curve in fig.[f : plot]b ) .",
    "a clear deviation from this simple behavior is seen in the most recent na50 data .",
    "a better description is obtained by taking into account the fluctuations of @xmath5 for a given impact parameter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are an essential component of the tail of the @xmath5 distribution ( see fig.[f : plot]a ) . as a simple ansatz",
    ", we take the distribution of @xmath5 at fixed @xmath10 to be a gaussian with mean value @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of participants at impact parameter @xmath13 and @xmath14 the corresponding density per unit area at the transverse coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "the dispersion of the gaussian is given by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the values of the fit parameters @xmath18  gev and @xmath19 are those determined by the na50 collaboration @xcite .",
    "b8.7 cm    part of the @xmath5 fluctuations is physical , part is due to the intrinsic resolution of the na50 electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the physical @xmath5 fluctuations @xmath23 @xcite thus differ only by 10% from the observed fluctuations @xmath24 for central collisions ( @xmath25  gev ) , so that we neglect the intrinsic resolution in what follows .    in order to take into account the @xmath5 fluctuations , we replace the previous estimate @xmath26 @xcite , with the more accurate @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus for a given impact parameter , the energy density is proportional to @xmath5 @xcite . with this prescription ,",
    "the average energy density in the collision area @xmath28 , defined by @xmath29 , is proportional to @xmath30 , in agreement with the traditional bjorken estimate @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand that this improvement leads to an increased suppression at high @xmath5 . indeed , at high @xmath5 where the geometry of the collision is essentially fixed at zero impact parameter , the local energy density @xmath6 scales like @xmath5 and the region where it exceeds @xmath8 becomes bigger and bigger as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this model reproduces the main features of the @xmath0 production pattern observed by na50 ; however , it does not provide a perfect fit to the data @xcite .",
    "a better description is obtained if we allow for two thresholds , in line with the idea of successive meltings of the @xmath31 and the @xmath0 ( full curve in fig.[f : plot]b ) .",
    "however we should emphasize that an identically good fit is obtained for a gradual suppression above a single threshold .",
    "therefore the structure in the pattern of @xmath0 suppression can not be interpreted as a signal of the successive meltings of charmonium resonances . in any case",
    ", we stress that the convolution of the suppression factor with the impact parameter distribution ( for a given @xmath5 ) and the energy density profile in the interaction region tends to smoothen any threshold , even that associated with the onset of the anomalous suppression at lower @xmath5 .",
    "whatever the chosen scenario and/or the value of the thresholds , we always obtain a second drop starting around the knee of the @xmath5distribution , which directly reflects the effect of @xmath5 fluctuations . note that in order to account for the data , all the @xmath0 s must be suppressed at the highest energy densities .    we have estimated the average transverse momentum squared of the produced @xmath0 s as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "analogous computations have been done in @xcite and we reproduce the behavior predicted there : at low @xmath5 , @xmath32 increases rapidly due to initial state scattering of the @xmath4 pair @xcite ; this increase saturates when anomalous suppression sets in , and @xmath32 eventually decreases above the knee of the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "compared to the calculation in @xcite , this decrease is amplified by @xmath5 fluctuations .",
    "this behavior is not compatible with the centrality dependence of @xmath32 recently measured by na50 @xcite .",
    "indeed the data show a monotonous increase with @xmath5 .",
    "note however that our suppression criterion is @xmath33-independent , while various arguments lead us to expect that a @xmath0 with a high @xmath33 is to be less suppressed .",
    "the implementation of such effects is under way @xcite .",
    "the recent phobos measurement @xcite shows that the total multiplicity is larger by 70% at rhic than at sps in central collisions .",
    "we thus assume that the energy density is also increased by 70% at rhic .",
    "the above model then yields a parameter free prediction for au - au collisions at rhic , which is plotted as the long - dashed curve in fig.[f : plot]b . in order to compare rhic and sps results",
    ", we have rescaled the rhic tranverse energy so that the knees of the two distributions coincide . in the glauber model formulas",
    ", we use the value of the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section @xmath34 mb at rhic energies , instead of @xmath35 mb at sps energies .",
    "we have assumed so far that the energy density scales with the density of participants , i.e. @xmath36 ; this was a consequence of the observation that multiplicities and transverse energies approximately scale with the number of participants at sps .",
    "but at rhic energies , a so - called `` hard '' component appears which gives rise to an additional term , proportional to number of binary collisions @xcite .",
    "the density per unit transverse area of binary collisions is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the nucleus profile function , and this term must be taken into account in evaluating the energy density .",
    "we have checked numerically that this does not change qualitatively our predictions for @xmath0 suppression .    since the energy density is significantly larger at rhic than at sps , the anomalous suppression sets in earlier . around the knee , the suppression for au ",
    "au collisions is about 2.5 times greater than at sps for pb  pb collisions , so that the effect of @xmath5 fluctuations , although still visible , is much reduced . in a smaller system , e.g. ca  ca , the @xmath0 suppression would be roughly the same at rhic as the pb  pb system at sps .",
    "note , however , that the present model ignores the possibility that several @xmath4 pairs may be produced in the collision . as recently shown @xcite ,",
    "this may lead to an enhancement of @xmath0 production at rhic , and may mask the suppression mechanism discussed here .",
