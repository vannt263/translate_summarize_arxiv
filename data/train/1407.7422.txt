    "given an open bounded connected lipschitz set @xmath1 and an exponent @xmath2 , we consider @xmath3 and @xmath4 the first nontrivial eigenvalues of the @xmath0laplace operator with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "we remind that these can be variationally characterized by @xmath5 and @xmath6 since exact values of such quantities are known only for specific values of @xmath7 and special domains @xmath8 , it is important to give ( sharp ) estimates for these quantities in terms of ( simple ) geometric quantities such as measure , perimeter , diameter , relative isoperimetric constants and so on . in this direction , the reader could consult for instance @xcite and the references therein .    with this respect",
    "the most celebrated example is the _ faber  krahn inequality _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) for example ) which asserts that the following minimization problem @xmath9 is ( uniquely ) solved by @xmath10dimensional balls of measure @xmath11 . by taking advantage of the homegeneity properties of the functional @xmath12 ,",
    "the previous can be summarized as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is now any @xmath10dimensional ball .",
    "then @xmath3 can be bounded from below in a sharp way just in terms the measure of the set @xmath8 .",
    "we point out that by using _ isoperimetric inequality _ or _ isodiametric inequality _ , from we can infer similar lower bounds for @xmath15 in terms of the perimeter or the diameter of @xmath8 .",
    "observe that problem becomes trivial , when we replace @xmath3 with @xmath4 . indeed , the latter is actually zero each time @xmath8 is disconnected .",
    "it turns out that the natural counterpart for @xmath16 is rather the maximization problem , i.e. @xmath17 again , this is generally expected to be solved by @xmath10dimensional balls of volume @xmath11 . unfortunately so far this problem has resisted all the attempts to be attacked with the unique exception of the case @xmath18 ( and partially of the limiting cases @xmath19 and @xmath20 , see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "the _ szeg ",
    "weinberger inequality _",
    "@xcite states in fact that for @xmath18 problem is ( uniquely ) solved by @xmath10dimensional balls of measure @xmath11 . as before ,",
    "the result can be rewritten in scaling invariant form as @xmath21 with equality holding if and only if @xmath8 is an @xmath10dimensional ball .",
    "we recall that the proof of for @xmath18 crucially exploits some pecularities of the laplacian , like linearity and the knowledge of the explicit form of eigenfunctions on balls .",
    ".2 cm a couple of comments on the szeg - weinberger result are in order .",
    "first of all , inequality says that @xmath22 can be estimated _ from above _ just in terms of the measure of @xmath8 .",
    "but differently from the case @xmath15 , now _ we can not directly infer _ similar upper bounds for @xmath22 in terms of perimeter or diameter .",
    "then one may wonder whether such a kind of estimates hold true or not for every @xmath2 , at least for some particular classes of sets .",
    "secondly , we notice that if @xmath14 is any @xmath10dimensional ball , using the fact that @xmath23 ( see @xcite or proposition [ prop : nodal ] below ) , from we can infer @xmath24 which can be see as a weak version of the szeg - weinberger inequality .",
    "again , a natural question is whether inequality can be extended to the case of @xmath25 or not .",
    "the last two questions are the starting point of our analysis . in this paper",
    "we prove indeed sharp upper bounds on @xmath4 in terms of diameter , as well as generalizations of for @xmath26 , under the additional constraint that @xmath8 is a convex set .",
    "then our main scope is to investigate the following shape optimization problem with convexity and diameter constraints @xmath27 of course , by homogeneity of the quantities involved the value @xmath28 has no bearing and could be replaced by any constant @xmath29 . in theorem [ p_cop ] we show that the previous upper bound is finite , then we compute it and show at the same time that _ this problem does not admit a solution_. notably , we show that for every admissible set @xmath8 there holds @xmath30 and we find a sequence @xmath31 of convex sets degenerating to a segment such that @xmath32 we refer to section [ sec:3 ] for more details .",
    "as we will show , the previous result can be summarized by the following scaling invariant sharp inequality @xmath33 where @xmath14 is any @xmath10dimensional ball and inequality sign is strict .",
    "the proof of is based on a clever choice of a special test function which reminds ideas exploited in @xcite . by joining and the _ isodiametric inequality _ , we immediately get ( see corollary [ coro : weaksw ] below ) @xmath34 which generalizes to @xmath25 for convex sets , as announced above . by keeping in mind the way such an estimate was proved for @xmath18 , the previous can be seen as _ the trace of a potentially existing szeg - weinberger inequality for the @xmath0laplacian_.    for ease of completeness and in order to neatly motivate some of the studies performed in this paper , it is useful to recall at this point that the _ minimization _ problem @xmath35 highlights the same features as problem .",
    "for example , here as well the infimum can be computed and is not attained .",
    "more interestingly , a minimizing sequence is again given by a family of convex sets collapsing on a segment .",
    "for @xmath18 this is a celebrated result by payne and weinberger ( see @xcite ) , recently generalized in @xcite and @xcite to @xmath25 .",
    "the result can be summarized by the sharp inequality @xmath36 where the constant @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38      it is quite natural to wonder if similar conclusions can be drawn also in the case of the following generalized notion of first eigenvalues @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "quite interestingly , it turns out that for @xmath42 one has the following picture :    * one can prove the analogue of ; .2 cm * this estimate _ is not _",
    "sharp ; .2 cm * the maximization problem @xmath43 now _ admits a solution _ ; .2 cm * a lower bound like is not possible ( and the infimum in is @xmath44 ) ;    on the contrary , for @xmath45 all the previous statements have to be reverted .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath46 and it is rather the minimization problem for @xmath47 which is now well - posed ( see section [ sec:4 ] for more details ) .",
    "in section [ sec:2 ] we prove some basic results concerning properties of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the investigation of problem . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we consider the case @xmath50 . as a consequence of some the estimates proved in the paper , in section [ sec:5 ] we exhibit a nodal domain property for neumann eigenfunctions . roughly speaking",
    ", this shows that for @xmath51 eigenfunctions associated to @xmath48 can not have a closed nodal line .",
    "finally , appendix [ sec:1d ] deals with a one - dimensional variational problem and its extremals , whose properties are crucially exploited to prove optimality of the estimate .",
    "the first author has been partially supported by the gaspard monge program for optimization ( pgmo ) , by edf and the jacques hadamard mathematical foundation , through the research contract macro .",
    "part of this work has been done during some visits of the first author to napoli .",
    "the departement of mathematics of the university of napoli and its facilities are kindly acknowledged .",
    "we fix two exponents @xmath7 and @xmath52 such that @xmath2 and @xmath53 for every @xmath1 open bounded lipschitz set , we use the standard sobolev spaces @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the latter being the completion of @xmath56 with respect to the norm of @xmath57 .",
    "we then define the two quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 it is useful to recall that @xmath48 can be defined through the unconstrained minimization @xmath60 where we set @xmath61 . also , we have that if @xmath62 is such that the equation @xmath63 admits a nontrivial solution in @xmath55 , then @xmath64 .",

    "we then define @xmath70 as the minimizer of @xmath71 thus we get @xmath72 which in turn gives the desired inequality , by minimality of @xmath73",

    "the following is the main result of the paper .",
    "this shows that the nonlinear spectral optimization problem @xmath83 does not admit a solution , but a maximizing sequence is given by a family of convex sets suitably degenerating to a segment .",
    "of course , the value @xmath28 for the diameter constraint plays no special role and could be replaced by any constant @xmath29 .",
