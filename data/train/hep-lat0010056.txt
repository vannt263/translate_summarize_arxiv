    "in the lattice calculation of the @xmath6 meson @xmath6-parameters @xcite , the use of the effective theory for heavy quark is essential to obtain results with controlled systematic errors .",
    "the static approximation in which the heavy quark mass is sent to infinity has been used by many authors @xcite , and the next step is to incorporate the correction from finite @xmath7 quark mass . in this direction , we performed an exploratory lattice calculation using the nrqcd action for heavy quark , in which we found that the @xmath8 correction could be sizable for @xmath1 @xcite and for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a drawback in these calculations was , however , that the perturbative renormalization of the four - quark operators were not available for the nrqcd action and we used the one - loop coefficients for the static action . as a result our results contained large systematic error of @xmath5 , which is about 10% if evaluated with an order counting at @xmath9 = 5.9 .    in this paper , we present a perturbative calculations of renormalization constants of the heavy - light four quark operators with the @xmath3 lattice nrqcd action .",
