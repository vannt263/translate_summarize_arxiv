    "the @xmath0li isotope is an element of considerable interest , but extremely difficult to observe , as a weak component of a blend involving the much stronger doublet of @xmath1li , and with an isotopic separation of only 0.16  .",
    "so far , it has been unambiguously detected in only two stars , hd 84937 ( smith et al .",

    "it has been unsuccessfully searched in five other halo stars by hobbs & thorburn ( @xcite ) and in 8 more by smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we have decided to reobserve hd84937 ( for which the 1 @xmath3 error bar on the abundance is one - half of the abundance found ; the best case ! ) with a signal / noise higher than obtained so far , and two other metal - poor stars in which we hoped to have a new detection of @xmath0li .",
    "let us recall the double interest of obtaining evidence for @xmath0li , in halo stars .",
    "@xmath0li is a rare and fragile isotope of spallative origin , as are @xmath4be , @xmath5b and @xmath6b .",
    "it is destroyed in stellar interiors at a temperature of about 2@xmath7 k , lower than the temperature of 2.5@xmath7 k at which @xmath1li is also destroyed .",
    "the first interest of finding @xmath0li in a halo star lying on the @xmath1li spite plateau , is the strong presumption that , if @xmath0li has survived , it is unlikely that the less fragile element @xmath1li has been significantly depleted in the star .",
    "the @xmath1li abundance on the spite plateau can then be taken as representing the cosmological abundance of @xmath1li , predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( schramm & turner 1998 ) .",
    "+ the second interest is to compare the @xmath0li abundance observed , with the predictions of recent theoretical models of spallation ( duncan et al .",
    "@xcite , vangioni - flam et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these models have been triggered by the discovery that the other spallative nuclei be and b have an abundance increasing linearily with metallicity in metal - poor stars ( boesgaard and king @xcite , boesgaard @xcite , duncan et al .",

    "recently lemoine et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have dicussed extensively the abundance found earlier for @xmath0li in the light of these recent predictions .",
    "let us recall that the dominant processus of formation for @xmath0li is the @xmath9 reaction , now believed to occur between @xmath10 particles accelerated in sne ii ejecta colliding with @xmath11 particles of the surrounding interstellar matter ( ism ) .",
    "this sets the initial abundance of @xmath0li in the star formed from this ism , and part of this @xmath0li may be subsequently burnt in the star , where we observe the remaining fraction .",
    "the initial @xmath0li can be inferred from the predicted @xmath0li /be ratio , and the observed be abundance ( see also molaro et al .",
    "the depletion of @xmath0li within the star , by the @xmath0li(p,@xmath12he)@xmath8he process , is obtained by comparing the observed abundance of @xmath0li in the star to the estimated initial abundance .",
    "models of lithium burning by mixing of the convective zone with deeper layers allow to translate the estimated depletion level of @xmath0li into some maximum depletion level for @xmath1li in the same star ( cayrel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . + for this approach it is of course vital to be sure that @xmath0li is present .",
    "it is why we have decided to observe hd 84937 with a higher s / n ratio , and to observe two other halo stars , not yet analysed for @xmath0li , bd + 42 2667 and bd + 36 2165",
    ". actually bd + 42 2667 was also analysed in parallel by smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but we were not aware of the work at the time of our observations .",

    "section 5 gives the results for the two other stars .",
    "section 6 discusses the significance of our results , and section 7 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "spectra of the three selected stars hd 84937 , bd+42 2667 and bd+36 2165 were obtained with the spectrograph gecko at the 3.6 m cfht telescope in hawaii ( the log - book of the observations is given in table 1 ) .",
    "the resolving power of the spectrograph , measured on thorium lines , is @xmath13 .",
    "the spectra were centered at 6710  , the region of the lii resonance doublet . in order to check the width of the lines , a spectrum of hd 84937",
    "was also obtained in the region of the stronger , well defined , calcium line at @xmath14  .",
    "the detector was a 2048x2048 15@xmath15 m pixels ccd fabricated by loral .",
    "the nominal gain of this ccd is 2.3 e adu@xmath16 , the read out noise 5.3 e pixel@xmath16 , totally negligible on our well exposed spectra .",
    "the pixel width was @xmath17 m , corresponding to .02698  .",
    "all the spectra have been reduced with a semi - automatic code specially developed at observatoire de paris - meudon ( spite @xcite ) .",
    "it performs the optimal extraction of the spectrum , the flat fielding and the wavelength calibration from the comparison lamp spectrum .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed with a argon - thorium lamp .",
    "the laboratory wevelengths were taken in palmer & engelman ( @xcite ) for thorium , and in kaufmann  &  edlen ( @xcite ) for argon .",
    "the rms of a third order polynomial fit , corrected for the actual number of freedhom , is of the order of 0.003 . it must be noted that , as it is well known ( and e. g. it is alluded to by hobbs & thorburn @xcite ) , the collimation angle between the beam of the lamp and the stellar beam , makes that there is a possible zero point shift between the wave length scale of the stellar and lamp spectra , and this shift may change during the night .",
    "moreover , as the exposure time for the thorium lamp is about one hour , the calibration spectra were usually taken at the beginning and at the end of the night .",
    "the thorium spectra are quite usable for establishing a calibration curve , but their zero - point can be slightly shifted at the time of the stellar exposure .",
    "this is why we have determined the zero - point of the wavelength scale mostly from the position of the calcium @xmath18   line , taken in the same exposure as the lithium feature .",
    "although the calcium @xmath19  line ( wavelength from sugar & corliss @xcite ) is better defined , it was not used for wawelength zero - point determination , for the reason explained above .",
    "flat - fielding has been done using a quartz lamp and a rapidly rotating hot star . due to small fringes produced by the ccd in the spectral range of the lithium line",
    ", the hot star has been finally preferred for flat fielding .    the stellar broadening ( @xmath20.15   is clearly larger than the spectrograph resolution ( @xmath20 .07  ) , and thus the stellar profiles are dominated by intrinsic stellar broadening .",

    "having used the same atomic data for the lithium feature , we have considered as adjustable parameters , in the fitting of a synthetic spectrum to an observed spectrum , the five parameters ( i ) placement of the continuum , ( ii ) and ( iii ) abundances of the two elements @xmath0li and @xmath1li , ( iv ) macroscopic broadening of the lines ( encompassing instrumental profile , star rotation and macroscopic motions in the atmosphere of the object ) , and ( v ) wavelength zero - point adjustment .",
    "the profile of the macroscopic broadening was assumed to be gaussian and is defined by its full width at half maximum fwhm .",
    "the permissible range of this last parameter was determined by the observation of the two calcium lines at 6162 and 6717  .",
    "each time , the quality of the fit between 27 points of the synthetic versus observed data points was computed and shown graphically .",

    ", one must know the value of the observational standard error on each of the data point .",
    "when several spectra were available we have co - added them . as we had a spectral resolution higher than needed to separate the isotopic shift of 0.16   between the @xmath0li and @xmath1li lines , we have also convolved the coadded spectra by a gaussian of fwhm = 1.66 pixel @xmath22 0.045  . before this convolution the s /",
    "n on each data point was 650 for hd 84937 ( estimated in segments of the continuum , and consistent with the expected photon noise ) .",
    "after convolution it raised to 1020 ( noise filtering ) .",
    "this represents a significant improvement in s / n , without a damaging loss of resolution .",
    "one must realize however , that the classical @xmath23 test is not directly applicable to the filtered spectrum , because the filtering introduces a correlation between data point values .",
    "so we have computed ( see appendix ) the applicable pseudo-@xmath23 probability function for the quantity @xmath24 :    @xmath25    where the @xmath26 have been smothed by the convolution performed . following a widely used notation ,",
    "the @xmath27 are the computed values of the synthetic spectrum , and @xmath28 is the noise on the @xmath29 data point . as it will be explained in detail further , this approach permits a more powerful discrimination of the weak signal produced by the @xmath0li feature , thanks to the improvement in the s / n ratio .",
    "because of its particular interest we discuss in the following section , in more detail , the case of hd 84937 .",
    "it is often considered ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) that there are chiefly two methods for determining the isotopic ratio @xmath0li / @xmath1li . the presence of @xmath0li modifies the blend in ( i ) modifying the center of gravity in wavelength of the feature and ( ii ) modifying the line profile by increasing the opacity on the red wing .",
    "the first one is refered as the `` c.o.g '' method , and the second as `` line profile analysis '' .",
    "however both effects are combined in the spectrum synthesis approach .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have pointed out that the `` c.o.g . ''",
    "method is vulnerable to a possible differential convective blue shift between the formation of the li blend and the only available other line in the spectral field , the ca i 6717.687 ( pierce and breckinridge @xcite ) .",
    "actually , the blue shifts of solar lines have a fairly large range of values ( from -.7 km / s to zero , see allende prieto & garca lpez @xcite ) .",
    "kurucz ( @xcite ) has claimed that the effect of convective temperature inhomogeneities could be considerably larger in metal - poor stars than in solar type stars .",
    "bonifacio&molaro ( @xcite ) have given a strong counter - argument concerning the claim of a large effect on the abundance of li , but the question of a wavelength shift remains .",
    "furthermore , smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( this work came to our knowledge after we wrote the submitted version of this paper ) cite an unpublished work by rosberg and johansson giving a @xmath30 of 6717.677 for the line instead of 6717.687 we first used .",
    "they also mention that if the c.o.g method give a slight shift in the right direction for hd 84937 it gives a blue shift , in contradiction with the result of the line profile analysis , for the other star , bd + 26 3578 .",
    "quantitatively speaking , the c.o.g .",
    "method is clearly far inferior to the line profile analysis , a differential blue shift of only .001    corresponding to a relative change of 20 per cent in the @xmath0li/ @xmath1li ratio ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas such a shift has no influence on the line profile analysis , as being negligible with respect to the isotopic shift of 0.16  .",
    "martin asplund ( private communication ) has investigated from hydrodynamical simulations of convection , the size of differential blue shifts between the lithium feature and ca i , 6162 and 6717 .",
    "his preliminary results are that the ca i lines are blue - shifted with respect to the lithium feature in hd 84937 , by 0.2 to 0.4 km / s .",
    "this is enough to completely kill the c.o.g .",
    "method , the corresponding variation in wavelength being 9 m , larger than the shift between 5 per cent of @xmath0li and no @xmath0li at all .",
    "therefore , the safest approach , adopted here , is to consider that all relevant parameters are allowed to vary , including the zero - point of the wavelength scale , and then comparing this least - square solution to the values of the parameter which can be externally determined from other lines , _ but allowing for the error bars on these external determinations_. this is what smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and hobbs and thorburn ( @xcite ) have also done , concluding that the constraints on the @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratio was significantly relaxed by this approach , a price to pay for not being dependent on assumptions on convective shifts , or ignoring that the macro - broadening of the lines can not be fixed exactly .",
    "the situation is illustrated by the figures 1 to 4 .",
    "first we consider as free parameters the position of the continuum , the abundance of the two isotopes of lithium , the macroscopic broadening ( due to stellar rotation , macroscopic motions in the stellar atmosphere , and finite resolution of the spectrograph ) and the poorly determined zero - point of the wavelength scale .",
    "the best fit to the data point , allowing the 5 parameters to vary , is shown by the full line of fig .",
    "this best fit is obtained for the following values : @xmath0li / @xmath1li = 5.2% , log(@xmath1li / h)=2.088 , fwhm= 0.148  , and an adjustment of the ordinate scale of 0.06 per cent and of the zero point in wavelength by 10 m .",
    "the residuals of this fit are shown in fig .",
    "the rms of the fit on 27 points with the unfiltered data is 0.00120 .",
    "the expected value of the @xmath21 for 27 points and 5 adjusted parameters is 22 for a perfect model , and the value found for the fit is 16.4 . with the filtered data the corresponding numbers are rms = 0.00073 , 22 and 15",
    "this means that the model represents the data without the need of increasing the number of the parameters , and that the realization of the noise corresponding to our observation is slightly better than its mathematical expectation , but reasonably close to it .",
    "now we can compare the value of the zero - point wavelength shift and the value found for fwhm with the accuracy of our wawelength scale and the value of fwhm determined from the ca i lines .",
    "the expected accuracy of our wavelength scale is dominated by the uncertainty on the exact wawelength of the 6717 line , plus the unknown value of the differential blue - shift between the li lines and the 6717 ca i line .",
    "this is of the order of 0.6 km / s , or 13 m .",
    "the shift obtained for the li i feature _ with the new value 6717.677 for the laboratory value of the ca i line _ is - 10 m .",
    "this is within the uncertainties , although not in the direction predicted by asplund .",
    "however , the ca i line is strongly blended in the sun , and very weak in hd 84937 , so any conclusion based on such a small shift would be a clear overinterpretation of the data .",
    "the external values of fwhm are respectively 0.150 @xmath31 ( 6717 line ) and 0.153 @xmath32 ( 6162 line , slightly saturated ) .",
    "the best fit ( 0.148  ) is totally compatible with the external values , which , unfortunately , do not allow to restrict efficiently the internal uncertainties .",
    "now we retry the fit , forcing the abundance of @xmath0li to zero , but keeping the 4 other parameters free .",
    "we get a different solution , with log(@xmath1li / h ) = 2.233 , fwhm= 0.158 , a differential redshift with ca i 6717.677 of 0.005   and a negligible change in the continuum position .",
    "the residuals of this new fit are shown in fig .",
    "the rms of the fit is 0.00119 ( with the continuum at 1.0 ) , corresponding to a value of @xmath24 of 39.8 , rejecting this no-@xmath0li model with a confidence level of 95.3 per cent .",
    "would we have used the unfiltered spectrum , the rms of the fit would have been 0.00155 , corresponding to a @xmath23 of 27.3 for an expectation value of 27 - 4=23 , which is excluded only at the 76 per cent level",
    ". however , many authors use a reduced relative @xmath23/@xmath33 , not bothering for estimating the noise independently . in that case",
    "the unfiltered @xmath23 being 16.4 for the best fit with 5.2 per cent of @xmath0li , one can claim that the @xmath23 has been degraded in the ratio 27.3/16.4 when the expected degradation is 24/23 .",
    "the probability of such a difference is only about 3 per cent .",
    "of course the same approach can be also applied to the filtered data , leading to an exclusion of the zero @xmath0li hyphothesis at the 99.5 per cent level .",
    "we do not support these numbers , too optimistic , and we suggest to bring instead , now more attention to the run of the residuals with wavelength .",
    "the shape of the residuals with wavelength is very suggestive of being not due to a random noise . in order to check",
    "if this is the case we have compared two synthetic spectra ( _ no noise here _ ) , one corresponding to the absolute best fit , the other one corresponding to the best fit , with no @xmath0li , involving a 0.005    shift in wavelength .",
    "the residuals of the second versus the first one are shown in fig .",
    "the similarity between fig",
    ". 5 and 6 is striking . fig .",
    "6 also shows how important it is to reach a s / n of 1000 , to discriminate between these two cases .",
    "we consider that the rejection of a zero - abundance of @xmath0li at the 95 per cent level , _ in the most permissive case _",
    ", represents a serious advance with respect to former works , done with a lesser s / n ratio .    a bayesian approach of the problem , that we have not attempted , is likely to increase our value of @xmath0li , because of the _ a priori _ positive physical nature of the abundance of @xmath0li .",
    "for shifts larger than 0.005   the solution would need @xmath0li in emission , not acceptable .",
    "the 68 per cent probability around the optimal fit ( @xmath0li /@xmath1li = 0.052 ) can be computed when the continuum level , and the two abundances are free parameters , because they occur linearily .",
    "we find that this amounts to @xmath34 .012 .",
    "an extra - allowance must be made for the impact of the uncertainties on the other two parameters .",
    "for the fwhm of the broadening , if we accept the full range of fig .",
    "2 , with equal probability of the fwhm in the range , we obtain an extra contribution of @xmath34 .007 .",
    "the contribution of a zero - point shift in wavelength is more difficult to estimate .",
    "a shift as large as the one needed for the no @xmath0li hyphothesis is largely rejected .",
    "we consider that a shift of @xmath34 .002 is allowed .",

    "the combined effect is 0.019 , adding quadratically",

    "what makes hd 84937 so special ?",
    "we present in figure 8 , the hr diagram of metal poor stars with distances reliably established by hipparcos .",
    "clearly , from hipparcos parallaxes , hd 84937 is among the stars deficient by more than a factor of 100 in metals , also among the evolved subgiants , with bd+26 3578 , and hd 140283 .",
    "it means that it is also one of higher mass , less prone to @xmath0li burning .",
    "hd 140283 is in principle even more favourable from this point of view , but its extremely low metallicity makes it less good for having inherited enough @xmath0li by spallation , and also the star is possibly evolved enough to have diluted its @xmath0li in a thick convective zone ( chaboyer @xcite ) .",
    "actually the case the more similar to hd84937 is bd + 26 3578 , for which @xmath0li detection has been claimed by smith ( @xcite ) and smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we have theoretically investigated @xmath0li destruction along the zams in metal - poor stars .",
    "the details are described in another paper ( cayrel et al .",
    "the principle on which it is based is that the burning rate has such a fast variation with temperature that @xmath0li , as well as @xmath1li , at a given depth below the convective zone , either do not burn in 15 gyr , or burn so fast that they are destroyed in less than 1 gyr , or so .",
    "the rate of decline of the abundance of the element in the convective zone is then controlled by exchange of matter between the convective zone and the deeper zone deprived very soon of the element . this rate is a purely hydrodynamical quantity .",
    "so if for example , we find that @xmath1li is strongly depleted in the convective zone when the burning layer is separated from the convective zone by a layer having a thickness in mass equal to half of the mass of the convective zone , we shall assume that this will hold for @xmath0li also , taking of course into account the fact that the location of the fast burning zone is moved upwards for @xmath0li .",
    "this allows us to transform the @xmath1li depletion curve into a @xmath0li depletion curve .",
    "clearly , at metallicity [ fe / h]= -1.5 , only the most massive stars ( @xmath45 can save their @xmath0li . at [ fe / h]= -1 . , @xmath0li even burns _ inside _ the convective zone , so there is no hope to find any @xmath0li .",
    "we have not yet investigated the dilution effect , above the turn off , but chaboyer ( @xcite ) finds that this process becomes effective at the position of hd 140283 .",
    "8 shows the position of the stars in which @xmath0li has been found or is possibly present with an abundance less than 10 per cent of the abundance of @xmath1li .",
    "they clearly cluster along the turn off , in agreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "these considerations make understandable that @xmath0li can be found only in a very limited portion of the hr diagram .",
    "two other stars , bd + 42 2667 and bd + 36 2165 have been observed .",
    "the profile of the lithium line of the first star is best explained by a @xmath0li / @xmath1li ratio of 10% . and the hypothesis of no @xmath0li provides a considerably worse fit .",
    "if again a shift in wavelength is allowed , the profile may be explained by a @xmath0li / @xmath1li ratio of only 5% ( fig .",
    "9 ) , so that the value of the abundance of @xmath0li may seem rather uncertain . assuming the hypothesis of no @xmath0li , a not too bad fit may be found ( fig.10 ) ,    these observations point towards a detection of @xmath0li in this star , but the modest s / n ratio reached in the observation of this star precludes a conclusion at a very high confidence level .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have also studied bd + 42 2667 and conclude that it has probably no @xmath0li .",
    "we do not fight this conclusion , the residuals being unsufficiently apart in the two cases .",
    "the other observed star , , does not provide any definite detection of @xmath0li . the s / n ratio reached is even lower , and does not enable any firm constraint .",
    "the observation of hd 84937 has essential consequences , first on the depletion of @xmath0li ( and indirectly that of of @xmath1li ) in pop ii stars , and on the cosmological status of li / h observed in old metal - poor stars , and also on @xmath0li ( and be and b ) production .",
    "the @xmath0li isotope is a pure spallation product ( see reeves @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this fragile nucleus is burnt at low temperature ( about @xmath46 k ) and can not be synthesized inside stars .",
    "spallation agents are ( i ) galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) , specifically acting in the galactic disk through p , @xmath47 + he , cno @xmath48 @xmath0li,@xmath1li and ( ii ) in the halo phase ( [ fe / h ] @xmath49 ) , low energy @xmath10,c and o nuclei ejected and accelerated by supernovae , interacting with h and he in the ism ( cass et al .",
    "@xcite , ramaty et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this low energy component ( lec ) is likely to be responsible for the linear relationship between be , b and [ fe / h ] discovered recently ( duncan et al .",
    "@xcite , molaro et al .",
    "@xcite , thorburn & hobbs @xcite , primas @xcite garca lpez et al .",
    "@xcite ) as shown by vangioni - flam et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this linear relationship , specifically in the early galaxy , is due to the fact that freshly synthesized @xmath10 , c and o from sne are accelerated at moderate energy and fragment on the h , he nuclei in the ism .",
    "thus , the production rate is independent of the ism metallicity ( which means that be and b are `` primary '' ) . the @xmath0li isotope itself is also produced by primary processes , through the two spallative processes gcr and lec .",
    "consequently , its slope in the ( @xmath50(@xmath0li /h ) , [ fe / h ] ) plane is unity .",
    "the @xmath0li abundance observed in the atmosphere of hd 84937 is a lower limit to that of the interstellar medium out of which this star has formed since this isotope can be depleted in stellar atmosphere due to proton capture and dilution with li free material coming from the interior .",
    "the depletion factor is still uncertain in spite of many efforts to evaluate it ( lemoine et al .",
    "@xcite , chaboyer @xcite , vauclair & charbonnel @xcite , deliyannis & malaney @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0li is detected in the atmosphere of a pop .",
    "ii star , like hd 84937 , one can infer reasonnably that the @xmath1li abundance is essentially unaffected , since @xmath1li is destroyed at a higher stellar temperature than @xmath0li , and in this case the li / h ratio is close to the primordial one .    in this context , it is important to analyze @xmath0li data versus @xmath1li and to follow the early rise of the @xmath0li / h ratio due to the @xmath47 , c , o + h , he processes described above , as a function of [ fe / h ] ( evolutionary curve ) , since this theoretical @xmath0li / h value represents at any time ( metallicity ) the initial abundance in the forming stars .",
    "since @xmath0li can only be depleted in stars , the observed points are located on this curve ( no depletion ) or below .",
    "previous calculations ( vangioni - flam et al .",
    "@xcite ) give the li / h versus [ fe / h ] evolution ( see their figure 1 ) where the spallative lithium is shown for lec and grc .",
    "this last component is weaker than the first .",
    "associated to the calculated @xmath0li / @xmath1li ( their table 1 ) the lec curve allows to predict the evolution of @xmath0li / h ; at [ fe / h ] = -2.3 corresponding to the metallicity of hd 84937 , the theoretical @xmath0li / h is slightly below the observation .",
    "this characterizes only a specific model .",
    "it is possible to find other scenarios able to reproduce all the libeb observational constraints , using metal - poor sn ii compositions , well suited to the early galaxy ( woosley & weaver @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of models meets the requirement of a high he / o source ratio , as pointed out by smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , to explain the high @xmath0li /@xmath4be ratio .",
    "this indicates that if @xmath0li is destroyed and/or diluted , it is only slightly .",
    "this is a challenge for the stellar evolution theory .",
    "it is satisfying to see that in this case , the theoretical description of the @xmath0li evolution in the early galaxy is globally consistent with our observations .",
    "the occurrence of lec is strenghthened by this observation .",
    "this theoretical model has some latitude depending on the composition and energy spectrum of the beam adopted , as said above .",
    "it is possible to find other source composition able to reproduce the libeb observational constraints , including the uncomfortably high @xmath0li / be ratio found here in hd 84937 by us , and other authors .",
    "a further discussion is postponed to a forthcoming paper ( vangioni - flam et al .",
    "@xcite ) . + a word of caution ,",
    "however . our analysis is based on the abundance of @xmath0li in one star , or two when the ratio @xmath0li  /  @xmath1li of 5 percent in bd + 26 3578 ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) will be confirmed .",
    "more precise be abundances in the two stars would be useful , as well as a richer sample of stars with measured @xmath0li .    even assuming that the estimation of the initial @xmath0li abundance is in error by a factor of 3 , our observation shows that @xmath0li has been depleted by a factor of 3 , at the most .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1li depletion to @xmath0li depletion is model dependent .",
    "the burning of @xmath1li in the region depleting @xmath0li by a factor of possibly 3 is close to negligible .",
    "if @xmath1li is depleted , it is in deeper layers , where we are sure that the mixing is slower , but by an amount which is very model dependent . under the simple model we have considered in section 4.3 the depletion of @xmath1li can not be more than 0.1 dex if the depletion of @xmath0li is below 0.5 dex .",
    "regarding the cosmological consequences of this li abundance determination and analysis , it is interesting to note that the @xmath1li abundance @xmath1li / h = 1.6 10@xmath51 in hd 84937 :    \\(i ) is for a star which belongs to the spite plateau and    \\(ii ) is likely to represent the primordial value , once corrected for the small amount of @xmath1li produced with the @xmath0li by the lec proces , since @xmath1li has not been affected by thermonuclear destructions ( our above discussion ) . by comparing this li / h value with the outcome of standard bbn calculations ( sarkar @xcite , schramm & turner @xcite ) this would lead to @xmath52 2.0 to 3.5 , ( or @xmath53 0.02 to 0.035 for @xmath54= 60 km.s@xmath16.mpc@xmath16 ) , @xmath55 0.237 to 0.245 , d@xmath56/h @xmath57 10@xmath58 to 5@xmath5910@xmath60 .",
    "this range on d@xmath56/h is compatible with both the high and low values of d / h measured in cosmological clouds on the line of sight of quasars ( burles & tytler @xcite , webb et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "more @xmath0li , @xmath1li observations in the atmospheres of old metal - poor stars could strengthen both the argument of occurence of the lec process in the early history of the galaxy , and the use of @xmath1li as a cosmological test , since the determination of the spite plateau seems to reflect the true big bang value .",
    "the main result of this paper is an analysis , with improved accuracy , of the star hd 84937 , leading to a new measurement of of @xmath0li in hd 84937 . with a s / n of about 650 per pixel,(1020 on the filtered spectrum ) instead of 400",
    "( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 350 ( hobbs & thorburn @xcite ) reached previously , a null abundance of @xmath0li is now more convincingly ruled out .",
    "the abundance found for @xmath0li ( 5.2 per cent of the abundance of @xmath1li ) turns out to be close the expected value of the initial @xmath0li in hd 84937 , using the evolutionary models developed by vangioni - flam et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    the process of formation of the libeb elements just quoted above is now shown to be consistent also for @xmath0li , provided that the @xmath61 process is the dominant source of @xmath0li in the early galaxy",
    ".    the nearly equality between the predicted initial @xmath0li / h value and the observed value in hd 84937 shows that @xmath0li can not have been strongly depleted in this star .",
    "@xmath1li , more robust , is necessarily still less depleted , and its abundance can then be taken as representative of the cosmological primordial lithium .",
    "the convolution of the spectra by a narrow gaussian profile of standard deviation @xmath62 pixel , bringing an unsignificant degradation in spectral resolution , but increasing the signal / noise ratio by 57 per cent , make the classical @xmath63 test inapplicable , because the noise on consecutive pixels becomes correlated . in order to properly discuss the @xmath64 residuals , it is necessary to derive the expected mean value of the sum of the @xmath65 , and its expected variance , in our specific case , where the independent random variables are the noise on each data point , _ before _ convolution .",
