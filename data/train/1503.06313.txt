    "magnetars are neutron stars in which the main source of energy is provided by a strong magnetic field , instead of rotation , accretion , nuclear reactions , or cooling .",
    "while the bulk of rotation - powered ( radio ) pulsars have fields in the range b@xmath3 g , the external magnetic field of magnetars is typically @xmath4 g and it is likely that their internal field is even stronger .",
    "however , the distributions of field intensities for magnetars and `` normal '' neutron stars overlap : there is not a discriminating b threshold between these two classes .",
    "indeed , the presence of a strong dipole field ( typically estimated from the star spin period and spin - down rate ) is not a sufficient ( nor a necessary ) condition to trigger `` magnetar - like '' activity .",
    "the latter is in fact mainly related to the presence of a significant toroidal component of the internal field , able to produce magnetospheric twists .",
    "magnetars are the most variable sources among the different classes of isolated neutron stars : their characterizing property is the emission , in the x - ray and soft @xmath5-ray range , of powerful short bursts which often reach super - eddington luminosities .",
    "more rarely , they also emit intermediate and giant flares , the latter involving the release of up to about 10@xmath6 erg in less than half a second .",
    "magnetars also show pulsed x - ray emission with typical luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 in persistent sources , and ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 erg s@xmath1 in transient ones .",
    "the pulsations , caused by the neutron star rotation , have periods of a few seconds which are secularly increasing on timescales from one thousand to several million years ( @xmath10 s s@xmath1 ) .    due to this variety of phenomena ,",
    "most of the sources that are now believed to be magnetars were initially classified in different ways and only later recognized as members of the same class of astrophysical objects .",
    "bursts from magnetars had been observed since the end of the 1970s @xcite .",
    "they were initially classified as a sub - class of @xmath5-ray bursts , with the peculiarity of a softer spectrum and of coming repeatedly from the same sky directions @xcite .",
    "they were thus named soft @xmath5-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "a secure identification with astrophysical objects known at other wavelengths was unfeasible with the large positional uncertainties available at that time , but their possible association with supernova remnants suggested a neutron star nature .",
    "other sources that are now believed to be magnetars were discovered as persistent pulsars in the soft x - ray range ( @xmath1110 kev ) and thought to be x - ray binaries powered by accretion , as most of the bright x - ray sources known at that time .",
    "it was later pointed out that their narrow period distribution , long term spin - down , soft x - ray spectrum and faint optical counterparts were at variance with the properties of pulsars in massive binaries @xcite .",
    "this led to their denomination as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "we now believe that sgrs and axps are a single class of objects .",
    "in fact , when the persistent x - ray counterparts of sgrs were identified @xcite , it was found that they are pulsating sources very similar to the axps @xcite , and sgr - like bursts were detected from several sources originally classified as axps @xcite .",
    "about two dozens of axps / sgrs are currently known in our galaxy ( plus one in each of the magellanic clouds ) .",
    "most of them show x - ray pulsations and have been seen to emit bursts . for extensive reviews of the axps / sgrs observations and of the main models proposed to explain them see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we believe that the most successful explanation of the axps / sgrs is provided by the magnetar model @xcite , according to which they are neutron stars powered by a strong magnetic field .",
    "alternative intepretations based on isolated neutron stars accreting from fall - back disks formed after the supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require some additional process , besides accretion , in order to explain the powerful bursts and flares observed from these sources .",
    "in fact , the suggestion that sgrs are neutron stars powered by magnetic energy was first proposed to interpret the exceptional properties of the giant flare emitted by  on march 5 , 1979 @xcite . in the following years",
    ", the original magnetar model has been considerably developed and expanded and it provides now the best explanation for the rich diversity of axps and sgrs phenomenology ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". one essential feature of the magnetar model is the presence of significant twists in the magnetosphere @xcite , resulting in a structure quite different from that of the simple dipolar geometry assumed for normal radio pulsars and in magnetospheric currents with a charge density much larger than the classical goldreich - julian value .",
    "bursts and flares can be explained by sudden releases of energy in the star interior leading to fractures in the crust @xcite , by field reconnection events in the magnetosphere analogous to those occurring in the sun @xcite , or by pair plasma fireballs produced by discontinuities in the propagation of fast mhd waves in the magnetosphere @xcite .    in section [ properties ]",
    "we describe the properties of the so called `` persistent '' emission of magnetars . in the two following sections we review the scenarios that have been advanced for the formation of magnetars ( section [ origin ] ) and for their evolution ( section [ evolution ] ) .",
    "the main manifestations of magnetars occur in the x - ray energy range .",
    "all known confirmed magnetars show pulsations in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath1110 kev ) and many of them have also been detected in hard x - rays , up to @xmath12100 - 200 kev . about half of the known magnetars",
    "have repeatedly been observed at nearly constant x - ray luminosities of @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 , with only moderate variability ( a factor of a few ) on long timescales ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "much larger variability is seen in the transient magnetars , which reach the luminosity level of the `` constant '' magnetars only during outbursts lasting weeks / months and spend the remaining time at a much fainter , quiescent level , @xmath8 erg s@xmath1 or less ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the outbursts of transient magnetars are often associated with the emission of short bursts or flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "short bursts are also emitted by the `` constant '' magnetars , but they have never been detected from a transient magnetar in the quiescent luminosity level .",
    "the presence of regular pulsations with secularly increasing period , caused by the slowing down of the neutron star rotational velocity , is one of the distinctive properties of magnetars and provides a very useful diagnostic tool for their study .",
    "the 23 currently known magnetars have spin periods in a very narrow range ( 2 - 12 s ) , while their period derivatives span five orders of magnitude .",
    "most of them have @xmath14 in the range 10@xmath15 s s@xmath1 , but in recent years a few `` low-@xmath14 magnetars '' have been discovered , with spin - down rates as small as 4@xmath16 s s@xmath1 , well in the range of those of rotation - powered pulsars @xcite .",
    "the observed distribution of magnetars in the pulsar @xmath17 diagram gives information on their evolution and relation with other classes of neutron stars .",
    "the lack of observed magnetars with periods longer than 12 s indicates that the spin - down mechanism becomes highly inefficient at large ages and/or that old magnetars become more difficult to detect , for example because their x - ray luminosity decreases and they emit bursts less frequently . the most obvious explanation to account for these effects is magnetic field decay @xcite , as discussed in detail in section [ evolution ] .",
    "magnetars display x - ray pulse profiles with a variety of shapes ( from simple sinusoids to multipeaked ) and spanning a large range of pulsed fractions ( from less than 10% to nearly 100% ) .",
    "the pulse profiles are energy - dependent ( with a tendency toward more complex shapes with increasing energy ) and , in many sources , time - variable .",
    "changes in pulse profiles are often connected with bursts / flares and/or glitches , but also long term variations , apparently unrelated to particular events , have been observed .",
    "some examples of pulse profiles are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - pulses1 ] and [ fig - pulses2 ] .",
    "the spin - down of magnetars is attributed to the angular momentum carried away by ( time - variable ) magnetized outflows and to dipole radiation losses . in a twisted magnetosphere ,",
    "the latter effect produces a higher spin - down rate than in pulsars with dipolar field because the twist inflates the poloidal lines and increases the magnetic field at the light cylinder .",
    "variations in the spin - down rate have been detected in practically all the magnetars for which good timing data extending over long periods are available .",
    "the @xmath14 variations are generally smaller than @xmath1250% , but changes as large as a factor of ten over timescales of weeks have sometimes been observed @xcite .",
    "the variations in @xmath14 observed in several magnetars are a proof of the dynamic nature of their magnetospheres .",
    "since both the torque and the magnetospheric currents are driven by variations in the twisting of the field lines @xcite , some correlations between the spin - down rate and x - ray emission properties can be expected , and indeed they have been observed ( see section [ correlations ] ) .",
    "glitches have been observed in many magnetars @xcite .",
    "they involve fractional frequency changes @xmath18 , similar to those of the strongest glitches of radio pulsars @xcite , but the apparent paucity of magnetars glitches with smaller @xmath19 is probably a selection effect .",
    "the relation between magnetar glitches and observed changes in the properties of their x - ray radiation ( e.g. bursts , flux or pulse profile changes , etc ... ) is extensively discussed in @xcite . while the majority of radiative changes are associated with glitches ( or with some other timing anomaly ) , the converse is not true : several glitches seem to have no consequences on the emitted radiation .",
    "two sources showed episodes in which the spin frequency apparently jumped in a short time interval to a value significantly smaller than that predicted by the observed spin - down rate .",
    "these events with negative @xmath20 have been called antiglitches and can not be explained with the theories of normal glitches ( @xmath21 ) , which are based on the fact that the neutron star interior rotates faster than the crust and acts as an angular momentum reservoir .",
    "however , due to the sparse time sampling of the available data , it is not clear if these events are really occurring on a short timescale , as normal glitches .",
    "the first possible antiglitch , with @xmath22 , coincided with the august 1998 giant flare of   @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the pulse phases suggests that the frequency variation could have been caused by an increase of more than a factor 100 in the spin - down rate in a few hours after the giant flare @xcite .",
    "however , an alternative possibility requiring only a factor of two increase in the spin - down rate in the three months preceding the giant flare can not be ruled out . a more convincing case for a magnetar antiglitch , with @xmath23 and",
    "connected with a flux increase , has been recently reported for  @xcite .",
    "this prompted several interpretations , involving either a sudden event , like the collision with a solid body @xcite , or a rapid reconfiguration of the magnetosphere with the opening of some of the closed field lines and the emission of an enhanced particle wind @xcite .        .",
    "the inset in the lower left corner shows the pre - outburst pulse profile .",
    "only the relative strength of the different peaks can be inferred from these profiles , which are plotted in arbitrary flux units . ]          in fig.[fig - spectra ] we compare representative spectra of three different classes of neutron stars : a magnetar ( ) , a rotation - powered pulsar ( geminga ) , and an accretion - powered binary at low luminosity ( x persei ) . if we limit the comparison to the @xmath122 - 10 kev range , historically the first one to be explored , the most striking difference between these sources , is the softness of the magnetar spectrum .",
    "the first measured spectra of axps were in fact well fit by power - laws with photon indexes @xmath24@xmath1234 @xcite .",
    "this characteristic spectral softness gives an immediate diagnostics to recognize magnetar candidates among newly discovered x - ray pulsars .",
    "when data of better quality became available , it was found that a better phenomenological fit to the magnetar spectra below 10 kev is provided by a blackbody model with temperature kt@xmath250.5 kev , plus either a power - law or a second blackbody component @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of rotation - powered neutron stars , for which the thermal and non - thermal components dominate in different energy ranges ( see , e.g. , geminga in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ] ) , the higher temperature of magnetars implies that the blackbody and the power - law contribute in a similar way to the 1 - 10 kev flux , making more difficult to disentangle and constrain the two components .",
    "the requirement of a power - law in the soft x - ray range might simply reflect the inadequacy of a simple blackbody to fit a more complex thermal model , rather than representing a physically distinct process .",
    "for this reason , some caution is needed when drawing physical interpretations from some of the correlations between spectral parameters that have been reported in the literature .",
    "most magnetars are located at low galactic latitude and thus their spectra are strongly affected by the interstellar absorption , with large column densities n@xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the n@xmath28 values required by the blackbody plus power - law fits are often larger than those independently estimated in other ways , suggesting that the power - law can not be extrapolated to low energy without a cut - off .",
    "good fits are generally obtained with the sum of two - blackbody models , which can be interpreted in terms of regions with different temperatures on the star surface @xcite .",
    "thanks to its location in the small magellanic cloud ,  is the magnetar with the lowest interstellar absorption ( n@xmath29 @xmath27 ) and offers the best opportunity to study the x - ray emission at low energy : its spectrum is well fit by the two - blackbody model while the power - law plus blackbody is rejected with high confidence @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a power - law component is certainly present in the hard x - ray range .",
    "several magnetars have been detected up to @xmath12150 kev with large pulsed fractions and spectra flatter than those of accreting x - ray pulsars . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ] , the latter have exponential cut - offs at a few tens of kev while the spectra of magnetars extend to higher energies .",
    "the first studies of the ( non - bursting ) emission from axps / sgrs above @xmath1210 kev were carried out with the integral , rxte and suzaku satellites . despite the limited sensitivity and imaging capabilities of the instruments operating in this range , these observations were crucial to demonstrate that the hard x - ray emission represents a non - negligible fraction of the energy output from magnetars @xcite .",
    "more sensitive observations have been obtained in the last two years with the nustar satellite , thanks to the imaging capability provided by its focusing telescopes covering the 379 kev range .",
    "these observations allow to carry out spectral and variability analysis on short timescales and to spatially resolve the hard x - ray emission in crowded and/or confused regions @xcite    we can summarize the properties of the hard x - ray emission from magnetars as follows :    * the luminosity in the hard component is similar to that observed below 10 kev .",
    "* fits in the range @xmath1210 - 200 kev with power - law models give photon index values typically between @xmath30 and 2 ( except in the case of , which has @xmath31 , @xcite ) . *",
    "the flux upper limits derived in the mev region @xcite imply that the spectra can not extend as power laws to such high energies .",
    "indeed , the data with high statistics show that curved models , like a log - parabolic function , provide better fits than simple power laws @xcite .",
    "* the spectra of the pulsed component are harder than those of the total emission and show phase - dependent variations . *",
    "hard x - ray emission has been observed also in transient magnetars ( , @xcite ; , @xcite ; , @xcite ) . in the case of  the spectrum hardened as the flux decreased @xcite . *",
    "no detections at higher energy have been obtained .",
    "the upper limits derived with @xmath32 in the 0.1 - 10 gev range @xcite are incompatible with earlier predictions which assumed emission from the outer magnetospheres of axps / sgrs @xcite . searches for tev emission with",
    "ground based telescopes gave negative results @xcite .",
    "the above description of the magnetar spectra is based on simple phenomenological fits , but in recent years more physically - motivated models to interpret the observed broad band spectra have been developed @xcite .",
    "two main ingredients play an important role in these models : _ _ ( _ _ a ) thermal emission from ( a part of ) the neutron star surface , which is surrounded by a thin atmosphere , and _ _ ( _ _ b ) the presence of a magnetosphere with a complex geometry and significant charge density .",
    "the magnetosphere affects significantly the emerging spectrum and provides additional emission components due to the presence of accelerated charges . the surface thermal emission results from interior cooling powered by magnetic field dissipation and from external heating caused by backward - flowing charges in the magnetosphere .",
    "the presence of a relatively dense plasma in the magnetospheres with a twisted configuration , a distinguishing property of magnetars , has important implications for the emitted spectrum .",
    "resonant cyclotron scattering of the thermal photons can produce hard tails @xcite .",
    "first steps toward physical modeling taking into account the effects of the strong magnetic field on the thermal emission were done considering radiation transfer in a mono - dimensional approximation @xcite more realistic 3-d computations required a monte carlo approach to study the photon propagation in a globally twisted magnetosphere supporting the strong currents that provide a large optical depth to resonant cyclotron scattering @xcite .",
    "these models can successfully fit the observed spectra @xcite , but their validity above a few tens of kev is uncertain , because they are computed for non - relativistic ( or only mildly relativistic ) particle distributions .",
    "also the assumed geometry is probably oversimplified : the seed photons may have a non - uniform and time - variable temperature distribution over the star surface and the magnetospheric twist may involve only a limited bundle of field lines rather than being global .",
    "the modeling of phase - resolved spectra obtained during the evolution of transient magnetar outbursts is a promising approach which can give useful constrains on the models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". unfortunately , phase - resolved spectra of good statistical quality are not always available , especially in the hard x - ray range .",
    "a model for the hard x - ray spectra of magnetars has been developed by @xcite who numerically solved the radiative transfer of charged particles flowing in a large twisted magnetic loop .",
    "relativistic electrons ( @xmath5@xmath1210@xmath33 ) are injected by high voltage discharges close to the star surface and flow in the closed loop ( rather than along open field lines as in normal pulsars ) .",
    "the resulting emission , strongly beamed along the loop , has a hard power - law shape below the mev and is significantly suppressed at higher energy .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations , but the model parameters depend strongly on the geometry of the loop and orientation of the source @xcite . both phase - averaged and phase - resolved spectra of magnetars recently obtained with the @xmath34 satellite in the 4 - 80 kev range have been successfully fit by this model , which , however , does not yet include in a self - consistent way the low energy x - ray emission @xcite .     and",

    "the detection of cyclotron lines is the most direct way to measure the magnetic field of neutron stars .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to accreting neutron stars in x - ray binaries since the beginning of x - ray astronomy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for magnetic fields of b@xmath36 g ,",

    "could not be confirmed with more sensitive observations @xcite , implying either line variability or spurious detection .",
    "the best upper limits , obtained with  and , yield equivalent widths smaller than a few tens of ev @xcite .",
    "line smearing , caused , e.g. , by the superposition of emission from regions of different field strength , is possibly one of the effects that reduce the detectability of cyclotron lines .",
    "phase - resolved spectroscopy could mitigate this problem , but at the cost of a worse sensitivity due to the lower counts statistics of the spectra .",
    "the absorption line recently discovered in the transient magnetar   @xcite shows indeed a strong dependence on the star rotation phase and could be discovered only thanks to the examination of phase - energy images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-0418 ] ) . the line energy varies between @xmath121 and @xmath375 kev within a small interval of the spin phase .",
    "this strong phase - dependence disfavours an explanation in terms of a cyclotron line from electrons , which , given the dipolar field b@xmath38=@xmath39 g inferred from the timing parameters @xmath40=9.1 and @xmath14=4@xmath16 s s@xmath1 @xcite , should be at a height of a few stellar radii .",
    "a field of 10@xmath41 g at the star surface was inferred by fitting the x - ray spectrum of  with a magnetic atmosphere model @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the phase - dependent absorption line is best interpreted as a cyclotron feature from protons residing in a relatively small magnetic loop with b@xmath42 g , much higher than b@xmath38 .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , this result , besides providing a direct estimate of the magnetic field strength close to the surface of a magnetar , confirms the complex topology of the magnetosphere , in which global and/or localized twists , as predicted by the magnetar model , play an important role .",

    "this rate is broadly consistent with extragalactic estimates @xcite which are undifferentiated by galactic type , e.g.  comparative studies in the local volume which are limited statistically by the small number of events @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the birth of a magnetar is not an unusual event , especially if there is field decay ( see section [ evolution ] and @xcite ) .",
    "current estimates of the natal magnetic field distribution of neutron stars in general , based on population synthesis studies @xcite , zeeman spectropolarimetry of progenitors @xcite , and gravitational wave upper limits @xcite , are not sufficiently precise to pin down the shape of the distribution and test whether magnetars populate a second , high - field peak . in this section",
    "we present a brief summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the fossil and dynamo hypothesis for the origin of the magnetar magnetic field .",
    "the reader is referred to the paper by ferrario et al . in this volume and to the in - depth review by @xcite for more details .",
    "magnetic flux conservation during the collapse of a massive progenitor , e.g. a chemically peculiar star with radius 3r@xmath59 and a dipole magnetic field strength b@xmath60 @xmath12 10 kg , produces a natal neutron star magnetic field nominally as large as b @xmath61 g , enough to account for all known magnetars @xcite .",
    "the fossil field scenario is therefore economical as it does not invoke a separate mechanism to produce magnetars , which should naturally derive from the strong - field tail of the progenitor distribution .",
    "@xcite performed population synthesis calculations to show that the idea accounts also for the magnetization of strong - field white dwarfs , which exhibit similar mass - flux ratios .",
    "population synthesis computations also predict that magnetars originate preferentially from the most massive o stars , consistent with some magnetars being associated with massive star clusters @xcite and with their very small scale height on the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "therefore magnetars should be more massive than ordinary neutron stars , a claim which can not be tested observationally at present .    the nominal maximum field b @xmath12 @xmath62 g implied by magnetic flux conservation is hard to attain for three reasons .",
    "first , only the central @xmath12 2% by cross - sectional area of the progenitor collapses to form a protoneutron star , reducing b proportionally .",
    "second , there are too few progenitors with b@xmath63 10 kg to account for the magnetar birth rate inferred observationally @xcite .",
    "third , magnetic core - envelope coupling in the progenitor brakes the core too efficiently to explain the observed neutron star spin distribution @xcite and leaves no room for the magnetic - dipole braking evolution normally envisaged for magnetars unless supernova kicks play a role .",
    "( core - envelope coupling is an issue for the dynamo scenario too . )",
    "following flux compression , the magnetic field in a protoneutron star can be amplified further ( over @xmath12 10 s ) by dynamo action driven by convection @xcite or differential rotation @xcite .",
    "the relatively high ( @xmath57 10% ) incidence of progenitors with b@xmath63 0.25 kg from spectral class f0 to o4 @xcite ensures that a seed field is available .",
    "neutrino - driven convection leads to protoneutron star fields of about 10@xmath64 g for a neutrino luminosity of @xmath65erg s@xmath1 , which increases @xmath1210@xmath66-fold by flux conservation when the protoneutron star collapses to form a magnetar @xcite .",
    "however , these maximum field values are hard to attain , because dynamos typically operate at @xmath67 5% of equipartition @xcite and stratification quenches convection @xcite .    in contrast , counter - intuitively , a shear - driven dynamo operates more efficiently under stratification @xcite .",
    "the poloidal and toroidal field components grow in concert through the action of tayler and/or magnetorotational instabilities @xcite , as well as r - mode instabilities @xcite ; the same instabilities also prevent premature saturation caused by back - reaction stress from the wound - up toroidal field .",
    "differential rotation can also arise from binary mergers @xcite , and mean - field magnetohydrodynamics ( e.g. the @xmath68 effect and anisotropic resistivity ) and superfluid circulation to assist with amplification @xcite .",
    "we do not expect to see evidence for rapid rotation at birth in the current magnetar population due to magnetic braking .",
    "however , a rapidly rotating protomagnetar is expected to power an energetic , relativistic wind for @xmath12 10@xmath69 s after birth , whose energy content is deposited in the supernova remnant .",
    "x - ray observations of three supernova remnants associated with magnetars find no evidence for such  over - powering \" , implying initial spin periods @xmath57 5ms @xcite , although this conclusion assumes an idealized sedov expansion and neglects gravitational radiation which can nullify the over - powering issue @xcite .    in both dynamo scenarios ,",
    "magnetic flux tends to escape buoyantly from the dynamo region @xcite .",
    "indeed , most of the flux would be lost via this process , were it not for helicity conservation , which stabilizes the situation for linked poloidal - toroidal fields under a variety of conditions @xcite .",
    "in neutron stars endowed with strong magnetic fields , the temperature and magnetic field evolution are closely inter - related .",
    "on one hand , the dissipation rate of the magnetic field depends on the local value of the electrical resistivity , which is a quantity strongly dependent on temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the microphysics ingredients determining the temperature evolution ( heat capacity , thermal conductivity , neutrino emission rates ) are significantly modified by the presence of a strong field .",
    "a thorough and comprehensive discussion of all the aspects involved in the magneto - thermal evolution of neutron stars can be found in the recent work by @xcite , where the authors present results from simulations including two major novelties extending previous works @xcite : the proper treatment of the important hall term in the induction equation describing the magnetic field evolution @xcite , and updated microphysics inputs ( see * ? ? ? * for a review on matter properties in strong fields ) . in this section",
    ", we briefly summarize the equations , the method , and the updated ingredients of the simulations .      for our purposes ,",
    "the small structural deformations induced by rotation and magnetic field can be safely neglected . to include general relativistic effects",
    ", we consider the standard static metric @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the enclosed mass within radius @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the metric factor accounting for redshift corrections .",
    "the neutron star magneto - thermal evolution is described by the coupled system formed by the energy balance and the hall induction equations .",
    "the first reads : @xmath75 = e^{2\\nu}(-{\\cal q}_\\nu + { \\cal q}_h)\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the volumetric heat capacity , @xmath77 is the thermal conductivity tensor , @xmath78 are the energy losses by neutrino emission per unit volume , and @xmath79 is the joule heating rate per unit volume .",
    "this is the first important coupling between the two evolution equations , because @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the electrical current determined by the magnetic field geometry and @xmath82 the electrical conductivity .",
    "the second important effect of the presence of a strong magnetic field in the conduction of heat is the anisotropic conductivity tensor ( @xmath77 ) , and the last one is that the magnetic field also affects the rate of neutrino processes , @xmath78 .    in the crust ,",
    "ions form a coulomb lattice , while electrons are relativistic , degenerate and can almost freely flow , providing the currents that sustain the magnetic field .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field is governed by the hall induction equation which , using the same notation as in @xcite , has the form : @xmath83   \\times \\vec{b }    \\right]~\\ ] ] where the conductivity @xmath82 takes into account all the electron processes , which are strongly temperature - dependent , thus resulting in the strong coupling of the magnetic field evolution to the local evolution of temperature .",
    "the first term on the right hand side accounts for ohmic dissipation , while the second term is the hall term .",
    "the previous equation can be cast as @xmath84 \\right ) \\times \\vec{b }    \\right\\}~\\ ] ] where we have introduced the magnetic diffusivity @xmath85 and the magnetization parameter @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the gyration frequency of electrons , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the relaxation time and effective mass of electrons ) .",
    "this term regulates whether the evolution is dominated by the diffusive term or by the hall term . in the regime where @xmath90 ( strong magnetic fields , @xmath91 g , and temperatures @xmath92 k , see @xcite for more details ) , the hall term dominates , and the induction equation acquires a hyperbolic character .",
    "the ohmic and hall timescales vary by orders of magnitude within the crust and during the evolution , depending strongly on density , temperature , and magnetic field intensity and curvature .",
    "the main effect of the hall term is to transfer part of the magnetic energy from large to small scales , as well as between poloidal and toroidal components . in the case of strong toroidal components",
    ", it also leads to the formation of discontinuities of the tangential components of the magnetic field , i.e. current sheets , where the dissipation is strongly enhanced @xcite .",
    "this directly affects the thermal evolution through the term @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat_balance ] ) .",
    "the previous equations provide a proper description of the physics of the crust , once the microphysical input is provided . in the neutron star core , however , the situation is more complex .",
    "the core of neutron stars ( or at least a fraction of its volume ) is thought to be a type ii superconductor @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetic field in the core are not clearly understood .",
    "standard ohmic dissipation is irrelevant due to high conductivity , but other mechanisms such as the interplay between flux - tubes and vortices , magnetic buoyancy , or ambipolar diffusion may operate to expel magnetic flux from the core on timescales comparable to the thermal evolution timescale",
    ". the detailed study of these mechanisms is still lacking , and this explains why most previous works considered models with the field confined into the crust or used a very crude approach for the magnetic fields permeating the core @xcite .",
    "some basic issues as whether or not ambipolar diffusion plays any role at all are still under debate @xcite .",

    "diagram for magnetars and other classes of isolated neutron stars ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate theoretical evolutionary tracks for different values of the initial magnetic field .",
    "the points corresponding to true ages of @xmath95 and @xmath96 yrs are indicated by the asterisks on each lines .",
    "the dashed lines represent the evolution without magnetic field decay . ]      from detailed numerical simulations solving the above system of equations , one can in principle obtain the local temperature at each point of the neutron star surface and the integrated luminosity , to be compared to observations .",
    "but the reality is more complicated .",
    "although both luminosities and temperatures can be obtained by spectral analysis , it is usually difficult to determine them accurately .",
    "the luminosity is always subject to the uncertainty in the distance estimate , while the inferred effective temperature depends on the choice of the emission model ( blackbody vs. atmosphere models , composition , condensed surface , etc . ) , and it carries large theoretical uncertainties in the case of strong magnetic fields .",
    "it is often found that more than one model can fit equally well the data , without any clear , physically motivated preference for one of them .",
    "photoelectric absorption from interstellar medium further constitutes a source of error in temperature measurements , since the value of the hydrogen column density is covariant with the temperature value obtained in spectral fits .",
    "different choices for the absorption model and the metal abundances can also yield different results for the temperature . in addition , in the very common case of inhomogeneous surface temperature distributions , only an approximation with two or three regions at different temperatures is usually employed .",
    "moreover , in the case of data with few photons and/or strong absorption features , the temperature is poorly constrained by the fit , adding a large statistical error to the systematic one .    with all the previous caveats in mind , the studies of the magneto - thermal evolution of isolated nss ,",
    "have explored the influence of their initial magnetic field strength and geometry , their mass , envelope composition , and relevant microphysical parameters such as the impurity content of the innermost part of the crust ( the pasta region ) .",
    "the main findings can be summarised as follows ( see figures [ fig - cooling ] and [ fig - ppdot ] ) :    * _ dependence on the magnetic field strength : _ the comparison between a range of theoretical models and the observations @xcite , has shown that , for the objects born with relatively low fields ( @xmath97  g ) , the magnetic field has little effect on the luminosity . sources of this group , which includes most of the `` normal '' radio pulsars , have luminosities which are compatible with the predictions of standard cooling models .",
    "the bulk of the magnetars , with @xmath98 a few @xmath99  g ( as estimated from their timing parameters ) , display luminosities generally too high to be compatible with standard cooling alone . the magneto - thermal evolutionary models with @xmath100",
    "g can account for their range of luminosities at the corresponding inferred ages . as these objects evolve and their magnetic fields dissipate , their observational properties ( both timing and luminosities ) appear compatible with those of the xdins satellite ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a review of their properties ) . ] .",
    "* _ relevance of the hall term _ : the hall term plays a very important role in the overall magnetic field evolution , strongly enhancing the dissipation of energy over the first @xmath101  yr of neutron star life , with respect to the purely resistive case .",
    "this is due to two main effects : the generation of smaller structures and currents sheets , and the gradual compression of currents and toroidal field towards the crust / core interface .",
    "hence , the rate of field dissipation strongly depends on the resistivity given by the amount of impurities in the innermost region of the crust .",
    "a highly impure or amorphous inner crust produces a significant increase in the field dissipation on timescales @xmath102  yr . * _ standard vs. fast neutrino cooling scenarios _ : for weakly magnetized objects , low mass stars ( @xmath103 ) are systematically brighter than high mass stars , because fast neutrino processes are only active above a certain threshold density .",
    "this separation is smeared out for highly magnetized stars , for which the overwhelming effect of the magnetic field makes it hard to distinguish if fast neutrino cooling processes are acting or not , and therefore the mass dependence of the cooling curves is much smaller . * _ effect of the envelope composition : _ as a robust and general trend , light - element envelopes are able to maintain a higher luminosity ( up to an order of magnitude ) than iron envelopes for a long period of time , @xmath104  yr , regardless of the magnetic field strength . the most luminous magnetars , with estimated field strengths @xmath105",
    "g from their timing parameters , are barely compatible with the @xmath106  g cooling curve with an iron envelope .",
    "however , for the same initial magnetic field , a light envelope is able to account for the luminosity of even the brightest objects . * _ importance of the initial model _ : the initial magnetic field configuration plays a very important role in the observational properties of the ns . if the currents sustaining the magnetic field flow in the core , their dissipation is negliglible , comparable with models in which ( most of ) currents flow in the crust . in particular , the presence of an initial strong dipolar , toroidal field in the crust breaks the symmetry with respect to the equator , resulting in a hemisphere warmer than the other .",
    "if most of the initial currents are instead confined into the core , then the reduced heat deposition in the crust results in a much cooler surface compared to the case in which the @xmath107 field lives in the crust only . *",
    "_ influence in the magnetar outburst rate _ : the estimated outburst rate , resulting from breaking of the crust by the strong magnetic stresses , is found to be an increasing function of the initial magnetic field strength and a decreasing function of age ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more quantitative comparison between the simulations and the observations is still not possible , due to the lack of sufficient statistics in the data .",
    "although the currently known magnetars represent only a small fraction of the observed neutron star population , they are attracting increasing interest , both from the observational and theoretical point of view .",
    "this is certainly due to their striking variability properties , diversity of multiwavelength behavior and extreme physical conditions . in the last decades , they evolved from the status of poorly understood , exotic high - energy sources to become recognized as an important class of isolated neutron stars . although their general properties are well explained in the context of the magnetar scenario , many aspects are still poorly understood and often the observational data are not sufficient to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the transient nature of most of these sources implies that we have now discovered only a small fraction of the magnetar population .",
    "the presence of wide field of view instruments constantly monitoring the variable x/@xmath5-ray sky is extremely important to further progress in this field exploiting the improved capabilities of future observational facilities .",
