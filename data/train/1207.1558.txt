    "very slow conductance relaxations have been found during the last 20 years in some disordered insulators @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by two salient and related features : a slow decrease of the conductance after a quench of the samples at low temperature ( 4k ) and a conductance `` dip '' in electrical field effect measurements .",
    "the current and still partial understanding of these features is based on the electron glass hypothesis @xcite . according to theoretical studies @xcite ,",
    "a system of localized electrons with disorder and ill - screened interactions will need an infinite time to reach its equilibrium state at low temperature .",
    "the approach to equilibrium is associated with a decrease of the conductance , in qualitative agreement with the conductance relaxation observed after a quench at low temperature .",
    "let s precise what the conductance `` dip '' is with the example of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . a mosfet device which conducting channel",
    "is made of insulating granular al thin film ( see fig . [ figure2 ] ) was cooled down to @xmath0 and maintained under a fixed gate voltage @xmath1 for 2 hours .",
    "the gate voltage was then swept around @xmath2 at a constant scan rate and the @xmath3 curve was recorded",
    ". a symmetrical dip , centered on @xmath2 , is clearly visible and reflects the partial equilibration of the system under @xmath2 . out of the dip range ,",
    "i.e for @xmath4 , the conductance is roughly independent of the gate voltage and this baseline value @xmath5 can be used to defined the conductance dip amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 is also called ( wrongfully , see below ) the `` off equilibrium '' conductance since the system has never been allowed to equilibrate at these @xmath7 s .",
    "contrary to our previous studies which were mainly focused on the time evolution of the conductance dip @xcite , we want to discuss here the time evolution of the baseline value @xmath5 .",
    "as we will see , it contains interesting information about the granular al film properties .",

    "[ figure1 ] . ]",
    "the experimental challenge is to measure minute conductance variations of the granular al channel at a fixed low t and over days .",
    "since the relative amplitude of the conductance dip is of few percent or smaller , a relative precision of @xmath8 is required .",
    "the first problem is the t stability of the film during the measurement .",
    "since the films are insulating , their resistance diverges exponentially when the t is lowered .",
    "@xmath9 temperature variations in the liquid he range correspond typically to few % changes in the conductance of the films , which is of the order of the variations we would like to measure as a function of time .",
    "the following set - up was thus employed .",
    "all the samples were mounted in a tight box and plunged into a @xmath10 liquid he dewar .",
    "this box was either filled with some he exchange gas or let under vacuum . with he",
    "exchange gas , the quench to @xmath0 was fast ( @xmath11 from @xmath12 ) but then the film follows the @xmath9 variations of the liquid he bath around @xmath0 . a carbon glass thermometer close by was used to correct these t variations . under vacuum , the quench to low t was much longer ( few hours ) , but it was then possible to regulate the temperature with a high precision ( better than @xmath13 ) by using the carbon glass thermometer and a resistive heater .",
    "the available temperatures in that case are in the range @xmath14 .",
    "the second problem is the sensitivity of the electronic devices ( lock - in , current amplifier , etc . ) to room temperature drifts .",
    "for example , the current amplifier gain in the range @xmath15 - @xmath16 has a t drift of @xmath17 .",
    "we specially built a thermalized chamber with a t stability better than @xmath18 in which all the electronic devices were placed .",
    "doing so , we were able to detect conductance variations as small as @xmath19 over weeks of measurements .",
    "we have exclusively used granular al films made by electron gun evaporation of al under a partial pressure of @xmath20 , as described elsewhere @xcite . in order to build mosfet devices ,",
    "granular al films were deposited on top of heavily doped @xmath21 wafers ( the gate ) covered by a @xmath22 thick thermally grown @xmath23 layer .",
    "the film conductance was measured by using a two terminal ac technique , employing a femto current amplifier dlpca 200 , and a lock - in amplifier sr 7265 .",
    "the source - drain voltage was such that g stays in the ohmic regime .",
    "in order to measure the baseline @xmath5 time variations , we follow a simple experimental protocol .",
    "the mosfet devices are cooled down from room t to liquid he ( or to a t slightly above ) and once the t has reached the desired value , we measure @xmath3 curves around @xmath2 at constant time interval .",
    "the time between two sweeps is kept much larger than the sweep time , usually @xmath24 between two @xmath3 curves and @xmath25 for a @xmath26 sweep .",
    "a typical result for a @xmath27 thick film quenched with he exchange gas is shown in the fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] below . without any t corrections ,",
    "the observed baseline conductance variations of few @xmath28 mainly reflect the mk fluctuations of the he bath .",
    "interestingly , the dip amplitude is less sensitive to t so that t variations are small enough to allow a measurement of its time development .",
    "this is illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] where @xmath29 is plotted as a function of the time elapsed after the quench .",
    "the @xmath30 dependence reported and discussed in previous studies @xcite is clearly visible .",
    "corresponding amplitude of the conductance dip @xmath31 . ]     corresponding amplitude of the conductance dip @xmath31 . ]    if we now correct for the t variations of the he bath ( we can measure after a long time the g - t dependence ) , we get the curves shown in fig . [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] . both the baseline and the conductance minimum at @xmath2 decrease with a @xmath30 dependence .",
    "it will be noted that the curve of the fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] is simply the difference of the two @xmath30 curves of the fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .     corresponding @xmath32 curves at @xmath2 ( @xmath33 ) and out of the conductance dip region ( @xmath34 ) . ]     corresponding @xmath32 curves at @xmath2 ( @xmath33 ) and out of the conductance dip region ( @xmath34 ) . ]",
    "we checked that the @xmath2 values has no effect on the baseline decrease .",
    "quantitatively similar @xmath5 relaxations are observed in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] and [ figure8 ] when @xmath2 was first set to @xmath35 and then change to @xmath36 800 min after a quench to @xmath37 .",
    "two dips are visible in the @xmath3 curves , but for @xmath7 values far enough from @xmath38 and @xmath39 , a regular @xmath30 decrease of the conductance is obtained . during this run of measurement , we have also suspended the @xmath7 sweeps during 30 hours .",
    "no significant change in the baseline decrease is found which exonerates the @xmath7 sweeps in the g relaxations .     corresponding @xmath32 curves at different @xmath7 values .",

    "the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath40 reflects the well known approach of the system to equilibrium after a quench @xcite . but how can we understand the @xmath30 relaxation of the baseline ? in ref .",
    "@xcite , we described in details how a metallic - like screening length @xmath41 smaller than the thickness @xmath42 of the films ( @xmath27 for the previous figures ) can provide a simple explanation to the observed baseline relaxation . for a given @xmath7 , only the part of the film which is at a distance smaller than @xmath41 from the gate insulator will feel an electric field ( let s call it the `` unscreened '' layer )",
    ". the field in the other part of the film ( the `` screened '' layer ) will be much smaller .",
    "if the screening is much faster than the typical time scale of the @xmath7 changes ( @xmath43 ) , there wo nt be any electrostatic perturbation during a @xmath7 sweep in the `` screened '' layer .",
    "in other words , only the `` unscreened '' layer is pushed out of `` equilibrium '' by the @xmath7 sweeps . by assuming a parallel conduction for the different layers",
    ", we can say that the @xmath44 dependence of @xmath40 reflects the relaxation of the whole film ( `` screened '' and `` unscreened '' layers ) towards equilibrium , whereas the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath5 reflects the relaxation of the `` screened '' layer alone ( the relaxation of the `` unscreened '' layer is given by the conductance dip growth ) .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the slope ratio @xmath45 of the @xmath46 slope to the @xmath47 slope is given by : @xmath48 and can thus be used to estimate the @xmath41 value . in the fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , @xmath45 is equal to 2.3 , which gives @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we have measured this slope ratio at @xmath0 on other 20 nm thick granular al thin films with square resistances @xmath51 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the slope ratios were all found between 2 and 3 , corresponding to quite similar @xmath41 values in the range @xmath54 .",
    "this @xmath41 estimate of @xmath55 at @xmath56 was confirmed by the study of the @xmath3 relaxations for granular al films of different thicknesses @xcite .",
    "it lies between the percolation radius @xmath57 , estimated to be about @xmath58 at @xmath0 ( see below ) , and the typical grain size of al , which according to tem studies is in the range @xmath59 .",
    "the existence of a metallic - like screening length in our insulating films is not surprising .",
    "the films have a low but finite conductivity at low temperature .",
    "some electrons can thus move by hopping through the whole sample and screen an electric field .",
    "other electrons that remain localized during the time scale of the experiment give a dielectric - like screening contribution ( polarization ) .",
    "a transition between a metallic screening at high t , where most of the electrons are diffusive , and a slow dielectric response at low t , where most of the electrons remain localized in finite size clusters was indeed found in numerical studies of disordered insulators @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the frequency and the temperature dependence of the screening properties are different in our hopping system from the metal case . by measuring the slope ratio sr at different temperatures between @xmath0 and @xmath60 for the 20 nm thick film of the previous figures ( see fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] and [ figure10 ] ) , we found that @xmath41 decreases as the t ( and thus g ) increases .",
    "this increase can be described by a @xmath61 dependence predicted by some theoretical studies @xcite , but the uncertainty is large .",
    "the screening length values extracted from the slope ratios sr of fig . [ figure9 ] plotted versus @xmath61 . ]",
    "the screening length values extracted from the slope ratios sr of fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] plotted versus @xmath61 . ]",
    "we do not see any evidence for a large change with time in the effective screening length over the time scales probed by our experiment ( from @xmath62 to few days ) .",
    "since glassy effects represent only conductance changes of few percent or less , their contribution to the screening might also be small and not detectable by our experiments . according to theoretical studies of the electron glass ,",
    "the single electrons hops are believed to be fast ( maxwell time ) and could be responsible for the short time screening length measured here .",
    "much slower multi - electron hops will result in a slow decrease of the screening length as a function of time @xcite .    in light of these findings ,",
    "some of the results that were published before have to be quantitatively reconsidered .",
    "it is indeed the case of our percolation radius ( @xmath57 ) estimates obtained from the conductance fluctuations of @xmath27 thick mesoscopic films @xcite . since only the film layer located at a distance smaller than @xmath41 to the gate insulator is sensitive to @xmath7 changes , the @xmath57 values published in ref .",
    "@xcite must thus be divided by @xmath63 . due to the t dependence of the screening length highlighted in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , the actual decrease of the relative conductance dip amplitude @xmath64 as t is increased is weaker than it was published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we should say that no baseline relaxation was found in indium oxide films where similar measurements to ours have been made",
    ". published data concern films of 20 nm thick or less , and this will suggest a screening length larger than 20 nm",
    ". it would thus be interesting to measure thicker films to see if the screening length limit can be attained .",
    "such experiments are obviously not possible for ultrathin films of metals , in which the insulating character is due to their thinness .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated in our granular al insulating films the existence of a conductance relaxation which is undisturbed by a gate voltage change .",
    "this relaxation is observed after a quench at low temperature and obeys a @xmath30 dependence . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the comparison with the @xmath30 increase of the conductance dip amplitude allows an estimate of the metallic - like screening length of the films .",
    "this length is found to be of the order of @xmath65 at @xmath56 and to decrease as the temperature is increased .",
