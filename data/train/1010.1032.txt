    "after a slow start , photometric transit surveys have now provided over 100 transiting exoplanets ( esp ) ( as of october 2010 ) .",
    "tranist observations and follow - up radial velocity data strongly constrain the planets radii , masses and inclinations . such accurate physical parameters then allow investigation of the internal structures of these planets and possible clues to their formation mechanisms .",
    "the majority of transiting esp ( tesp ) have masses below 1.5m@xmath2 , although there are several at masses near 3m@xmath2 ( e.g. wasp-10 , hd 17156 , and corot-2 ) and a similar number above 3m@xmath2 , but even with higher mass objects like the 7.3 m@xmath2 wasp-14b @xcite and 8 m@xmath2 hd  147506b @xcite this higher mass region has been poorly explored .",
    "most tesp had radii near 1r@xmath2 , but many tesp had radii @xmath3 10% larger than expected for their mass , like hd  209458b @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to explain these larger than expected radii . @xcite",
    "found irradiation effects could significantly alter the radii of sub - jovain mass giant planets , but not explain the large radii for the planets with radii greater than 1.2@xmath4 , such as hd 209458b .",
    "additional authors have also considered inflation due to irradiation effects @xcite or other effects , like tidal forcing @xcite , and internal dissipation of tidal energy arising from orbital circularization @xcite but a consensus on an explanation for the inflated radii of these planets has not be reached .",
    "regardless of these mass - radius discrepancies , photometric surveys have now provided a large sample of transiting esp that can be used to determine their mass - radius relation and test current models for the structure and composition of esp .",
    "a recent parameterization to investigate possible classes of esp has been presented by @xcite using the safronov number for each system derived from the planet s equilibrium temperature , which is a function of its distance from its host star and the host stars effective temperature and radius . in this paper",
    "we present safronov numbers for the current sample of transiting exoplanets ( tesp ) and a comparison of this sample to some of the latest models for mass - radus relationships for exoplanets .",
    "we selected the 100 + transiting extra - solar planets ( tesp ) listed in the extrasolar planet encyclopedia  as of october 2010 .",
    "we plot the safronov number as a function of equilibrium temperature for the current sample of tesp in figure 1 .",
    "planets such as , hd  189733 , tres-3 , hat - p-7 , and xo-4 can be seen in range of safronov number between @xmath30.06 to 0.08 , noted as class i. esp such as , gj 436 , wasp-11b , hd  209458b , and hd  149026b fall in class ii with safronov number @xmath30.03 to 0.05 . there are a handful of plants have safronov numbers higher than those of class ii shown in figure 1 and these include wasp-7b and corot - exo-2 , and massive planets such as wasp-14b and hat - p-2 ( hd  147506b ) are located off of the plot at safronov numbers greater than 0.3 .",
    "the figure clearly shows these 2 classes noted by @xcite .    our plot of the safronov number as a function of equilibrium temperature ( figure 1 )",
    "does clearly show two classed of tesp .",
    "however , the significance of the gap observed in the safronov numbers is still under scrutiny .",
    "@xcite notes that since @xcite , additional extrasolar planet discoveries has led to the gap between the two classes of extrasolar planets weakening , and questions the statistical significance of the gap in safronov numbers .",
    "a more thorough evaluation of safronov numbers , by @xcite , contends that the gap is not presently statistically significant . @xcite",
    "also comment that there is no bimodal distribution of the two classes present in any other properties of extrasolar planets , raising questions as to if there actually are two separate classes of planets . more recently , southworth 2010 claims there is no significance to safronov numbers .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows a low but significant deviation for class i of 0.4 ( k - s statistic ) and class ii of 0.62 from the entire sample of 100 tesp planets , respectively .",
    "comparison of current models for mass - radius relations @xcite to the current sample of tesp ( figure 2 ) shows that the largest core masses have the smallest planetary radii and can be ruled out by the current sample of esp .",
    "a few esp in the current sample are consistent with 10 m@xmath1 cores for the smallest objects and several esp with radii near @xmath31 r@xmath2 have masses consistent with modes with no core mass .",
    "however , planets with radii @xmath5 1.2 r@xmath2 are inconsistent with the model behavior and may indicate another mechanism that inflates their radii @xcite .",
    "curiously planets with radii in the @xmath31.31.5 r@xmath2 range do lie along the @xcite models .",
    "the m - r plots hints there are two classes of esp , those with moderate core masses and @xmath61.2 r@xmath2 and a second class of inflated esp with radii @xmath51.2 r@xmath2 that are yet to be explained , although these may indicate another formation mechanism . the usefulness of safronov numbers is still being investigated .",
