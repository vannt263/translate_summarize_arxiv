    "one of the cornerstones of modern graph theory is turn s theorem , which gives the maximum number of edges in a graph on @xmath6 vertices with no complete subgraphs of order @xmath5 .",
    "this theorem has been extended in a number of different directions and we now have a good understanding of the corresponding question for other forbidden subgraphs , as long as they are not bipartite , and the structure of graphs close to the turn threshold .",
    "recall that the turn number @xmath11 is the maximum number of edges in a @xmath12-uniform hypergraph on @xmath6 vertices which does not have the complete @xmath12-uniform hypergraph on @xmath5 vertices as a subgraph .",
    "rademacher proved , but did not publish , see @xcite that any graph with @xmath13 edges contains at least @xmath14 triangles .",
    "erds later @xcite published a proof of this result and extended it by proving that for @xmath15 , for some constant @xmath16 , any graph with @xmath17 edges contains at least @xmath18 triangles .",
    "this result was later extended to graphs with density higher than @xmath19 , recently culminating in @xcite where the minimal number of triangles was determined for all densities .",
    "erds and dirac also observed that any graph with @xmath20 edges has @xmath21 , the complete graph with one edge removed , as a subgraph .",
    "this provides a strengthening of the result for triangles from @xcite in the sense that it shows that the graph contains two copies of @xmath22 which share two vertices",
    ".    in @xcite erds asked if these results could be generalized to 3-uniform hypergraphs as well    [ pr1 ] does every 3-uniform hypergraph on @xmath23 edges contain two @xmath24 ?    [ pr2 ] does every 3-uniform hypergraph on @xmath23 edges contain @xmath25 ?    in @xcite these questions , with an affirmative answer to both , were formulated as conjectures ,    the aim of this note is to show that the answer to both questions is no . for the first question we believe that the answer is yes for sufficiently large @xmath6 ,",
    "but as we shall see the second question fails even in an asymptotic sense .",
    "we first construct a family of hypergraphs which give a negative answer to the two questions for certain small values of @xmath6 .            1",
    ".   the vertex set of any @xmath30 in @xmath29 can not have one of the two non - edges as a subset .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be subsets of @xmath34 of size @xmath35 . since any vertex subset of size @xmath35 misses one vertex of @xmath29 at least one of @xmath32 and @xmath33 must have one of the two non - edges as a subset .",
    "since every subset of @xmath36 of size @xmath35 can have at most @xmath37 edges , we find by averaging that @xmath38 the number of edges in @xmath29 is @xmath39 and inequality [ eq1 ] shows that , since @xmath40 , the turn number @xmath41 is at most @xmath42 .      note that @xmath29 also provides a negative answer to a generalisation of both problems to @xmath12-graphs for @xmath45",
    ". however we believe that question 1 should have a positive answer for sufficiently large values of @xmath6      for problem [ pr2 ] the failure is not a small @xmath6 phenomenon , as our next theorem will imply .",
    "recall that the turn density @xmath48 of a @xmath12-uniform hypergraph @xmath0 is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the maximum number of edges in a @xmath12-uniform hypergraph on @xmath6 vertices which does not have @xmath0 as a subgraph .",
    "we note that a positive answer to problem [ pr2 ] requires that @xmath51 . for @xmath52",
    "we have the following lower bound ,      let @xmath43 be the 3-uniform hypergraph defined in our earlier example and let @xmath54 , for @xmath6 divisible by 9 , be the blow - up of @xmath43 with @xmath55 copies of vertex 1 in @xmath43 and @xmath56 copies of each of the other vertices in @xmath43 . three vertices @xmath57 form an edge in @xmath54 if @xmath58 is an edge in @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath54 does not contain a @xmath52 and a simple calculation shows that the number of edges in @xmath54 is @xmath59        we now define a 3-uniform hypergraph @xmath61 on the same vertex set as @xmath54 where @xmath62 is an edge if , @xmath63 and there is an edge from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in @xmath60 .",
    "an edge in @xmath60 not incident with vertex 1 gives rise to @xmath66 edges .",
    "an edge leading to vertex 1 gives rise to @xmath67 edges , and an edge leading from vertex 1 gives rise to @xmath68 edges .",
    "finally we let @xmath69 be the graph on the same vertex set as @xmath54 with all edges from @xmath54 and @xmath61 .",
    "the number of edges in @xmath69 is @xmath70 in order to prove the theorem we now need to show that @xmath69 does not contain @xmath52 .",
