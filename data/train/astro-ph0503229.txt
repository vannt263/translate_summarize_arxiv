    "a plethora of explanations have been proposed to address the production mechanism of ultra - high energy cosmic rays  @xcite . in the absence of a single model",
    "which is consistent with all data , the origin of these particles remains a mystery .",
    "clues to solve the mystery are not immediately forthcoming from the data , particularly since various experiments report mutually inconsistent results . in recent years",
    ", a somewhat confused picture regarding the energy spectrum and arrival direction distribution has been emerging . since 1998 , the agasa collaboration has consistently reported  @xcite a continuation of the spectrum beyond the expected greisen  zatsepin ",
    "kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite , which should arise at about @xmath5  gev if cosmic ray sources are at cosmological distances .",
    "in contrast , the most recent results from hires  @xcite describe a spectrum which is consistent with the expected gzk feature .",
    "this situation exposes the challenge posed by systematic errors in these types of measurements . further confusing the issue , the agasa collaboration reports observations of event clusters which have a chance probability smaller than 1% to arise from a random distribution  @xcite , whereas the recent analysis reported by the hires collaboration showed that their data are consistent with no clustering among the highest energy events  @xcite .",
    "deepening the mystery , recent hires data have been interpreted as a change in cosmic ray composition , from heavy nuclei to protons , at @xmath6  gev  @xcite .",
    "this is an order of magnitude lower in energy than the previous crossover deduced from the fly s eye data  @xcite .",
    "the end - point of the galactic flux is expected to be dominated by iron , as the large charge @xmath7 of heavy nuclei reduces their larmor radius ( containment scales linearly with @xmath8 ) and facilitates their acceleration to highest energy ( again scaling linearly with @xmath8 ) .",
    "the dominance of nuclei in the high energy region of the galactic flux carries the implication that any changeover to protons represents the onset of dominance by an extra - galactic component .",
    "the inference from this new hires data is therefore that the extra - galactic flux is beginning to dominate the galactic flux already at @xmath6  gev .",
    "significantly , this is well below @xmath9  gev  @xcite , the threshold energy for resonant @xmath10 energy - loss on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and so samples sources even at large redshift .",
    "the dominance of extra - galactic protons at lower energy can be consistent with recently corroborated structures in the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "a second knee , recognized originally in agasa data  @xcite , is now confirmed by the hires - mia collaboration  @xcite . at @xmath0  gev , the energy spectrum steepens from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "this steepening at the second knee can be explained  @xcite by energy losses of extra - galactic protons over cosmic distances , due to @xmath13 pair - production on the cmb .",
    "the theoretical threshold of the energy - loss feature occurs at @xmath0  gev , and therefore allows for proton dominance even below this energy .",
    "however , the hires data  @xcite seem to indicate a composition change coincident with the energy of the second knee ( from about 50% protons just below to 80% protons just above ) , and therefore argues for the beginning of extra - galactic proton dominance at the second knee .",
    "another feature in the cosmic ray spectrum is the ankle at @xmath14  gev where the spectrum flattens from @xmath12 to @xmath15 .",
    "this has been commonly identified with the onset of the extra - galactic flux in the past . in the aftermath of the new hires data",
    ", the ankle can now be interpreted as the minimum in the @xmath13 energy - loss feature .",
    "these changes in viewing the onset of the extra - galactic component have spurred a refitting of the cosmic ray data down to @xmath0  gev with appropriate propagation functions and extra - galactic injection spectra  @xcite .",
    "the major result is that the injection spectrum is significantly steeper than the standard @xmath2 predicted by fermi engines .",
    "this result has consequences for neutrino observation : predictions for both the cosmogenic fluxes ( produced via interactions of super - gzk cosmic - rays on the cmb ) and the direct neutrino luminosity from optically thin sources can be significantly modified . the implication for cosmogenic",
    "neutrinos has been discussed elsewhere  @xcite . in this paper",

    "[ egcrp ] with an estimate of the power density of cosmic rays assuming a `` low '' energy onset of dominance by an extra - galactic component .",

    "it is helpful to envision the cosmic ray engines as machines where protons are accelerated and ( possibly ) permanently confined by the magnetic fields of the acceleration region .",
    "the production of neutrons and charged pions and subsequent decay produces both neutrinos and cosmic rays : the former via @xmath20 ( and the conjugate process ) , the latter via neutron diffusion from the region of the confined protons . if the neutrino - emitting source also produces high energy cosmic rays , then pion production must be the principal agent for the high energy cutoff on the proton spectrum .",
    "conversely , since the protons must undergo sufficient acceleration , inelastic pion production needs to be small below the cutoff energy ; consequently , the plasma must be optically thin . since the interaction time for protons is greatly increased over that of neutrons because of magnetic confinement , the neutrons escape before interacting , and on decay give rise to the observed cosmic ray flux .",
    "the foregoing can be summarized as three conditions on the characteristic nucleon interaction time scale @xmath21 ; the neutron decay lifetime @xmath22 ; the characteristic cycle time of confinement @xmath23 ; and the total proton confinement time @xmath24 : @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 the first condition ensures that the protons attain sufficient energy .",
