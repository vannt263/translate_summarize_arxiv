    "fractals are an important concept characterizing the features of real systems , because they can model a broad range of objects in nature and society  @xcite . over the past few decades",
    ", fractals have attracted considerable interest from the physics community  @xcite . among numerous fractal classes ,",
    "the so - called regular fractals are an integral family of fractals .",
    "examples include the sierpinski gasket  @xcite , the koch snowflake  @xcite , the vicsek fractals  @xcite , and so on .",
    "these structures have received much attention  @xcite , and continue to be an active object of research  @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons for studying regular fractals is that one can obtain explicit closed - form solutions on a finite structure .",
    "another justification is that various problems intractable on euclidean lattices become solvable on regular fractals  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the exact solutions on regular fractals can provide useful insight different from that given by the approximate solutions for random fractals .",
    "a central issue , still debated , is to understand how the underlying geometrical and structural features influence various dynamics defined on complex systems , which has been considered to be an important problem in many interdisciplinary fields , e.g. network science  @xcite . amongst a plethora of fundamental dynamical processes ,",
    "random walks are crucial to a lot of branches of sciences and engineering and have appealed much interest  @xcite .",
    "a basic quantity relevant to random walks is first - passage time ( fpt )  @xcite , which is the expected time to hit a target node for the first time for a walker staring from a source node .",
    "it is a quantitative indicator to characterize the transport efficiency , and carries much information of random walks since many other quantities can be expressed in terms of it .",
    "thus , a growing number of studies have been concentrated on this interesting quantity  @xcite .    in view of the significance of regular fractals and random - walk dynamics ,",
    "many authors have devoted their endeavors to study random walk on regular fractals  @xcite , such as the sierpinski gasket  @xcite , the @xmath0fractal  @xcite , the vicsek fractals  @xcite , as well as the hierarchical lattice fractals  @xcite .",
    "the results of these investigations unveiled many unusual and exotic phenomena of random walks on regular fractals .",
    "but in the aspect of fpt , these studies only addressed the mean of fpts between part of the node pairs , e.g. , between a given node and all other nodes  @xcite , while the scaling for the fpt averaged over all pairs of nodes , often called global mean first - passage time ( gmfpt ) , in the regular fractals is still not well understood  @xcite , in spite that gmfpt provides comprehensive information of random walks on fractals and other media .    in this paper , we study analytically the discrete random walks on a class of treelike fractals  vicsek fractals , which are typical candidates for exact mathematical fractals and have received extensive interest  @xcite .",
    "we determine exactly the gmfpt between two nodes over the whole fractal family , which is verified by numerical results .",
    "the closed - form formula for the gmfpt is achieved iteratively by using the advantage of the specific construction of the vicsek fractals .",
    "the obtained explicit expression indicates that for large systems the gmfpt increases algebraically with the size of the systems . in the second part of this work",
    ", we provide the rigorous upper and lower bounds for gmfpt as a function of system size for general treelike media .",
    "we show that of all trees linear chains have the largest value of gmfpt and the star graphs have the smallest gmfpt .",
    "the so - called vicsek fractals are constructed in an iterative way  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) denote the vicsek fractals after @xmath4 iterations ( generations ) .",
    "the construction starts from ( @xmath5 ) a star - like cluster consisting of @xmath6 nodes arranged in a cross - wise pattern , where @xmath7 peripheral nodes are connected to a central node .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath8 . for @xmath9 , @xmath1",
    "is obtained from @xmath10 . to obtain @xmath11",
    ", we generate @xmath7 replicas of @xmath8 and arrange them around the periphery of the original @xmath8 , then we connect the central structure by @xmath7 additional links to the corner copy structure .",
    "these replication and connection steps are repeated infinitely , with the needed vicsek fractals obtained in the limit @xmath12 , whose fractal dimension is @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ net ] , we show schematically the structure of @xmath14 .",
    "according to the construction algorithm , at each step the number of nodes in the systems increases by a factor of @xmath6 , thus , we can easily know that the total number of nodes ( i.e. , network order or system size ) of @xmath1 is @xmath15 . since the whole family of vicsek fractals has a treelike structure , the total number of links in @xmath1 is @xmath16 .    .",
    "the open circles denote the starting structure @xmath17 . ]",
    "after introducing the vicsek fractals @xmath1 , we will continue to study numerically and analytically random walks performed on them , which is the primary topic of this present paper .",
    "the random - walk model we study is a simple one . assuming the time to be discrete , at each time step , the walker ( or particle ) jumps uniformly from its current location to one of its neighbors .",
    "the highly desirable quantity related to random walks is the gmfpt starting from a source point to a given target point , averaged over all node pairs of source and target points .",
    "the gmfpt can be obtained numerically but exactly via the pseudoinverse  @xcite of the laplacian matrix , @xmath18 , of @xmath1 .",
    "the entries @xmath19 of @xmath18 are defined as follows : the off - diagonal element @xmath20 if the pair of nodes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are linked to each other , otherwise @xmath23 ; while the diagonal entry @xmath24 ( degree of node @xmath21 ) .",
    "the pseudoinverse ( denoted by @xmath25 ) of @xmath18 is a variant of its inverse matrix and is defined to be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28-dimensional  one \" vector , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "the fpt between any pair of nodes in @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of the elements , @xmath30 , of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath31 stand for the fpt for random walks in @xmath1 , starting from node @xmath21 to node @xmath22 .",

    "thus , the sum , @xmath35 , for fpts between all node pairs in @xmath1 reads as @xmath36 and the gmfpt , @xmath37 , is @xmath38    using eqs .",

    "[ time01 ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ time01 ] , we can see that @xmath39 approximately grows exponentially in @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , @xmath37 is a power - law function of network order @xmath28 obeying the scaling as @xmath40 since @xmath15 .",
    "it should be mentioned that although the expression of eq .",
    "( [ hitting03 ] ) seems compact , it requires computing the inversion of a matrix of order @xmath41 [ see eq .",
    "( [ pinverse01 ] ) ] , which make heavy demands on time and computational resources for large networks .",

    "( [ hitting03 ] ) the gmfpt only for the first iterations . on the other hand , by using the method of pseudoinverse matrix it is difficult and even impossible to obtain the leading behavior of the exponent @xmath42 characterizing the random walks .",
    "it is thus of significant practical importance to seek for a computationally cheaper method for computing the gmfpt .",
    "fortunately , the particular construction of the vicsek fractals and the connection  @xcite between effective resistance and the fpts for random walks allow us to calculate analytically the gmfpt and the exponent @xmath42 to obtain rigorous solutions .",

( [ hitting02 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath45 using the previously obtained results  @xcite , the sum term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hitting06 ] ) denoted by @xmath46 can be recast as @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are all the nonzero eigenvalues of laplacian matrix , @xmath18 , of the vicsek fractals @xmath1 .",
    "then , we have @xmath50 having @xmath37 in terms of the sum of the reciprocal of all nonzero laplacian eigenvalues , the next step is to determine this sum .    the determination of all eigenvalues of @xmath18 can be resolved by using the real - space decimation method  @xcite .",
    "assuming that one has the eigenvalues @xmath48 ( @xmath51 ) at generation @xmath4 , then the eigenvalues @xmath52 of the next generation @xmath53 can be obtained through the relation  @xcite @xmath54 by solving eq .",

    "moreover , the newly generated eigenvalues keep the degeneracy of their ancestors . considering that all the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath8 are @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60",

    "notice that all these eigenvalues are either nondegenerate or degenerate  @xcite .",
    "the set of the former is denoted by @xmath66 , while the set of the latter is denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath68 .",

    "in what follows , for convenience we use @xmath66 to represent the nondegenerate eigenvalues of @xmath18 other than @xmath69 .",
    "we now return to derive @xmath62 , which can be evidently recast as @xmath72 we denote the two sums on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eigval03 ] ) by @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "below we will calculate the two quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we first calculate @xmath73 . at the initial generation @xmath70 , there is only one nondegenerate eigenvalue @xmath6 , which produces three different nondegenerate eigenvalues at generation @xmath75 .",
    "we call these three eigenvalues the first - generation descendants of @xmath6 , which give rise to @xmath76 second - generation descendants of @xmath6 at the third generation . thus , at @xmath21th generation , @xmath77 @xmath78th - generation descendants of @xmath6 are produced .",
    "since all eigenvalues ( degenerate or nondegenerate ) which appeared at one generation will still appear in all subsequent generations  @xcite , we have @xmath79 .",
    "hence , as noted above , @xmath66 consists of @xmath6 and all its offspring produced after generation 1 .",
    "let @xmath80 be the sum of the reciprocal of all the @xmath78th - generation descendants of @xmath6 .",

    "applying an approach similar to that used above , we can compute the sum of the reciprocal of its @xmath78th - generation descendants , which we represent by @xmath92 .",
    "after some simple algebra , we obtain @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , where @xmath95 express the reciprocal of the `` seed '' eigenvalue @xmath70 itself .",

    "we can also support the validity of eq .",
    "( [ hitting10 ] ) by using another method .",
    "in fact , the correctness of eq .",
    "( [ hitting10 ] ) depends on all the nonzero laplacian eigenvalues , the exactness for derivation of which can be established according to the relation between the laplacian eigenvalues and the number of spanning trees of a graph .",
    "it has been established that the number of spanning tress on a connected graph @xmath104 with order @xmath105 , @xmath106 , is related to all its nonzero laplacian eigenvalues @xmath107 ( assuming @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 ) , obeying the relation @xmath111  @xcite . since the vicsek fractals @xmath1 are trees , the product of all nonzero laplacian eigenvalues for @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath112 , should equal @xmath28 , which can be corroborated by the following argument . by definition , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) is the product of laplacian eigenvalues in @xmath116",
    "applying the vieta s formulae , we can easily obtained the product of the @xmath21th - order ( @xmath117 ) offspring of the `` seed '' eigenvalue @xmath6 is @xmath6 , which is independent of @xmath21 . then @xmath118 .",

    "we proceed to show how to represent gmfpt , @xmath121 , as a function of the network order @xmath28 , with the aim to obtain the relation between these two quantities . recalling @xmath15",
    ", we have @xmath122 that enables one to write @xmath37 in the following form : @xmath123\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{2(f+2)}{(f+1)(3f+2)}[(n_g)^{1+\\ln 3/\\ln ( f+1)}-1]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation  ( [ hitting11 ] ) unveils the explicit dependence relation of gmfpt on network order @xmath28 and parameter @xmath7 . for large systems ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath124 , we have following expression for the dominating term of @xmath37 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the spectral dimension of the viskek fractals  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the large limit of @xmath4 , the gmfpt grows approximately as a power - law function of network order @xmath28 with the exponent @xmath127 being a decreasing function of @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to see that the exponent @xmath42 is larger than 1 but not greater than 2 .",
    "particularly , when @xmath128 , @xmath42 reduces to 2 , which is the highest one reported thus far .",
    "in fact , 2 is largest exponent for gmfpt of random walks defined on treelike media , the rigorous proof of which will be given in the next section .",
    "in addition , it should be mentioned that the obtained superlinear dependence of gmfpt on the network order is in contrast with the other scalings previously observed for other media , e.g. , linear scaling for the apollonian networks  @xcite and the pseudofractal scale - free web  @xcite , a logarithmic correction to the linear dependence for small - world trees  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ time02 ] shows how the gmfpt scales with the network order for various parameter @xmath7 .",
    "( color online ) global mean first - passage time @xmath37 versus the network order @xmath28 on a log - log scale .",
    "the filled symbols described the analytic results shown in eq .",
    "( [ hitting10 ] ) .",
    "the solid lines represent the corresponding leading scaling given by eq .",
    "( [ hitting12 ] ) . ]",
    "iii , we have shown that the gmfpt in the vicsek fractals scales as a power - law function of network order .",
    "previous studies exhibited that gmfpt in other trees may depend on network order @xmath105 following different scalings .",
    "for example , in the deterministic uniform recursive trees , their gmfpt varies with network order @xmath105 as @xmath129  @xcite ; in the @xmath0fractal , the gmfpt grows as @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "these show that in different trees , the gmfpt obeys different dependence relation on network order .",
    "then , some natural questions arise : what are the upper and lower bounds for gmfpt in general trees ? in which trees are these bounds reached ?    as a matter of fact , the above questions are equivalent to find the upper and lower bounds for the total effective resistance , @xmath131 , as defined similarly by eq .",
    "( [ hitting08 ] ) .",
    "one can prove with ease using various methods  @xcite that for trees with order @xmath105 , the upper and lower bounds for @xmath132 are @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively .",
    "the upper bound can be only reached for the tree that is exactly a linear chain ( a path ) , which has two nodes with degree 1 at both ends of the chain and @xmath135 nodes with degree 2 in the middle  @xcite .",
    "actually , this linear chain is one of the particular viscek fractals corresponding to @xmath128 .",
    "the result provided by eq .",
    "( [ uppboun ] ) is compatible with that of the vicsek fractals corresponding to @xmath128 . as for the lower bound",
    ", it can be only achieved when the tree is a star graph  @xcite , consisting of one central node and @xmath136 leaf nodes .",
    "all these leaf nodes are linked to the central node , and there is no edge between the leaf nodes .    from eqs .",
    "( [ uppboun ] ) and  ( [ lowboun ] ) , we can easily obtain that the upper and lower bounds for gmfpt are @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively .",
    "thus , the gmfpt @xmath139 for general trees satisfies the relation @xmath140 . for large trees ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) , the leading scalings for @xmath142 and @xmath143 change separately with network order @xmath105 as @xmath144 and @xmath145 , implying that the scaling for the gmfpt in any tree must lie between linear scaling and square of network order .",
    "it is very obvious that the upper bound is much larger than the lower bound , the reasons for which lie with the underlying structures of the corresponding graphs : the linear chain is homogeneous , while the star graph is heterogeneous .    in the star graphs ,",
    "the central node has a very large degree , and thus plays a crucial role in keeping the whole graph together .",
    "when the random - walk process is performed in the star graphs , the walker has a tendency to migrate toward the central node , through which it jumps to the target nodes .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of random walks is very high in the star graphs , the linear scaling of the gmfpt with @xmath105 is the best we can see  @xcite .",
    "notice that the same scaling has been previously observed for complete graphs  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the star graphs can be obtained from the complete graph with the same order by whittling down complete graphs , i.e. , by the judiciously removing edges from complete graphs leaving only one node with @xmath136 connections , in order that the walker in the star graphs can find the destination nodes as easily as in the complete graphs .    on the contrary , in the linear chains all nodes are homogenous .",
    "when the walker starting from the source point to find the target node far away from the staring point , it must traverse all nodes between the starting point and the destination node .",
    "this makes the traverse time much longer than in the star graphs .",
    "finally , we should stress that although the star graphs are extreme of heterogenous media , they are very instructive to understand the dynamics of random walks on other heterogeneous graphs , especially scale - free networks  @xcite , which are ubiquitous in real natural and social systems  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that random walks in scale - free networks are very efficient  @xcite , the roots of which is actually can be heuristically explained as above .",
    "the large - degree nodes in scale - free networks play a similar role as that of the central node in the star graphs , making the gmfpt very small .",
    "we have studied the discrete random walks on the family of vicsek fractals , which includes the linear chains as a particular case . using the connection between the fpts and the laplacian eigenvalues for general graphs , we have computed the gmfpt averaged over all pairs of nodes in the fractals and obtained explicit solutions to the gmfpt .",
    "the obtained closed - form formula shows that in the limit of infinite network order @xmath105 , the gmfpt @xmath146 grows approximately as a power - law function of @xmath105 : @xmath147 .",
    "we have also provided rigorous bounds on the network order dependence of the gmfpt in general treelike networks .",
    "we showed that the upper and lower bounds can be achieved in linear chains and star graphs , respectively .",
