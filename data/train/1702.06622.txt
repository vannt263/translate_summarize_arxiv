    "the measurement was performed in the ( h , k , h ) scattering plane .",
    "it should be noted that , although there was finite temperature drift during measurements under pressure ( e.g. @xmath16=130(25)k ) , the observed behavior in lattice parameters ( fig.[latticepara_p](a ) ) is solely due to pressure rather than any possible temperature variation given that the change in both lattice parameters in the above mentioned temperature range at ambient pressure is almost negligible@xcite(temperature dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath19 lattice parameters at 130k are 4@xmath2610@xmath66k@xmath67 and 6.8@xmath2610@xmath68k@xmath67 respectively ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath20-lattice parameter should decrease with the decrease in temperature .",
    "in order to investigate the electronic and structural properties of cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , we performed density functional theory ( dft ) relativistic calculations using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite with the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) basis@xcite in the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) . in order to take into account , in the first approximation , the paramagnetic fluctuations that preserve the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice ( @xmath31 )",
    ", we consider a model with a `` frozen '' , twisted , long - range magnetic order which is one of the lowest - energy configurations with this symmetry ( see discussion below ) .",
    "pressure - dependent structures were obtained by fixing the components of the stress tensor to the given value ( equal to the external pressure ) and fully relaxing the lattice parameters and the internal atomic positions with the conjugate - gradient method@xcite .",
    "the integration over the irreducible brillouin zone was realized on the @xmath32-centered @xmath33 k - mesh .",
    "since the experimentally observed ambient pressure tetragonal cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0 manifests no signature of a structural or magnetic transition but does manifest a clear superconducting transition near 35k , we consider first the influence of pressure on the tetragonal non - magnetic phase .",
    "in addition , given that paramagnetic fluctuations generally play a role for the structural features of iron pnictides , we also simulated such fluctuations , to a first approximation , by imposing a `` frozen '' long - range magnetic order which , on the one hand , assists the structural collapse and , on the other hand , preserves the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal lattice . in this respect ,",
    "the usual stripe - ordered phase is not suitable for these simulations , as it breaks the tetragonal symmetry .",
    "recent works@xcite propose a few candidates for the magnetic order in iron pnictides , including spin vortex and charge - spin density wave orders , which have the @xmath69 symmetry opposed to the conventional @xmath70 order often found in the _",
    "_ a__fe@xmath5as@xmath5 compounds .",
    "in addition to these , we considered a few other magnetic configurations , including the checkerboard arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ f : supercells](a ) ) , and found that one of the lowest - energy states is a twisted phase with fe moments lying in - plane within each feas layer ( fig .",
    "[ f : supercells](b ) ) . while the fe moments in each feas layer are twisted around the _ c",
    "_ crystallographic axis , the nearest fe neighbors from the adjacent layer are oriented in the opposite direction . here , the local symmetry of each fe site is orthorhomic , since the spins are oriented either along the _ a _ or along the _ b _ axis , while the overall unit cell symmetry is tetragonal .",
    "marginal deviations ( @xmath71 ) from the 90-tetragonal lattice are observed in our calculations most likely due to the spin - lattice coupling .",
    "we note that , if the structure is not restricted to the tetragonal symmetry class , the stripe phase lowers the energy .",
    "nevertheless , in order to agree with the experimentally determined crystal symmetry of cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite , we study in more details the proposed twisted phase ( fig .  [ f : supercells](b ) ) as an approximate model of paramagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the long - range magnetic order in our simulations is necessary to reproduce the main features of the experimentally discovered collapse transition around 4  gpa .",
    "however , the imposition of an artificial magnetic order in cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , which in reality has a superconducting ground state with no known , long range magnetic order , creates an additional feature at higher pressures which is solely due to the theoretically imposed long - range order and should not be ( and is not ) observed experimentally . upon crossing the transition point at 4  gpa , the fe magnetic moments become gradually suppressed and vanish completely at 5.2  gpa creating a further drop of the _ c _ parameter ( fig .",
    "[ f : structure - vs - pressure](a ) ) . for the magnetic and non - magnetic optimized structures , we calculated the pressure - dependent enthalpies with the same vasp parameters as described in the main text and analyzed the enthalpy difference between the two phases , in order to find a first - order transition point .",
    "this enthalpy analysis shows that the magnetic order is , in fact , destabilized already after 4.5  gpa , where the first - order transition between the twisted magnetic and the non - magnetic phase occurs .",
    "one can argue that the pressure range between 4.5  gpa and 5.2  gpa is the metastability region for the studied non - collinear magnetic configuration ( indicated by the light - shaded region in fig .",
    "[ f : structure - vs - pressure](a ) ) .    to emphasize the role of the in - plane fe spin orientation",
    ", we compare this twisted - order model to another configuration preserving the tetragonal symmetry , namely , the collinear checkerboard magnetic arrangement ( fig .  [ f : supercells](a ) ) in terms of its evolution under pressure .",
    "our simulations of the collinear state revealed no abrupt changes in the lattice parameters within the same pressure range and show only gradual decrease of fe magnetic moments upon reaching 5  gpa .",
    "the checkerboard model is , therefore , not suitable for describing the structural transitions in the cakfe@xmath0as@xmath0 compound .      for selected pressures ,",
    "the non - spin polarized band structure was calculated for the optimized lattice parameters and as positions using the all - electron full - potential localized orbitals basis set ( fplo ) code  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the as - orbital weight near the fermi energy allowed the identification of the respective collapse transitions .",
    "in particular , upon reaching the pressure of 4  gpa , the antibonding as-@xmath51 molecular orbital near ca is shifted above the fermi level ( fig .",
    "[ f : collapse_near_ca_and_k](a ) ) and , as a result , the corresponding as - as bonding becomes stronger . to illustrate this effect in the real space , we calculated the electron density maps associated to these orbitals by means of the tricubic interpolation  @xcite of the wannier functions obtained using the fplo code@xcite . on these maps , clear enhancement of the electron density between the two as ions",
    "is observed around 4  gpa ( fig .",
    "[ f : collapse_near_ca_and_k](b ) ) .",
    "as expected , further increase of pressure produces no qualitative changes in the orbital picture for this spatial region .         for",
    "as - as bonding across the k layer , on the other hand , the collapse occurs at much higher pressures , around 12  gpa .",
    "this fact is evidenced by the band structure plots ( fig .  [",
    "f : collapse_near_ca_and_k](c ) ) where the as - derived molecular orbital near k crosses the fermi level upon increasing pressure .",
    "figure[f : collapse_near_ca_and_k](d ) makes it abundantly apparent that there is no qualitative change in as - as bonding across the k - layer anywhere near 4gpa . instead",
    ", the two as orbitals only clearly overlap across the k layer for @xmath1@xmath1312.4  gpa ( fig .",
    "[ f : collapse_near_ca_and_k](d ) ) .",
    "thus , our computational results clearly indicate that the @xmath134gpa transition is associated with a half - collapsed - tetragonal phase being stabilized .",

    "<S> the superconducting transition width , @xmath37=@xmath38 , is broadened with the increase of pressure as illustrated by fig.[lowt_phase](d ) , but this can be , in part , due to pressure inhomogeneities in the pressure medium , rather than represent any sort of phase transition . in order to search for a possible transition we compare zero field and moderate , but finite field ( @xmath45=30koe@xmath43@xmath15 ) resistive transition width data . </S>",
