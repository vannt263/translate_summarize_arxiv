    "in this paper we aim to determine the multiplicity - free permutation representations of the symmetric groups .",
    "this question of which subgroups of the symmetric group have a multiplicity - free permutation representation arose from the combinatorial problem of determining the largest collection of set - partitions with a specific type of intersection .",
    "we will start by describing the combinatorial problem and stating our results and then explain how it is related to the multiplicity - free representations of the symmetric group .",
    "all the calculations performed in this paper are done using the computational discrete algebra system gap  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be integers with @xmath1 .",
    "a _ uniform @xmath2-partition of an @xmath3-set _ is a set - partition of the @xmath3-set into @xmath2 classes each of cardinality @xmath4 .",
    "we say two such partitions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are _ qualitatively independent _ if each cell of @xmath5 and each cell of @xmath6 have at least one element in common . for practical reasons ,",
    "we want large sets of pairwise qualitatively independent partitions  @xcite .    the _ qualitative independence graph _ @xmath7 is the graph whose vertices are the uniform @xmath2-partitions , where two partitions are adjacent if they are qualitatively independent . in this",
    "setting , our problem is to find the cliques of maximum size in @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath8 the problem is trivial since the graph @xmath9 is a clique .",
    "for @xmath2 a prime power , the size of the maximum clique of @xmath10 is known to be @xmath11 ( @xcite , section 5.4 ) .",
    "very few bounds on the clique size of @xmath7 are known for other values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "one approach is to make use use of a family of graphs that generalises the graphs @xmath7 . if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two uniform @xmath2-partitions , their _ meet table _ is the @xmath12 array with the @xmath13 entry @xmath14 .",
    "two meet tables are _ isomorphic _ if we can obtain one from the other by permuting its rows and columns .",
    "different orderings on the classes in the partitions @xmath5 and @xmath6 could produce different , but isomorphic meet tables . note that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are qualitatively independent if and only if all entries of their meet table are positive .    for each possible meet table",
    "@xmath15 , we define a graph whose vertices are the uniform partitions , where two partitions are adjacent if their meet table is isomorphic to @xmath15 . for example , if @xmath16 and all entries in @xmath15 are equal to one , then the corresponding graph is @xmath10 .",
    "thus we have a family of graphs , one for each meet table , whose edges partition the edges of the complete graph on the uniform partitions .",
    "if the adjacency matrices of these graphs commute , then standard eigenvalue methods can be used to obtain bounds on the maximum sizes of cliques .",
    "mathon and rosa  @xcite show that for @xmath17 and @xmath18 that the family of adjacency matrices of these graphs is commutative .",
    "this result is used by godsil and newman to prove that the graph @xmath19 is a core  @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured in  @xcite that the graph @xmath10 is a core for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "a first step towards this is to determine if the adjacency matrices of these graphs for @xmath16 commute for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "how can we decide if these matrices commute ?",
    "the key fact is that the symmetric group @xmath20 acts as a group of permutations on the set of uniform partitions , and the matrices we have just defined commute with each other if and only if this permutation representation is _ multiplicity free _ , that is , each irreducible representation of @xmath20 occurs in it with multiplicity 0 or 1 .",
    "( see @xcite , section 29 . )",
    "we have determined all multiplicity - free permutation representations of the symmetric group .",
    "saxl  @xcite gives a list of all the possible subgroups of @xmath20 for @xmath21 which could be multiplicity - free .",
    "our work extends saxl s list not only by including groups acting on fewer than 18 points but also by determining exactly which groups in his list are multiplicity free .",
    "mark wildon  @xcite has also determined which of the groups in saxl s list are multiplicity free , his focus is on groups acting on at least 66 points .",
    "( saxl  @xcite)[saxl ] let @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 is multiplicity free , then one of the following holds :    a.   @xmath25 for some @xmath2 with @xmath26 ; b.   @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; c.   @xmath27 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 \\leq 4 $ ] ; d.   @xmath31 and @xmath24 fixes a point of @xmath32 $ ] and is one of the subgroups in ( ii ) or ( iii ) on the rest of @xmath32 $ ] ; e.   @xmath33 where @xmath34 or 9 and @xmath35 is @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 respectively .",
    "bannai  @xcite determined all the maximal subgroups with permutation rank less than or equal to five of the finite symmetric groups .",
    "all of these representations are multiplicity free and , naturally , occur in our list as well .",
    "there are several infinite families of groups whose permutation representations is multiplicity free and a long list of groups that do not belong to any of these families .",
    "a complete list of the groups can be found in the tables in the appendix .",
    "table  [ table : transitive ] is a list of all the transitive primitive subgroups .",
