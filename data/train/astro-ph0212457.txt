    "; bromm , coppi and larson 1999 ; abel , bryan and norman 2000 , 2001 ) . whether these smallest objects will allow a significant fraction of the baryons to participate in primordial star formation is unclear because of the effect of complex radiative feedback processes on molecular hydrogen formation ( haiman , abel and rees 2000 ; ciardi , ferrara , abel 2000 ; mahacek , bryan and abel 2001 , glover and brand 2001 ) .",
    "however , the early formation of even a few stars in such low - mass objects may significantly affect the evolution of their baryon content due to supernova explosions driving a significant fraction of the gas away from the gravitational potential of the host .",

    ", the possibility that supernovae may remove a significant fraction of the gas present in dwarf galaxies was discussed by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) and by couchman & rees ( 1986 ) .",
    "further analytical treatment of such supernova - driven winds was presented by babul & rees ( 1992 ) and efstathiou ( 1992 ) .",
    "star formation and feedback have also been studied in the context of cosmological structure formation simulations .",
    "however , the efficiency of supernova energy feedback in driving the gas out of the dark matter potentials was found to depend on the details of the feedback prescription : katz ( 1992 ) and weinberg , hernquist & katz ( 1997 ) found that the properties of their simulated galaxies were insensitive to the inclusion of star formation and feedback to the simulations .",
    "navarro & white ( 1993 ) and navarro & steinmetz ( 1999 , 2000 ) found that the effect of supernova feedback depends on whether the energy returned to the ism is in the form of thermal or kinetic energy . in the former case ,",
    "the energy was quickly radiated away and the effect of feedback was minimal , while in the latter case feedback was efficient in driving gas away from the dark matter potentials and in suppressing star formation .",
    "in addition , mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) and navarro & steinmetz ( 2000 ) found that the effect of feedback depends on the total mass of the system under consideration , with the low - mass systems being affected much more than the higher - mass systems .",
    "energy feedback from supernovae is also believed to have a significant effect on the metallicities of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the idea of metals being driven away from galaxies is supported by observations of the chemical enrichment of the igm ( e.g. ellison et al .",

    "prada & burkert ( 2002 ) have summarized a correlation between mass - to - light ratio and metallicity of dwarf spheroidals , which they attribute to metal loss being more efficient for objects with shallower potential wells .",
    "the ability of supernova - driven winds to remove metals from galaxies has been studied by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) and by aguirre et  al .",
    "mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) modeled the effects of repeated supernova explosions from starbursts in dwarf galaxies with hydrodynamic simulations performed in a pre - determined dark matter gravitational potential and with an initial baryon - to - gas mass ratio extrapolated from observations of higher mass systems .",
    "their results suggest that galactic winds are very efficient in removing metals from dwarf galaxies , with the effect being more pronounced for the least massive objects . for larger energy ejection rates ( mac low &",
    "ferrera considered star formation rates only up to about 0.004 @xmath2/year ) , the gas in the galaxy can be completely blown away ( mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ) .",
    "aguirre et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) used results from completed n - body + hydrodynamic simulations including star formation which , however , did not directly incorporate the result of feedback , and assumed a series of ad hoc algorithms to reconstruct the metal enrichment process starting from the star formation history in each simulated object .",
    "they found that most galaxies at redshift @xmath3 should exhibit winds driving metals away from their gravitational potentials and enriching the igm with metals .",
    "note that such winds can now be studied directly using aborption spectra of quasars behind lyman break galaxies ( adelberger et al . 2002 ) .",
    "an additional factor affecting the baryon contents of dwarf galaxies is photoionization .",
    "the jeans mass prior to reionization is approximately a factor @xmath4 smaller than after , i.e. the minimum masses of dark matter halos that can confine baryons are much less at times before the intergalactic medium has been ionized .",
    "efstathiou ( 1992 ) and babul & rees ( 1992 ) discussed analytically the possibility that a photoionizing background might significantly affect the formation of dwarf galaxies and may be the mechanism preventing the collapse of most of the baryonic material into subgalactic objects at high redshifts .",
    "thoul and weinberg ( 1996 ) showed , using a one  dimensional hydrodynamics code , that photo - ionization affects the collapse of gas into dark halos with velocity dispersions even in excess of @xmath5 .",
    "kepner , babul and spergel ( 1997 ) have looked at the formation of molecular hydrogen in the cores of proto  dwarf galaxies and kepner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) investigated observational consequences of the picture of delayed dwarf galaxy formation .",

    "galactic uv background radiation field decreases .",
    "gnedin ( 2000 ) studied the effect of photoionization on the gas fraction of low - mass objects and found a deviation from the universal baryon fraction at low masses .",

    "interestingly , existing data on such systems favors the existence of such dark matter substructure ( metcalf and zhao 2002 , dalal and kochanek 2002 ) .    in this paper , we use high - mass resolution , 3-dimensional hydrodynamic amr simulations to examine the effect of stellar feedback and photoionization on the gas content , star formation histories and metallicities of dwarf galaxies down to a redshift of 3 . star formation and feedback",

    "4 we present the effects of feedback and reionization on the baryon contents , star formation histories and metallicities of individual halos . finally , we discuss our findings in  5 .",
    "we have used the 3-d amr cosmology code described by bryan & norman ( 1997a ) , norman and bryan ( 1999 ) , bryan , abel and norman ( 2001 ) .",
    "the amr algorithm used is similar to the one described by berger and collela ( 1989 ) .",
    "it utilizes an adaptive hierarchy of grid patches at various levels of resolution .",
    "each rectangular grid patch covers the region of space in its parent grid needing higher resolution , and may itself become the parent grid to an even higher resolution child grid .",
    "initial and boundary conditions are obtained by interpolation from the parent grid when the child grid is created .    in the simulations presented in this paper",
    ", we limited the refinement to 9 levels in a @xmath6 top grid .",
    "however , at the end of each run , only 7 levels of refinement had been used , so our simulations were not resource bounded .",
    "we have used a box size of @xmath7 mpc comoving , which was chosen as a compromise between high mass resolution and reasonable volume . the maximum spatial resolution",
    "( i.e. minimum cell size ) achieved was 610@xmath8 comoving pc or better than 150 proper pc for the redshifts simulated .",
    "the dark matter mass resolution was @xmath9 .    while this resolution is insufficient to model the detailed internal structure of the galaxies and the way that feedback works on pc scales , it is enough to correctly model the conversion of sn energy into high - velocity outflows which affect the gas surrounding ( and infalling into ) galaxies . for a more detailed examination of the impact of a burst of sn within a single high - redshift halo of this mass ,",
    "see mori , ferrara & madau ( 2002 ) ; their results support our findings that massive outflows are common around starbursting galaxies .",
    "the simulations were set up as a flat @xmath0cdm  model with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the total matter density consists of a baryonic and a dark matter component , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the present - day value of the dimensionless hubble parameter was @xmath14 in units of @xmath15 .",
    "the simulations were initialized at redshift 60 and terminated at redshift 3 .",
    "the cosmological density field was initialized using power spectra for the dark matter and the baryons given by the fitting functions of eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",
    "our simulations have allowed for star formation , however radiation feedback from the formed `` stars '' was not taken into account - instead , the simulation implements a homogeneous radiation field of haardt & madau type ( haardt and madau 1996 ) , with an index of @xmath16 , i.e. full reionization occurs in our models at @xmath17 .",
    "we also solve the non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling from hydrogen and helium and their ions ( abel et al .",
    "1997 , anninos et al .",
    "cooling from metal lines has been approximated by assuming collisional equlibrium .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the case of galaxy formation radiative processes may strongly affect the ionization balances and hence the cooling rates .    in order to allow for star formation ,",
    "given that it is not feasible to directly simulate the formation of individual stars since the range of scales and additional physics required to do so is prohibitive , a parametric method was adopted which attempts to model star - forming regions following a prescription similar to the one introduced by cen and ostriker ( 1992 ) . a detailed description of the implementation of the star - formation and feedback scheme can be found in oshea et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "groups of stars forming are treated as pressureless particles which return feedback to the surrounding medium ( star particles ) . for a star particle to be created , the following criteria need to be met :    1 .",
    "the baryon density at the particular grid where the star particle is to be created exceeds the mean density in the universe by a predefined factor , set to be equal to 100 in our simulation .",
    "the gas in the particular grid cell has @xmath18 , i.e. the gas is infalling rather than expanding ( or @xmath19 k ) .",
    "3 .   the cooling timescale for the gas is smaller than the dynamical collapse timescale .",
    "the baryonic mass in the cell exceeds the local jeans mass .",
    "the mass of the star particle to be created is calculated as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the baryon mass of the cell , @xmath22 is the duration of a timestep , @xmath23 is the dynamical collapse timescale and @xmath24 is the `` star formation efficiency '' ( fraction of mass of the initial cloud which is converted into stars ) , set equal to 80% in this simulation .",
    "this value of @xmath24 is significantly larger than values expected in realistic systems but we have used it in order to investigate the limiting case as to the maximal effect of feedback .",
    "additionally , we never allow more than @xmath25 of the mass in a cell to be converted to stars .",
    "conditions 1 - 4 are necessary but not sufficient for a star particle to be formed : in order to prevent the formation of an excessive number of star particles which would require a prohibitively high amount of computational resources in order to be followed , a minimum star particle mass @xmath26 is introduced . a star particle is formed in a cell fulfilling the criteria 1 - 4 only if @xmath27 exceeds this minimum mass .",
    "the value of @xmath26 we used was @xmath28 . however , since the minimum mass requirement is associated with computational resources limitations rather than underlying physics , a `` bypass mechanism '' for this restriction was included in the algorithm to account for small - mass star particles which should have been created on physical grounds : there is a certain probability per time step that a star particle with mass lower than the minimum mass threshold is created in a cell fulfilling the requirements 1 - 4 but not the minimum mass requirement .",
    "this probability is equal to the ratio of the mass of the star particle that would be created in the cell over the minimum star particle threshold .    to avoid the unphysical situation of forming a star particle ( corresponding to a cluster of stars ) instantaneously ,",
    "a more reasonable star formation history has been assigned to each cold collapsing cloud .",
    "therefore , each star particle @xmath29 is assumed to have a time - dependent star formation rate of @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the time of creation of the star particle and @xmath32 $ ] , with @xmath23 being the dynamical time from equation ( [ mstar ] ) .",
    "thus , one observes a rapid star formation after a dynamical time with an exponential tail at longer times . if @xmath23 is shorter than the small but non - zero life - span of massive stars , an estimate of the latter ( here taken to be 10 myrs ) is used in place of @xmath23 .",
    "the star particles formed give energy , metals and momentum feedback to the baryon gas .",
    "the energy equivalent to @xmath33 of the rest mass energy of the stars generated is converted into thermal energy ( this corresponds to 1 sne of @xmath34 erg for every 55m@xmath35 of stars being formed ) over a time period corresponding to the dynamical time from equation ( [ mstar ] ) and is put directly into the thermal energy of the cell in which the star particle resides .",
    "metals are also returned to the gas over the same time period and the yield ( mass of metals generated per mass of stars created ) is 0.02 .",
    "the mass fraction of created stars which is returned to the gas phase is 25% .",
    "the values for the parameters of our star formation algorithm are taken from cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) .    in order to better understand which",
    "effects in the output of our simulation can be attributed to the feedback from the star particles to the baryonic gas , we have run a second , control simulation , with the exact same cosmological parameters and initial conditions as our original simulation , in which stellar particles are born following the exact same recipe as before , but they do not return energy , momentum or metals to the gas . in the following sections we will present and compare results from both simulations .",
    "we will refer to the original simulation ( the one which allows for stellar feedback ) as `` feedback run '' and to the control simulation ( the one without stellar feedback ) as `` no - feedback run '' .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two simulations presented here are both limiting cases as far as feedback is concerned , in the sense that in our original simulation the feedback from each individual star particle is rather overestimated compared to theoretical expectations for realistic physical systems , while in our second ( control ) simulation the feedback is entirely absent .",
    "[ fig : gsfr ] gives the global star formation rate in our simulated box ( in @xmath36 per year per comoving @xmath37 ) as a function of redshift .",
    "in the same plot , we have overplotted observational data points compiled by blain ( 2001 ) .",
    "the observational points are meant to give a feeling of the magnitude of the star formation rate density in our box in terms of the corresponding quantity observed in the real universe rather than serve as an observational test for our model .",
    "the unrealistically large value of the star formation efficiency , combined with the small box size , can result to rapid gas depletion , causing the cosmic star formation rate to peak at too high a redshift and therefore a direct comparison between our results and the observational data points can be misleading . with these caveats in mind , it is nevertheless interesting to note that the magnitude of the cosmic star formation rate as derived from our simulations is comparable with that of the observational data over a considerable range of redshifts .",
    "the overall star formation rate is significantly larger in the no - feedback case : allowing sn to inject energy into the ism causes strong galactic winds which drive the baryonic gas away from the halos , while at the same time contributing to the increase of the temperature and pressure in the ism , hindering the process of star formation . as a result , the global star formation rate can take much larger values in the no - feedback run .    in both runs , there is a change of slope of the cosmic star formation rate at around the epoch of re - ionization , an effect associated with both reionization and gas depletion .",
    "the radiation field is implemented in the same way in both runs and is independent of stellar feedback , so reionization is felt equally in both simulations",
    ". however , the decrease of the star formation activity at low redshifts is much more prominent in the feedback run , due to the extra effect of gas depletion of halos .",
    "we find and define the centers of halos using hop ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) on the dark matter .",
    "a halo is then defined as the spherical region around these centers which has an average dark matter density @xmath38 times the critical density @xmath39 ( bryan and norman 1998 ) .",
    "we require a minimum of 100 dark matter particles ( corresponding to a dark matter mass of @xmath40 ) in order to identify an overdense region as a dark matter halo .",
    "sub - halos ( objects identified as halos by our algorithm but which are included in larger virialized structures ) have been removed from the resulting set of halos .",
    "[ mbmt ] shows the variations of the baryonic content ( i.e. stars + gas ) of the simulated galaxies at redshift @xmath41 as well as their gas and stellar contents vs total mass , for both the feedback run ( left panel ) and the no - feedback run ( right panel ) .",
    "open circles represent halos with no stellar content while crosses represent halos with stellar content .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the ratio @xmath42 ( average ratio of baryon density over total matter density in the universe ) .    in the no - feedback run",
    ", the total baryon content is closely scattered around the @xmath42 line , as seen in previous @xmath43cdm simulations ( e.g. pearce et al .",
    "the deviation from the cosmic mean at low masses is due to the effect of photoionization on the baryon contents of dark matter halos and follows the shape also found by gnedin ( 2000 ) . on the contrary , in the feedback run ,",
    "even the largest halos at z=3 consistently contain only a small fraction of the baryons corresponding to @xmath42 , which is also suggested by the properties of observed dwarf galaxies in the local group ( e.g. mateo 1998 and references therein ) this significant difference between the results of the two runs indicates that low galaxy baryon contents can occur as a result of energy and momentum feedback from supernovae to the baryon gas : the latter is driven out of the potential well of the dark matter halos , leaving behind galaxies of lowered baryon content .",
    "we can draw additional support for this picture by comparing the two panels in the middle row of figure [ mbmt ] which displays the ratio of gas mass over total mass for the z=3 halos . in the left panel figure , which corresponds to the case with stellar feedback ,",
    "the scatter of halos towards low gas mass values is much larger than in the no - feedback case .",
    "this fact , considered in the framework of the scenario described above , is no surprise : in the no - feedback run the only mechanisms for gas depletion in a halo are the pressure from photo - ionization ( reionization ) , tidal stripping and the conversion of baryon gas to stars . in the simulation where feedback is taken into account , gas can be lost both to star formation and to the intergalactic medium because of galactic winds driven by supernovae .",
    "the additional gas depletion mechanism drives galaxies towards lower gas content values in the feedback run .    by comparing the two bottom panels of figure [ mbmt ] we can draw conclusions concerning the stellar population of halos in the feedback and no - feedback runs .",
    "a first obvious result is the existence of a large scatter in the total stellar content of galaxies both in the no - feedback and the feedback case .",
    "however , if we compare the galaxies with the largest stellar contents in both simulations , we find that the no - feedback run galaxies have much larger stellar contents , with the ratio of stellar mass over total mass reaching the @xmath42 value .",
    "this result is consistent with the much higher value of overall star formation rate in the no - feedback run when compared to that of the feedback run .",
    "thus stellar feedback is a factor that clearly hinders star formation through the depletion of baryonic gas and the increase of the temperature and pressure of the ism .",
    "it is also interesting to note that dark halos which do not host stars ( open circles in fig .",
    "[ mbmt ] ) all have relatively low masses .",
    "this can be understood within a hierarchical clustering scenario in terms of the inability of such small halos to hold photo - ionized gas .",
    "an additional effect of feedback is that by z=3 there already exists a population of halos with no stellar content whose baryon gas content is also extremely low ( as low as @xmath44 ) .",
    "the observational detection of such halos which are practically `` emptied '' from baryonic gas would be extremely difficult .",
    "this result could at least partially explain the deficit of low - mass satellite galaxies in observations in the local group as compared to the expectations from cdm cosmological simulations ( moore et al .",
    "1999 , klypin et al .",
    "the difference in mass to light ratios at small masses caused by reionization has also been investigated by somerville ( 2002 ) and benson et al .",
    "integration of the effect of stellar feedback to such simulations naturally drives a portion of the low - mass systems to baryon contents low enough to render them unobservable by means other than their dynamical effects .",

    "the deviation between the feedback and non - feedback behaviour is evident from @xmath46 and is most striking at @xmath41 .",
    "winds driven by the stellar feedback increase the temperature of the baryonic gas and drive the gas away from the galaxies in a rather asymmetrical fashion .    fig .",

    "the color scale is again logarithmic , and extends from @xmath47 to about @xmath48 k , and is the same for all snapshots .",
    "feedback is shown to result in the creation of non - spherical bubbles of hot gas , which , by redshift 3 , have a typical size of about 1 comoving mpc .",
    "the bubbles overlap , resulting in a global increase of the mean temperature of the gas in the cube , from @xmath49 k in the non - feedback case , to @xmath50 k in the feedback run , for z=3 .",
    "the wind - blown bubbles also do noticeably sweep up material in shells ahead of them .        the dwarf galaxy stellar content",
    "is affected by both feedback and photoionization . to demonstrate the relative importance of the two effects , we plot , in fig .",
    "[ dwarfpi ] , the fraction of halos with stellar content ( i.e. the number of halos which do host stars over the total number of halos in this mass range ) in three different mass ranges ( between @xmath52 and @xmath53 for panel a , between @xmath54 and @xmath55 for panel b and between @xmath56 and @xmath57 for panel c ) as a function of redshift .",
    "the results of the feedback run are represented by the dashed curves , while the results of the no - feedback run correspond to the solid curves .",
    "most low - mass halos ( panel a ) have not yet formed stars by @xmath58 but , as time progresses , the baryon density and jeans mass criteria of our star formation algorithm are satisfied in an increasing number of these halos and therefore the fraction of halos with stellar content initially increases .",
    "however , between redshifts 5 and 6 , when photoionization occurs , the process is reversed .",
    "the temperature ( and therefore the jeans mass ) increase , cooling rates and typical densities decrease , and star formation is inhibited .",
    "halos which accumulate enough mass to enter this mass range after reionization do not form stars , and the fraction of halos with stars decreases ( no - feedback run , solid curve ) . when feedback is added to this picture , it enhances the effect of reionization , by providing a second mechanism for increasing the temperature of the interstellar medium and decreasing the maximum densities reached in a given halo .",
    "the curve maximum occurs at a higher redshift and the fraction of halos with stars decreases even more at low z ( feedback run , dashed curve ) .    in halos of higher virial masses and temperatures , the central baryon densities",
    "are less affected by photo - ionization from reionization ( panels b and c ) . however , in the same mass ranges , feedback is effective in increasing the ism temperature and inhibiting star formation and is responsible for the small decrease in the number of higher - mass halos hosting stars at low redshifts , which is present only in the feedback run ( dashed curves ) .      in fig .",

    "however , before reionization , most sf activity comes from high - sfr halos and starburst - like events .",

    ", @xmath66 only differs from @xmath70 by an additive constant . in the same plot ,",
    "we have drawn a line of slope -1 , as in the observational result of prada & burkert ( 2002 ) , with a shifted intercept ( since we are plotting @xmath71 rather than mass - to - light ratios ) .",
    "although the scatter of the points is significant , one can observe the trend for the metallicity to decrease for increasing @xmath72 .",
    "a large @xmath69 implies a small stellar population relative to the total mass and consequently less integrated metal enrichment of the ism than systems with lower total mass to light ratios .",
    "in addition , small halos tend to blow out gas and metals and halt star formation before a high metallicity is reached within them .",
    "thus , these systems tend to have lower metal abundances than more massive systems .    when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] with observations , one should keep in mind that the local group satellites are much more evolved objects , while the evolution of our simulated halos stops at z=3 .",
    "however , it is encouraging that the simulations do show this trend and the hope is that in the future it will be possible to simulate a larger volume at similar mass and spatial resolution down to redshift zero .",
    "we have presented the first results of a large - scale three - dimensional cosmological hydrodynamic amr simulation of a cube of comoving size @xmath73 mpc living in a @xmath0cdm universe with cosmological parameters @xmath74 .",
    "star formation was allowed for , according to a parametric prescription creating collisionless particle out of baryonic fluid condensations exceeding the local jeans mass .",
    "we have compared the results of two runs , differing in the treatment of the stellar particles : in one case the latter did return energy , momentum and metal feedback to the interstellar medium , while in the other no stellar feedback was allowed for .",
    "the effects of reionization were studied by subjecting the baryon fluid to a homogeneous , haardt & madau radiation field of index -1.5 , independent of the cosmic star formation .",
    "over 300 galaxies are produced in our simulation over the mass range @xmath75 .",
    "the smallest dwarf galaxies in the local group show kinematic masses of @xmath76 ( mateo 1998 and references therein ) . however , these observed galaxies may be hosted in much more extended dark matter halos ( stoehr et al 2002 ) .",
    "it seems premature to argue for a significant modification of the cold dark matter scenarios such as to ask for significant annihilation rates ( cen 2001 ) to accommodate for their existence .",
    "the star formation histories of the smallest dwarf galaxies are also essential in understanding the recently proposed substructure problem raised by moore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and klypin et al .",
    "it has been argued that the systems associated with the extensive dark matter substructure found in n  body simulations of galaxy formation would not be in accord with the observations .",
    "this was one of the reasons for the proposal of spergel and steinhardt ( 2000 ) that the dark matter may be self  interacting which has attracted significant theoretical interest ( burkert 2000 ; kochanek and white 2000 ; yoshida et  al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "the connection between simulated dark matter substructure and observable quantities is a complex one and must depend dramatically on the intricacies of star formation and feedback in the small potential wells of interest ( bullock et al .",
    "2000 , somerville 2002 , benson et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "our results have shown that feedback from stars is a factor which can deplete halos of baryonic gas and significantly reduce their baryon mass fraction . the gas depletion due to feedback results in halos having a baryon - to - dark matter mass ratio which is consistently below the cosmic mean , @xmath77 , even in the very high mass objects .",
    "in addition , feedback can result to the formation of dark matter halos empty of stars by z=3 , and a baryon fraction so low that their observation would be particularly difficult .",
    "the existence of such a population of dark dwarf halos could at least partially explain the problem of missing satellites in the local group .",
    "we have found that feedback and reionization affect the star formation rate both globally and locally .",
    "the slope of the cosmic star formation history curve changes around the epoch of reionization with the effect being much more pronounced when feedback is present .",
    "in addition , most halos assembling after reionization do not form stars by @xmath41 , an effect which is again enhanced by the presence of feedback . furthermore , while before reionization most sf activity originates from high - sfr objects , after reionization there is a shift towards lower sfr halos as the source of most cosmic star formation .",
    "thus , to the extent that this effect is not an artifact of rapid gas depletion due to our high sf efficiency , a significant amount of the total star formation at intermediate redshifts ( 3 - 5 ) might be taking place in low - sfr halos .",
    "this effect has been first discussed by barkana and loeb ( 2000 ) and is here reported in full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .    finally , we find that the metallicity of galaxies is correlated with the mass - to - light ratio , increasing for decreasing metallicity .",
    "this trend is consistent with observational results of dwarf spheroidals in the local group .",
    "however , most of the objects in our simulation will merge to make larger galaxies and only a very small fraction will survive as isolated dwarf sized galaxies until today .",
    "so the presented comparison again only serves as an illustration and has as yet little predictive quality for the formation of dwarf galaxies",
    ". nevertheless , we find it very encouraging that these first results show that with yet larger simulations one will be able to make predictions and direct comparisons with properties of local dwarf galaxies ."
