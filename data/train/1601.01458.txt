    "after the phenomenon of extraordinary transmissions through subwavelength holes was investigated by surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) between metal and air in the optical region@xcite , it was found that the corrugated metal structure on the output surface could shape the transmitted light emerging from the aperture@xcite .",
    "the field on the exit surface has also been analyzed using the leaky surface - plasmon theory@xcite . in the microwave region , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) metal with drilling holes was proposed and investigated to support spoof spps@xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) corrugated metal structure has also shown to propagate spoof spps@xcite . similarly , electromagnetic beams shaped by the corrugated metal structure on the output surface@xcite have been observed , followed by the analysis of leaky - wave@xcite and the design of bull s eye antennas in the microwave frequency@xcite , as has been done in the optical frequency@xcite .",
    "however , in the microwave region the period of the corrugated metal structures is about one wavelength to support leaky waves , and the angle of radiation beam was determined by the empirical formula@xcite or complicated mode expansion method@xcite .    in recent years , subwavelength corrugations or grooves on metals supporting spoof spps with a period of approximately 1/6 wavelengths",
    "have been analyzed for slow - wave phenomena@xcite .",
    "however , the radiations of leaky waves by these subwavelength corrugations have not been discussed . as spoof spps on the 1d structure",
    "is also a kind of transverse magnetic ( tm ) surface wave@xcite , one could treat the subwavelength corrugations on metal as a kind of metasurface , the surface impedance of metasurface has been widely discussed and utilized to generate leaky waves , especially the sinusoidally modulated metasurfaces@xcite .",
    "conversely , the periodic structures satisfying the radiation condition could also be used to convert a propagating wave to surface wave@xcite due to the reversibility of light .    here",
    "we apply the concept of surface impedance to the subwavelength corrugated metal structure , which originally supports the spoof spps , and modulate the surface impedance using the cosine function and triangle - wave function , respectively , so that the modulated structures could radiate propagating waves as a periodic leaky - wave antenna .",
    "the antenna is fed at center of the structure through a slit , connecting to a feeding waveguide , as illustrated in figure [ fig : structure ] .",
    "the energy is coupled from the slit to the subwavelength corrugated structure on the output surface of the metal to propagate spoof spps and radiate a narrow broadside beam with high directivity .",

    "like spps in the optical frequency , spoof spps is a kind of tm surface wave@xcite .",
    "subwavelength corrugated metal structures have been proposed and investigated to support spoof spps , where the dispersion relation has also been widely discussed . by treating the subwavlength corrugated metal structure as a metasurface",
    ", we could calculate the surface impedance of different unit cells easily by analyzing the dispersion diagrams of spoof spps .",
    "then we could modulate the surface impedance of the corrugated structure periodically as a periodic leaky - wave antenna to radiate propagating waves from the spoof spps . here",
    "we choose two typical functions , the cosine function and the triangle - wave function , to modulate the surface impedance in order to observe the broadside radiation of leaky waves .",
    "the distribution of surface impedance corresponding to the subwavelength corrugated metal surface modulated with cosine function is written as @xmath8 , \\label{cosine}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the surface impedance along the @xmath10 direction that will be inductive for tm surface wave , @xmath11 is the average surface reactance , @xmath12 is the modulation depth , @xmath13 is the free - space wave number , @xmath14 represents the effective refractive index of surface wave , @xmath15 is the intrinsic impedance in free space , and @xmath16 is the polar angle of the radiation direction .",
    "the determination of the values for @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be discussed in the methods .    here , we set @xmath17 to observe a broadside radiation of leaky waves .",
    "the period of eq .",
    "is @xmath18 , which is consistent with the theory of leaky waves for the first spatial harmonic : @xmath19    for comparison , a triangle - wave function of surface impedance is also chosen , which is written in one period as : @xmath20 in which @xmath11 , @xmath12 and period @xmath18 are the same as those in eq . .    a detailed structure of the antenna",

    "the energy is fed from a connected waveguide , which is tunneled into the slit . on the output side of the slit ,",
    "the energy is coupled from the slit to the corrugated conductor which supports spoof spps or tm surface waves . since the surface impedance of the corrugated conductor is modulated periodically with periodic functions mentioned above , a broadside radiation of leaky waves could be observed .",
    "the minimum reflection coefficient s11 at the designed frequency @xmath23 is determined by the fabry - perot resonance of te@xmath24 mode in the slit , leading to the optimal length of the slit , @xmath3 mm , as shown in fig .",

    "the optimum process is described as follows .",
    "the dispersion relation of the te@xmath24 mode in the slit is given as @xmath25 , while the effective length @xmath26 of the fabry - perot resonance is a small modification of @xmath22 with @xmath27 , which has to satisfy @xmath28 in order to realize the tunneling effect .",
    "substituting @xmath28 into the dispersion relation , we have @xmath29 or @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the speed of light in vacuum . after that , for the designed frequency @xmath23 , we could calculate the effective resonant length @xmath26 as :    @xmath32    hence , if the designed frequency is 17 ghz , the effective resonant length @xmath26 is about @xmath33 mm , which is then set as the initial value for the optimum process .",
    "the length of slit is finally determined as @xmath3 mm , with a modification of @xmath34 mm .",
    "the simulated and measured reflection coefficients ( s11 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s11 ] .",
    "the red solid curve corresponds to the simulation result of the cosine distribution for the corrugated structure , and the blue dashed - doted curve refers to the simulation result of triangle - wave function distribution for the corrugated structure . for comparison ,",

    "the measured result of the corrugated structure with the cosine distribution is demonstrated as the black doted line . from fig .",
    "[ fig : s11 ] , we clearly observe that both distributions in the cosine function and triangle - wave function have a minimum reflection coefficient ( s11 ) under -10 db near the designed frequency 17 ghz .",
    "for the flat structure , the minimum s11 has a small shift to the low frequency but the reflection coefficient at 17 ghz is still under -10 db .",
    "the deviation is attributed to slightly different modification of @xmath35 as mentioned above . for the measured reflection coefficient of the cosine distribution",

    "conventionally , subwavelength corrugated metal structures have been studied for supporting spoof spps , but here we studied the radiation of leaky waves using this structure . by treating the subwavelength corrugated conductor as metasurface to support tm surface waves and calculating the surface impedance of different unit cells , we then modulated the surface impedance periodically as periodic leaky wave antennas to radiate leaky waves to the desired directions .",
