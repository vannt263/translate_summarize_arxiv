    "for over 15 years , the reactive empirical bond - order ( rebo ) potential of brenner _",
    "@xcite , or variations thereof , have been used for molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of detonation .",
    "it has been shown to follow the chapman - jouguet ( cj ) theory and even that of zeldovich , von neumann , and dring ( znd )  @xcite .",
    "being an md model , it has at least two major shortcomings , namely its spatial and temporal scales .",
    "as computers become more powerful and codes and algorithms become more advanced , some of the restrictions that limit these scales can be loosened , allowing for more realistic behavior to be modeled .    while providing an atomic scale model of a reactive material , the empirical and classical model of brenner _",
    "et al_.  falls short of including all aspects of an accurate representation .",
    "additionally , the spatial and temporal scales of real explosions make md simulations a large computational task .",
    "but md is still a useful tool for probing the characteristics of the detonation phenomenon , and the rebo potential is one of the best at balancing realism in the potential with accessibility to the large - scale ; yet there is room for improvement .",
    "md has certain conceptual advantages over hydrodynamics approaches that are parameterized to match the behavior of real high explosives .",
    "even though the latter models can mimic real experiments on the proper spatial and temporal scales , they make assumptions about the reaction rate and multiphase equation of state ( eos ) to do so . some of these assumptions are parameter fittings , which may not elucidate any new physical intuition about detonation of the high explosive ( he ) in question . in comparison ,",
    "md simulations depend on the parameterization of an interaction potential , which is arguably easier to connect directly to physical considerations than is a multiphase and multi - species eos .",
    "rebo has been used by many groups to model a variety of parameterizations and experimental configurations . however , a major criticism of this potential is that it has a thin reaction zone ( @xmath0   ) relative to typical real high explosives ( @xmath1  mm ) @xcite . in previous work",
    "@xcite several unconventional characteristics of the default parameterization of brenner _",
    "et al_.  @xcite ( called modeli as in @xcite ) are made evident :    * modeli displays nearly instantaneous dissociation upon compression by an unsupported detonation .",

    "its reaction zone is thin .",
    "* it readily allows for clustering . *",

    "it has clearly non - hyperbolic equilibrium hugoniots ( @xmath2 ) in @xmath3@xmath4 space .",
    "none of these characteristics are proven to be unrealistic .",
    "in fact for some primary high explosives , the plasma - like state seen in modeli at cj may be realistic @xcite .",
    "clustering , particularly of carbon , is a real phenomenon in the thermal decomposition of some he s @xcite .",
    "however , successful models of conventional explosives have either assumed or suggested that more molecular states @xcite with hyperbolic @xmath2s in @xmath3@xmath4 space @xcite are typical and that compressions at cj conditions should be @xmath5 ( for example petn @xcite ) rather than @xmath6 as with modeli @xcite .",
    "given that modeli can model a dissociated state , it would be useful to show that a more molecular state can also be modeled .",

    "for contrast in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv_rebo_jr ] , one can see that the rayleigh line for the unsupported simulation is significantly steeper than for that of the cj state .",
    "in znd theory this would require that the final state for modeliv is either at a strong point or a weak point .",

    "modeliv has a reversible reaction , the pathway of which includes an endothermic dissociation .",
    "endothermic steps can be responsible for weak point final states @xcite . perhaps , the repulsive core introduced in modeliv , by sheltering the dimers , prevents the reduction of the activation energy of the dissociative step and , hence , increases that step s reaction time , thus making it a stronger contributer to the overall reaction rate and causing the final state to be at a weak point . as is shown in the accompanying paper and can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : snpsht_jr_frnt ] , however , a 1d theory is not totally appropriate for this model .    in order to confirm",
    "that the modifications to the rebo model in the modeliv potential do , indeed , maintain a dimerized state , the radial distribution function ( rdf ) at the cj state is plotted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf_brewnjr ] the cj state of modeliv is compared to that of modeli . from the rdf for modeliv",
    ", one can see that , after the peak at @xmath9 , the curve drops to nearly zero while the analogous region in the rdf of modeli is closer to unity .",
    "this is indicative of a molecular state for modeliv and a dissociative state for modeli . from fig .",
    "[ fig : snpshts_cj ] , it is clear that the snapshot of the modeliv cj state supports the finding of the corresponding rdf .",

    "( see table  [ tab : jr ] ) .",
    "for modeli @xmath19 is the peak of the inner spline on the @xmath20 term and @xmath21 is the location of that peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdw_cmprsn ] ) . it can be shown that for modeli there exists no minimum above and within these cutoff values for all values of @xmath22 . to be considered part of a dimer",
    ", a particle must be bonded to only one other particle that is bonded to no other .",
    "if the particle types are the same , it is a product dimer ; if different , a reactant dimer . to be part of a cluster",

    "a particle must be bonded to no other .            with a bond defined , cookoffs that will reveal the reaction rate and the activation energy ( @xmath23 ) for each model",
    "can be simulated .",
    "this is done for two reasons , to compare modeliv to continuum models and to show another fortuitous difference between modeli and modeliv .",
    "the cookoffs are nve simulations started at different values of compression and internal energy but all with the initial ab chemical composition .",
    "as a simulation is started , thermal energy is partitioned among the different modes .",
    "after this has occurred and the reaction has progressed somewhat , the reaction rate is sampled over a short time and the temporal average of the rate and its standard error are recorded for the current simulation . in fig .  [",

    "when contrasting the two figures , one notices that , over a similar range of volumes , modeliv maintains a better fit to the arrhenius form than modeli and that the calculation of @xmath23 remains relatively constant when compared to the @xmath23 of modeli .",
    "a probable contribution to the former observation is the manner in which a reaction is defined . at compressions typical in detonations",
    ", modeli has a larger number of atoms in clusters and free states , which are not counted as reacted . only stable dimers are .",
    "one may consider a cluster of two a atoms tightly bonded together with a third , b - type particle loosely bonded to one of them as a state more reacted than one in which a is tightly bonded to b and loosely bonded to the other a. however , by our definition of reaction , all particles in a cluster are considered unreacted and only contribute to the denominator of the calculation of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath23 for modeli decreases with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "this is because at higher compressions an atom can have more neighbors within the bonding distance than with modeliv .",
    "the bond - order coefficient then lowers the attraction between it and its neighbors , making it easier to break apart any existing bonds . for modeliv ,",
    "the repulsive core keeps neighbors away from dimers so that the bond - order coefficient and , thus , the dissociation energy remain unaffected by the same level of compression that would otherwise cause modeli s dissociation energy to be reduced . for modeliv",
    "there is a higher tendency than for modeli for the compression to use up the space between dimers than that between the dimers constituents .",
    "this is because for the former case a third particle would have to climb the repulsive core that was added to the @xmath20 term before it got within the range of the cutoff function @xmath29 , where it can diminish the bond - order coefficient @xmath22 . in the latter case",
    "a third particle would only need to overcome the barrier of modeli s inner spline ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdw_cmprsn ] ) , which is small compared to the temperature for most situations considered in reaction and detonation . for modeliv",
    "the activation energy goes up slightly with decreasing volume .",
    "the exact reason for this is not known at present , but simulations with reaxff on the high explosive rdx also show this trend  @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 for modeliv is roughly 1  ev greater than for modeli .",
    "this is commensurate with the height of the repulsive core .",
    "even though we show that modeliv fits an arrhenius reaction rate in nve cookoff simulations , we would like to know that this is the type of reaction that takes place in the reaction zone .",
    "we can use that reaction rate along with the von neumann spike ( vns ) state to predict a @xmath25 profile . since we do not have the full eos throughout the reaction zone",
    ", we make some assumptions that will tend to shorten the width of the profile .",
    "let s assume that @xmath30 increases linearly and that @xmath4 and @xmath3 are constant such that @xmath31 .",

    "the theoretical @xmath25 profile reaches @xmath42 at @xmath43   , much closer to the front than the @xmath44    that we measure for the cj value of the particle velocity in fig .",
    "[ fig : vz_ovrlp_crit_jr ] .",
    "this does not prove that the reaction rate is arrhenius in the reaction zone , but it does show that the order of magnitude of the measured reaction zone width is significant compared to the lower bound of the theoretical width . had it been otherwise , this would have shown the reaction rate to not be arrhenius and thus a different form , for example , a flame front .    replacing the assumptions in the analysis with more accurate ones , for example , variable @xmath4 , would tend to lengthen the theoretical width because the expansion of the material would tend to cool it and slow the reaction rate . in lieu of the full eos , we could have used data from an nemd to fill in the state within the reaction zone . however , we would only be testing internal consistency .",
    "this comparison also suffers from an assumption of steady - state one - dimensionality .",
    "we have seen that the nemd simulations are 2d . as we show in the companion paper ,",
    "transverse waves traverse the reaction zone .",
    "this causes the profile to be time and @xmath45 dependent .",
    "the eos throughout the reaction zone is currently being calculated for normal mode stability analysis @xcite , which assumes an arrhenius reaction rate .",
    "in this paper it was shown that the changes to the modeli version of the rebo potential have reduced the amount of clustered and dissociated atoms at the cj state ( by rdf ) if not throughout the reaction zone ( by a snapshot of an nemd simulation ) .",
    "the cj state of modeliv is at a less compressed state and modeliv s reaction zone is wider than modeli s is .",
    "modeli s unsupported detonation velocity is much better predicted by cj theory , where modeliv s propagates significantly faster . in the companion paper we investigate modeliv s relative disparity more closely .",
    "the cookoff simulations reveal that modeliv fits an arrhenius reaction rate through a wider domain of compressions than does modeli and it has a higher and less density - dependent activation energy .",
    "it was put forth that this higher @xmath23 causes the final state to be at a weak point since it might make more significant in the reaction rate the endothermic step of dissociation . given , however , the 2d shape of the front in fig .",
    "[ fig : snpsht_jr_frnt ] , such a 1d explanation is probably insufficient .",
    "higher @xmath23s should increase the likelihood of 1 and 2d instabilities in detonation waves @xcite .",
    "the current value of @xmath46  ev is consistent with the presumed activation energies for many conventional he s .",
    "the goal of the current research is the improvement of rebo , which we believe we have achieved , mainly , by introducing increased atomic repulsion , which reduces the reaction cross section .",
    "it was shown that modeliv s reaction zone is wider than with modeli and that the cj state is a molecular one .",
    "rebo s insensitivity to initiation is increased , and a thicker induction zone is introduced .",
    "the reaction rate now behaves in a more arrhenius manner , and the product eos behaves more like a polytropic gas as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its equilibrium @xmath2 .",
    "some measurements , for example , the adiabatic @xmath47as is shown in the companion paper  and the amount of compression at cj , are more commensurate with conventional explosives  @xcite",
    ". however , some are not too close , for example , the reaction temperature and shock velocity .",
