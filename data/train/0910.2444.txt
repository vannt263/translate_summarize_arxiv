    "in order to apply the standard von neumann  dirac quantum formalism to a particular physical system such a particle , one must specify the precise form of the operators that represent measurements performed on the system  ( such as position and momentum measurements ) or that represent particular symmetry transformations  ( such as displacement or rotation ) of the frame of reference in which the system is being observed .",
    "these operators are usually determined by reference to a set of rules , the _ correspondence rules _ of quantum theory .",
    "however , the physical origin of many of these rules is obscure .",
    "accordingly , the physical meaning and the generality of even of the simplest of these rules is often unclear .",
    "for example , the conventional operator rules of quantum theory assert that , if measurements  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are represented by operators  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , respectively , then a measurement of  @xmath4 is represented by the operator  @xmath5  ( the _ operator sum rule _ ) . although this seems entirely reasonable on a formal , symbolic level , it is not clear in what _ physical _",
    "sense  @xmath5 can be said to ` represent ' the measurement . to see the difficultly ,",
    "consider that a classical measurement of  @xmath6 is typically implemented by an arrangement where measurements of  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 are performed immediately after one another , and their values added .",
    "when modeled in the quantum framework , the possible outputs of this arrangement , in the case where the measurements are performed on a spin-1/2 particle , are  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 .",
    "however , the operator  @xmath11 , which is supposed to represent a measurement of  @xmath6 , has only two possible outcomes  @xmath12 .",
    "perhaps more seriously , the conventional operator rules can lead to inconsistencies .",
    "for example , when the rule that the operator representing a measurement of  @xmath13 is given by  @xmath14 is applied to obtain the operator representing a measurement of  @xmath15 , one can obtain two operators ,  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 , which are not , in general , equivalent  . ] .",
    "similar difficulties exist with the canonical commutation relationships .",
    "for example , the relation  @xmath18=i\\hbar$ ] is typically justified by reference to the abstract arguments given by dirac  @xcite , or to arguments that depend on the symmetry group of flat spacetime  @xcite .",
    "the former arguments have been found to be logically problematic as well as being physically obscure  @xcite , and the latter arguments assume the operator rules and , furthermore , do not hold in curved spacetime , leaving it unclear whether the commutation relationships continue to hold there also .",
    "similarly , the commutation relation  @xmath19=i\\hbar { \\textsf{l}}_z$ ] is ordinarily derived in the infinite - dimensional quantum formalism for a particle  ( by transposing the classical relation  @xmath20 , and cyclic permutations thereof , into the quantum framework using the operator rules ) , and is then assumed , without further justification , to also hold for finite - dimensional systems with intrinsic angular momentum .",
    "the elucidation of the physical basis of the correspondence rules of quantum theory is important in order to ensure that the formalism is correctly applied in physical situations other than in which the quantum formalism was generated . for example , it is important to know whether the position  momentum commutation relations are valid in general spacetimes .",
    "however , the question of what physical ideas underpin the correspondence rules has received relatively little attention , with most recent work on the elucidation of the physical origin of the quantum formalism  ( see  @xcite for references ) tending to focus exclusively on the the abstract quantum framework , or being concerned with the derivation of the schroedinger or dirac equation directly  @xcite .    in this paper , we show that all of the commonly - used correspondence rules of quantum theory can be obtained systematically from a physical principle which we call the _ average - value correspondence principle _  ( avcp ) , first briefly introduced in  @xcite . in particular , we show that it is possible to derive all of the following types of rules :    * _ operator rules . _ rules for writing down operators representing measurements of observables that , in the framework of classical physics , are known functions of other , elementary , observables whose operators are given  , then  @xmath21 ; ( ii )  rule  2  ( sum rule ) :  if  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 , then  @xmath24  ( and similarly for more than two observables ) , and ( iii )  rule  3  ( product rule ) :  if  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 , where  @xmath25=0 $ ] , then  @xmath26  ( and similarly for more than two observables ) .",
    "a more general rule that is often employed is :  ( iv )  rule  3@xmath27  ( hermitization rule ) :  if  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 , then  @xmath28 . ] .",
    "for example , such rules are needed to be able to write down the operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath29 , given the classical relation  @xmath30 , in terms of the operators  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 which represent measurements of  @xmath33 and  @xmath34 , respectively . * _ measurement commutation relations .",
    "_ commutation relations between operators that represent measurements of fundamental observables such as position , momentum , and components of angular momentum .",
    "the commutation relations  @xmath18=i\\hbar$ ] and  @xmath35=i\\hbar{\\textsf{l}}_z$ ] , are the obvious examples , while dirac s poisson bracket rule ,  @xmath25 = i\\hbar \\widehat{\\{a , b\\}}$ ] , is the more general rule , where  @xmath36 is the classical poisson bracket for observables  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 , and  @xmath37 , @xmath2 , and  @xmath3 are the respective operators . * _ measurement  transformation commutation relations .",
    "_ the commutation relations between measurement operators and transformation operators .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath33-displacement operator ,  @xmath38 , one has , for example ,  @xmath39=i$ ] and  @xmath40=0 $ ] . * _ transformation operators . _",
    "explicit forms of the operators that represent symmetry transformations of a frame of reference , such as the @xmath33-displacement operator  @xmath41 .",
    "the average - value correspondence principle is based on the simple idea that the classical and quantum models of any physical system must agree on average .",
    "to illustrate the key idea behind the principle , consider the classical and quantum models of a particle .",
    "suppose that , in the classical model of a particle , a measurement of the position ,  @xmath42 , of a particle of mass  @xmath43 , is made at time  @xmath44 .",
    "this measurement can be implemented by performing measurements of its position ,  @xmath33 , and its momentum ,  @xmath34 , at time  @xmath45 , and then computing  @xmath46 .",
    "now consider the quantum model of the particle .",
    "consider three distinct experiments on the particle .",
    "in the first , a measurement of position ,  @xmath33 , is performed at time  @xmath45 ; in the second , a measurement of momentum,@xmath34 , is performed at time  @xmath45 ; in the third , a measurement of position ,  @xmath42 , is performed at time  @xmath45 .",
    "the avcp asserts that , over many runs of these three quantum experiments , the _ average _ values , which we shall respectively denote  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 , satisfy the relation  @xmath49 .",
    "that is , _ on average _ , the classical relation  @xmath46 is satisfied .",
    "this remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : avcp ] by describing the  avcp . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deduction ] , the avcp is used to obtain several _ generalized operator rules _ which connect the average values of operators at different times , from which the commonly used operator rules of quantum theory follow as a special case .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : commutation - relations ] , we use the avcp to derive many of the commonly employed correspondence rules of quantum theory , namely  ( a ) the commutation relations  @xmath18=i\\hbar$ ] and  @xmath19=i\\hbar{\\textsf{l}}_z$ ] , and dirac s poisson bracket rule , ( b )  the explicit form of the operators for displacements and rotations , and ( c )  the commutation relations between momentum and displacement operators , and between angular momentum and rotation operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : induction ] , we describe a line of argument which naturally leads to the avcp , and which suggests how it may be generalized .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the results obtained .",
    "we note that the treatment of the correspondence rules is illustrative rather than exhaustive , so that only the most commonly encountered measurement and transformation operators which are needed to formulate non - relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics have been discussed .",
    "many other correspondence rules  ( such as the operators that represent galilei transformations , temporal displacement , and discrete transformations such as spatial inversion ) can be obtained by arguments which closely follow those presented .",
    "suppose that , in a classical experiment , a measurement of observable  @xmath0 on a physical system can be implemented by an arrangement where measurements of observables  @xmath50 are performed on the system  ( possibly performed at a different time to the measurement of  @xmath0 ) , such that the value obtained from measurement of  @xmath0 can be calculated as a function ,  @xmath51 , of the values obtained from the measurements of  @xmath50 .",
    "the avcp asserts that we can then construct a corresponding quantum experiment , where quantum measurements  @xmath52 , corresponding to classical measurements of  @xmath53 , are performed on copies of the same physical system , and asserts that the same functional relation holds _ on average _ between the values obtained from the quantum measurements , where the average is taken over infinitely many trials of the quantum experiment .",
    "this connection holds only if  @xmath51 satisfies a particular condition .",
    "the particular form of the quantum experiment is stipulated by the avcp , and consists in specifying whether , for each pair of quantum measurements , the measurements in the pair are performed on the same or different copies of the system .    the precise form of the corresponding quantum experiment is arrived at by carefully considering a sequence of particular examples , for which the reader is referred to sec .  [ sec : induction ] . through such considerations ,",
    "one finds that the key difficulty is what the quantum experiment must be in the case where the operators involved are non - commuting .",
    "for example , suppose that , in the classical framework , a measurement of  @xmath54 at time  @xmath45 can be implemented by performing measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 at time  @xmath45 .",
    "suppose further that , in the quantum framework , it is known that operators  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 represent measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 respectively , and that  @xmath25\\neq 0 $ ] . in this case",
    ", the avcp requires that the quantum measurements are performed on separate copies of the system . on the other hand , if the operators commute , and if the quantum measurements are not performed on sub - systems of a composite system , then the measurements are required to be performed on the same copy of the system .",
    "the intuition here is simple :  when the operators commute , this is an essentially classical situation , and the measurements can be performed on the same copy of the system ; when , however , the operators do not commute , this is a distinctively non - classical situation , in which case , to avoid the complication of one measurement s results being affected by that of the other , and to avoid the issue of measurement ordering , the measurements are performed on separate copies of the system .      consider a classical idealized experiment in which a system  ( possibly a composite system ) is prepared in some state at time  @xmath55 , and is allowed to evolve in a given background .",
    "suppose that a measurement of  @xmath56  @xmath57 , performed on the system at time  @xmath58 with value  @xmath59 , can be implemented by an arrangement where measurements of  @xmath60 are performed upon one copy of the system at time  @xmath61 , and the values of their respective results , denoted  @xmath62 , are then used to compute the output  @xmath63 , where  @xmath51 is an analytic function , so that the relation @xmath64 holds for all initial ( classical )  states of the system  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : avcp - example ] ) .    consider the case where the quantum measurements  @xmath65 , with operators  @xmath66 , represent the measurements of  @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "then , consider the following idealized quantum experimental arrangement consisting of several set - ups , each consisting of identical sources and backgrounds , where , in each set - up , a copy of the system is prepared in the same initial state ,  @xmath68 , at time  @xmath55 .    in one set - up",
    ", only measurement  @xmath69 is performed  ( at time  @xmath58 ) and , for any  @xmath70 with  @xmath71 and  @xmath72 , the measurements  @xmath73 are performed  ( at time  @xmath61 ) in :    1 .   the _ same _ set - up if  @xmath74=0 $ ] , and 2 .",

    "let the values of the results of the measurements  @xmath75 in any given run of the experimental arrangement be denoted  @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the function  @xmath63 is defined as _ simple _ provided that its polynomial expansion contains no terms involving a product of eigenvalues belonging to measurements whose operators do not commute . if  @xmath51 is simple , then   holds on average , the average being taken over an infinitely large number of runs of the experiment .",
    "an example of the application of the avcp .",
    "( i ) a classical experiment showing the measurements of  @xmath77 and  @xmath54 performed at times  @xmath78 , and  @xmath79 , respectively , with values denoted as  @xmath80 , and  @xmath81 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath82 and  @xmath83 .",
    "suppose that one finds that the relation  @xmath84 holds for all initial states of the system .",
    "( ii ) the corresponding quantum experiment .",
    "three copies of the system are prepared in the same initial state ,  @xmath68 , at time  @xmath55 , and are placed in identical backgrounds . in this example , it is assumed that the operators  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 do not commute .",
    "hence , by the avcp , measurements  @xmath85 and  @xmath86 are performed on different copies of the system .",
    "measurement  @xmath87 is performed on a separate copy of the system . in any given run of the experiment , the probabilities that measurements  @xmath85 , @xmath86 and  @xmath87 yield values  @xmath88 and  @xmath89  ( @xmath90 ) , are  @xmath91 and  @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the avcp then asserts that , provided the polynomial expansion of  @xmath93 contains no product terms involving  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 , the relation  @xmath96 holds for all initial states ,  @xmath68 , of the system , where the average is taken over an infinite number of runs of the experiment ; that is , @xmath97 for all  @xmath68.,width=312 ]",
    "we will now apply the avcp to derive operator relations which hold when the function  @xmath51 takes various useful forms . in each instance of  @xmath51",
    ", we shall first derive a generalized operator rule which relates the expected values of the relevant operators at _",
    "different times_. then , taking the special case when the expected values are computed at the same time , we obtain the corresponding operator rule which relates the operators themselves .",
    "we shall consider a classical experiment where a system is subject to measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 at time  @xmath61 , and to a measurement of  @xmath54 at time  @xmath58 .",
    "we shall suppose that a measurement of  @xmath54 , with value  @xmath81 , can be implemented by an arrangement in which the measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are performed , with respective values  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 , and the function  @xmath93 then computed , so that the relation @xmath98 holds for all initial states of the system .    in the quantum counterpart of the appropriate experimental arrangement ,",
    "let the operators that represent the corresponding quantum measurements be denoted  @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 , and  @xmath99 , respectively . to simplify the presentation",

    "for example , one can first apply this rule to find that the operator representing a measurement of  @xmath13 is @xmath142 where the notation  @xmath143 is used to denote the operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath144 .",

    "hence , the avcp can not be applied to non - simple functions of observables , even in weakened form , without leading to inconsistencies .",
    "we also remark that , given the avcp , it can not consistently be maintained that every classical measurement is represented by a quantum measurement . to see this ,",

    "although a particular system has been used to obtain this commutation relation , we shall later present an argument for its general validity .",
    "suppose that , in frame  @xmath182 , the system is in state  @xmath183 .",

    "fig : mments - of - a - squared ] ) : ( i )  make a measurement of  @xmath0 on one copy of the system , and square the value obtained ; ( ii )  make two immediately successive measurements of  @xmath0 on one copy of the system , and multiply the two values obtained ; or  ( iii )  make two simultaneous measurements of  @xmath0 on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and multiply the two values obtained .",
    "all three arrangements yield the same output , and so can be regarded as equally valid implementations of a measurement of  @xmath367 .",
    "three arrangement that implement a measurement of  @xmath367 . in  ( i )",
    ", a measurement of  @xmath0 is made on one copy of the system , and the value obtained is squared to give the output ; in ( ii ) , two immediately successive measurements of  @xmath0 are made on one copy of the system , and the output is obtained by multiplying the two values obtained ; and ( iii )  two simultaneous measurements of  @xmath0 are made on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and the output is obtained by multiplying the two values obtained . in a classical model of these arrangements , each arrangement yields the same output . however , in the quantum counterparts of these arrangements , the expected output of  ( i ) and  ( ii ) is  @xmath368 whereas the expected output of  ( iii ) is  @xmath369.,width=312 ]    let us now consider the quantum counterparts of these arrangements where a quantum measurement  @xmath108 takes the place of all instances of a measurement of  @xmath0 . in the first such quantum arrangement , one copy of the system is prepared in some state and measurement  @xmath108 performed on this system , yielding result  @xmath105  ( @xmath370 ) , with associated value  @xmath371 , with probability  @xmath111 .",
    "the output of the arrangement is thus  @xmath372 with probability  @xmath111 , so that @xmath373 similarly , one finds that arrangement  ( ii ) yields the same expected output .",
    "however , in arrangement  ( iii ) , where , in each run of the experiment , two copies of the system are prepared in the same state , one obtains @xmath374 with  @xmath111 and  @xmath112 denoting , respectively , the probabilities that measurements  @xmath108 on the first and second copy yield result  @xmath105 and  @xmath106  ( @xmath375 ) .    therefore ,",
    "although the three arrangements are equivalent in the classical framework , their quantum counterparts are _ not _ , in general , equivalent in the quantum framework .",
    "this difference arises due to the fact that , in the quantum framework , an immediate repetition of a measurement on the same copy of a system is different from performing a second simultaneous measurement on a separate , identically - prepared copy of the system .",
    "the existence of different arrangements that implement the same classical measurement immediately raises two questions .",
    "first , are the quantum counterparts of these arrangements , in some sense , equally valid in the quantum framework , or it is possible to find some reasonable physical basis upon which to select particular arrangements and regard these as more fundamental than the others ?",
    "second , is it possible to find operators that represent the selected arrangements , and , if so , are all of these represented by the same operator ?    to answer these questions , we begin by observing that , although the above arrangements are all regarded as _ bone fide _ implementations of measurements in the classical model , a measurement is only describable as such in the quantum framework , and so can be called a quantum measurement , if it can be represented by a hermitian operator which represents a single measurement performed upon one copy of the system at a particular time .",
    "so , for example , although the quantum counterpart of arrangement  ( iii ) can be _ modeled _ in the quantum framework , it _ can not _ be described as a quantum measurement since it involves two separate measurements .",
    "in contrast , the quantum counterpart of arrangement  ( i ) _ can _ be described as a quantum measurement since it only involves a single measurement on one copy of the system .",
    "however , even though an arrangement involving more than one measurement can not itself be regarded as a quantum measurement , we can reasonably ask whether it is possible to find a quantum measurement ,  @xmath110 , with operator  @xmath99 , which , in some sense to be determined , can nonetheless be said to _ represent _ such an arrangement .    at the outset",
    ", we note that it makes no sense to require that measurement  @xmath110 always yield a value that coincides with the output of a given arrangement since measurement results are only probabilistically determined in the quantum framework .",
    "however , we _ can _ impose the simple condition that , over an infinite number of runs , the average value obtained from measurement  @xmath110 should coincide with the average output obtained from the arrangement for any initial state of the system .",
    "for example , in the case of an arrangement that implements a measurement of  @xmath367 , quantum measurement  @xmath87 which , by hypothesis , represents the arrangement , must be such that , for all states of the system ,  @xmath376 is equal to the expected output obtained from the arrangement . in the case of arrangements  ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) described above , using eq .",
    ", we accordingly obtain the condition that the relation @xmath377 must hold for all states ,  @xmath171 , of the system . from this condition",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath378 in the case of arrangement  ( iii ) , using eq .",
    ", we obtain the condition that the relation @xmath379 must hold for all  @xmath171 . by diagonalizing  @xmath2",
    ", one can readily show that this condition implies that  @xmath2 is a multiple of the identity , which represents a trivial measurement that yields the same result irrespective of the state of the system .",
    "therefore , arrangement  ( iii ) does not satisfy the above average - value condition in the case of any non - trivial measurement of  @xmath0 , and can therefore be reasonably eliminated .",
    "hence , in this case , the average - value condition is sufficiently strong so as to be able to pick out arrangements  ( i ) and  ( ii ) .",
    "furthermore , since the average - value condition also implies that these arrangements are both represented by the operator ,  @xmath380 , one can unambiguously conclude that a measurement of  @xmath367 is represented by the operator  @xmath380 .",
    "we can proceed in a similar way for a measurement of  @xmath381 , where measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are assumed to occur at the same time . in this case",
    ", one needs to take into account the additional fact that , in the quantum framework , the order in which two measurements is performed is of possible importance .",
    "accordingly , one can imagine implementing a measurement of  @xmath4 using one of at least three arrangements  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mments - of - a - plus - b ] ) : ( i )  make a measurement of  @xmath0 , and then a measurement of  @xmath1 , on one copy of the system , and add the values obtained ; ( ii ) make a measurement of  @xmath1 , and then a measurement of  @xmath0 , on one copy of the system , and add the values obtained ; ( iii )  make a measurement of  @xmath0 on one copy of the system and , simultaneously , a measurement of  @xmath1 on a second copy of the system prepared in the same state as the first copy , and add the values obtained . once again , in the classical framework , the outputs of these arrangements agree .",
    "however , in the quantum counterparts of these arrangements , one finds that , if  @xmath25\\ne 0 $ ] , the expected outputs of all three arrangements will , in general , disagree with one another .",
    "three implementations of a measurement of  @xmath4 . in  ( i ) , a measurement of  @xmath0 , and then a measurement of  @xmath1 , is made on one copy of the system , and the values obtained are then added to give the output ; in ( ii ) , a measurement of  @xmath1 , and then a measurement of  @xmath0 , is made on one copy of the system , and the values obtained are then added to give the output ; and ( iii )  simultaneous measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are made on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and the output is obtained by adding the two values obtained . in a classical model of these arrangements ,",
    "each arrangement yields the same output .",
    "however , the quantum counterparts of these arrangements do not , in general , have the same expected outputs.,width=312 ]    restricting ourselves for the time being to measurements  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 that are not subsystem measurements  , one finds that , in the case of a measurement of  @xmath382 , only arrangement  ( iii ) is possible if  @xmath25\\ne 0 $ ] , which then yields the operator @xmath383 if  @xmath25= 0 $ ] , then all three arrangements are possible , and all yield the same operator ,  @xmath99 , as above .    finally , in the case of a measurement of  @xmath13 , with  @xmath25=0 $ ] , one finds that the only possible arrangement is the one where measurements  @xmath85 and  @xmath86 are performed on the same copy of the system , in which case the operator  @xmath384 is obtained .",
    "hence , we see that the average - value condition is sufficient to yield a unique operator representation for the measurements considered above . based on the above considerations , we can tentatively formulate the following general rule :  _ in the case of a measurement which is implemented by an arrangement that contains two measurements  ( not subsystem measurements ) that , in its quantum counterpart , are represented by quantum measurements with commuting operators , it is possible to find a quantum measurement that represents the arrangement if the two measurements are performed on the same copy of the system ; but , when the operators do not commute , the measurements must be performed on different copies of the system . _",
    "we now consider implementations of a measurement of  @xmath13 in the case when  @xmath25\\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "the general rule just given suggests that we should consider the arrangement where the measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 are performed on different copies of the system .",
    "the quantum counterpart of this arrangement has the expected output @xmath385 with  @xmath111 and  @xmath112 denoting respectively the probabilities that the measurement  @xmath108 on the first copy and the measurement  @xmath109 on the second copy yield result  @xmath105 and  @xmath106  ( @xmath375 ) , and  @xmath88 respectively denoting the values of the @xmath105th and @xmath106th results of measurements  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 . imposing the above average - value condition ,",
    "the operator  @xmath99 that represents this implementation must satisfy the condition @xmath386 for all  @xmath171 .",
    "however , for non - commuting  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , one finds that  @xmath99 can not be found such that this relation is satisfied for all  @xmath171 .",
    "we note , however , that with @xmath387 equation   holds for the eigenstates of  @xmath2 and the eigenstates of  @xmath3 , which suggests the possibility of weakening the average - value condition in this case so that we only require that eq",
    ".   holds for these eigenstates .",
    "however , as we shall illustrate later  ( sec .",
    "[ sec : inconsistencies ] ) , the application of eq .   can lead to inconsistencies .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , from the point of view of the average - value condition , it is not possible to find an operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath13 when the operators  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 do not commute .",
    "more generally , we find that , when  @xmath25\\ne 0 $ ] , it is necessary to exclude measurements of  @xmath158 , with  @xmath51 analytic  ( so that  @xmath51 has a well - defined polynomial expansion in  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 ) , where the polynomial expansion of  @xmath51 contains product terms .    finally , in the case of a classical measurement which is implemented by an arrangement which contains two measurements that are performed on different subsystems of a composite system , one finds that the quantum counterpart of this arrangement can be represented by a quantum measurement irrespective of whether the two measurements are performed on the same or on different copies of the system , and that the different possible arrangements are represented by the same operator .      in the examples above ,",
    "we have considered arrangements that implement a classical measurement in which the measurement and the measurements in the arrangement are performed at the same time and in the same frame of reference . however , as the following examples illustrate , these are unnecessary restrictions .",
    "first , classically , for a non - relativistic particle of mass  @xmath43 , one can implement a measurement of  @xmath33 performed at time  @xmath44 by an arrangement where measurements of  @xmath33 and  @xmath34 are performed at time  @xmath45 , and the function  @xmath388 is then computed .",
    "second , one can implement a measurement of  @xmath42 on a particle in the reference frame  @xmath184 that is displaced along the @xmath33-axis relative to frame  @xmath182 by performing a measurement of  @xmath33 in frame  @xmath182 , and computing the appropriate function  @xmath389 that relates  @xmath33 and  @xmath42 .",
    "the above considerations regarding the implementation of a classical measurement are applicable without change to the case where the measurement and the measurements in the arrangement by which it is implemented are performed at different times or in different frames of reference .",
    "the statement of the avpc accordingly generalizes our notion of the implementation of a classical measurement .",
    "the avcp could also be generalized in other ways , for example to the case where the measurements of  @xmath390 are not performed at the same time",
    ". however , these generalizations are unnecessary for the derivations of the usual correspondence rules of quantum theory , and are therefore not discussed here .",
    "the derivation given in this paper provides several interesting insights into measurements and their representation .",
    "the first insight is that a measurement of a classical observable  ( such as a measurement of  @xmath391 ) can be implemented by more than one arrangement , and that the quantum counterparts of these arrangements are not , in general , equivalent .",
    "second , it is possible to impose a simple average - value condition that must be satisfied by an operator that can be said to represent a quantum arrangement .",
    "this condition implies that many arrangements can not be represented by an operator , and can therefore be eliminated from consideration .",
    "that is , one finds that there are arrangements which , although acceptable representations of a measurement in the classical framework , have quantum counterparts that can not be represented by operators in the quantum framework without violating a very mild average - value condition .",
    "third , in the case of a quantum arrangement that satisfies the average - value condition , the operator that represents the arrangement is uniquely determined by the average - value condition provided that the function ,  @xmath51 , that describes the arrangement , is simple .",
    "one also finds that those arrangements that satisfy the average - value condition are represented by the same operator , so that it is possible to represent a measurement of  @xmath51 by a unique operator .",
    "if  @xmath51 is not simple , then it does not appear to be possible to apply the average - value condition , even in a weakened form , without inconsistencies arising .",
    "fourth , we have found that the avcp is incompatible with the assumption that every classical measurement on a system is represented by a quantum measurement in the quantum model of the system . for example , the avcp implies that a measurement of  @xmath13 does not have an operator representation if  @xmath392 } } \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "we leave it as an open question as to whether ways can be found for systematically dealing with the inconsistencies  ( as illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : deduction ] ) to which rules such as the hermitization rule  ( which is obtainable by weakening avcp as indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec : av - condition ] ) tend to lead .",
    "the fifth insight rests on the fact that , rather surprisingly , the avcp enables correspondence rules of many different types  operator rules , measurement commutation relations , measurement  transformation commutation relations , and the forms of the transformation operators  to be obtained in a uniform manner .",
    "consequently , one can see that the difference between these types of rules depends simply upon whether the classical relations that one is taking over into the quantum framework are relations between measurements performed at the same time  ( leading to the operator rules ) , at different times  ( leading to measurement commutation relations ) , or in different frames of reference  ( leading to measurement  transformation commutation relations and to the explicit forms of transformation operators ) . in short , from the perspective provided by the derivation , the commutation relation  @xmath159 = i\\hbar$ ] is no more mysterious in its origin than the operator relation  @xmath393 .",
    "sixth , the derivation provides a clearer physical foundation to many particular correspondence rules that are commonly used in quantum theory .",
    "for example , the commutation relation  @xmath19=i\\hbar { \\textsf{l}}_z$ ] is here obtained directly for finite- and infinite - dimensional quantum systems , and in a manner that makes clear its connection with the properties of rotations .",
    "similarly , a restricted form of dirac s poisson bracket rule has been derived in a systematic manner using the avcp without making use of abstract analogies .",
    "more generally , the derivation provided here shows that average - value correspondence is rather useful . in particular",
    "it allows familiar relations known to hold in classical physics  ( the less precise theory ) to be systematically transformed into exact relations amongst operators  ( such as commutation relations ) in quantum theory  ( the more precise theory ) , which is something that one might intuitively not expect would be possible .",
    "moreover , insofar as its use as a methodological tool in building up new physical theories is concerned , the only formal aspect of quantum theory of which the avcp makes use is the idea of the commutativity or otherwise of two measurement operators , which however can be replaced by a simple operational criterion within the probabilistic operational framework described in  @xcite .",
    "hence , the avcp itself can be regarded as standing quite independently of the quantum formalism , and can be used as a constructive tool in building up new theories within a general operational probabilistic framework .",
    "finally , we remark that , although the general notion of average - value correspondence is already familiar in elementary quantum mechanics through ehrenfest s theorem , the possibility that such a correspondence might serve as the basis for a constructive principle that allows the correspondence rules of quantum theory to be determined by appropriately - chosen classical relations does not appear to have been widely explored  .",
    "it has been shown here that it is possible to formulate the notion of average - value correspondence in the form of an exact physical principle which , roughly speaking , allows the logic of ehrenfest s argument to be reversed .",
