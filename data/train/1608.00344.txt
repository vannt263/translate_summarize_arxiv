    "the determination of the maximum mass of a neutron star ( ns ) ( rotating and nonrotating ) is one of the long - standing , important subjects in astrophysics ( for a comprehensive introduction dedicated to this problem see ref .",
    "( @xcite ) ) . in particular , the identification of a black hole requires the knowledge of the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "the maximum neutron star mass has a considerable interest for the study of the production of neutron stars and black holes in the dynamics of supernovae explosion .",
    "moreover , the experimental observations of neutron star masses have imposed strong constraints on the hadronic eos of superdense matter ( see also the references about the neutron star mass distribution  @xcite ) .",
    "the most famous examples are the recent discoveries of massive neutron stars with gravitational masses of @xmath1 ( prs j1614 - 2230 @xcite ) and @xmath2 ( psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite ) .    from theoretical point of view",
    ", it is well known that the exact value of the maximum mass @xmath3 of a ns depends strongly on the eos of @xmath4-stable nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the eos of compressed matter is rather good understood from studies of intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , in such reactions the compressed hadronic fireball does not exceed densities two or three times the saturation density . at higher densities the astrophysical observations on compact neutron stars are crucial for a better understanding of superdense hadronic matter , which is suppossed to exist in the core of these cosmic objects . despite intensive investigations ,",
    "the upper bound of neutron stars remains up to present uncertain  @xcite .",
    "one possibility to proceed with an estimate of @xmath3 is based on the pioneering idea of rhoades and ruffini  @xcite , where an optimum upper bound of mass of non - rotating neutron stars has been derived using a variational technique . in particular , they considered the most extreme eos which produces the maximum mass solely compatible with the following three conditions : ( a ) standard general - relativity equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , ( b ) le chattelier s principle , and ( c ) the principle of causality @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding an optimum bound on the mass of non - rotating neutron stars was considered also by other authors ( see  @xcite and references therein ) adopting similar assumptions to those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so far , the theoretical assumptions for the construction of a neutron star eos have been focused on the approximate treatment of strongly interacting many - body systems .",
    "an issue has been raised recently concerning the high - density upper bound of the speed of sound .",
    "due to causality the speed of sound @xmath5 must not exceed that of light",
    ". however , causality arguments are not enough to allow a determination of the upper bound of the speed of sound , as pointed out by hartle @xcite .",
    "indeed , weinberg  @xcite showed that the speed of sound is much less than the speed of light for a cold nonrelativistic fluid .",
    "it increases with temperature , but it does not exceed the value @xmath6 in the limit of very high temperatures . the mentioned result seems to be unaffected when electromagnetic forces are considered  @xcite .",
    "however , this is still under debate .",
    "lattimer  @xcite provided theoretical arguments that the causal limit is too extreme since the highly compressed hadronic matter may convert asymptotically to free quark matter where the speed of sound is @xmath7 .",
    "recently , bedaque and steiner @xcite have found simple arguments that support the limit @xmath6 in non - relativistic and/or weakly coupled theories .",
    "this has been demonstrated in several classes of strongly coupled theories with gravity duals .",
    "the upper limit saturated only in conformal theories .",
    "the authors pointed out that the existence of neutron stars with masses about two solar masses combined with the knowledge of the eos of hadronic matter at low densities is not consistent with the mentioned bound . finally , it is worthy to mention that in a previous analysis olson  @xcite employed a phenomenological approach in the context of the kinetic theory , in order to determine an upper limit for the maximum mass of ns . in this approach",
    "the upper bound of the speed of sound appears to be less than the speed of light .    in view of the above investigations we believe that additional theoretical study is required . in this study ,",
    "the effects of the upper bound of the speed of sound on the maximum mass of stars should be included in comparison with the recent astronomical observations .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper is to study in detail the limiting cases of the upper bound of the speed of sound and their effects on the bulk neutron star properties .",
    "we calculate maximum neutron star masses in relation to various scenarios for the upper bound of the speed of sound .",
    "we use a class of equation of states , which have been extensively employed in the literature and mainly have the advantage to predict neutron star masses close or higher to the experimentally observed value of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider two upper bounds for the speed of sound . that is :",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , a phenomenological approach based on the kinetic theory is considered .",
    "this approach offers an additional independent theoretical prescription for the upper limit of the speed of sound in matter in relation to the maximum value of neutron star masses .    we also extend our study to the analysis of the tidal polarizability ( deformability ) , which can be estimated experimentally .",
    "the theoretical results for the tidal polarizability are discussed and analyzed in comparison with the corresponding observations of the advanced ligo and the einstein telescope .",
    "we conclude , that the accurate measurement of the tidal polarizabiliy @xmath10 for a high mass neutron stars can be used to better understand the high - density stiffness of the eos and the limit issue of the speed of sound in compressed matter .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec  ii we briefly review the model for the maximum mass configuration . in section",
    "iii we present the hadronic models for nuclear equation of state used in the present study .",
    "in section iv we analyze the tidal polarizability .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .   v. the main conclusions of the present study ,",
    "are presented in sec  v.",
    "it is known that no bounds can be determined for the mass of non - rotating neutron stars without some assumptions concerning the properties of neutron star matter @xcite . in this study , following the work of sabbadini and hartle @xcite we consider the following four assumptions : ( i ) the matter of the neutron star is a perfect fluid described by a one - parameter equation of state between the pressure @xmath11 and the energy density @xmath12 , ( ii ) the energy density @xmath12 is non negative ( due to attractive character of gravitational forces ) , ( iii ) the matter is microscopically stable , which is ensured by the conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 and ( iv ) below a critical baryon density @xmath15 the equation of state is well known .    from the above assumptions and the solution of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations",
    "it follows that the density and pressure decreases outward in the star .",
    "furthermore , we introduce two regions for specifying more precisely the eos .",
    "the radius @xmath16 at which the pressure is @xmath17 , divides the neutron star into two regions .",
    "the core , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the envelope where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the pressure @xmath11 , the energy density @xmath12 the density @xmath22 and the baryon density @xmath23 in nuclear mater are given as follow : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy per baryon and @xmath26 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the adiabatic speed of sound is defined as  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the entropy per baryon . in the present work we consider the following three upper bounds for the speed of sound    1 .",
    "@xmath29 : causality limit from special relativity ( see @xcite and reference therein ) 2 .",
    "@xmath30 : from qcd and other theories ( see @xcite and reference therein ) 3 .",
    "@xmath31 : from relativistic kinetic theory ( see @xcite and reference therein )    we construct the maximum mass configuration by considering the following structure for the neutron star eos @xmath32 according to eq .",
    "( [ basis-3 ] ) , the eos yielding the maximum mass of neutron stars , is divided into three regions . in particular , above the critical energy density @xmath33 the eos is maximally stiff with the speed of sound @xmath34 fixed to the interval @xmath35 . in the intermediate region",
    "@xmath36 we employed a specific eos which is used for various nuclear models ( see below for more details ) , while for @xmath37 we used the equation of feynman , metropolis and teller  @xcite and also of baym , bethe and sutherland  @xcite .",
    "the crust - core interface energy density @xmath38 , between the liquid core and the solid crust is determined by employing the thermodynamical method  @xcite .",
    "actually , for energy densities lower than @xmath39 the equation of state has negligible effect on the maximum mass configuration , however , we use this additional crust structure in the calculations for the sake of completeness .",
    "we use the following notations and specifications for the results of the theoretical calculations : a ) the case where the critical ( fiducial ) density is @xmath40 and for @xmath41 the speed of sound is fixed to the value @xmath8 ( eos / maxstiff ) , b ) the case where the fiducial density is @xmath40 and for @xmath41 the speed of sound is fixed to the value @xmath42 ( eos / minstiff ) , and c ) the case where the for @xmath43 we simple employ the selected eos without constraints ( eos / normal ) .    in any case",
    ", there are very large number of possible combinations of eos since the critical density @xmath15 and the upper bound of the speed of sound are not fixed from first principles in the interval @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "this results to a variety of eoss lying between the two extreme cases : the eos / maxstiff and the eos / minstiff , which are described in more detail in the next section .",
    "in the present work we employed various relativistic and non - relativistic nuclear models , which are suitable to reproduce the bulk properties of nuclear matter at low densities , close to saturation density as well as the maximum observational neutron star mass ( refs .",

    "we concentrate our study mainly on an estimate of the maximum mass of neutron stars , by taking into account the various constraints on the upper bound of the speed of sound .",
    "we also compare the results with a few recent observations .",
    "in particular , we analyze the tidal polarizability and its possible dependence on the hadronic eos .",
    "indeed , as we shall see , this observable is sensitive to the eos and , hence , can be used as a sensitive probe for the maximum mass configuration .",
    "we start the discussion with fig .",
    "1 . it shows the radius - mass relation of neutron stars using various eos without any restriction on the speed of sound ( except the relativistic one ) .",
    "one can see , that all hadronic models can reproduce the recent observation of two - solar massive neutron stars .",
    "in general , the stiffer eos ( at high densities ) the higher the maximum neutron star mass . this effect is clearly presented fig .  1 for the hlps eos of the soft , intermediate and stiff case . this is a general feature .",
    "it arises from the fact , that for a soft eos the matter can be easier compressed relative to a stiff one .",
    "thus , less gravitational energy is needed for a stable neutron star configuration .    before starting to analyze the effects of the speed of sound limits on the eos",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2 the density dependence of this quantity for the various eoss used here .",
    "it is obvious that almost all the eoss are causal even for high values of the pressure ( the only exception is the case hlps ( stiff ) where the @xmath136 exceed the @xmath137 for relative low pressure ) .",
    "however , it is worthy to mention that in all hadronic models , used in the present study , the speed of sound @xmath5 reaches the bound limit @xmath138 at relative low values of the pressure ( for @xmath139 ) .",
    "this feature has dramatic effect on the maximum mass configuration .",
    "this is now discussed in fig .",
    "3 , where the radius - mass relation for the different nuclear models is shown including the various scenarios for the upper limit of the speed of sound .",
    "the neutron star configurations with the five selected eoss in the normal case ( no constraints on @xmath5 except the conventional @xmath140 ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "it is seen that the upper bound limit of the speed of sound imposes essential changes to the neutron star structure .",
    "the higher the limit after the fiducial density , the stiffer the corresponding eos .",
    "this results to a higher value for the maximum neutron star mass . by setting the upper limit to @xmath42",
    "the stiffness of the eos weakens at higher densities and consequently the neutron star mass is reduces to lower values .",
    "certainly , the results will depend on the onset of the critical density .",
    "however , the effects of the upper bound of @xmath5 on the neutron star structure are too strong .",
    "therefore , the upper limit issue of the in - medium speed of sound should be seriously considered in such studies .    in order to further clarify the critical density dependence on @xmath3 , we display in fig .",
    "4 the dependence of the maximum mass for the chosen eos , on the fiducial density @xmath15 . we considered three upper bounds for the speed of sound : @xmath8 , @xmath42 and the bound originated from the kinetic theory ( see eq .",
    "( [ equal - kin-4 ] ) ) .",
    "first , one sees an overall reduction of the neutron star mass with increasing critical density . using the density behavior of the @xmath42 constraint in the calculations ,",
    "the neutron star mass first decreases and then approaches a constant value , which is characteristic for each eos .",
    "it is remarkable that in all cases the neutron star mass drops below the experimental value of two solar masses ( the only exception is the stiff case of the hlps model ) .",
    "therefore , the assumption of @xmath42 value as the upper limit for the speed of sound in compressed matter would exclude particular eoss which contradict with recent astrophysical observation of massive neutron stars .",
    "our results are similar to those of bedaque and steiner  @xcite .",
    "in that paper the authors found that the existence of neutron stars with masses around two solar masses , combined with a specific eos of hadronic matter at low densities , is inconsistent with the upper limit @xmath7",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when the causality limit @xmath8 is imposed , the upper bound on the maximum mass significantly increases as is well known from previous studies and the relevant predictions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our calculations are in agreement with the observations of the massive neutron stars even for high values of the fiducial densities @xmath15 .",
    "the predictions of the kinetic theory for the @xmath141 are lower but close to those of the causality limit and also in accordance with the observations .",
    "note that recently an upper bound of neutron star masses has been obtained from an analysis of short gamma - ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "according to these studies , most short gamma - ray bursts are produced by the coalescence of two neutron stars , and if the merger remnant collapses quickly , then the upper mass limit is constrained tightly . assuming that the rotation of the merger remnant is limited only by mass - shedding ,",
    "then the maximum gravitational mass of a nonrotating neutron star is @xmath142",
    "@xcite .    in a similar analysis the physical properties of the compact remnant in neutron star mergers have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by combining the results of newtonian merger calculations and equation of state studies . furthermore , using population studies , they determined the distribution of these compact remnants to compare with the observations .",
    "it turned out that black hole cores are formed quickly only for equations of state that predict maximum non - rotating neutron star masses below @xmath143 .",
    "all these recent analyses , although dealing with the problem of the upper bound of neutron star mass in a different ways , predict maximum neutron star masses @xmath144 in agreement with the observation but in contradiction with the imposed upper bound of @xmath42 .    in fig .  5",
    ", we display the dependence of the @xmath3 on the upper bound of the speed of sound and for three different values of the fiducial density .",
    "the dependence is of the form @xmath145 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 , for each case , have been determined by a least - squares fit method .",
    "we consider as an example the case of the mdi model .",
    "the calculations show that the situation is similar to the other eoss . as expected , for the lower values of the fiducial density @xmath15 the values of @xmath3 increase more rapidly with @xmath5 .",
    "obviously the @xmath148 dependence becomes less pronounced and for low @xmath5-values close to the results of the eos / normal case .",
    "we propose now an additional approach to investigate the upper bound of @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we calculate for the eoss used in this work and for the various maximum mass configurations , the corresponding values of the tidal polarizability .",
    "it is well known that the influence of the star s internal structure on the waveform is characterized by the value of the tidal polarizability @xmath10 .",
    "this quantity @xmath10 is actually a measure of the star s quadrupole deformation in response to the companion s perturbing tidal field  @xcite . it has been found that @xmath10 is sensitive to the details of the equation of state .",
    "the love number @xmath110 shows a strong dependence on the compactness parameter @xmath4 ( for high values of @xmath4 decreases very fast ) as well as on the the value of @xmath117 which depends also on the internal structure of the neutron stars .",
    "furthermore , the tidal polarizability exhibits very strong dependence on the radius @xmath114 and consequently on the details of the equation of state at low and high values of the baryons density .",
    "in particular , the maximum mass and consequently the compactness parameter are sensitive to the high density region of the eos .",
    "as confirmed in studies by lattimer and prakash  @xcite , the radius of neutron stars with masses close to @xmath149 depends on the pressure near the saturation density .",
    "this make as to believe that the measure of the tidal polarizability may imposes constraints related with the maximum mass configuration and also the maximum mass of a neutron star involved in a binary neutron star system .",
    "6 shows the dependence of the love number @xmath110 on the mass of a neutron star for the five selected eoss and in comparison with the corresponding maximum mass configurations results ( for the upper bounds @xmath150 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 is obviously model dependent especially for medium values of the mass ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "close to the value of @xmath152 there is a deviation by a factor @xmath153 between the various models .",
    "actually , @xmath110 is strongly dependent on the compactness parameter @xmath4 ( see eq .",
    "( [ k2-def ] ) ) .",
    "for example , in the hlps model , the low values of @xmath110 in the intermediate mass region of @xmath154 is due to the large values of the compactness @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "the interplay between the upper bound of the speed of sound and the stiffness of the eos thus influences in a non - trivial way the love number @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , when imposing the @xmath6-limit on the speed of sound at the fiducial density @xmath155 , the eos effects on @xmath110 are rather moderate for neutron star masses above one solar mass ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "however , when using the conventional causality limit ( @xmath157 ) , the stiffness of the eos becomes more pronounced with significant effects on the tidal love number @xmath110 .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath110 increases by a factor of two or even more relative to the results with the @xmath6-limit .",
    "moreover , the corresponding maximum mass configuration in the causality limit ( @xmath158 at @xmath155 ) gives finite @xmath110-values even for high neutron star masses greater that two solar masses ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "this feature is very different with the one obtained with the calculations using the eos / normal case for each model .",
    "the tidal polarizability is an important quantity , as it can be deduced from observations on neutron star binary systems .",
    "this is shown in fig",
    "the notation is the same as in fig .",
    "the _ signature _ of the maximum mass configuration on the values of @xmath10 is obvious .",
    "in particular , we found that @xmath10 takes a wide range of values ( @xmath160 gr @xmath161 s@xmath162 ) for the employed eos ( eos / normal case ) .",
    "since @xmath10 is sensitive to the neutron star radius , this quantity is directly affected by the eos .",
    "an eos leading to large neutron star radii will also give high values for the tidal polarizability @xmath10 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the constraints of the upper bound on the speed of sound ( eos / minstiff ) leads to a non - negligible increase of @xmath10 for high values of neutron star mass .",
    "however , in the eos / maxstiff case the corresponding increase of @xmath10 is substantial , compared to the eos / normal case .",
    "moreover , in this case the values of @xmath10 remain measurable even for very high values of the mass .",
    "this behavior is due to the strong dependence of @xmath10 on the radius @xmath114 . specifically , according to fig .  3 the increase of the upper bound on the speed of sound influences significantly the maximum mass configuration in two ways .",
    "first , a dramatic increase of the upper bound of @xmath141 .",
    "second , the neutron star radius is significantly increased .",
    "a radius increase by @xmath163 leads already to a rise of the tidal polarizability @xmath10 by @xmath164 .    in the same figure ,",
    "the ability to measure the tidal polarizability from the advanced ligo and the einstein telescope is indicated .",
    "the region of possible observations with the advanced ligo is indicated by the unshaded region .",
    "the einstein telescope has larger ability and will be able to measure the tidal polarizabity in the unshaded and light shaded region ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . it it obvious that the advanced ligo is able to measure @xmath10 and to impose constraints on the eos only for low values of neutron stars . however , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the einstein telescope will increases significantly the region of sensitivity and will offers the opportunity to give more stringent constraints on the equation of state both for low and high values of the density .    note that einstein telescope will be able to measure @xmath10 even for neutron stars with a masses up to @xmath165 and consequently to constrain the stifness of the equation of state . to be more precise ,",
    "from these observations one will be able to test the upper bound @xmath42 .",
    "the simultaneous measurements of neutron star masses m and tidal polarizabilities @xmath10 will definitely help to better clarify the stiffness limits of the equation of state .",
    "these features are shown in our calculations .",
    "for instance , the model within the eos / normal case predicts values of the tidal polarizability @xmath10 , which are out of the detection region of the einstein telescope ( see also the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , the calculations with the eos / minstiff model lead to @xmath10-values , which are just near that sensitivity region .",
    "the eos / maxstiff results show a clear observable signature .",
    "in particular , for intermediate mass neutron stars @xmath166 with large values for the tidal polarizability @xmath10 the upper bound @xmath42 seems to be violated . in view of the above analysis",
    "we conjecture that it is possible with the third - generations detectors to examine closely the extent of the stifness of the neutron star eos and the relative constraints on the upper bound on the speed of sound .",
    "we now discuss the weighted tidal polarizability @xmath133 as a function of the chirp mass m varying the symmetric ratio @xmath135 , as shown in fig .",
    "considering a binary neutron stars system with masses @xmath167 and @xmath168 it easy to show that @xmath169 in this case the weighted @xmath133 is rewritten as @xmath170 .",
    "\\label{aver - tital-2}\\ ] ] we consider again the main three cases ( eos / normal , eos / minstiff , and eos / max stiff ) where for the intermediate region of the density we employ the mdi model with the slope parameter @xmath171 mev .",
    "the three values of the symmetric ratio ( 0.25 , 0.242 , 0.222 ) correspond to the mass ratio @xmath172 ( 1.0 , 0.7 , 0.5 ) ( for more details see also ref .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath173 in measuring @xmath133 of the advanced ligo and the corresponding of the einstein telescope are also presented ( see also fig .  7 for more details ) . from fig .",
    "8 it is concluded that the upper bound of the speed of sound and consequently the maximum mass configuration affects appreciable the chirp mass - weighted tidal polarizability dependence .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for chirp masses @xmath174 .",
    "in particular , for high values of @xmath175 , the einstein telescope has the sensibility to distinguish the mentioned dependence .",
    "it is worth to point out also the the moderate , but visible dependence on the symmetric ratio @xmath135 in each case .",
    "this dependence is more effective for the eos / max stiff case and for @xmath176 .",
    "that is , when the asymmetry of the two masses is very large .    in the present work we mainly deal with the production of the maximum mass configurations and the possibility of their observations",
    "however , it is of interest to study also the maximum mass configurations effects on the corresponding radius ( see also fig .  3 ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "9 . as one can see , the tidal polarizability is sensitive to the neutron star radius @xmath114 .",
    "this @xmath177 behavior is also strongly model dependent .",
    "this complex dependencies result from eq .",
    "( [ love-1 ] ) and , in particular , from the different model dependent neutron star configurations .",
    "therefore , an accurate observation of the neutron star radius @xmath114 or tidal polarizability @xmath10 will also help contribute to a determination of the eos stiffness .    the schematic approach for neutron star matter proposed by olson  @xcite may be simple , however ,",
    "the constraints based on the kinetic theory provide a useful _ guide _ on the upper bound of the speed of sound .",
    "actually , there are many conjectures concerning the upper bound on the speed of sound in hadronic matter but , to our knowledge , the bounds found from the relativistic kinetic theory are the only ones originated from an self - consistent treatment of hadronic matter . we thus consider that it is of interest to present the results due to the relativistic kinetic theory constraints on the eos and to compare them with the upper bounds suggested by other approaches as well as with a future relative observations . in fig .",
    "10(a ) we display the mass - radius dependence when the constraints on the upper limit of the speed of sound are taken into account according the relativistic kinetic theory .",
    "we employ five values for the critical density @xmath15 .",
    "the use of the upper bounds on the speed of sound , imposed by the kinetic theory , lead to values of @xmath3 which do explain the recent observations , even for high values of the critical density @xmath15 .",
    "the increase of @xmath3 as well of the compactness parameter @xmath4 leads , as in the previous cases , to a significant increase on the values of the tidal polarizability @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at high densities and , in particular , the @xmath10-values are inside the sensibility of the einstein telescope .",
    "in the present work , we study in detail , the upper bound effects on the speed of sound on the eos and the bulk properties of a neutron star .",
    "we focus on three extreme limits : the @xmath8 , the @xmath42 and the limit imposed by the relativistic kinetic theory .",
    "our investigation shows that : a ) the constraint @xmath178 on the eos significantly reduces the maximum mass of neutron stars ( @xmath179 ) for a class of nuclear models ( non - relativistic as well as relativistic ) and makes them inconsistent with the astrophysical observations of massive neutron stars .",
    "the constraints @xmath95 and @xmath180 allow neutron star configurations with high neutron star masses , compatible with the recent observations , b ) the tidal polarizability is also sensitive to the eos and the relevant constraints introduces by the speed of sound .",
    "we believe that the simultaneous measure of @xmath181 and @xmath10 will help to better understand the stiffness limit of the equation of state .",
    "in particular , observations with third - generation detectors , will definitely provide constraints for the stiffness of the eos at high density .",
    "this is expected to provide more information related to the upper bound of the speed of sound in hadronic matter .",
    "the accurate estimate of the upper bound of the speed of sound in hadronic matter is greatly important for a consistent prediction of the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
