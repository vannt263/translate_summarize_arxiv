    "in this paper we present an analytical solution to the problem of multiphoton detachment from a negative ion by a linearly polarized laser field .",

    "the theory is valid when the number of photons @xmath0 is large , but usually gives good results as soon as @xmath1 .",
    "we use it to calculate and examine various characteristics of the problem : the total multiphoton detachment rate , the @xmath0-photon detachment cross sections , the spectrum of excess - photon detachment ( epd ) photoelectrons ( the analogue of above - threshold ionization in atoms ) , and the peculiar photoelectron angular distributions .",
    "there are two important physical properties of the multiphoton detachment process : + ( i ) the frequency of the laser field is much lower than the electron binding energy , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy of the bound state ( atomic units are used throughout ) .",
    "this means that multiphoton detachment is an _",
    "adiabatic problem_. the external field varies slowly in comparison with the period of electron motion in the system .",
    "therefore , the general adiabatic theory @xcite is applicable .",
    "as long as the laser field is weaker than the atomic field , the detachment probability is exponentially small with respect to the adiabaticity parameter @xmath4 .",

    ", the volkov wave function describes explicitly the variation of the electron energy in the laser field .",
    "this makes it very convenient for application of the general adiabatic theory , as suggested by ( i ) .",
    "calculations based on the volkov final - state wave function were first done by keldysh @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the idea was developed by perelomov _",
    "@xcite and later reconsidered by faisal @xcite and reiss @xcite .",
    "this approach is usually supposed to give a correct qualitative picture of multiphoton processes . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that , in fact , it produces very accurate quantitative results for the multiphoton detachment from negative ions .",
    "we re - examine and extend the keldysh theory , paying particular attention to the following points .",
    "first , we show that the epd can be accurately described by the theory .",
    "originally , the theory was developed for low - energy photoelectrons @xcite with kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy .",
    "the present approach is valid at any photoelectron energy .",
    "secondly , the angular distribution of photoelectrons is examined in detail .",
    "we show that a nontrivial oscillatory pattern of the angular distribution is caused by the simple and interesting physics .",
    "the photoelectron s escape from the atomic particle is most probable when the field reaches its maximum .",
    "there are two such instants in every period of the laser field @xmath16 , say , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as a result , there are two classical trajectories which lead to the same final state of the photoelectron .",
    "interference of the corresponding amplitudes gives rise to an oscillatory angular dependence of the detachment rate .",
    "there is a similar effect in the single - photon detachment in the presence of a static electric field , where the interference takes place between the two trajectories of the electron emitted up or down field @xcite .",
    "estimate ( [ rlarge ] ) leads to a further simplification of the problem , since the initial bound - state wave function of the atomic system should also be considered at large distances , where it can be replaced by its simple asymptotic form .",
    "the complicated behaviour of the wave function inside the atom , and the corresponding many - electron dynamics have little influence on the multiphoton detachment .",
    "in contrast , use of the wave function with incorrect asymptotic behaviour , e.g. that corresponding to the hartree - fock binding energy , introduces an error , which is exponentially large with respect to @xmath19 . such sensitivity has been noticed in the perturbation theory calculations of the two- and three - photon detachment from h@xmath20 @xcite .    there has been a large number of papers where multiphoton detachment from the hydrogen and halogen negative ions is investigated .",
    "perturbation theory calculations include those based on the hartree - fock approximation @xcite , adiabatic hyperspherical approach @xcite , model potential @xcite , a configuration - interaction procedure @xcite , and the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite .",
    "there are also numerous non - perturbative methods , such as the floquet close - coupling method @xcite , complex - scaling generalized pseudospectral method @xcite , non - hermitian floquet hamiltonian method @xcite , and the @xmath21-matrix floquet theory @xcite .",
    "all the above methods rely on much more involved numerical calculations than those needed in our analytical approach .",
    "however , we believe that the present theory provides accurate answers for most of the multiphoton detachment problems . for illustration purposes , we reproduce a variety of results obtained earlier , including the @xmath0-photon cross sections , total detachment probability , epd spectrum and photoelectron angular distributions for a large range of frequencies and intensities of the field ( sec .",
    "we believe that in some cases our results are more accurate than those obtained previously , due to the correct asymptotic behaviour of the bound - state wave function we use .",
    "the good accuracy we have achieved within the keldysh - type theory is quite useful for the multiphoton detachment problem . on the other hand ,",
    "its validity is very important for the development of an adiabatic theory of more complicated phenomena , such as double ionization @xcite .",
    "the formulae obtained in this paper can be used to estimate probabilities of multiphoton ionization of neutral atoms .",
    "however , the influence of the coulomb field of the positive ion on the wave function of the photoelectron can not be neglected @xcite , and our results for the multiphoton ionization would be less reliable .",
    "consider the removal of a valence electron from an atom or a negative ion by the laser field @xmath22 .",

    "examination of the lowest @xmath0 cross sections throughout table [ hal ] shows that the qualitative explanation of the discrepancy based on ( [ corr ] ) is correct .",

    "also , the best agreement in table [ hal ] is achieved for br@xmath20 , @xmath238 , where @xmath234 is very close to the correct value .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the incorrect asymptotic behaviour of the hartree - fock wave functions can produce significant errors in the multiphoton detachment rates .",
    "this must be kept in mind when comparisons are made between different @xmath0-photon detachment calculations @xcite .",
