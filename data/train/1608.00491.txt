    "critical collapse in general relativity refers to phenomena that occur at the threshold , in the space of initial data , between data that lead to black hole formation ( collapse ) and those that do not .",
    "regular initial data can be classified as supercritical or subcritical according to whether or not they form a black hole .",
    "we refer to the boundary between supercritical and subcritical data as the black - hole threshold , or the critical surface . in type - ii critical collapse , the black - hole mass formed by supercritical data becomes arbitrarily small as the threshold is approached , and scales as a universal power of distance from this threshold .",
    "the exponent in these power laws is referred to as the critical exponent .",
    "critical collapse was first reported in the seminal work of choptuik @xcite , who performed numerical time evolutions of a massless scalar field in spherical symmetry . soon afterwards",
    ", similar results were reported for a radiation fluid , i.e.  a perfect fluid with the ultra - relativistic equation of state @xmath0 @xcite ( where @xmath1 is the pressure and @xmath2 the total energy density ) , and for axisymmetric gravitational waves in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the literature on numerous further numerical experiments as well as theoretical derivations of the scaling laws is reviewed in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", one of us ( cg ) showed that the spherically symmetric , continuously self - similar critical solution for perfect fluid collapse with the equation of state @xmath3 has only a single ( @xmath4 ) unstable mode for the range @xmath5 , which includes radiation fluids with @xmath6 . based on this , and the more general theory given in @xcite , cg predicted power - law scaling for the black - hole mass and angular momentum for initial data with small deviations from spherical symmetry , and computed numerical values for the critical exponents .",
    "in @xcite , the other one of us ( twb ) , together with montero , carried out the first critical collapse simulations of a radiation fluid in the absence of spherical symmetry .",
    "more recently , we generalized these simulations to study critical collapse with angular momentum @xcite .",
    "specifically , we considered a two - parameter family of initial data describing rotating radiation fluids , with one parameter @xmath7 controlling the strength of the initial data and a second parameter @xmath8 their angular momentum .",
    "these simulations confirmed the critical exponents found in @xcite and provided evidence for their universality .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we provide a self - contained derivation of the scaling laws in rotating critical collapse , and in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we demonstrate agreement with the numerical results of @xcite for radiation fluids with @xmath9 . sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] contains a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "consider an analytic family of regular initial data parameterized by two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that , if these data evolve to form a black hole , the black - hole mass @xmath12 and angular momentum @xmath13 obey the symmetries    [ symm ] @xmath14    a sufficient condition for these two assumptions to hold is that @xmath15 corresponds to a spatial reflection of the initial data .",
    "the assumption ( [ qsymm ] ) implies that initial data with @xmath16 form a non - spinning black hole , but not that they are necessarily spherically symmetric . in the following , for simplicity of notation",
    ", we restrict to axisymmetry , so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 become numbers .",
    "the black hole threshold within such a two - parameter family is a curve in the @xmath19-plane that is symmetric under @xmath20 .",
    "we can fine - tune the initial data to the black hole threshold , in practice by bisection along any smooth 1-parameter family of initial data that crosses it .",
    "the general theory of type - ii critical collapse @xcite is based on the assumption that the solution first evolves towards an intermediate regime , during which it is approximated by a universal critical solution that contracts in a self - similar fashion .",
    "the critical solution has at least one unstable mode , however , which ultimately drives the evolution either towards black - hole formation or dispersal . in the following we discuss these different stages of the time evolution separately .      according to our assumption ,",
    "initial data sufficiently close to the black - hole threshold evolve to an intermediate regime during which the solution @xmath21 is given by a critical solution @xmath22 plus linear perturbations . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes a set of first - order in time dynamical variables and @xmath23 a set of @xmath24 coordinates , such that @xmath25 if and only if the spacetime is continuously self - similar ( homothetic ) .",
    "variables and coordinates @xmath26 can be constructed as follows .",
    "if we write the physical spacetime metric @xmath27 in the adapted coordinates @xmath23 as @xmath28 then the spacetime is continuously self - similar with the homothetic vector @xmath29 if and only if all components of the conformal metric @xmath30 are independent of @xmath31 .",
    "if we now choose the surfaces of constant @xmath31 to be spacelike , then @xmath31 is both a time coordinate and the logarithm of overall spacetime scale . in spherical symmetry or axisymmetry , a natural choice for the remaining coordinates would be a rescaled radius @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is , for example , an areal radius , plus two angles .",
    "we could then carry out the usual 3 + 1 split of @xmath34 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the lapse and shift are evolved using first - order in time coordinate conditions , and that the matter is a perfect fluid with the simple linear ( ultrarelativistic ) equation of state @xmath3 , ( as is the case for our simulations in @xcite ) , we could choose the variables @xmath21 to be the first - order metric variables @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the fluid 3-velocity @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",

    "is discretely self - similar and spherically symmetric , and for vacuum gravity it is believed to be discretely self - similar and axisymmetric .",
    "these symmetries are more complicated on a technical level , but the basic ideas presented here are unchanged .",
    "] @xmath49 is the unique growing spherical mode ( @xmath4 ) , and so @xmath50 .",
    "the amplitude of this mode , @xmath51 , depends on the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath17 of the initial data .",
    "@xmath52 is an @xmath53 axial mode , namely either the unique growing one ( in which case we have @xmath54 ) , or the least damped one ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "its amplitude @xmath56 again depends on the initial data .",
    "we normalise @xmath49 and @xmath52 later . when there are two growing modes , we single out both in the analysis because they dominate the dynamics .",
    "when only @xmath49 is growing , we still need to keep track of @xmath52 because it is closely linked to black hole angular momentum : kerr is an axial @xmath53 perturbation of schwarzschild to linear order in @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we now define the specific moment of time @xmath58 which we assume to be in the intermediate self - similar regime . at @xmath59 , the lengthscale of the solution",
    "is then given by @xmath60 and , since @xmath61 , we have the intermediate cauchy data @xmath62 here the sign in front of @xmath49 is that of @xmath1 ; it appears because of the absolute value taken in the definition ( [ def_tau_star ] ) .",
    "we have also defined @xmath63 with @xmath64    for any 2-parameter family of initial data with parameters @xmath19 that obey the symmetries ( [ symm ] ) we define the black hole threshold , i.e.  the critical curve separating supercritical data from subcritical data , by @xmath65 .",
    "we also define @xmath66 , and shall refer to @xmath67 as the critical point . from the symmetry ( [ qsymm ] ) , @xmath68 . to fix the coordinate freedom on the space of initial data to first order about the critical point [ by linear transformations of @xmath10 and @xmath17 that respect ( [ symm ] ) ] , we define the `` reduced parameters '' @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are family - dependent constants .",
    "they will be fixed later .",

    "vanishes at the critical point @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , from the symmetry ( [ psymm ] ) , @xmath1 must be even in @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests that we treat @xmath73 and @xmath76 as the same order of smallness when expanding about the critical point . from the symmetry ( [ qsymm ] ) , @xmath77 must be odd in @xmath74",
    ". we may therefore expand    [ pqdef ] @xmath78    where we have now fixed the family - dependent constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 so that the leading - order terms in these expansions have coefficients of unity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath79 , and the coefficients of the higher - order terms that we have not written out here , also depend on the two - parameter family of initial data because they depend on the nonlinear and non - universal evolution from generic initial data to the universal intermediate regime ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "we have inserted the minus sign in ( [ pdef ] ) as we anticipate that @xmath79 will then be positive : spin should resist collapse .",
    "since the critical surface corresponds to @xmath80 , the expansion ( [ pdef ] ) also implies that , to leading order , the critical surface forms a parabola in the @xmath19-plane .      the key observation for scaling is the following . as discussed above",
    ", initial data sufficiently close to the black - hole threshold pass through an intermediate self - similar phase . during this phase",
    ", we can identify the intermediate cauchy data ( [ data ] ) at @xmath81 .",
    "these constitute two universal 1-parameter families of scale - invariant intermediate initial data , parameterised by the sign @xmath82 of @xmath1 and the parameter @xmath83 .",
    "the scale - invariant data are completed by the overall length scale @xmath84 .",
    "because the evolution equations are scale - invariant @xmath84 , translates into an overall length and time scale of the solution at all subsequent times .",
    "this means that if a feature of the subsequent spacetime evolution has dimension @xmath85 ( where @xmath44 denotes length , in units where @xmath45 ) , then this feature must be proportional to @xmath86 .    in particular , @xmath12 must be proportional to the overall scale @xmath87 of the cauchy data ( [ data ] ) .",
    "moreover , the constant of proportionality can depend only on the sign @xmath82 of @xmath1 and the dimensionless number @xmath83 .",
    "we may therefore express it in terms of two functions @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , @xmath18 must be proportional to @xmath89 , and again the constant of proportionality can be expressed in terms of two functions of @xmath90 . with @xmath91",
    "we therefore have @xcite    [ scaling1 ] @xmath92    we note that the dimensionless quantity @xmath57 can only depend on the sign @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "numerical evidence also shows that collapse actually happens only for @xmath93 , and so in the following we ignore the functions @xmath94 , and write @xmath95 short for @xmath96 .",
    "because of the symmetries ( [ symm ] ) , @xmath97 is even in @xmath83 and @xmath98 is odd .",
    "we can now normalize @xmath49 and @xmath52 in such a way that that , to leading order , as @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 in particular , eqs .",
    "( [ scaling1 ] ) then imply that @xmath101    inserting the leading - order expressions ( [ trivialscalingfunctions ] ) together with the definitions ( [ definedelta ] ) and ( [ defineepsilon ] ) into ( [ scaling1 ] ) yields    [ scaling2 ] @xmath102    where we have also defined @xmath103 in geometric terms , @xmath1 and @xmath77 are locally smooth scalar functions on the manifold of smooth initial data , such that @xmath104 gives the critical surface , and @xmath12 and @xmath18 given by ( [ scaling2 ] ) are non - smooth at the critical surface precisely because of the non - integer powers @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "a related observation is that the power - law scalings of @xmath12 and @xmath18 at the collapse threshold show the same powers for any 1-parameter family of initial data that crosses the threshold , independently of the angle at which the threshold is crossed ( compare table  i in @xcite ) .",

    "hence we expect our model to break down well before it predicts @xmath170 . indeed , we find that further away from the critical point the numerically found masses are larger than predicted , and the angular momenta smaller than predicted , such that @xmath57 increases but never goes beyond unity .",
    "these observations are demonstrated in fig .",

    "we would like to emphasize a difference between figs .",
    "[ figure : mjvsetaplots ] and [ figure : mjvomegaplots ] and and the scaling plots of @xcite . in fig .  2 of @xcite we fitted power - laws to individual 1-parameter families , whereas here we compare the numerical data with predictions for the entire two - parameter family , given the constants @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath132 .",
    "similarly , for fig .  4 of @xcite , which shows the same data as fig .",
    "[ figure : mjvomegaplots ] here , we computed @xmath171 and @xmath172 in ( [ scalingconstpbis ] ) from the numerical data ( which did not require knowledge of the constants @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath132 ) , whereas here we compute @xmath171 and @xmath172 from ( [ mjmax ] ) , using the constants @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath132 .",
    "the agreement found here is therefore a more stringent comparison between theoretical predictions and numerical data than that presented in @xcite .",
    "we have extended arguments previously presented in @xcite to derive new closed - form scaling laws for critical collapse with angular momentum .",
    "the main result , eq .  ( [ scaling1 ] ) , in principle involves scaling functions @xmath95 that need to be determined numerically , but adopting the lowest - order expansions ( [ trivialscalingfunctions ] ) of these scaling functions yields the predictions ( [ scaling3 ] ) .",
    "we have compared these predictions with numerical simulations for rotating radiation fluids and find excellent agreement .",
    "we believe that the agreement between theory and numerics for the mass and angular momentum scaling , even so far from critical collapse that there is no clear sign of an intermediate self - similar regime , is another example of the `` unreasonable effectiveness of perturbation theory '' , similar to post - newtonian approximations @xcite and the close - limit approximation @xcite for binary black hole mergers .",
    "this paper also demonstrates the necessary interplay between theory and numerical experiment in critical collapse . in the previous treatment @xcite cg implicitly truncated the expansion ( [ pdef ] ) as @xmath173 , which renders the black - hole threshold as a straight line .",
    "the numerical results of @xcite showed that the resulting picture is qualitatively incorrect .",
    "in hindsight , @xmath174 , so that the consistent lowest - order truncation of the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath77 is ( [ pqdef ] ) , and the black - hole threshold is a parabola . for the case of one unstable mode , cg correctly predicted the scaling behaviour ( [ scaling2 ] ) for small @xmath74 , but by implicitly setting @xmath175 ( in the notation of this paper ) he missed the equally interesting behavior of ( [ scaling3 ] ) for finite @xmath74 , in particular ( [ scalingconstp ] )",
    ". the formal prediction of nontrivial universal scaling functions ( [ scaling1 ] ) for the mass and angular momentum has not changed , but @xmath83 is now given in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath77 , not @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the lowest - order consistent truncation given by eq .",
    "( [ pqdef ] ) . and fig .",
    "2 of @xcite is , unfortunately , accidental . ]    in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we compared the theory with numerical results the perfect fluids with the equation of state @xmath113 where @xmath6 ( the radiation fluid ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , for @xmath176 the critical solution has only one unstable mode , so that @xmath109 in particular for @xmath9 .",
    "( [ definedelta ] ) then implies @xmath99 as the black - hole threshold @xmath111 is approached , which , by ( [ jm2 ] ) , implies @xmath177 , in agreement with our numerical findings .",
    "it is precisely the fact that @xmath110 at the black - hole threshold that allows us to use the simple expansions ( [ trivialscalingfunctions ] ) for the scaling functions in ( [ scaling2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath178 , on the other hand , we expect two unstable modes , so that @xmath112 , in which case ( [ definedelta ] ) suggesst that @xmath83 grows without bound as @xmath179 . in this case , therefore , use of the expansions ( [ trivialscalingfunctions ] ) can no longer be justified .",
    "we plan to explore this regime in the future .",
    "we would like to stress that the derivation of ( [ scaling3 ] ) relies on at least four logically independent perturbation approximations : ( i ) sufficiently near the collapse threshold",
    "the time evolution actually goes through a phase where it can be described by the critical solution plus linear perturbations .",
    "( ii ) in at least part of this phase , all decaying linear perturbations , except possibly for @xmath52 , can be neglected .",
    "( iii ) the scaling functions can be approximated by their leading orders ( [ trivialscalingfunctions ] ) .",
    "( iv ) the amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath77 can be approximated by their leading orders ( [ pqdef ] ) .",
    "it is hard to know which of these approximations causes the most significant deviations from ( [ scaling3 ] ) as we move away from the critical point .",
    "one might consider adding higher powers of @xmath73 and @xmath74 to the expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath77 as indicated in ( [ pqdef ] ) to control ( iv ) .",
    "however , as @xmath180 and @xmath181 are smooth functions away from the critical surface , we can always make our model fit the data precisely by fitting @xmath51 and @xmath72 , and so this fit has no additional predictive power .",
    "one might also consider extending ( [ trivialscalingfunctions ] ) to a power series in @xmath83 to control ( iii ) .",
    "however , we can already fit the model to the numerics perfectly by fitting @xmath1 and @xmath77 , even if we set @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and so we can not determine these universal functions by such a fit .",
    "they could , however , be defined directly by the time evolution of the two @xmath184-parameter family of universal intermediate initial data ( [ data ] ) .",
    "the scaling functions will play a non - trivial role when there are two unstable modes , as @xmath185 is then still realised as @xmath186 but @xmath187 is realised as @xmath188 .",
    "we note in closing that aguilar - martinez @xcite has presented preliminary numerical results for the critical collapse , in _ newtonian _",

    "the critical solution appears to have two unstable modes in this case .",
    "aguilar - martinez gives theoretical values of @xmath192 and @xmath193 , implying @xmath194 .",
    "the black - hole threshold found in his simulations appears to be well approximated by a parabola .",
    "interestingly , @xmath180 and @xmath181 also approach zero at the black - hole threshold even though there are two unstable modes",
