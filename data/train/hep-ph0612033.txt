    "recent solar,@xcite atmospheric,@xcite reactor@xcite and accelerator@xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very robust evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .",
    "this great breakthrough opens a novel window to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in order to generate neutrino masses ,",
    "the most straightforward extension of the sm is to preserve its @xmath1 gauge symmetry and introduce a right - handed neutrino for each lepton family .",
    "neutrinos can therefore acquire masses via the dirac mass term , which links the lepton doublets to the right - handed singlets .",
    "if we adopt such a scenario and confront the masses of dirac neutrinos with current experimental data , we have to give a reasonable explanation for the extremely tiny neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "this unnaturalness can be overcome , however , provided neutrinos are majorana particles instead of dirac particles . in this case , it is also possible to write out a lepton - number - violating mass term in terms of the fields of right - handed majorana neutrinos . since the latter are @xmath2 singlets , their masses are not subject to the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking . given the dirac neutrino mass term of the same order as the electroweak scale @xmath3 gev , the small masses of left - handed majorana neutrinos can be generated by pushing the masses of right - handed majorana neutrinos up to a superhigh - energy scale close to the scale of grand unified theories @xmath4 .",
    "this is just the well - known seesaw mechanism,@xcite which has been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "there are of course some other ways to make neutrinos massive .",
    "for instance , one may extend the sm with the scalar singlets or triplets which couple to two lepton doublets and form a gauge invariant mass term.@xcite neutrinos can then gain the majorana masses after the relevant scalars gain their vacuum expectation values .",
    "but why is the seesaw mechanism so attractive ?",
    "an immediate answer to this question is that the seesaw mechanism can not only account for the smallness of neutrino masses in a natural way , but also provide a natural possibility to interpret the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the cosmological baryon - antibaryon asymmetry is a long - standing problem in particle physics and cosmology . to dynamically generate a net baryon number asymmetry in the universe , three sakharov conditions have to be satisfied:@xcite ( 1 ) baryon number non - conservation ; ( 2 ) c and cp violation ; ( 3 ) a departure from thermal equilibrium",
    "fortunately , both @xmath5- and @xmath6-violating anomalous interactions exist in the sm and can be in thermal equilibrium when the temperature is much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "fukugita and yanagida have pointed out that it is possible to understand baryogenesis by means of the mechanism of leptogenesis,@xcite in which a net lepton number asymmetry is generated from the cp - violating and out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "this lepton number asymmetry is partially converted into the baryon number asymmetry via the @xmath7-conserving sphaleron interaction,@xcite such that the matter - antimatter asymmetry comes into being in the universe .",
    "the fact of neutrino oscillations and the elegance of leptogenesis convince us of the rationality of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , the seesaw models are usually pestered with too many parameters . in the framework of the sm extended with three right - handed majorana neutrinos , for instance",
    ", there are fifteen free parameters in the dirac yukawa couplings as well as three unknown mass eigenvalues of heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "but the effective neutrino mass matrix resulting from the seesaw relation contains only nine physical parameters .",
    "that is to say , specific assumptions have to be made for the model so as to get some testable predictions for the neutrino mass spectrum , neutrino mixing angles and cp violation . among many realistic seesaw models existing in the literature ,",
    "the most economical one is the so - called minimal seesaw model ( msm ) proposed by frampton , glashow and yanagida.@xcite the msm contains only two right - handed majorana neutrinos , hence the number of its free parameters is eleven instead of eighteen . motivated by the simplicity and predictability of the msm , a number of authors have explored its phenomenology . in particular , the following topics have been investigated : ( a ) the neutrino mass spectrum and its implication on the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double - beta decay ; ( b ) specific neutrino mass matrices and their consequences on lepton flavor mixing and cp violation in neutrino oscillations ; ( c ) radiative corrections to the neutrino mass and mixing parameters from the seesaw scale to the electroweak scale ; ( d ) baryogenesis via leptogenesis at a superhigh - energy scale or via resonant leptogenesis@xcite at the tev scale ; ( e ) lepton - flavor - violating processes ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "the purpose of this article is just to review a variety of works on these topics in the framework of the msm .",
    "the remaining parts of this review are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we first describe the main features of the msm and its minimal supersymmetric extension , and then discuss the neutrino mass spectrum and the lepton flavor mixing pattern .",
    "stringent constraints are obtained on the effective masses of the tritium @xmath8 decay and the neutrinoless double-@xmath8 decay .",
    "is devoted to a summary of five distinct parameterizations of the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "they will be helpful for us to gain some insight into physics at high energies , when the relevant parameters are measured or constrained at low energies . in sec .",
    "4 , we present a phenomenological analysis of the msm with specific texture zeros in its dirac yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "neutrino masses , lepton flavor mixing angles and cp - violating phases are carefully analyzed for the two - zero textures , in which the renormalization - group running effects on the neutrino mixing parameters are also calculated .",
    "assuming the masses of two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos to be hierarchical , we derive an upper bound on the cp - violating asymmetry in the decay of the lighter right - handed majorana neutrino in sec .",
    "we present a resonant leptogensis scenario at the tev scale and a conventional leptogenesis scenario at much higher energy scales to interpret the cosmological baryon - antibaryon asymmetry .",
    "the correlation between the cp - violating phenomena at high and low energies is highlighted . for completeness",
    ", we also give some brief discussions about the lepton - flavor - violating processes @xmath9 in the supersymmetric msm . in sec .",
    "6 , we draw a number of conclusions and remark the importance of the msm as an instructive example for model building in neutrino physics .",
    "in the msm , two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) are introduced as the @xmath2 singlets . the lagrangian relevant for lepton masses",
    "can be written as@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand respectively for the right - handed charged - lepton and neutrino singlets .",
    "after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , one obtains the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath17 and the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of the higgs doublet @xmath20 .",
    "the heavy right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 is a @xmath22 symmetric matrix .",
    "the overall lepton mass term turns out to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath16 represent the column vectors of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 fields , respectively . without loss of generality , we work in the flavor basis where @xmath29 and @xmath21 are both diagonal , real and positive ; i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the general form of @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) are complex .",
    "after diagonalizing the @xmath37 neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) , we obtain the effective mass matrix of three light ( left - handed ) majorana neutrinos : @xmath38 note that this canonical seesaw relation holds up to the accuracy of @xmath39.@xcite since the masses of right - handed majorana neutrinos are not subject to the electroweak symmetry breaking , they can be much larger than @xmath40 and even close to @xmath41 . thus eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) provides an elegant explanation for the smallness of three left - handed majorana neutrino masses .    in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", one may similarly have the supersymmetric version of the msm with the following lepton mass term : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( with hypercharges @xmath45 ) are the mssm higgs doublet superfields . in this case , the seesaw relation in eq . (",
    "2.4 ) remains valid , but @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the vev of the higgs doublet @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath51 to @xmath52 is commonly defined as @xmath53 .",
    "although @xmath54 plays a crucial role in the supersymmetric msm , its value is unfortunately unknown .",
    "let us give some comments on the salient features of the msm .",
    "first of all , one of the light ( left - handed ) majorana neutrinos must be massless .",
    "this observation is actually straightforward : since @xmath21 is of rank 2 , @xmath55 is also a rank-2 matrix with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( for @xmath58 ) are the masses of three light neutrinos .",
    "it is therefore possible to fix the neutrino mass spectrum by using current neutrino oscillation data ( see sec . 2.2 for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "another merit of the msm is that it has fewer free parameters than other seesaw models .",
    "hence the msm is not only realistic but also predictive in the phenomenological study of neutrino masses and leptogenesis .",
    "furthermore , the msm can be regarded as a special example of the conventional seesaw model with three right - handed majorana neutrinos , if one of the following conditions or limits is satisfied : ( 1 ) one column of the @xmath59 dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix is vanishing or vanishingly small ; ( 2 ) one of the right - handed majorana neutrino masses is extremely larger than the other two , such that this heaviest neutrino essentially decouples from the model at low energies and almost has nothing to do with neutrino phenomenology .      as for three neutrino masses @xmath60 ( for @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the solar neutrino oscillation data have set @xmath61.@xcite now that the lightest neutrino in the msm must be massless , we are then left with either @xmath62 ( normal mass hierarchy ) or @xmath63 ( inverted mass hierarchy ) . after a redefinition of the phases of three charged - lepton fields , the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath64 can in general",
    "be expressed as @xmath65 in the above - chosen flavor basis , where @xmath66 is the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) lepton flavor mixing matrix@xcite with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and so on , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . ] .",
    "it is worth remarking that there is only a single nontrivial majorana cp - violating phase ( @xmath71 ) in the msm , as a straightforward consequence of @xmath72 or @xmath73 .    a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data@xcite yields @xmath74 at the @xmath75 confidence level ( the best - fit values : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "the mass - squared differences of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are defined respectively as @xmath79 and @xmath80 . at the @xmath75 confidence level ,",

    "@xmath83 . whether @xmath84 or @xmath85 , corresponding to whether @xmath72 or @xmath86 in the msm , remains an open question .",

    "if neutrinos are majorana particles , the neutrinoless double-@xmath8 decay may occur .",
    "the rate of this lepton - number - violating process depends both on an effective neutrino mass term @xmath97 and on the associated nuclear matrix element .",

    "we have presented a review of recent progress in the study of the msm , which only contains two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "the attractiveness of this economical seesaw model is three - fold :    * its consequences on neutrino phenomenology are almost as rich as those obtained from the conventional seesaw models with three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos . in particular ,",
    "the msm can simultaneously account for two kinds of new physics beyond the sm : the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry and neutrino oscillations . *",
    "its predictability and testability are actually guaranteed by its simplicity .",
    "for example , the neutrino mass spectrum in the msm is essentially fixed , although current experimental data remain unable to tell whether @xmath72 or @xmath86 is really true or close to the truth . *",
    "its supersymmetric version allows us to explore a wealth of new phenomena at both low- and high - energy scales . on the one hand",
    ", certain flavor symmetries can be embedded in the supersymmetric msm ; on the other hand , the rare lfv processes can naturally take place in such interesting scenarios .",
    "therefore , we are well motivated to outline the salient features of the msm and summarize its various phenomenological implications in this article .    in view of current neutrino oscillation data , we have demonstrated that the msm can predict the neutrino mass spectrum and constrain the effective masses of the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "five distinct parameterization schemes have been introduced to describe the neutrino yukawa - coupling matrix of the msm .",
    "we have investigated neutrino mixing and baryogenesis via leptogenesis in some detail by taking account of possible texture zeros of the dirac neutrino mass matrix .",
    "an upper bound on the cp - violating asymmetry in the decay of the lighter right - handed majorana neutrino has been derived .",
    "the rge running effects on neutrino masses , flavor mixing angles and cp - violating phases have been analyzed , and the correlation between the cp - violating phenomena at low and high energies has been highlighted .",
    "it has been shown that the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe can naturally be interpreted through the resonant leptogenesis mechanism at the tev scale .",
    "the lfv decays , such as @xmath0 , have also been discussed in the supersymmetric extension of the msm .",
    "of course , there remain many open questions in neutrino physics .",
    "but we are paving the way to eventually answer them .",
    "no matter whether the msm can survive the experimental and observational tests in the near future , we expect that it may provide us with some valuable hints in looking for the complete theory of massive neutrinos .",
