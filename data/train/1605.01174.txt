    "transporting biological molecules in living cells plays a key role in biochemical interactions , transmembrane signaling , and efficient reactions . in single - particle tracking ( spt ) ,",
    "the motion of proteins or lipids is tracked to determine directly the diffusivity and to understand the biological role of diffusivity .",
    "therefore , it is expected that spt experiments will provide new insight into molecular transport in living cells . in fact",
    ", many spt experiments reveal anomalous dynamics such as subdiffusion , aging , fluctuating diffusivity , and heterogeneous environments in living cells @xcite .",
    "mean square displacement ( msd ) is the most popular observable for characterizing the diffusivity of particles .",
    "there are two different averaging procedures for calculating the msd .",
    "one is the ensemble average , and the other is the time average . the time - averaged msd is defined as @xmath0^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the position of a particle at time @xmath2 tracked by the spt experiments and @xmath3 is the total measurement time . in stationary stochastic processes , these two averages are equivalent with the aid of the law of large numbers .",
    "this equivalence is one of the properties of ergodicity . while ergodicity is a concept in dynamical systems , an observable in a stochastic system",
    "is called ergodic if the time averages of the observable for different realizations converge uniquely to the ensemble average in equilibrium .",
    "this property ensures the reproducibility of measurements in experiments @xcite : long spt measurements give the same result under the same experimental setup .",
    "however , it was reported in spt experiments in living cells that this reproducibility breaks down @xcite , where the time - averaged msd for a fixed @xmath4 does not converge to a constant but fluctuates randomly across in realizations ( random diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "further , other experiments also reveal that time averages of observables such as occupation time and intensity of fluorescence fail to converge to a constant in some non - equilibrium systems @xcite . while there are several distributional limit theorems related to distributional behaviors of time averages in probability theory @xcite , little",
    "is known about the relationship between the stochastic models used in probability theory and the systems in experiments .",
    "therefore , a theoretical foundation of irreproducibility is an important and challenging problem in statistical physics .",
    "ergodicity gives a mathematical guarantee that time averages are equal to the ensemble average , i.e. , it ensures reproducibility @xcite .",
    "mathematically , infinite ergodic theory generalizes the concept of ergodicity , and states that time - averaged observables remain random even in the long - time limit @xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that infinite ergodic theory will play a fundamental role in understanding random transport coefficients observed in spt trajectories @xcite .",
    "however , ergodicity in stochastic processes has been studied in a different way .",
    "if there is a highly stuck region in phase space , a particle can not explore the whole phase space due to the trapping in the stuck region .",
    "such a situation is called weak ergodicity breaking @xcite .",
    "when a system shows weak ergodicity breaking , a time - averaged observable does not converge to a constant even when the measurement time goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "however , distributional behavior of time - averaged observables can be observed in homogeneous systems . in simple random walk , the time - averaged occupation time that a random walker resides in positive region",
    "does not converge to a constant but converges in distribution , known as the generalized arcsine law @xcite .",
    "thus , some time - averaged observables in homogeneous environments do not converge to constants but converge in distribution .",
    "such a time - averaged observable is not reproducible but has a distributional reproducibility because the distribution is universal in the sense that it does not depend on initial ensembles . in stochastic models of anomalous diffusion , several distributional limit theorems for random diffusion coefficients",
    "have been studied to elucidate irreproducibility @xcite . however , there are experimental results which can not be explained by such stochastic models @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill the gap between experimentally observed irreproducibility and distributional limit theorems in theoretical models .    to consider the irreproducibility of the time - averaged msd in diffusion in living cells , we investigate the annealed transit time model ( attm ) @xcite , which has been shown to describe heterogeneous diffusion in living cells @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite show anomalous diffusion and aging of the time - averaged msd .",
    "however , the distributional behavior of the time - averaged msd remains an open problem .",
    "moreover , the exact descriptions of the governing equations for the propagator have not been found so far . in this paper",
    ", we describe the equations rigorously and solve them analytically . within this model , we show that the time - averaged msd remains random even in the long measurement times , i.e. , the diffusion coefficients are irreproducible but have distributional reproducibility in the sense that the distribution of the time time - averaged msd is universal .",
    "in living cells , diffusivity strongly depends on space as well as time , that is , it is heterogeneous diffusion .",
    "one of the simplest models describing such a heterogeneous diffusion process is the langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-dimensional position of a particle at time @xmath3 and @xmath8 is a stochastic process .",
    "such a fluctuating diffusivity results from a fluctuating medium driven by fluctuations of friction or temperature @xcite , diffusion in two - layer medium @xcite , or fluctuations of a diffusing particle s shape . in @xcite ,",
    "dichotomous processes are used for @xmath8 to investigate effects of the underlying stochastic process @xmath8 on physical features of the time - averaged msd . to consider heterogeneous diffusion in living cells",
    ", we have to model the stochastic process of @xmath8 . in a previous study ,",
    "the attm was proposed for modeling heterogeneous diffusion in living cells , where the diffusion coefficient is constant for a random sojourn time and the constant depends on the sojourn time @xcite .",
    "when we consider quenched environment with heterogeneous local diffusivities , sojourn times in slow and high diffusive regions will imply long and short times , respectively .",
    "thus , it is physically natural to assume that the sojourn time is inversely coupled to the diffusion coefficient .",
    "moreover , it is important to consider the annealed model like eq .",
    "( [ lefd ] ) because the annealed framework enables us to treat analytical calculations , heterogeneous environments in cells may not provide quenched environments , and the annealed model is considered to be a good approximation for the quenched model . in this paper , we assume that the diffusion coefficient is coupled to the sojourn time , i.e. , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) as in @xcite . in non - equilibrium situations ,",
