    "astrophysical observations indicate that the matter content of the universe is overwhelmingly dominated by dark matter ( dm ) , the energy density of which exceeds that of ordinary matter by a factor of five . in order to explain the observed abundance of dm , it is reasonable to expect that dm interacts non - gravitationally with ordinary matter .",
    "searches for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dm , which look for the scattering of wimps off nuclei , have not yet produced a strong positive result .",
    "further progress with these traditional searches is hindered by the observation that the sought effects are fourth - power in the underlying interaction strength between dm and standard model ( sm ) matter , which is known to be extremely small .",
    "we propose to search for other well - motivated dm candidates that include ultralight ( sub - ev mass ) scalar particles , which are closely related to axions ( the only difference being the intrinsic parity of the particle , which determines the forms of the interactions with sm particles ) , by exploiting effects that are first - power in the interaction strength between these scalar particles and sm matter .",
    "ultralight scalar ( and axion - like pseudoscalar ) dm in the mass range @xmath0 ev has been proposed @xcite to solve several long - standing astrophysical puzzles , such as the cusp - core , missing satellite , and too - big - to - fail problems @xcite , due to its effects on structure formation .",
    "scalar dm can produce variations of the fundamental constants of nature , which leave distinctive signatures in atomic clock , laser interferometer and pulsar timing observables .",
    "the phenomenally high level of precision already attainable in measurements performed with these systems provides strong motivation to utilise them in searches for scalar dm .",
    "scalar ( as well as axion - like pseudoscalar ) dm may interact quadratically with sm matter as follows : @xmath1 where the first term represents the coupling of the scalar field to the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath2 , the second term represents the coupling of the scalar field to the fermion bilinears @xmath3 , while the third term represents the coupling of the scalar field to the massive vector boson wavefunctions .",
    "the @xmath4 that appear in eq .  ( [ scalar_couplings_quad ] )",
    "are moderately large energy scales that are constrained from stellar energy - loss arguments : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which are stronger than bounds from fifth - force searches : @xmath8 ( note that a fifth force due to the quadratic couplings in eq .",
    "( [ scalar_couplings_quad ] ) arises in the leading order through the exchange of a pair of @xmath9-quanta between two fermions , which generates a less efficient @xmath10 attractive potential , instead of the usual yukawa potential in the case of linear - in-@xmath9 couplings ) @xcite .    the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ scalar_couplings_quad ] ) alter the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath11 and particle masses as follows : @xmath12 , ~\\frac{\\delta m_f}{m_f } = \\frac{\\phi^2}{(\\lambda'_f)^2 } , ~\\frac{\\delta ( m_v^2)}{m_v^2 } = \\frac{\\phi^2}{(\\lambda'_v)^2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the simplest case , in which scalar dm is produced non - thermally and forms a coherently oscillating classical field , @xmath13 , which survives to the present day if the scalar particles are sufficiently light and weakly interacting , scalar dm that interacts with sm matter via eq .",
    "( [ scalar_couplings_quad ] ) produces both ` slow ' linear - in - time drifts and oscillating variations of @xmath11 and the particle masses @xcite .",
    "apart from the coherently oscillating classical fields that ultralight scalar dm can form , ultralight scalar dm may also form topological defects ( tds ) , which arise from the stabilisation of the scalar field under a suitable self - potential @xcite . in this case ,",
    "tds instead produce transient - in - time variations of @xmath11 and the particle masses as a defect temporarily passes through some region of space @xcite .",
    "* bbn constraints . *",
    " astrophysical observations can be used to constrain the interactions of scalar dm with sm matter that appear in eq .",
    "( [ scalar_couplings_quad ] ) . since the energy density of a non - relativistic oscillating scalar field scales as @xmath14 , the strongest astrophysical constraints on the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ scalar_couplings_quad ] ) come from the earliest observationally tested epoch of the universe , namely big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the interactions between scalar dm and sm matter need to be sufficiently weak ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lambda_gamma_quadratic_space_+cmb ] for the case of the quadratic interaction of @xmath9 with the photon ) to be consistent with the measured and predicted ( within the sm ) primordial @xmath15he abundance @xcite .",
    "* pulsar timing searches . *",
    " astrophysical measurements can also be used to directly search for scalar dm . in particular ,",
    "pulsar timing measurements can be used to search for transient - in - time variations of the neutron mass induced by tds @xcite .",
    "a pulsar is a highly magnetised neutron star , which emits electromagnetic radiation and rotates with ( usually a very stable ) period ranging from @xmath16 . assuming that the angular momentum of a pulsar is conserved upon the passage of a defect through a pulsar , then its frequency of rotation would change as follows : @xmath17 . for sufficiently non - adiabatic passage of a defect through a pulsar ,",
    "the defect may potentially trigger a ` pulsar glitch ' event ( which have already been observed , but the exact origin of which is still disputed @xcite ) by triggering vortex unpinning or crustal fracture , in which the source of angular momentum required for the glitch event is provided by the pulsar itself @xcite .     with the photon .",
    "region below yellow line corresponds to constraints from cmb measurements @xcite .",
    "region below blue line corresponds to constraints from comparison of measurements and sm predictions of the primordial @xmath15he abundance @xcite .",

    "region below black line corresponds to constraints from supernova energy loss bounds and fifth - force experimental searches @xcite.,width=359 ]    * laboratory clock searches . *",
    " transition frequencies in atomic , molecular and nuclear systems depend on the values of the fundamental constants and particle masses .",
    "thus , comparing the ratio of two different transition frequencies , @xmath18 , in such systems provides a method of searching for the oscillating - in - time and transient - in - time variations of the fundamental constants produced by scalar dm ( see the reviews @xcite for summaries of the possible systems ) .",
    "the first laboratory search for oscillating - in - time variation of the electromagnetic fine - structure constant has recently been performed in atomic dysprosium @xcite , and the results have been used to place stringent constraints on the parameter @xmath19 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lambda_gamma_quadratic_space_+cmb ] ) @xcite .",
    "* laboratory laser interferometry searches . *  laser and maser interferometers may also be used to search for the oscillating - in - time and transient - in - time variations of the fundamental constants produced by scalar dm @xcite .",
    "an atomic transition frequency @xmath20 and length of a solid @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bohr radius , both depend on the fundamental constants and particle masses . if the frequency of light inside an interferometer is determined by an optical atomic transition frequency and the interferometer arm length",

    "variation of the electromagnetic fine - structure constant thus produces the phase shift : @xmath25 .",
