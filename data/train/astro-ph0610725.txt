    "uhe neutrino detection and astronomy is a compelling cornerstone in astrophysics , possibly correlated to uhecr astronomy @xcite , just nearby gzk cut - off @xcite .",
    "most of past and present @xmath7 detector are tracing muon in underground detectors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this because of proliferous , penetrating nature of the muon . due to the neutrino flux paucity and its low cross - section most of the detector are large as super kamiokande or larger volumes as amanda , baikal or antares ones , looking to @xmath8 future size @xcite . because most of cosmic rays are converting into atmospheric muon secondaries , the muon dawn ward directions are polluted by atmospheric noises .",
    "the up - ward muons , induced by uhe neutrinos charged currents are suppressed because of their parental neutrinos opacity to earth sizes , above @xmath9 tev energy range .",
    "this energy unfortunately lays where astrophysical neutrinos might dominate over atmospheric ones .",
    "horizontal muons might be a better tools for uhe @xmath7 astronomy , but most km@xmath10 detectors are basically vertical string unable to disentangle horizon directions .",
    "however a novel way to observe uhe neutrinos has been proposed since almost a decade @xcite and revived on recent years @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; it is based on horizontal skimming neutrinos whose consequent uhe @xmath11 air - showering by decay in flight in air invade large detection areas .",
    "the energy windows for tau astronomy opens at pev up to few eev energy band which is of great interest .",
    "either uhe neutrino skimming showering in air or up - going uhe tau neutrino interacting within earth , may be leading to skimming parent @xmath11 well amplified by a decay and a shower in flight .",
    "the phenomena of such @xmath11 air - showers remind the double - bang signature @xcite for @xmath12 interaction and soon later @xmath11 decay in water . here",
    "we assume one bang _ in _ and the second bang _ out_. the simplest case of a mountain chain ( like ande ) acting as a target for uhe neutrino has been first considered @xcite , while later the earth itself has been proposed as a beam dump at its edges @xcite , @xcite . their signal is amplified and spread in huge number of secondaries over wide areas .",
    "the @xmath13 conversion into observable tau shower may reach high efficiency at the horizontal atmosphere edges , otherwise ( in upward vertical directions ) their parental uhe neutrinos suffer of severe planet opacity .",
    "the eevs uhe tau shower secondary ( uv - x - gamma - muon bundle ) discover from earth is already at hand either by top mountains telescope as magic ones , or by sharp anisotropy in horizontal showers within auger ande shadows , or by present and future satellites ( like swift , glast and future ideal array detectors in space station , see fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] facing the earth ) ; these showering reminds the eventual pevs @xmath0 hitting electron at @xmath1 boson resonant mass . in analogy",
    "hypothetical uhe susy neutralino may be scattering atmosphere electron at tens pevs resonant energy for @xmath14 s - channel , arriving _ above _ the horizons @xcite . at higher altitudes uhecr",
    "may skim the terrestrial or other planetary atmosphere leading to thin collimated air - showers whose structure is not just like conical vertical ones , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but they often split in twin jets by geomagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a simple analogous gamma originated grazing mechanism may play a role by converting unobservable hard gev - tev or pevs gamma astronomy : while such hard photons are skimming highest quota they are showering in terrestrial , planetary or solar atmosphere altitudes ; their skimming secondaries produce a cylindric cone that may be intersect by a satellite trajectory .",
    "these _ rises and dawns _ at the horizons of hard source into softer one , might lead to transient x sources whose set and re - appearance time may exhibit characteristic terrestrial ( orbital ) lag modulation see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "while the uhe neutrino skimming the earth produces an escaping tau , the consequent decay in flight is constrained by the size of the planet gas layers : on earth the height size ( @xmath15 ) imply a maximal distance : @xmath16 km .",
    "the corresponding maximal tau energy is @xmath17m_{\\tau}c^2\\simeq7.2 $ ] eev . to visualize horizontal air - showers versus vertical ones and upward hortau",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the larger the planet size @xmath18 and the wider its density height scale @xmath19 , the larger is the allowed distance @xmath20 for the tau to fly before decay ( and the higher its correlated energy ) . the atmosphere and the planet density profile rule also the penetrability of the uhe primary neutrino . the case for the earth",
    "has been carefully analyzed in recent papers ( @xcite and @xcite ) and will be reminded later .",
    "the nearest planet as mercury do not offer an atmosphere as the most distant ones .",
    "therefore we consider for skimming uhecr and tau showering in inner planets mars and venus .",
    "the venus distance @xmath20 at horizons is wider by @xmath21 respect the earth one : @xmath22 km corresponding to a maximal tau energy @xmath23m_{\\tau}c^2\\simeq10 $ ] eev . on the other side ,",
    "the mars air density is too small ( @xmath24 of earth one ) to be of great interest for uhecr or eev neutrinos induced showers .",
    "moreover the mars radius in nearly half of the terrestrial one , ( but its height scale is a little longer ) : @xmath25 km , corresponding to a smaller tau energy @xmath26 eev , anyway undetectable by mars thin atmosphere . indeed",
    "only pev or tev cosmic rays might shower at maximal size at martian horizon .",
    "this possibility may be used in gamma astronomy , if future telescope on mars will consider this kind of astronomy .",
    "nevertheless such a low density atmosphere occurs already in high altitude balloons near earth or in highest altitude for skimming gamma at top terrestrial altitudes .",
    "the parameter that must be correlated with the planet size is the propagation length @xmath27 , see fig .",
    "the great advantage of largest gaseous planets in uhe tau - showering is three fold : their size is wider , their height scale is longer and their external density profile are more diluted that terrestrial ones , offering in this way an extreme windows to maximal neutrino energies .    the nearest jupiter planet ,",
    "[ fig4 ] , exhibit the largest radius and it surge as the leading planet for largest @xmath27 .",
    "indeed its radius , @xmath28 km , is eleven times the earth radius , while the atmosphere height @xmath29 .",
    "therefore the consequent maximal horizontal distance is @xmath30 km , while @xmath31 , corresponding to a maximal tau energy @xmath32m_{\\tau}c^2\\simeq4.43\\cdot10^{19}$ ] ev .",
    "surprisingly the best planet for largest tau distances is not jupiter but the nearby saturn fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : the radius @xmath33 is slightly smaller , but its height atmosphere scale is quite larger . indeed",
    "the saturn radius @xmath34 km , is only @xmath35 times our planet radius , but the atmosphere height scale @xmath36 ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] applied in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , as better compared in density profile fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , @xcite , is @xmath37 times the terrestrial @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the resulting @xmath39 km , is the largest in our planetary system .",
    "then the maximal energy for tau is @xmath40m_{\\tau}c^2\\simeq6\\cdot10^{19}$ ] ev . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where saturn size distance /dot - dashed line ) intersect with the tau boosted fly distance .",
    "the case of uranus and neptune planets are comparable ( but of less interest ) because of their smaller sizes and smaller height density growth , as well as because of their larger distances from us .",
    "moons around planets are usually with null atmosphere except for a saturnian moon , titan , of great and peculiar atmosphere density .",
    "one of the critical role of tau air - showers is the parental uhe @xmath12 opacity crossing along the planet cord .",
    "the opacity is related to the electro - weak cross - section dependence on incoming neutrino energy with matter @xcite and , of course , on the planet size and composition .",
    "smallest radius allows greater neutrino energy : for the earth diameter the neutrino cut - off is about @xmath41 ev for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ev for @xmath12 ( because of their marginal regeneration and pile up by higher energies neutrinos toward pev band ) . for this reasons horizontal tau at tens pev or eev",
    "are possible as well as up - taus just at pev energies on earth ( or with a partial suppression @xcite ) .",
    "naturally titan being just @xmath44 km size and @xmath45 average density allows higher energy neutrino crossing , because in vertical direction ( slant depth @xmath46 w.e . )",
    "the out - coming energy ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) maybe unsuppressed even a hundred times at higher values : @xmath47 , see fig.[fig10 ] , in principle a much better screen to look for up - taus showering in the future search of uhe @xmath12 in space .",
    "finally up - ward and inclined tau air - shower at titan may enjoy of the longer atmosphere height scale ( respect to earth ) , which is @xmath48 km , see fig [ fig9 ] , leading to better contained upward showering event at @xmath49",
    "naturally the simplest and nearest and most practical way to look for uhe neutrinos showering at pevs energies or above is facing the sky of our sky : the earth .",
    "the possible way to trace such air - showers are deep valleys ( to enhance the solid angle of the tau air - showers ) , peak mountains , balloons , planes and satellites facing the earth . in uhe neutrino and @xmath11 showering search different experimental frame - work might be used : cherenkov telescope and arrays , scintillator and c.r .",
    "arrays facing mountains or the earth edges see fig.[fig11 ] , @xcite .",
    "cherenkov gamma telescopes as magic ones at the top of a mountains are searching for tens gev @xmath50 astronomy .",
    "the same telescope at zero cost in cloudy nights , may turn ( for an bending angle @xmath51 ) toward terrestrial horizontal edges , testing both common pevs cosmic ray air showers and uhe showering in air , see fig.[fig12 ] . in upward",
    "directions muon and - or gamma secondary bundles by up - going tau air - showers might blaze the telescope , see fig.[fig13 ] . the peculiar magic position on the sea offer the geometry for reflected downward cr on the water .",
    "the absence of correlated muon bundle and the presence of a polarization in cherenkov lights make a clear signature of these mirrored events . indeed",
    "the possible detection of a far ( un - mirrored ) air shower is enriched by : @xmath52 early cerenkov flash even if dimmed by atmosphere screen , @xmath53 single and multiple muon bundle shining cerenkov rings or arcs inside the magic disk in time correlation , @xmath54 muon decaying into electromagnetic in flight making mini showers mostly outside the disk leading to lateral correlated gamma tails .",
    "we estimated the rate for such pevs - eev events each night , finding hundreds event of noises muons and tens of bundle correlated signals each night @xcite , @xcite at horizons . among them",
    "up - going tau air - showers may occur very rarely , but their discover is at hand for dedicated @xmath55 crown arrays on mountains ( see fig.[fig11 ] ) @xciteor in space ( see fig.[fig15 ] ) in correlation among cherenkov and additional scintillator detectors .",
    "the uhecr and uhe neutrino astronomy at horizons may test the expected gzk @xcite neutrino traces and eventual z- burst uhe neutrino parental spectra at highest energy edges @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the search for uhecr and uhe neutrino astronomy is compelling : the puzzles they may solve are fundamental . while uhe neutrino telescope underground are still seeking rare single muon tracks , uhe tau air - shower astronomy may amplify the neutrino and the uhecr skimming the earth or the top atmosphere .",
    "the tau lenght is related to the uhe neutrino energy and to allowable air layer on earth .",
    "new opportunities arise in outer planets as jupiter and saturn , whose radiuses and whose height scale afford huge distances and largest tau energies .",
    "a very peculiar case arise around the small , but denser titan atmosphere able to permit up - tau at energies ( tens pev ) very favorable for uhe neutrino astronomy .",
    "however just to begin the earth from mountains , in deep valleys and on balloons and space is the most actual place to play the search for this novel astronomy .",
    "the auger shadows from the ande might hide a couple of event each year while magic telescope might rush in horizons edges at grb event .",
    "even satellites like pamela and glast might test up - going showers as terrestrial gamma flashes whose nature might be already associated to uhecr or tau showering skimming the earth ."
