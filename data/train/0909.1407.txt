    "besides melting , dislocation generation , and twinning , structural phase transition is also one important physical process in understanding the plasticity of solid ( metallic , particularly ) materials . among various metallic materials ,",
    "iron , due to its critical importance in condensed - matter physics , materials science , geophysics , and human development , have been extensively studied in aiming at understanding its structures and phase transition under extreme conditions .",
    "thereinto , the research on classical phase transition of iron from ferromagnetic body - centered cubic ( bcc ) ground state @xmath2 phase to nonmagnetic hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) @xmath3 phase has a history of more than half a century .",
    "early representative work was carried out in 1956 by bancroft _",
    "@xcite , where they discovered the transition under shock wave compression at pressure around 13 gpa .",
    "thereafter , plenty of theoretical and experimental works have been done to study the structure properties , inner physics , and mechanical features involving this @xmath4 transition process @xcite . among these studies , in 1962 , jamieson and lawson obtained crystallographic evidence for the @xmath4 transition at 13 gpa in static x - ray diffraction experiments @xcite , which confirmed previous shock - wave experiment of bancroft _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; in 1991 , taylor and pasternak reported the onset of the transition in range of 9 - 15 gpa with a large hysteresis width of about 6 gpa @xcite ; in 1997 , boettger and wallace presented theoretical analysis of metastability and dynamics of the transition @xcite ; in 1999 , wang and ingalls suggested three possible models for the @xmath4 transition mechanism @xcite ; and in 2004 , caspersen _ et al .",
    "_ theoretically investigated the influence of shear in the transition based on a multiscale model @xcite .",
    "however , the structural transition is a mutation process , which leads to direct observation of the phase transition very difficult in experiment . and",
    "the abrupt changes in physical and mechanical characteristics also bring about difficulty in theoretically analyzing the dynamic response and micro - behavior of materials .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to carry out systematic simulations at atomic level by using molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "md is a method for computationally evaluating the thermodynamic and transport properties of materials by solving the classical equations of motion at the atomic level .",
    "many preceding works have testified that md is the most conceptually straightforward method and an altogether very utilitarian method for obtaining atomic details . in 2002 , kadau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite realized the micro - simulation of shock - induced phase transition of solid iron along [ 001 ] direction by employing md method with an embedded atom method ( eam ) potential @xcite , showing the micro - features of @xmath4 transition .",

    "@xcite verified the validity of this work . in 2005 , kadau _ et al .",
    "@xcite simulated shock - induced phase transformations in bcc iron induced by shock loading along [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 111 ] directions to research the orientation dependence of the developing microstructure on the crystallographic shock direction .",
    "they found that the fcc phase appeared especially when loading along [ 011 ] and [ 111 ] directions . in 2007 , kadau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite utilized the md method again to simulate the polycrystalline iron in shock loading condition , simulation results correspond properly with experiment @xcite .",
    "these abovementioned md studies have greatly enriched our knowledge of the structural transition of iron and , needless to say , subsequently inspired more simulation works @xcite . in our last work @xcite , we have simulated the @xmath4 structural transition of iron under isothermal compression along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "it was showed that the laminar structure forms along \\{110}@xmath1 planes . on the other hand , when the loading direction is different , both the hcp and fcc nucleation and growth in bcc single crystal iron will occur .",
    "to date , no detailed investigation has been proceeded to study the orientation dependence of hcp and fcc nucleation and growth .",
    "this issue is focus of our present paper .",
    "specially , by adiabatic compression along [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 111 ] directions , in this paper , we investigate the @xmath5 structural phase transition in bcc single crystal iron .",

    "periodical boundary conditions are adopted in all directions .",
    "the original temperature in all samples is set at 60 k by speed calibration method @xcite .",
    "the initial state is manipulated at zero pressure through modulating the lattice constant . here",
    "the lattice constant of all samples is a@xmath16=0.28725 nm . loading with high strain rate of @xmath010@xmath17 along the [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 111 ] directions is implemented by shortening the lattice constants of these three orientations step by step during the nonequilibrium md process . the verlet algorithm @xcite is used to integrate the equation of motion .",
    "the simulation time is up to 200 ps , with the time step set at 2 fs .",
    "special techniques are required to analyze the huge amount of data produced in the md simulations . here ,",
    "the local structure around each atom are resolved by using the topological medium - range - order analysis @xcite technique .",

    "[ pressure ] , where @xmath26=1-v / v@xmath16 and v@xmath16 is the initial volume of the samples . with increasing the compression strain ,",
    "the following prominent features can be seen from fig .",
    "[ pressure ] : ( i ) the transition critical points in the strain - pressure space are t@xmath18}$](0.072 , 14.21 ) , t@xmath19}$](0.071 , 14.66 ) , and t@xmath20}$](0.066 , 14.16 ) for loading along [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 111 ] directions , respectively , which illustrates that the critical pressures of transition are less dependent on the crystal orientations .",
    "this is similar to the recent shock - loading simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the strain of t@xmath20}$ ] is evidently smaller than that of other two critical points , suggesting that sample c begins transition first .",
    "after the critical points the pressure is lowered due to the nucleation of the new phases ; ( ii ) close to the transition critical point t@xmath20}$ ] , the pressure - strain curve for [ 001 ] loading is below other two curves .",
    "this indicates that samples b and c experience a more evident hardening process compared with sample a before phase transition ; ( iii ) the mixed phase intervals are t@xmath18}$ ] to t@xmath21}$ ] , t@xmath19}$ ] to t@xmath22}$ ] , and t@xmath20}$ ] to t@xmath23}$ ] for loading along [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 111 ] directions , respectively .",
    "obviously , the mixed phase interval in [ 011 ] loading is much shorter compared with that in [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] loadings .",
    "this is due to the fact that the compression direction in sample b is parallel to the nucleation planes ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "consistent with previous reports @xcite , in our simulations we have also observed two main steps during structural transition of iron : firstly , atoms in nucleation planes \\{011}@xmath1 are compressed to form a hexagonal structure ; secondly , neighbor \\{110}@xmath1 layers experience a relative slip to transform into hcp structure .    under adiabatic compression , the temperature is set free , i.e. , not controlled artificially .",
    "thus the temperature evolution with the strain can be calculated based on our data .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ temperature ] .",
    "one can see that the temperature values at the three starting transition critical points ( namely , t@xmath18}$ ] , t@xmath19}$ ] , and t@xmath20}$ ] ) are all near 64 k , which further implies that the onset of phase transition is insensitive to the loading orientations .",
    "right after the onset of the phase transition , however , loadings along the three different directions display remarkably different temperature effects by the fact shown in fig .",
    "[ temperature ] that the temperature is higher one by one with a sequence of [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] , and [ 111 ] in loading orientation .",
    "while the temperatures of samples b and c change up to 185 k and 223 k , the temperature of sample a only increases to 102 k at the end of loading .",
    "also , the temperature increase style is different .",
    "the temperature of sample a increases in an up - stair - like manner , which can be seen more carefully near the labels t@xmath18}$](0.072 , 63.63 ) , t@xmath21}$](0.104 , 81.17 ) , and followed by a sawtooth - like slope after exceeding the strain of 0.136 . here",
    ", the temperature climb up the first stair may contribute to the first step of transition mechanism .",
    "this up - stair - like process only costs about 2 ps .",
    "then , the temperature keeps almost no change until the second stair .",
    "the second and third stairs in the temperature of sample a have strong relation with the second step in the structural transition of iron .",
    "closer view can find that the temperature fluctuates dramatically after the third stair and only mildly fluctuates after the first two stairs .",
    "these features of temperature in sample a has not been observed in samples b and c. instead , the temperatures in samples b and c first alter suddenly up to 110 k and 142 k from the initial value of @xmath064 k , respectively in 5.3 and 9.3 ps",
    ". then they increase steadily with strain . on the whole , the remarkable distinction in temperature before and after phase transition illustrates the substantial structural and energetic complexity during transition process .",
    "although the main transition mechanism remains the same for the three kinds of loadings , the details are significantly different .",
    "this can be seen from the phase mass fraction analysis .",
    "figures 3(a)-(c ) show the mass fraction @xmath27 for the hcp and fcc phases during their evolution with the loading strain along the three directions , respectively . in the overall view , the variations of the mass fraction of close packed ( fcc / hcp ) phases as a function of strain in all three samples are similar to that of temperature .",
    "therefore , the temperature and the nucleation of close packed phases have tight relation . in addition , while most atoms in sample a nucleate into the hcp structure , in samples b and c there will emerge near half proportion of fcc atoms .",
    "this is similar to the observation in shock - wave loading simulation @xcite , where it was found that the hcp / fcc ratio within a grain decreases the more the shock direction deviates from the [ 001]@xmath1 direction of the initial polycrystal . in our study , with the pressure increasing , more fcc atoms will form when loading along [ 011 ] and [ 111 ] directions .",
    "the hcp mass fraction decreases with the increase of fcc phase mass fraction , which indicates that the nucleation of fcc is due to the slip of neighboring hexagonal layers .        .",

    "direction , on the contrary , only a few bcc atoms dispersively distribute among bulk hcp and fcc atoms when the loaded strain is over 0.075 .",
    "this further implies that the mixed phase interval in sample b is shorter than in other two samples .    for the [ 001 ] loading , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 001 ] , some fcc - phase atoms only appear in mixed phase interval and nucleate on ( @xmath2810)@xmath1 plane . with increasing pressure",

    "these nucleation planes all belong to the \\{110}@xmath1 family .",
    "more specially , the fcc atoms first nucleate as a flaky structure [ fig . [ 011](a ) ] , then , together with hcp atoms , evolve into the thin samdwich structure perpendicular to the compression direction [ see fig .",
    "[ 011](b ) , [ 011](c ) , [ 011](f ) , [ 011](g ) , and fig .",
    "[ morphology](d ) ] . at the end of loading , the fcc and hcp atoms form stacking fault structure and relatively thick samdwich structure [ fig .",
    "[ 011](d ) and [ 011](h ) ] .",
    "therein , the samdwich structure is divided by the grain boundaries , which can be more clearly seen from the yellow atoms in fig .",
    "[ morphology ] .",
    "note that the grain boundary planes are ( 011)@xmath1 planes and perpendicular to the compression direction .",
    "for loading along [ 111 ] ( see fig .

    "loading , the @xmath4 transition happens in the whole body of the sample and fcc structure only appears as the intermediate structure .",

    "loadings is that for the latter , there occurs an evident relaxation process after the critical point .       for crystals compressed along [ 001 ] ( a ) , [ 011 ] ( b ) , and [ 111 ] ( c ) directions .",

    "the slip investigation of atoms must presume upon radial distribution function ( rdf ) analysis and phase mass fraction analysis .",
    "figure [ rdf ] displays the rdfs under different compressions , where the strains of all three samples are from 0 to 0.15 .",
    "the ideal positions of fcc and hcp structures have also been plotted .",
    "along with the increase of strain the first peak in all three samples deviates towards left gradually , while the second peak deviates towards the first peak and disappears finally .",

    "[ rdf ] ) exactly the same as that of the second peak of the fcc / hcp phases .",
    "therefore , these changes in rdfs definitely signify atomic transformation to the close packed phases .",
