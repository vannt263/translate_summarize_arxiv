    "in recent years , multi - tip scanning tunneling microscopes ( stm ) have become popular instruments @xcite .",
    "the most common experiments reported in literature using those instruments are multi - probe measurements that allow to determine the microscopic electrical properties of the samples under investigation .",
    "however , such devices can be further extended with scanning tunneling potentiometry ( stp ) techniques which allow to map the electric potential on the nanoscale with spatial and potential resolution of few   and v , respectively @xcite .",
    "combination of stp with multi - probe point measurements creates a powerful tool for the electrical sample characterization capable to give insight into fundamental transport properties , such as the influence of defects on the local electric transport .",
    "this applies especially for surface dominated transport as present e.g. in topological insulators and allows the investigation of transport phenomena such as the landauer dipole @xcite .        since the invention of stp by murlat and pohl @xcite several different technical implementations of stp",
    "have been reported mostly in single - tip stm setups @xcite for which the transport field is usually applied to macroscopic sample contacts up to several mm away from each other . as a result ,",
    "the current density in the region of measurement can be low , resulting in a bad signal - to - noise ratio of the measured electric potential distribution throughout the sample surface . to circumvent this problem , patterning metallic contacts on the sample surface",
    "was reported to increase the current density across the structure under investigation @xcite . however , the patterning process often results in contamination of the sample surface .",
    "in contrast , multi - tip stm setups have the advantage of flexible _ in situ _ contacting the sample with several electrodes , e.g. molecular beam epitaxy grown films and nanostructures without additional sample processing @xcite . as a result , by variation of the spacing of the electrodes the current density in the surface and also through the bulk",
    "can be measured and controlled @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the direction of injected current can be varied by repositioning of the electrodes enabling the quantification of transport anisotropies @xcite .",
    "multi - tip stp implementations have been reported that facilitate the above mentioned advantages over single - tip setups @xcite . however , these implementations are based on additional hardware such as external power sources and feedback electronics that need to be added to existing setups in order to enable potentiometry measurements @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we present here a software based multi - tip stp technique that can be readily implemented into existing multi - tip setups without installation of additional hardware .",
    "we use a home - built room temperature four - tip stm in besocke / beetle - based design with electrochemically etched tungsten tips .",
    "each tip has an individual ring for xy - motion and a tube piezo for z - motion @xcite .",
    "atomic resolution on si@xmath1  is achieved with each tip .",
    "the stm is equipped with a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) for precise positioning of the individual tips .",
    "each of the four tips is connected to one of four instances of equivalent electronics which can be switched between current or voltage measurement , as also done in other four - tip stm setups @xcite . for current measurement ,",
    "the voltage applied at each tip can be set individually .",
    "furthermore , the sample can be either on floating or ground potential . in stp measurements three of the four tips are in current probe mode , two current injection tips ( tip 1 and 2 ) and the scanning tip ( tip 3 ) .",
    "the fourth probe is operated in voltage probe mode and is used as a reference voltage probe ( tip 4 ) .",
    "this tip is optional such that the presented implementation is also applicable for three - tip stm setups .",
    "a schematic of the setup is shown in fig .  [ 1 ] .",
    "the four biasing electronics units are connected to a commercial multi - tip stm controller with individual digital - to - analog converters ( dac ) outputs to address the bias voltage for each tip and analog - to - digital converters ( adc ) to read out the current or voltage at each tip .",
    "figure  [ 2 ] shows a schematic of the biasing electronics which is typical for a multi - tip setup @xcite .",
    "the present setup is based on a femto dlpca-200 current amplifier @xcite and allows variable - gain current measurement or voltage measurement . for current measurement",
    "the tip is connected to the input of the current amplifier which is floating on bias potential @xmath2 . from the output of the current amplifier ,",
    "the bias voltage is subtracted before the signal is fed to the output @xmath3 . for voltage measurement",
    "the tip is connected to a high input impedance ( @xmath4 ) voltage follower with its output connected to the @xmath5 output of the electronics .    in high resolution stp measurements , the control of @xmath2 of the scanning tip in the range of v",
    "is required .",
    "this can be achieved by a voltage divider ( e.g. @xmath6 ) which is applied just in front of the @xmath2 input of the scanning tip biasing electronics .",
    "this decreases the dynamic range of the voltage which can be applied to this tip accordingly . not to be limited by this ,",
    "the topography tip - sample tunneling bias voltage is applied to the sample rather than the tip as described below .",
    "is applied via the differential input in front of which the optional voltage divider for the scanning tip is located . ]",
    "is plotted as a function of the lateral coordinate @xmath7 . during topography feedback , the solid green line holds . for potentiometry feedback @xmath8",
    "is shifted by @xmath9 resulting in the dashed blue line . moving the scanning tip by an amount @xmath10 results in a change of the potential under the tip by @xmath11 .",
    "note : the movement of the scanning tip is largely exaggerated in this graph . ]",
    "the multi - tip stp implementation presented here is based on the interrupted feedback loop single - tip stp implementation reported in ref . .",
    "in this technique the surface is scanned point - by - point as in regular stm measurements .",
    "however , at each scanning point after the topography value @xmath12 is acquired , the tip is held at constant height and the bias voltage between scanning tip and sample is shifted .",
    "now the potentiometry feedback is run for a time @xmath13 .",
    "the final value of the potentiometry feedback is saved as the sample potential at the momentary position of the scan @xmath14 . after restoring the topography bias voltage ,",
    "the topography feedback is re - enabled and the scan is continued by moving to the next scan position @xcite .",
    "the flow chart of the measurement procedure is shown in fig .  [ 3 ] . in this way topography and potentiometry signal",
    "are acquired point - by - point across the sample surface .",
    "depending on the feedback time @xmath15 and the number of scan points a whole scan takes up to several hours .",
    "the potentiometry feedback is a pi - feedback algorithm just like the one used for the topography feedback .",
    "however , it adjusts the tip voltage as control variable instead of the tip height ( in topography feedback ) and the process variable set point ( i.e. the tunneling current ) is set to @xmath16 during the potentiometry feedback .",
    "the corresponding feedback constants determine the bandwidth of the potentiometry feedback and have to be adjusted for each measurement .",
    "in order to perform a potentiometry measurement , first the sample ( connected to ground ) needs to be contacted by the two current injecting tips ( tip 1 and 2 ) .",
    "after coarse approaching all four tips to the sample surface , the current injecting tips are brought into contact to the surface under tunneling conditions of e.g. @xmath17 ; @xmath18 .",
    "one after the other , the current injection tips are advanced further by a few nm with disabled topography feedback until a stable current ( @xmath191% variation per minute ) of up to several a is measured between that tip and the sample .",
    "typically , there is a sharp increase of the current as the tips come into contact to the surface after which the tips should not be advanced further to prevent damage to the tips or the sample surface .",
    "however , if at this point the resulting current is unstable , advancing the tips a bit further can help to stabilize the contact .",
    "next , the optional reference voltage probe ( tip 4 ) is brought into contact to the sample surface in the same way ( in current measurement mode ) .",
    "when a stable contact is achieved , the electronics of this tip is switched to voltage measurement .",
    "this tip serves to measure the reference voltage which can be used during the measurement preparations as described below but also to compensate small fluctuations in the current injecting contacts during measurements @xcite : changes of the contact resistance in the current injecting contacts result in a change of the sample potential at the point of current injection .",
    "this will directly influence the measured potential at the position of the scanning tip and can be compensated by subtracting the potential of a static reference voltage probe from the measured potential of the scanning tip .",
    "now the sample backside contact is disconnected such that the electric potential of the sample depends only on the potential of the two current injecting tips .    to approach the scanning tip ( tip 3 ) ,",
    "the voltage of both injection tips is set to 0 v while that of the scanning tip is set to e.g. @xmath17 .",
    "then the tip is approached to the sample surface until it is in tunneling contact ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "subsequently , a topography scan should be performed to check if the scan area is suitable for potentiometry measurements .    to apply a transport field , first the scanning tip ( tip 3 ) is retracted and its voltage is set to @xmath21 .",
    "now the voltage of the injection tips is set such that a lateral current @xmath22 a results in a potential distribution @xmath14 over the sample surface .",
    "subsequently , @xmath14 is shifted until the sample potential under the scanning tip is approximately @xmath23 .",
    "this can be done using the information of the voltage probe . in order to adapt @xmath14 at the position below the scanning tip , the voltage of both current injecting tips is shifted identically , maintaining the injected current @xcite .",
    "next , the bias voltage for the topography measurement @xmath9 is added to the voltage of the current injecting tips . for high resolution measurements the voltage divider",
    "is now applied to @xmath2 of the scanning tip . following the described preparations , the tunneling contact of tip 3 is re - engaged and the stp scan can be started . figure  [ 4 ] shows a schematic of the potentiometry measurement setup with the voltages applied to the tip and sample indicated , respectively .    in stp , the voltage difference between the scanning tip and sample @xmath24 usually referred to as bias voltage at the scan position @xmath25 is the superposition of the lateral transport field , the offset voltage and the momentary voltage applied to the tip during topography feedback @xmath26 ( solid green line in fig .  [ 4 ] ) . when starting the stp scan , after acquiring the topography at the momentary scan position , the topography feedback is deactivated and the injection tip voltages are shifted by @xmath27 leaving only @xmath14 applied to the sample resulting in @xmath28 ( dashed blue line in fig .",
    "subsequently , the potentiometry feedback loop is activated and adjusts @xmath2 to the local sample potential under the tip @xmath29 .",
    "after the feedback time @xmath15 , the potentiometry feedback is deactivated .",
    "@xmath2 is recorded as the sample potential at this scan position and is maintained until the next activation of the potentiometry feedback loop . after restoring the topography bias voltage @xmath26 ,",
    "the topography feedback is re - activated and the tip is moved to the next scan position .    note that , for neighboring scan positions ( @xmath30 ) , the local sample potential varies by an amount of @xmath11 during the topography feedback . in detail , during the topography feedback it holds @xmath31 . however , in usual measurements @xmath32 such that the change in @xmath8 for neighboring scan positions can be neglected @xcite .    for the potentiometry feedback to work in an optimal way it is recommended that the tunneling @xmath33 curve of the scanning tip is linear , such that a change in the control variable ( tunneling voltage ) will have a linear effect on the process variable ( tunneling current ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the fundamental noise limit of the potential measurement which is the sum of thermal ( johnson ) noise and the amplifier noise the limit of the potentiometry resolution is @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the noise level of the current amplifier @xcite .",
    "low tunneling voltages and high tunneling current setpoint depending on the bandwidth @xmath38 of the setup are necessary for low noise potentiometry measurement @xcite . for transport measurements with several mv of voltage drop across the scan area , we determine @xmath39 as the feedback loop speed for which a good signal - to - noise ratio is achieved while a relatively high scanning speed is maintained . for this bandwidth ,",

    "the thermovoltage between the scanning tip and the sample surface is usually undesired in transport measurements and the identification and reduction of these effects gives a good first insight in the investigated sample system and hinder unwanted effects in later transport measurements .    to measure the thermovoltage , a potentiometry scan is performed during which the sample is on ground potential and no transport field i.e.",

    "a strong increase in the potentiometry signal by a factor of around 10 is observed , confirming its nature to be due to thermoelectric effects as seen in the topography and potential map in fig .  [ 5 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively @xcite . in the potential map ( fig .  [ 5 ] ( d ) ) oscillations in the sample potential can be observed .",
    "these oscillations appear pronounced in fig .  [ 5 ] ( f ) and can be identified as a standing wave pattern which can be explained by thermoelectric effects @xcite .    when two materials are in tunneling contact , the thermovoltage present at the tunneling junction is proportional to the difference of the squared temperatures of the two materials @xcite .",
