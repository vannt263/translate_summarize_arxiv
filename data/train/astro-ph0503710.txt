    "<S> the dynamics of the inner disk of many galaxies is dominated by bars . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , resonances between the bar and the disk become an important factor . in order to detect resonances , we measure angular and radial frequencies of individual orbits in n - body models of barred galaxies . in our simulations with several million particles , stellar disks are immersed in live halos of dark matter . a bar forms spontaneously and interacts with the disk through resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 9 of them . </S>",
    "<S> the corotation ( cr ) and the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) are the most significant . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distributions of particles trapped at these resonances show that ilr is not localized at a given radius . </S>",
    "<S> particles trapped at ilr lie along the bar spanning a wide range of radii . on the other hand , particles at the corotation resonance form a ring around the corotation radius . </S>",
    "<S> we study how orbits evolve near corotation and how they are trapped . </S>",
    "<S> when an orbit is getting trapped , it evolves strongly , but after that there is little evolution . </S>",
    "<S> those trapped orbits circulate along the corotation ring or librate around a stable lagragian point . </S>",
    "<S> the same technique is applied to study resonances in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> the bar interacts strongly with the halo particles that stay close to the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find the corotation resonance and the inner lindblad resonance for halo particles .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper contains the figures presented in the conference : \" dynamics of galaxies : baryons and dark matter  ( las vegas , nv , march 2005 ) . the full talk is available in http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/dept/html/directory.grads.danielcv.shtml </S>"
