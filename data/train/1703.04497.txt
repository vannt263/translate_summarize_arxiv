    "the creation of novel materials with optimal properties for diverse applications requires a fundamental understanding of the factors that govern the formation of crystalline solids from various mixtures of the elements .",
    "compounds of the non - metallic elements of column 6a , oxygen , sulfur and selenium , are of particular interest .",
    "they serve in a large variety of applications in diverse fields of technology , e.g. , chemistry , catalysis , optics , gas sensors , electronics , thermoelectrics , piezoelectrics , topological insulators , spintronics and more .",
    "@xcite . given the very large number of possibilities , many of the alloy systems of these elements have not been fully investigated , some of them even not at all .",
    "in recent years , high - throughput computational techniques based on _ ab - initio _ calculations have emerged as a potential route to bridge these experimental gaps and gain understanding of the governing principles of compound formation @xcite , leading to the creation of large databases of computational materials data @xcite . yet , these computational approaches are practically limited by the number and size of structures that can be thoroughly analyzed , and fundamental issues that limit the applicability of standard semi - local dft for non - metallic compounds . the sought - after governing principles",
    "are thus still largely unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the considerable body of experimental data that is already available , although by no means complete , is a useful basis for large - scale data analysis .",
    "this experimental data is usually presented in compendiums that lack statistical analysis , making it difficult to identify trends and gain insights regarding why some compounds are there and others are not , and also which missing compounds should be expected to be revealed by targeted experimental or theoretical probing . presenting this data in a structured manner may be conducive for gaining such insights into the essential factors that determine structure formation , and may help to provide material scientists with the necessary foundation for rational materials design .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     these diagrams highlight the similarities as well as important differences between the three families of compounds . in all three cases ,",
    "the most common stoichiometries appear on the symmetry axis of the diagram , i.e. , at equal concentrations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components , or very close to it . for the oxides , they are concentrated near 0.5 - 0.6 fraction of oxygen , representing the @xmath2o@xmath3 and @xmath2o@xmath4 stoichiometries , respectively , and form a very dense cluster with many similar reported stoichiometries of lower prevalence . outside this cluster ,",
    "the occurrence of reported compositions drops sharply , and other regions of the diagram are very sparsely populated , in particular near the vertices of the @xmath1 and o components .",
    "the sulfide and selenide diagrams also exhibit prominent clusters on the @xmath5 symmetry axes , but they appear at a lower s or se concentration of about 0.5 , i.e. , @xmath6 stoichiometry .",
    "they are considerably more spread out and include a significant contribution at the @xmath7 stoichiometry . in both sulfides and selenides , an additional minor cluster appears closer to the @xmath0 vertex , a few members of this cluster are ternary oxides , reflecting the high electronegativity , and high mendeleev number ( 101 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath8 vertex regions are still sparsely populated , but less so than in the oxides case .",
    "overall , the sulfide and selenide diagrams are very similar to each other and different from that of the oxides . they are more spread out and less @xmath5 symmetric than the oxide diagram and less tilted towards high @xmath8-component concentration",
    ". this discrepancy may reflect some uniqueness of oxygen chemistry compared to sulfur and selenium , or rather simply reflect the oxygen rich environment in which naturally formed compounds are created in the atmosphere .",
    "the number of stoichiometries and the differences in the @xmath8-component concentration are summarized in table  [ table : ternary_stoi ] .",
    "another interesting observation is that while some stoichiometries are abundant in the oxides they are almost absent in the sulfides or the selenides .",
    "for example , there are 299 compounds with the @xmath9o@xmath10 stoichiometry ( ignoring order between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , but only two @xmath9s@xmath10 compounds and no @xmath9se@xmath10 compounds . also , there are 71 @xmath13o@xmath14 compounds but no @xmath13s@xmath14 and @xmath13se@xmath14 compounds . on the other hand , there are no @xmath15x@xmath16 oxides , but 20 sulfides and 8 selenides .",
    "if we require that @xmath17 - there are no oxides of the @xmath18 stoichiometry , but 25 sulfides and 7 selenides .",
    "the occurrence of each element in the binary and ternary compound lists has been counted and tabulated .",
    "the results are described in figure  [ fig : fig10_mendeelev_distribution_all_in_one ] . for the binary oxides a very prominent peak appears at @xmath19 , the mendeleev number of silicon .",
    "it represents the 185 different silicon oxide structures types ( s.t . )",
    "reported in the  database for just a _ single _ stoichiometry , sio@xmath3 .",
    "smaller peaks appear for @xmath20 ( titanium , 42 s.t .",
    ", 14 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is tio@xmath3 with 14 s.t . ) , @xmath21 ( vanadium , 42 s.t . , 18 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is vo@xmath3 with 10 s.t . ) , @xmath22 ( tungsten , 24 s.t . ,",
    "9 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is wo@xmath4 with 13 s.t . ) , and @xmath23 ( uranium , 22 s.t . , 9 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is uo@xmath3 and u@xmath4o@xmath24 with 6 s.t .",
    "unlike the silicon peak which is composed of a single stoichiometry , the other leading peaks evidently include multiple stoichiometries , reflecting the different chemistry of those elements .",
    "these differences also carry over into the ternary oxide compounds involving those elements .",
    "for example , the stoichiometry distribution of silicon oxide ternaries is more tilted towards the silicon poor compounds compared to the corresponding distributions of vanadium and titanium ternary oxides , as is shown in figure s3 in the si .",
    "the distribution of the sulfides is generally much lower than that of the oxides , due to the much smaller total number of known binaries , but is also more uniformly structured .",
    "it has one major peak for @xmath25 ( zinc , 40 s.t . ,",
    "2 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is zns with 39 s.t . ) , and quite a few smaller ones such as @xmath20 ( titanium , 16 s.t . , 5 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is tis@xmath3 with 9 s.t . ) , @xmath26 ( iron , 18 s.t . , 5 stoichiometries",
    ", leading stoichiometry is fes with 6 s.t . ) , @xmath27 ( nickel , 16 s.t . , 6 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is nis@xmath3 with 8 s.t . ) , @xmath28 ( phosphorus , 13 s.t . , 8 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometries are p@xmath3s@xmath10 , p@xmath29s@xmath14 , p@xmath29s@xmath30 , p@xmath29s@xmath31 and p@xmath29s@xmath4 with 2 s.t",
    "the @xmath32 region also exhibits a minor concentration of participating elements .",
    "the selenides distribution is yet smaller than that of the sulfides , and even more uniform .",
    "several peaks appear , @xmath20 ( titanium , 13 s.t .",
    ", 9 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is tise with 3 s.t . ) , @xmath33 ( niobium , 15 s.t . , 8 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is nbse@xmath3 with 8 s.t . ) , @xmath34 ( tantalum , 15 s.t . , 4 soichiometries , leading stoichiometry is tase@xmath3 with 10 s.t . ) and @xmath35 ( indium , 14 s.t . , 5 stoichiometries , leading stoichiometry is in@xmath3se@xmath4 with 6 s.t . ) .",
    "all distributions cover most of the elements except two obvious gaps , one at @xmath36 , which includes the noble gases and the two heaviest alkali metals , cesium and francium , and another at @xmath37 which represents the heavy actinides .",
    "another gap appears in the sulfide and selenide distributions at @xmath38 , which reflects the rarity of polonium and astatine compounds and shows that the elements of the 6a column , except oxygen , do not coexist , in the known compounds , with each other or with the heavier halogen iodine .",
    "the element occurance distributions for the oxide , sulfide and selenide ternaries exhibit greater similarity than the corresponding binary distributions .",
    "the most apparent difference , however , is the identity of the most common component , which is sulfur , @xmath28 , in the oxides , but oxygen itself , @xmath39 , in the sulfides and selenides .",
    "the sulfide and selenide distributions are almost the same , except for generally lower numbers in the selenides ( due to the smaller total number of compounds ) and an apparent lower participation of the lantanides @xmath40 .",
    "mendeleev maps for the ternaries are shown in figures  [ fig : fig11_mendeleev_bigger_x_upper_all_in_one]-[fig : mendeleev_sulfur_selenium_prototypes ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig11_mendeleev_bigger_x_upper_all_in_one ] shows the cumulated maps for all stoichiometries reported for the respective ternary family .",
    "they reflect the same major gaps as the binary distributions .",
    "the maps show that most of the reported compositions are represented by one or two compounds with just a few hotspots that include up to 20 compounds in the oxides and 10 compounds in the sulfides and selenides .",
    "the oxides map is obviously denser , reflecting the much richer chemistry of the oxides compared to the other two elements .",
    "the chemistry becomes more constrained as we proceed down the periodic table column from oxygen to sulfur and then to selenium .",
    "next , we examine maps of specific stoichiometries",
    ". maps of a few notable oxide stoichiometries and their leading structure types are shown in figure  [ fig : mendeleev_oxide_prototypes ] .",
    "these maps reflect the dominant features of the full oxide ternaries map ( figure  [ fig : fig11_mendeleev_bigger_x_upper_all_in_one ] ) , but with significant new additional gaps of absent compounds . these gaps are naturally wider for less prevalent stoichiometries , i.e. , the map of the most prevalent stoichiometry , @xmath2o@xmath4 , is denser than the three other maps in figure  [ fig : mendeleev_oxide_prototypes ] .",
    "different structure types in all stoichiometries tend to accumulate at well defined regions of the map .",
    "the separation between them is not perfect , but is similar to that exhibited by the classical pettifor maps for binary structure types @xcite .",
    "a similar picture is obtained for the sulfide and selenide structure types , figure  [ fig : mendeleev_sulfur_selenium_prototypes ] , which populate maps that are , as expected , more sparse , but show similar degree of separation between different structures .",
    "it is interesting to note that the maps of , e.g. , the ( @xmath41o , s , se ) show similar patterns in the map for oxides ( figure [ fig : mendeleev_oxide_prototypes ] ) and sulfides and selenides ( figure [ fig : mendeleev_sulfur_selenium_prototypes ] )  suggesting that similar atoms tend to form this stoichiometry in all the three elements . in the same manner ,",
    "the 2:1:1 stoichiometry shows very similar patterns in oxides , sulfides and selenides ( see figure s4 in the si ) .",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of the binary and ternary compounds of oxygen , sulfur and selenium .",
    "this analysis and the visualization tools presented here are valuable to finding trends as well as exceptions and peculiar phenomena .",
    "oxygen has a higher electronegativity ( 3.44 ) than sulfur ( 2.58 ) and selenium ( 2.55 ) , which are similar to each other .",
    "therefore , one can expect that oxygen will form compounds with a stronger ionic character .",
    "in addition , oxygen is by far more abundant than sulfur and selenium , leading to many more reported oxygen compounds .",
    "these important differences are reflected in our analysis by the significantly larger fraction of oxygen rich compounds compared to those that are sulfur or selenium rich .",
    "structure type classification also shows that there is little overlap between the oxygen structure types to sulfur or selenium structure types , while sulfur and selenium present a much higher overlap .",
    "comparison of the three different 6a elements binary and ternary compounds shows significant differences but also some similarities in unit cell size and symmetry distributions among the various bravais lattices and their corresponding space groups .",
    "in particular , the majority of structure types in all three families have a few or single compound realizations .",
    "an important observation is the existence of different gaps ( missing stoichiometries ) in the stoichiometry distribution of the oxide binary compounds compared to the sulfides and selenides .",
    "specific elements tend to present very different stoichiometry distributions , for example , silicon forms only one oxide stoichiometry ( sio@xmath3 ) while transition metals such as titanium and vanadium present 14 and 18 different stoichiometries respectively .",
    "these differences clearly reflect the different chemistry of those elements , while the large number of reported sio@xmath3 structures might reflect research bias into silicon compounds .",
    "a mendeleev analysis of the common structure types of these families shows accumulation of different structures at well defined regions of their respective maps , similar to the well - known pettifor maps of binary structure types .",
    "furthermore , at least for some of the stoichiometries , similarity of the maps for a given stoichiometry is demonstrated across all three elements .",
    "these maps should therefore prove useful for predictive purposes regarding the existence of yet unknown compounds of the corresponding structure types .",
