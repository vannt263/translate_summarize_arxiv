    "history has shown us that the study of model systems or toy models of real physical systems is the first step towards a deeper understanding of working of real physical systems@xcite . in this spirit ,",
    "asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a prototypical model of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics that deals with systems with currents flowing through them .",
    "such systems are , in general externally driven , for example , in living cells , motor proteins , traffic flows , driven diffusive systems , transport in condensed matter and mesoscopic systems etc@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to show that the above results , though boundary driven , are not a consequence of local perturbations at the boundary , we considered a variant of the model where the transverse coupling is only at the two ends .",
    "we have put @xmath1 in the all the bulk sites i.e. , for sites @xmath2 and kept finite @xmath0 for the first and the last site , _ i.e. _ , jumps from first site to second and @xmath3th site to @xmath4th happen with finite @xmath0 .",
    "we see that the system self - organizes to a state with new boundaries that control the bulk density .",
    "the actual drives ( the injection and withdrawal rates ) passively help in creating the relevant boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , we observe that the transition induced by @xmath0 for the bulk case is no longer present . the behavior of average @xmath5 with @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( a ) and the corresponding density profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) ( similar profile has benn observed in 1-d case also ) .",
    "the behaviour of average @xmath5 with very small @xmath6 shows a long living transient state , due to the very small forward motion .",
    "these observations indicate that the transition is due to a co - operative phenomenon , where bulk and boundary play their role co - operatively and inter - dependent way .",
    "in conclusion , the continuous transition from the injection rate dominated phase to the maximal current phase has been observed as a function of forward transition probability @xmath0 in a two dimensional asep ( diffusively coupled chains ) .",
    "the transition shows finite size effects , reminiscent of equilibrium phase transitions , and finite size scaling predicts exponents which are consistent with the mean field theory predictions .",
    "the bottleneck created at the boundary by the transverse coupling changes the effective particle densities at the two boundaries and the ensuing phase diagram can then be mapped out from the 1-d phase diagrams with @xmath1 , with the multicritical point shifting to @xmath7 .",
    "however no such transition can be induced if artificial bottlenecks are created at the boundaries only . in such situations ,",
    "the particles organize themselves to form a new or effective boundary density which then as per the holographic principle fixes the bulk density .",
    "this reiterates that the nonequilibrium transitions observed are cooperative but boundary driven and the boundary layers contain the information about the bulk ."
