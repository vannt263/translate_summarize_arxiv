    "the first attempts to predict the properties of antikaons in cold nuclear matter based on realistic interactions are due to waas , kaiser and weise @xcite . starting from the chiral su(3 )",
    "lagrangian the available low - energy antikaon nucleon scattering data were fitted with s - wave amplitudes obtained from a phenomenological coupled - channel approach @xcite .",
    "it was assumed that in - medium effects are dominated by pauli blocking effects which lead to a significant broadening and repulsive mass shift of the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the latter resonance couples strongly to the @xmath5 channel and is therefore of utmost relevance for the nuclear antikaon dynamics .",
    "the crucial importance of pauli blocking for the properties of the @xmath4 resonance in nuclear matter was demonstrated before by koch using another schematic model @xcite .",
    "later it was pointed out by one of the authors that the realistic treatment of the many - body effects requires a self - consistent approach : a significantly reduced antikaon mass has a strong influence on the @xmath0 mass @xcite .",
    "based on the s - wave scattering amplitudes of @xcite it was found that the @xmath0 mass is not pushed up to higher masses @xcite .",
    "this result was reproduced qualitatively by ramos and oset @xcite applying a different coupled - channel model in a partially self - consistent computation that was based on s - wave scattering exclusively .",
    "the computation @xcite relied on an angle - average approximation and therefore the results are not fully self consistent .",
    "the possible importance of p - wave interactions was pointed out in @xcite . a computation based on a phenomenological meson - exchange interaction",
    "was performed by tolos , ramos , polls and kuo @xcite using a partially self - consistent scheme that makes a quasi - particle ansatz for the antikaon spectral function .",
    "these authors found a significant influence of p - wave scattering .",
    "unfortunately it was never demonstrated whether the interaction used in @xcite is compatible with available differential scattering data .",
    "a further step towards a realistic description of antikaon propagation in nuclear matter was taken by two of the authors in @xcite .",
    "based on the chiral coupled - channel theory developed in @xcite a fully self - consistent and covariant many - body approach was established that considered s- , p- and d - wave scattering .",
    "the underlying interaction was demonstrated to be compatible with available low - energy pion- , kaon- and antikaon - nucleon differential scattering data @xcite .",
    "the computation was based on the on - shell reduction scheme developed in @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on a covariant projector algebra that considers in particular the proper mixing of partial waves in a nuclear environment .",
    "it does not lead to any artifacts like a - causal propagation if applied to the many - body system even in the presence of p- and d - wave interactions .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite differ significantly from those of tolos , ramos , polls and kuo @xcite and also from the recent works by oset and coworkers @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an on - shell factorization for s - wave scattering was assumed .",
    "it was pointed out that for p - wave interactions the on - shell factorization turns invalid in nuclear matter .",
    "an additional prescription was devised to treat the in - medium p - wave phase space .    in their previous work",
    "@xcite two of the authors demonstrated that the inclusion of p - wave scattering leads to additional and significant attraction for the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "moreover , attractive mass shifts for the p - wave and d - wave resonances @xmath1 and @xmath2 were predicted .",
    "the d - wave resonance dissolves almost completely already at saturation density .",
    "the effect of using an in - medium modified pion propagator in the pion - hyperon sub - systems was found to be of minor importance in the studies @xcite .",
    "contrasted results are claimed in @xcite .",
    "the differences may be due in part to the use of different pion spectral distributions but also different subthreshold transition amplitudes @xmath6 , which are a direct measure for the importance of pion - dressing effects . in this work",
    "we do not try to put further light on those pending discrepancies .",
    "it should be stressed that so far all realistic computations @xcite predict moderate attraction in the antikaon spectral function only .",
    "this does not appear to support the strong - attraction scenario advocated by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite . nevertheless , further improvements are desirable and possible .",
    "there are two main issues to elaborate on .",
    "first , the recent re - measurement of the @xmath7 scattering length by the dear collaboration @xcite is in conflict to some of the old bubble chamber @xmath7 low - energy scattering data @xcite .",
    "one of the authors assures that this challenge is present also in the more sophisticated approach of @xcite . at present",
    "it appears impossible , given the established coupled - channel approaches , to simultaneously describe the new accurate @xmath7 scattering length @xcite together with the low - energy scattering data . in this work",
    "we will focus on the second issue : further improve the many - body approach based on the coupled - channel theory @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to explore the effect of nuclear binding and saturation on the antikaon and hyperon properties in more detail within a self - consistent framework .",
    "this requires a significant extension of the covariant many - body approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the first work addressing this issue is due to waas , rho and weise @xcite , where it was claimed that such effects are small and unimportant .",
    "similar findings were reported in @xcite .",
    "the latter results assume an attractive mean field potential of about @xmath8 mev for the nucleon relying on a non - relativistic many - body approach . so far",
    "the possible importance of large scalar and vector nucleon mean fields has not been studied .",
    "furthermore we will investigate in this work the reliability of the angle - average approximation applied in @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2 and 3 the covariant many - body approach of @xcite",
    "is generalized for the presence of scalar and vector mean fields of the nucleons .",
    "section 4 introduces a novel renormalization scheme for the in - medium meson - baryon loop functions that avoids the occurrence of medium - induced power divergent terms as well as the occurrence of kinematical singularities .",
    "this is a crucial issue once p - wave interactions are considered .",
    "numerical results are presented in section 5 .",
    "the work closes with section 6 giving a summary and conclusions .",
    "the main findings of this work can be summarized as follows .",
    "the use of an angle - average in the evaluation of the antikaon - nucleon loop functions appears overall quite reliable , however , with some notable exceptions .",
    "the mass and width shifts for the p - wave and d - wave hyperon states can not always be accurately computed relying on the angle - average approximation .",
    "scalar and vector mean fields have a strong impact on the antikaon spectral function that becomes significantly more narrow at small momenta . it is demonstrated that the latter can not be reproduced by assuming a weak scalar mean field for the nucleon .",
    "only the combined consideration of large scalar and vector mean fields has a significant impact on the nuclear antikaon dynamics .",
    "the mean fields affect the hyperon resonances , with the exception of the @xmath2 resonance , only moderately .",
    "we consolidate our previous prediction that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances experience sizeable attractive mass shifts in cold nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath2 dissolves almost completely already at saturation density .",
    "all together only moderate attraction is predicted for the nuclear antikaon systems at saturation density . at larger densities",
    "we predict a sizable population of soft antikaon modes that arise from the coupling of the antikaon to the @xmath3 nucleon - hole state .",
    "the latter is pushed down to smaller masses significantly by a level - level repulsion of the @xmath3 nucleon - hole and antikaon mode .",
    "we speculate that this may lead to the formation of deeply bound and exotic nuclear systems with strangeness and antikaon condensation in compact stars at moderate densities .",
    "in this section we generalize the self - consistent and relativistic many - body framework established in @xcite .",
    "we will keep this work self - contained recalling crucial elements of the work @xcite .",

    "our findings may have important consequences for the physics of compact stars since antikaon condensation might occur at moderate densities already ( see e.g. @xcite ) . also finite nuclear systems with strangeness",
    "may be affected .",
    "given a finite and compressed nucleus @xmath209 our results show that the two states @xmath210 and @xmath211 interact strongly with each other by strangeness - exchange forces if large scalar and vector mean fields for the nucleon are realistic . the final @xmath210 state is pulled down to smaller energies by a significant level - level repulsion of the two states .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that deeply bound and narrow kaonic nuclei may exist as suggested by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite , however , based on a different mechanism .",
    "for instance an @xmath212 nucleus offered a strangeness quanta may further shrink in size as a consequence of the soft antikaon mode as seen in fig .",

    "in this work we generalized the self - consistent and covariant many - body approach @xcite for the presence of scalar and vector mean fields of the nucleon . based on coupled - channel interactions that were derived from the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian and that were shown to be consistent with low - energy differential scattering data @xcite we performed numerical simulations of the antikaon and hyperon spectral density in cold nuclear matter .    without",
    "scalar and vector mean fields we confirm our previous results that the consideration of p - wave scattering in addition to s - wave scattering , leads to significantly more attraction for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances .",
    "this is ascertained by an improved renormalization scheme , that avoids any in - medium induced power - divergent structures as well as the occurrence of kinematical singularities .",
    "the latter were regulated in previous works by ad - hoc cutoffs or form factors .",
    "we studied the quality of the angle - average approximation applied by oset and collaborators in their many - body approaches to antikaon and hyperon propagation properties @xcite .",
    "typically , the angle - average approximation appears sufficient to compute the antikaon spectral function reasonably well .",
    "however , the hyperon ground states and resonances are in part poorly reproduced once the angle - average approximation is assumed . this is because the p - wave and d - wave phase space of the antikaon - nucleon system is not always reproduced accurately enough .",
    "most striking is the discrepancy for the d - wave @xmath2 resonance for which a difference of about 80 mev arises .",
    "the effect of incorporating scalar and vector mean fields for the nucleon is important for the antikaon spectral function that becomes significantly more narrow at small momenta .",
    "we emphasize that it does not suffice to consider a weak scalar mean field .",
    "it is crucial to implement both , scalar and vector mean fields into the self - consistent and covariant many - body approach . since an attractive scalar but repulsive vector mean field is used the nucleon energy experiences an attractive shift at small momenta but a repulsive shift at large momenta .",
    "the repulsive effect of the mean fields on the @xmath0-mass shift as well as on the antikaon spectral function is the result of a subtle average of the two effects .",
    "the mean fields affect the hyperon resonances , with the exception of the @xmath2 resonance , only moderately .",
    "the @xmath2 dissolves almost completely already at saturation density .",
    "like all previous self - consistent approaches to antikaon and hyperon propagation properties in nuclear matter we do not substantiate the strong - attraction scenario of akaishi and yamazaki .",
    "the main antikaon mode is pulled down at saturation density by about 50 mev only . however , at larger nuclear densities we uncovered a novel phenomenon that could lead to the formation of deeply bound kaonic systems and a novel antikaon - condensation mechanism in compact stars , if large scalar and vector mean fields for the nucleon are realized in nature .",
    "for instance , at twice nuclear matter densities assuming scalar and vector mean fields of the nucleon degenerate at 500 mev in magnitude we obtained a narrow antikaon mode at 70 mev for antikaon momenta smaller than 200 mev .",
    "the latter reflects a highly collective @xmath174 nucleon - hole state that is pushed down to lower mass by interaction with the main antikaon modes .",
    "the corresponding effective @xmath174 mass at twice saturation density is 1090 mev .",
    "the precise position of the soft antikaon mode depends sensitively on the details of the dynamics .",
