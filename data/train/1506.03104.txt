    "the national football league ( nfl ) has made american football arguably the most popular sport throughout the united states . the nfl was formed in 1922 from the american professional football association , and originally consisted of 18 teams . by 1925",
    "the league began drawing tens of thousands of fans into stadiums to watch games live , and by 1934 the first nfl game between the chicago bears and the detroit lions on thanksgiving day was broadcasted live on national radio - allowing the league s fan base to spread nationally .",
    "the nfl s popularity continued to grow when the brooklyn dodgers played the philadelphia eagles was the first nfl game to be televised on the national broadcasting company(nbc ) .",
    "numerous other professional football leagues were formed to compete with the nfl during this time - although none could compete against the nfl until the all - america football conference ( afc ) , which later merged with the nfl in 1949 to further increase the size and fan base of the nfl .",
    "as the radio and television became more widespread across the united states , the nfl was able to increase their popularity as almost all nfl games were broadcasted on radio or television by 1964 , allowing professional football to overtake professional baseball in popularity around 1965 .",
    "as the years progressed , the popularity of the nfl continued to grow as television ratings surged into the millions viewers and stadiums grew to house over 100,000 fans .",
    "today , the fan base of the nfl well over 100 million people , with increasing popularity overseas @xcite .",
    "despite the popularity of the nfl , its history has been plagued by numerous scandals ; most recently , a scandal involving the footballs used by the new england patriots in the 2015 afc championship game against the indianapolis colts , which has become known as  deflategate \" . on monday",
    "january 19 , 2015 a story broke that the nfl had started an investigation into whether the new england patriots deliberately deflated the footballs they used during their afc championship win over the indianapolis colts .",
    "the nfl rules state that footballs must weigh between 14 and 15 ounces and be inflated between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch .",
    "deflated footballs would have given the patriots an advantage over the colts ( as well as other opponents ) by providing a better grip on the ball @xcite .",
    "discussion was sparked instantly on social media regarding deflategate , and grew rapidly in the hours and days after the release of the story .",
    "this scandal gained national attention quickly as the new england patriots had just earned a trip to super bowl xlix against the seattle seahawks ( another team displaying arguable ethics of its own in previous seasons @xcite ) .",
    "since the super bowl is the most anticipated game in the nfl season , attention to the story was heightened .",
    "after the super bowl was over , the scandal slowly began to dissipate and lost much of the attention it had originally had , as interest in the nfl decreased at the completion of its season.this interest continued to dissipate until early may , 2015 , when the aftermath of a 243-page report by independent attorney theodore v. wells , jr . resulted in the nfl suspending patriots star quarterback tom brady for the first four games of the 2015 season and stripping the team of two high draft picks .",
    "the sharp rise in interest in the deflategate scandal and then an initial slow dissipation of interest is similar to that of an outbreak of an infectious disease .",
    "when an infectious disease is first introduced to a new population , it can spread rapidly as a large number of the population becomes infected with the disease .",
    "the spread of the disease slows to more manageable rate as more of the population becomes immune to the disease through vaccinations or survival of victims of the disease , leaving less of the population susceptible to the disease .",
    "the infectiousness of a disease can often be captured by a dimensionless parameter called the _ basic reproduction number _ @xmath0 (  r - naught \" ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 informs scientics of how fast the disease is initially spreading by indicating the number of individuals an initial infected individual is likely to infect .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 value for the ebola virus was 2 , meaning that if one person was infected with ebola during the early stages of the epidemic , they would likely spread the virus to 2 other people before they recovered or passed away .",
    "some other @xmath0 values include 4 for the hiv and sars virus , 10 for mumps and 18 for measles @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 value of 18 is extremely high and means that measles was extremely infectious ; which is why it was so catastrophic .",
    "since the deflategate scandal spread in a way similar to an infectious disease , we can derive and use something like an @xmath0 value for this news event in order to understand how infectious this story was . to do this",
    "we must determine a useful medium through which information was spread , which we determined to be the social networking site twitter ( http://twitter.com ) .",
    "twitter allows users post _ tweets _ , a message under 160 characters , to their twitter page so that their followers , other users who will see the tweet , can read their message .",
    "the followers can then reply to the message and start a conversation with the owner of the tweet .",
    "they can also simply _ retweet _ that tweet to their followers .",
    "a retweet is when follower takes a tweet they saw and posts it onto their twitter page for their followers to see .",
    "the number of tweets and retweets about deflategate can be used to determine the @xmath0 value and the infectiousness of this scandal as a news story .    in this paper",
    "we construct a simple sir epidemic model for the infectiousness of the nfl s deflategate news story .",
    "we use standard techniques from epidemiology to derive the basic reproduction number @xmath1 for this model , as well as the average amount of time the average individual tweets about the story .",
    "we then use twitter data to estimate the parameters of this model using standard techniques from the study of inverse problems .",
    "we find that the infectiousness ( as measured by @xmath1 ) of deflategate rivals that of any infectious disease that we are aware of , and is actually more infectious than the story of hillary clinton s announcement of her presidential campaign in april , 2015 - both in terms of @xmath1 and in terms of the average amount of time the average tweeter continued to tweet about the news story .",
    "we also show that the average individual tweeted about deflategate roughly ten times more than they did about the story of freddie gray s death that elicited the baltimore riots in april of 2015 .",
    "while the punishment of the patriots in may , 2015 created its own news story regarding deflategate , we will consider only the dynamics of the initial story , occuring in january , 2015 .",
    "we assume that information concerning deflategate is spread person to person like an acute infection .",
    "since online discussion of specific topics is often measurable , we will focus on the subpopulation of media consumers that use the social media site twitter .",
    "time @xmath2 will be measured in days since the first report of deflategate on january 19th , 2015 .",
    "using formalism first studied in depth by kermack and mckendrick @xcite , and popularized by brauer and castillo - chavez @xcite , to name just two , we categorize the individuals in the twitter population as susceptible , infectious , and removed .",
    "the _ susceptible population _",
    "@xmath3 ( measured in thousands ) are those individuals that regularly read and comment on sports news but have yet to comment on deflategate as of time @xmath2 .",
    "the _ infectious population _",
    "@xmath4 ( measured in thousands ) are those that are tweeting ( or retweeting ) posts about deflategate using the keywords # deflategate , deflate gate , deflate - gate , spygate , or  deflated balls . \" as a simplifying assumption we consider each tweet as representing a unique individual ( tweeter ) , and thus tweets and individuals in the infectious class are discussed interchangably .",
    "the _ removed population _",
    "@xmath5(measured in thousands ) includes either those individuals who do not read or comment on sports ( and are hence removed from this news event even from the very beginning ) , or individuals that were once tweeting about the story and have permanently stopped using the deflategate keywords . due to the short lifespan of the story ( in the order of weeks ) , we assume that the immigration of new users , emigration of current uses , birth , and death can be neglected , yielding a constant total population size .",
    "\\(s ) at ( 0,0 ) @xmath6 ; ( i ) at ( 3,0 ) @xmath7 ; ( r ) at ( 6,0 ) @xmath8 ;    ( si ) at ( 1.5,0 ) ;    \\(s ) edge node ( i ) ( i ) edge[dashed , bend right=60 ] node[anchor = north , above ] @xmath9 ( si ) ( i ) edge node[above ] @xmath10 ( r ) ;    the progression from the susceptible population @xmath6 to the infectious population @xmath7 to the recovered ( or - maybe more appropriately named - bored ) population @xmath8 can be visualized in the traditional sir conceptual diagram ( figure [ fig : concept ] ) .",
    "the progression of the information through the population depends on many factors .",
    "one of the most prominent is the total number of  interactions \" between susceptible and infectious individuals .",
    "information about deflategate spreads when a susceptible individual comes in contact with the information spread by an infectious individual ( by reading his or her tweets ) and subsequently becomes infectious ( starts tweeting themselves ) .",
    "mathematically , a reasonable measure for the number of encounters between susceptible and an infectious individuals , assuming homogeneous mixing , is given by the product @xmath11 .",
    "this is referred to as the _ law of mass action _ in the applied mathematics literature @xcite .",
    "however , not every interaction of a susceptible person reading a tweet about deflategate will cause a retweet or a series of original tweets by the newly - infectious .",
    "we use a parameter @xmath9 , the transmission coefficient , as a daily measure of the probability that a single susceptible reader will retweet using the keywords # deflategate ,  deflate gate \" ,  deflate - gate \" ,  spygate \" ( a previous patriots scandal ) , or  deflated balls \" upon encountering such tweets in his or her feed .",
    "other functional forms exist to model the rate of new infections ( for example , the holling type ii functional form @xcite ) , which we will also explore . once infectious , we assume that individuals tweets about this story for an average of @xmath12 days .",
    "the following assumptions can be collected to create the following sir model @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are parameters giving the initial population of susceptible and infectious individuals ( measured in thousands ) .",
    "since the @xmath5 population does nt interact with the rest of the population at any given time , we can omit it from our analysis .",
    "we assume that the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 are all positive , which implies that the solution vector @xmath17^t$ ] exists and is positive for all @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the basic reproduction number @xmath0 for this sir model follows from linearizing about the  disease - free \" state @xmath19^t$ ] , where the susceptible population has yet to be exposed to the news story .",
    "@xmath0 will represent the number of susceptibles that are initially  infected \" by an individual already tweeting about the story and whether the story will spread rapidly and receive attention or will receive little attention causing the story to fall from the headlines and die off .    according to the sir model [ eq : sir ]",
    ", @xmath3 will always be a decreasing function .",
    "however for a small initial tweeting population @xmath15 , the rate of change of @xmath6 maybe small and therefore we assume @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , the equation for @xmath4 reduces to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant that is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "the solution to the linear equation ( [ eq : ireduced ] ) is @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 determines whether the function increases or decreases for small @xmath2 .",
    "the infected population will initially increase when @xmath25 . or",
    "equivalently , @xmath26 similarly the infected population will decrease if @xmath27 .",
    "this threshold is the basic reproduction number @xmath28 .",
    "one can interpret this value as the total rate of initial infections ( @xmath29 ) times the average amount of time spent infected @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath14 , diseases with large @xmath9 and/or small @xmath10 will be the the most likely diseases to result in epidemics .",
    "the size of the infected population during the days after deflategate was first reports was gleaned from an article@xcite published in boston magazine .",
    "data presented in the article was compiled by the website topsy ( http://www.topsy.com ) , an analytics company and certified twitter partner , that collects twitter data over the span of 30 days . the number of tweets per day using the keywords # deflategate ,  deflate gate \" ,  deflate - gate \" ,  spygate `` , or ' ' deflated balls \" is given by the unfilled circles in figure 2 .",
    "we used this twitter data to reverse - engineer the values of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 in the model ( [ eq : sir ] ) by using standard methods from the study of inverse problems @xcite , which we summarize below .    to employ the techniques from inverse problems we require a _ statistical model _ to go along with the mathematical model ( [ eq : sir ] ) . to create such a statistical model , we abstract our mathematical model ( [ eq : sir ] ) as in @xcite to give us @xmath31,\\\\ \\vec{x}(t_0 , \\vec{\\theta } )   & = & \\vec{x}_0 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32^t$ ] and @xmath33^t$ ] are the vectors of state variables and initial conditions of our system , given the parameter vector @xmath34^t$ ] .",
    "we define as our _ observation process _ the following @xmath35 as we are only aware of the infectious population ( i.e. the tweeters ) at any given time @xmath2 . in this case",
    "@xmath36 $ ] is a functional over @xmath37 - the case where we were able to see the entire system @xmath38^t$ ] at any given time the operator @xmath39 would be the @xmath40 identity matrix .    to find an estimate for the parameter vector @xmath41 we formulate the statistical model @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ]",
    "is considered the vector of hypothesized  true values \" of the unknown parameters and @xmath44 is a random variable that represents observation error for the observed state variable at each time @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the error function @xmath45 is such that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "since our data is collected at discrete time points , we have to write our above statistical model in discrete terms .",
    "given data @xmath50 taken at time points @xmath51 we write our observation process as @xmath52 with the discrete statistical model as @xmath53 and a realization of the discrete statistical model as @xmath54 knowing the value @xmath41 and solving the system of differential equations ( [ eq : sir ] ) with these parameter values is known as the _",
    "forward problem_. alternatively , having a set of data @xmath50 and estimating @xmath55 is known as solving an _",
    "inverse problem_. in this paper we perform the latter .",
    "while several methods exist to solve inverse problems @xcite , we will use ordinary least squares .",
    "in addition to the assumptions above , we assume that realizations of @xmath44 at particular time points are independent and identically distributed normal random variables . in this case",
    ", one can show that the parameter vector @xmath55 that maximizes the likelihood function @xmath56 is given by the parameter vector that minimizes the least - squares functional @xmath57 in other words @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the set of admissible values for the parameter vector @xmath41 .",
    "for the model in this paper @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the estimated number of monthly twitter users as of 5/14/2015 @xcite .",
    "once an estimate for parameter vector @xmath55 is found , the next question is in regards to the uncertainty in the estimate . to generate standard errors for each of the parameters we create @xmath62 _ sensitivity matrix",
    "_ @xmath63,\\ ] ] from which we create the @xmath64 convariance matrix @xmath65 it follows that the standard error in the @xmath22th component of the parameter vector @xmath55 can be approximated by the square root of the @xmath66th element of the matrix @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we report parameter values in an interval with the lower and upper bounds being two standard errors below and above the estimated value , respectively .    all programming was performed in r @xcite , with code available upon request . to solve this inverse problem we used a fourth - order runge - kutta @xcite to solve the forward problem ( [ abstract ] ) for each set of parameters @xmath41 in @xmath59 , and used",
    "the built - in optimization algorithm ",
    "optim \" in r @xcite to solve the minimization problem ( [ min ] ) for @xmath55 .",
    "for the data in figure 2 a parameter vector that minimized the value of @xmath68 is given by @xmath69^t = [ 0.0153 \\ ; \\ ; 0.3643 \\;\\ ; 156.6120 \\ ; \\ ; 2.2723]^t.\\ ] ] both and @xmath3 and @xmath4 components of the solution to ( [ eq : sir ] ) subject to these parameter values is displayed in table 1 , along with the twitter data used to solve the inverse problem .",
    "95-percent confidence intervals for the parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "since all of these confidence intervals exclude zero , we can be fairly certain that each of the parameters in the model are significantly different than zero , and thus necessary to include . while there were other parameter values that were ( local ) minimums of @xmath68 in the space @xmath59 , the fit in figure 2 suggests that @xmath55 is a reasonable estimate for the parameter vector @xmath41 .",
    "the parameter values in @xmath55 are able to give us quantitative information regarding the infectiousness of the deflategate news story .",
    "for example , the estimate for @xmath9 suggests that between 1.3 and 1.7 percent of susceptible tweeters views of deflategate tweets will result in the immediate conversion of said tweeter into someone tweeting about the deflategate story .",
    "the estimate for @xmath10 suggests that the average deflategate tweeter spends between 2.24 and 3.53 days tweeting about the deflategate story before becoming bored with the story .    since our units for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are in terms of thousands of tweeters , our value for the basic reproduction number @xmath70 actually corresponds to the average number , _ in thousands _ , of new deflategate tweeters elicited by the average initial thousand deflategate tweeters .",
    "our estimates in @xmath55 therefore suggest a basic reproduction number between 4.05 and 10.91 thousands of new deflategate tweeters per initial thousand deflategate tweeters , a number rivalling some of the aforementioned epidemics in history .",
    ".parameter values and their respective 95% confidence intervals .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    when viewing @xmath6 and @xmath7 together on the same set of axes we see that by the sixth day of the news story the entire population has either become a deflategate tweeter themselves or was never going to tweet about deflategate in the first place .",
    "on the other hand , the values of @xmath7 continue to be well above zero almost two weeks into the news story .",
    "these two pieces of information suggest that this news story - and possibly nfl news stories in general - are quite infectious and have a relatively high amount of staying power , which coincides with our initial intuition @xcite .",
    "we also explored the possibility of another functional form for the probability of an  infection \" , using the holling type ii @xcite functional form @xmath71 in place of traditional mass action @xmath72 , modeling the chance that too many susceptible individuals can cause a saturation effect in dynamics of the news story .",
    "here , @xmath73 is known as the  handling time \" in population ecology , or the amount of time it takes for the average  infection \" to occur . in the context of a news story ,",
    "this could be thought of as the amount of time it takes for an individual to realize the story was important enough to tweet about . when solving the inverse problem in this case we found that the 95 percent confidence interval for @xmath73 was equal to @xmath74 , which includes @xmath75 , suggesting that the infection medium ( social media ) is such that information transfer moves sufficiently fast so as not to require any handling time , or that this nfl story was considered ",
    "important \" roughly immediately upon the converted tweeter s read of the infectious tweet , eliciting a subsequent tweet shortly thereafter .",
    "in this paper we created , analyzed and fit a model for the infectiousness of the nfl s initial deflategate story using a standard sir epidemiological model and data from the population social networking site twitter .",
    "we found that this standard sir model fit our data quite well ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , suggesting that the assumptions inherent in using such a model are reasonable .",
    "in fact , there have been some studies ( for example , @xcite and @xcite ) suggesting that mass - action assumptions may be improperly applied in the study of actual epidemics when the underlying populations are a ) too small b ) not homogeneous in space enough to warrant such a simple transmission probability or c ) too crowded so as to saturate infectiousness when pushed beyond a certain population size .",
    "populations of twitter users , however , consist of many individuals on one webpage unimpeded physical limited , alleviating the aforementioned issues .",
    "thus , the simplest sir model may , in many ways , be a better initial model for some instances of information moving through a social networking site like twitter than it is for an epidemic moving through a real population .",
    "we used the parameters from the study of this inverse problem to determine how popular and persistent this news story was in terms of the composite parameter @xmath76 and the parameter @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we found that the average group of 1000 individuals tweeting about deflategate were able to elicit 4.05 to 10.91 thousand new tweeters to tweet about deflategate during the early stages of the news story , and that the average individual tweeting about the story tweeted between 2.24 and 3.53 about the story . to put these numbers in perspective , we ran a similar analysis of two different , prominant news stories that happened since the deflategate story : the announcement of hillary clinton s presidential campaign and the stories surrounding the baltimore riots resulting from the death of freddie gray .",
    "interestingly , the sir model used in this paper was not able to capture the behavior of either story , due to the almost immediate emergence of individuals tweeting about the story ( see figure [ fig3 ] and figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "instead of using the traditional sir model in these cases we used an sir model allowing for recruitment of new susceptibles for the clinton story and used a simple exponential model in the freddie gray case . in the former we are still able to recover @xmath0 and @xmath12 and the latter only an upper bound for @xmath12 .",
    "we found that hillary clinton s annoucement of her presidential bid , while having more total tweets at its peak than the deflategate story ( see figure 3 ) , and a similar initial infectiousness ( @xmath77 ) , had far less staying power .",
    "the average tweeter was only tweeting about mrs .",
    "clinton s annoucement for between 0.539 and 0.7133 days .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the election was still more than a year away , or that there were other candidates announcing their bids during the same period of time .",
    "be that as it may , the model for the baltimore riot story revealed something far more disturbing .",
    "this story , while eliciting far more tweets than the deflategate story , saw the average tweeter tweeting about the riots for a time whose upper bound is between only 0.3227 and 0.3232 days ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "one explanation for this short staying time would be that , after many instances of questionable police actions over the course of the past year , many people are starting to grow fatigued by such stories .",
    "however , one would hope for the same such fatigue over relatively meaningless nfl stories , which we have shown is not the case .",
    "the results in this manuscript suggest that the nfl s popularity rivals ( even surpasses ) that of what should be some of our nation s ( and world s ) biggest news stories .",
    "observations made in the wake of various news stories involving the intersection of a game ( football ) with some of our nation s most contentious issues ( gambling , equality , domestic abuse , child abuse and financial literacy , to name a few ) appear to coincide with these results ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "even noam chomsky , in an exerpt from _ the chomsky reader _ , has pondered  why americans know so much about sports but so little about world affairs \" , arguing that sports provide the easiest way for people to concentrate each other ( into fan bases ) for a common ( if inconsequential ) goal or purpose @xcite .",
    "this large - scale societal escape , he argues , is to combat the feeling shared by many that they simply do nt have much power to solve society s real problems .",
    "however , the rising popularity of the nfl , along with the societal stories and scandals that its members ( players , coaches , execs ) create , if properly leveraged , can provide society with the means to see societal change through the inevitable clash between humanity and sport .",
