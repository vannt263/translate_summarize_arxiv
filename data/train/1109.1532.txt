    "the study of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole ( bh ) has long history @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this interest is that the qnms offer a direct way of studying the key features of the physics of compact massive objects , without the complications of the full 3d general relativistic simulations .",
    "for example , by comparing the theoretically obtained gravitational qnms with the frequencies of the gravitational waves , one can confirm or refute the nature of the central engines of many astrophysical objects , since those modes differ for the different types of objects  black holes , superspinars ( naked singularities ) , neutron stars , black hole mimickers etc . @xcite .    to find the qnms",
    ", one needs to solve the second - order linear differential equations describing the linearized perturbations of the metric : the regge - wheeler equation ( rwe ) and the zerilli equation for the schwarzschild metric or the teukolsky radial equation ( tre ) for the kerr metric and to impose the appropriate boundary conditions  the so - called black hole boundary conditions ( waves going simultaneously into the horizon and into infinity)@xcite .",
    "additionally , one requires a regularity condition for the angular part of the solutions .",
    "and then , one needs to solve a connected problem with two complex spectral parameters  the frequency @xmath2 and the separation constant @xmath3 ( @xmath4  real for a nonrotating bh , with @xmath5 the angular momentum of the perturbation ) .",
    "this system was first solved by chandrasekhar & detweiler@xcite and teukolsky & press @xcite and later developed through the method of continued fractions by leaver @xcite . for more recent results ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "because of the complexity of the differential equations , until now , those equations were solved either approximately or numerically meeting an essential difficulty @xcite .",
    "the indirect approaches like the continued fractions method have some limitations and are not directly related with the physics of the problem .",
    "the rwe , the zerilli equation and tre , however , can be solved analytically in terms of confluent heun functions , as done for the first time in @xcite . imposing the boundary conditions on those solutions _",
    "directly _ ( see @xcite ) one obtains a system of spectral equations and featuring the confluent heun functions which can be solved numerically .    in this article , for the first time we present finding @xmath5 and @xmath2 _ directly _ in the case for gravitational perturbation @xmath6 in a schwarzschild metric , i.e. we solve the rwe and tre analytically in terms of confluent heun functions and we use a newly developed method ( the two - dimensional generalization of the mller method described in the internal technical report @xcite ) to solve the system of two transcendental equations with two complex variables .",
    "then we use the epsilon method to study the stability of the solutions with respect to small variations in the phase condition .",
    "the results are compared with already - published ones and are found to coincide with at least 8 digits for the rwe and 6 digits for the tre .",
    "for the first time , the so - called algebraically special mode @xmath0 is evaluated with precision of more than 6 digits , and it is shown to have a nonzero real part .",
    "this firmly refutes the hypothetical relation of this mode with the algebraically special once .",
    "also demonstrated is the nontrivial dependence on @xmath1 of the first 11 modes in both cases .",
    "the angular equation for both cases is the solution of the teukolsky angular equation when there is no rotation ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is the angle .",
    "the results for the qnms should be independent of the choice of @xmath10 in the spectral conditions . in our numerical experiments ,",
    "we use @xmath11",
    ".    the general form of the radial equations is obtained from the solutions of the rwe and tre written in terms of the confluent heun functions according to @xcite , on which the black hole boundary conditions have been imposed .",
    "the choice of the local solution in terms of the heun function takes into account the boundary condition on the horizon .",
    "then , it remains to impose the following boundary condition on the space infinity ( for details see @xcite ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the confluent heun function as defined in maple and the parameters @xmath14 differ for the two equations .",
    "the values of the parameters when the bh mass is @xmath15 and , if we choose @xmath16 which turns out to be large enough to simulate numerically the actual infinity , are ( @xcite ) :    1 .   for the solutions of the regge - wheeler equation : @xmath17 2 .   for the solutions of the teukolsky radial equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the separation constant .",
    "the parameters were obtained by solving the teukolsky radial equation and substituting @xmath20 and they are clearly different from those in the regge - wheeler case . hence , it is important to check whether both methods give the same results for qnm and with what precision .",
    "for values of the parameters @xmath21 of general type , the confluent heun function @xmath22 has branching points in the complex z - plane at the singular points @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the maple package , as a branch cut is chosen the semi - infinite interval @xmath25 on the real axis .",
    "the presence of the branch cut may lead to the disappearance of some modes or their translation , since by changing the phase of the complex variable @xmath26 , we may make a transition to another sheet of the multivalued function . to avoid this",
    ", we use the epsilon method with which one can find the correct sheet and remain on it .",
    "this is done by introducing a small variation ( @xmath27 ) in the phase condition @xmath28 ( defined by the direction of steepest descent , see @xcite ) , with which one can move the branch cuts farther from the roots and thus avoid the jump discontinuity in the function . for more information on the epsilon method and the numerical procedures ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "from the angular equation , it is clear that it can be solved explicitly without solving the system and and the values of @xmath5 are known : @xmath29 . in this paper , only the first value , @xmath30 , is used to find the qnms with both radial equations .",
    "one can then either solve only the radial equations or solve the systems and with the appropriate values of the parameters .",
    "if one solves the problem as a two - dimensional system , making calculations with 15 digits of precision ( and 32 software floating - point digits ) , one obtains as expected , @xmath31 with the first digit different from digit 9 being the 17th .",
    "the numerical results for the frequencies are summed in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".a list of the frequencies obtained for the qnms of schwarzschild black hole using the regge - wheeler equation and the teukolsky equation .",
    "the modes with @xmath32 are found for @xmath33 , modes from @xmath34  with @xmath35 .",
    "the first 5 frequencies ( @xmath36 ) were obtained also by fiziev in @xcite using exact solutions of rwe in the heun functions [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table , one can see that the frequencies from the two types of equations coincide with at least 6 digits .",
    "a comparison between the rwe frequencies and the ones published by andersson @xcite , published in @xcite shows that the difference between the two results is smaller than @xmath37 in most cases and is due to the numerical reasons .",
    "there are two important results from this study .",
    "first , as seen from table [ table1 ] for both the rwe and the tre , the mode number 8 has a small but nonzero real part .",
    "according to leaver s evaluations this mode should be equal to @xmath38 @xcite , with an exactly zero real part , if it is to correspond to the so - called _ algebraically special mode_.    algebraically special ( as ) modes have a special place in the qnm studies @xcite . the andersson method is not applicable for them and these are excluded from his consideration .",
    "berti , cardoso and starinets ( @xcite ) make a review on the results so far concerning these modes .",
    "theoretically the 9th mode ( @xmath0 ) should be purely imaginary with value @xmath39 , if it indeed corresponds to the as case . in our results , even though purely imaginary modes do not pose a problem for the method , the real part of the 9th mode is distinctly not zero , and it has at least 7 stable digits when changing @xmath1 in the interval discussed below for both rwe and tre .",
    "this clearly shows that this mode does not agree with the hypothesis for the as mode , which is to be expected since the as mode should correspond to different boundary conditions  those of the so - called totally - transmission modes ( @xcite .",
    "the second important result is the dependence of the frequencies @xmath40 on @xmath1 .",
    "the direction of steepest descent is supposed to be the optimal direction in which the solutions satisfy the black hole boundary conditions on infinity in the first term approximation for asymptotic series for the heun functions @xcite .",
    "the validity of steepest descent method in its simplest form for the radial equations in both cases under variations in this condition , however , is still an open problem studied here for the first time .    using the @xmath1 method",
    ", one can explore the intervals for @xmath1 in which each mode can be found . the results for both rwe and tre , as expected , coincide .",
    "generally , the intervals into which each mode can be found narrow down when increasing @xmath41 . while for the first 5 modes it is possible to find @xmath42 for positive and negative values of @xmath1 in a certain interval , as follows : for @xmath43 , @xmath44 $ ] , for @xmath45 $ ] , for @xmath46 $ ] , for @xmath47 $ ] , for @xmath48 $ ] , where the first sign corresponds to frequencies with a positive real part and the second sign to those with negative real parts . the imaginary parts for each mode @xmath41 coincide . ] for @xmath49 , ( but @xmath50 ) the modes with a positive real part can be found only for negative values of @xmath1 , and the dependency becomes @xmath51 .    for @xmath0",
    ", the mode has different behavior with respect to @xmath1  for @xmath52 $ ] , one finds a mode with _ negative _ real part and vice versa : ( @xmath53 ) .    the so - found relation @xmath54 needs to be examined further . for the case @xmath55 , similar ( to some extent ) behavior was mentioned also in @xcite ( and discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested that there are two as modes which are symmetrical to the imaginary axis and perhaps may be related with the branch cut in the asymptotic of the rwe potential when @xmath2 is purely imaginary . using the @xmath1 method applied on the asymptotics of the confluent heun functions , one can directly obtain the place of the branch cut on the real axis as a function of @xmath1 and they can be easily visualized plotting the solution @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the use of the confluent heun functions and the @xmath1 method offers a direct way to examine the solutions and their properties in relation to the branch cut in the complex r - plane , something that can not be readily done in the continued fractions method generally used to obtain the qnms .",
    "further exploration of the dependence @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) in the intervals mentioned above shows that , for both the rwe and the tre , it is approximately a periodic function with amplitude @xmath59 and period @xmath60 which change with @xmath41 in a nontrivial way ( fig.[fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for @xmath61 , from the rwe and the tre one obtains @xmath62 , @xmath63 and",
    "those values remain approximately constant with respect to @xmath41 ( @xmath61 ) . for @xmath64 , the dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath60 on @xmath41",
    "becomes more pronounced : the amplitudes and the periods of the rwe increase with @xmath41 until they reach @xmath65 , @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "for the tre , the amplitude and the period decrease to @xmath68 , @xmath69 . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the two periodic behaviors have approximately equal amplitudes @xmath70 .",
    "those results hint that , although the so - obtained frequencies are stable with at least 6 digits with respect to @xmath1 , there is also some finer dependence , the origin of which should be carefully investigated .",

    "in this paper , were presented the qnms for a schwarzschild bh obtained from the rwe and the tre , by solving the differential equations analytically in terms of confluent heun functions .",
    "the qnms from the tre for the case @xmath6 were calculated for the first time and were found to coincide with the well - known qnms from the rwe with precision of 6 digits .",
    "we demonstrated a new method for studying the stability of the qnm calculations .",
    "the results show nontrivial dependence on small variation in the phase condition ( the @xmath1 method ) which requires additional investigation .    for the first time , the mode @xmath0 was obtained directly from the spectral condition on the exact analytical solutions of rwe and tre and was found to have a nonzero real part , which proves that this mode is not the algebraically special mode .",
    "the mode in question is stable with 6 digits of significance with respect to changes in @xmath1 , which proves that its real part is indeed not zero .",
    "those results presented here show the strength of using confluent heun functions to find qnms of nonrotating bhs and are encouraging in continuing this work in finding qnms of rotating bhs .",
