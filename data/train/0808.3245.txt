    "the theoretical description of the physical properties of nonequilibrium correlated electron systems is an important problem in condensed matter physics . in transport processes",
    "often correlated electron systems are driven out of equilibrium by switching on external fields .",
    "the systems can be also out of equilibrium by suddenly changing their parameters .",
    "nonequilibrium correlated electron systems , which can be realized in many experiments , may have unusual and interesting properties .",
    "one such system is the quantum dot attached to two leads through two tunnel junctions.@xcite the conductance of the dot reveals a nonequilibrium kondo effect .",
    "other examples are the effects of electron correlations on the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics.@xcite recently , experiments with ultracold atomic gases have made it possible to prepare initial state to a rapid change of system parameters , and observed remarkable subsequent dynamics as a collapse and revival of the initial phase.@xcite    the many - body formalism for nonequilibrium systems was developed by many people including kubo,@xcite schwinger,@xcite kadanoff and baym,@xcite keldysh@xcite ( see also ref .   for references ) .",
    "in particular , kadanoff and baym constructed a system of equations for the nonequilibrium green functions.@xcite parallel to this development , keldysh also derived a perturbation theory for the nonequilibrium green functions.@xcite like the feynman perturbation theory for equilibrium systems,@xcite the keldysh nonequilibrium perturbation theory is based on the assumption of an adiabatic switching on of the many - body interactions . the assumption is necessary for the application of the wick theorem , which requires a quadratic form of the system hamiltonian at the initial preparation of the system .",
    "while the assumption is exactly proved in scattering theory,@xcite its application to nonequilibrium many - body systems imposes restrictions.@xcite it turns out that the assumption corresponds to the neglect of the so - called initial correlations.@xcite despite the neglect of the initial correlations the keldysh theory is widely used in the study of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "wagner unified the feynman , matsubara and keldysh perturbation theories into a single many - body formalism in which neither a special form of the hamiltonian at the initial time nor subsequent time development of the system are restricted.@xcite he introduced a matrix representation for the contour - ordered green function and derived the kadanoff - baym equations for the nonequilibrium green functions . in the kadanoff - baym - wagner formalism",
    "the initial correlations are fully taken into account . while the nonequilibrium formalism is well established ,",
    "the role of the initial correlations is less attended , especially for nonequilibrium strongly correlated electron systems . in particular",
    ", it would be desirable to test whether the initial correlations which are neglected in the keldysh formalism are negligible or not .",
    "the difficulties arising in the study of the initial correlations are mostly due to the lack of getting the exact solutions of nonequilibrium correlated electron systems .    in the last decade ,",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) was developed.@xcite in the equilibrium case the theory is widely and successfully applied to study strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the dmft gives the exact solutions in infinite dimensions .",
    "recently , a version of the dmft for nonequilibrium systems was developed.@xcite the nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory ( nedmft ) is formally formulated on the same basis as of the equilibrium dmft . like the equilibrium case",
    ", in infinite dimensions the self energy of nonequilibrium systems becomes a local function in space . as a consequence",
    ", it can be self - consistently determined by mapping the lattice problem onto an effective problem of a single site embedded in a self - consistent effective medium . when the self - consistent equations are solved , the nonequilibrium green functions are obtained and various physical quantities can be calculated .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we study the contributions of the initial correlations in a nonequilibrium correlated electron system .",
    "the initial correlations are studied within truncated and self - consistent perturbation theories as well as within the nedmft .",
    "the keldysh perturbation theory usually argues for the neglect of the initial correlations .",
    "however , in the present paper the results obtained within the truncated and self - consistent perturbation theories show that the initial correlations are always finite even when the initial time is in the remote past limit . in the infinite dimension",
    "limit the initial correlations can also be obtained exactly since in this limit the nedmft gives the exact solutions . in the such way one can find under what circumstance the keldysh formalism is safely applied to nonequilibrium correlated electron systems .",
    "the second aim of the present paper is to derive the kadanoff - baym - wagner equations for the nonequilibrium green functions within the nedmft .",
    "these equations are an alternative to the original nedmft equations for the contour - ordered green function.@xcite within the kadanoff - baym - wagner formalism the nonequilibrium green functions clearly satisfy their boundary conditions .",
    "the kadanoff - baym - wagner formalism already includes the keldysh formalism as its part , and it is suitable to study the initial correlations . in this paper",
    "we will examine the initial correlations within a keldysh boundary problem .",
    "the problem works in a system which is first started in equilibrium and then is driven out of equilibrium by turning on of an external field .",
    "the model which we adopt to describe the system is a nonequilibrium falicov - kimball model .",
    "the falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) was first introduced for modelling a metal - insulator transition in equilibrium.@xcite the model is one of the simplest models for strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the fkm describes conduction electrons interacting via a repulsive contact potential with localized electrons .",
    "it can be viewed as a simplified hubbard model where electrons with down spin are frozen and do not hop .",
    "much progress has been made on solving this model in both exact and approximation ways , where all properties of the conduction electrons in equilibrium are well known.@xcite in equilibrium the fkm describes a metal - insulator transition for the homogeneous phase.@xcite the coulomb interaction is divided into two ranges : the weak interaction range , when the interaction strength is smaller than the half bare bandwidth , and strong interaction one otherwise . for weak interactions",
    "the system is metallic , and for strong ones the system is insulator . the system is driven out of equilibrium by a constant electric field . the electric field is switched on at a some time after the initial preparation of the system in equilibrium .",
    "this nonequilibrium fkm was introduced by freericks _",
    "et al _ in the study of the bloch oscillations in the electric current within the nedmft.@xcite in the present paper we derive the kadanoff - baym - wagner equations of the nedmft for the nonequilibrium fkm , and calculate the contributions of the initial correlations to the electric current and the double occupation .",
    "it is found that the contributions of the initial correlations to the electric current and the double occupation are small in relation to the full value of those physical quantities in the weak interaction case , and significantly increases in the strong interaction case .",
    "however , without the initial correlations the system can not restore full electron correlations even before the turning on of the electric field .",
    "the neglect of the initial correlations may cause artifacts in the nonequilibrium properties of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the kadanoff - baym - wagner nonequilibrium formalism , and describe the nonequilibrium fkm . in the next three sections we present the studies of the model within the truncated and self - consistent perturbation theories , and the nedmft .",
    "the last section is the conclusion .",
    "we consider the keldysh boundary problem in a nonequilibrium system which is first prepared in equilibrium , and then is driven out of equilibrium by switching on of an external field or by a sudden change of its parameters .",
    "specifically , at an initial time @xmath0 the system is prepared in equilibrium which is defined by the equilibrium hamiltonian @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 , and at time @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) an external field is switched on or its parameters are suddenly changed . usually , in nonequilibrium systems the time translational invariance is not valid , and the green functions , which are employed for studying the physical properties of the systems , depend on the two time variables . the nonequilibrium formalism works with the so - called contour - ordered green function which is defined for the time variables on the kadanoff - baym contour.@xcite the kadanoff - baym contour",
    "is shown on fig .",
    "the contour starts in the initial time @xmath0 , runs out to maximal time @xmath5 , then returns to the initial time , and finally moves parallel to the negative imaginary axis a distance @xmath6 . at the initial time @xmath0",
    "the system is always in equilibrium .",
    "the kadanoff - baym contour is suitable for deriving the dyson equation for the contour - ordered green function .",
    "keldysh also introduced a similar contour for the contour - ordered green function.@xcite the keldysh contour is basically the same as the kadanoff - baym contour , but it neglects the last contour branch parallel to the imaginary axis and limits @xmath0 to minus infinity .",
    "the neglect of the last branch of the contour corresponds to the neglect of initial correlations .",
    "the contour - ordered green function is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for electrons at site @xmath10 .",
    "the time evolution of the operators on the kadanoff - baym contour is defined in the heisenberg picture .",
    "@xmath11 is the time ordering on the kadanoff - baym contour and it is defined via the contour step function @xmath12 .",

    "the kadanoff - baym contour consists of three time branches : the first branch is chronological , the second one is antichronological , and the last one is parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "thus , we can represent the contour - ordered green function by a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 , where @xmath14 locates on the @xmath19-th branch , and @xmath15 locates on the @xmath20-th branch . in the such way ,",
    "the contour - ordered green function has nine component green functions , however they are not independent .",
    "wagner reduced the matrix representation of the contour - ordered green function to a matrix form of six component green functions , and five of them are independent.@xcite the wagner matrix representation for the contour - ordered green function can be written as follows@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22\\big\\rangle , \\\\ g^{m}(\\tau,\\tau ' ) & = & g^{33}(t_0-i\\tau , t_0-i\\tau ' ) \\\\ & = & -i \\big\\langle   \\mathcal{t}_{\\tau } c_i(t_0-i\\tau ) c^{\\dagger}_j(t_0-i\\tau ' ) \\big\\rangle , \\\\ g^{\\rceil}(t,\\tau ' ) & = & g^{13}(t , t_0-i\\tau ' ) \\\\ & = & i \\big\\langle c^{\\dagger}_j(t_0-i\\tau ' ) c_i(t )   \\big\\rangle , \\\\ g^{\\lceil}(\\tau , t ' ) & = & g^{31}(t_0-i\\tau , t ' ) \\\\ & = & - i \\big\\langle c_i(t_0-i\\tau ) c^{\\dagger}_j(t ' ) \\big\\rangle , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are real times , and @xmath25 . in the above equations",
