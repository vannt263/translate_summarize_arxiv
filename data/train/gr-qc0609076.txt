    "recent observations suggest that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this acceleration may be explained by the assumption that @xmath1 of the universe is filled by a perfect fluid with negative pressure , dubbed dark energy .",
    "some present data seem to favor an evolving dark energy , corresponding to an equation of state ( eos ) parameter less than @xmath0 at present epoch from @xmath2 in the near past @xcite .",
    "many candidates for dark energy has been proposed such as the cosmological constant @xcite : a constant quantum vacuum energy density which fills the space homogeneously , corresponding to a fluid with a constant eos parameter @xmath0 ; dynamical fields with a suitably chosen potential to make the vacuum energy vary with time @xcite , and so on .",
    "recently , using holographic principle , a new candidate for dark energy which is independent of any specific field has been suggested @xcite,@xcite .",
    "based on the holographic principle ( which relates the number of degrees of freedom of a physical system to the area of its boundary ) , in order to allow the formation of black holes in local quantum field theory , cohen et al @xcite proposed a relationship between uv and ir cutoff .",
    "this yields an upper bound on the zero - point energy density , which by a suitable choice of the infrared cutoff , can be viewed as the holographic dark energy density . in @xcite ,",
    "three candidates for the infrared cutoff was proposed : the hubble radius , the particle horizon and the future event horizon .",
    "there was shown that among these options only the future event horizon may be identified with the desired infrared cutoff . to study the coincidence problem and also to have other choices for the infrared cutoff , e.g. the hubble radius , interaction between dark matter and dark energy @xcite",
    "may be considered in the holographic dark energy model .",
    "as we have mentioned , based on astrophysical data , we may take into account the possibility of @xmath0 ( phantom divide line ) crossing .",
    "therefore dark energy models which can describe phantom divide line crossing , has been also studied vastly in the literature @xcite .",
    "the phantom like behavior of interacting holographic dark energy was studied in @xcite , where it was claimed that by selecting appropriate interaction parameters the transition from the dark energy eos parameter @xmath3 to @xmath4 is possible . despite this , in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the dark energy effective eos parameter can not cross @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we consider interacting holographic dark energy model and study the ability of the model to describe the transition from quintessence to phantom regime and vice versa .",
    "after preliminaries in section two , where we introduce the interacting holographic dark energy model and some of its general properties used in the subsequent sections , in section three we study the possibility of crossing @xmath0 . in section four",
    "we derive necessary conditions for existence of two transitions in our model .",
    "the first transition is from quintessence to phantom phase and the second the transition from phantom to quintessence regime .",
    "the importance of the second transition lies on the fact that it avoids the big rip singularity .",
    "we discuss also the behavior of hubble parameter and dark energy density at transitions times .",
    "we use @xmath6 units throughout the paper .",
    "we consider a spatially flat friedmann  lemaitre  robertson  walker ( frw ) universe ) , with scale factor @xmath7 @xmath8 we assume that this universe is filled with dark energy and pressureless dark matter fluids satisfying the following equations of state @xmath9 @xmath10 is the hubble parameter , @xmath11 is dark energy density and @xmath12 is the density of cold dark matter .",
    "`` dot '' denotes derivative with respect to the comoving time .",
    "@xmath13 is dark energy eos parameter .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the interaction of dark matter with dark energy . in this paper @xmath14",
    "is assumed to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two real constants .",
    "different choices such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 has been adopted in literature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the hubble parameter satisfies @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 is the total energy density satisfying @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the parameter of the eos of the universe . in terms of @xmath26 , we can write @xmath27 @xmath11 can be viewed as a holographic energy density @xmath28 the length scale @xmath29 is an infrared cutoff and @xmath30 is a positive numerical constant .",
    "we assume @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the future and particle event horizons @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two positive numerical constants . by taking @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we arrive at the holographic cosmology horizon adopted in @xcite . for @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "the infrared cutoff becomes the future event horizon @xcite .",
    "generally one can assume that @xmath29 is a function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath29 is obtained as @xmath41 using ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , @xmath42 in the above equation can be written as @xmath43 by relating the entropy of the universe to the infrared cutoff @xmath29 via @xmath44 the second law of thermodynamics results in @xmath45 , leading to @xmath46 . in a phantom dominated universe ( identified by @xmath47 ) , using ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) we get @xmath48    for @xmath49 we must have @xmath50 which leads to @xmath51 .",
    "but if one requires @xmath52 , then either @xmath53 or @xmath54 becomes positive after a finite time .    in terms of the hubble parameter",
    ", @xmath25 is @xmath55 by substituting @xmath56 ( which can be verified using ( [ 11 ] ) ) , ( [ 15 ] ) becomes @xmath57 using ( [ 2 ] ) one can show that @xmath58,\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , by considering @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61 and consequently @xmath62 from ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) we can express @xmath25 and @xmath63 in terms of @xmath64 : @xmath65 @xmath66 for an accelerated universe , @xmath67 ( which results in @xmath68 ) , we have @xmath69 in the absence of interaction , acceleration is not possible for @xmath70 , as was pointed out by @xcite for the case @xmath71 .",
    "this was the motivation of @xcite to take the future event horizon ( instead of the particle horizon ) as the infrared cutoff .",
    "however the above calculation reveals that in the presence of interaction , inflation may be possible even when the particle horizon is taken as the infrared cutoff . combining ( [ 21 ] ) and",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , yields @xmath72 hence like the phantom regime , for @xmath70 and in an accelerating universe , @xmath64 is decreasing . applying the assumption @xmath45 ,",
    "gives an upper bound for @xmath64 which depends only on @xmath73 @xmath74",
    "at @xmath0 , @xmath75 satisfies the cubic equation @xmath76 if @xmath0 is allowed , the above equation must have , at least , one positive root which is less than one . based on descartes",
    "rule , we know that the above equation , at most , has two real positive roots",
    ". so , if @xmath0 is crossed , two transitions may be possible , one from quintessence to phantom and the other from phantom to quintessence phase ( by quintessence phase ( regime ) we mean @xmath68 and @xmath77 ) . from ( [ 15 ] ) it is clear that at @xmath0 we have @xmath78 .",
    "if a transition from quintessence to phantom phase occurs at time @xmath79 , we must have @xmath80 , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 , therefore @xmath83 must be a local minimum of @xmath73 . in the same way , @xmath73 must have a local maximum at @xmath84 , where the transition from phantom to quintessence era occurs . in the neighborhood of @xmath79 , @xmath25 is a decreasing function while in the neighborhood of @xmath84 , @xmath25 is an increasing function of time . so in order to see that if @xmath0 crossing is permissible , we must also consider the behavior of the hubble parameter near the roots of ( [ 25 ] ) .    in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we also assume that the hubble parameter is a differentiable function of time @xcite . therefore following ( [ 11 ] ) and",
    "( [ 12 ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath87 are also differentiable .",
    "let us consider the taylor expansion of @xmath73 at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is defined by @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the order of the first nonzero derivative of @xmath73 at @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath95 is an even integer and @xmath96 , then @xmath73 has a minimum ( maximum ) at @xmath89 and the transition occurs at @xmath89 . using ( [ 15 ] ) we obtain @xmath97 we consider the following expansion for @xmath98 at @xmath88 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the order of the first nonzero derivative of @xmath98 at @xmath89 .",
    "if the solution ( [ 26 ] ) is permissible , by inserting ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) in ( [ 20 ] ) and by comparing the powers of @xmath101 in both sides of ( [ 20 ] ) , we obtain the following results : @xmath102 the roots of this equation specify @xmath98 at transition time(s ) . in order that the transition occurs the above equation must have at least one real root in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "( ii)for @xmath104 we obtain @xmath105 in the case @xmath106 and for @xmath107 , we find @xmath108 in this case @xmath95 is an odd number and transition does not occur . if @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath25 in ( [ 20 ] ) , becomes a constant : @xmath111 , and no transition occurs .    to determine @xmath95 and the sign of @xmath112 , ( [ 21 ] )",
    "may be used : @xmath113.\\ ] ] by inserting ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) into the above equation , we see that the left hand side begins with @xmath114 , while if the right hand side does not begin with @xmath115 , it will begin by @xmath116 , which is inconsistent with the left hand side .",
    "thereby @xmath117 .",
    "hence based on ( [ 31 ] ) and our previous discussion after ( [ 26 ] ) , if the transition occurs , we must have @xmath118 .",
    "note that for the case ( [ 32 ] ) , we obtain @xmath119 which may be corresponding to the inflection point of @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath117 , by equalizing @xmath115 s coefficients in both sides of ( [ 34 ] ) , we get @xmath120,\\ ] ] which using ( [ 29 ] ) reduces to @xmath121.\\ ] ] now let us determine the sign of @xmath112 . combining ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) results in @xmath122 from ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) , by applying the thermodynamics second law we deduce @xmath123 which results in @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 is ruled out because @xmath126 .",
    "so we conclude that the sign of @xmath112 must be the same as the sign of @xmath127 . for transition from quintessence to phantom phase",
    "we must have @xmath128 while a transition from phantom to quintessence era requires @xmath129 note that if , like @xcite , we take @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath130 , transition from quintessence to phantom is not allowed .",
    "it is also instructive to study the behavior of @xmath29 at @xmath89 .",
    "assuming that @xmath45 , by inserting the taylor expansion of @xmath29 at @xmath88 up to the order @xmath131 in ( [ 11 ] ) , we obtain @xmath132[h_0+h_1\\tau^a+o(\\tau^{(a+1)})]+\\alpha-\\beta$ ] , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 . hence @xmath135 .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) results in @xmath136 , therefore @xmath137 which is consistent with ( [ 36 ] ) .    as a summary",
    "we have shown that in order that a transition phase occurs : ( i ) ( [ 29 ] ) must have at least a positive real root in the interval ( 0,1 ) ( ii ) at these roots the hubble parameter ( if it is differentiable ) must have the taylor expansion ( [ 26 ] ) , with an even integer @xmath95 . in interacting holographic dark energy model",
    "we obtained @xmath118 and verified that quintessence to phantom phase transition and vice versa occur provided ( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) hold respectively .",
    "in this part we try to investigate the ability of the system to return to the quintessence regime from the phantom phase",
    ". this may be interesting because it avoids the big rip singularity which may be encountered in phantom models .",
    "let us write ( [ 29 ] ) as @xmath138 where @xmath139 in order to have two transitions , ( [ 42 ] ) , must possess two real positive roots , which we denote by @xmath140 , @xmath141 , in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath142 and @xmath143 are real numbers , hence the third root must be also real .",
    "therefore the discriminant of ( [ 42 ] ) , i.e. @xmath144 , must be positive @xmath145 from @xmath146 , we find that the third root , @xmath147 , is negative and @xmath148 .",
    "so using @xmath149 , we deduce @xmath150 . also following descartes rule of sign , having two positive roots",
    "is only possible when @xmath151 and @xmath152 .    the sturm sequence constructed from ( [ 42 ] ) is @xmath153 , where @xmath154 we have @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "if we expect to have two real roots in the interval @xmath103 , using ( [ 44 ] ) and by applying the sturm theorem , we find @xmath157 these conditions and ( [ 44 ] ) , may be resumed as @xmath158    now let us consider ( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) . a transition from quintessence to phantom phase",
    "may be occurred at @xmath79 ( @xmath159 ) , if @xmath160 @xmath161 for @xmath162 the system becomes phantom dominated until @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) , i.e. when the second transition occurs , provided @xmath165 at @xmath84 @xmath166 from ( [ 14 ] ) we find that @xmath98 is a decreasing function of time in phantom dominated era , hence @xmath167 . so in order that ( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) become consistent we must have @xmath168    the existence of @xmath140 and @xmath141 which satisfy ( [ 48 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) , may be verified as follows : using the condition posed on @xmath142 and @xmath143 , we obtain @xmath169 the sturm sequence at @xmath170 is @xmath171 so by invoking the sturm theorem , one can verify that one of the positive roots , which based on our discussion in previous paragraph we take @xmath141 , is located in @xmath172 while the other , i.e. @xmath140 belongs to @xmath173 . as we have previously mentioned",
    "( see discussion after ( [ 25 ] ) ) , @xmath25 is a decreasing function of time in the neighborhood of @xmath140 and an increasing function of time in the vicinity of @xmath141 , whence for a differentiable @xmath25 , we must have @xmath174 at a point in the phantom regime .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath175 , this happens at @xmath176 , as it can be verified using ( [ 20 ] ) . indeed from ( [ 20 ] ) , it is obvious that @xmath177 has three solutions : @xmath176 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 . in our case , @xmath178 is ruled out by ( [ 23 ] ) . the solution @xmath176 , as we have seen lies in the phantom regime .",
    "the solution @xmath179 , must be obtained in the limit @xmath180 in the quintessence era ( by the assumption that the inflation will be continued ) .",
    "to verify this claim , we note that in an accelerating universe @xmath181 , and for @xmath182 , @xmath183 therefore @xmath42 is an analytic differentiable increasing function of time .",

    "@xmath174 occurs in the phantom regime : @xmath203 , and at @xmath179 .",
    "in this paper we considered the holographic dark energy model with a general interaction between dark matter and dark energy , see ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we took the infrared cutoff as a linear combination of the future an particle horizon see ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "we derived an expression for eos parameter of the universe , @xmath25 , in terms of the ratio of dark energy density and total energy density of the flat frw space - time , @xmath64 , see ( [ 20 ] ) . using ( [ 20 ] ) and the expression obtained for time derivative of @xmath64 ( [ 21 ] ) , and by assumption that the thermodynamics second law is still valid , we studied the possibility ( and necessary conditions ) for quintessence to phantom phase transition and vice versa with a differentiable hubble parameter .",
