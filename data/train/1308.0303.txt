    ", a triaxial nucleus can rotate about an axis that does not coincide with the principal axis ( pa ) @xcite .",
    "the evidence for such rotations has been very limited , however , mainly owing to very indirect experimental information concerning triaxial shapes .",
    "theoretical challenges include ( i ) the fact that very few nuclei are predicted to be triaxial in their ground states @xcite , and predictions are very model dependent @xcite ; ( ii ) triaxial minima in potential - energy surfaces associated with triaxial shapes are soft , and ( iii ) minima of routhians in function of the tilting angles are shallow  @xcite , meaning the rotational axis can easily change its direction .",
    "the latter two challenges require the mean - field models to be able to handle various correlations in a self - consistent manner .    in self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) tac calculations , when the rotational axis moves away from the pa , the nucleus has to stay fixed in the pa system .",
    "this can be realized by adding linear constraints that would guarantee that the resulting off - diagonal components of the inertia tensor vanish . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "kerman and onishi have shown that the corresponding lagrange multipliers depend on the angular momentum , rotational frequency , and the quadrupole moments of the system through relation(3.6 ) in ref.@xcite , referred to as the kerman - onishi ( ko ) conditions in the following .",

    "we extend these studies to mean - field approaches based on realistic energy density functionals ( edfs ) .",
    "recently , a multitude of high - spin bands in nuclei around @xmath5er have been observed@xcite and interpreted in terms of triaxial strongly deformed ( tsd ) structures predicted by the pa cranking ( pac ) calculations@xcite .",

    "@xcite , we have demonstrated that by allowing the rotational axis to tilt away from the pa , one of these minima becomes a saddle point , thus clarifying the nature of the tsd1 and tsd2 bands . in our fully self - consistent tac skyrme - hf ( shf ) and hf - bogoliubov ( shfb ) calculations",
    ", we noticed that the ko conditions , which in the past have never been practically implemented in the edf approaches , are numerically fulfilled with high precision .",
    "here , we provide an in - depth analysis of these conditions and discuss their physical consequences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[ko - cond ] , we present a re - derivation of the ko conditions and extend it to the framework of the kohn - sham ( ks ) theory , where one does not employ hamiltonian but an edf .",

    "the conditions for a general nuclear rotation around arbitrary axis were proposed by kerman and onishi @xcite within the time - dependent variational method . in the following subsection , to fix the notation , we recall the original derivation that is based on the constrained hf method .      within the constrained hf method , the rotation is imposed by adding a cranking term , @xmath9 to the hamiltonian @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angular momentum operator and @xmath0 are three lagrange multipliers identified with the rotational frequency vector .",
    "the intrinsic frame is defined by bringing the average values of the symmetric second - rank tensor , @xmath12 to its pa .",
    "this can be achieved by requiring that the average values of three off - diagonal components of @xmath13 : @xmath14 are zero in the hf state @xmath15 : @xmath16    the resulting routhian can be written as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are three lagrange multipliers enforcing condition ( [ bcond ] ) , and the rotational frequencies @xmath0 are determined from the angular - momentum condition : @xmath19 the original derivation of ko conditions is based on the fact that for the stationary hf state @xmath15 that minimizes the routhian @xmath20 the following condition holds : @xmath21|\\phi\\rangle=0.\\ ] ]    by assuming the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian : @xmath22=0,\\ ] ] denoting the three diagonal components of ( [ qtens ] ) as @xmath23 , and noticing that @xmath24 } & =   -i\\hat{b}_k , \\\\ [ \\hat{b}_k,\\hat{j}_k ] & =   i(\\hat{d}_i   - \\hat{d}_j ) , \\end{aligned } \\qquad ( ijk ; \\textrm{cyclic})\\ ] ] one arrives at the original ko conditions : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , nonzero values of lagrange multipliers @xmath18 imply that vectors @xmath0 and @xmath2 are not parallel .",
    "we note here that @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are numbered by three cartesian directions and thus we use for them the standard bold - face notations @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively ; however , under space rotations they do not transform as vectors .      in the framework of the ks approach of the dft @xcite , the basic entity is the energy density @xmath33 , which gives the total binding energy of the system in terms of the one - body density matrix @xmath34 : @xmath35 expressed in terms of kinetic and potential energy terms .",
    "the minimization of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath34 under conditions ( [ bcond ] ) and ( [ jcond ] ) results in self - consistent ks equations : @xmath37=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath39 is now given by the functional derivative of @xmath36 : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the one - body kinetic term and @xmath42  one - body potential - energy term .",
    "it is important to realize that in the ks approach , neither many - body hamiltonian @xmath43 nor wave function @xmath15 are well - defined entities , unless the energy density @xmath44 is explicitly derived from an effective two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , even if the actual approach is based on a hamiltonian , the self - consistent density @xmath34 and the potential term @xmath45 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ kseq ] ) usually break the original symmetries of @xmath43 ( in particular the rotational invariance ) due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath43 depends on density , as in the case of skyrme and gogny interactions , condition ( [ hinv ] ) obviously does not hold .",
    "let us now consider the group so(3 ) of rotations .",
    "the corresponding transformation is represented by the unitary operator @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a three - dimensional rotation vector . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , since the energy density is covariant with @xmath48 , that is , @xmath49 and the kinetic term is a scalar , the potential energy is invariant with respect to a unitary transformation of the density @xcite @xmath50 as a matter of fact , relation ( [ potinv ] ) applies not only to the total potential energy but also to individual contributions to @xmath51 associated with terms characterized by different coupling constants .",
    "physically , eq .  ( [ potinv ] ) simply means that the total energy does not depend on the orientation of the intrinsic density in space .    the first - order expansion in @xmath47 yields @xcite @xmath52).\\ ] ]",

    "the extension to superfluid dft , or self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory is straightforward : in the derivations above , the single - particle density matrix @xmath34 is replaced by the generalized 2@xmath592 density matrix @xmath60 , also involving the abnormal ( pair ) density @xmath61 @xcite , and the mean - field @xmath39 is replaced by the 2@xmath592 hfb hamiltonian , containing the pairing field @xmath62 .",
    "all other steps are identical ; one needs to remember that the one - body operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 act only in the particle - hole space , that is , the average values do not involve the abnormal density .",
    "in this work , all calculations were performed by using the symmetry - unrestricted solver hfodd ( version 2.49t)@xcite . for tests of ko conditions in @xmath5er and tac calculations of tsd bands in @xmath3yb",
    ", we performed the shf calculation without pairing .",
    "we used the skyrme edf skm*@xcite and 1,000 deformed harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis states with ho frequencies of @xmath65mev ( up to @xmath66 ho quanta ) and @xmath67mev ( up to @xmath68 ho quanta ) .",
    "detailed tests show that such a size of the basis provides us with a sufficient precision for the quantities studied in this work .",
    "tests of the ko conditions in @xmath5er were performed at rotational frequency of @xmath69mev and for configuration denoted by @xmath70 \\otimes \\pi[17,18,16,17]$ ] .",
    "the configurations are labeled by the numbers of states occupied in the four parity - signature ( @xmath71 ) blocks , in the convention of ref.@xcite .",
    "technically , these numbers correspond to the conserved @xmath72-signature , and thus are valid only for rotations around the @xmath72 axis . however , for a two - dimensional cranking tilted within a symmetry plane of the matter distribution , the @xmath2-signature corresponding to the direction of the angular - momentum vector remains a good quantum number for any tilting angle @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the given numbers of states can be understood as pertaining to the @xmath2-signature .",
    "of course , for non - zero tilting angles , the code must be run in the broken-@xmath72-signature mode , whereupon the configurations are set by fixing numbers of states occupied in parity blocks only .    to check the ko conditions in the presence of pairing",
    ", we also performed tac hfb calculations for @xmath74mo , with lipkin - nogami pairing ( hfb+ln ) included@xcite .",
    "the neutron and proton pairing strengths were chosen as @xmath75mev , with a cutoff energy in the quasiparticle spectrum of @xmath76mev .",
    "this choice of the specific nucleus and pairing strengths was dictated by the fact that with this choice one obtains a well defined triaxial solution with sizable pairing , which makes it a very suitable test case for the ko conditions in hfb .    to link eq.([eqn3 ] ) to total quadrupole moments of the nucleus , we first rewrite it terms of spherical components of the quadrupole tensor ( [ qtens ] ) . in the hfodd convention for multipole moments , we have : @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the standard spherical harmonics in the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite and normalization factors @xmath79 have been defined in table 5 of ref .",
    "then we have explicitly ,    @xmath80    with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and thus , @xmath83    by means of eqs.([convention1])-([convention6 ] ) , the ko conditions ( [ eqn3 ] ) read :    @xmath84    which can be conveniently written in terms of factors @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , in the calculations presented in this study we only allow the rotational axis to tilt from the @xmath72-axis into the @xmath88-@xmath72 plane ; that is , the cranking is two dimensional . in this case , only one of the three constraints , @xmath89 , is active .",
    "the other two constraints , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , are automatically realized by enforcing the @xmath92-@xmath93-simplex symmetry  @xcite .",
    "then , in each iteration , @xmath94 is updated so as to guarantee that @xmath95 . to obtain a precise value of this constraint , we use the augmented lagrange method  @xcite . upon convergence ,",
    "one obtains values of @xmath94 , components of total angular momentum , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . inserting @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 into relation  ( [ eqn4 ] ) , one obtains values of @xmath99 . by comparing @xmath94 and @xmath87",

    "we can thus see that in our hf and hfb calculations the ko conditions are fulfilled with a rather high precision .",
    "we note that at @xmath101 or 90@xmath102 , the solutions correspond to the uniform pa rotation , and thus the values of both @xmath94 and @xmath87 tend to zero ; hence , the ratios @xmath100 can not be determined .",

    "we see that in the shf case the convergence of the ratio to the exact value of @xmath107 can be slow . because of that , by stopping the iteration when the convergence at every @xmath73 reaches a fixed stability , one obtains values of @xmath100 that differ from one by small residuals that vary from point to point .     as a function of iteration number at @xmath106 for shf , shfb+ln , and shfb ( no cut - off ) .",

    "the ratios of @xmath100 rapidly converge , but the obtained limit systematically deviates from one by a small number @xmath1080.0006 .",
    "it turns out that this result can be attributed to the truncation of the quasiparticle spectrum , which is routinely employed in the hfb calculations when dealing with zero - range pairing interactions .",
    "indeed , such truncation makes the pairing tensor acquire a small symmetric part , which is bosonic in character@xcite .",
    "when we switch off the ln procedure and increase the cutoff energy @xmath109 in such a way that the variational method is rigorously valid and all quasiparticles are included , values of @xmath100 converge perfectly to one as one can assess from fig .",

    "a good indicator of unstable pac solutions is the appearance of competing pac minima with similar values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 but opposite values of @xmath8 , as discussed in sec .",

    "therefore , before computing the routhians as functions of the tilting angle , we first performed extensive pac calculations so as to determine deformations of various minima .",
    "similar to the pac calculations in @xmath5er@xcite , we found that the configurations generally have three typical deformations , namely , @xmath110@xmath111 ( tsd1 ) , @xmath112@xmath113 ( tsd2 ) , and @xmath114@xmath115 ( tsd3 ) .",

    "interestingly , for the configuration a , a minimum at @xmath119 0 or 90@xmath102 develops .",
    "in such a situation , one may expect the large - amplitude collective motion of the rotational axis along @xmath73 .",

    "in this study we re - examined the kerman - onishi conditions for a triaxial quantum rotation within the self - consistent kohn - sham theory .",
    "we first derived the ko equations without invoking the concept of hamiltonian or wave function but rather in terms of energy density functional and nucleonic densities .",
    "not surprisingly , the final form of the ko condition ( [ eqn3 ] ) is the same as that originally derived for the hf approximation .    in the next step",
    ", we performed numerical tests of the ko condition within the shf and shfb+ln methods . for the first time , these relations have been tested in a fully self - consistent edf approach , including pairing . by comparing the self - consistently obtained lagrange multiplier @xmath94 with the value @xmath87 given by eq.([eqn3 ] ) , we demonstrated that in our tac calculations , the ko conditions are fulfilled to a very high precision .",
    "we noticed that when differences between @xmath94 and @xmath87 occur , those are excellent indicators of the variational principle violations due to practical approximations ( such as , e.g. , the quasiparticle basis truncation in hfb ) .    finally , we performed 2d tac calculations for the low - lying tsd bands in @xmath3yb . at lower frequencies ,",
    "we predict rather @xmath73-soft routhian curves , indicative of the large - amplitude collective motion . with increasing rotational frequency , tsd1 configurations become favored energetically and tsd2 represent unphysical saddle points .",
    "tsd3 configurations become lower in energy than those of tsd1 and tsd2 configurations already at @xmath121mev , which is much lower than what has been predicted for @xmath5er .",
    "a detailed analysis of tsd bands in @xmath3yb will be published elsewhere .    in summary , over thirty years ago , kinematic conditions for a quantum rotation of triaxial nuclei were derived within the self - consistent theory .",
    "now , for the first time , we have performed edf calculations that strictly obey those conditions .",
    "our results are significant for several reasons .",
