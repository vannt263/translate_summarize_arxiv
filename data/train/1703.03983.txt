    "this paper is part of our program to investigate nearly euclidean thurston ( net ) maps .",
    "a thurston map is net if each critical point is simple and it has exactly four postcritical points .",
    "the program began with @xcite , written with jim cannon .",
    "there , we showed that each net map @xmath1 admits a factorization @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a euclidean thurston map which is affine in suitable coordinates and @xmath4 is a homeomorphism .",
    "this property motivated the term nearly euclidean .",
    "thus net maps are among the simplest thurston maps , and their associated teichmller spaces have complex dimension 1 . in @xcite",
    ", we exploited the connection to affine geometry to give effective algorithms for the computation of fundamental dynamic invariants , such as the pullback function on homotopy classes of simple closed curves .",
    "next , @xcite shows that every net map has a presentation which allows it to be described by a simple diagram , such as that shown in figures [ fig : prendgm ] , [ fig : firstprendgm ] and [ fig : degfourprendgm ] , and gives examples showing how to find such diagrams in concrete cases .",
    "the data in the diagram can then be translated into input for a computer program , netmap ( see @xcite ) , which implements the algorithms to compute the invariants .",
    "the net map website @xcite contains an overview , papers , many examples , and executable files for the computer program netmap .",
    "the survey @xcite , written jointly with g. kelsey , s. koch , r. lodge , and e. saenz , reports on findings and new phenomena from a study of the data generated and on connections to other areas .",
    "this paper develops other invariants of net maps , focusing on non - dynamical invariants .",
    "we now list these invariants and outline our first main results , in roughly decreasing order of sensitivity .",
    "suppose @xmath5 are thurston maps with postcritical sets @xmath6 .",
    "in the first four items below , @xmath7 are orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the sphere to itself .",
    "* we recall that @xmath5 are _ thurston equivalent _ if there exist such @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath7 are isotopic relative to @xmath11 .",
    "put another way , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are conjugate up to isotopy relative to their postcritical sets . 0.15 in * we say @xmath5 are _ hurwitz equivalent for the pure modular group _ if there exist such @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . the motivation for the terminology : pre- and/or post - composing @xmath1 with a homeomorphism fixing @xmath11 pointwise yields a map @xmath3 which is equivalent to @xmath1 . in suitable",
    "euclidean coordinates , the pure modular group is @xmath12 .",
    "0.15 in * we say @xmath5 are _ hurwitz equivalent for the modular group _ if there exist such @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "theorem [ thm : hurwitz ] gives a complete algebraic invariant of the modular group hurwitz type .",
    "in suitable euclidean coordinates , the modular group is @xmath14 .",
    "0.15 in * we say @xmath5 are _ topologically equivalent _ if there exist such @xmath7 with @xmath15 .",
    "0.15 in * every net map @xmath1 is topologically equivalent to a euclidean net map @xmath3 induced by a linear map @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the pair @xmath18 are the _ elementary divisors _ of @xmath1 .",
    "theorem [ thm : eleydivrs ] shows that the elementary divisors form a complete invariant of the topological equivalence class of a net map ; see also theorem [ thm : hurwitz_special ] .",
    "hence all net maps in a given modular group hurwitz class have the same elementary divisors .",
    "0.15 in * most net maps have four critical values .",
    "there are two _ atypical _ cases : elementary divisors @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "maps with these elementary divisors have two and three critical values , respectively . in atypical cases , modular group hurwitz classes may contain both net and non - net maps : the postcritical sets of some maps may have fewer than four points . in _",
    "typical _ cases , that is , all other cases , modular group hurwitz classes consist entirely of net maps",
    ". 0.15 in * given @xmath22 , the collection @xmath23 of local degrees defines a partition of @xmath24 .",
    "the _ branch data _ associated to @xmath1 is the set of such partitions as @xmath25 varies in the set of branch values of @xmath1 .",
    "section [ sec : bd ] gives a classification of the branch data associated to net maps .",
    "there are three basic types . in even degrees",
    ", in addition to the obvious riemann - hurwitz condition , there is an _ exceptional condition _ : for branch data of type 3 , the degree must be divisible by 4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.8 ) .",
    "the modular group of the four - times marked sphere @xmath26 contains a distinguished subgroup isomorphic to @xmath27 . in",
    "suitable euclidean coordinates , its elements are induced by translations .",
    "this group acts trivially on the teichmller space modelled on @xmath28 .",
    "suppose @xmath29 represents an element of this group and @xmath30 .",

    "it may also happen that @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath4 is a deck transformation of the covering induced by @xmath1 .",
    "this creates some subtleties ;  3 gives a thorough analysis .",
    "our first application is to the enumeration of representatives of net map modular group hurwitz classes .",
    "the website @xcite contains data organized first by degree , then by elementary divisors , and finally by modular group hurwitz class , giving one representative for every modular group hurwitz class through degree 30 .",

    "let @xmath3 be a euclidean net map induced by a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the elementary divisors of @xmath3 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : ed_and_bd ] and the discussion following it show that the branch data of @xmath3 is determined by the modulo 2 congruence classes of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the branch data of @xmath38 is determined by its mod 2 elementary divisors in the same way . hence the branch data of @xmath38",
    "equals the branch data of @xmath3 .",
    "now lemma  [ lemma : closing ] and theorem  [ thm : eleydivrs ] complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : portrait ] .",
    "[ remark : hyperbolictype ] a dynamic portrait has _ hyperbolic type _ if each cycle contains a critical point . for topological polynomials , any thurston map whose dynamic portrait has hyperbolic type is unobstructed , i.e. equivalent to a complex polynomial ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 10.3.9 ) .",
    "kelsey @xcite establishes a partial converse : for almost all polynomial dynamic portraits of non - hyperbolic type , there is an obstructed topological polynomial with this portrait .",
    "our data show this association between portraits and obstructedness breaks down for net maps : the modular hurwitz class 31hclass7 ( and many others ) consists entirely of unobstructed maps , and there are non - critical postcritical points .",
    "composing with translations , we may find within this class examples of unobstructed net maps with a non - critical fixed postcritical point .",
