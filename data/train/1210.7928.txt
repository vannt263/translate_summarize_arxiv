    "the presence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is one of the few empirical evidences that the current standard model of particle physics can not be complete .",
    "the dark matter density @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) @xcite is now determined very precisely from various observations .",
    "while the particle nature and genesis of the dark matter relic density remains unknown , it is intriguing that it can be explained naturally through thermal production and freeze - out of a particle with electroweak interaction strengths and mass of order of the tev scale . in this simple scenario freeze - out",
    "occurs when the universe cools below the mass of the particle and the dm particles become non - relativistic , with typical velocities of order @xmath8 .",
    "the dm pair - annihilation cross section , which determines the relic density , can then be expanded in a taylor series in @xmath9 , and keeping only the first two terms is usually a very good approximation : @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the relative velocity of the annihilating particles in their center - of - mass frame .",
    "furthermore , when dark matter particles pair - annihilate in the present universe , potentially revealing themselves in cosmic ray signatures , the typical velocities are @xmath12 , and the annihilation occurs even deeper in the non - relativistic regime .    among the many models that contain weakly interacting dark matter candidates at the tev scale ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has been studied most extensively , and for quite some time  @xcite .",
    "several programs are available @xcite which compute the annihilation cross section of the lightest neutralino , together with possible co - annihilation processes , in the mssm numerically in the tree - level approximation .",
    "the observed relic density then provides a valuable constraint on the parameter space of the model , complementary to those from collider physics .",
    "given the precision of @xmath13 , it seems desirable to compute the cross section parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 at the one - loop level .",
    "this , however , is a daunting task due to the complexity of complete one - loop calculations in the mssm , and the number of individual annihilation processes that add up to the total cross section .",
    "nevertheless , such calculations have been performed for certain scenarios where qcd corrections are the most important ones  @xcite , or in certain approximations  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the full electroweak corrections has been started @xcite .",
    "there exist situations when quantum corrections become exceedingly large and can not be neglected . in non - relativistic scattering and annihilation of dm particles",
    "this happens when the coulomb ( yukawa ) force generated by massless ( massive ) particle exchange between the dm particles becomes strong at small relative velocities , a phenomenon also known as `` sommerfeld effect '' . in the mssm",
    "this situation is naturally realized when the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) has mass above one tev , in which case the neutralino is almost a pure gauge eigenstate , and degeneracies and co - annihilation effects in the neutralino - chargino sector are generic .",
    "the sommerfeld effect in the mssm was first studied in the wino- and higgsino - limit by hisano et al .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently in `` minimal dark matter models '' @xcite that resemble the mssm in the above - mentioned limits . in these heavy dark matter scenarios",
    "the annihilation cross section can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude , since the typical distance of dm particles at small velocity is within the long - range part of the yukawa potential generated by exchange of the electroweak @xmath16 and @xmath17 gauge bosons .",
    "the suggestion @xcite that the sommerfeld enhancement due to the exchange of a new , light particle may generate an excess in the cosmic ray positron spectrum has generated a resurge of interest in this effect .",
    "the present work aims at improving the calculation of the dark matter annihilation cross section and relic abundance by including the sommerfeld radiative corrections in the general mssm , beyond the previously considered wino- and higgsino - limit .",
    "the idea is that even when the sommerfeld correction is not of order one , unlike in scenarios of tev scale lsps , it may still constitute the dominant radiative correction in a significantly larger portion of the mssm parameter space .",
    "related work has been undertaken recently in @xcite .",
    "our approach differs from or extends these works in several aspects .",
    "* we use the non - relativistic effective theory approach to separate the short - distance annihilation process from the long - distance sommerfeld effect , which is encoded in the matrix elements of local four - fermion operators .",
    "the approach is very similar to the nrqcd treatment of quarkonium annihilation @xcite , except that we deal with scattering states of several species of particles interacting through the electroweak yukawa force . *",
    "since electroweak gauge boson exchange may change the two - particle state ( for instance , scatter a neutralino pair into a pair of oppositely charged charginos ) , the annihilation process is described by a matrix in the space of two - particle states , which is not diagonal .",
    "the off - diagonal terms can not be obtained from the tree - level cross sections computed by numerical programs , and have not been considered previously , except in the simplified situation of the strict wino- and higgsino - limit  @xcite .",
    "* we compute the expansion of the short - distance annihilation cross section analytically rather than numerically . the only systematic previous analytic calculation @xcite refers to the annihilation of two lsps , but does not include co - annihilation channels and the above - mentioned off - diagonal annihilation matrix entries . *",
    "the non - relativistic annihilation cross section can be organized in a partial wave expansion .",
    "the leading - order term @xmath14 in ( [ eq : sigmav ] ) contains the leading - order contributions from @xmath18-wave annihilations , whereas the second term @xmath15 encodes both @xmath18- and @xmath19-wave annihilation contributions .",
    "the sommerfeld correction factor is different for the @xmath18- and @xmath19-wave contribution .",
    "its consistent implementation therefore requires a separation of @xmath15 into its two components , which has not been done before , but can be implemented relatively easily within our analytic framework .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the analytic calculation of the dominant @xmath18-wave annihilation coefficient @xmath14 and to outlining the general framework .",
    "the subleading term @xmath15 and the calculation of the sommerfeld effect in the mssm with almost degenerate neutralinos and charginos will be presented in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] we introduce the effective lagrangian framework and the method of calculation . in the non - relativistic mssm",
    "the short - distance annihilation process is encoded in the wilson coefficient of a four - fermion operator .",
    "we introduce the required notation and discuss the expansion in the mass differences of the nearly degenerate neutralino and chargino species . sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] discusses various examples of annihilation cross sections obtained from our analytic calculation . in this section",
    "we also perform checks by comparing some diagonal annihilation matrix entries with numerical cross sections and with @xcite .",
    "the complete analytic results are rather lengthy .",
    "we provide them in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] together with the rules to construct the mssm coupling factors of the various diagrams . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussions ] we explain why it is convenient to employ feynman gauge despite the fact that this requires the computation of many unphysical final states .",
    "we also illustrate the importance of including the off - diagonal annihilation matrix entries in the computation of the sommerfeld - corrected cross section on the example of a heavy wino - like mssm parameter point . we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we describe the kinematics and interactions of neutralinos and charginos moving at small velocities within a non - relativistic effective theory ( eft ) , the non - relativistic mssm ( nrmssm ) , that contains only nearly on - shell non - relativistic chargino and neutralino modes , while the effects from higher mass and virtual modes are encoded in the wilson coefficients of higher - dimensional operators .",
    "the neutralinos and charginos described in the eft approach are those whose masses are nearly degenerate with the mass @xmath20 of the lightest neutralino .",
    "the corresponding effective lagrangian is given by @xmath21 the kinetic part of the lagrangian for @xmath22 non - relativistic neutralino species and @xmath23 non - relativistic chargino species is given by @xmath24 the fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the non - relativistic two - component spinor fields of non - relativistic neutralinos ( @xmath27 ) and charginos ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , respectively .",
    "this eft setup with one reference mass scale , @xmath30 , is suited for the description of ( neutralino ) dark matter annihilation processes in the present universe as well as for the computation of dark matter co - annihilation reactions with further nearly mass - degenerate neutralinos and charginos in the context of the relic abundance calculation .",
    "the eft framework can easily be extended to the case where the non - relativistic particle species are ( nearly ) mass - degenerate with respect to two distinct scales @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . in that case",
    ", the mass differences @xmath33 in ( [ eq : kin ] ) have to be replaced by @xmath34 , where each @xmath35 is given by one of the scales @xmath36 . in that way",
    ", an entirety of hydrogen - like two - particle states can be described , within which a set of light , nearly mass - degenerate and another set of heavy , nearly mass - degenerate particles exists .",
    "our results for the absorptive part of the wilson coefficients , specified in sec .",
    "[ subsec : basis ] and given in the appendix , cover both the cases of a set of particles nearly mass - degenerate with the neutralino lsp and a set of non - relativistic hydrogen - like neutralino and chargino systems .",
    "the term @xmath37 summarizes ( instantaneous ) yukawa- and coulomb potential interactions that arise through the exchange of sm gauge bosons and higgs particles .",
    "the generic form of @xmath37 reads @xmath38 where the fields @xmath39 describe a two - body state of the form @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 and a sum over repeated indices is implicit .",

    "the explicit form of the potentials between neutralino and chargino species for a given mssm point will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "within the nrmssm , we aim to describe neutralino and chargino pair - annihilation processes into two - particle final states of standard model ( sm ) and ( light ) higgs particles , which are not non - relativistic .",
    "the theory will contain effects from virtual and higher - mass higgs and susy particle modes as well , encoded in the eft operator - coefficients and parameters .",
    "the specific case of resonant @xmath49-channel pair - annihilation  reactions can be covered by adding a resonance width in the analytic results that we give in the appendix .",
    "yet we exclude the case of accidental mass degeneracies of further susy particles with the set of non - relativistic neutralinos and charginos .",
    "the sm and light higgs particle final states in the neutralino and chargino pair - annihilation reactions are not described within the non - relativistic effective theory , as they are characterized by velocities outside the non - relativistic regime . however , since the hard inclusive pair - annihilation processes take place within distances of order @xmath50 , we can incorporate the short - distance annihilation rates of non - relativistic neutralinos and charginos in the effective theory through the absorptive part of wilson coefficients of local four - fermion operators in @xmath48 , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "the full annihilation rates in the non - relativistic effective theory are given by the absorptive part of the matrix elements of these four - fermion operators . while the matrix elements of the operators themselves may encode long - distance effects , giving rise to sommerfeld enhancements , the contribution to the hard annihilation reaction factors out in the form of the wilson coefficient .",
    "in contrast to the application of this formalism to quarkonium annihilation in qcd @xcite , we are going to describe annihilations of scattering states instead of bound states and allow for more than one non - relativistic particle species .",
    "the latter allows for the possibility , that ( long - range ) potential interactions ( indicated by the grey oval in fig .  [ fig : genericdiagram ] ) lead to transitions from the initially incoming two - particle state @xmath51 to another two nearly on - shell non - relativistic two - particle state @xmath52 prior to the annihilation reaction .",
    "unitarity relates the phase space integrated product of annihilation amplitudes @xmath53 in the first line of fig .",
    "[ fig : genericdiagram ] to the absorptive part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath54 depicted in the second line , where @xmath55 generically denotes a pair of sm and light higgs particles .",
    "note that due to the presence of the long - range potential interactions , the hard annihilation reaction is determined by the absorptive part of the @xmath56 amplitude , as can be seen in the second line of fig .",
    "[ fig : genericdiagram ] .",
    "it is worth to stress , that the @xmath52 particle pair is not necessarily equal to the @xmath57 pair , such that apart from true forward scattering reactions @xmath58 , we encounter off - diagonal @xmath59 reactions as well",
    ".    in this paper we are concerned with the calculation of the absorptive part of @xmath60 1-loop reactions , encoding the hard tree - level @xmath52 and @xmath57 annihilation processes .",

    ", we evaluate the absorptive part of the hard @xmath56 1-loop scattering amplitude within the mssm and match the result with the tree - level matrix element of four - fermion operators contained in @xmath48 in the effective theory . at tree - level",
    "the annihilation rates can be given separately for every final state @xmath55 , since the tree - level processes are free from infrared divergences . in higher - orders",
    "the formalism applies to the inclusive annihilation cross section @xcite , or to suitably defined infrared - safe final states .",
    "the leading - order contributions in @xmath48 are given by dimension-6 four - fermion operators .",
    "for instance , the specific dimension-6 four - fermion operator that encodes scattering of a non - relativistic incoming neutralino pair @xmath61 in a @xmath62 partial - wave state into an outgoing @xmath61 state in the same @xmath62 partial - wave configuration is given by @xmath63 where the spinor @xmath64 is the charge conjugate of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 specifies the second pauli matrix .",
