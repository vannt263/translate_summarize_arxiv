    "in the last few years a considerable progress has been made in the development and investigation of various types of electromagnetic traps for different but especially polar molecules .",
    "the building of such traps should have made it possible to perform many interesting experimental studies and applications involving the manipulation of cooled and trapped molecules with kinetic temperatures near zero kelvin  @xcite .",
    "schemes for creating samples of cold molecules are being developed now in several laboratories around the world where simple molecules at kinetic temperatures in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 range are being created and studied .",
    "one of the main purposes in the perfection of traps is to keep samples of molecules dense and cold enough and the microwave trap seems to be very advantageous in restraining polar molecules  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we are studying the collisional dynamics of linear polar molecules in the @xmath2 state trapped in a microwave field with a circular polarization at cold temperatures .",
    "the choice of linear polarization does not seem very appealing as it was shown in  @xcite as ac- stark levels have a lot of avoiding crossings which enhances the collisional loss .",
    "polar molecules have strong permanent electric dipole moments and therefore the collisional dynamics is mostly ruled by the dipole - dipole interaction : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the electric dipole moment of the molecule @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the intermolecular separation and @xmath7 .",
    "thus in our model collisions are controlled by two ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9  ( @xmath10 is the microwave frequency , @xmath11 is the molecular rotational constant , and @xmath12 is the electric field strength ) .",
    "we are using the coupled - channels method to calculate elastic and inelastic cross sections in dependence on the frequency and the strength of an ac electric field .",
    "it has to be noted that collisional dynamics of cold polar molecules in the dc- electric field was rather intensively theoretically explored which revealed quite rich physics  @xcite    one of the main goals is to understand if polar molecules in their absolute ground state can have a successful evaporative cooling . at first sight",
    "it seems rather an inappropriate question as molecules are in their absolute ground state .",
    "naturally , if the energy of the first excited rotational state is smaller than the microwave frequency(@xmath13 ) it seems that the system is safe against two - body inelastic collisions and collision losses are excluded . and",
    "this is true for bare particles .",
    "but it might be not completely true for particles dressed with a microwave field , especially for parameters which provide a large and deep trap(@xmath14 ) .",
    "as we have seen the reason is that the ac- field and the dipole - dipole interaction are mixing states with different angular moments and `` dressing '' .",
    "we have found that even for the most favourable case @xmath13 , there are inelastic processes .",
    "but these processes are causing mostly the `` undressing '' or `` dressing '' of the colliding particles without changing their internal structure . here",
    "we have to be careful about the term `` mostly '' as dressed states are the superposition of lots of pure states .",
    "but what we can be sure of is that these `` dressing''-``undressing '' processes do not cause the loss of molecules from the trap .",
    "moreover this is supposedly be true not only for molecules in their absolute ground state @xmath15 , but for example in the @xmath16 state at frequencies around @xmath17 , for molecules @xmath18 at frequencies around @xmath19 and so on(@xmath20-rotational quantum number ) .",
    "actually how far this `` around '' goes depends on the strength of the ac- field .",
    "we have found that during the collisions the parity of the projection of the total momentum of two colliding dressed molecules is conserved .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the cross sections for such positive and negative projection parities are different by several orders of magnitude .",
    "here we analyze the ac - stark shift , which determines the trap depth .",
    "the energy levels of @xmath22- type molecules can be described by rotation @xmath20 , total spin @xmath23 ( i.e. , including nuclear spin ) , and vibration @xmath24 quantum numbers . for simplicity",
    "we will neglect hyperfine splitting and consider molecules only in the @xmath25 vibrational ground state .",
    "so we treat polar molecules as rigid rotors with a permanent dipole moment .",
    "the dressed- state formalism is particularly convenient for describing the photon - atom interaction in the strong field limit  @xcite where the dressed states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the total system : particle plus photon .",
    "the basis states of the rigid rotor plus field hamiltonian , @xmath26 are @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the projection of @xmath20 on space - fixed axis , which is conveniently chosen parallel to the wave - vector of the microwave field . , @xmath29 is the dressed state photon number and @xmath30 is the deviation of the photon number .",
    "the ac- stark splitting is caused by the molecule- field interaction @xmath31 . considering the circularly polarized microwave field ( @xmath32 ) , the non - zero hamiltonian matrix elements ( normalized by @xmath33 ) are given by @xmath34 here ,",
    "it is assumed that @xmath35 is much smaller than the mean photon number @xmath36 . in the ac- electric field",
    "the @xmath37 are not good quantum numbers and the dressed state formalism should be applied .",
    "the ac- electric field mixes states with different @xmath20 , @xmath28 and @xmath35 and hence neither of them is a good quantum number .",
    "thus we can only mark our states by their origin at zero field(fig.[stark ] ) where they can be assigned by @xmath20 and @xmath28 quantum numbers .",
    "figure [ stark ] shows the energies of dressed states versus applied electric field frequency for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states at @xmath40 within @xmath41 $ ] frequency range .",
    "first we would like to consider the ground and so the lowest- field seeking state @xmath15 .",
    "though the term lowest - field seeking state does not seem appropriate in dressed state formalism . in practice",
    "we transform the molecular state to a field - dressed basis for performing scattering calculations and the state with a given mean photon number @xmath42 is described as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 stands for the eigenfunctions of the @xmath45 hamiltonian determined numerically at each value of the field.we will continue to refer to the molecular states by the quantum numbers @xmath20 , @xmath28 , and @xmath35 , with the understanding that they are only approximately good in a field , and that eq .  [ mix ] is the appropriate molecular state .",
    "note that ac- stark splitting should be irrelevant to the value of @xmath46 as @xmath30 so we choose small values of @xmath35 .",
    "further we are mostly interested in cases in which the strength of the ac- field is not large(@xmath47 ) which is found to be more practical for a microwave trap  @xcite . in this case",
    "the above mentioned mixing is not that strong and allows us to analyze different cases .",
    "let us consider @xmath49 state which is a pure @xmath50 if we neglect the molecule- field interaction @xmath51 and describe molecules in their absolute ground state . in",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that the most relevant trap parameters are at @xmath52 and the ratio @xmath53 . in this case the state of interest is approximately described as : @xmath54 it has to be noted that at @xmath52 , @xmath55 . at larger @xmath56 admixtures of other states , like @xmath57 and so on are not small . here",
    "we would like to point out that if trapped molecules are in this state @xmath49 it is equal to saying that trapped molecules are in @xmath58 states as the ac stark shift is the same for all of them .",
    "moreover the @xmath45 hamiltonian does not mix , for example , states like @xmath49 and @xmath59 .",
    "but the dipole- dipole interaction can mix them as the @xmath60 scattering processes are possible . in order to reveal the possibility of such processes one has to see that at @xmath52 and the ratio @xmath53 these states are mostly described as : @xmath61 thus the @xmath62 matrix elements provide for the above - mentioned process and their values depend on @xmath63 eigenstates .    at @xmath64 the only two inelastic processes may have considerable cross sections : @xmath65 note that the threshold energies of @xmath66 and @xmath67 channels are degenerate .",
    "at @xmath68 the @xmath69 state becomes energetically accessible(see fig .",
    "[ stark ] ) so that the @xmath70 inelastic process is possible .      in this region of frequencies",
    "our state of interest @xmath49 is approximately described as : @xmath72 if the strength of the field is not large(see fig .",
    "[ stark ] ) then in the middle of this region this state is an almost pure @xmath73 state . as @xmath8 gets close to five",
    ", the state is dominated by the @xmath74 state .",
    "so the larger the frequency of the ac- electric field , the larger particular angular moment @xmath20 will be dominated . but",
    "this is only true if the strength of a field is not large(@xmath75 ) .",
    "otherwise , at a large @xmath56 , the dressed state will be a superposition of a lot of states .",
    "compared to the @xmath48 case there is one extra open channel for inelastic collisions : @xmath76 moreover our state in this region of frequencies becomes a weak - field seeking one while the state @xmath77 becomes a strong - field seeking state .",
    "the main difference from the dc electric field case is that in general inelastic processes are always allowed for any non - zero field and for any state .",
    "of course an inelastic cross section will be very small at small fields but not exactly zero . in the following we focus only on bosonic species .",
    "the case of fermionic species will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we have solved the coupled- channel equations using the logarithmic derivative propagator method @xcite to calculate total state - to - state cross sections.the scattering calculations quickly become computationally expensive as more rotational states , partial waves and dressed - state photon numbers are included . we have found that it is enough to take @xmath78 ; @xmath79 for bosons and @xmath80 for fermions and @xmath81 for changing photon numbers to get reasonably converged cross sections .",
    "the only two - body interaction taken into account here is the dipole - dipole interaction which is sufficient to describe the qualitative behavior of cross sections .",
    "we have not chosen any particular polar molecule for calculation but a rigid rotor with the rotational constant @xmath82 and dipole moment @xmath83 .",
    "for this molecule , we are mostly interested in the lowest energy strong - field - seeking state of the ground vibrational state .",
    "the cross sections were calculated for dressed molecules , which means we show them for molecules in @xmath84 basis .",
    "the trap depth for this particular molecule is @xmath85 at @xmath86 and @xmath87 at @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "it is @xmath90 at @xmath88 and @xmath91 . for the high frequency case @xmath92",
    "it is only @xmath93 at @xmath88 .",
    "we have found that if one takes into account only the dipole - dipole interaction in the presence of an ac - field the only conserved value for two molecules in @xmath94 states is @xmath95 which we call a projection parity .",
    "thus the system of the coupled- channel equations is split into two blocks with a positive and negative projection parity .",
    "the nature of this symmetry will be described elsewhere .",
    "[ f6e4 ] shows cross sections for bosonic and fermionic species for the @xmath96 state at @xmath88 and @xmath97 parameters which are proposed as more relevant for the future experiment  @xcite .",
    "the black and red curves are for positive and negative projection parities respectively .",
    "the largest inelastic cross section is for @xmath98 transitions and moreover it is not small and the threshold behavior is similar to that of an elastic process .",
    "the latter is clear as these states are degenerate .",
    "such inelastic transition can be described as the `` dressing '' or `` undressing '' of molecules by one photon each .",
    "will this `` undressing '' cause the loss of molecules from the trap ?",
    "we believe that it will not as in the limit of a strong field the stark shift as well as the trap depth will be the same for dressed states with @xmath42 and @xmath99 photons . the only inelastic process which causes the trap loss is @xmath100 . but the cross section for it is relatively small in the region from about @xmath101 to @xmath102 and even maybe at lower temperatures .",
    "one can see that there exists some resonance structure .",
    "we do not take any notice of these resonances as they are defined by an unknown short - range part of the interaction which in our case is simply modeled by the inner wall of the interaction .",
    "thus after all our `` absolute ground state '' molecules undergo inelastic transitions .",
    "though at @xmath103 and @xmath104 trapped molecules will feel pretty safe .",
    "it is noteworthy to note that the elastic cross sections are much larger for positive parities at ultracold energies(around @xmath105 ) especially while they are more or less of the same order at cold energies(around @xmath106 ) .",
    "we have found that the threshold behavior of the inelastic cross section for bosonic molecules with a negative projection parity does not follow the wigner law at the shown collisional energies at least .",
    "the only reason we can think of is that for a given projection parity not all projections @xmath107 of the partial wave @xmath108 are involved .",
    "this phenomenon will be studied elsewhere .",
    "[ e2 ] shows cross sections for @xmath86 and different @xmath109 ratios . though the trap depth is not that deep for this @xmath56 it is still several @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to pay attention to the relatively small value of the field strength as in this case dressed states are mostly superpositions only of only two pure states or even sometimes one pure state  ( see discussions in section ii ) . in this case",
    "it is easy to analyze hidden details . at @xmath110 ratio",
    "the field is rather weak so dressed states are almost pure states ( for example , it means that , say , @xmath111 , see eq.(5 - 8 ) ) and all inelastic cross sections are small . at @xmath104 ratio",
    "the dressed states are mostly superpositions of two states(eq.(5 - 8 ) ) which considerably enhance `` dressing''-``undressing '' inelastic processes involving considerable transitions to @xmath16 states by means of the dipole - dipole interaction(eq.8 ) .",
    "nevertheless such transitions are between equally trapped states @xmath58 . at @xmath112 ratio",
    "the dressed state of interest is by the largest part the @xmath113 state and it is already a weak - field seeking state .",
    "moreover one can see that inelastic cross sections which may cause the loss from a trap are really small .",
    "we may suppose that it is possible to prepare polar molecules in their @xmath16 states and then load them into a microwave field at a frequency @xmath114 around @xmath115 .",
    "it is probable that the same trick can be done with , say , @xmath116 molecules by loading them into a microwave field at a frequency @xmath114 around @xmath117 .",
    "we have found out that the cross sections have rather a weak dependence on the frequency of an ac - field(fig.[f2],[f15 ] ) for large values of the strength of a field(@xmath118 at @xmath119 ) .",
    "both elastic and inelastic cross sections are more or less of the same order .",
    "of course there is rather a rich resonance structure of cross sections which reflects the fact of the existence of lots of bound states in closed channels .",
    "we do not pay attention to this fact as the short - range potential is unknown and simply parameterized by the inner wall .",
    "but we would like to note that the positions of resonances will depend not on the strength of a field(like it is for dc - field  @xcite ) but also on a frequency .",
    "thus simply changing the frequency of a field one can catch a resonance .",
    "this issue will be under our investigation elsewhere .",
    "fig.[f2 ] shows that at large values of field the inelastic `` dressing''-``undressing '' cross sections become comparable with the elastic one but the low frequency(@xmath120 ) does not allow other trap losses processes .",
    "thus the evaporative cooling may be successful for rather large strengths of ac - field as well .",
    "but it has to be checked as for a larger field we have to take a larger hilbert space of basis states @xmath121 .",
    "it means that some other inelastic channels with larger @xmath20,@xmath28 and @xmath35 may appear at a larger field and `` destroy '' such a pleasant picture .",
    "but it will be very costly numerically as we will have to handle up to several thousands of coupled - channels equations .",
    "fig.[f15 ] shows the same pattern of behavior for a higher frequency .",
    "the only difference is that there already are some inelastic channels at large fields which definitely cause trap losses .    to recapitulate ,",
    "we have computed scattering cross sections for cold collisions of the bosonic polar @xmath21- type molecules as functions of both collision energy and ac electric field parameters .",
    "we found that even ground state molecules have inelastic transitions .",
    "though most of them are harmless and allow keeping molecules in a trap .",
    "we suggested that polar molecules at @xmath122 states may have a successful evaporative cooling in the appropriate region of frequencies of a microwave field and will be restrained and shielded by this field against collision losses .",
