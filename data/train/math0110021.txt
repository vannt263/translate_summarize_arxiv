    "it is generally accepted that the theory of surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space @xmath1 with constant mean curvature equal to one ( cmc-1 surfaces , for short ) started with a seminal paper by r. bryant ( @xcite ) , where he derives a representation for such surfaces in terms of holomorphic data .",
    "more precisely , bryant s recipe works as follows .",
    "start with a holomorphic curve @xmath2 which is null with respect to the conformal structure inherited from the killing - cartan form and recall the natural projection @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is realized via the hermitian model and @xmath5 is the group of orientation preserving isometries of @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that , at least locally , any cmc-1 surface is of the form @xmath6 for some such @xmath7 . in this setting ,",
    "the primary object is a pair of holomorphic functions defining another ( holomorphic ) curve on the lie algebra of @xmath5 from which @xmath8 is obtained after solving a certain first order differential equation .",
    "thus an integration procedure appears in the description and this partially accounted for the inherent difficulties in constructing examples at the very early stages of the theory .",
    "but notice however the striking analogy with the well - known weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , as these are obtained as real slices of null curves in @xmath10 .",
    "after the appearance of bryant s investigation , many other researchers contributed to the subject .",
    "for example , starting with the paper @xcite , m. umehara and k. yamada refined substantially bryant s approach and were able to construct a varied class of examples of cmc-1 surfaces , besides developing many interesting global aspects in the theory . on the other hand , inspired by hitchin s generalization ( @xcite ) of penrose s twistor theory ,",
    "a. j. small ( @xcite ) gave a clean characterization of null curves in @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , small realizes @xmath5 as the complement of the quadric @xmath11 and observes that twistors lead naturally to the construction of a gauss transform @xmath12 of a null curve @xmath2 as a curve lying in @xmath13 , the quadric dual to @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , he shows that , aside from the technical issue of missing points lying in @xmath14 , one has @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dual to @xmath12 .",
    "this gives a classical procedure for recovering @xmath7 from @xmath12 and in this context one is naturally compelled to regard the gauss transform as the primary object .",
    "the final blow is the well - known fact that @xmath17 , a product of two projective lines , and we can locally represent @xmath18 for holomorphic functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the riemann surface @xmath21 underlying @xmath22 . since dualization is carried out by applying algebraic operations on the derivatives up to second order of @xmath23 one ends up with an explicit formula for cmc-1 surfaces involving no integration whatsoever ! we stress that this approach has the obvious drawback of being local in nature but the elimination of quadratures reminds us of an alternative ( and much lesser known ) way of describing the classical weiertrass representation , which was rediscovered in modern times by hitchin ( @xcite ) and small ( @xcite ) again by using twistorial methods .",
    "the above historical account reflects an attempt to interpret the prevalent view in the cmc-1 surfaces community .",
    "consensual as it may be , the main purpose of this note is to point out that it is not entirely correct . in effect , in bianchi s lezioni di geometria differenziale ( @xcite ) , edited in 1927 , we may find a recipe for constructing cmc-1 surfaces out of holomorphic data .",
    "however , the motivation for writing this note goes beyond this historical curiosity , for it seems that there are at least two other reasons for exhibiting this old method to a wider audience .",
    "the first one is that the method allows one to start with an arbitrary holomorphic map @xmath24 defined in a region @xmath25 and , elaborating upon bianchi s ideas , to end up with explicit formulae for a cmc-1 surface ( see theorem [ cent2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , this map @xmath19 has an immediate geometric interpretation : it is simply the parametrized hyperbolic gauss map , or in other words , the expression for the hyperbolic gauss map in terms of a local complex parameter on @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the resulting formulae involve algebraic expressions in terms of the derivatives of @xmath19 up to second order and no integration at all . as such , they come close to the spirit of small s approach as described above .",
    "in fact , and this is an important issue here , our formulae coincide with small s if the pertinent transformation between models for @xmath1 is carried out ( see section [ bcmeth ] ) .",
    "the second reason is that in his way toward the construction of cmc-1 surfaces , bianchi translates to hyperbolic geometry the solution of a strictly euclidean - geometric problem involving the rolling of a pair of isometric surfaces , thereby establishing a surprising linking between these two geometries . as a bonus ,",
    "his approach is entirely elementary in the sense that for its understanding it is only required familiarity with the fundamentals of three definitely classical disciplines : euclidean geometry , hyperbolic geometry and complex function theory .",
    "this should be compared to the heavy algebraic - geometric machinery used by small .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ clasec ]",
    "we review some classical concepts in order to describe the rolling problem in euclidean geometry .",
    "in particular we derive , following bianchi , the so called cal s formulae . in section [ bcmeth ]",
    "we relate the solution of the euclidean problem of section [ clasec ] to the construction of cmc-1 surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain an explicit parametrization for a cmc-1 surface in terms of a conformal map .",
    "finally in section [ examp ] we exhibit some simple examples constructed via the bianchi - cal method .",
    "here is the first classical concept we shall meet . a _ congruence of spheres _ is a smooth two - parameter family of spheres in @xmath27 that we will suppose parametrized by coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "to each such congruence we may associate a function @xmath29 , the _ radius function _ , describing the radii of the spheres in the congruence .",
    "we also assume that the vector function @xmath30 describing the centers of the spheres defines a regular surface which we call the _ surface of centers_. such a congruence of spheres will be denoted by @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "generically there are two surfaces , the so - called _ envelopes _ , associated to a given congruence @xmath31 $ ] . in effect",
    ", a point @xmath32 belongs to an envelope @xmath33 if @xmath34 for some sphere @xmath35 in @xmath31 $ ] and moreover @xmath36 .",
    "the next proposition gives the expression for the envelopes in terms of the unit normal vector @xmath37 and the metric of the surface of centers .",
    "in coordinates @xmath28 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 here , the matrix @xmath41 $ ] is the inverse of the matrix defined by the metric in the given coordinates .",
    "the conditions defining the envelopes are expressed as @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath45 , so that taking derivatives of ( [ env ] ) and using the fact that @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 now , write @xmath48 take inner products of this with @xmath49 and @xmath50 and solve the linear system @xmath51 so as to obtain @xmath52 finally , @xmath53 is further determined using that @xmath54 : @xmath55 substitution yields the desired formula for the envelopes .",
    "if a congruence of spheres has two distinct envelopes we then have a natural correspondence between their points , namely , points on distinct envelopes correspond if they are the contact points of the envelopes with a given sphere of the congruence . we will allow the degenerate case where one of the envelopes reduces to a point and notice that even in this situation the unit vector @xmath44 appearing in the above proposition is still well defined , a fact we shall use in the following result due originally to beltrami .    [ bel ] let @xmath31 $ ] be a congruence of spheres with @xmath56 being one of its envelopes ( possibly degenerated to a point ) , obtained say by choosing the positive sign in ( [ form ] ) , and consider the angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 formed between the unit vector @xmath44 in the direction of @xmath59 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "suppose further that another surface @xmath61 isometric to @xmath62 is given and consider the congruence of spheres @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "finally , let @xmath64 be the envelope for @xmath65 $ ] obtained by choosing the same sign as we did in order to get @xmath56 starting from @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "then the angles between the unit vector @xmath66 in the direction of @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , where @xmath69 is the unit normal to @xmath70 , coincide with the corresponding angles for @xmath31 $ ] .    from ( [ mix ] ) , ( [ expnu ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) one has @xmath71 and since the surfaces of centers of the congruences , which have the same radius function , are isometric to each other , the right hand sides above are the same when we consider the angles of both congruences .",
    "= 8.4 cm    fig .",
    "2.1      we now describe the rolling of isometric surfaces and show how a congruence of spheres is associated to such a rolling . consider a pair @xmath72 of isometric surfaces in @xmath27 and let @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 be points corresponding under the isometry .",
    "suppose @xmath35 is fixed in space and consider the two - parameter family of positions of congruent copies of @xmath76 such that to each @xmath34 we consider a rigid motion of @xmath77 ( call it @xmath78 ) sending @xmath79 to @xmath73 , @xmath80 to @xmath81 , and further adjusted so that the differential of the isometry composed with @xmath78 is the identity map .",
    "this two - parameter family of positions for copies of @xmath76 is called the _ rolling _ of @xmath76 over @xmath35 .",
    "the surface @xmath76 is called the _ rolled surface _ and @xmath35 the _ support surface_.    now fix a point @xmath82 @xmath83 and consider its image under the two - parameter family of rigid motions associated to the rolling of @xmath76 over @xmath35 . in the generic case , the motion of @xmath82 defines a surface @xmath8 called the _ rolling surface _",
    "with respect to the _ satellite point _ @xmath82 .",
    "the crucial point now is that the two concepts introduced so far , namely congruence of spheres and rolling of surfaces , share a close relationship .",
    "more precisely , we have    given a rolling of @xmath76 over @xmath35 as above , the rolling surface @xmath84 can be viewed as an envelope of a congruence of spheres having @xmath35 as its surface of centers and the sizes of the corresponding line segments joining points of @xmath76 to @xmath82 as radii .",
    "look at @xmath82 as a degenerate envelope corresponding to the congruence of spheres having @xmath76 as surface of centers and passing through @xmath82 , see figure 2.1 . by proposition",
    "[ bel ] , an envelope of the congruence with @xmath35 as the surface of centers , and same radius function as the congruence just considered , has the property that the unit vector joining a point of it to the corresponding point of @xmath35 makes the same angles ( with respect to the obvious fixed basis ) than the corresponding unit vector joining a point @xmath85 to @xmath82 makes with the corresponding basis .",
    "but this shows that the point of the envelope coincides with the point of the rolling surface .",
    "we are now in a position to formulate the problem in euclidean geometry that will lead us , according to bianchi , to a method for constructing cmc-1 surfaces in @xmath1 :    _ find pairs _",
    "@xmath72 _  of isometric surfaces such that , for a convenient satellite point _",
    "@xmath82 , _  the rolling surface _",
    "@xmath84 _ _  is contained in a plane .",
    "_ _    to solve this problem we work with cartesian coordinates @xmath86 in @xmath9 , suppose that the plane in question is @xmath87 and moreover that the satellite point @xmath82 is the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote corresponding points for @xmath76 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair @xmath72 to be a solution to our problem are @xmath90 the first condition expressing that @xmath35 and @xmath76 are isometric , and the second one coming from the assumption that the radius of the sphere of the congruence equals the distance from @xmath79 to @xmath82 .",
    "we now write @xmath76 in polar coordinates @xmath91 centered at @xmath92 so that @xmath93 locally , @xmath76 can be parametrized by an open subset of the unit sphere @xmath94 centered at @xmath82 via the inverse of central projection so that if we write the metric of @xmath76 in these coordinates we get @xmath95 on the other hand , ( [ x2 ] ) and ( [ saf ] ) imply @xmath96 and choosing @xmath97 , so that @xmath35 now lies in the _ upper _ half - space , we obtain , after using ( [ dxxx ] ) , @xmath98 which we may interpret as follows : _ the central projection of _",
    "@xmath76 _ over _ @xmath94 _ and the orthogonal projection of _ @xmath35 _ onto the plane _ @xmath87 _ define a conformal map from _",
    "@xmath94 _ to the plane _ @xmath87 .",
    "thus we make our first contact with complex function theory .    via stereographic projection",
    "we introduce on @xmath94 the complex variable @xmath99 so that in terms of this parameter one gets the coordinates of @xmath100 : @xmath101    much in the same vein , we can parametrize the corresponding piece in @xmath35 via a local inverse of the orthonormal projection by means of the complex parameter @xmath102 the discussion above allows us to consider @xmath103 as a holomorphic function of @xmath104 : @xmath105 see figure 2.2 .",
    "in other words , @xmath19 describes the isometry between the surfaces in terms of the above chosen complex parameters .",
    "= 4.6 cm    fig .",
    "2.2    the final step is to determine @xmath106 in terms of @xmath19 . using ( [ metro ] ) and",
    "( [ param ] ) we get @xmath107 from which we conclude that @xmath108 and we have finally met the solution to our problem , namely , the coordinates of @xmath76 and @xmath35 are respectively given in terms of the holomorphic data as    @xmath109    and    @xmath110    the above expressions are called _",
    "cal s formulae _ since they have been originally published by b. cal in 1899 ( @xcite ) in another context involving isometric surfaces .",
    "in last section , starting with a holomorphic map @xmath19 , we have determined a pair of isometric surfaces such that one of the envelopes of the associated congruence of spheres was a plane .",
    "notice that we also arranged things so that the surface of centers was placed in the upper half - space .",
    "now , in principle we could also determine the second envelope of the congruence associated to the rolling , which is then also contained in the upper half space .",
    "it can be shown that the correspondence between the envelopes of the congruence associated to the cal s pair @xmath111 considered in the last section is a conformal map .",
    "this is proved in bianchi s lezioni when he considers darboux congruencies and is one of the ingredients in the proof of the following central result , also due to bianchi .",
    "[ central ] to each pair @xmath112 of isometric surfaces such that the rolling surface @xmath8 of the rolling of @xmath100 over @xmath35 is a plane there corresponds a cmc-1 given by the second envelope of the associated congruence of spheres considered as a surface in the standard upper half space model of @xmath1 .",
    "look at the spheres of our congruence as horospheres by using the upper half - space containing the surface of centers as a model for @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", the correpondence between the envelopes becomes the hyperbolic gauss map for the second envelope , which is known to be conformal , exception made for totally umbilical surfaces , exactly when the surface is a cmc-1 surface ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "although bianchi indicates how one can find cmc-1 surfaces starting with an arbitrary horlomorphic map @xmath19 via theorem [ central ] , he does not complete his analysis by deriving explicit formulae . in the following ,",
    "we carry out the calculations and exhibit a cmc-1 surface in @xmath1 in terms of the map @xmath19 .",
    "the method is indeed very simple : we use cal s formulae ( [ rr ] ) and ( [ calo2 ] ) to compute the surface of centers @xmath35 and the radius function @xmath106 , then we calculate the envelopes of this congruence of spheres , one of them being a piece of the plane @xmath87 and the other one being our cmc-1 surface . in the end of this section , we check that these formulae coincide with small s and this proves that they define a cmc-1 surface indeed and moreover that any cmc-1 arises locally in this way .",
    "we insist however that a proof of these assertions can be given in an elementary way and entirely avoiding small s results : one just has to check directly the validity of the above statements regarding conformality .",
    "we stick to the approach presented in the sequel just to stress the equivalence between the two methods .",
    "[ cent2 ] in the above situation , the parametrization of a cmc-1 surfaces in terms of @xmath19 is given by @xmath113    in terms of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the radius function @xmath106 , the surface @xmath35 is written as @xmath116 so that the coefficients of the metric become @xmath117 where we used the cauchy - riemann equations for @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding determinant is @xmath118 and moreover @xmath119 where @xmath120 so that the unit normal vector is @xmath121    on the other hand , the inverse of the matrix associated to the metric is @xmath122 from ( [ firm ] ) and ( [ farm ] ) we obtain @xmath123 and @xmath124 so that in particular , @xmath125    in order to calculate the envelopes we use ( [ form ] ) in the form @xmath126 so that @xmath127 , the envelope contained in @xmath87 , is given by @xmath128 as expected , and @xmath129 , our cmc-1 surface , is @xmath130 an explicit formula entirely in terms of @xmath19 can be found if we use ( [ rr ] ) to obtain @xmath131 it then follows from ( [ alp ] ) that @xmath132 and similarly , @xmath133 on the other hand , @xmath134 assembling together all the pieces of our computation we can finally write down the coordinates for the sought cmc-1 surface as described in the theorem .",
    "bianchi s construction is local in the sense that he assumes that the projections defining @xmath19 are both bijective .",
    "but as the ruled example in section [ examp ] suggests , we may imagine a global construction by considering function elements on appropriate riemann surfaces .",
    "cal also published formulae similar to ( [ calo1])-([calo2 ] ) corresponding to a rolling problem where the plane is replaced by the sphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a variant of the argument above applied to this case then furnishes explicit formulae for cmc-1 surfaces in the poincar model .",
    "retracing through the above construction , it is not hard to check that @xmath19 is the hyperbolic gauss map @xmath135 of the corresponding cmc-1 surface .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 is given by ( [ bicalo ] ) .",
    "we finish this section by briefly indicating how small s result relates to the one presented here .",
    "recall from ( [ sma ] ) the local representation for the gauss transform @xmath12 of a null curve @xmath2 in terms of a pair @xmath23 of holomorphic functions . according to ( [ small ] )",
    ", one has to apply dualization to this in order to recover @xmath8 . after doing this ,",
    "one obtains that @xmath7 is given by the map @xmath138 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the expression for the cmc-1 surface in terms of the hermitian model is , according to bryant , given by @xmath142 , but in order to compare this with ( [ bicalo ] ) one has to perform the transformation to the upper half - space model . in terms of the entries of @xmath143 ,",
    "this is given by @xmath144 we now take @xmath145 and small s @xmath19 to be our @xmath19 . a straightforward computation yields the equivalence between the methods .",
    "we illustrate the method by retrieving two well - known examples . first , if we take @xmath146 substitution in ( [ bicalo ] ) after writing @xmath147 yields",
