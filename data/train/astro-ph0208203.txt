    "planets are believed to form during the first @xmath0100 my of a star s life from matter in a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the initial stages of that process have been viewed with increasing clarity in high - resolution images of young stars obtained with the hubble space telescope .",
    "these have revealed complex disk structures on scales of tens to hundreds of au around @xmath01 my old objects @xcite .",
    "probing the inner parts of disks , where terrestrial planets formed in our solar system and where giant planets are found in many exo - solar systems @xcite , however , is still well beyond the reach of the current generation of telescopes . here",
    "we report observations of a remarkable eclipsing solar - like star at an age of @xmath03 my , which is providing a glimpse of the structure and possibly evolution of circumstellar matter on scales as fine as 0.01 au .",
    "this is possible because of its unique geometry that results in the star being periodically eclipsed by extended non - luminous matter in its vicinity .",
    "no other object in the history of astronomy has been found to behave in quite the same way .",
    "the star in question , kh 15d ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , epoch 2000 ; see @xcite for an identification chart ) , was first noticed in 1997 as a unique and potentially important object during a photometric monitoring program of young clusters undertaken with a small telescope at van vleck observatory ( vvo ) on the campus of wesleyan university in middletown , ct @xcite .",
    "it undergoes a very deep ( @xmath03.5 mag ) eclipse every 48.3 days and remains in the faint state for about 18 days , suggesting that the eclipsing body is non - luminous circumstellar matter .",
    "remarkably , there is a central reversal of variable height that sometimes returns the star to its out - of - eclipse level ( and once to an even brighter level ) for a brief time near mid - eclipse .",
    "a follow - up study by @xcite revealed that the star has a mass of 0.5 - 1 solar masses , and a radius of about 1.3 solar radii , indicating that it is still in its contraction phase towards the main sequence and has not yet initiated hydrogen burning in its core .",
    "its pre - main sequence status is confirmed by the presence of li i in its spectrum and its membership in the young open cluster ngc 2264 , which has an age of 2 - 4 my and a distance of 760 pc @xcite .",
    "no other star , among the thousands monitored in the vvo program or elsewhere over more than a decade @xcite has behaved in similar fashion .",
    "the closest analogues we can find in the astronomical literature are @xmath3 aur , an f - type supergiant which is eclipsed every 27 years by dark circumstellar matter @xcite , and bm ori , an early b star which is eclipsed every 6.5 days by something dark orbiting it @xcite .",
    "neither star is solar - like nor are the eclipses even remotely similar to those of kh 15d .",
    "to investigate this phenomenon in more detail , we organized , during the 2001/2002 observing season , an international campaign aimed at obtaining precision photometry with the highest possible time resolution over the longest possible time interval .",
    "a full report on this effort will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we provide a brief overview of the phenomena and an ephemeris to facilitate observations .",
    "the principal sources of optical photometric data were telescopes of 0.6 - 1.5 m aperture at the u. s. naval observatory s ( usno ) flagstaff observing station in arizona , maidanak observatory in uzbekistan , wise observatory in israel , kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) and vvo .",
    "additional contributions , some at earlier epochs , came from calar alto observatory in spain , the european southern observatory in chile and a campus telescope at colgate university in new york .",
    "differential photometry relative to a grid of local comparison stars was used to establish zero points and combine the data .",
    "photometric accuracy is @xmath00.02 mag out of eclipse but , because of the faintness of the star and its proximity to a much brighter cluster member , declines to @xmath00.1 mag during eclipse .",
    "most observations were obtained in the i band of the cousins system but some other filters were used , as discussed below .",
    "we obtained some data on all five eclipses that occurred during the observing interval 11 sept .",
    "2001 to 3 april 2002 ; excellent coverage was obtained on the last three eclipses , in dec .",
    ", jan .- feb . , and mar .",
    ", respectively .",
    "a portion of the light curve , including the three well - sampled eclipses of last season , is shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] .",
    "the basic features , including a rapid ingress and egress phase , a deep , structured minimum with central reversal , and an eclipse duration of about 40% of each cycle are evident . combining these data with what has been observed over the six year interval since its discovery",
    ", we have derived a new ephemeris for mid - eclipse :    @xmath4    the current width of the eclipses , measured at the 16.25 mag .",
    "level is almost exactly 0.4 in phase , or 19.3 days .",
    "ingress and egress begin approximately 1.5 and 1.9 days before or after the 16.25 mag level , respectively .",
    "the rate of decline becomes much shallower about 0.5 days after that level is reached , and the deepest minimum may not occur until many days later .",
    "there were also subtle variations from eclipse to eclipse last season , as may be noticed by close inspection of fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] .",
    "in fact , while this requires verification , it appears quite possible that the true period for this star is not the average interval between eclipses ( 48.36 days ) , but twice that , 96.72 days . in particular ,",
    "the  central \" reversals of alternate eclipses are slightly offset from mid - eclipse by similar amounts but in opposite direction while the adjacent minima are symmetric , but in mirror image fashion .",
    "a second remarkable result from last season s intensive monitoring effort is that the breadth of the eclipse and height of the central reversal have continued to evolve in secular fashion ( see fig .",
    "[ eclipse ] ) . phasing all of the photometry obtained over the six year interval since its discovery with the 48.36 d period",
    ", we see that the most recent data define the outer limits of the eclipse in phase . that is , at earlier epochs ,",
    "eclipses were clearly of shorter duration and the central reversals often reached much brighter levels , sometimes climbing to the out - of - eclipse level or , in one case , slightly brighter .",
    "[ eclipse ] may represent the first detection of changing structure in the circumstellar disk of a young star and provides a serious challenge to models of the system .",
    "it is currently impossible to predict how the eclipses will evolve with time , but the fact that they are changing so dramatically on human time scales underscores the necessity to keep monitoring this star .",
    "ingress and egress are remarkably smooth and have shapes that are well represented by the steady advance or retreat of a  knife - edge \" across a limb - darkened star . in the case of ingress",
    "this takes @xmath01.9 d , while for egress it is slightly longer ",
    "@xmath02.4 d. a comparison between the knife - edge models and the data , phased with the 48.36 d period , is shown in fig .",
    "[ knifeedge ] .",
    "a standard limb - darkening law , @xmath5 with @xmath6 , appropriate to a star of effective temperature 4000 k , was assumed @xcite .",
    "the shape of the model light curve is quite insensitive to the value of @xmath7 .",
    "it derives primarily from the geometric feature that near the halfway point the edge is cutting longer chords of the star .",
    "it is important to note that the duration of ingress and egress are much longer than the expected transit time ( @xmath00.5 d ) of an object on a keplerian orbit about the star with a period of 48 or 97 days .    during totality , which lasts about 18 days",
    ", the system is still visible , but at about 5% of its out - of - eclipse intensity .",
    "the spectrum and color ( fig .",
    "[ color ] ) during this time indicate that we are seeing reflected starlight from the circumstellar matter . the knife - edge model ( fig .",
    "[ knifeedge ] ) includes this component as a constant addition at all phases .",
    "in fact , the  central \" reversals and short time scale fluctuations during minima indicate that variable amounts of reflected light are present .",
    "more detailed modeling and , in particular , polarization measurements should ultimately provide important constraints on the detailed distribution of circumstellar matter . the fact that successive ingress and egress data do not match precisely indicates that there are fine scale opacity variations in the edge itself .",
    "it is also likely that the stellar surface is inhomogeneous to some extent , since stars of this mass and age commonly have dark ( magnetic ) or bright ( accretion ) spots .",
    "detailed photometric and spectroscopic monitoring during ingress or egress should reveal much about the structural and optical properties of the obscuring matter and perhaps also the stellar surface .",
    "optical photometry in bluer bands ( b , v and r ) was obtained at a number of phases , permitting us to study the color behavior of the star .",
    "these data indicate , remarkably , that there is no reddening of the star , even as it fades by more than 3 magnitudes ( see fig .",
    "[ color ] ) .",
    "this means the eclipsing object is , indeed , a very sharp knife - edge with no detectable optically thin transition zone or that the optically thin  atmosphere \" is devoid of small dust grains ( which invariably produce reddening in the interstellar medium ) . during minimum",
    "there is large scatter in the color data , owing to the faintness of the star , but the median color is bluer by @xmath00.1 mag than when out of eclipse .",
    "this presumably indicates that at least some small dust grains are present in the circumstellar matter and that we are seeing the star partly or entirely by scattered radiation near minimum light .",
    "there are real variations by up to 20% in the brightness of the star which occur on time scales as short as one hour during minima , indicative of changing orientations of the star and scattering clouds .",
    "the short time scales imply length scales for the variable features of less than 0.01 au , or one solar diameter , assuming they are in keplerian orbits with periods of 48 or 97 d.    in an attempt to detect the circumstellar matter of kh 15d by its emission , we have obtained near - infrared and millimeter wavelength observations of the star at the infrared telescope facility in hawaii and the owens valley radio observatory millimetre - wave array in california , respectively .",
    "the near - infrared ( jhkl ) colors both in and out of eclipse are consistent with an unreddened k7 star exhibiting no infrared excess attributable to a disk .",
    "the mm wavelength observations did not detect a source at the optical position .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these results provides a strong constraint on the possible mass of a disk .",
    "the upper limit on the mm emission translates to a mass limit of about 7 earth masses of dust at a temperature of about 500 k , while the lack of detectable infrared excess may simply reflect the fact that the putative disk is practically edge - on and opaque at these wavelengths .",
    "spectra with a resolution of @xmath040000 covering the range 478 - 690 nm were obtained on three nights with the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory on mt .",
    "paranal in chile .",
    "spectra were obtained on ut 29 nov ( just prior to ingress ) , 14 dec ( near central minimum ) , and 20 dec ( during the early part of egress ) , 2001 .",
    "a full account of the information contained in these data will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "they show , however , that the spectrum during eclipse is basically an attenuated version of the bright state , except for the emission lines .",
    "near minimum and during egress , the h@xmath8 equivalent width is substantially larger ( @xmath030 and 50  , respectively ) than when the star is at maximum light ( @xmath02  ) . essentially , the spectrum makes a transition from one characteristic of non - accreting or low accretion rate `` weak - lined '' t tauri stars to one characteristic of `` classical '' t tauri stars ( ctts ) , objects with clear evidence for active accretion of gas from a circumstellar disk . in particular , broad wings , extending to several hundred km s@xmath9 are seen on the h@xmath8 ( and h@xmath10 ) lines during minimum light and during egress , indicating that the star may still be in an active accretion stage .    a cross - correlation of the 29 nov and 20 dec spectra yields a radial velocity difference ( in the sense nov .",
    "minus dec . ) for the star between those two dates of + 3 @xmath111 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the interpretation of this result is complicated by the fact that the line profiles change shape during the eclipse , presumably due to the selective elimination of direct radiation from parts of the star s surface as well as an increased contribution of scattered light to the spectrum .",
    "@xcite will explore these issues further .",
    "here we note that , if the k7 star were orbiting the center of mass of the system with a 48.36 d period in response to a planet embedded in the obscuring matter , it would have yielded a _ negative _",
    "value for the velocity difference on those dates .",
    "therefore , assuming that the line profile effects are small , we can place a limit of @xmath010 jupiter masses on any mass associated with a single obscuring clump orbiting with a 48 d period . with only three spectra currently available we can not , of course , rule out the possibility of additional significant mass(es ) in the system orbiting with a 97 d ( or other ) period .",
    "however , there is no evidence in the spectrum for such a companion so it is unlikely to be comparable in mass to the visible k7 star .",
    "a radial velocity study spanning at least one season with a precision of at least 1 km s@xmath9 is clearly required and is underway in collaboration with g. marcy of u.c .",
    "kh 15d is a unique and amazing object that promises to tell us much about conditions in the inner circumstellar region of a solar - like star of planet - forming age .",
    "the principle purpose of this contribution is to summarize the available observations of the star with the hope of stimulating additional observations , and to support those by providing an updated ephemeris and description of the phenomena .",
    "however , a brief discussion of possible models is in order , based on the information currently available .",
    "these fall into two categories , depending on whether the k7 star is the dominant mass in the system or not . if it is , then the basic model involves occulting matter orbiting the star .",
    "if it is not ( i.e. if kh 15d is a binary star system and the unseen component has a mass comparable to or larger than the k7 star ) , then the observed phenomena could be caused wholly or in part by the motion of the visible star with respect to a circumbinary disk .",
    "we discuss the `` single star '' interpretation first , noting that it also applies to binary models in which the k7 star is the dominant mass .    assuming that the eclipse is caused by a feature or features orbiting the k7 star with a period of 48 or 97 days",
    ", we can apply kepler s third law to derive a semi - major axis for the orbit of the occulting matter of 0.21 or 0.32 au , respectively .",
    "therefore , if this model is correct , we are probing a region of the circumstellar environment closer to the star than mercury is to the sun .",
    "the occulting feature appears to have a very sharp edge , such that a knife - edge model fits the data well .",
    "however , the transit time for an object orbiting at 0.2 - 0.3 au from the k7 star is only @xmath00.5 d , much less than the time of ingress or egress ( @xmath02 - 2.5 d ) .",
    "therefore , if the star is eclipsed by a sharp - edged orbiting feature , its occulting edge must be inclined by about 15@xmath12 to its direction of motion .",
    "a sketch of what this would look like during the early stages of ingress is shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] . such an eclipsing structure could be caused by density waves or a corrugation of a disk driven by an embedded planet or brown dwarf , as @xcite for example , have modeled .",
    "alternatively , the features could be associated with a resonance of a yet undetected mass . during the eclipse ,",
    "the system is seen primarily or entirely by reflected light from the circumstellar matter .",
    "models such as these have many attractive features , including the potential to explain the central reversal as back scattering off the wave on the far side of the star or as a local minimum in the opacity near the location of an embedded planet or proto - planet .    if kh 15d is a binary in which the k7 star moves substantially with respect to the center of mass of the system , then an entirely different explanation of the observed phenomena is possible .",
    "namely , one could imagine the k7 star passing above ( and , possibly , alternately below ) the plane of an occulting ( presumably circumbinary ) disk .",
    "in other words , it would be primarily the motion of the star , in this model , that was causing the eclipse , not the motion of the occulting matter .",
    "as noted previously , this appears less likely at present for two reasons .",
    "first , there is only evidence for a single stellar spectrum from the system at any phase , even when the photosphere of the k7 star is completely occulted .",
    "second , there is very little difference in the radial velocity of the k7 stars on two dates separated by 21 d. neither of these arguments is sufficient , however , to rule out a binary model .",
    "for example , if the visible k7 star were on an eccentric orbit about a slightly more massive star and the orbit was properly inclined to the plane of a circumbinary disk , one could reproduce most or all of the observations , including the central peaks and the ingress / egress time scales . a comprehensive radial velocity study , as is under way , is clearly required to make progress .",
    "we note that , regardless of whether kh 15d proves to be a single or binary star , its unique orientation provides us with a powerful tool for studying the structure and evolution of circumstellar matter close to a young star on an unprecedented fine scale .",
