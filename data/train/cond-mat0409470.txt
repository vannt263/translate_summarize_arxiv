    "in a previous paper@xcite ( hereafter referred to as i ) , we described the physics of two - dimensional superfluids in the vicinity of a localization transition into a commensurate mott insulator .",
    "our primary focus was on bosons on the square lattice , and we demonstrated the role played by the projective transformations ( the psg ) of the vortices in the superfluid under operations of the square lattice space group .",
    "the present paper will extend our analysis to paired electron models on the square lattice , with the aim of justifying applicability to the cuprate superconductors .",
    "a simple physical argument based on universality was given in i clearly validating that analysis when the superconducting state neighboring the mott insulator is an @xmath5-wave state with a large quasiparticle gap , and it was claimed that the same description also holds for a similarly gapped `` strong pairing '' @xmath6-wave state . in this paper , we back up this claim with detailed microscopic analysis of a set of models that incorporate local singlet formation . specifically , we find that most of the results of i can be applied essentially unchanged , with the psg determined by the particle density of cooper pairs .",
    "we will also discuss the extent to which our results can be applied to `` weak pairing '' @xmath6-wave superconductors with gapless nodal quasiparticles .",
    "most of our analysis here will be carried out in the context of the quantum dimer model .",
    "this model was proposed by rokhsar , kivelson , and fradkin @xcite as an effective theory of the @xmath3 excitations of the insulating , paramagnetic phases of square lattice antiferromagnets . for generic parameters ,",
    "the insulating dimer model has a ground state which breaks the symmetry of the square lattice space group with the development of valence bond solid ( vbs ) order @xcite .",
    "the dimer model was also extended @xcite to allow for @xmath3 charged excitations : the hilbert space was expanded to include bosonic holes with density @xmath2 , and it was argued that the ground state is a superfluid at finite @xmath2 ( the pairing symmetry of this superconducting state is somewhat unclear in these works , and will be clarified below ) .",
    "the doped quantum dimer model is therefore ideally suited to our primary purpose here of describing the evolution from the vbs mott insulator to the superfluid as a function of increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we will begin in section  [ sec : dimer ] by reviewing the formulation @xcite of the quantum dimer model as a compact u(1 ) gauge theory ( with gauge field @xmath7 ) in the presence of a background static matter field of charges @xmath8 on the two sublattices of the square lattice . upon doping",
    ", the holes appear as two @xmath3 dynamic bose fields @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is a square lattice site index and the index @xmath11 labels the sublattice upon which the boson primarily resides ) .",
    "these bosons have charges @xmath12 under the compact u(1 ) gauge field @xmath7 .    in section  [ sec : spinful ]",
    "we show how the above theory of the spin @xmath3 sector can be extended to include @xmath0 fermionic excitations @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is a spin label ) .",
    "these fermionic ` spinons ' also carry unit staggered charges under the compact u(1 ) gauge field @xmath7 .",
    "while these fermionic excitations are gapped and confined in the undoped insulator , the structure of our theory allows these fermions to become gapless quasiparticles at nodal points in a possible @xmath6-wave superconducting ground state at finite @xmath2 : they then become the conventional @xmath0 bogoliubov quasiparticles of this superconductor . with this construction",
    ", we can directly discuss the pairing symmetry of the superfluid states of the doped dimer model .",
    "we will also consider collective @xmath4 ` triplon ' excitations in section  [ sec : triplon ] .",
    "so far we have mainly defined the degrees of freedom of our theory on the lattice scale , but this generally does not specify its ultimate ground state or the quantum numbers of its quasiparticles . in particular , we are considering a strongly interacting 2 + 1 dimensional compact u(1 ) gauge theory , and the non - perturbative fluctuations of @xmath7 must be treated with great care . generally , for the dimer models we consider here , these fluctuations drive confinement at long scales .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to initially neglect gauge fluctuations and to consider mean - field saddle points with a fixed background @xmath7 .",
    "such saddle points describe ( unstable ) ` spin liquid ' states , which may be considered the progenitors of the superconducting and/or charge ordered mott phases which appear as ground states .",
    "a subsequent treatment of gauge fluctuations describes this evolutionary descent via confinement or the higgs mechanism .",
    "remarkably , we will find in section  [ sec : conn - slave - part ] that , at least at the level of psgs , the spin liquid saddle points of the dimer model are related to particular ( generalized ) saddle points of earlier slave - particle u(1 ) ( refs .  ) or su(2 ) ( ref .  ) gauge theories .",
    "the particular saddle points appropriate to dimer models , however , are distinct from those advocated as candidate spin liquid states in the slave particle work .",
    "they have appeared  without much attention  in wen s psg classification of symmetric spin liquids @xcite ( the specific identifications of these spin liquids appear at the end of section  [ sec : conn - slave - part ] ) .",
    "our work thus resolves one question posed in ref .",
    ", as to how the ( putative ) spin liquid states of the quantum dimer model fit into this classification scheme . beyond classification , the physical interpretation we shall give to our dimer model saddle points , and our subsequent non - perturbative treatment of gauge fluctuations , lead us eventually to conclusions on the physical properties of our theory which differ from those reached in refs .  .",
    "there is one situation in which it is clear that the @xmath7 gauge fluctuations are relatively innocuous .",
    "this is the moderate @xmath2 state in which the @xmath9 are strongly condensed and the square lattice symmetry is fully preserved : the condensate acts like a higgs field which quenches @xmath7 fluctuations .",
    "such a state is a superconductor , and we will show in section  [ sec : superc - state ] that microscopic energetic considerations and the psg constrain the pairing symmetry of the superconductor ; @xmath6- and @xmath5- wave ( and other ) pairings emerge under suitable conditions .",
    "so what is the fate of this putative @xmath6-wave superconductor as @xmath2 is reduced ? as noted above , we know from refs .   that strong @xmath7 fluctuations produce a vbs insulator at @xmath1 , and so a careful treatment of @xmath7 fluctuations must surely become increasingly important as @xmath2 is reduced . in previous work@xcite on u(1 ) slave particle and related theories ,",
    "the evolution between a finite @xmath2 @xmath6-wave superconductor and a vbs insulator at @xmath1 was addressed in a mean - field theory ( similar to that just discussed above ) but which also allowed for breaking of the square lattice symmetry by the development of density wave / vbs order coexisting with superfluidity .",
    "this had the advantage of explicitly displaying the evolution of the gapless fermionic nodal quasiparticle excitations with decreasing @xmath2 : the nodes present at larger @xmath2 disappeared ( due to collisions in pairs at the ( reduced ) brillouin zone boundaries ) at a critical doping @xmath15 , larger than the doping @xmath16 at which the mott transition occurs .",
    "for small enough @xmath17 , a fully - gapped insulating vbs state was obtained .",
    "however , this work treated gauge or vbs fluctuations in a cavalier manner , and the vbs order was static and likely overestimated in magnitude .    in the application to the cuprates , we have in mind that these insulating or supersolid states obtained in our theory at finite doping are models of the situation near doping @xmath18 .",
    "there is much experimental evidence ( _ e.g. _ in la@xmath19nd@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath22 in ref .  )",
    "that exactly at @xmath18 the superconductivity is strongly suppressed , and perfect long - range order with a period of 4 lattice spacings develops ( as is also the case in fig  [ fig : h=0.0625 ] ) .    in section",
    "[ sec : dimerdual ] , we will address the @xmath2 driven evolution from a vbs insulator to a superconductor in an approach which fully accounts for the non - perturbative effects of the fluctuations of @xmath7 .",
    "no previous analysis @xcite has accounted for strong gauge fluctuations in this regime .",
    "however , we will only be able to do this in the context of the @xmath3 model of section  [ sec : dimer ] : non - zero @xmath23 excitations will be neglected in section  [ sec : dimerdual ] .",
    "while this is probably safe within the phases obtained therein , neglect of gapless nodal @xmath0 fermionic excitations is likely invalid at the quantum critical points .",
    "a full treatment which synthesizes the results of sections  [ sec : spinful ] and  [ sec : dimerdual ] , and thus accounts for _ both _ strong @xmath7 fluctuations and gapless @xmath0 fermions at quantum critical points is not available , and remains a challenging and important open problem .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath3 sector in section  [ sec : dimerdual ] is carried out by a duality mapping into a theory of vortices .",
    "the resulting effective theory for the vortices has a structure similar to the models considered in i , and can therefore be similarly classified by an analysis of the action of the psg on the vortices . with the knowledge of the psg ,",
    "many of the results of i can be directly applied here .",
    "we will also present in section  [ sec : dimermft ] a mean - field analysis of the dual vortex theory which results in a phase diagram of the dimer model as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to note that this dual mean - field theory accounts for non - perturbative confining effects of the @xmath7 fluctuations : these are built into the duality mapping .",
    "this section describes the doped quantum dimer model @xcite , viewed as an effective theory of the spin @xmath3 sector of doped quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "the resulting theory will be a compact u(1 ) gauge theory @xcite coupled to two classes of matter fields : ( _ i _ ) _ static _ charges of @xmath8 on the two sublattices , and ( _ ii _ ) _ dynamic _ bosons of charges @xmath8 with a total physical density @xmath2 ( note : bosons of both gauge charges contribute a positive number to the physical density ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dimer model can be written as @xmath24 the first term , @xmath25 involves a diagonal energy and a resonance of dimers on a plaquette , as illustrated in fig  [ dimer]a .     in eq .",

    "( _ b _ ) hopping of a hole with the amplitude @xmath26 term in eq .",
    "( [ barht ] ) . the hole ( represented by the open circle ) prefers to reside on one sublattice .",
    "this hole is on the `` wrong '' sublattice ( with high energy cost ) in the intermediate state above , which only acts as a technical tool for effectively generating the same sublattice hopping in the low energy limit .",
    "the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) is obeyed on all sites in all the states shown.,width=288 ]    following ref .  , and the notation of ref .",

    "the hamiltonian for dimers on a plaquette is @xmath32 note that the co - efficient of the cosine has the `` wrong '' sign .",
    "this is a consequence of the microscopics of the electrons in the @xmath26-@xmath33 model , if one adopts the natural sign convention that a singlet dimer is created by an electron pair - field operator ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairfield ] ) ) , and a given dimer covering corresponds to a product of such operators acting on the vacuum .",
    "the next two terms , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , describe the hopping of holes in the doped dimer model , as illustrated in fig  [ dimer]b . to maintain the description in terms of nearest neighbor dimers , the holes must hop between sites on the same sublattice .",
    "consequently , the model has two species of holes , one for each sublattice . this same - sublattice hole hopping model is somewhat inconvenient to work with under the duality mapping , and so we expand the hilbert space of the model by additional high energy states to allow us to express all hole motion in terms of nearest neighbor hopping : we allow each hole species to temporarily hop onto the `` wrong '' sublattice in a state which has a large energy",
    ". this hole will quickly hop back onto the `` right '' sublattice , and the two hop process will have achieved the same sublattice hopping we are seeking to model .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig  [ dimer]b ; the same strategy was used by moessner _",
    "@xcite in their study of the doped dimer model .",
    "we represent the two species of holes by the rotor phases @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the conjugate number variables @xmath38 , @xmath39 . the commutation relations are @xmath40 = i \\delta_{ij } \\delta_{\\sigma\\sigma'}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "these holes reside primarily on the @xmath42 or @xmath43 sublattices and will have opposite gauge charges .",
    "the potential energy of the holes is described by @xmath34 : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the hole self repulsion , @xmath46 is the average hole density preferred by the chemical potential ( we are working at fixed chemical potential , and the actual density , @xmath2 , in the ground state of the hamiltonian may be different ) , @xmath47 on the two sublattices , and @xmath48 is the energy penalty for a hole to be on the `` wrong '' sublattice . for @xmath49 , the @xmath42 holes are preferred on the @xmath50 sublattice , and the @xmath43 holes on the other .",
    "the off - site interaction energy @xmath51 is assumed to be repulsive , and is required to stabilize insulating states away from zero doping .",
    "we will discuss the case of general @xmath51 , although our numerical results later will be restricted to short - range @xmath51 ; long - range coulomb interactions lead only to minor modifications .",
    "the total density of holes on site @xmath10 is given by @xmath52 the nearest neighbor hopping hamiltonian for the two hole species is @xmath53    finally , there is a local constraint , which commutes with all the terms in the hamiltonian , @xmath54 this constraint ensures that there is either a hole on each lattice site or a dimer emerging from it .",
    "it also allows for a configuration with two dimers emerging from that site if the extra gauge charge is compensated by an additional hole from the `` wrong '' sublattice .",
    "this is the intermediate state in fig  [ dimer]b which compared with the other two states in that figure requires the excitation energy @xmath55 .",
    "we see that for sufficiently large @xmath56 we can safely set @xmath57 equal to zero and still pay a price for having a hole on the `` wrong '' sublattice .",
    "choosing both @xmath56 and @xmath58 sufficiently large also excludes unphysical states with even larger excitation energies .",
    "note that all the states in fig  [ dimer ] obey eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) .    we have already noted that the dimer resonance term in eq .",
    "( [ barhd ] ) has the opposite sign from that usually found for the maxwell term in lattice gauge theories .",
    "we will see below that this can have significant consequences for the physics , and hence the structure of the dual theory . physically , the kinetic term in eq .",
    "( [ barhd ] ) favors an average @xmath59 flux per plaquette in the gauge field @xmath27 .",
    "the hole propagation term , eq .  ( [ barht ] ) , however , clearly allows holes to achieve lower kinetic energy if this flux is expelled . since the gauge field is dynamical , the system will choose for itself what flux penetrates each plaquette on average , based on a balance of these two competing energies , and as pointed out by kivelson and fradkin@xcite , the flux will penetrate at @xmath1 and be expelled for large enough @xmath2 . in a strongly confining phase , as occurs for @xmath1 , however , this flux has no physical significance , since the gauge field is strongly fluctuating .",
    "mathematically , one may choose to view either the zero or @xmath59 flux states as vacua , provided fluctuations of this flux are included .",
    "in particular , one may attempt to fix the sign `` problem '' ( @xmath60 ) by shifting the gauge field @xmath27 on certain links by @xmath59 .",
    "however , this has the effect of inducing a @xmath59 flux per plaquette in the motion of the @xmath61 holes in eq .",
    "( [ barht ] ) .",
    "if we were to perform such a transformation , @xmath25 and @xmath35 would be replaced by @xmath62 @xmath63 and the holes now move in a magnetic field @xmath64 which obeys @xmath65 with @xmath66 .    for ( most of ) our purposes , it will generally not be advantageous to make such a shift .",
    "this is physically because our description of the mott transition approaches the critical point from the superconducting side , in terms of the condensation of vortices of the superconducting state . as discussed above , in the large @xmath2 region of the dimer model where superconductivity occurs ,",
    "zero flux is favored .",
    "hence this is a more natural point from which to embark upon our ( dual ) investigation .    in the following section , however , in which we discuss quasiparticle physics and pairing symmetry",
    ", we will consider the physical content of this @xmath59-flux background . our intuition to expand around the zero flux configuration",
    "is there confirmed , as we show that the @xmath59-flux background is inconsistent with @xmath6-wave ( or @xmath5-wave ) pairing in the superconductor , and applies instead to a yet more unconventional state .",
    "in the context of the cuprates , a shortcoming of the present approach ",
    "intrinsic to the dimer model  is the neglect of fermionic spin - carrying quasiparticles . to understand the nature of this difficulty",
    "more deeply , we discuss the results of a natural extension of the dimer approach to include these @xmath0 fermionic excitations .",
    "the dimer model can also be extended to include collective @xmath4 ` triplon ' excitations , but we defer discussion of these to section  [ sec : triplon ] , until after we have performed a duality analysis of the @xmath3 dimer model in section  [ sec : dimerdual ] .",
    "readers mainly interested in the duality analysis of the @xmath3 dimer model at finite doping may skip ahead to section  [ sec : dimerdual ] , and return to the present section upon a second reading .    the strategy will be to first understand in more detail the nature of the insulating states of this model when _",
    "undoped_. because in this model at half - filling all the `` matter '' ( holes and fermions ) is gapped , the polyakov argument implies that the u(1 ) gauge theory must be in a confining phase . nevertheless , it is instructive to consider formally the limit of weak gauge fluctuations , which in practice applies for large @xmath33  of either sign",
    ". then one may view the insulator as a gapped u(1 ) state plus gauge fluctuations , the latter  more specifically monopole proliferation  ultimately leading to confinement on long length scales , and with it , density wave order .",
    "this view has the advantage that the superconducting state can be seen as a `` higgs '' phase obtained from the u(1 ) state .",
    "further , the insulator can be characterized by a psg , defining the manner in which the physical symmetries are realized in the gauge theory . here",
    "we will consider two such psgs , which correspond naturally to the phases obtained for large positive and negative @xmath33 .",
    "we can better understand in this manner the nature of the superconducting and insulating states in this model .",
    "we will see that the former should be understood as a `` molecular '' or `` strong pairing '' d - wave phase .",
    "the latter can be seen to arise from either of two natural underlying u(1 ) spin liquid states .",
    "these two u(1 ) states are distinct , and characterized by different psgs .",
    "they are , however , both unstable at low energies to the various charge ordered states discussed herein .",
    "we proceed with a multi - pronged attack .",
    "first , we describe the symmetry of the bosonic dimer+hole hamiltonian of sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] .",
    "we consider the two distinct cases in which the ground state has an average zero or @xmath59 gauge flux per plaquette .",
    "these two cases give rise to distinct psgs which describe different putative insulating states . with this in hand",
    ", we discuss the nature of the pairing symmetry of superconducting states obtained from this model .",
    "next , we will augment the dimer+hole hilbert space by allowing each site to contain an unpaired electron ( or spin ) , in addition to the end of a dimer or the hole allowed up to now .",
    "physical arguments give the general form of the hamiltonian with such unpaired electrons included .",
    "this form is further restricted by combining the psgs of the dimer+hole model and the requirement that physical electrons transform properly .",
    "we discuss how this analysis is related to slave particle formulations of mott insulating states and wen s analysis @xcite of their psgs . with",
    "the full form of the dimer+hole+electron hamiltonian determined , we confirm the symmetry analysis of the superconducting states by a direct investigation of the effective bogoliubov - degennes quasiparticle hamiltonian .",
    "it is clear that , even without including fermionic excitations , the dimer model in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] already requires a non - trivial projective realization of certain symmetry operations of the space group .",
    "this is so because the staggered static gauge charges ( and the staggered potential term @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hh ] ) ) navely break lattice symmetries . to overcome this ,",
    "unit translations and @xmath67 rotations about a dual lattice site must be accompanied by the transformations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 to leave the dimer model invariant .",
    "actually , it will prove useful to discuss projective symmetries with respect to a fixed average background u(1 ) flux .",
    "this will make contact with wen s notion of projective symmetry analysis of slave particle saddle points .",
    "we will consider the two cases of zero and @xmath59 average flux per plaquette .    for compactness",
    ", we will in this section denote the boson operators by @xmath72 further , it is sometimes helpful to take the limit @xmath73 , corresponding to a `` microscopic '' dimer+hole model in which two holes of course can not occupy the same site . in this case",
    "the type @xmath74 holes live only on the @xmath75 sublattice , and conversely the type @xmath76 holes live only on the opposite @xmath77 sublattice .",
    "one then defines a single boson field via @xmath78 i.e. @xmath79 if @xmath10 is on the @xmath12 sublattice . for @xmath73 ,",
    "all finite energy states can be described in terms of the @xmath80 operator . for @xmath81 ,",
    "this is not the case , but @xmath80 defined as above is still useful and represents properly the low energy hole degrees of freedom .",
    "first , and simplest , is the case of zero flux , the nave choice for @xmath82 ( note that which saddle point is chosen by the system is however a dynamical question , which will in general depend upon all the degrees of freedom , and may vary as other parameters in the hamiltonian are varied ) . in this case",
    ", one can easily see that the only non - trivial _ required _ aspect of transformations of the bosons is the interchange of the two boson flavors  and associated change of the sign of gauge fields  for space group operations that interchange the two sublattices .",
    "specifically , these are unit translations ( or generally translations by an odd number of total lattice units ) , @xmath67 rotations about a dual lattice site , and inversions through a row / column of the dual lattice . however , there is a mathematical freedom to compose each space group operation with a global u(1 ) phase rotation .",
    "that is , for an operation which preserves the two sublattices , one may take a priori @xmath83 similarly , for an operation that interchanges the two sublattices , @xmath84 using the definition eq .",
    "( [ eq : bslave ] ) , both these equations are replaced simply by @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the site @xmath10 is mapped to under the space group operation @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the phase , which we take as _ the same _ for both boson flavors , and can be chosen differently for each @xmath87 .",
    "note that this phase rotation is not a u(1 ) gauge rotation ( which would be opposite for the two boson flavors ) unless @xmath89 .",
    "since the hole fields are not themselves physical , it is not a priori obvious which value of @xmath88 is the _ correct _ one .",
    "an important constraint on @xmath88 is that any sequence of space group operations which compose to the trivial identity operation in the original space group should compose to a pure gauge u(1 ) transformation in the psg .",
    "the square of an inversion or the fourth power of a @xmath67 rotation must be a pure u(1 ) gauge transformation .",
    "hence the phase @xmath90 if @xmath91 is an inversion , while @xmath92 if @xmath93 is a @xmath67 rotation .",
    "other similar constraints can be applied with more detailed considerations .",
    "for the doped dimer model , we can further refine this by using the physical interpretation of the hole operators .",
    "consider the action of the physical singlet pair field operator on a bond : @xmath94 with @xmath95 . clearly , this operator , when acting on a state in which the bond in consideration is occupied by two holes , annihilates the holes and creates a dimer .",
    "hence we require @xmath96 here we have introduced two unknown coefficients , @xmath97 ( these are assumed independent of @xmath10 , as can be argued is generally true ) . to determine them , we use the known transformation properties of the pair field defined from eq .",

    "the consistency of our approach with the modulations observed in stm studies of the vortex lattice @xcite ( discussed above ) , and the absence ( so far ) of the staggered current patterns near vortices predicted by the su(2 ) gauge theory,@xcite may tentatively be regarded as experimental evidence in support of the approach advocated in i and the present paper .    while our duality analysis is best controlled when the fermionic @xmath0 quasiparticle excitations of the superconductor are fully gapped ,",
    "the structure of our theory does allow these quasiparticles to acquire a gapless nodal structure in a superconductor , without a strong qualitative impact on any of the phases of our theory .",
    "upon decreasing @xmath2 from deep in the superconducting state , such nodal quasiparticles can annihilate in pairs across a reduced brillouin zone boundary in a superconductor at @xmath15 , as has been described in previous work @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can imagine that the nodal quasiparticles persist in the superconducting phase right down to the mott insulator - to - superconductor transition : the theory of i will clearly not apply to such a transition , and obtaining the correct theory for this case remains an important open problem .",
