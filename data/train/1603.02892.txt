    "the occurrence of superconductivity in these borosilicide compounds brings to mind other well known boron - containing , phonon - mediated superconductors , including the borocarbides @xmath14b@xmath1c ( @xmath15 = rare - earth element , @xmath16 = ni , pd , pt ) @xcite and magnesium diboride mgb@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the observation of superconductivity in several examples of cr@xmath0b@xmath2-type compounds with the 512 stoichiometry suggests that further examination may produce more examples in this relatively new group of superconductors @xcite . in the present work ,",

    "the superconducting critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) is determined to be as high as 9.2k .",
    "this is the highest @xmath6 yet reported for superconductors in this structure type .",
    "in addition to measurements of resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , and heat capacity , we report results of first principles calculations that reveal the presence of multiple bands crossing the fermi level in this borophosphide and the related borosilicides , as seen in , for example , the iron - based superconductors including the phosphide lafepo @xcite , as well as mgb@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "magnetization measurements were performed with a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ) and physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the ppms was also used for measurements of electrical resistivity and heat capacity .",
    "the heat capacity data were analyzed using both the conventional relaxation method employing small heat pulses ( temperature rise of 2% of the sample temperature ) and slope - analysis @xcite of large heat pulse data ( temperature rise of 30% of the sample temperature ) .",
    "first principles density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of mo@xmath18pb@xmath19 were performed using the linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) code wien2k @xcite , employing the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke and ernzerhof @xcite .",
    "lapw sphere radii of 2.41 , 2.08 and 1.7 bohr , respectively for mo , p , and b were chosen with an rk@xmath24 of 7.0 , where rk@xmath24 is the product of the smallest sphere radius and the largest plane - wave expansion wavevector .",

    "this argues in favor of a phononic pairing mechanism .    the value of @xmath30 determined from the calculated band structure ( fig .",

    "this is significantly lower than the observed value of 3.16mj / mol - at./k@xmath31 .",

    "the energy zero is set to the fermi energies of the respective compounds .",
    ", width=288 ]    in general , such a reduced specific heat jump can result from two factors .",
    "the first of these is gap anisotropy , including nodal behavior as observed in the superconducting cuprates @xcite or more recently in lafepo , a structural relative of the high @xmath33 iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "for example , the bcs weak - coupling theory , applied to a single band two dimensional d - wave material @xcite , predicts a reduced specific heat jump @xmath32 of 0.95 .",
    "however , there is little evidence for nodal superconductivity in mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 .",
    "for example , the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state in figure [ fig : hc]b at 1.9 k , or approximately 20 percent of @xmath33 , is only 2 percent of the normal state value at @xmath33 , consistent with bcs predictions for a gapped s - wave superconductor .",
    "the second possibility for such a reduced specific heat jump is multiband superconductivity , as observed in mgb@xmath19 @xcite . strictly speaking",
    "this can be considered a form of anisotropy , but here we follow the historical context and treat it separately from the fermi surface gap anisotropy described above . in mgb@xmath1 , well established to be an intermediate coupling multiband s - wave superconductor @xcite , the largest specific heat jump @xmath34 was observed @xcite to be 1.32 , less than the bcs s - wave value .",
    "the band structure calculations for mo@xmath0pb@xmath1  support the possibility of multiband superconductivity , since several bands contribute significant dos at the fermi level .",

    "we depict the heat capacity data of mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 , along with two calculated curves : a single band bcs fit where the t=0 gap value has been taken as the canonical bcs weak - coupling value , 1.76 k@xmath35t@xmath36 , and a two band fit with two gaps .",
    "the smaller gap is weighted at one third the weight of the larger and the two gap fitting yields one gap of 0.65 times the bcs value and the other gap 1.12 times the bcs value .",
    "the relative weighting of the two band fit is in rough agreement with the highest two fermi - level dos values from the band structure calculations .",
    "experimental data from nb , which has a similar electron - phonon coupling @xmath11 as well as similar t@xmath36 , is included in in fig .",
    "[ fig : specfit ] for comparison .",
    "the data was taken from ref . .",
    "if mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 is a single band superconductor , as nb is known to be , one would expect a similar electronic specific heat curve .",
    "instead , one finds a specific heat jump @xmath34 only slightly above the weak coupling bcs value .",
    "in addition , the low - temperature specific heat is _ enhanced _ relative to the bcs value , as indicated in the inset .",
    "the low - t enhancement of the specific heat was found , in the case of mgb@xmath19 @xcite , to result from having one gap much smaller than the bcs value .",
    "often the specific heat at low temperature is taken to vary exponentially in @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the smallest energy gap in the system , but the data ( red diamonds ) in the logarithmic plot in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : specfit ] show a substantial curvature demonstrating excitations across at least two gaps .",
    "the two band fit significantly improves upon the bcs fit , generating better agreement at both low temperatures and temperatures near t@xmath36 , though measurements on single crystals would be desirable to support this .",
    "this is consistent with the electronic structure calculations , finding multiple bands crossing @xmath39 .",
    "it is of interest to compare the experimental and theoretical results for mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 to the isostructural compound mo@xmath0sib@xmath1 , which is itself a superconductor with a somewhat lower t@xmath36 of 5.8 k @xcite . from a comparison of our calculated @xmath30 of 1.22 mj / mol - atom - k@xmath31 for the si compound with the @xmath30 of 2.12 mj / mol - atom - k@xmath31 measured in ref .",
    ", an electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath40 of 0.73 is determined , significantly lower than the value of 1.0 we infer for the p compound .",
    "given that the debye temperatures of these two materials are quite similar , the lower value of @xmath11 for the si compound immediately translates to a lower @xmath6",
    ".    our calculations also provide insight into the source of this change in @xmath11 .",
    "presented in the inset of figure [ fig : theory]b are the calculated total densities - of - states of the two compounds in a window of width approximately 4 ev , centered on e@xmath41 .",
    "it is apparent that the densities - of - states can nearly be superimposed upon each other in a  rigid - band \" manner , with a shift of approximately 0.2 ev corresponding directly to the 2 fewer valence electrons of the si compound .",
    "since the calculated densities - of - states both generally increase with energy around the respective fermi energies , the effective hole doping associated with the substitution of si for p lowers the fermi level dos .",
    "we note that this dos reduction from 10.7 to 8.30 per ev per unit cell , or 22 percent , parallels the inferred 27 percent @xmath11 reduction from the p compound to the si compound .",
    "this suggests that the electron phonon matrix element v ( recalling that in bcs theory @xmath42 ) is similar in the two compounds , as is reasonable .",
    "in addition , the calculations are consistent with the observation that the p - rich sample mo@xmath0p@xmath7b@xmath8 has a higher @xmath6 than the mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 sample ( table [ tab : props ] ) , since the dos at @xmath43 ( fig . [",
    "fig : theory]b ) would be increased by the substitution of p for b.    our first principles calculations and analysis of the experimental data thus suggest that mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 is an intermediate coupling , phonon - mediated , and potentially multiband superconductor .",
    "we note that it is possible that the superconductors mo@xmath0sib@xmath1 and additionally nb@xmath0sib@xmath1 are also multiband materials as our calculations ( depicted in the appendix ) find each of these materials to have several bands crossing e@xmath41 .",
    "we have discovered a new superconductor , mo@xmath0pb@xmath1 , with critical temperature @xmath33 as high as 9.2 k. it crystallizes in a tetragonal cr@xmath0b@xmath2 structure shared by a number of superconductors , such as mo@xmath0sib@xmath1 and nb@xmath0sib@xmath1 , and w@xmath0sib@xmath1 , and has the highest transition temperature and upper critical field reported for this family of compounds .",
    "electron doping is may be expected to increase @xmath6 further .",
