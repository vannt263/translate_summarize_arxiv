    "in recent years non - equilibrium dynamics of cold atom systems has emerged as interesting problems , because the cold atom systems are ideally isolated systems which can be directly explored experimentally .",
    "recent rapid progress in manipulation techniques has enabled experimentalists to modify strength and sign of interaction between cold atoms by feshbach resonance @xcite , to make a spin - dependent trapping potential to trap the cold atoms of each spin separately , and to change the trapping potential suddenly to explore the dynamics of quantum quench .    of these experiments ,",

    "simulations are conducted in the one - dimensional system which consists of two - component fermions . in the system , at first",
    ", the fermions of each component are trapped by separate harmonic potentials .",
    "the trapping harmonic potentials have the same shape ( the cycle of motion of a fermion in the potential is @xmath2 ) , but they are spatially separated ( fig.[trap](a ) ) .",
    "the particle density has some peaks ( the number of peaks is the same as the particle number ) and has gaussian - like tails .",
    "then , we suddenly change the trapping potentials into a new shared potential ( we set this time @xmath3 ) .",
    "the new shared potential has the same shape as before , but its bottom is midway between the bottoms of the two initial trapping potentials ( fig.[trap](b ) ) .",
    "when the interaction between the two fermions is zero , each fermion cluster moves to the opposite side in the half cycle @xmath4 , without changing the shape of the particle number density . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interaction is finite , some particles are reflected and return to the initial side , and the others pass through and move to the opposite side ( fig.[action](a)(b ) ) . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the particle number density is nearly zero again at the center of the potential , so we can obtain the number of particles which return to the initial side ; this number is denoted by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the number of particles in the initial cluster ) .",

    "however the relations @xmath60 and @xmath61 are still observed .",
    "we assume a simple quasi - classical dynamics model to compare it with the calculation results .",
    "the assumption of the quasi - classical model is that the fermions in the clusters are independently localized in each position , and the collision dynamics is described by a series of one - to - one collisions between two wave packets of the independent fermions . under this assumption of `` quasi - classical independent collision '' , we can calculate quasi - classical reflectance @xmath62 only from the one - to - one collision reflectance @xmath48 ( by definition @xmath63 ) .",
    "we observe from this simple calculation that @xmath64 in the limit of @xmath50 .",
    "the reason is that a wave packet of a fermion collides @xmath7 times with fermions of the other spin , while it moves to the opposite side ( note that almost all probability amplitude of it reaches the opposite ) .",
    "therefore the total number of collisions is @xmath65 so the reflectance @xmath66 .",
    "this result is consistent with our simulation results by t - dmrg .",
    "in contrast , in the limit of @xmath55 , it is shown that @xmath67 and @xmath68 is independent of @xmath7 . in this limit",
    ", the particles are almost perfectly reflected by each other , so passing to the opposite side occurs only on the border between the two clusters . since the collision on the surface occurs just @xmath7 times , the transmittance @xmath69 .",
    "this result conflicts with our simulation with the quantum effects fully considered",
    ".    therefore the quasi - classical picture , `` quasi - classical independent collision '' , is not valid in the limit of @xmath55 , so a different picture to explain the results for @xmath55 is needed .",
    "since the particles are fermions , the maximum number of particles which share a site is just two .",
    "these results imply that the number of possible one - to - one collisions on the surface , which is @xmath65 , determines both the reflectance in the limit of @xmath50 and the transmittance in the limit of @xmath55 because of dynamically emerging quantum many - body effects .",
    "using the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method and the fermi  hubbard model , we calculate collision dynamics between two kinds of fermion clusters in both cases of weak and strong interaction .",
    "reflectance ( transmittance ) is in proportion to the particle number when the interaction is weak ( strong ) .",
    "at least in the two extremes , the cluster  cluster collision dynamics is mainly dependent on the number of possible one - to - one collisions .",
