    "a starred sum indicates that if a limit of summation is an integer , the corresponding summand is multiplied by @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath13 denotes @xmath14 .",
    "the van der corput transform is best - known in number theory for being the crucial element of process b in the theory of exponent pairs and is sometimes simply referred to as `` process b. '' as a method of estimating exponential sums , the van der corput transform is often presented alongside other methods of weyl , van der corput , and vinogradov .",
    "direct application of the van der corput transform can take a complicated sum to one more amenable to estimation techniques or it can reduce the number of terms and therefore make computational estimations easier .",
    "the van der corput transform itself is involutive  applying it to the right - hand side of will simply return the sum on the left - hand side of so one gains nothing by applying it twice in a row ; but one could alternate applications of the van der corput transform with other techniques ( such as the process a of the theory of exponent pairs ) to achieve better results .",
    "this alternation method is still a fruitful ground for modern research .",
    "recently , cellarosi @xcite attained interesting new results in the classical case of @xmath4 and @xmath15 , where the alternating technique employed is simply reducing @xmath16 modulo @xmath17 ; nakai @xcite has investigated the possibility of using an analogous method when @xmath18 is cubic or quartic .",
    "the van der corput transform has also seen recent use in physical applications , including quantum optics and wave processes ( see @xcite and the papers cited there for more details ) .",
    "van der corput @xcite originally showed that , given @xmath19,\\ ] ] the error term can be bounded like @xmath20 ( here we use the landau and vinodradov asymptotic notations which will be defined explicitly in section [ section : notation ] . )",

    "the form of the error term found in most modern texts on analytic number theory @xcite has its roots in the work of kolesnik @xcite and heath - brown @xcite , although the results of the latter authors required analyticity of the function @xmath2 , an assumption which has since been circumvented .",
    "this moderately - difficult - to - prove form of the error term suffices for many basic application of the van der corput transform .",

    "the error term @xmath31 here corresponds to the @xmath32 term in the estimates of van der corput and phillips .",
    "unfortunately , for many interesting cases , the above error is insufficient . as huxley @xcite notes , when applying the van der corput transform to a multi - dimensional exponential sum , `` ... the error terms and the truncation error in the poisson summation formula may add up to more than the estimate for the reflected sum . ''",
    "thus , finer error terms , useful for a broad spectrum of problems including computation and physical applications , have been given by various people , including kolesnik @xcite , liu @xcite , redouaby and sargos @xcite , and karatsuba and korolev @xcite .",

    "van der corput s results in @xcite also deserve a mention here , as they are of an entirely different flavor from those listed above and because they are generally not very well - known . instead of having a coefficient of @xmath47 in the transformed sum , he has a more general set of coefficients .",
    "in addition , his error term  which would require too many definitions to state succinctly here  bears no resemblance to any of the other error estimates cited or formulated in this paper .    while van der corput s results in @xcite are quite complicated to use , they are aesthetically pleasing .",

    "van der corput shows that the conditions are still satisfied and the error term unchanged regardless of which side one applies his transform to ; his _ theorem _ is involutive .",
    "the van der corput transform and its error has been studied in much more general settings than we go into here : of particular interest , jutila @xcite considered sums of the form @xmath48 for certain multiplicative functions @xmath49 ( see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "have given the error term in this case as an explicit integral .",
    "but perhaps most amazing are the results of coutsias and kazarinoff @xcite : they showed that for positive integers @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the nearest integer to @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is a particular constant . not only is the error bounded but it shrinks to zero as @xmath57 nears an integer .",
    "the coutsias - kazarinoff result suggests that the van der corput transform should be very accurate ; in particular , the van der corput transform for nice enough functions @xmath2 and @xmath1 should nt have compounding error terms ( such as the @xmath59 ) seen in all the other results mentioned above .    the main theorems of this paper ( and theorem [ thm : toinfinity ] , especially ) confirm this hypothesis , allowing the van der corput transform to be applied on very long intervals with a much higher degree of accuracy than in previous results .",
    "as a quick example of this , consider the following well - known transform which appears in iwaniec and kowalski s book @xcite ( a version of this transform also appears in @xcite ) .",

    "however , another result of redouaby and sargos provides an alternate bound for such an integral . under the conditions of lemma [ lem : redsar1 ] and the additional assumption that @xmath987 to simplify the error terms , we have the following result ( combining lemma 3 and lemma 9 in @xcite ) for @xmath988 : @xmath989 where @xmath990 , @xmath991 and @xmath992 denotes the modified fresnel integral function or @xmath993 where we have used @xmath994 and would further break the function up into its real and imaginary parts .",

    "let us assume once again that @xmath996 .",

    "@xmath25 is of order much larger than @xmath17 , and @xmath998 is of order much smaller than @xmath999 this in turn is useful to the van der corput transform if the good range for @xmath998 includes @xmath1000 , and this will be true provided @xmath1001 is of an order of magnitude much greater than @xmath1002 .    to apply these new estimates ,",
    "we need to make a few further small changes in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "first , for this @xmath172 , we do not change @xmath401 to @xmath1003 , removing the term @xmath1004 from @xmath1005 .",
    "second , since we only apply the above estimates to an integral on one side of @xmath10 , we obtain terms of size @xmath1006 from the terms now left uncancelled when we apply propositions [ prop : main1 ] and [ prop : main2 ] to the other side . finally , since we do not have any integral from @xmath401 to @xmath1003 in @xmath717 , all the associated terms no longer need to be bounded .",
    "if @xmath1007 , then this means we lack the term @xmath1008 as well as @xmath1009 and @xmath1010 .",
    "this thus removes the term with @xmath1011 from @xmath1012 , and reduces the last pair of terms in @xmath1013 to @xmath1014    when @xmath10 is not in the interval @xmath3 $ ] , say @xmath1015 , then we need to be slightly more careful . we will need to assume that condition @xmath231 holds on the larger interval @xmath1016 $ ] , and then consider the difference of integrals @xmath1017 we would apply propositions [ prop : main1 ] and [ prop : main2 ] to the first integral and the above estimates to the second",
