    "the physics of light hypernuclei has been the subject of many papers , and there is a renewed interest in recent months , see , for instance , @xcite and references therein . in this contribution , we wish to stress the possibility of borromean states such as the neutral @xmath5 with strangeness @xmath6 , which is more likely bound using the recent interaction models inspired by chiral effective field theory ( ceft ) than in more conventional models based on meson exchange and su(3 ) flavour symmetry .    after a brief reminder on the allowed window for borromean binding , we shall discuss the interaction models , present our results on light hypernuclei , and then suggest some reaction mechanisms to produce light hypernuclei .",
    "by a kind of miracle , , considered as @xmath7 is stable , though neither @xmath8{he}=(\\alpha , n)$ ] nor @xmath9 are bound . in quantum mechanics , this can be understood even without invoking 3-body forces .",
    "binding two bosons , for instance , with a short - range potential @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is attractive and @xmath12 , requires a minimal strength , say @xmath13 .",
    "there is also a threshold coupling @xmath14 for binding three bosons with the same interaction , @xmath15 , but the interesting observation is that @xmath16 !",
    "hence in the window @xmath17 , one gets 3-body binding without 2-body binding .",
    "this is implicit in the pioneering paper by thomas @xcite , who observed a large ratio of 3-body to 2-body binding energies for @xmath18 , and deduced a limit @xmath19mev on the range of nuclear forces before the discovery of the pion .",
    "the word `` borromean '' became popular in the context of halo nuclei @xcite and is now of current use .",
    "borromean binding is allowed in a limited range of couplings . for @xmath20 bosons ,",
    "one can demonstrate @xcite that the threshold coupling @xmath21 obey @xmath22 a system of unequal masses @xmath23 involves two couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which can be normalised so that @xmath26 corresponds to the coupling threshold for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 pairs , respectively , one can draw a map of the @xmath29 region for which borromean binding is not forbidden @xcite .",
    "one gets typically one third of the square @xmath30 allowed , so it is conceivable to get @xmath31 bound in some models where neither @xmath9 nor @xmath32 are stable .    in the case of a 4-body system with two different masses ,",
    "i.e. @xmath33 , there are three different couplings , @xmath24 , @xmath34 and @xmath25 .",
    "again , they can be normalised such that @xmath35 which is the coupling threshold for the @xmath36 pair . in @xcite and",
    "our recent study @xcite , the best frontier of the allowed region for binding inside the cube @xmath37 } is drawn",
    ". a large fraction of the cube @xmath38 can be eligible for borromean binding .",
    "this preliminary study provides some hopes for borromean binding of @xmath4[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}=(n , n,\\lambda,\\lambda)$ ] .",
    "atomic physics gives us some further encouragement to search for borromean 4-body systems . with a pure coulomb interaction ,",
    "the system of four unit charges @xmath39 remains bound against dissociation into two neutral atoms in the region of mass ratio @xmath40 ( or , of course , @xmath41 , although none of 3-body subsystems such as @xmath42 or @xmath43 are stable @xcite .",
    "a group of como @xcite has studied how the hydrogen atom , ions and molecules evolve when the coulomb interaction becomes screened : there is a domain of the screening parameter for which the hydrogen molecule remains stable while the hydrogen atom is unbound .",
    "the inequality , and the allowed domains in the case of unequal masses , are derived from a hall  post type of decomposition of the @xmath20-body hamiltonian in terms of @xmath44-body or @xmath45-body sub - systems , with proper removal of the centre - of - mass motion @xcite .",
    "hence , they are saturated in the case of a potential with an external barrier and an inner part that coincides with a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the chances of getting borromean binding decrease if the shape of the potential evolves towards a monotonic potential , and further decrease if the potential acquires an inner repulsive core of increasing size and strength @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , another point of view was adopted , not based on the shape of potential , but on its low - energy scattering properties .",
    "it was shown that for a given scattering length ( negative so that the 2-boson system is attractive without bound state ) , the borromean binding in the three - boson system depends dramatically on the effective range @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the curve giving the 3-body energy @xmath47 vs.  @xmath46 is almost universal , i.e. , independent of the shape of the potential .",
    "thus , for our purpose , it is extremely important to use toy potentials that fit accurately not only the scattering lengths but also the effective ranges .",
    "our study is devoted to light hypernuclei with mass number @xmath48 .",
    "the 2-body problem has been solved by standard techniques to fix the parameters of some simple potentials as to reproduce the deuteron binding energy , the scattering length and effective range of @xmath49 and @xmath0 provided by the nijmegen group and the bonn - jlich eft group .",
    "the 3-body problem has been solved in perimetric coordinates @xmath50 , etc . , using the variational wave function @xmath51~,\\ ] ] that is widely used in atomic physics . the permutation symmetry ,",
    "if any , can be checked _ a posteriori _ or imposed",
    "_ a priori _ assigning the same coefficient @xmath52 to several terms . to avoid instabilities in the variational optimisation , it is convenient to choose the inverse ranges @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in a geometric series , and thus to minimise only two parameters , given that the @xmath52 and the variational energy are computed from a simple eigenvalue equation .",
    "this is somehow similar to the method used by hiyama et al .",
    "@xcite for the gaussian expansion .    as a check",
    ", we also solve the 3-body problem by the method of gaussian expansion in the stochastic variant of suzuki and varga , using their computer code @xcite .",
    "this latter method was also applied to the 4-body systems .",
    "once again , our preliminary study is based on a kind of `` model of model '' , namely a simple potential that reproduce the low - energy properties of a more complicated model of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "a similar approach was used in refs .  @xcite . as a check , we reproduce the results of this latter group , but we note that the models they used , borrowed from the former reference , differ from ours .    more precisely , we adopted two sets of parameters , given in table  [ tab : para ] , the first one , labelled esc08 , corresponding to the nijmegen - riken group @xcite , the second one , labelled ceft , to refs .",
    "we also use standard values for @xmath56 in both spin @xmath57 and @xmath58 states ( not shown ) .    [",

    "the results are the following : + @xmath62 the deuteron @xmath63 is of course well reproduced once the low - energy parameters of @xmath56 are fitted .",
    "there are also other bound states with strangeness @xmath64 or @xmath6 .",
    "+ @xmath65 the @xmath66 system @xmath67 is bound in both models for isospin @xmath68 and spin @xmath69 , below the @xmath70 threshold .",
    "with ceft , the partner with @xmath68 and @xmath71 and the one with @xmath72 and @xmath69 are nearly bound .",
    "we do not find any binding for @xmath31 nor for @xmath73 , but we have not yet introduced any mixing with configurations involving @xmath74 or @xmath75 . + @xmath76 we agree with the conclusions of ref.@xcite regarding @xmath4[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}=(n , p,\\lambda,\\lambda)$ ] .",
    "our main concern is @xmath4[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}=(n , n,\\lambda,\\lambda)$ ] : this state is found unbound with esc08 , in agreement with @xcite . however , is at the edge of binding with ceft .",
    "for instance , if we simulate the low - energy parameters of the ceft column in table  [ tab : para ] by an exponential potential @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 properly tuned for each baryon - baryon pair in each spin state , we obtain a binding of about @xmath80mev for @xmath4[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}$ ] using about 80 terms ( plus the ones deduced by permutation ) in the gaussian expansion scheme  @xcite .",
    "several improvements might enforce or spoil the binding .",
    "in particular it would be desirable to push further the ceft calculations to test the stability in the 2-body sector and access to the 3-body forces .",
    "it is well - known that in the strangeness @xmath81 sector , 3-body forces are crucial to reproduce the properties of light nuclei .",
    "another concern is the neglect of tensor forces , which , in our approach , are replaced by a reinforcement of the effective central interaction .",
    "the validity of this approach was discussed many years ago and summarised in the textbook by blatt and weisskopf @xcite .",
    "it is argued that in the deuteron , the tensor forces couple d - states in the continuum to a system located at @xmath82mev , while in the triton , they couple the same continuum to a system lying at @xmath83mev .",
    "this explains while models with pure central forces simulate too much tensor interaction beyond the deuteron , and in particular , overbind the triton . in the case of ,",
    "e.g. , the @xmath1 interaction , the zero - energy where the scattering length and the effective range are fixed almost coincides with the energy of the very weakly bound states such as @xmath84 , and the tensor forces playing a comparable role in 2-body and few - body systems , can be mimicked more safely within the same central potential .",
    "a related important issue is the role of the couplings @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "part of it can be absorbed into an effective diagonal potential in the @xmath49 and @xmath0 channels . however , as stressed in the literature @xcite , the @xmath87 and @xmath88 channels sometimes open new isospin couplings within the hypernuclei , and this will lower the energy .",
    "the shape and the strength of the @xmath0 is intimately related to the existence of the @xmath89 dibaryon .",
    "the chromomagnetic binding of @xmath90 below the @xmath0 threshold was proposed by jaffe @xcite , with , however , some unjustified assumptions about the su(3 ) flavour symmetry and the short - range correlations in the 6-body system @xcite .",
    "many experiments have searched for the @xmath89 , without success .",
    "it remains that the chromomagnetic interaction at the quark level induces a short - range attraction between two @xmath0 , and it is interesting that this property is recovered in the ceft approach .",
    "if the @xmath0 system itself is not bound , the attraction might be sufficient to bind .",
    "several reactions have been used to produce double hypernuclei .",
    "one possibility is to use a @xmath91 exotic atom as initial state @xcite .",
    "another way is to consist of @xmath92 inelastic scattering on a light nucleus , with a recoiling system of strangeness @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of inclusive production in electron or hadron scattering .    in the case of the tetrabaryon @xmath94[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}$ ] , the exclusive reaction @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the deuteron , seems particularly promising @xcite .",
    "the leading mechanism is a virtual @xmath97 exchanged between the two protons .",
    "this means twice the reaction @xmath98 , whose cross - section is known .",
    "one can thus estimate rather safely the order of magnitude of the reaction , given the very low background .",
    "our estimate @xcite gives a cross - section of the order of @xmath99nb for an energy @xmath100gev .",
    "thus the reaction appears as an interesting tool to search for new hypernuclei .",
    "the recent studies of the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interaction indicates a significantly shorter range , as compared to the conventional approaches .",
    "this modifies the spectroscopy of light hypernuclei , and conversely , the study of light hypernuclei can probe the new models of baryon  baryon interaction .",
    "we presented here the first results of a study restricted to simple pairwise potentials that reproduce the low - energy properties of each baryon - baryon pair . in the case",
    "where the potentials are tuned to reproduced the low - energy scattering parameters of chiral effective field theory , there are indications that the tetrabaryon @xmath4[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}=(n , n,\\lambda,\\lambda)$ ] might be bound .",
    "if so , this would be a fully borromean system whose 2-body as well as 3-body sub - systems are unbound",
    ". the role of 3-body forces and the changes induced by the coupling of @xmath49 to @xmath87 and of @xmath0 to @xmath88 will be the subject of further investigations .",
