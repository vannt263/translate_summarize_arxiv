    "we fit the log - linear model ( see equation  [ eq : mlpowlaw ] ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 the full rb02 data set contains some small groups which can be influential in the estimation of the slope , @xmath56 .",

    "close to the flux limit for selection , any x - ray selected sample will preferentially include the most luminous sources for a given mass .",

    "( the inferred intrinsic dispersion may be artificially reduced or increased , depending on the distribution of data with respect to the flux limit . ) the use of the extended sample of rb02 , rather than only their flux - limited hiflugcs sample , partially mitigates this effect by softening the flux limit .",
    "furthermore , we eliminate the 6 clusters at redshifts @xmath70 which all lie close to the flux limit ; as figure  [ fig : ml_z_x1 ] shows , the extent in luminosity of the remaining 86 clusters is roughly a decade at all redshifts . as our estimate ( see below ) of the intrinsic scatter in @xmath59 is roughly 0.12 ( _ i.e. _ 0.12 decades in luminosity ) , and the poisson measurement error is much smaller , we expect the effects of malmquist bias on our estimation of the power - law slope and intrinsic dispersion to be minimal .     is defined in equation  [ eq : mlmodel2 ] and is computed in our reference cosmology .",
    "the data from rb02 which are excluded from the analysis ( see text ) , are shown as blue triangles .",
    "the remaining clusters have an extent of roughly one decade in luminosity at all redshifts . ]    a second consequence of malmquist bias is a strong apparent , but not necessarily physical , correlation between luminosity and redshift due to the fact that the flux limit corresponds to higher luminosities at higher redshifts .",
    "( this is evident in figure  [ fig : ml_z_x1 ] . ) within redshift 0.11 , we expect this false signal to be much greater than any real evolution ; we therefore fix @xmath71 when fitting the model .",
    "although methods exist for performing linear regression on data with bivariate heteroscedastic errors and intrinsic scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such methods do not provide a simple goodness - of - fit measure that can be associated with arbitrary values of the fit parameters .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath72 statistic is an easily calculated measure of goodness - of - fit , but is biased by the presence of intrinsic scatter .",
    "we compromise by using a modified @xmath72 statistic which accounts for intrinsic scatter by introducing an additional dispersion term , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the measurement error on @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the additional dispersion .",
    "this statistic is defined in terms of @xmath58 given @xmath59 because the luminosity measurement errors are negligible in comparison to the mass measurement errors ( figure  [ fig : ml_x1_y ] ) .",

    "the @xmath77 statistic thus does not measure absolute goodness - of - fit , but goodness relative to the best fit .",
    "note that in the cosmological analysis we use the fixed value @xmath80 from our reference cosmology ( see section  [ sec : mllikelihood ] for details ) .",
    "a common log - normal intrinsic scatter in luminosity for a given mass can be estimated from the scatter in the data about the best fit , with measurement errors subtracted in quadrature .",
    "since these data are predominantly at very low redshift , we use this procedure to estimate the @xmath33 value of the intrinsic dispersion ( see equation  [ eq : mlsevol ] ) , @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the parameters describing the best fit . under assumptions of normal measurement errors and intrinsic scatter , the quantity @xmath84 is drawn from a chi - square distribution with @xmath85 degrees of freedom .",

    "the scatter in mass bias between clusters , @xmath66 , is propagated into the mass error bars , @xmath89 , and thus impacts directly the estimated intrinsic scatter , @xmath86 ( equation  [ eq : mls_estimation ] ) .",
    "this results in a degeneracy between @xmath66 and @xmath87 ; however , @xmath66 is not coupled to the other fit parameters , and so we can take its systematic uncertainty into account simply by increasing the width of the likelihood function for @xmath87 .",
    "we therefore replace the chi - square likelihood discussed above by the gamma distribution ( of which the chi - square distribution is a special case ) . fixing the location of the distribution s peak and augmenting its variance by a factor of @xmath90 ,",

    "finally , we account for a 20 per cent systematic uncertainty in the mean bias , @xmath65 , by straightforwardly marginalizing over an appropriate prior . in detail , we parametrize the mean bias through @xmath95 , since this quantity is added to the log - masses , @xmath58 .",

    "significant curvature would indicate a poor match in distribution . ]     of the rb02 data for the best fitting relation to the normal distribution .",

    "inset : the histogram of @xmath59 residuals is directly compared with the normal distribution . ]      in order to verify the appropriateness of the hydrostatic bias correction applied to the rb02 masses , we compare the results of section  [ sec : rbdata ] with the data of @xcite , for which masses were measured using weak gravitational lensing .",
    "these masses , with associated luminosities taken from the bcs and extended bcs ( ebcs ) catalogs , are shown in figure  [ fig : dahle_x1_y ] ( black points ) .",
    "in contrast to the rb02 data , the malmquist bias due to the ( e)bcs flux limit is clearly evident ; in particular , the least massive clusters in this data set are very likely to represent the upper tail of the distribution of luminosities for given mass . although the simple methods described above are unsuitable for fitting the mass  luminosity relation when the data are subject to significant malmquist bias , the intersection of these two data sets near the highest observed masses indicates qualitatively that they are compatible .    ) .",
    "the effect of the ( e)bcs flux limit on the dahle data ( @xmath104 ) is clearly evident . at lower masses ( @xmath58 ) , the data set is progressively more likely to contain only the most luminous clusters for that mass , resulting in an apparent steepening of the relation . ]",
    "we can quantify this observation by using the @xcite data to fit for the normalization , @xmath88 , by minimizing @xmath77 , while leaving the slope , @xmath56 , fixed at the best - fitting value from section  [ sec : rbdata ] .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional 68.3 per cent confidence interval is @xmath105 ( figure  [ fig : dahle_rb_conf ] ) , in agreement with the corrected rb02 data .",
    "in contrast , the lensing constraint is incompatible at the 68 per cent confidence level with the confidence regions that would have been obtained from the x - ray data without applying the bias correction ( dashed lines in figure  [ fig : dahle_rb_conf ] ) .",
    "we use three flux - limited surveys in our analysis : the bcs @xcite and reflex sample @xcite at low redshifts ( @xmath106 ) , and the macs @xcite at @xmath107 .",
    "( we restricted the reflex sample to the southern hemisphere so that its coverage on the sky would not overlap the bcs . ) as discussed in section  [ sec : xlflikelihood ] , a proper accounting of the intrinsic scatter in the mass  luminosity relation involves convolving over all possible masses when evaluating the likelihood of a set of cosmological parameters ; it is therefore necessary for the mass  luminosity relation to be well calibrated at luminosities significantly ( at least an order of magnitude ) below those allowed in the surveys .",
    "we thus also restrict the analysis to clusters with large inferred luminosities @xmath108 .",
    "the completeness of the reflex sample was investigated by @xcite and @xcite , and is thought to be @xmath109 per cent at a flux limit of @xmath110 .",
    "the bcs completeness as a function of flux is quantified in @xcite ; we use a flux limit of @xmath111 where the bcs completeness is 90 per cent .",
    "most of the incompleteness in the bcs is due to the inefficient extended - source detection of the rass ii algorithm , which is most severe at very low redshifts .",
    "one consequence of our high luminosity cut is that the sample contains mostly higher redshift objects ( @xmath112 ) and not the large number of low redshift , low luminosity objects that would be included in a strictly flux - limited sample .",
    "the reported completeness of the bcs is thus a significant underestimate for the sub - sample of very luminous clusters used in our analysis .",
    "we have repeated the analysis of the bcs data alone ( see section  [ sec : lcdmresults ] ) using a higher flux limit ( @xmath113 ) where the reported bcs incompleteness is negligible , and obtain a similar result .",
    "we conclude that significant incompleteness is not present in the bcs , given our selection criteria .",
    "the similar numbers of clusters ( 78 and 80 , respectively ) in the bcs and reflex samples satisfying the bcs flux limit and our luminosity cut also support this conclusion .",
    "unlike the bcs and reflex , for which extended - source fluxes were measured using the voronoi tessellation and percolation @xcite and growth curve analysis @xcite algorithms , respectively , reported macs fluxes are measured within a fixed angular size aperture ( 5 arcmin in most cases ) . a redshift - dependent correction for missing flux , described in @xcite ,",
    "is required when converting this aperture flux to total flux , both when determining luminosities for the detected clusters themselves and when computing the aperture flux - dependent survey sky coverage @xcite .",
    "we adopt an aperture flux limit of @xmath114 , for which the completeness is @xmath109 per cent @xcite .    using the flux and redshift limits and",
    "the luminosity cut discussed above , the bcs , reflex and macs samples respectively contribute 78 , 130 and 34 clusters to our sample .",

    "is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "error bars are not shown .",
    "note that even though no clusters above our adopted flux limit were found at redshifts @xmath115 , the lack of any such detections is significant in the analysis . ]    in order to adequately take the effects of eddington bias into account when predicting the number of clusters above our flux and luminosity thresholds for a given cosmology and mass  luminosity relation , we must be able to assign a probability to the luminosity observed from a cluster , given its true luminosity .",
    "ultimately , the distribution is related to a poisson distribution in the number of photons detected ; however , the nontrivial conversion from photon count rate to unabsorbed flux and the variation in exposure times over the sky make the solution from first principles computationally difficult .",
    "instead , we simplify the problem by assuming that the distribution @xmath116 , where @xmath22 and @xmath21 are the observed and true luminosities , is normal with mean @xmath21 . the variance is a function of the observed flux , which we estimate empirically for each sample by fitting the flux errors versus flux to a power - law model .",
    "we find power - law slopes of 0.52 for the bcs and reflex samples and 0.56 for macs , consistent with approximately poisson scaling .",

    "both are in good agreement with the true samples , which respectively contain 78 , 130 and 34 clusters above flux and luminosity thresholds of section  [ sec : xlf ] .",
    "this agreement for the @xmath16cdm case is displayed graphically as a function of the flux limit in figure  [ fig : goodness ] .",
    "( the numbers quoted above correspond to the low - flux ends of the lines in the figure . )",
    "the equivalent figure for @xmath2cdm looks similar .",
    "above detect flux @xmath147 as a function of @xmath147 ( @xmath148 distribution ) for bcs ( dotted line , above / right ) , reflex ( solid line , above / right ) and macs ( solid line , below / left ) . shaded areas indicate the predictions and 68 per cent confidence regions of the best - fitting @xmath16cdm model .",
    "due to the similar sky areas covered , the bcs and reflex predictions are essentially identical at @xmath149 . ]     and @xmath1 for a constant-@xmath2 model using standard priors ( solid , black lines ) and weak priors on @xmath134 and @xmath122 ( dashed , blue lines ) . weakening these priors results in a slight expansion of the confidence region along the @xmath0-@xmath1 degeneracy axis .",
    "the priors have no affect on the determination of @xmath2 . ]",
    "the standard priors used in our analysis are conservative ; however , we have also performed analyses using the even more conservative priors labeled as `` weak '' in table  [ tab : priors ] .",
    "these weak - prior results effectively demonstrate the degeneracies between parameters of interest ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and each nuisance parameter , given the current level of statistical and systematic uncertainty .",
    "two of these weak priors , on @xmath136 and @xmath150 , did not result in significant changes to any of the cosmological constraints .",
    "the results of the other tests are summarized below .",
    "one - dimensional , marginalized results for each of these analyses are also presented in table  [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "we consider @xmath134 and @xmath122 together , since both influence the results only through the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "the results obtained by doubling the width of the gaussian priors on these parameters ( blue , dashed contours ) is compared with our standard - prior constraint in figure  [ fig : priors_hwb_s8 ] .",
    "the effect of weakening these priors is primarily to expand the constraints along the @xmath0-@xmath1 degeneracy curve .",
    "the constraint on @xmath2 is not affected .",
    "we next consider the effect of marginalizing over @xmath119 using a gaussian prior of width 0.05 , significantly larger than the constraint obtained from wmap @xcite .",
    "like @xmath134 and @xmath122 , the effect of freeing this parameter is to weaken the constraints along the @xmath0-@xmath1 degeneracy , although the effect is relatively small , even with this wide prior ( left panel of figure  [ fig : fwcdm_compare ] ) .",
    "the weak prior on @xmath124 doubles the uncertainty on the j01 normalization to 40 per cent .",
    "the result is a decrease in constraining power on @xmath0 and @xmath2 , but not significantly on @xmath1 .",
    "the expansion of the dark - energy constraints can be seen in figure  [ fig : priors_a_w ] .     and @xmath2 for a constant-@xmath2 model using standard priors ( solid , black lines ) and a weak prior on the normalization of the mass function , @xmath124 ( dashed , blue lines ) .",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath2 are weakened , although @xmath1 is not greatly affected ( table  [ tab : constraints ] ) . ]      since @xmath125 describes only the redshift evolution of the mass  luminosity relation , doubling the size of its uniform prior has no effect on the determination of the redshift - zero quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as can be seen in table  [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "however , there is a degeneracy with @xmath2 , resulting in a poorer constraint ( table  [ tab : constraints ] , prior 5 ) .",
    "the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and other point - like x - ray emitters is a potential concern for the accuracy of the mass  luminosity relation .",
    "there is no possibility of subtracting these point sources from the rass data , since the number of photons in a cluster detection is typically too small .",
    "however , they are subtracted from the rb02 luminosities , to the extent that _ rosat _ can resolve them .",
    "in addition , there is the possibility of an increase in the density of agn over the redshift range of our data ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there may therefore be an inequivalence between luminosities inferred from the rass data and those used in the calibration of the mass  luminosity relation . in our work studying macs clusters ( in preparation ) , we take advantage of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory s high spatial resolution to efficiently identify point sources and determine their contribution to the total cluster luminosity .",
    "we find that this contribution is at the few per cent level  much smaller than the typical survey flux uncertainty  and conclude that point source contamination is not an issue for the current study .",
    "the bias in the measured masses of the mass  luminosity data is completely degenerate with the mass function normalization , @xmath124 , which in turn affects inferences made on the other parameters .",
    "consequently , it is important to include in the analysis the mean correction to masses motivated by departures from hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath65 , and the scatter in this bias among clusters , @xmath66 , as well as the uncertainty in both quantities .",
    "figure  [ fig : massbias ] shows that the constraints obtained by fixing the mean bias and bias scatter at their nominal values ( blue , dashed contours ) are spuriously tighter than those of our standard analysis ( black , solid contours ) by @xmath151 per cent on @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath152 per cent on @xmath2 . also shown is the result of neglecting the bias correction entirely ( red , solid contours ) , which results in lower values of @xmath1 compared with the nominal correction .",
    "comparing the results for priors 7 and 8 in table  [ tab : constraints ] with our standard - prior results , it is clear that the uncertainty in @xmath66 has a greater effect than the uncertainty in @xmath65 .",
    "this is encouraging , since the former is due primarily to the very small number of simulations used to calibrate the observational mass bias . straightforwardly increasing",
    "the number of simulated clusters should result in significant improvement to our constraints .",
    "the mass distribution of clusters available to a flux - limited survey is influenced by the degree of scatter in flux for a given mass . as described in section  [ sec : xlflikelihood ] , this effect can be decomposed into convolutions due to intrinsic scatter in the mass  luminosity relation and measurement error in the survey flux determinations .",
    "failure to account for either of these sources of scatter when evaluating the number of detectable clusters predicted by a set of model parameters can significantly bias the result .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : mlfscat ] , which shows the results for a @xmath2cdm cosmology obtained by ignoring either of these scatters individually . in each case , the results are biased towards lower @xmath0 and higher @xmath1 , along the degeneracy between the two parameters .",
    "the constraints on cosmological parameters , including @xmath2 , are also spuriously tight in both cases .",
    "( the joint @xmath0-@xmath2 constraints are not shown , but closely resemble the tighter results in figure  [ fig : massbias ] . )",
    "this results from the fact that any scatter in luminosity compounds the systematic effect of uncertainty in @xmath65 . in the case where intrinsic mass  luminosity dispersion is ignored ,",
    "the contributions due to uncertainty in @xmath87 , @xmath136 and @xmath66 also vanish from the error budget .      in the analysis",
    "thus far , we have accounted for dark - energy density perturbations assuming that the sound speed is equal to the speed of light ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : constraints ] ( prior 12 ) shows that marginalizing over such a constant sound speed ( @xmath154 ) has no effect on our results ( but note that dark - energy models generally predict a time - varying sound speed ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite showed that including such perturbations greatly reduces the ability of wmap data to discriminate among models with @xmath155 ( figure  [ fig : fwcdm_compare ] , _ cf .",
    "_ figures 15 and 16 of spergel et al . ) .",
    "in contrast , the effect of dark - energy perturbations on the xlf constraints is less dramatic ; table  [ tab : constraints ] ( prior 13 ) shows that an analysis with no perturbations results in somewhat larger constraints on @xmath2 , opposite in character from the wmap analysis .",
    "we have presented new constraints on cosmological - constant ( @xmath16cdm ) and constant-@xmath2 ( @xmath2cdm ) dark - energy models using the observed x - ray luminosity function of the largest , most x - ray luminous galaxy clusters out to redshift 0.7 , in combination with standard priors on @xmath134 and @xmath122 . at 68.3 per cent confidence , we find @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a @xmath16cdm model , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for a @xmath2cdm model .",
    "these results include marginalization over uncertainties in the theoretical mass function , non - self - similar evolution in the mass  luminosity relation , and the bias in mass estimates from x - ray observations .",
    "our results constitute the first precise determination of the dark - energy equation of state using measurements of the growth of cosmic structure observed in galaxy clusters , and provide additional support for the cosmological - constant model .",
    "these results build upon , and are largely in agreement with , a number of earlier galaxy cluster studies ( see section  [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "our constraints on cosmological parameters are consistent with independent findings from studies of type ia supernovae , anisotropies in the cmb , the x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters , galaxy redshift surveys and leading cosmic shear surveys .",
    "the agreement between the results from these independent techniques is reassuring , and motivates a combined analysis of the data in order to investigate more complex models of dark energy . combining our data with cmb , snia and @xmath17 data ,",
    "we find @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    the results for @xmath1 presented here are somewhat higher than those from previous work based on the bcs and reflex data due to our correction to the masses used to constrain the mass  luminosity relation .",
    "the magnitude of this discrepancy underscores the need for an improved understanding of the observational biases resulting from asphericity , projection effects and hydrostatic disequilibrium .",
    "more advanced and comprehensive simulations , calibrated by gravitational lensing studies , show considerable promise in this area .",
    "broad - band , high spectral resolution x - ray data from , for example , the new x - ray telescope ( next ) and constellation - x , will allow precise measurements of gas velocities and non - thermal emission components in clusters , providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relevant gas physics . in the short term , simply increasing the number of simulated clusters used to calibrate the observational bias would reduce the uncertainty in the scatter in bias among clusters . since the uncertainty in this scatter is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in @xmath1 , this approach provides a relatively easy means of improving the precision of our results .    with regard to dark energy , the systematics due to the theoretical mass function and the redshift evolution of the mass  observable relation are also important .",
    "the former can be addressed with a large suite of cosmological simulations , allowing a more precise parametrization of the cosmological dependence of the mass function .",
    "the latter necessitates a more rigorous study of galaxy cluster virial relations and their evolution , carefully accounting for selection effects .",
    "such improved analysis techniques will be required if future , high - redshift x - ray ( e.g. spectrum - rg / erosita ) or sunyaev - zeldovich surveys are to be used to their full potential .",
