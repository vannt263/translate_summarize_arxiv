    "the electronic effects in mesoscopic rings were studied by using the non - relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite based on the schr \" odinger equation with additional terms describing the spin - orbit interaction @xcite-@xcite .    however , there are nano - systems , as for example the graphenes , where several relativistic effects can be observed in the electronic transport . these can be satisfactory explained considering the electrons as massless dirac particles moving on honeycomb lattices @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other dirac materials are the topological insulators like @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum wells with low density and high mobility , in which the quantum spin hall effect can be realized @xcite .    consequently , many studies @xcite , @xcite-@xcite concentrate on the relativistic effects considering the electrons near the fermi surface as being described by the @xmath3-dimensional dirac equation corresponding to a restricted three - dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "however , in this manner one restricts simultaneously not only the orbital degrees of freedom but the spin ones too , reducing them to those of the @xmath4 symmetry .    under such circumstances",
    ", we believe that there are situations when it is convenient to use the _ complete _ @xmath5-dimensional dirac equation restricting the orbital motion , according to the concrete geometry of the studied system , but without affecting the natural spin degrees of freedom described by the @xmath6 group .",
    "thus the polarization effects could be better pointed out .",
    "nevertheless , the complete dirac equation was only occasionally used for investigating some special problems of the fermions in external aharonov - bohm ( ab ) field as for example the spin effects in perturbation theory @xcite , the behaviour of the ab fermions in mit cylinders @xcite and even the ab dynamics using numerical methods .    in the present report",
    "we discuss this topics focusing on the results obtained in refs .",
    "herein we have shown first that the solutions of the dirac equation in ab rings and cylinders may be determined as common eigenspinors of a complete systems of commuting operators including the energy , total angular momentum and a specific operator analogous to the well - known dirac spherical operator of the relativistic central problems @xcite .",
    "these solutions can be normalized with respect to the relativistic scalar product obtaining thus the system of normalized fundamental solutions that allow us to write down the exact expressions of the relativistic partial currents and derive the persistent ones .",
    "the relativistic partial currents we have obtained are related to the derivative of the relativistic energies as in the non - relativistic case but , in contrast with this , there appears a crucial difference , i. e. in the non - relativistic theory the partial currents are proportional to the angular momentum while in our approach the relativistic currents tend to _ saturation _ in the limit of high total angular momenta . for this reason we have reconsidered the problem of the relativistic persistent currents at @xmath0 proposing an approximative analytic formula that matches the numerical calculations with a satisfactory accuracy @xcite .",
    "this report is organized as follows . in the second section we present the relativistic theory of the fermions in ab rings based on a suitable restriction of the complete dirac equation , deducing the form of the normalized spinors , deriving the partial currents and writing down the formula of the persistent currents .",
    "the next section is devoted to the relativistic theory of the fermions in ab cylinders based on a restriction of the complete dirac equation appropriate to this case .",
    "the fundamental solutions on finite or infinite ab cylinders are derived and the partial current are calculated pointing out the saturation effect in both these cases .",
    "for the finite cylinders we apply boundary conditions of mit type that eliminate the longitudinal current but preserving the saturation properties of the circular one . finally , we derive the persistent circular currents at @xmath0 on finite ab cylinders discussing the case of very short ones and the non - relativistic limit .",
    "let us consider a dirac fermion of mass @xmath7 moving on a _ ideal _ ring of radius @xmath8 whose axis is oriented along the homogeneous and static external magnetic field @xmath9 given by the electromagnetic potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the ideal ring is a one - dimensional manifold ( without internal structure ) embedded in the three - dimensional space according to the equations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath14 with the @xmath15 axis oriented along @xmath9 .",
    "then , it is natural to assume that any field @xmath16 defined on this manifold depends only on the remaining coordinates @xmath17 such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the notation @xmath25 stands for the usual dimensionless flux parameter ( in natural units ) .    from this action",
    "we obtain the correctly restricted dirac equation , @xmath26 , with the new self - adjoint dirac operator @xmath27 whose supplemental last term guarantees that @xmath28 .",
    "this operator commutes with the energy operator @xmath29 and the third component , @xmath30 , of the total angular momentum , formed by the orbital part @xmath31 the spin one @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we have the opportunity to look for particular solutions of the form @xmath33 which satisfy the common eigenvalue problems , @xmath34 and @xmath35 laying out the energy @xmath36 and the angular quantum number @xmath37 whose values are determined by the condition @xmath38 .    in this manner we separated the variables remaining with a system of algebraic equations that in the standard representation of the gamma matrices ( with diagonal @xmath39 ) reads @xmath40",

    "therefore , we may ask how these solutions can be defined as different eigenspinors of a new operator . the answer is obvious if we observe that the desired operator is @xmath55 which satisfies @xmath56 .",
    "the conclusion is that the spinors @xmath57 are common eigenspinors of the complete set of commuting operators @xmath58 .",

    "note that the genuine three - dimensional operator @xmath61 can not be used here because of our dimensional reduction such that we must consider the simplified version @xmath59 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this operator give the polarization in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "for this reason we keep this terminology considering that the eigenvalues @xmath62 of the operator @xmath59 define the fermion polarization with respect to the direction of the magnetic field @xmath9 .      using the above results we can calculate the exact relativistic expressions of the partial currents on quantum rings , pointing out the difference between the genuine relativistic theory and the non - relativistic one .",
    "we show that in the relativistic approach the partial current tends to saturation for increasing @xmath63 such that the persistent currents at @xmath0 will get new properties .",
    "let us start with the quantum rings where the states of the fermions of energy @xmath64 are described by the normalized linear combinations @xmath65 for which the expectation value of the polarization operator reads , @xmath66    the partial currents ( of given @xmath63 ) coincide in this case with their densities , @xmath67 , that can be calculated with the help of the matrix ( [ gamph ] ) . then , observing that @xmath68 we obtain the _ partial _ current of a fermion of energy @xmath42 as @xmath69 since @xmath70 .",
    "thus we find that the partial currents are independent on polarization being related to energies in a similar manner as in the non - relativistic theory .",
    "the exact relativistic expressions of the partial currents we obtained here depend only on two dimensionless parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 in usual units ) that are the arguments of the auxiliary function @xmath74 defined as @xmath75 this function has the remarkable asymptotic behaviour @xmath76 which shows that the relativistic partial currents tend to _ saturation _ for large values of @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , for small values of @xmath77 we can expand @xmath78 note that the non - relativistic limit recovers the well - known behaviours @xmath79    hereby we conclude that the principal difference is that the relativistic partial currents ( [ irel ] ) are saturated while in the non - relativistic case we do not meet this effect since the function @xmath80 is replaced then by the linear function @xmath81 that is just its tangent in @xmath82 as we deduce from eq .",
    "( [ cucu ] ) .",
    "this result was previously outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite but based on the non - hermitian dirac equation of ref .",
    "obviously , the correct saturation effect is given by the expression of the partial currents ( [ irel ] ) derived here .",
    "note that the non - relativistic approximation can be used with a satisfactory accuracy only in the domain where the function @xmath80 is approaching to the linear function @xmath81 .",
    "our numerical evaluations show that in the domain @xmath83 the difference @xmath84 is satisfactory small remaining less than 0.05 .",
    "in addition , we estimate that for @xmath85 the current is approaching to its saturation value since @xmath86 .",
    "the above results allow us to derive the total persistent current at @xmath0 in a semiconductor ring of parameter @xmath87 having a even number of electrons @xmath88 fixed by the fermi - dirac statistics . for the mesoscopic rings with @xmath89",

    "this seems to be the minimal value of @xmath87 obtained so far but it is possible to obtain smaller values in further experiments with mesoscopic rings with @xmath94 or even with nano - rings having @xmath95 . according to our estimation , the relativistic effects may be measurable for @xmath96 which means that the actual experiments are approaching to this threshold which could be reached soon .    in all these cases",

    "<S> the exact solutions of the complete ( 1 + 3)-dimensional dirac equation of fermions moving in ideal aharonov - bohm ( ab ) rings and cylinders are used for deriving the exact expressions of the relativistic partial currents . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that these currents can be related to the derivative of the fermion energy with respect to the flux parameter , just as in the non - relativistic case . however , a new and remarkable relativistic effect is the saturation of the partial currents for high values of the total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> based on this property , the total relativistic persistent currents at @xmath0 is evaluated for rings and cylinders obtaining approximative simple closed formulas .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : dirac equation ; aharonov - bohm ring ; aharonov - bohm cylinder ; persistent current ; saturation . </S>"
