    "type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are produced by the final explosion of massive ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 ) stars .",
    "they retain a significant part of their hydrogen envelope at the time of the explosion , and hence their spectra show strong balmer lines .",
    "studies of the variety of sne  ii have relied on photometric analysis , cataloging this group in two sub - classes according to the shape of the light curve : sne with a plateau ( quasi - constant luminosity for a period of a few months ) are classified as sne iip , while sne with steeper declining linear light curves as sne iil @xcite .",
    "however , despite the role played by sne  ii in stellar evolution , the impact on their environments and their importance as standardized candles , an overall picture describing the physics which underpins their diversity is lacking . it has been suggested that sne  iil are produced by progenitors which explode with smaller mass h envelopes , which then lead to sne with more linearly declining light curves and shorter or non - existent ` plateaus ' @xcite .",
    "indeed , this was argued to be the case for the prototype sn  iil 1979c @xcite . this would imply that sne iil progenitors suffer from a higher level of mass - loss than their iip counterparts .",
    "in addition , a number of sne  iil have shown evidence for circumstellar ( csm ) interaction at late times ( e.g. sn 1986e , @xcite ; sn  1979c , @xcite ) , which has been interpreted as evidence of interaction of the ejecta with the pre - supernova csm ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . however , a number of authors have also claimed evidence for signs of csm interaction in sne  iip ( e.g. sn  1999em , @xcite ; sn  2004et , @xcite ; sn  2007od , @xcite , @xcite ; sn  2009bw , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in recent years many individual studies have been published focusing on particular properties of individual sne , but few statistical studies where the spectral and photometric properties have been directly related are available . @xcite",
    "found correlations and anti - correlations between the maximum b - band magnitude ( @xmath5 ) , the color at maximum ( @xmath6 ) and the ratio of absorption to emission ( @xmath7 ) in h@xmath0 , concluding that sne iil have shallower p - cygni profiles ( larger @xmath7 values ) than sne iip .",
    "@xcite analysed 17 sne iip and found that sne with brighter plateaus have higher expansion velocities .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite with four sne ii , who concluded that low luminosity sne have narrow spectral lines indicating low expansion velocities .",
    "@xcite used observations together with the analytical models of @xcite to derive physical sn  iip properties .",
    "he found that more massive progenitors produce more energetic explosions and in turn produce more nickel .",
    "these results were confirmed by @xcite with a heterogeneous group of sne  ii that share a very wide range of physical properties . + despite the above results , it is currently unclear whether underlying spectral and photometric relations exist for the whole ensemble of sn  ii events .",
    "therefore , here we attempt to remedy this situation by presenting an initial statistical analysis of various spectroscopic and photometric properties of a large sample of sne  ii .",
    "+ in this letter we present results showing the diversity of h@xmath0 p - cygni profiles , and relations between spectral and photometric parameters for a sample of 52 sne .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we outline our sn sample and we define the measurements , then in   3 we present the results . in   4 possible physical explanations of those results are discussed , and finally in   5 we list our conclusions .",
    "we note that a detailed analysis of the @xmath2-band light curve properties of the currently analyzed sample of sn  ii is being presented in anderson et al .",
    "( submitted , hereafter a14 ) .",
    "the sample of sne ii employed in this study was obtained by the carnegie supernova project ( csp , @xcite ) between 2004 and 2009 plus previous campaings : the calan / tololo supernova survey ( ct ) , the cerro tololo sn program , the supernova optical and infrared survey ( soirs ) and the carnegie type ii supernova survey ( cats ) .",
    "the full spectroscopic sample will be published in an upcoming paper .",
    "data reductions were performed with iraf using the standard routines ( bias subtracted , flat - field correction , 1-d extraction and wavelength correction ) .",
    "detailed discussion of spectroscopic observations and reductions for csp was first presented in @xcite , then outlined further in @xcite .",
    "these are also applicable to previous data . from this database we selected a sub - sample of events with sufficient data to measure our spectral and photometric parameters .",
    "sn  iin and sn  iib were not analysed in this work .",
    "+ sne ii show a large diversity in their spectra . as the dominant spectral feature is the h@xmath0 p - cygni profile , for this initial study we concentrate on this line s properties .",
    "the h@xmath0 line presents a diversity that can be derived from the shape and strength in the emission and absorption , and in the line width .",
    "figure  1 shows the variety in sne  ii h@xmath0 p - cygni profiles , where the sne are ordered in terms of an increasing ratio of absorption to emission ( @xmath1 ) components ( as defined below ) around a common epoch at the start in the recombination phase .",
    "we see that the absorption is the component which changes most from one sn to another rather than the emission .",
    "there are sne with little absorption ( e.g. sn  2006ai , sn  2006y ) , while there are others with boxy absorption profiles ( e.g. sn  2003cx , sn 2007x ) .",
    "one can observe in figure  1 that the first sne show little absorption compared to emission .",
    "gradually the sne change to show more classic p - cygni profiles with significant absorption components . a number of sne show an extra absorption component on the blue side of h@xmath0 ( e.g. sn  2003hn , sn  2007od , sn  2008aw ) .    to analyze the sne spectra within our sample we define two measurements : * ( 1 ) * the expansion velocity in h@xmath0 via the fwhm of the emission , and * ( 2 ) * the ratio of equivalent widths of absorption to emission @xmath8 components of h@xmath0 .",
    "this ratio was initially proposed by @xcite as the flux ratio of the emission to absorption .",
    "however , we choose @xmath1 because in a few sne h@xmath0 shows an extremely weak absorption component . in order to relate spectral and light curve properties we use the _ v_-band photometric properties as defined by a14 : _ @xmath9 _ : initial decline from the maximum ( magnitudes @xmath10 ) , _",
    "@xmath11 _ : ` plateau ' decline rate ( magnitudes @xmath10 ) , _ @xmath12 _ : radioactive tail decline ( magnitudes @xmath10 ) , _ m@xmath13 _ : magnitude at _",
    "v_-band maximum , and _ optd _ : optically thick phase duration ( days ) : time from the explosion epoch through to the end of the plateau phase .",
    "we define a common epoch in order to measure spectral properties , which we identified in the light curves : the _ b_-band transition time plus 10 days ( @xmath14 , at the start of the recombination phase ) . the transition time is defined as the transition between _ @xmath9 _ and _ @xmath11 _ determined by chi - square minimization .",
    "it is measured in the _ b_-band because the transition is more evident than in _",
    "v_-band , and therefore we can include more sne in our analysis .",
    "we interpolate all the spectral measurements to this epoch .",
    "these parameters are all labeled in the light - curve parameter schematic presented in figure  2 ( left ) .        to estimate sn ejecta expansion velocities through h@xmath0 the minimum flux of the absorption component of p - cygni line profile",
    "is commonly used . however",
    ", a few sne in this sample present an extremely weak absorption component , complicating this method .",
    "therefore , we employ the fwhm of emission line for velocity estimations . to verify the concordance between these methods we measure velocities from the minima of absorption and the fwhm of the emission in h@xmath0 in sne with a well defined absorption , finding consistent results .",
    "the ratio of absorption to emission ( @xmath1 ) in h@xmath0 was obtained by measuring the equivalent widths ( ew ) of each component .",
    "examples of these measurements are shown in figure  2 ( right ) .",
    "the top panel shows a normal h@xmath0 p - cygni profile , i.e. , a profile with well defined absorption and emission components , while the bottom panel shows a peculiar profile with an extra absorption component on the blue side .",
    "similar features were identified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in sn  1999em as high velocity ( hv ) features , while in the case of sn  2005cs the line was identified as si ii @xmath15 absorption @xcite .",
    "this peculiar structure complicates measurements of the ew of absorption , because it is hard to objectively define the continuum .",
    "therefore , we simply trace a straight line along the absorption feature to mimic the continuum flux , which can be seen in figure  2 ( right ) .",
    "all spectral measurements were performed with iraf using the _ splot _ package .",
    "the errors for the h@xmath0 velocity and @xmath1 are mainly dominated by how the continuum is defined .",
    "errors were obtained by measuring many times the fwhm and the ew , respectively , changing the trace of the continuum . using these multiple measurements we calculate a mean and take the standard deviation to be the error on that measurement .",
    "in table  1 we list the measured spectral and photometric parameters : h@xmath0 velocity , @xmath1 , _ @xmath9 _ , _ @xmath11 _ , _ @xmath12 _ , m@xmath13 and _ optd _ for each sn , together with the host galaxy , the heliocentric radial velocity and @xmath16 .",
    "we searched for correlations between all seven of our defined parameters against each other at different epochs : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( measured in _",
    "b_-band ) , and 30 and 50d since explosion . using the pearson correlation test , @xmath1 was observed to be the dominant measured spectral parameter as it has the highest correlation with all other parameters at all epochs . however , at @xmath14 the correlations are strongest , hence this time was chosen as the common epoch .",
    "this is justified from a physical point of view because at this epoch all sne are entering to a similar phase in their evolution , i.e. the recombination phase .",
    "the photometric parameter _",
    "@xmath9 _ has the highest mean correlation , however it shows no correlation with the h@xmath0 velocity , while _",
    "@xmath11 _ shows high correlation with all parameters . in a14",
    "the photometric correlations are presented .",
    "table  2 shows the strength of the correlations between all our parameters , plus the number of events ( within each correlation ) , and the probability of finding such a correction by chance .",
    "the light curve parameters plus the h@xmath0 velocity are plotted versus @xmath1 in figure  3 .",
    "the plot shows that sne with smaller @xmath1 have higher h@xmath0 velocities , more rapidly declining light curves after maximum , both in the ` plateau ' and radioactive tail phases , are brighter and have shorter _ optd _ values .",
    "sne with higher @xmath1 show opposite behavior .",
    "given that _",
    "optd _ and _ @xmath12 _ are most likely related to the envelope / ejecta mass ( see a14 for detailed discussion ) , this would appear to imply that @xmath1 is also related to the mass retained by the progenitor before explosion .",
    "indeed , this further points to sne historically classified as iil ( high _ @xmath11 _ ) having smaller mass envelopes at the epoch of explosion than their iip ( low _ @xmath11 _ ) counterparts .",
    "moreover , we see a continuum of events in terms of spectral diversity , thus suggesting a possible continuum in pre - sn envelope masses .",
    "+ in figure  3 one can see an extreme object specifically in panels a , b and e , sn  2006y . to test",
    "whether this object drives our correlations we re - do the pearson test for all correlations removing this object .",
    "while of the strength of the correlations decrease very slightly all correlations hold , and therefore this object is not driving our results .",
    "+ we also searched for correlations between @xmath1 and the photospheric velocity , derived from the minimum of absorption of the fe ii @xmath205169 @xmath21 line at the epoch defined above .",
    "however , perhaps surprisingly , no evidence for correlation was found .",
    "we have presented and analysed the h@xmath0 spectral diversity in 52 sne ii and their correlations with photometric parameters . analyzing the sample we see a variety in the h@xmath0 p - cygni profiles which can be derived from the shape and strength in the emission and absorption , and in the line width .",
    "@xcite found that m@xmath22 and @xmath6 correlate with @xmath7 in h@xmath0 , concluding that sne  iil have larger @xmath7 values ( i.e. small @xmath1 values ) .",
    "while in our sample we have not made distinctive iip - iil classification , our results are consistent with these of @xcite , which show that sne with high _ @xmath11 _ values ( faster declining light curves ) have small @xmath1 values and are more luminous .",
    "+ @xcite identified a subdivision of sne  ii ( based on 21 events in the _ r_-band ) suggesting that sne  iil and sne  iip are not members of one continuous class and may result from different physical progenitor systems .",
    "however , a14 with a bigger sample ( 116 events in the _ v_-band ) suggest an observational continuum of events which may be driven by differences of envelope mass at the epoch of explosion , a parameter which is most directly constrained in a14 through observations of the optically thick phase duration ( _ optd _ ) and the decline rate during the radioactive tail ( _ @xmath12 _ )",
    ". this conclusion of an observational continuum is also supported by the spectral analysis presented in this paper ( see figure  3 ) , where differences in the spectral parameters ( especially @xmath1 ) may also be explained by changes in the hydrogen envelope mass retained .",
    "+ @xcite discussed possible explanations for the behavior of the h@xmath0 p - cygni profile with the most likely being : * ( 1 ) * extra emission fills in the absorption component ( as can be seen in sn  2008aw , figure  2 , bottom ) ; * ( 2 ) * the envelope mass is low ; and * ( 3 ) * a steep density gradient in the hydrogen envelope .",
    "the first explanation invokes scattering of emission off either csm or the outer envelope ( in the case of very extended envelope ) .",
    "the second explanation is described in a low - mass envelope , where there is less absorbing material , so little p - cygni absorption component will be formed .",
    "the third explanation argues that a very steep density gradient implies less absorbing material at high velocities , and so does not produce a well defined p - cygni profile .",
    "although these considerations could explain the diversity found in our sample , numerous studies discuss other explanations based on the complex p - cygni line profiles .",
    "@xcite granted the term ` complicated p - cygni profile ' to explain the double p - cygni absorption found in balmer series and he i @xmath23 in sn  1999em , concluding that these absorption features arise in two velocity regions in the expanding ejecta of the sn at different velocities .",
    "@xcite argue that this extra component might be the signature of weak interaction with a low density csm , while @xcite attributes these features to ejecta wind interactions . in conclusion ,",
    "the change in h@xmath0 p - cygni profile ( @xmath1 and fwhm of emission ) is most likely related to two parameters : changes in the envelope properties ( i.e. its mass and density profile ) and the degree of csm interaction .",
    "although the possible explanations for the behavior of the h@xmath0 p - cygni profile have been exposed , these extra components could be attributed to hv h i features or , absorption lines of other ions ( si ii ) .",
    "this issue will be further explored after a full spectral analysis .",
    "this will determine if similar features are also present in the blue side of he i @xmath23 and h@xmath24 .",
    "we have presented an initial analysis of the spectral diversity h@xmath0 of sne  ii and how this relates to light curve properties .",
    "it has been found that while much diversity and peculiarities exist , spectral and photometric properties do appear to be correlated which can be linked to pre - sn properties .",
    "we finally list our main conclusions :    * @xmath1 is an important parameter describing the spectral diversity of sne  ii . *",
    "sne with low @xmath1 values appear to have high @xmath25 velocities and decline rates , are brighter and have a smaller _ optd _ values . * while any definitive spectral distinction between iip and iil is not clear , sne with higher _",
    "@xmath11 _ values ( i.e. more ` linear ' sne ) have smaller @xmath1 values , have higher h@xmath0 velocities , and are more luminous .",
    "* we speculate that the envelope mass retained before explosion and the density gradient play a very important role to determine the differences of h@xmath0 p - cygni profile .",
    "* csm interaction could also be a cause of the change in the p - cygni profiles , suggesting that faster declining sne have more intense interactions .",
    "this paper presented a first analysis of sn  ii spectral from csp .",
    "the full analysis of that sample ( optical and near ir photometry and spectroscopy ) promises to significantly further our knowledge of the sn  ii phenomenon .",
