    "nucleon form factors are essential quantities in understanding the internal structure of the nucleon . for example , the electromagnetic form factors reveal how the charge and the magnetization of quarks are distributed inside a nucleon .",
    "the scalar and axial - vector form factors also provide information on certain aspects of the nucleon structure such as chiral and flavor symmetries and breakdown of them . because of these reasons ,",
    "a great deal of investigations has been performed extensively over decades . on the other hand , the energy - momentum tensor form factors ( emtffs ) of the nucleon , even though they were proposed in 1966  @xcite , has attracted attention only very recently , since there is no probe to measure them directly .",
    "however , the emtffs are as equally important as the electromagnetic ffs , since they also provide crucial information on how the internal structure of the nucleon . the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )",
    "enable one to extract them from hard exclusive reactions  @xcite .",
    "the melin transforms of certain gpds can be identified as the emtffs that expose how the mass and the spin are distributed inside a nucleon .",
    "moreover , the emtffs can be regarded as the touchstone of checking the validity of any model for the nucleon : they provide strong constraints on the model in such a way that the pressure should be zero . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath2-term , one of the emtffs , was deeply related to the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus , the emtffs give us a whole new perspective on the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the emtffs are defined as a nucleon matrix element of the totally symmetric energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) operator as follows  @xcite : @xmath3 u(p,\\,s)\\ , ,    \\label{eq : emtff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the nucleon mass and spinor , respectively . the form factor @xmath9 gives information about the ratio of the momenta carried by constituents of a nucleon . in particular",
    ", @xmath9 at the zero - momentum transfer shows that about 1/2 of the momentum of a fast moving nucleon is carried by quarks , and the other half by gluons .",
    "the other form factor @xmath10 reveals information on the total angular momentum of the quark and gluons , though it is not much known experimentally .",
    "it is less trivial to understand the physical meaning of the last form factor @xmath11 in eq.([eq : emtff ] ) but is equally important , since it explains how the strong forces are distributed and stabilized in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "it can be extracted from the beam charge asymmetry in deeply virtual compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "the emt form factors of the nucleon have been investigated in various approaches , for example , in lattice qcd  @xcite , in chiral perturbation theory @xcite , in the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath12qsm ) @xcite as well as in the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "those of nuclei have also been studied @xcite .",
    "the study of the nucleon emtffs was also extended to nuclear matter  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we want to examine the emtffs of the nucleon , based on a chiral soliton model with vector mesons in the minimal form  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the fact that the nonlinear sigma model has a hidden local gauge symmetry @xmath13  @xcite , in which the @xmath0 meson is identified as a gauge boson . extending this symmetry to @xmath14",
    ", the @xmath1 meson can be also regarded as a gauge boson  @xcite . in this way",
    ", parameters of the model are completely determined in the mesonic sector , so that we can investigate properties of the nucleon in the solitonic sector unambiguously .",
    "this model has a certain virtue in studying the emtffs , since one can study the role of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in describing the nucleon .",
    "it is known that the vector mesons provide short - range repulsion in the one - boson exchange model for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , while the pion dominates the long - range interaction  @xcite .",
    "we will soon show explicitly that the pion gives attraction to form a soliton whereas the vector mesons become repulsive to stabilize it , which is analogous to the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "this is in line with what was found in the skyrme model  @xcite , where it was shown for the skyrme term to stabilize obviously the soliton .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the chiral soliton model with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . in section iii",
    ", we explain how to compute the emtffs of the nucleon within this model . in section iv , we discuss the results of the emtffs .",

    "the result of the pressure density exhibited each role of the @xmath15 and the vector mesons : while the pion provides the strong attraction , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yield the repulsive force that balances in such a way that the stability condition is satisfied .",

    "the energy - momentum tensor form factors provide important information on how the nucleon undergoes changes in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "it is in particular of great interest to study them within the present framework , since the medium - modified @xmath15-@xmath0-@xmath1 soliton model connects the change of the vector meson in nuclear matter with the medium modification of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy - momentum tensor form factors in nuclear matter within the medium - modified @xmath15-@xmath0-@xmath1 soliton model will shed light on the physics of the nucleon in medium .",

    "<S> it is explicitly shown that the pion provides strong attraction whereas the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yield repulsion in such a way that the soliton becomes stabilized . </S>",
