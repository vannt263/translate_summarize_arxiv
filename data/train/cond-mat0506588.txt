    "<S> this formalism is applied to obtain the spatial distribution of microscopic spin currents in _ clean _ phase - coherent two - dimensional electron gas with the rashba - type of so coupling attached to four external leads . </S>",
    "<S> together with the corresponding profiles of the stationary spin density , such visualization of the phase - coherent spin flow allow us to resolve several key issues for the understanding of mechanisms which generate pure spin hall currents in the transverse leads of ballistic devices due to the flow of unpolarized charge current through their longitudinal leads : ( i ) while bond spin currents are non - zero locally within the so coupled region even in equilibrium ( when all leads are at the same potential ) , the total spin current obtained by summing the bond spin currents over an arbitrary cross section is zero so that no spin can actually be transported by such equilibrium currents ; ( ii ) when device is brought into nonequilibrium steady current state by external voltage difference applied between the longitudinal leads , only the wave functions ( or green functions ) around the fermi energy contribute to the total spin current through a given transverse cross section ; ( iii ) the total spin hall current is not conserved within the so coupled region ; however , it becomes conserved and physically well - defined quantity in the ideal leads where it is , furthermore , equal to the spin current obtained within the multiprobe landauer - b \" uttiker scattering formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the local spin current profiles crucially depend on whether the sample is smaller or greater than the spin precession length , thereby demonstrating its essential role as the characteristic mesoscale for the spin hall effect in ballistic multiterminal semiconductor nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> although static spin - independent disorder reduces the magnitude of the total spin current in the leads , the bond spin currents continue to flow through the whole diffusive 2deg sample , without being localized as edge spin currents around any of its boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental observation of the spin hall effect  @xcite opens new avenues for the understanding of fundamental role which spin - orbit ( so ) couplings  @xcite can play in transport and equilibrium properties of semiconductor structures . while so coupling effects are tiny relativistic corrections for particles moving through electric fields in vacuum , they can be enhanced in solids by several orders of magnitude due to the interplay of crystal symmetry and strong crystalline potential .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , harnessing of spin currents induced by the spin hall effect offers new possibilities for the envisioned all - electrical manipulation of spin for semiconductor spintronics applications  @xcite where electrical fields can access individual spins on short length and time scales .    </S>",
    "<S> the principal macroscopic phenomenological manifestation of the spin hall effect is unique : the transverse spin current , which is pure in the sense of not being accompanied by any net charge transport in the transverse direction , emerges as a response to conventional unpolarized charge current in the longitudinal direction through a paramagnetic system in the absence of any external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> when such current hits the sample boundary , it will deposit nonequilibrium spin accumulation  @xcite at the lateral edges of the sample attached to two longitudinal electrodes ,  @xcite as detected optically in recent breakthrough spin hall experiments .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    however , there are several apparently disconnected mechanisms capable of inducing the spin hall currents . nonetheless , they share the necessity for some type of so interaction which couples the spin and charge transport . for example , impurities with so interaction will deflect spin-@xmath0 ( spin-@xmath1 ) conduction electrons predominantly to the left ( right ) in the scattering process , thereby generating the _ extrinsic _ transverse spin hall current . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of the extrinsic spin hall effect has been around for several decades ,  @xcite and it has recently been revisited  @xcite to argue its major role in one of the two recent seminal experimental observations .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the extrinsic effect , which crucially relies on the presence of impurities with skew - scattering and does not involve any so coupling induced modification of the quasiparticle energy spectrum , is a rather small effect ( unless one invokes particular enhancement mechanisms involving intrinsic so coupling in the bulk crystal which contributes a so term to the impurity potential  @xcite ) whose precise magnitude has been tantalizingly hard to estimate .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    thus , a strong impetus for the revival of interest in the realm of the spin hall effect(s ) has ascended from recent predictions for substantial pure spin current flowing through : ( a ) infinite homogeneous so coupled semiconductors in the clean limit ,  @xcite where the strong so coupling induces the spin - splitting of the quasiparticle energies ; or ( b ) the electrodes of multiprobe finite - size mesoscopic nanostructures  @xcite made of such materials . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite reexamination of such unusual features of the intrinsic spin hall current have lead to two major controversies : ( i ) its dependence solely on the whole so coupled fermi sea and the spin - split band structure ( i.e. , the anomalous velocity due to the berry curvature of the bloch states  @xcite ) , without any connection to nonequilibrium distribution function that characterizes standard charge transport in the longitudinal direction ,  @xcite have prompted arguments that such currents do not really transport spin or induce spin accumulation that would be useful for spintronics applications ;  @xcite ( ii ) for linear in momentum so couplings , such as the rashba or linear dresselhaus coupling  @xcite in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , numerous perturbative analytical  @xcite and non - perturbative numerical exact diagonalization  @xcite studies find that bulk intrinsic spin hall current ( averaged over an infinite system  @xcite ) vanishes for arbitrary small disorder , while being able to survive as edge spin current near the sample - electrode interfaces  @xcite or for some intermediate values of the spin - independent disorder strength  @xcite ( for which the sharp boundary between the intrinsic and the extrinsic mechanisms becomes blurred  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the mesoscopic spin hall current , predicted to flow out of ballistic phase - coherent samples of the so coupled semiconductors  @xcite through the attached transverse ideal ( i.e. , free of spin and charge interactions ) leads , is conserved throughout the leads , depends only on the wave functions ( or green functions ) at the fermi surface ( at low temperatures @xmath2 ) , and it is resilient to rather large static disorder within the diffusive metallic regime .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the theory of the _ mesoscopic _ spin hall effect is formulated in terms of the landauer - b \" uttiker - type transmission formalism  @xcite for spin currents ,  @xcite which connects asymptotic scattering states in the leads without requiring any information about the quantum - mechanical probabilities for spin and charge propagation between the two points inside the sample . </S>",
    "<S> technically , to obtain the spin hall current flowing through the leads of a multiterminal device , one only needs the spin - dependent retarded real - space green function connecting the sites residing in different leads and no information about its values between the points within the sample .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    thus , many recent debates on the very existence of the spin hall effect in ballistic so coupled semiconductor systems could be closed by visualizing the spatial details of the spin flow through experimentally accessible hall bridges  from the so coupled sample toward to attached electrodes with no so interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the analogous studies of the spatial distribution of charge flow were essential in understanding the nature of quantum hall transport ( bulk vs. edge  @xcite ) in mesoscopic hall bridges .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , recent advances in multifarious scanning probe experimental techniques have made it possible to go beyond conventional transport measurements of macroscopically averaged quantities and image phase - coherent charge flow through a single 2deg in quantum hall or quantum point contact regime where the host semiconductor heterostructures is subjected to high or zero external magnetic field , respectively .  </S>",
