    "4u  1957 + 11  is a bright , persistent x - ray source with soft x - ray ( 212 kev ) flux levels between 2070 milli - crab since its discovery in 1973 @xcite .",
    "yet surprisingly little is known about this binary system .",
    "while the lack of x - ray eclipses in this system suggests that the orbital inclination is likely less than 85 , modeling the optical modulation gives only a weak constraint of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "neither the distance to the system nor the accretor s mass is well known . however , examining the equivalent width of the neix 13.45  line created in the ism , @xcite and @xcite have suggested a minimum distance of 5 kpc . in the absence of any dynamical mass measurement , analysis of x - ray / optical data from the source at various points of time have suggested that it could either be a neutron star @xcite or a black hole @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the optical light curve of 4u  1957 + 11  varies with time .",
    "however observations densely sampled in time reveals a modulation with 9.33 hour period , which is usually thought to be the orbital period of this system @xcite .",
    "the column density ( n@xmath6 ) in the direction of 4u  1957 + 11  is quite small ( 12@xmath7@xmath8 atoms @xmath9 ) , providing a clear view of the disk .",
    "furthermore , the high - resolution grating data obtained by _ chandra_and _ xmm - newton _ , and analyzed by @xcite , show only absorption lines due to the ism and no lines intrinsic to the source .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the entire set of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( rxte ) observations , as well as _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations of this source .",
    "more recently @xcite have also presented their analysis of _ suzaku _  data of this source . the predominantly soft spectrum and",
    "very low fractional variability @xcite are characteristic of 4u  1957 + 11  being in a canonical soft state .",
    "recent radio non - detection of 4u  1957 + 11  with an upper limit of of 11.4 @xmath10jy / beam using the _ jansky very large array _ ( jvla ) at 57 ghz by @xcite is also consistent with the prevalent wisdom , a.k.a . the jet  disk paradigm , where jet production is strongly quenched in sources that are in a soft state .",
    "recent works critically examining the x - ray spectral and timing properties using _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and rxte @xcite have suggested that the system harbors a black hole , and that it may be the fastest spinning hole known so far . in this work",
    "we _ assume _ that the accretor is a bh and test the validity of this assumption under a wide range of plausible parameter space .",
    "we present the details of the _ swift _",
    "observations and data analysis in ",
    "[ s : data ] .",
    "we then discuss spectral modeling in ",
    "[ s : analysis ] , starting with simple , phenomenological accretion disk plus power law models in  [ ss : diskbb_po ] and then moving towards more physically motivated disk models in  [ ss : kerrbb ] .",

    "[ ss : chisq ] and that using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations is presented in  [ ss : mcmc ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in  [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "as part of the _ swift _  observatory s @xcite _ guest observing _ program number 7100116 , 4u  1957 + 11  was observed 21 times between mjd 5570055890 ( 2011 may 19 2011 november 25 ) .",
    "prior to this monitoring campaign 4u  1957 + 11  was also observed 5 times with _",
    "swift_. with an average flux of @xmath11 erg / s/@xmath12 , the source is quite bright in the x - ray telescope s bandpass ( xrt , @xcite ) .",
    "thereofre these observations were carried out in _ windowed timing _ ( wt ) mode to avoid pileup .",
    "the observation logs are presented in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the data extraction and reduction were performed using the heasoft software ( v6.12 ) developed and maintained by nasa s high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) .",
    "we followed the extraction steps outlined in @xcite .",
    "the raw data were reprocessed using the ` xrtpipeline ` command to ensure that the latest instrument calibrations and responses were used .",
    "since data were collected in wt mode , events were extracted from a rectangular region containing the source .",
    "neighboring source - free regions were used to extract background spectra .",
    "the ` xrtexpomap ` task was used to generate exposure maps which were then applied to the extracted data . while we used the response matrices ( rmf )",
    "supplied with the latest calibration database , custom ancillary response function ( arf ) files for every observation were created using ` xrtmkarf ` task . as per the swift xrt caldb release note a systematic error of 3% was added to the spectra using the ` set_sys_err_frac ` command in isis .",
    "in the simplest case we model the spectra with the standardly used multi - temperature thermal accretion disk ( ` diskbb ` in xspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plus a power law component ( ` powerlaw ` in xspec ) , modified by photoelectric absorption ( ` phabs ` in xspec ) due to atoms present in the intervening interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we used the @xcite abundance table and @xcite photoelectric absorption cross - sections ( with a new he cross - section based on @xcite ) to compute the photoelectric absorption spectra .",
    "the results of this spectral decomposition are shown in figs .",
    "[ f : diskbb_po_diskpars][f : diskbb_po_fluxes ] , and summarized in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the fit parameters we obtain are quite similar to the numbers obtained previously by @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite during their analysis of the _ rxte _ data of this source .",
    "the spectra are predominantly thermal .",
    "in fact , for the observation on mjd 55525 which was the last of a batch of pointings between mjd 5551655525 , the disk plus power law decomposition fails to find any nonthermal contribution .",
    "the remarkable combination of low column density and absence of narrow spectral features led @xcite to conclude `` 4u  1957 + 11  may be the cleanest disk spectrum with which to study modern disk atmosphere models '' .",
    "we therefore used a second set of models where the observed emission in the _ swift _ bandpass ( and given the limited spectral resolution of the ccd chip ) was entirely attributed to a thermal accretion disk .",
    "as in the case of the phenomenological model described above , we assumed that the intrinsic spectrum was modified by photoelectric absorption ( ` phabs ` ) along the way .",
    "for the accretion disk we used the ` kerrbb ` model by @xcite which models a thin , steady state , general relativistic accretion disk around a kerr black hole .",
    "while we encourage the reader to refer to the original work for the details of the model , we give a brief summary of the relevant model parameters here to provide a context .",
    "the model normalization was set to unity because the disk s inclination ( @xmath13 ) , the black hole s mass ( m@xmath14 ) , and the source distance ( @xmath15 ) were frozen during the analysis .",
    "the flags to switch effects of self - irradiation and limb - darkening were turned on for all the fits .",
    "the ratio of the disk power produced by torque at the disk s inner boundary to the disk power arising from accretion ( @xmath16 ) was set to 0 which corresponds to a standard keplerian disk with zero torque at the inner boundary .",
    "the above parameters were fixed for all fits .",
    "the black hole s dimensionless spin parameter ( @xmath17 ) was determined from the fits .",
    "similarly the mass accretion rate of the disk ( @xmath18 ) , and the spectral hardening factor @xmath19=@xmath20 were also determined via fitting . here",
    "@xmath21 is the color temperature inferred from the spectra and @xmath22 is the effective temperature .",
    "as discussed in greater detail in @xcite , the spectral hardening factor essentially parametrizes the uncertainties in our understanding of the disk atmosphere .",
    "previous works on other sources ( e.g. , see , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) prefer @xmath23 ( though also see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for fits to data where a higher @xmath24is preferred ) .      for traditional @xmath0",
    "fitting we chose multiple , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets spanning a wide range of masses ( 5 , 10 , and 15 m@xmath3 ) , distances ( 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 kpc ) , and inclinations ( 55 , 65 , 75 , and 85 ) .",
    "thus a total of 48 , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets were explored .",
    "inclinations lower than 55  result in fits that are progressively worse fits , and therefore not considered .",
    "the absence of x - ray eclipses put an upper limit of 85  on the inclination . similarly , examining the equivalent width of the neix 13.45  line created in the ism , @xcite and @xcite have estimated a minimum distance of 5 kpc to this source . while fitting any of these triplets , the values of m@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath13",
    "were also kept constant .",
    "thus the only free disk parameters in our modeling are @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath18",
    ".    however , the values of these free parameters are not completely unconstrained : it is extremely unlikely that @xmath25  changed appreciably over the @xmath26year timescale of the observations .",
    "therefore for our joint fits ( see details below ) the value of @xmath25  was tied to be the same across all observations . in other words ,",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath25  was determined from the data , but this value was required to be the same for all observations . as in the case of @xmath25 , it is again extremely unlikely that the column density of the intervening material changed over a timescale of years .",
    "therefore the column density of hydrogen ( n@xmath6  in ` phabs ` ) was also tied to be the same in all observations .",
    "thus the only disk parameters that were free from observation to observation were @xmath18  and @xmath24 .",
    "for every , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplet we performed a joint fit to all 26 _ swift_observations .",
    "this implies that for every fit there were 54 free parameters whose best - fit values were determined by fitting ( one value of @xmath18  and one value of @xmath24  for every observation @xmath27 52 parameters , plus one value each of n@xmath6  and @xmath25 ) .",
    "we rebinned the spectra such that every bin had a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of at least 4.5 , and used good data in the 0.510 kev energy range where calibration of _",
    "s ccd is best known .",
    "after rebinning and energy filtering , a total of 14,876 spectral bins ( from all 26 observations ) were used for joint spectral fitting .",
    "therefore the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath28 ) while jointly fitting all the observations for a given , @xmath15 , @xmath13triplet is @xmath28=14,822 .",
    "traditional @xmath0 minimization was carried out using the isis software package ( v1.6.2 - 18 * ? ? ?",
    "isis not only loads the entire library of models included in the xspec @xcite package , but also allows parallelized fitting and distributed computation of single - parameter confidence limits in a cluster environment ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "further speedup is gained by using model caching methods in isis so that computationally expensive models are not recomputed unless needed .",
    "we used the ` galaxy ` cluster at the university of michigan to carry out fitting and distributed computation of single - parameter confidence limits . using the parallelization scheme outlined above",
    ", we determined the best - fitting parameter values as well as their confidence intervals .",
    "our confidence intervals correspond to @xmath29= 2.71 for a given parameter ( for normal distribution this would imply a single parameter confidence limit of 90% ) .",
    "given the plethora of model fits ( 48 , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets , and 26 spectra for each triplet @xmath27 1248 spectral fits ) , we include only a sample of fit results in this paper ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ f : m10_d10 ] ) .",
    "the complete set of results including ( a ) best - fit model parameters for every , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplet , ( b ) best - fit spectral models for every observation showing the data , model , and residuals , and ( c ) time variation of @xmath18  and @xmath24  for every , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplet , are available online .    for easy exploration of the results",
    "we have created heat maps that show the changes in fit statistics as well as best - fit parameters for the different , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets .",
    "[ f : heat - chisq ] shows the heat maps based on best - fit reduced-@xmath0 values , @xmath13triplets have 14822 degrees of freedom , any of the reduced @xmath0 values can be multiplied by this factor to obtain the actual @xmath0 value ] .",
    "each , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplet is represented by a square whose color is indicative of the best - fit reduced-@xmath0 obtained by simultaneously fitting all 26 observations .",
    "note that an inclination of @xmath2675is statistically preferred irrespective of the black hole s mass .    since we assume a standard keplerian disk with zero torque at the inner boundary , the total disk luminosity for the models is given by @xmath30 .",
    "here @xmath31 is the radiation efficiency of the disk around the accretor and depends on the spin ( see , e.g. figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to calculate the fractional eddington luminosity from the model fits .",
    "since the ` kerrbb ` model takes into account relativistic effects like doppler beaming , deflection of light under strong gravity ( and the resulting `` returning radiation '' ) , and gravitational redshift , as well as incorporating additional physics such as limb - darkening and self - irradiation of the disk , this estimation of @xmath32  is significantly better than simply estimating it from the observed flux .",
    "thus , e.g. in fig .",
    "[ f : m10_d10 ] ( and also online ) , we show not only the time - variation of @xmath24  and @xmath18  for a sample of , @xmath15 , @xmath13triplets , but also the corresponding values of @xmath32 . as discussed in greater detail in  [ s : conclusion ] , the @xmath32  ratio is also helpful in constraining the ranges of the black hole and binary parameters since we expect bh binaries in soft state to have @xmath32  greater than a few percent typically .    in figs .",

    "we find that the best - fit @xmath25  dramatically changes from maximal retrograde spin at lower inclinations ( 55  and 65 ) to maximal prograde spin at higher inclinations ( 75  and 85 ) .",
    "this rapid flip is seen for all assumed distances ( i.e. between 520 kpc ) .",
    "intermediate spins are however obtained for higher black hole masses if the inclination is low .    as discussed in the previous section , @xmath24",
    "was allowed to vary between the observations . therefore for every , @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath13  triplet we have 26 best - fit values of @xmath24 .",
    "but as fig .",
    "[ f : m10_d10 ] ( and similar figures for other fits available online ) show , the variation in @xmath24  between observations is quite small and the average value is a good indicator of the spectral hardening for a given triplet .",
    "we show the variation of average @xmath24 in the top - right panels of figs .",
    "[ f : heat-5m][f : heat-15 m ] .",
    "the color scheme of the @xmath24  heat maps is such that generally acceptable @xmath24values ( @xmath261.52.5 ) would be green in color .",
    "progressively higher ( and probably physically implausible ) values are denoted by orange and then red .",
    "irrespective of m@xmath14 , we find that fits assuming lower inclinations result in very large @xmath24 , making them less likely .",
    "for higher inclinations , we find that the region of ` acceptable ' @xmath24  values move progressively from 510 kpc for 5m@xmath3  to higher distances for higher black hole masses .    in the bottom - left panel of figs .",
    "[ f : heat-5m][f : heat-15 m ] we show heat maps based on average values of eddington fraction . as fig .",
    "[ f : m10_d10 ] shows , the variations in @xmath32  from observation to observation is larger than the variations in @xmath24 , but still less than a factor of @xmath262 . on the other hand ,",
    "the average value itself changes by @xmath263 orders of magnitude across the , @xmath15 , @xmath13  parameter space we have explored . therefore these heat maps show the general ballpark regime where the @xmath32  values lie for any given , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplet . as discussed in  [ s : conclusion ] , this helps in constraining the ranges of the parameter space . while these heat maps show values of @xmath32  estimated by the ` k`errbb model , fig .",
    "[ f : heat - ledd - simple ] shows the expected range in @xmath32  if the x - ray emission is isotropic . to create these maps",
    "we have simply assumed that the x - ray flux from the source was @xmath33=1.5@xmath710@xmath34 erg s@xmath35 @xmath9 ( the average flux level in our observations ) .",
    "then for a given , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplet the @xmath32is given by @xmath36    in the bottom - right panel of figs .",
    "[ f : heat-5m][f : heat-15 m ] we show the heat maps based on values of n@xmath6  that we obtain from our fits to the different , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets .",
    "these figures show that lower inclinations prefer higher columns .",
    "also there are some hints of decreasing column with increasing distance .",
    "the range of n@xmath6  we obtain is consistent with independent observations made with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  @xcite .      while the traditional @xmath0  fitting method narrowed down the region of the parameter space with statistically better fits , the parameter space itself was sampled quite coarsely ( only at discrete , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath0  fitting technique becomes extremely computationally expensive for problems such as ours that involve a large number of free parameters .",
    "we therefore used mcmc simulations to estimate the best parameter values , the errors in these parameters , and to study correlations between different parameters . as we will see below",
    ", the mcmc validates the results from traditional @xmath0  fitting , and that these two techniques converge towards the same results further strengthens our conclusions .",
    "we used an in - house isis script that implements affine - invariant ensemble sampler for mcmc proposed by @xcite , in a manner similar to the _ emcee _ python package developed by @xcite .",
    "the key advantages of the goodman - weare algorithm over the commonly used metropolis - hastings algorithm are that the goodman - weare algorithm does not require a choice of proposal distribution , and also the goodman - weare algorithm can be easily parallelized in a cluster computing environment .",
    "we used all the 24 cpu cores of one compute node of the ` zephyr ` cluster at wheaton college to carry out the mcmc computations .",
    "the starting point for the mcmc is the best - fit solution obtained using conventional @xmath0  fitting for the , @xmath15 , @xmath13=\\{10 , 10 , 75 } triplet .",
    "an ensemble of model parameter sets , called walkers , are then started in a small ball around the best - fit solution . for our data",
    "set we started with 10 walkers per free parameter .",
    "in addition to the 54 free parameters already described above in the section on @xmath0  fitting , we also allowed the mass of the accretor , distance to the system , and the inclination to vary in the mcmc simulations .",
    "thus the total number of walkers in our simulations were 540 .",
    "the mcmc simulations explored the following parameter ranges : @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38\\times10^{18}$ ] @xmath39 , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] @xmath42 , @xmath43 $ ] kpc , @xmath44 $ ] , and @xmath45\\times10^{22}$ ] @xmath9 .",
    "it required about 27,000 steps for the ensemble of walkers in the simulation to attain equillibrium .",

[",

    "the correlation between these parameters can be qualitatively explained via the following line of reasoning : the more face on the disk is , the more we see its inner regions @xmath27 the spectrum will be more strongly affected by gravitational redshift and appear softer @xmath27 the more n@xmath6we need to keep the same spectrum , or the more spin to boost it up to slightly higher temperature .",
    "overall , the mcmc results are completely consistent with the @xmath0  fitting results ( but the mcmc technique , being better suited to address problems with large number of free parameters than @xmath0  fitting , gives more precise results ) .",
    "the convergence of the two techniques give additional confidence not only about the implementation of the techniques but also our the conclusions .",

    "s _ xrt _ , where we analyze the data using traditional @xmath0  fitting technique as well as using mcmc simulations .",
    "while present computational resources make it prohibitively expensive to explore a finer grid of the parameter space using traditional @xmath0technique , the mcmc simulations validate the trends suggested by @xmath0fitting and allow us to explore the parameters much more precisely and also study the correlation between various model parameters .",
    "both techniques point toward a relatively high - inclination of the inner accretion disk .",
    "the @xmath0  fitting , which could be done only on a coarse grid of , @xmath15 , @xmath13  triplets due to computational limits , prefers an inclination of @xmath2675 .",
    "not only are the @xmath0  values smallest at @xmath13@xmath2675  ( among the grid points separated by 10 in inclination ) , but the spectral hardening factor also lies in an ` acceptable ' range ( @xmath261.52.5 ) for @xmath13@xmath2675 .",
    "the mcmc simulations , which prefer @xmath13=@xmath1  degrees , put the most stringent constraint on the inclination of the x - ray emitting disk so far .",
    "this is consistent with the previous upper limit of @xmath2685based on the absence of any x - ray eclipse .",
    "this inclination can also be considered marginally consistent with the optical results where @xcite and @xcite concluded that the orbital inclination was `` nearly unconstrained with permitted inclinations of @xmath2620@xmath4770 '' .",
    "we would however like to point out that the inclination we measure in this work is that of the very innermost parts of the accretion disk , closest to that of the black hole . since the spin very high",
    ", we expect that this inclination is also what the black hole s spin axis makes to our line of sight due to bardeen - petterson @xcite effect . if the direction of the black hole s spin angular momentum vector is different from that of the angular momentum vector of the binary orbit ( which is measured from optical observations ) , that could explain any discrepancy between the inclination measured in x - rays and optical .    the mcmc simulations point to a spectral hardening factor ranging between 1.92.1 for the minimum @xmath0  model .",
    "while this value is somewhat higher than the generally accepted value of @xmath261.7 , recent works , e.g. by @xcite and @xcite , have reported sources where a higher @xmath24  was required by the data .",
    "additionally we note from the @xmath0  analysis that this ` acceptable ' range of @xmath24moves from low distances for low m@xmath14  to high distances for high m@xmath14(see .",
    "e.g the heat maps in figs .",
    "[ f : heat-5m][f : heat-15 m ] ) .",
    "when an independent measurement of either the accretor s mass or the system distance is available in the future , the above correlation can be used to put a weak constraint on the other .",
    "the fact that two extreme values of spin ( maximal prograde for higher inclination and maximal retrograde for lower inclinations ) are prefered in the traditional @xmath0  treatment points to a degeneracy in the fit - parameters .",
    "retrograde spin moves the isco outward , and thus drops the temperature , but that is made up for by the high color - correction factor .",
    "fewer photons ( per unit area ) are emitted by a disk with an intrinsically lower @xmath48 , but the total photon count - rate is compensated by the larger emitting area of a disk with larger inner radius .",
    "but in this case , the spectra clearly have high characterisic @xmath48 photons because increasing the emitting area alone is not sufficient to obtain good fits ; hence the need for a large color - correction factor .",
    "this degeneracy is handled much better in mcmc simulations where even though we searched the full range of possible spins , the near maximal prograde spin is strongly favored over other scenarios , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : parcor ] and table  [ tab : mcmcglobalres ] .",
    "the mcmc solutions indicate a maximally spinning black hole , with a 90% confidence lower limit of 0.98 .",
    "even this lower limit is extremely close to the canonical maximum value of @xmath25=0.998 calculated by @xcite for a geometrically thin , radiatively efficient accretion disk .",
    "other configurations however may allow higher @xmath25 .",
    "for example , black holes that harbor a thick , partially pressure supported disk envisioned by @xcite might have @xmath25@xmath20.998 .",
    "@xcite have argued that the impact of captured disk radiation by the black hole is neglgible at high accretion rates , which can also push @xmath25  beyond 0.998 .",
    "1.1 of @xcite for a summary of works by various authors on the question of maximum spin of black holes . since 4u  1957 + 11",
    "persistently accretes in soft state , it is likely that it accretes at a significant fration of the eddington rate .",
    "although absence of strong disk winds may disfavor an @xmath26eddington or super - eddington scenario .",
    "thus while extremely high spins are not physically implausible , we note that deviations of the real accretion disk from the theoretical model we used , and/or some calibration uncertainty may also lead to high - spin solutions .",
    "given that 4u  1957 + 11  has been observed using multiple x - ray missions and recent data from all of these point to high spin ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
