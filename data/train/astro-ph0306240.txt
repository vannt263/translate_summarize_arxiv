    "brown dwarfs , which straddle the mass range between stars and planets , appear to be common both in the field and in star - forming regions . their ubiquity makes the question of their origin an important one , both for our understanding of brown dwarfs themselves as well as for theories on the formation of stars and planets .    in the standard framework , a low - mass star forms out of a collapsing cloud fragment , and goes through a `` t tauri phase '' , during which it accretes material from a surrounding disk , before arriving on the main sequence",
    "there is ample observational evidence now to support many key aspects of this picture for young solar - mass stars .",
    "whether the same scenario holds for objects at and below the sub - stellar limit is an open question .",
    "studies of _ young _ sub - stellar objects could provide valuable clues to address that question .    to that end , over the past year , we have undertaken a multi - faceted study of very low mass ( vlm ) objects in star - forming regions and their immediate circumstellar environment .",
    "here we report on our investigations of accretion signatures and disk excess in young brown dwarfs .",
    "the shape and width of the h@xmath3 emission profile is commonly used to discriminate between accretors and non - accretors among t tauri stars ( tts ) .",
    "stars exhibiting broad , asymmetric h@xmath3 lines with equivalent width larger than 10    are generally categorized as classical tts ( ctts ) , although this threshold value varies with spectral type .",
    "recently white & basri ( 2003 ) have suggested that a full - width @xmath4 270 kms@xmath5 at 10% of the peak emission is a better empirical indicator of accretion , independent of spectral type . however , we find that in vlm accretors , the h@xmath3 profile may be somewhat narrower than that in higher mass stars .",
    "we propose that low accretion rates combined with small infall velocities at very low masses can conspire to produce this effect , and adopt @xmath0 200 kms@xmath5 as a more appropriate , yet conservative , threshold ( see jayawardhana , mohanty & basri 2003 for further discussion ) .",
    "we obtained high - resolution keck optical spectra of @xmath030 objects spanning the range of m5m8 in ic 348 , taurus , upper scorpius and @xmath6 ophiuchus star - forming regions .",
    "putting together now all the young objects near or below the substellar boundary ( @xmath0 m5 and later ) with published high - resolution optical spectra ( jayawardhana , mohanty & basri 2002 ; 2003 and references therein ) , we have 4 objects in @xmath6 ophiuchus , 10 in ic 348 , 14 in taurus and 11 in upper scorpius . of these",
    ", optical spectral signatures of accretion are found in 1 object in @xmath6 oph ( gy 5 ) , 5 in ic 348 ( ic 348 - 165 , 205 , 355 , 415 , 382 ; fig .",
    "1 ) , 3 in taurus ( cida-1 , gm tau , v410 anon 13 ) and 1 in upper sco ( usco 75 ) , adopting an accretion cutoff of @xmath0 200 kms@xmath5 in 10% width of the h@xmath3 line .",
    "the vast majority of @xmath6 oph vlm objects were inaccessible to our optical spectroscopy because of significant extinction , presumably due to circumstellar as well as interstellar material .",
    "thus , our ( small ) @xmath6 oph sample is heavily biased against possible accretors , and should not be used to estimate the accreting fraction . considering the other three clusters ,",
    "which are much less affected by this bias , we find that @xmath050% of the vlm objects show disk accretion at an age @xmath7 2 myr ( ic 348 ) , @xmath0 20% at age @xmath0 3 myr ( taurus ) , and @xmath710% by @xmath0 5 myr ( upper sco ) . while there are uncertainties in the cluster ages , ic 348 is likely to be younger than taurus and upper sco .",
    "thus , we appear to be seeing a decrease in the fraction of accreting young sub - stellar objects with increasing age .",
    "interestingly , three of our @xmath0 m6 ic 348 targets with broad h@xmath3 also harbor broad oi ( 8446 ) and caii ( 8662 ) emission ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and one shows broad hei ( 6678 ) emission ; these features are usually seen in strongly accreting classical t tauri stars .",
    "our results constitute the most compelling evidence to date that young brown dwarfs undergo a t tauri - like accretion phase similar to that in low - mass stars .",
    "excesses at infrared wavelengths provide readily a measurable signature of dusty disks around late - type objects . using the eso very large telescope , keck i and the nasa infrared telescope facility , we have carried out a systematic study of infrared @xmath1-band ( 3.8@xmath2 m ) disk excess in a large sample of _ spectroscopically confirmed _ objects near and below the sub - stellar boundary in several nearby star - forming regions ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "our longer - wavelength observations are much better at detecting disk excess above the photospheric emission and are less susceptible to the effects of disk geometry and extinction corrections than @xmath8 studies ( also see liu , najita & tokunaga 2003 ) .",
    "we find disk fractions of 40%60% in ic 348 , chamaeleon i , taurus and upper scorpius regions .",
    "based on iso observations , natta & testi ( 2001 ) have already shown that cha h@xmath3 1 , chah@xmath3 2 and chah@xmath3 9 harbor mid - infrared spectral energy distributions consistent with the presence of dusty disks .",
    "chah@xmath3 2 , which shows a large @xmath9 excess ( 0.97 mag ) in our data is a probable close ( @xmath00.2  ) binary with roughly equal - mass companions ( neuhuser et al .",
    "it is possible that a few of our targets harbor infrared companions that contribute to the measured excess , but this is unlikely in most cases .",
    "the disk fractions we report for ic 348 and taurus are lower than those found by liu , najita & tokunaga ( 2003 ) .",
    "this is primarily because we use a more conservative criterion of @xmath10 0.2 for the presence of optically thick disks whereas liu et al .",
    "consider all objects with @xmath10 0 as harboring disks . in ic 348 ,",
    "our disk fraction is comparable to that derived from h@xmath3 accretion signatures in high - resolution optical spectra ( jayawardhana , mohanty & basri 2003 ) .",
    "however , in taurus and upper sco , which may be slightly older at @xmath02 - 5 myrs , we find @xmath9 excess in @xmath050% of the targets whereas only three out of 14 taurus vlm objects and one out of 11 upper sco sources exhibit accretion - like h@xmath3 ( jayawardhana , mohanty & basri 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "this latter result suggests that dust disks may persist after accretion has ceased or been reduced to a trickle , as also suggested by haisch , lada & lada ( 2001 ) .    in the somewhat older ( @xmath05 myr ) @xmath11 orionis cluster , only about a third of the targets show infrared excess .",
    "neither of the two brown dwarf candidate members of the @xmath010-myr - old tw hydrae association ( gizis 2002 ) shows excess . gizis ( 2002 ) reported strong h@xmath3 emission ( equivalent width @xmath12 300  ) from one of the tw hydrae objects , the m8 dwarf 2massw j1207334 - 393254 , and suggested it could be due to either accretion or chromospheric activity .",
    "given the lack of measurable @xmath9 excess in this object , accretion now appears less likely as the cause of its strong h@xmath3 emission .",
    "our findings in the @xmath11 ori and tw hya associations , albeit for a small sample of objects , could mean that the inner disks are clearing out by the age of these groups .",
    "similar results have been found for t tauri stars in the tw hydrae association ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "1999 ) .    our results , and those of muench et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , natta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and liu , najita & tokunaga ( 2003 ) show that a large fraction of very young brown dwarfs harbor near- and mid - infrared excesses consistent with dusty disks . while the samples are still relatively small , the timescales for inner disk depletion do not appear to be vastly different between brown dwarfs and t tauri stars .",
    "far - infrared observations with the _ space infrared telescope facility _ and/or the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ will be crucial for deriving the sizes of circum - sub - stellar disks and providing a more definitive test of the ejection hypothesis for the origin of brown dwarfs",
    ".    we would like to acknowledge the great cultural significance of mauna kea for native hawaiians , and express our gratitude for permission to observe from its summit .",
    "we thank geoff marcy for useful discussions , constant encouragement and access to keck ( for the @xmath1 observations ) and kevin luhman for valuable assistance during the december 2002 keck run .",
    "we are grateful to the staff members of the vlt , keck and irtf observatories for their outstanding support .",
    "we also thank fernando comern and staff at the eso user support group for their prompt responses to our queries .",
