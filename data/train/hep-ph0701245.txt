    "hadron masses reveal key aspects of qcd .",
    "the light pseudoscalar meson masses reveal the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry as well as its explicit breaking by the light quark masses , and in a rather direct manner they permit to extract the ratios of these quark masses which are fundamental parameters of qcd .",
    "they also give access to the electromagnetic contributions to the masses , for instance , in the mass difference between charged and neutral pions . in the framework of chiral perturbation theory , a rather accurate understanding of the effects of light quark masses and electromagnetic corrections on the pseudoscalar octet has been achieved , and to a lesser extent in baryons as well .",
    "heavy mesons represent another kind of hadronic system where one can arrive at a good determination of the various effects that determine their masses .",
    "also , to a first degree of approximation in the heavy quark expansion , the strong hyperfine effects , which involve the heavy quark spin , serve to determine the ratio @xmath4 , which is another fundamental input in qcd . in this work , we show that the current knowledge of the heavy meson masses allows for a quantitative determination of the different effects that contribute to the differences of heavy meson masses .",
    "the approach followed here is similar to the one given by rosner and wise @xcite , and the improvement in the results is possible thanks to the better empirical accuracy in the heavy meson masses and also in the better knowledge of the heavy quark masses .    in the limit of infinite heavy quark masses and of light quark @xmath5 symmetry ,",
    "heavy mesons fill multiplets of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of heavy quarks , @xmath8 is the rotation group associated with the light degrees of freedom of the heavy meson . in particular , the ground state mesons , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , fill the multiplet @xmath9 of that symmetry .",
    "the symmetry is broken by several effects :    * the finite masses of the heavy _",
    "c _ and _ b _ quarks break @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the rotation group is associated with the spin of the meson .",
    "* the light quark masses break @xmath12 . *",
    "the em interactions break all symmetry subgroups down to @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis in this work has the objective of sorting out these three sources of symmetry breaking from the current knowledge of the heavy meson masses .",
    "the analysis only involves meson mass differences .",
    "those in the @xmath0 mesons are very well known with errors smaller than 2.5% @xcite . in the @xmath2 mesons ,",
    "not all mass splittings are established ; the mass differences @xmath14 and @xmath15 are not separately known and , in addition , the errors are significantly larger than in the d - system @xcite . nonetheless , the available information is sufficient for the analysis to lead to significant conclusions .",
    "the analysis is based on the mass formuli that result from the expansions in @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the heavy quark mass @xmath18 , in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and in the fine structure constant @xmath21 .",
    "these mass formuli are similar to the ones given long ago by rosner and wise @xcite , except that the qcd running of some of the parameters are taken into account . using the notation @xmath22 , etc .",
    ", they read as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote respectively the light and heavy quark flavors of the heavy meson , the label @xmath26 is used for the vector mesons , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the respectively the light and heavy quark charges .    the first term in the mass formula is made out of the contributions in the limit @xmath29 and @xmath30 plus @xmath5 singlet contributions by light quark masses , _",
    "i.e. _ given in terms of @xmath31 , and by electromagnetism .",
    "these @xmath5 symmetric contributions are simply absorbed into the coefficients that determine @xmath32 in eqn.(2 ) below .",
    "our analysis can not determine those contributions separately .",
    "the second term in the mass formula provides the @xmath5 breaking effects by the quark masses to first order , and the last two terms provide the @xmath5 breaking by the electromagnetic interaction , the first one representing the electromagnetic self - energy of the light antiquark , and the second one is the electromagnetic interaction between light antiquark and heavy quark . throughout",
    ", @xmath17 represents the heavy quark pole mass .",
    "up to @xmath33 , the @xmath16 expansion gives for @xmath34 : @xmath35 for dimensional purposes , we use the @xmath36-meson mass as the reference mass scale .",
    "the explicitly displayed terms @xmath37 and higher represent the mass difference produced by the strong hyperfine interaction .",
    "@xmath38 has a non - trivial dependence on @xmath17 that results from the qcd running of the effective heavy quark operator in the @xmath16 expansion associated with it .",
    "the heavy quark effective lagrangian in the @xmath16 expansion is given in standard notation by @xcite : @xmath39 where the third term , which couples to the heavy quark spin , gives rise to @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the renormalization scale , is given by @xcite : @xmath43 with the initial condition given by the matching to full qcd @xcite : @xmath44 here @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the first coefficient of the @xmath48-function with @xmath49 the number of flavors lighter than @xmath17 . because @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath50",
    ", we can express it in the following renormalization group invariant form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is @xmath17 and @xmath42 independent . in what follows ,",
    "all over - lined coefficients are @xmath17 and @xmath42 independent .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath53 receives contributions from two terms in the heavy quark lagrangian at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the running of @xmath53 with @xmath17 is thus impossible in this analysis .",
    "fortunately , this is not important because the @xmath54 terms play a minor role in the @xmath2 mesons , and thus neglecting the running of the @xmath53 is a good approximation .    for the light quark mass effects , @xmath55",
    "is defined in @xmath56 scheme and one has : @xmath57 because the spin - independent term in the @xmath58 heavy quark lagrangian is scale independent , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are independent of @xmath17 and their dependence on @xmath42 is given by the running of @xmath55 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 , @xmath62 . on the other hand , because @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath50 , it has an extra running factor similar to that of @xmath40 : @xmath64 the @xmath42 dependence given above is rather immaterial in our analysis , where the same @xmath42 is used for @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons .    in the case of electromegnetic effects , we need to discuss seperately the two terms . the coefficients of the self - energy can be expressed in the following most general form : @xmath65 we note that @xmath66 will run with @xmath17 in a similar form as @xmath40 .",
    "the spin of the heavy quark will affect very little the self - energy term , and therefore @xmath66 will be small . as shown later ,",
    "@xmath66 can be eliminated because of linear dependencies , which means that the effect associated with it can not be distinguished from other effects on the meson masses .    on the other hand , the electromagnetic terms involving the interaction between the light degrees of freedom and the heavy quark",
    "have the form : @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 give the leading and subleading in @xmath16 contributions to the coulomb interaction , and both are scale independent as it is known from the renormalization of current operators of the heavy quark , such as the electromagnetic current .",
    "the electromagnetic hyperfine effect proportional to @xmath70 can be expressed as follows : @xmath71 it receives contributions from two general types of diagrams shown in fig ( 1 ) . the first term results from the coupling of the photon to the heavy quark spin and therefore it has no @xmath17 dependence , while the second term corresponds to the coupling of a gluon to the heavy quark spin , and is therefore proportional to @xmath50 and thus @xmath17 dependent .",
    "in this analysis , we consider the five different mass splittings possible in each multiplet , _ i.e. _ @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and similarly for b - system .",
    "the mass formuli leave one parameter independent mass relation , which reads : @xmath77 where we denote @xmath78 .",
    "this mass relation is violated by terms @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "note that this relation was discovered in ref.@xcite , where the evolution factor @xmath83 was not included .",
    "if one disregards the term @xmath33 in the strong hyperfine interaction , _ i.e. _ the term proportional to @xmath53 , one obtains an additional relation : @xmath84 the deviations from this relation are a measure of the importance of the @xmath85 term in the hyperfine interaction .    in the mass formuli",
    ", there is a total of twelve parameters that enter in mass differences .",
    "since there are ten mass differences and one parameter free mass relation , there must be three linearly dependent terms in the mass formuli that we can eliminate .",
    "the linear dependencies are such that @xmath86 and @xmath69 can be absorbed into @xmath87 and @xmath68 , and @xmath88 into @xmath38 and @xmath89 .",
    "since no dependencies appear if one stays at leading order in @xmath16 , it is natural to eliminate sub - leading terms .",
    "we , therefore , eliminate therefore @xmath86 , @xmath90 and @xmath69 .",
    "the linear dependencies imply that , in this analysis , one can not determine the @xmath16 corrections to the self - energy and to the coulomb effects independently from other effects . in what follows , we therefore set : @xmath91    the quark masses are the key input parameters in the mass formuli .",
    "if we would only keep up to @xmath58 terms , the ratio @xmath92 would determine @xmath93 for @xmath94 gev .",
    "there are more accurate determinations of the ratio @xmath4 from the analysis of charmonium and bottomonium @xcite that give @xmath95 and @xmath96 gev . with this ratio ,",
    "it becomes necessary to include the @xmath33 term in eqn .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( 12 ) could be used to extract the ratio @xmath4 , but it requires a precision in the mass differences involved that is far beyond the current precision . for the light quark mass inputs ,",
    "we only need their ratios , namely , @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , which have been extensively studied in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . the first ratio is obtained from the ratio @xmath100 , which after next to leading order chiral corrections , gives a value of @xmath101 , and the second ratio requires the input of isospin breaking observables , in particular the mass ratio @xmath102 , and the rates for @xmath103 , with a result @xmath104 @xcite . for further reference",
    ", this latter ratio corresponds to having the electromagnetic mass difference @xmath105 mev .",
    "the final input is @xmath106 required by @xmath107 ; we use @xmath108 mev .    with our inputs for the heavy quark masses ,",
    "we obtain for the left hand side of eqn .",
    "( 13 ) a value equal to @xmath109 , which gives some evidence for the need of the @xmath33 term in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) . for eqn . ( 13 ) to hold , it would be necessary to have @xmath93 . from eqn .",
    "( 12 ) we obtain the combination : @xmath110 which is not known experimentally because the mass difference @xmath15 has not been established separately from the one for charged ones .",
    "the improvement over similar prediction given in @xcite is primarily due to the improved accuracy of the various inputs , especially the heavy quark masses and the running effect characterized by the factor @xmath83 .    in table",
    "i , we give the results of our fits , displaying the partial contributions , and in table ii , the effects are combined . for the strong hyperfine contributions , we see that the @xmath33 effect tends to reduce the contribution from the leading @xmath58 term by up to 20% in d - mesons and by up to 8% in b - mesons .",
    "the errors quoted for the individual terms are rather large which indicate a strong correlation .",
    "this is displayed in fig.(2 ) .",
    "the error due to the uncertainty in @xmath4 manifests itself in the individual strong hyperfine terms where it is approximately @xmath111mev in the d mesons .",
    "this indicates that , at present , the @xmath33 strong hyperfine effects can not be established with good precision . clearly , the combined hyperfine effects are very precise as shown in table ii .    the leading order contributions by the light quark masses , which are independent of the meson s spin , _",
    "i.e. _ the contributions proportional to @xmath59 , are well determined by the fit , the error being dominated by the errors in the input light quark mass ratios .",
    "the @xmath58 corrections proportional to @xmath60 can also be determined quite easily : because the spin dependent term @xmath112 turns out to be rather small , the @xmath60 term is almost entirely determined in terms of the combination @xmath113 . in particular , its sign is positive because @xmath114 .",
    "this is a puzzling fact : if one tries to interpret the @xmath60 term from the point of view of a non - relativistic constituent quark model , the dependence of @xmath115 on the light quark masses will be through the reduced mass of the @xmath116 system , and because the @xmath117 correction to the reduced mass is negative , the sign of the @xmath60 term should be opposite to that of the @xmath59 term .",
    "this is indication of a clear departure from the non - relativistic quark model picture which we have not seen addressed in the literature . to complete the light quark mass effects ,",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath112 provide the @xmath5 breaking effects to the strong hyperfine interaction , and are determined with an error of about 10% , which is remarkable . for instance , in the case of the @xmath76 mass difference , it gives an upward shift of @xmath118 mev .",
    "the combined effects of the light quark masses , displayed in table ii , show that they are determined by this analysis with an accuracy that is in general better than 10% .",
    "there is , however , one important and still unresolved problem concerning the light quark mass effects , and this has to do with the non - analytic contributions proportional to @xmath81 @xcite , which are expected to be large @xcite , according to the estimated value of the coupling @xmath119 @xcite that gives the amplitudes @xmath120 .",
    "a consistent analysis should include up to the @xmath121 effects , which is beyond the current analysis .",
    "this problem , therefore , introduces some uncertainty in the determination of the light quark mass effects that is difficult to estimate .    as mentioned earlier , we can separate the electromagnetic effects into self - energy and coulomb plus hyperfine type terms .",
    "the self - energy has only a spin independent piece and it represents an effect of less than 1 mev , and is determined with about 30% error .",
    "it has the same sign and comparable magnitude to results from calculations based on the cottingham formula for electromagnetic mass shifts in a vmd approximation @xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction is given by the term proportional to @xmath68 and its subleading piece proportional to @xmath69 , as explained earlier , has been absorbed into other terms .",
    "the fit determines the coulomb effect with an error of 11% .",
    "the electromagnetic hyperfine effects are associated with the two parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 . the input for",
    "@xmath124 does not differentiate between the neutral and charged mesons ; if it is identified with the neutral mesons , then one of these two parameters can be eliminated as a consequence of the relation eqn .",
    "( 12 ) . for this reason ,",
    "in the fits , we carried out identifying @xmath125 ; one finds a large correlation between these two parameters , which requires that we keep only one of them .",
    "we keep @xmath122 , which amounts to ignoring the @xmath17 dependence in @xmath123 , absorbing the rest of it into @xmath122 .",
    "our analysis is , therefore , insensitive to the qcd running of the electromagnetic hyperfine effects , which is not surprising .",
    "we have moreover checked that our results are almost insensitive to the interpretation of the input @xmath124 as an arbitrary combination of the charged and neutral mass differences .",
    "the hyperfine effects are significant in the d - mesons , for instance , in the @xmath72 case , it is about 60% of the coulomb effect . on the other hand , in the b - system , the hyperfine effects are much smaller than the experimental uncertainties in the mass differences .",
    "comparison , with the calculations in ref.@xcite , shows agreement with the results in the elastic approximation to the cottingham formula using vmd .",
    "note that the inelastic contributions in the cottingham formula that correspond to the interaction coulomb and hyperfine terms are suppressed by @xmath16 and , therefore , to the order we are working here , they can be neglected .",
    "it is instructive to make some comparisons .",
    "the electromagnetic shifts for the pseudoscalar mesons are @xmath126 mev , and @xmath127 mev , which are similar within errors to @xmath128 mev .",
    "this is however a bit of a coincidence , as it can be seen from the results obtained for the different contributions , which are in the coulomb and hyperfine cases very different in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "if we consider the vector mesons , we obtain @xmath129 mev , and @xmath130 mev , which we can compare with @xmath131 mev ( note that , as in the case of pions , the mass difference between charged and neutral @xmath36 meson is purely electromagnetic ) .",
    "one important observation is that the uncertainties in the ratios of light quark masses only have a noticeable effect in the self - energy terms , while the uncertainty in @xmath4 leaves the results for the electromagnetic effects virtually unchanged .",
    "the isospin mass splittings due to @xmath132 and @xmath133 are : @xmath134 mev , @xmath135 mev , @xmath136 mev , and @xmath137 mev .",
    "the difference between the last two is the negligible isospin breaking induced on the strong hyperfine interaction in the @xmath2 mesons .",
    "this effect is larger and significant in the @xmath0 mesons as shown by the difference between the first two mass differences .",
    "finally , one can give an accurate prediction : @xmath138 mev .",
    "the combination , @xmath139 mev , gives the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons of the @xmath58 spin independent part of the isospin breaking by the quark masses .",
    "the electromagnetic part of the same combination is substantially larger and equal to @xmath140 mev .",
    "a similar analysis is straightforward for the mass splittings due to @xmath141 .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the different contributions to the mass splittings in heavy ground state mesons .",
    "the analysis shows that , with the current empirical accuracy of the heavy meson masses , one can determine these contributions with significant precision even at the sub - leading order in @xmath16 .",
    "the results obtained here can be useful for constraining models of heavy mesons , and perhaps also for lattice qcd calculations of heavy mesons masses where it is possible to study the light quark mass dependence .",
