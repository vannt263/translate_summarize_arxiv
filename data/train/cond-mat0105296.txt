    "the model  @xcite is among the simplest systems to display self - organized criticality and avalanche behavior . starting from arbitrary initial conditions ,",
    "the model spontaneously reaches a state with long range correlations in space and time that are set up by a series of avalanche events .",
    "the approach to criticality , the critical state of the model , and the properties of avalanches in the model have been extensively studied during the past decade .",
    "there are now precise values of critical exponents and well - tested scaling laws . on the other hand ,",
    "there is not yet a theory of the critical state except for the case of mean field theory and near zero dimension .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the complexity of the histories generated by the model .",
    "these histories manifest long time correlations with early random events influencing distant , later events",
    ". however , the past may determine the future in ways which are more or less complex .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to give a precise meaning to the notion of a complex history and then to show that histories produced by the model are not complex in this sense .",
    "the framework in which we will define the complexity of a history is computational complexity theory .",
    "computational complexity theory measures the computational resources needed to solve problems . among those resources are _ parallel time _ or equivalently _ depth _ , which measures the number of steps needed by a massively parallel computer to solve a problem .",
    "if the solution to a problem can be re - organized so that many computations are carried out simultaneously and independently then a great deal of computational work can be accomplished in few parallel steps . on the other hand",
    ", it may be that the sequential nature of the problem precludes reorganizing the work into a small number of parallel steps .",
    "the theory of parallel computational complexity provides algorithms for efficiently solving some problems in parallel and provides evidence supporting the proposition that solutions to other tasks can not be substantially accelerated by parallelization .",
    "a powerful feature of this theory is that it yields essentially the same results independent of the choice of the model of computation .",
    "thus , measures of parallel computational complexity reveal the logical structure of the problem at hand rather than the limitations of the particular model of parallel computation .",
    "we will define the complexity of histories generated by a stochastic model such as the model in terms of the parallel time required to generate a sample history . if , through parallelization , the dynamics of the model can be reorganized so that many processors running for a few steps can generate a statistically valid history then we will say the histories generated by the model are not complex .",
    "if on the other hand , there is little benefit from parallelization so that a history must be generated in a step by step fashion , then the model generates complex histories .",
    "the model illustrates the point that scale invariant spatial and temporal correlations are not sufficient to guarantee complexity in the sense defined here .",
    "indeed , it is the strictly hierarchical nature of the avalanches in the model that permits us to generate them in a small number of highly parallel steps .",
    "the present work fits into a series of studies of the computational complexity of models in statistical physics .",
    "although previous studies focused mainly on the computational complexity of generating spatial patterns , in many cases the analysis can also be applied to reveal the complexity of the history of the growth of the pattern .",
    "for example , two dynamical processes for diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) have been shown to be p - complete  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that these processes for generating dla clusters can not be re - organized to greatly reduce the parallel time needed for the generation of an aggregate ( however , see [ ] for a parallel algorithm that achieves a modest speed - up for dla ) .",
    "the growth of an aggregate can be viewed as a history and the same arguments can be employed to give evidence that such histories can not be significantly parallelized .",
    "similarly , predicting the behavior of abelian sandpiles for @xmath0 has been shown to be p - complete @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the patterns generated by a number of growth models such as the eden model , invasion percolation and the restricted solid - on - solid model were shown to require little parallel time  @xcite and these results carry over immediately to fast parallel algorithms for generating histories for these models .      in sec .",

    "computational complexity theory determines the scaling of computational resources needed to solve problems as a function of the size of the problem .",
    "introductions to the field can be found in refs .",
    ". computational complexity theory may be set up in several nearly equivalent ways depending on the choice of model of computation .",
    "here we focus on parallel computation and choose the standard _ parallel random access machine _ ( pram ) as the model of computation .",
    "the main resources of interest are _ parallel time _ or _",
    "depth _ and number of processors .",
    "a pram consists of a number of simple processors ( random access machines or rams ) all connected to a global memory .",
    "although a ram is typically defined with much less computational power than a real microprocessor such as pentium , it would not change the scaling found here to think of a pram as being composed of many microprocessors all connected to the same random access memory .",
    "the processors run synchronously and each processor runs the same program .",
    "processors have an integer label so that different processors follow different computational paths .",
    "since all processor access the same memory , provision must be made for how to handle conflicts .",
    "here we choose the _ concurrent read , concurrent write _",
    "( crcw ) pram model in which many processors may attempt to write to or read from the same memory cell at the same time .",
    "if there are conflicts between what is to be written , the processor with the smallest label succeeds in writing .",
    "the pram is an idealized and fully scalable model of computation .",
    "the number of processors and memory is allowed to increase _ polynomially _",
    "( i.e.  as an arbitrary power ) in the size of the problem to be solved .",
    "communication is idealized in that it is assumed that any processor can communicate with any memory cell in a single time step .",
    "obviously , this assumption runs up against speed of light or hardware density limitations .",
    "nonetheless , parallel time on a pram quantifies a fundamental aspect of computation . during each parallel step",
    ", processor must carry out independent actions .",
    "communication between processor can only occur from one step to the next via reading and writing to memory .",
    "any problem that can be solved by a pram with @xmath1 processors in parallel time @xmath2 could also be solved by a single processor machine in a time that is no greater than @xmath3 since the single processor could sequentially run through the tasks that were originally assigned to the @xmath1 processors . on the other hand",
    ", it is not obvious whether the work of a single processor can be re - organized so that it can be accomplished in a substantially smaller number of steps by many processor working independently during each step .",
    "two examples will help illustrate this point .",
    "first , suppose the task is to add @xmath4 finite - precision numbers .",
    "this can be done by a single processor in a time that scales linearly in @xmath4 . on a pram with @xmath5 processor",
    "this can be done in @xmath6 parallel time using a binary tree ( for simplicity , suppose @xmath4 is a power of @xmath7 ) .",
    "in the first step , processor one adds the first and second numbers and puts the result in memory , processor two adds the third and fourth numbers and puts the result in memory and so on .",
    "after the first step is concluded there are @xmath5 numbers to add and these are again summed in a pairwise fashion by @xmath8 processors . the summation is completed after @xmath9 steps .",
    "this method is rather general and applies to any associative binary operation .",
    "problems of this type have efficient parallel algorithms and can be solved in time that is a power of the logarithm of the problem size , here @xmath4 , that is , _ polylog _ time .",
    "a second example is the problem of evaluating the output of a boolean circuit with definite inputs .",
    "a boolean circuit is composed of and , or and not gates connected by wires .",
    "suppose the gates are arranged in levels so that gates in one level take their inputs only from gates of the previous level and give their outputs only to gates of the next level so there is no feedback in the circuit .",
    "the number of levels in the circuit is referred to as the _ depth _ of the circuit . at the top level of the circuit are the true or false inputs . at the bottom level of the circuit are one or more outputs . given some concisely encoded description of the circuit and its inputs , the problem of obtaining the outputs is known as the _ circuit value problem _ ( cvp ) .",
    "clearly , we can solve cvp on a pram in parallel time that is proportional to the depth of the circuit since we can evaluate a single level of the circuit in a single parallel time step . on the other ,",
    "there is no known general way of speeding up the evaluation of a boolean circuit to a time that is , say polylog in the depth of the circuit . for the case of adding @xmath4 numbers , the logical structure of the problem is sufficiently simple that we can substitute hardware for time to obtain the answer in polylog parallel steps . for cvp",
    ", hardware can not be used to substantially decrease the depth of the problem .    at the present time , the statement that cvp can not be solved in polylog parallel time is not mathematically proved .",
    "instead , one can show that cvp is _",
    "p - complete_. to understand the meaning of p - completeness we must first introduce the complexity classes * p * and * nc * and the notion of _ reduction_. * p * consists of the class of problems that can be solved by a pram in polynomial time with polynomially many processors . *",
    "nc * consists of the class of problems that can be solved in polylog time on a pram with polynomially many processors .",
    "a problem @xmath10 is reduced to a problem @xmath11 if a pram with an oracle for @xmath11 can be used to solve @xmath12 in polylog time with polynomially many processors .",
    "an oracle for @xmath11 is able to supply the pram a solution to an instance of @xmath11 in a single time step .",
    "intuitively , if @xmath10 can be reduced to @xmath11 then @xmath10 is no harder to solve in parallel than @xmath11 .",
    "a problem in * p * is p - complete if all other problems in * p * can be reduced to it .",
    "it can be proved that cvp is p - complete . furthermore ,",
    "if it could be shown that there is any problem in * p * that is not in * nc * then it would follow that cvp is not in * nc * . however , the conjecture that @xmath13 , though widely believed , is not yet proved . since reductions",
    "are transitive , showing that another problem @xmath10 is p - complete can be proved by reducing cvp to @xmath10 . later in the paper",
    "we will take this approach to prove that two problems representing different dynamics are p - complete .",
    "in addition to supplying a p - complete problem , boolean circuits serve as an alternate model of computation . for a given computational problem , and for a given problem",
    ", there is a boolean circuit that solves the problem . in order to solve problems of any size",
    ", a family of boolean circuits is needed , one for each problem size .",
    "furthermore , to be comparable to a pram running a single program , the family of circuits should satisfy a _ uniformity _",
    "condition that bounds the complexity of the computation needed to specify each circuit in the family .",
    "the resources of circuit depth ( number of levels in the circuit ) and circuit width ( maximum number of gates in a level ) are roughly comparable to the pram resources of parallel time and number of processor , respectively .",
    "indeed the class * nc * can be defined as the set of problems that can be solved by uniform circuit families whose depth scales polylogarithmically in the problem size and whose width scales polynomially in the problem size .",
    "* p * is the class of problems solvable by circuits of polynomial width and depth .",

    "if the site is part of the backbone it is then given an explicit random number in the interval @xmath41 .",
    "the construction of an @xmath26-avalanche backbone begins with the renewal of the origin and its neighbors and then continues until there are no remaining sites with number less than @xmath26 .",

    "since @xmath78 is associative we can unroll eq.([eq : gap ] ) to obtain , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the initial value of the gap and the @xmath81 are identically distributed independent random variables chosen from the same distribution as @xmath77 described above . using a standard parallel minimum program ,",
    "each @xmath81 can be generated on a probabilistic pram in @xmath82 parallel time .",

    "we show how to generate an @xmath26-avalanche in parallel time that is polylog in @xmath85 .",
    "the idea of this algorithm is to generate in parallel a large number of independent small avalanches and then to paste groups of these together to create a smaller number of larger avalanches .",

    "these values specify the types of avalanches to be manufactured .",

    "the pattern for constructing @xmath105-avalanches from an @xmath94-avalanche should now be clear : @xmath94-avalanches are pasted together until all the covered sites have @xmath106 .    the process of pasting together @xmath94-avalanches is a generalized version of the standard process .",
    "indeed , pasting together @xmath100-avalanches is exactly the standard process .",
    "all that we need to know about each @xmath94-avalanche is its origin and the final values of @xmath20 on the sites the avalanche covers . during the construction of an @xmath105-avalanche ,",

    "if the covered sites all have @xmath107 , the @xmath95-avalanche is finished .",
    "the pasting together of @xmath94-avalanches must be carried out sequentially so that if the number of @xmath94-avalanches needed to construct a single @xmath105-avalanches is @xmath108 then it will take @xmath108 parallel steps to grow the avalanche .",
    "finally , once an @xmath26-avalanche is constructed , it is straightforward to find its backbone by eliminating those sites for which @xmath109 .    on average @xmath96 @xmath94-avalanches must be pasted together to form one @xmath105-avalanche , that is @xmath110 . however , the @xmath111 step in the parallel construction of an @xmath26-avalanche is not complete until _ all _ the required @xmath105-avalanches have been made .",
    "thus , the time required for this step will be set by the maximum value of @xmath108 . as @xmath26 approaches @xmath42 , and for fixed @xmath4 we need to make increasingly many @xmath105-avalanches so that the tail of the @xmath108 distribution is explored . as we shall see in the next section , the expected value of the maximum of @xmath108 increases logarithmically in the number of @xmath112-avalanches that are constructed . as a result , the average parallel time required to generate an @xmath26-avalanche is predicted to be proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "the discussion thus far has posited an effectively infinite environment for the avalanche to grow in , however this is not required .",
    "the same hierarchical construction can just as well be used to make avalanches in periodic boundary conditions in a system of size @xmath114 .",
    "additional complications arise for other boundary conditions due to the breaking of translational symmetry and this situation will not be discussed here .    finally , we are ready to describe how to construct a full history in a system with @xmath71 sites and periodic boundary conditions starting from the initial condition , @xmath115 .",

    "figure [ fig : or ] shows a and b read at time @xmath16 and @xmath300 however any time separation between the reading a and b is permitted , the only constraint on the or gate is that both a and b must be read before a@xmath318b is read .",

    "note that the non - local character of the gadgets allows non - planar monotone cvp to be reduced to the one - dimensional problem , in contrast to the situation for standard dynamics where the p - completeness holds only for @xmath196 .",
    "our main result is that histories can be efficiently generated in parallel .",
    "specifically , simulations and analytic arguments suggest that a history of length @xmath124 can be simulated on a pram with polynomially many processors in average parallel time @xmath319 with the actual asymptotic behavior close to @xmath320 .",

    "the construction of a single @xmath26-avalanche can be carried out in average parallel time @xmath321 which is exponentially less than the expected duration of the avalanche @xmath322 .",
    "how is it possible to create long range correlations in space and time very quickly in parallel ?",
    "first of all , it must be emphasized that the ground rules for parallel computation with a pram allow for non - local transmission of information in a single time step . to see how space - time correlations can be set up in a parallel time that is polylog in the correlation length or time , consider one step in the hierarchical construction of avalanches .",
    "for example , suppose two @xmath94-avalanches are concatenated to yield a single @xmath95-avalanche .",
    "the correlation length and time are thereby increased by constant factors in a fixed number of parallel steps .",
    "non - local transmission of information is needed to align the origin of the second @xmath94-avalanche with the final extremal site of the first @xmath94-avalanche and it is this alignment of the two @xmath94-avalanches that increases the correlation length and time .",
    "the result is that spatio - temporal correlations grow exponentially in the number of parallel steps .    in the parallel construction ,",
    "independent _ collection of @xmath94-avalanches are concatenated to form an @xmath95-avalanche .",
    "nonetheless , avalanches have a temporal structure and exhibit aging  @xcite .",
    "aging is consistent with the independence of subavalanches for the following reason .",
    "the last extremal value in the construction of an @xmath95-avalanche must exceed @xmath95 and this extremal value is more likely to come from the last @xmath94-avalanche used in the construction .",
    "thus , extremal values and other properties of avalanches display aging .",
    "another example where critical correlations are set up much faster in parallel than might be expected are cluster monte carlo algorithms  @xcite for critical spin systems .",
    "each cluster sweep can be accomplished in polylog parallel time on a pram with polynomially many processors using a parallel graph connectivity algorithm .",
    "the number of sweeps required to reach equilibrium scales as a small power ( typically much less than unity ) of the system size .",
    "thus long range critical correlations are set up in a parallel time that is much less than the correlation length .",
    "this is quite different than physically realistic local dynamics where critical correlations require a time that is at least quadratic in the correlation length .",
    "the intuition that histories are generated by an inherently sequentially process is not entirely wrong .",
    "in fact , standard dynamics was shown here to be associated with a p - complete decision problem for @xmath196 .",
    "standard dynamics takes as its inputs the initial values on the lattice and a sequence of @xmath323-tuples of numbers that are used to renew the extremal site and its neighbors at each time step .",
    "the p - completeness result implies that it is almost certainly not possible to parallelize standard dynamics so that the resulting history is generated in polylog time .",
    "the key problem that prevents full parallelization of standard dynamics is that all site values are explicitly defined at every step in the construction .",
    "in contrast , parallel dynamics does not assign explicit values except in the avalanche backbones until the end of the calculation . for the model ,",
    "predicting the future starting from explicit initial conditions is harder than sampling a typical history .",
    "conditional dynamics is a third method for generating histories that has the smallest set of space - time sites explicitly defined until the end of the calculation .",
    "nonetheless , conditional dynamics is also associated with a p - complete decision problem and so can not be efficiently parallelized .",
    "parallel dynamics shares features in common with both conditional and standard dynamics and is intermediate in the degree to which it avoids explicit specification of site values until the end of the computation .",
    "the results presented here reflect characteristics of the model that are independent of the pram model of computation in which they were presented .",
    "the primary result of the paper can equivalently be stated in terms of families of boolean circuits .",
    "specifically , we can envision a hard - wired device composed of logical gates and random bit generators .",
    "the gates are wired in a feedforward direction so that , in generating a history , each gate is used only once .",
    "when the circuit is activated it produces a statistically correct history . for each system size @xmath114 and time @xmath124",
    "we need a different circuit . because of the equivalence of prams and circuit families",
    ", our result can be stated in terms of the logical depth of the circuit .",
    "logical depth is the longest sequence of gates between any of the random bit generators and the output representing the history .",
    "the existence of an efficient parallel algorithm implies that there is a uniform family of the circuits for generating histories whose depth scales polylogarithmically in @xmath124 , independent of @xmath114 .",
    "the number of gates in the circuit is bounded by a power of @xmath324 .",
    "the actual running time for any real circuit generating histories would , of course , be polynomial and not polylogarithmic in @xmath124 because of the need for wires connecting distant gates required for establishing the long range spatio - temporal correlations .",
    "a variety of non - equilibrium models in statistical physics have been employed to study the spontaneous emergence of complexity . besides the model ,",
    "other examples include diffusion limited aggregation  @xcite ( dla ) , invasion percolation and sandpiles . besides their application to specific physical phenomena , these models have a broad appeal because they are governed by simple microscopic rules and yet they display self - organized criticality .",
    "it has been argued that they perhaps shed light on far more complex phenomena found , for example , in biology or economics .",
    "surely , however , biological and economic systems generate histories that have polynomial rather than polylogarithmic logical depth .",
    "perhaps one criterion for a model of the spontaneous emergence of complexity is that it should generate histories that require more than polylogarithmic depth to simulate .",
    "neither the model nor invasion percolation  @xcite satisfy this requirement . on the other hand , both diffusion limited aggregation and the bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) sandpile model  @xcite are related to p - complete problems  @xcite which strongly suggests that the clusters or avalanches associated with these models can not be simulated in polylog depth .",
    "however , neither model generates histories much deeper than a power of the system size . in the case of dla",
    ", the cluster size can not exceed the system size so that the length of the history is bounded by @xmath325 where @xmath326 is the fractal dimension of the cluster .",
    "sandpile models are well - defined for arbitrarily long times .",
    "however , the btw model has an abelian property , which allows avalanches to be combined in any order .",
    "thus , it is possible to rearrange long histories so they are generated in polylog parallel time . from a given initial condition",
    ", it requires @xmath327 steps to relax the system  @xcite .",
    "a sequence of avalanches due to randomly dropping sand on single sites can be organized into a binary tree using the same idea as adding numbers in parallel .",
    "the result is that a history of length @xmath328 can be simulated in parallel in time @xmath329 .",
    "by contrast , we find that histories can be simulated in parallel time @xmath319 independent of system size .",
