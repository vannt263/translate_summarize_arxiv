    "spinor quantum gas has received tremendous attention ever since the first creation of a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate in an optical trap @xcite .",
    "most of these studies deal with spinor bose gases .",
    "the most salient feature of spinor condensates is the presence of spin - exchange interaction which drives coheret spin - mixing dynamics .",
    "a natural question can be asked is : can similar behavior be observed in a quantum degenerate fermionic system ?",
    "the current work is an attempt to address this question .",
    "quantum degenerate fermi gases have been realized in many laboratories @xcite .",
    "different with the normal electronic system , many fermionic atoms have spins higher than 1/2 in their lowest hyperfine manifold .",
    "these large - spin ultracold fermi gases provide us a unique opportunity to investigate exotic many - body physics @xcite , and have stimulated a great deal of theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "considerable experimental progress has also been made recently in the system of @xmath0sr ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is total hyperfine spin ) @xcite and @xmath3yb ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "both @xmath0sr and @xmath3yb have an alkaline - earth - like atomic structure with all electron shells filled , thus their hyperfine spins completely come from nuclear spins .",
    "this will lead to a spin - independent atom - atom interaction since the nuclear spins are deep within the atom . in these alkaline - earth - like fermionic system",
    ", the spin - independent interaction can give rise to the so - called @xmath5 symmetry , with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , for a more general cold fermi system including non - alkaline - earth atoms with large spins , the @xmath5 symmetry may not be reserved . as a result",
    ", one can find a more rich phases diagram in its ground state @xcite . in a seminal work published very recently @xcite , a spinor fermi gas of @xmath7k",
    "was realized . by taking advantage of the spin conservation ,",
    "the effective spin of the system can be tuned from 1/2 to 9/2 .    in this article , we focus on the simplest large - hyperfine - spin systems with @xmath8 with four internal components .",
    "this can be either true hyperfine spin ( e.g. , @xmath9cs , @xmath10be and @xmath11hg ) or effetive spin such as realized in ref .",
    "if we consider atoms with nonzero electron spins due to partially filled electron shells , then the interaction among atoms will be spin - dependent .",
    "one of the key features in this kind of systems is that there will be spin - exchange interactions which constantly mix different spin components .",
    "for example , two atoms with respective hyperfine spins @xmath12 and @xmath13 interact and become two atoms with hyperfine spins @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as schemcatically depicted in fig .  [ mix ] .",
    "a similar case of spin mixing has been well studied for spinor condensates @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the model hamiltonian in sec .",
    "the ground state properties and the spin - mixing dynamics are discussed in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "to begin we consider a homogeneous dilute gas of fermionic atoms with hyperfine spin @xmath8 in a box with volume @xmath16 .",
    "the second quantized hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 @xmath19 is the atomic field annihilation operator associated with atoms in the hyperfine spin state @xmath20 .",
    "the summation indices in ( [ ham1 ] ) run through the values @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the bare atomic energy for spin state @xmath23 .",
    "we will consider an effective quadratic zeeman shift such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the linear zeeman shift can be gauged away .",
    "if we consider the @xmath26-wave scattering only , then the interaction between atoms can be characterized by the coefficients @xmath27 which are obtained from the two - body interaction model @xmath28 . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the projection operator which projects the pair into a total hyperfine spin @xmath30 state , @xmath31 is the interaction strength in the total spin @xmath30 channel , which , in the calculation , will be replaced in favor of the @xmath26-wave scattering length @xmath32 via the regularization procedure : @xmath33 for fermi gases , there is no @xmath26-wave interaction in the odd total spin ( @xmath34 , 3 ) channels , since these channels are forbidden by pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "we expand the field operators with plane wave function @xmath35 and complete the spatial integral to the hamiltonian into momentum space :    @xmath36\\ , , \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for notational simplicity ,",
    "we have used @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 to denote the annihilation operators for the component with spin quantum number @xmath44 and @xmath14 , respectively . from the hamiltonian above , we can see clearly that the terms with coefficients @xmath45 describe spin - mixing processes such as that depicted in fig .",
    "thus spin mixing requires @xmath46 or @xmath47 . in the case",
    "@xmath48 , spin mixing does not exist and the population in each spin component is individually conserved . under such a condition ,",
    "the interaction obeys @xmath49 symmetry @xcite .    as",
    "our focus is on the effect of spin - mixing interaction , we will consider the case with @xmath47 . great simplification can be further achieved by assuming @xmath50 and @xmath51 , in which case the second line of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) vanishes .",
    "this is the case we will consider in this work .",
    "we note that the essential physics does not change qualitatively if @xmath52 .",
    "throughout this work , we take temperature to be zero .",
    "we will first consider the mean - field ground state property of the system . in the case of @xmath50 , it is obvious from hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) that superfluid pairing can occur between spin components @xmath53 and @xmath54 . if we denote @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the hamiltonian under the mean - field approximation can be written as @xmath57\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "to diagonalize this hamiltonian , we can perform the bogoliubov transformation @xmath60 here , the new coefficients should meet the following conditions to ensure the anticommutativity of new operators .",
    "@xmath61 then we can write down the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations as @xmath62 @xmath63 where we have introduced the chemical potential @xmath64 into the equations .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath65 particles in total , and the population in opposite spin states are equal , i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ". then we have @xmath68 and the order parameter is given by @xmath69    without loss of generality , we take the effective quadratic zeeman shift as @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for a given @xmath72 and the @xmath26-wave scattering length @xmath73 , we solve the bdg equations self - consistently , and typical results",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ nk ] .",
    "the upper panels of fig .  [ nk ] display the momentum distribution in different spin components at various values of @xmath72 .",
    "as @xmath72 increases , the population in the spin components @xmath74 decreases , and that in @xmath75 increases . this can be easily understood from the energetic point of view .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , for large @xmath72 , the momentum distribution in @xmath75 components approaches a step function , exemplifying a normal fermi sea .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ nk](c ) shows that the magnitude of the order parameter decreases as @xmath72 increases .",
    "intuitively , one might have thought that for very large @xmath72 , the population in the @xmath74 components becomes negligible and the system reduces into a two - component spin-1/2 fermi gas , which should exhibits a superfluid ground state at zero temperature .",
    "results presented in fig .",
    "[ nk ] apparently contradicts this intuitive picture .     and",
    "@xmath76 for quadratic zeeman shift @xmath77 ( solid blue ) , @xmath78 ( dot - dashed orange ) and @xmath79 ( dashed red ) , in units of the fermi energy @xmath80 . in the calculation we set @xmath81 for ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , and @xmath82 for ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) , where the dimensionless interaction strength is defined as @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the fermi wavenumber .",
    "( c ) order parameter @xmath85 as a function of @xmath72.,width=336 ]    to gain some insights into this problem , let us consider the so - called cooper problem where two extra particles with attractive interaction lie on the surface of a filled fermi sea noninteracting atoms .",
    "the eigenvalue equations describing the two interacting particles in @xmath86-space are given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are pairing amplitudes between @xmath92 , @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the presence of the fermi sea imposes the restriction that @xmath86 and @xmath93 lie outside of the fermi sea , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "a negative value of the eigenenergy @xmath95 means that the two particles form a bound pairing with binding energy @xmath96 .",
    "the larger @xmath96 is , the more strongly the pair binds .     for dimensionless interaction strength ( defined in fig .",
    "[ nk ] ) @xmath81 ( solid blue ) and @xmath82 ( dashed red ) , respectively .",
    ", width=259 ]    after some mathematical manipulation , the two eigenvalue equations ( [ eigenvalue ] ) leads to the following single equation for @xmath95 : @xmath97 which can be solved numerically .",
    "the solution of @xmath95 as a function of @xmath72 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ cooper ] , from which one can see that , as @xmath72 increases , @xmath96 tends to zero . in other words ,",
    "the pairs becomes less and less bound .",
    "this result is consistent with the many - body result illustrated in fig .",
    "we therefore reach the conclusion that the energy mismatch induced by the quadratic zeeman shift @xmath72 , together with the spin - exchange interaction , tends to break the pair apart .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of the effect by a magnetic impurity on a spin-1/2 superconductor @xcite . in this latter system",
    ", the magnetic impurity induces an energy difference between the two pairing particles and has the tendency of destroying the pairing .",
    "so far we have focused on the ground state of the system .",
    "now , let us turn to the spin - mixing dynamics . before dealing with the many - body situation",
    ", it may be helpful to investigate the cooper problem first .",
    "we take the initial state to be the ground state of the cooper system under an effective quadratic zeeman field with @xmath98 . at @xmath99",
    ", we suddenly turn this field off so that @xmath77 and the system starts to evolve .",
    "the dynamics of system is governed by eq .",
    "( [ eigenvalue ] ) after replacing @xmath95 on the left hand side with @xmath100 .",
    "the equations can be simplified if we redefine two quantities as follows : @xmath101 \\,,\\ ] ] and the dynamical equations for @xmath77 can be rewritten as @xmath102 hence the two equations for @xmath103 are decoupled and the interaction term only appears in the equation for @xmath104 .",
    "the above equations can be easily solved and results are presented in fig .",
    "[ cd ] . initially , due to the presence of the large quadratic zeeman shift ,",
    "almost all the populations are in spin states @xmath75 .",
    "spin mixing dynamics is initiated by quenching this zeeman shift at @xmath99 .",
    "we compare the cases for two different values of the interaction strength : a weak interaction with @xmath81 and a strong interaction with @xmath82 . in both scenarios , damping is observed in spin mixing , and stronger interaction gives rise to a much faster damping .",
    "this can be intuitively understood as follows : the initial state can be regarded as a superposition of different eigenstates of the quenched hamiltonian .",
    "the stronger the interaction , the larger the number of the eigenstates contained in the initial state . for @xmath105 ,",
    "different eigenstates oscillate at different frequencies which results in the damping of the population dynamics .",
    "the more eigenstates are involved , the faster the damping .",
    "therefore , such damping is a result of the intrinsic multi - mode nature of the fermi gas . for a system of spinor condensate near zero temperature , as all the atoms occupy the same lowest - energy orbitals , nearly undamped spin - mixing oscillations can be observed @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath74 as functions of time ( in units of @xmath106 ) at two different interaction strengths . ]",
    "we now turn our attention to the dynamics in the many - body setting . as in the cooper problem",
    ", we prepare the system in the ground state with @xmath98 and at @xmath99 quench the quadratic zeeman field to zero .",
    "the ensuing mean - field dynamics can be simulated by solving the time - dependent bdg equations , obtained by replacing the eigenenergies at the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ bdg ] ) with @xmath107 @xcite . at each time step",
    ", the order parameter will be updated as @xmath108    representative results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mixmany ] .",
    "the dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar properties as in the cooper problem : damping is observed in both the dyanmics of the population and that of the order parameter , and the stronger the interaction , the faster the damping .",
    "this can be understood using a similar intuitive argument we presented for the cooper problem .",
    "we note that such damping was observed in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "finally we remark that the ground state corresponding to @xmath77 should have equal population in all four spin states and an order parameter value indicated by the horizontal line in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ mixmany ] . in the absence of any dissipation , as in our simulation ,",
    "the system remains far away from the ground state .",
    "( lower panels ) , in units of @xmath80 , for two different interaction strengths .",
    "the horizontal lines in the lower panels represent the value of @xmath85 in the ground state with @xmath77 .",
    "time is in units of @xmath109 . ]",
    "to conclude , we have examined the spin mixing interaction of a degenerate fermi gas with four internal spin components .",
    "it is quite remarkable that in the presence of an effective quadratic zeeman field that shifts relatively the bare energies of spin-(@xmath110 ) and spin-(@xmath76 ) states , the system becomes almost normal .",
    "this is analogous to the effect of the zeeman field that breaks the symmetry of the two spin components in a two - component ( spin-1/2 ) fermi gas .",
    "we have also investigated the spin - mixing dynamics initiated by quenching the quadratic zeeman field and show that , unlike in the case of a spinor condensate , damping will necessarily occur in a many - body fermi gas due to the intrinsic multi - mode nature of fermions .",
