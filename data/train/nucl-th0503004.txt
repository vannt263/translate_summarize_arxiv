    "the state of matter at extremely hot or dense conditions is one of the most fundamental questions in physics .",

    "they showed that the ratios of the in - medium masses of the nucleon , @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-mesons to their masses in free space are approximately equal to each other at around the nuclear saturation density .",
    "afterwards , changes in the hadron masses in medium were calculated in the framework of qcd - sum rule @xcite and quark - meson - coupling ( qmc ) models @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , masses of @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons were calculated at the nuclear saturation density , and similar amount of mass reduction from the free mass , @xmath3 was predicted .",
    "experimentally , microscopic properties of hadrons as well as the states of matter at hot or dense environment can be probed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , and possible meson mass reductions in nuclear matter were reported through the dileptonic decay of @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons in the ceres / na45 @xcite and kek - ps e325 @xcite experiments . also , recent astronomical observations of binary systems yield the mass of compact objects as @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , of which the former is believed to be a neutron star .",

    "the eos s from the qhd , mqmc and mqmc - mb models whose @xmath10 s are close to each other ( 310.8 , 285.5 and 324.1 mev , respectively ) show similar behaviors at the energy densities considered here .",
    "the eos from the scaling models ( qhd - s and mqmc - s ) turns out to be stiffer than the eos from other models .",
    "this behavior can be understood by observing that the repulsion from the @xmath58meson is augmented at high densities ( see eq .",

    "[ fig : mene ] ) , @xmath66 is non - negligible compared to @xmath67 in the density region considered here . since @xmath0-meson contributes to the pressure negatively , @xmath66 reduces the total pressure substantially , which in turn leads to a sizable softening of the eos . on",
    "the other hand , @xmath67 from qhd - s is about 3 times larger than that of qhd , but @xmath66 from qhd - s is more or less similar to that from the qhd .",
    "thus the softening of the eos due to @xmath66 in qhd - s is relatively weak as the density becomes high , and consequently the eos from qhd - s is stiffer than that from qhd .",
    "here , we need to remark that in fig . [",
    "fig : eos ] the eos curves for mqmc - s and mqmc - mb terminate at a certain @xmath51 .",
    "it is due to a breakdown of the scc at a certain density . in appendix",

    "the composition of the neutron star matter is represented by the number of particles divided by the total baryon number .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : composition ] .",
    "+    the compositions from the qhd and mqmc models are very similar to each other , but the number of the protons for the qhd - s or mqmc - s model is larger than that for the qhd or the mqmc , respectively . the ratio of the proton number to the neutron number , @xmath74 is especially important in determining the cooling mechanism of the neutron star . two major mechanisms of the cooling are emission of the neutrinos from the interior and radiation of the photons near the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the simplest neutrino emission mechanism is the so - called direct urca ( du ) process , which is nothing but the @xmath68-decay as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : durca ] ) , and it is known as the most efficient neutrino - emitting process in the interior of the neutron star . in order for this process to occur , however , the ratio @xmath74 should be larger than a critical value .",
    "the proton numbers from qhd - s and mqmc - s models increase faster than those from the qhd and mqmc models as the density increases .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 from qhd - s or mqmc - s can reach the critical value at lower densities and the @xmath68-decay can take place over a wider region in the interior of the neutron star than the qhd or mqmc models predict , causing a rapid cooling of the neutron star .",
    "however , a recent work on the cooling of the neutron star @xcite indicates that too low a threshold density for the du process can result in an unrealistic cooling scenario .",
    "du process can happen when both energy and momentum conservation is satisfied in eq .",
    "( [ eq : durca ] ) . since neutrinos have energy of the thermal fluctuation around the fermi momentum of the nucleon or electron , its momentum can be neglected .",
    "then the momentum conservation condition for du can be written as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 being the fermi momentum of particle  @xmath77 \" .",
    "the threshold density @xmath78 at which du starts to emit neutrinos is about @xmath79 for qhd and mqmc , and is about @xmath80 for qhd - s and mqmc - s .",
    "these threshold densities are too low to explain the observation of the neutron star temperature @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the density dependent meson masses and coupling constants are considered within the framework of relativistic mean field theory .",
    "it is shown that they obtained lower value of @xmath78 than that of our qhd model .",
    "therefore the nuclear models we have considered in this work may need further refinement and adjustment of parameters to produce threshold densities high enough for the cooling process to be reasonable .",
    "the mass and the radius of the neutron star can be obtained by integrating oppenheimer - volkov equation with a given eos . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutronstar ] the neutron star mass with our eos is plotted as a function of the central density @xmath81 ( left panel ) and of the radius ( right panel ) in units of solar mass @xmath82 .",
    "the solid line is the result from the qhd - s , the dashed line from the qhd , and the dotted line from the mqmc .",
    "qhd and mqmc give us very similar maximum mass @xmath83 with @xmath84 km and @xmath85 . on the contrary , due to the stiff eos",
    "the qhd - s gives us the maximum mass of about 2.9@xmath82 with the radius @xmath86 km and the central density @xmath87 .",
    "we could not extract the maximum mass of the neutron star for mqmc - s and mqmc - mb models since , as noted in the previous section , these models encounter a problem in solving the scc at a density before reaching the maximum mass .",
    "recent observations of the neutron star mass from the radio pulsars give us the mass range of the neutron stars as @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the maximum mass of the qhd - s is much larger than the upper limit of the observed values , so one may want to exclude the qhd - s among the models for the neutron stars .",
    "we may note , however , that more considerations are needed as follows .",
    "first , the qhd - s produces the saturation properties successfully .",
    "secondly , we have considered only the nucleon degrees in this work , but other degrees of freedom can come in such as hyperons or the phases like meson condensation and quark matter . in general , when these exotic degrees of freedom appear , they reduce the fermi momentum of nucleons through the @xmath68-decay of the nucleons to exotic states .",
    "this results in a smaller contribution of @xmath89 to the pressure , and thus the eos becomes softer with exotic degrees of freedom than otherwise .",
    "then the maximum mass of the neutron star becomes smaller .",
    "we have confirmed this behaviour by doing some more calculations including hyperons in the qhd and mqmc .",
    "the maximum mass of @xmath90 is obtained for qhd , and @xmath91 for mqmc .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate how these maximum masses will change when medium effects on meson masses and coupling constants are taken into consideration .",
    "it is noted , however , that the inclusion of hyperons can give us too low a mass limit of the neutron star @xcite , which is incompatible with the observations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a phase transition to quark matter is considered , and the maximum mass of the neutron star is obtained to lie in the range @xmath92 . a transition to quark matter is one possibility , and at the same time transitions to other exotica are also possible .",
    "these possibilities should be considered for a better understanding .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the properties of the neutron star matter by including the effects of meson mass changes in medium .",
    "we have explored various models at the hadron ( qhd and qhd - s ) and at the quark ( mqmc , mqmc - s and mqmc - mb ) levels .",
    "we have incorporated in - medium meson masses in two ways : one by assuming a simple function of scaling in both qhd and mqmc models , and the other by treating heavy mesons as mit bags within the framework of mqmc model .",
    "the eos and the particle fractions for the neutron star matter are calculated .",
    "scaling models show appreciable difference from the models with constant meson mass or meson bag models .",
    "the eos s from the scaling models are stiffer than those from other models .",
    "the scaling models show higher fractions of the protons than other models .",
    "stiff eos s from the scaling models lead to heavy and large neutron stars whose maximum mass is about 2.9@xmath82 which is larger than the observed values and the values predicted by other models by one solar mass .",
    "we may , however , note that the present work is just a first step toward the understanding of the relationship between the in - medium properties of physical quantities ( mass , coupling constant and etc . ) and the neutron star , and further studies need to be done .",
    "this work is supported by korea research foundation grant ( krf-2002 - 042-c00014 ) .",
    "in this section , we show a breakdown mechanism that occurs in solving the scc of the qmc model . since the scc for mqmc - s and mqmc - mb are involved , we employ the qmc model for the purpose of a simple illustration .",
    "the scc of the qmc model can be obtained by putting @xmath93 in eq .",
