    "the formation of galaxies is one of the most important research areas in cosmology . within the simplified hierarchical scenario of a universe governed by a cosmological constant and cold dark matter , the density profiles of forming halos",

    "numerical calculations show that the first generation of galaxies formed at very high redshifts inside collapsing halos ( starting at @xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this measurement suggests that reionization began at very high redshifts , @xmath5 .",
    "this means that a high enough abundance of luminous objects must have existed at that time , since these first luminous objects are expected to have heated and reionized their surroundings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the formation of a luminous object inside a halo requires , of course , gas to be inside the halo . even in halos that are too small for cooling via atomic hydrogen , i.e. ,",
    "minihalos , the gas content can have substantial , and observable , astrophysical effects .",
    "in addition to the posibility of hosting astrophysical sources , minihalos may produce a 21-cm signature ( @xcite but see @xcite ) , and they can block ionizing radiation and produce an overall delay in the global progress of reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the evolution of the halo gas fraction at various epochs of the universe is of prime importance , particularly in the early universe .",

    "when investigating this issue with simulations , a large volume is needed for an adequate statistical sample of halos , but on the other hand it is critical to maintain the proper resolution .",
    "the results of @xcite showed that in order to determine the mass and merger history of each halo even crudely in simulations , each halo must be resolved into 500 particles . in the high redshift regime , where halos are small and rare",
    ", these resolution requirements are not easy to achieve .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to do so in order to understand the formation of the first objects .",
    "consider the various scales involved in the formation of non - linear objects containing dm and gas . on large scales ( small wavenumbers )",
    "gravity dominates halo formation and gas pressure can be neglected . on small scales , on the other hand",
    ", the pressure dominates gravity and prevents baryon density fluctuations from growing together with the dark matter fluctuations .",
    "the relative force balance at a given time can be characterized by the @xcite scale , which is the minimum scale on which a small gas perturbation will grow due to gravity overcoming the pressure gradient . as long as the compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on the residual free electrons after cosmic recombination kept",
    "the gas temperature coupled to that of the cmb , the jeans mass was constant in time . however , at @xmath6 the gas temperature decoupled from the cmb temperature and the jeans scale began to decrease with time as the gas cooled adiabatically .",
    "any overdensity on a scale more massive than the jeans mass at a given time can begin to collapse , due to a lack of sufficient pressure .",
    "however , the jeans mass is related only to the evolution of perturbations at a given time .",
    "when the jeans mass itself varies with time , the overall suppression of the growth of perturbations depends on a time - averaged jeans mass .",
    "@xcite defined a `` filtering mass '' that describes the highest mass scale on which the baryonic pressure still manages to suppress the linear baryonic fluctuations significantly .",
    "@xcite suggested , based on a simulation , that the filtering mass also describes the largest halo mass whose gas content is significantly suppressed compared to the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "the latter mass scale , in general termed the `` characteristic mass '' , is defined as the halo mass for which the enclosed baryon fraction equals half the mean cosmic fraction .",
    "thus , the characteristic mass distinguishes between gas - rich and gas - poor halos .",
    "many semi - analytical models of dwarfs galaxies often use the characteristic mass scale in order to estimate the gas fraction in halos @xcite.recently , @xcite and @xcite showed that the characteristic mass scale does not agree with the @xcite filtering mass in the low - redshift , post - reionization regime .    in this paper",
    "we explore the very high - redshift regime using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations based on @xcite .",
    "they investigated the effects of a photo - ionizing ultraviolet ( uv ) flux on the collapse and cooling of small halos in relic hii regions at high redshift , by varying the strength and duration of a transient uv and persistent lyman - werner ( lw ) background .",
    "we consider two different scenarios presented there ( see section  [ sec : sims ] for a description of the simulations ) .",
    "we perform a resolution study and place a lower limit on the number of particles needed in a simulated halo in order to accurately determine the gas fraction in halos ( section  [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "we also compare the numerical evolution of the filtering mass as given by the linear calculation in @xcite to the simulation results ( section  [ sec : linear ] ) .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section  [ sec : con ] .",

    ", this is simply a good test case of a time - variable jeans mass at high redshift .",
    "our simulation runs at four different resolutions ( table  [ table ] ) allow us to carefully test the dependence of the gas fraction estimates on the resolution .",

    "this demonstrates numerical convergence and suggests that if we take our highest - resolution run at each halo mass , then we obtain the correct value of the mean halo gas fraction .     as a function of the halo mass @xmath33 in the simulations .",

    "underestimation of the gas fraction in halos can give incorrect results .",
    "the vlres run was used by @xcite and at the time was considered a very high resolution run in the high - redshift regime .",
    "we find , however , that our high resolution runs ( i.e. , hres and vhres ) estimate the gas fraction in the nouv case to be higher than for the vlres run by a factor of @xmath35 for a halo mass of @xmath36 .",
    "note , that @xcite focus on whether the gas has cooled relative to other runs at the same resolution , not the exact amount of gas inside each halo .",
    "furthermore , that study focused on halos whose gas was capable of cooling via the molecular hydrogen channel , corresponding to masses greater than @xmath37 at these redshifts , where the gas fraction is beginning to converge to the higher - resolution values",
    ". we can further quantify the resolution dependence of the halo gas fraction . at each halo mass , we adopt the gas fraction as given by our highest - resolution simulation available at that mass scale ( @xmath38 ) to be the correct value , and compare to this the result from all lower - resolution simulations that have halos of that same mass at the same redshift . we plot in figure  [ fig : all_fg ] these ratios , @xmath39 , where each simulation at each output redshift is compared to the highest - resolution run at the same halo mass and redshift . in order to test the idea that the resolution effect depends primarily on the halo mass resolution , these ratios are shown as a function not of the halo mass but of the number of particles in each halo ( @xmath40 ) in the lower - resolution run .",
    "note that for this we divided our various runs into the same mass bins .",
    "now , if the halo gas fraction did not depend on resolution then we would simply get unity .",

    "we find that , given our systematic errors , the filtering mass from linear theory is consistent with the characteristic mass fitted from the simulations for both the nouv and the flash cases ) is successful in giving a reduced @xmath139 of order unity in all cases except one ( see table  [ table2 ] ) . ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in this statement we are referring to our definition in equation  ( [ mf ] ) , which is one eighth of the original definition which @xcite claimed was a good fit to the characteristic mass . in any case , we conclude that at least in a particular redshift range ( @xmath140 ) the filtering mass provides a fairly good estimate to the characteristic mass , either before stellar heating or in its initial stages . since we have not probed a larger range of redshifts , we can not generalize this conclusion . also , the large systematic errors ( particularly in the flash case ) reduce the significance of the above conclusion .",
    "in figure  [ fig : mc ] we also show the filtering mass from the full calculation of @xcite assuming the correct initial conditions ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the nouv case .",
    "the correct initial conditions can not be fully directly incorporated in a simulation without starting at much higher redshifts than simulators are used to . in particular , these initial conditions include the fact that at @xmath141 the baryons are still essentially uniform ( on scales relevant for galactic halos ) due to their just ended strong coupling to the cmb photons . based on the agreement we have found between the linear theory and the simulations for the case of the simulations initial conditions , we suggest that we can estimate the real characteristic mass in the universe based on our analytical filtering mass calculation with the true initial conditions .",
    "there are several differences between our simulations initial conditions and the true ones .",
    "the initial conditions in the simulations assumed a lower temperature ( by @xmath142 at @xmath143 ) than the exact calculation with compton heating , resulting in lower gas pressure and thus a lower filtering mass than in the full analytical calculation .",
    "the assumption that the baryon perturbations follow the dark matter at @xmath13 creates tendencies to both raise the filtering mass ( since the baryon fraction , and thus the gas pressure , is too high within perturbations ) and lower it ( since the filtering mass reflectes the integrated effect of pressure , and the integral is only begun at @xmath13 instead of at @xmath141 ) .",
    "also , we note that the best - known cosmological parameters are slightly different from those in our simulation , i.e. , in our analytical calculation we use those of @xcite : ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , n , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) = ( 0.701 , 0.299 , 0.0478 , 0.957 , 0.82 , 68.7 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "however , changing the cosmological parameters does not play an important role .",
    "this is because the definition of the filtering mass is independent of @xmath10 which is the major difference in the cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , we conclude that the true minimum mass needed for a halo to keep at least half of its baryons , in the era before stellar heating ( i.e. , corresponding to the nouv case ) , is about @xmath144  m@xmath1 at @xmath145 .",
    "finally , we can also use our simulations to look beyond the tight @xmath146 relation of equation  ( [ f_g - alpha ] ) , and consider the distribution of gas fractions for a given halo mass .",
    "@xcite showed that this distribution in the simulation is well approximated as a lognormal distribution . performing the same analysis for the nouv scenario ,",
    "we find the same , as shown in figure  [ fig : pdf ] .",
    "since we have a limited number of halos , we collect all of our data at each redshift and consider the ratio between the measured @xmath68 and that predicted by equation  ( [ f_g - alpha ] ) with the best - fit parameters .",
    "thus , we assume that this relative distribution does not vary strongly with halo mass . since it is easier to deal with a normal distribution , we plot the distribution of @xmath147 and fit to it a normal distribution with mean @xmath148 and standard deviation @xmath85 .",
    "we show the best - fit parameter values with their 1-@xmath85 confidence ranges in table  [ table3 ] .    ) .",

    "we note that this agreement between the simulations and the linear theory in the nouv and the flash scenarios occurred in a regime where the heating is simple and easily incorporated within linear theory . in more complicated situations with inhomogeneous heating from astrophysical sources",

    "note that these authors used the @xcite definition for the filtering mass , which is eight times our definition .",
