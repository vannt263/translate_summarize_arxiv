    "it is an honor to be able to contribute to this volume memorializing jan van paradijs .",
    "jan made important scientific contributions to many areas of astrophysics , but especially to our understanding of thermonuclear x - ray bursts and the properties of low - mass x - ray binary systems ( lmxbs ) .",
    "it is therefore particularly fitting to include a few words about jan s scientific contributions in this review , which is concerned with x - ray oscillations in lmxbs .",
    "jan was one of the first to recognize that careful study of x - ray bursts could provide quantitative information about the properties of neutron star matter and strong gravitational fields .",
    "he realized that the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) would make possible much more sensitive and detailed studies of these questions .",
    "jan led a collaboration that anticipated the detection of periodic brightness oscillations during thermonuclear x - ray bursts and 1060  hz qpos in the atoll sources . even before _",
    "rxte _ was launched , he and his collaborators requested and were awarded observing time to search for these two phenomena . both were discovered soon after _ rxte _",
    "was launched and are among the most important discoveries made with it .",
    "jan s team was somewhat unlucky in not catching any bursts with detectable oscillations early in the mission , but they discovered kilohertz qpos in many neutron star x - ray sources . as i describe below , these and other discoveries made with _",
    "rxte _ have opened a new era in the study of dense matter and strong gravitational fields .",
    "i continue to miss jan as a friend as well as a scientific colleague .",
    "neutron stars and black holes are important cosmic laboratories for studying fundamental questions in physics and astronomy , especially the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields .",
    "the discovery using _ rxte _ of oscillations in the x - ray emission of accreting neutron stars and black holes with frequencies comparable to the dynamical frequencies near these objects has provided important new tools for studying these questions .",
    "the neutron stars in lmxbs have proved to be particularly valuable systems for investigating the innermost parts of accretion disks , gas dynamics and radiation transport in strong radiation and gravitational fields , and the properties of dense matter , because the magnetic fields of many of these stars are relatively weak ( @xmath110@xmath2@xmath3  g ) but not negligible .",
    "magnetic fields of this size are weak enough to allow at least a fraction of the accreting gas to remain in orbit as it moves into the strong gravitational and radiation fields of these stars , but strong enough to produce anisotropic x - ray emission , potentially allowing the spin rates of these stars to be determined .",
    "the `` clockwork '' of these systems is remarkably regular and systematic .",
    "observations using _ rxte _ are providing a wealth of diagnostic information about strong gravitational fields and the magnetic fields , spin rates , masses , and radii of these stars ( for previous reviews , see lamb , miller , & psaltis 1998a , 1998b ; van der klis 1998 , 2000 ; psaltis 2000 ) .",
    "qpos have also been discovered in the x - ray emission of accreting black holes in lmxbs .",
    "study of this variability is providing increasingly detailed information about these objects . the recent discovery that and both have two high - frequency qpos ( remillard et al .",
    "2001 ; strohmayer 2001c , 2001d ) is the first evidence that high - frequency qpos also occur in pairs in black hole systems and the strongest evidence to date that the black hole has significant angular momentum .",
    "the discovery with _ rxte _ of x - ray variability on dynamical time scales in black holes and neutron stars has revolutionized the study of accretion and x - ray emission by these objects . before the launch of _ rxte _",
    ", newtonian models were often used ; after the discovery of very high frequency oscillations with _ rxte _",
    ", strong - field general relativistic calculations have become the norm , to allow quantitative comparisons of models with the _ rxte _ data .",
    "the highest - frequency qpos are thought to come from regions where the gravitational field is very strong .",
    "study of these oscillations may provide the best near - term opportunity to observe and measure uniquely general relativistic effects , such as gravitomagnetic ( lense - thirring ) precession and the absence of stable circular orbits around sufficiently compact relativistic objects , and to determine the properties of the dense matter in neutron stars .",
    "_ rxte _ continues to provide a wealth of new information on conditions close to the surfaces of neutron stars and the event horizons of black holes and to stimulate imaginative new thinking about the physical processes that dominate in these extreme conditions .    in  2",
    "i summarize some of the most important properties of the x - ray oscillations seen in neutron star and black hole systems . in ",
    "3 i review some of the mechanisms that have been proposed for generating these oscillations , compare them with some of the data on neutron star and black hole qpos , and discuss the similarities and differences of qpo generation in neutron star and black hole systems . in  4 i describe how measurements of the highest - frequency qpos can be used to determine the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields . in  5",
    "i conclude with a few remarks about the progress we have made in understanding black hole and neutron star qpos and using them as tools to better understand the properties of strong gravitational fields and dense matter .",
    "there is space here to review only a fraction of the large body of work on these problems .",
    "i apologize to those whose work is not adequately discussed .",
    "this section summarizes several important properties of the oscillations that have been detected in the x - ray emission of accreting neutron stars and black holes .",
    "more detailed reviews of the observations may be found in van der klis ( 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "three classes of x - ray brightness oscillations have been detected in neutron stars in lmxbs : nearly periodic oscillations that , with one exception , have been detected only during thermonuclear x - ray bursts ; pairs of kilohertz qpos in accretion - powered emission ; and several lower - frequency qpos , also in accretion - powered emission .",
    "a key feature of the qpos and peaked noise components seen in neutron stars is that the frequencies of all of them ( except the recently identified hectohertz peaked noise component ) vary significantly and are positively correlated with each other and with the inferred x - ray flux ( see , e.g. , van straaten et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "_ x - ray burst oscillations_.x - ray flux oscillations with frequencies ranging from @xmath1330  hz to @xmath1590  hz have been detected during some of the thermonuclear x - ray bursts of ten neutron stars ( see strohmayer 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "these oscillations remain nearly sinusoidal and relatively stable ( @xmath4 ) even when their peak - to - peak amplitudes are @xmath170% and the luminosity of the star approaches the eddington critical luminosity at which the outward force of the radiation balances the inward force of gravity .",
    "this indicates that they are not caused by oscillations of the stellar surface or the accretion disk , because such oscillations would become nonlinear at high amplitudes and would also be affected by strong radiation forces .",
    "their stability is easier to understand if their frequencies are related to the spin of the star , which is very stable .",
    "the x - ray spectra , waveforms , and long - term stability of these oscillations indicate that they are generated by rotation of a brighter region , or two antipodal brighter regions , of the stellar surface ( strohmayer et al .  1996 , 1997 , 1998 ; bildsten 1998 ; miller & lamb 1998 ; markwardt , strohmayer , & swank 1999 ; miller 1999 ; strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ; strohmayer 1999 , 2001a , 2001b ; weinberg , miller , & lamb 2001 ) . if so , the frequency @xmath5 of the strongest oscillation is close to the stellar spin frequency @xmath6 or its second harmonic .",
    "the frequencies of the burst oscillations are comparable to the spin frequencies predicted by the recycling hypothesis for millisecond rotation - powered pulsars and the theory of disk accretion by weakly magnetic neutron stars ( see ghosh & lamb 1992 and references therein ) .    several properties of the burst oscillations are not yet understood .",
    "these properties include the relatively large fractional changes in frequency ( up to @xmath11.3% ) seen in some sources ( galloway et al .",
    "2000 ) , the simultaneous presence of several distinct frequencies ( miller 2000a ; galloway et al .",
    "2000 ; chakrabarty 2000 ) , phase shifts during some bursts that are @xmath110@xmath7 ( miller 1999b ) , and very low upper limits on the amplitudes of higher harmonics of the basic oscillation frequency in some sources ( strohmayer 2001a , 2001b ) .    a strong ( amplitude @xmath150% )",
    "brightness oscillation has recently been found in data taken during a 1997 thermonuclear x - ray burst from ( int zand et al .",
    "this source is an accretion - powered x - ray pulsar ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) in a low - mass binary system ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "the frequency of the burst oscillation is within a few hertz of the 401  hz spin frequency inferred from the periodic modulation of its accretion - powered emission .",
    "the burst oscillation could be produced by a mechanism different from the mechanism that produces the burst oscillations seen in other neutron - star lmxbs , but this seems unlikely .",
    "thus , although the detailed physics of the burst oscillations is not yet understood , the evidence that they are generated by the spin of the neutron star is strong .",
    "_ kilohertz qpos_.qpos with frequencies between @xmath1500  hz and @xmath11300  hz have now been detected in the accretion - powered emission of more than twenty neutron stars in lmxbs ( see van der klis 2000 ) .",

    "1995 and references therein ) show that at low accretion rates , the azimuthal drag force exerted by radiation from a relativistic star on gas orbiting near it removes angular momentum from the gas sufficiently quickly that the gas accelerates radially inward , causing the radial flow to become supersonic before it reaches the star or the isco , if one exists .",
    "this is an effect of strong - field general relativity ( a transition of this type is not possible in newtonian gravity ) .",
    "to lowest order , the radius @xmath54 of the sonic point is determined by balancing the angular momentum brought into the interaction region by the accretion flow , which is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mean specific angular momentum of the accreting gas , and the angular momentum removed from the flow by the radiation drag , which is @xmath57 . hence to lowest order , @xmath54 is independent of @xmath58 .",
    "however , the optical depth of the flow from the disk to the stellar surface increases with @xmath58 , reducing the radiation drag as @xmath58 increases .",

    "if the neutron star is so large that there is no isco , the region of nearly circular flow may extend to the stellar surface .",
    "miller , lamb , & psaltis ( 1998b , 1998c ) and lamb , miller , & psaltis ( 1998b ) showed that inhomogeneities in the accretion flow near @xmath54 produce two related high - frequency qpos .",

    "the frequency of this oscillation is usually less than the frequency @xmath63 of a general relativistic keplerian circular orbit at @xmath54 , because the radial component of the radiation force causes @xmath62 to be less than @xmath63 and the radially inward drift of the clumps causes the footprint to move around the star with a frequency less than @xmath62 ( lamb & miller 2001 ) .",

    "the radiation coming from the surface of a neutron star is dynamically important .",
    "the neutron stars in lmxbs are thought to be the progenitors of the recycled radio pulsars ( see ghosh & lamb 1992 ; kulkarni & phinney 1994 ; lorimer 2001 ) and to have @xmath110@xmath19110@xmath192  g dipole magnetic fields .",
    "there is also a fairly large body of indirect evidence for such fields ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "surface fields @xmath193  g have dynamical effects on the accretion flow near the stellar surface ( ghosh & lamb 1992 ) and would be expected to affect the properties of qpos that originate within a few stellar radii .",
    "the exterior spacetimes of neutron stars and black holes are also different and hence the frequencies of dynamical motions near them are different ( see , e.g. , miller et al .",
    "the two most important differences are their masses and angular momenta . for fixed @xmath104 , the dynamical frequencies near neutron stars and black holes scale as @xmath194 .",
    "the masses of black holes in lmxbs are typically @xmath4710 times larger than the masses of neutron stars , so dynamical frequencies near them should be @xmath4710 times lower for the same @xmath104 .",
    "however , @xmath104 is limited to @xmath195 for realistic models of neutron stars but can approach unity for black holes .",
    "gravitomagnetic frequencies , and hence the frequencies of the @xmath110- and @xmath112-modes , can therefore be much higher near black holes .    because of these important differences between neutron stars and black holes , it would be surprising if the highest - frequency qpos produced by these objects , which presumably are generated close to their surfaces and event horizons , respectively , have identical properties .    -0.2 truecm -0.5 truecm    _ frequency correlations_.psaltis et al .",
    "( 1999a ; see also van der klis 2000 ) have called attention to correlations between the frequencies of some of the low- and medium - frequency qpos and noise components observed in several black hole sources and the similarity of the slopes of these correlations to the slopes of some of the frequency correlations observed in neutron star sources ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : imbroglio ] ) .",
    "these frequency variations are thought to reflect changes in the accretion rate .",
    "psaltis et al .",
    "have suggested that some of these power spectral features may have similar origins in neutron stars and black holes .",
    "their high and relatively stable frequencies and other properties seem to set the high - frequency qpo pairs seen in and apart from the other black hole qpos ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imbroglio ] and  2.2 ) . as discussed  3.3",
    ", the highest frequencies may be orbital frequencies or the frequencies of disk oscillations near the isco .",
    "it appears that the differences between the highest frequencies seen in these two sources are not due solely to their different masses .",
    "if so , the mechanisms involved must be at least somewhat different .",
    "the frequencies of the upper kilohertz qpos also stand apart in figure  [ fig : imbroglio ] .",
    "these are thought to be the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the nearly circular flow around the neutron star ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "if the qpo mechanisms in neutron stars and black holes are indeed the same , it is somewhat puzzling that this fundamental frequency has not been detected in most black holes .",
    "the frequency correlations of the lower kilohertz and low - frequency qpos in atoll sources such as and are separated from the main correlation line established by the frequency correlations of the lower kilohertz and horizontal - branch qpos in the z sources and the peculiar source by a factor @xmath12 and seem to have a much steeper slope .",
    "the frequencies of the medium- and low - frequency qpos in and are separated from the main correlation line by a factor @xmath12 and do not establish a clear correlation .",
    "these examples indicate that not all qpo frequencies are correlated in the same way and hence that it is possible that different mechanisms are involved in different types of sources .",
    "the main correlation line that is evident in figure  [ fig : imbroglio ] is established by correlations of the lower kilohertz and low - frequency qpos in the z sources and especially in the peculiar source and the correlations of the two low - frequency qpos in several black holes , which fall approximately on the same line in the frequency - frequency plane .",
    "it is also worth noting that it is the frequencies of the two most prominent band - limited noise components in the power spectrum of , not the qpo frequencies , that appear to follow roughly the main correlation seen in figure  [ fig : imbroglio ] ( see nowak 2001 ) .",
    "_ physical origins of frequency correlations_.there are several possible ways that the frequency correlations evident in figure  [ fig : imbroglio ] might be explained .",
    "one possibility is that two qpos are generated at a single radius and scale with radius in approximately the same way , so that when the radius changes with accretion rate , they trace out a one - parameter curve in the frequency - frequency plane . for example , at large distances from neutron stars and black holes ( @xmath196 ) , the nodal and apsidal precession frequencies satisfy @xmath197 ( see  3.1 and markovi 2000 ) and are therefore almost proportional to one another .",
    "if @xmath198 is plotted versus @xmath199 , the points will fall on a line with a slope of 1.2 , close to the slope of the main correlation in figure  [ fig : imbroglio ] .",
    "moreover , both @xmath165 and @xmath200 are steep functions of radius ( in relativistic units , @xmath201 while @xmath202 ) , so only a modest variation in the radius at which the qpos are produced can produce a large variation in their frequencies",
    ". such a mechanism might be relevant to the frequencies of the low frequency and lower - kilohertz qpos generated by , which vary by a factor @xmath120 .",
    "if either of these are orbital frequencies , the radius at which they are generated would have to vary by a factor @xmath203 or more , which would be difficult to understand ( see below ) , whereas if they are precession frequencies , a variation in radius of a factor of 1.8 would be sufficient .",
    "the qpo frequencies are in approximately the right range to be precession frequencies ( see stella et al .",
    "1999 ) and a slope of 1.2 may describe their correlation better than a slope of 1 .",
    "sometimes an apparent power - law frequency correlation over a limited range of frequencies may be explained by a model that does not predict a power - law relation .",
    "for example , the phenomenological power - law relation @xmath204 accurately describes the observed correlation between the frequencies of the hbo and upper kilohertz qpo in the z sources , but so does the relation @xmath205 , which is predicted by the magnetospheric beat - frequency model ( see psaltis et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "these considerations underscore the importance of paying attention to the whole spectrum of information we now have on the phenomenology of the different qpos , not just their frequencies .",
    "of particular importance is how the individual qpo frequencies vary with accretion rate , because this variation is an important guide to the physical mechanism(s ) involved .",
    "_ the challenge of variable frequencies_.i have already noted that large variations in the frequencies of qpos are challenging for physical theories .",
    "this is particularly true if the oscillations are highly coherent ; understanding large variations in the frequencies of peaked or band - limited noise components is generally less demanding .",
    "several qpo models are based on the existence of one or more special radii in the disk that decrease substantially as the accretion rate increases .",
    "a key question is , what physics picks out a special radius and causes it to vary by a substantial factor as the accretion rate changes by , e.g. , @xmath150% ?    to my knowledge , the only mechanism so far identified that picks out a special radius that decreases markedly as the accretion rate increases is the radiation drag mechanism that is at the heart of the sonic - point model ( see  3.1 ) . in its original form , this mechanism can explain a variation in the radius of the sonic point by a factor @xmath13 , from @xmath206 to @xmath207 .",
    "the radius and radius range could be greater if radiation drag only needs to act on a small fraction of the accretion flow , such as gas on the surface of the disk , to make a qpo mechanism work .",
    "it is possible that the radiation - drag mechanism could also work in black hole systems , although this possibility has not been studied in any detail .",
    "the radiation drag mechanism has been invoked to explain the existence of the special radii needed in models other than the sonic - point model .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the radiation force has important dynamical effects on the accretion flow over an extended region , where it changes both the orbital and the radial velocities of the flow .",
    "these effects , as well as the existence of a sonic radius , must be taken into account in any self - consistent model of the formation of qpos near neutron stars .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , almost all qpo models developed since the launch of _ rxte _ have considered the effects of strong - field gravity . in this sense ,",
    "the qpos themselves provide information on gas dynamics and radiation transport in strongly curved spacetimes . in this section",
    "i discuss briefly how the kilohertz qpos can be used to extract further information about the properties of strong gravitational fields and dense matter .",
    "-0.9 truecm -0.7 truecm    assuming that the upper kilohertz qpo at @xmath9 is produced by orbital motion of gas near the neutron star , its behavior can be used to investigate orbits in the region of strongly curved spacetime near the star .",
    "for example , it may be possible to establish the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around some neutron stars in lmxbs ( see kaaret & ford 1997 ; miller et al .  1998b , 1998c ; lamb et al .",
    "this would be an important step forward in our understanding of strong - field gravity and the properties of dense matter , because it would be the first confirmation of a prediction of general relativity in the strong - field regime .",
    "possible signatures of the isco have been discussed by miller et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and lamb et al .",
    "( 1998a , 1998c ) .",
    "the sonic - point model predicts that the frequencies of both kilohertz qpos will increase with the accretion luminosity until the sonic radius  which moves inward as the mass flux through the inner disk increases  reaches the isco , at which point it will become independent of the accretion luminosity ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pie - plateau ] ) .",
    "the plateau frequency is the orbital frequency of the isco .",

    "( 1999 ) , and bloser et al .",

    "-0 truecm -5.4 truecm -0.4 truecm    although the observed variations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with countrate ( and x - ray flux ) are very similar to the relation predicted by the sonic - point model , several questions must be answered before these results can be accepted as compelling evidence of an isco .",
    "for example , how robust is the predicted relation between qpo frequency and @xmath58 ?",
    "what is the expected behavior of the kilohertz qpo amplitudes as the sonic point reaches the radius of the isco ?",
    "naively , one would expect the amplitude of the qpo at the beat frequency to decrease .",

    "these constraints can be determined for any stellar spin frequency ( see miller et al .",
    "1998b ; miller , lamb , & cook 1998 ) , but it is easier to see how they are obtained for a nonrotating star .",
    "i therefore consider this case here .",

    "if one can establish that a given qpo frequency is the frequency of the isco , for example by detecting a stable plateau in the qpo frequency - luminosity relation , the mass of the star can be determined .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : pie - plateau ] shows how this can be done for a nonrotating star .",
    "if an observed value of @xmath9 is the frequency of the isco , the radius of the orbit involved must lie on the diagonal dashed line as well as on the cubic curve that corresponds to @xmath9 , i.e. , it is at the intersection of the two .",
    "this fixes the mass of the star for a given proposed eos ( miller et al .",

    "if confirmed , such a high mass would imply that the three - nucleon interaction is highly repulsive at high densities and probably that there is no quark matter at the center of even such a massive neutron star .",
