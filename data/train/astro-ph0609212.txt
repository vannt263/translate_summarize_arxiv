    "young massive star clusters , potential young globular clusters , have been revealed by ground - based imaging @xcite and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "these clusters appear to be a few myr in age , @xmath3 - @xmath4 in mass , and 10 pc or smaller in diameter .",
    "the youth of these clusters means that , unlike globular clusters , their luminosities are dominated by a population of massive stars .",
    "young , massive star clusters appear to be common @xcite in the centers of late - type spirals , and may play an important role in galactic nuclear activity . how these large star clusters form and the environments favoring their formation are not understood .",
    "the identification of young super star clusters in nearby galaxies gives us the chance to study these clusters in the process of formation .",
    "in nearby starburst galaxies , extremely compact sources with rising spectral indices at centimeter wavelengths have been discovered , which are thought to be  supernebulae \" surrounding very young super star clusters ( ssc ) .",
    "these nebulae have the characteristics of dense , compact hii  regions in the galaxy , and by analogy are also expected to be very young , @xmath01 myr or less .",
    "however , they are much larger than galactic compact hii  regions , requiring the excitation of hundreds to thousands of young o stars @xcite .",
    "these young clusters may be optically obscured by their natal gas and dust clouds @xcite , particularly in molecular gas - rich galactic centers .",
    "free - free emission from embedded hii  regions at radio wavelengths is unaffected by extinction from molecular clouds .",
    "radio continuum emission can be used to search for the youngest , potentially embedded young hii  regions in other galaxies .",
    "the goal of this investigation is to identify young ssc candidates in four nearby and well - studied spiral galaxies , ic 342 , maffei ii , ngc 2903 , and ngc 6946 using subarcsecond radio continuum imaging .",
    "the centers of these galaxies are infrared - bright @xcite and molecular gas rich @xcite .",
    "previous , lower ( @xmath5 ) resolution _ vla _ maps have shown that the four galaxies have concentrated regions of star formation in their centers @xcite .",
    "however , the low resolution of these maps , @xmath0 20 - 70 pc on the galaxy , combines emission from hii  regions , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and extended non - thermal emission within the beam . to isolate nebulae around individual star clusters we need subarcsecond resolution .",
    "subarcsecond imaging with the _ vla _ in its extended configuration maximizes sensitivity to bright and compact radio nebulae over low brightness disk synchrotron emission .",
    "observing at shorter wavelengths , @xmath6 2 cm , also minimizes the contribution of synchrotron emission , which falls with frequency .",
    "we present maps of the radio continuum emission at 6 and 2 cm in ic 342 , maffei ii , ngc 2903 , and ngc 6946 with the a configuration of the _ vla_. the images have resolutions of 03 at 6 cm and 01 at 2 cm , corresponding to size scales of 3 ( ic 342 and maffei  2 ) - 11 ( ngc 6946 ) pc on the galaxies .",
    "table 1 lists basic properties for the four spiral galaxies . in all four",
    "there is prior evidence for compact radio continuum sources @xcite .",
    "the radio data were acquired at the nrao very large array using the a configuration .",
    "previously unpublished 6 cm continuum data were obtained on 1988 november 18 and 20 ( program at98 ) , and 2 cm data on 1983 october 12 ( program i d ah141 ) and 1999 august 23 ( program at227 ) .",
    "the 2  cm observations in august 1999 were made using fast - switching , with cycle times of 2 minutes .",
    "on source integration times were @xmath0 1 hour at both wavelengths .",
    "data calibration was done by using _ aips _ , following high frequency reduction procedures for the 2  cm calibration .",
    "the sources 3c 48 , 3c 138 , 3c 147 , and 3c 286 are used as flux calibrators .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is @xmath7 .",
    "observational parameters are shown in table 2 .    to enhance the sensitivity",
    ", we combined our _ vla _ a - configuration data with previously published _ vla _ archival data listed in table 2 .",
    "data sets of a- , b- , or c - configurations with time on source @xmath8 10 minutes and phase center within 18 arcsec ( 1/10 of _ vla _ primary beam at 2  cm ) from centers of our measurements were used .",
    "observations with b1950 equinox coordinates were precessed to j2000 coordinates ; uncertainty for this conversion is @xmath020 mas .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute position is determined by the b1950 calibrator positions , which are good to 50 mas .",
    "spectral index measurements were done with a separate set of maps with matching ( _ u , v _ ) coverages at 6 and 2  cm , which include matched shortest baselines of a - configuration at 2  cm and longest baselines of a - configuration at 6  cm .",
    "the largest angular scales sampled by the images are @xmath0 @xmath9 .",
    "fluxes and peak fluxes are therefore lower limits to the total flux if extended emission is present .",
    "the images were then convolved to the same beamsize , to have matching maximum baseline lengths .",
    "final rms noise levels in blank regions of maps are @xmath0 0.05 , 0.04 , 0.03 , and 0.03  mjy / beam for ic 342 , maffei 2 , ngc 2903 , and ngc  6946 respectively at 6  cm , and @xmath0 0.09 , 0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.14  mjy / beam at 2  cm .    while it is impossible to precisely match ( _ u , v _ ) coverages nor to quantify the differences without prior knowledge of the extended source structure , the ( _ u , v _ ) plane is well sampled and we estimate that differences between the maps caused by the differences in undersampled extended emission ( @xmath10 ) must be less than the total resolved out flux divided by this area , which comes to less than our noise level",
    ". since the compact sources we identify are all much less than 10  in extent , the effects on our fluxes with differences in ( _ u , v _ ) coverages will be undetectable .",
    "interferometer maps are high - pass filtered images and it is difficult to assign uncertainties without knowing the extended structure , which is not known a priori .",
    "point sources , and sources that are well - sampled by the ( u , v ) coverage will have uncertainties that are described well by the rms noise .",
    "most of our sources fall into this category .",
    "we have fitted sizes to the extended sources to better estimate flux uncertainties for these sources .",
    "although the differences between 6 and 2  cm spatial sampling may not affect compact source fluxes , we stress that there is extended unresolved flux in these maps .",
    "one generally compares single dish fluxes to mapped _ vla _ fluxes to estimate how much extended emission is resolved out of the _ vla _ maps . in this case , the disparity between single dish beams , typically a few arcminutes in size , and our sub - arcsecond beams makes this comparison difficult .",
    "we therefore compare our compact source fluxes to lower resolution vla maps in b and c configuration ( shown in table 1 ) to see how much flux is resolved out ; these lower resolution maps are sensitive to structures up to @xmath11 across at 6  cm and 2  cm , except the case of ngc  2903 , in which the c - array flux at 6  cm ( sensitive to structure @xmath12 in size ) has been quoted .",
    "the total mapped fluxes indicate that our maps recover 15 - 45% of the 6  cm flux in the lower resolution observations , and 20 - 45% of the 2 cm flux , in both compact and extended components .",
    "the 6  cm radio continuum maps and _ k_-band ( 2.2@xmath13 m ) images of the four galaxies are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the naturally - weighted radio contours are overlaid on _ 2 micron all sky survey _ ( _ 2mass _ ) _ k_-band images on the left . in each of the galaxies",
    "the nucleus is a strong @xmath14 m source and the 6  cm continuum is strongest at the center .",
    "we see emission from the central @xmath0 150 pc except in the case of maffei ii , in which the emission extends over a distance of @xmath0 350  pc .",
    "the 6  cm maps on the right - hand side of figure 1 , contoured at the same 4  @xmath15 levels as in the overlay on the left - hand side , are closeups of the radio emission region within the central @xmath16 - @xmath17 . in each source",
    "there are strong compact sources embedded in extended emission .",
    "the western part of the extended emission in ic 342 contains 5 sources aligned from north - west to south - east ( named a - e in table 3 ) while the eastern part has fewer sources and their emission is also significantly weaker .",
    "ten sources are identified in maffei ii , spread out over 10@xmath18 ( @xmath0 240  pc ) north - south on the eastern edge of the extended emission .",
    "6 cm continuum emission in ngc 2903 and ngc 6949 is confined to single central sources surrounded by extended emission .",

    "we separated this uncertainty from signal to noise , which is listed in the table 3 .    in table 4",
    ", we list the properties of each compact radio source .",
    "the spectral index is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath27 , the spectral index between 2 and 6  cm wavelengths , are derived with @xmath28 variances of flux densities in both wavebands ; uncertainties are typically @xmath290.2 - 0.3 . for sources a - d and i in the extended emission complex of ngc  6946",
    ", we derive the @xmath19 from their intensities , which are well - determined , rather than their fluxes , which are more uncertain .",
    "based on the values of @xmath27 ( discussed in the next section ) , we classified sources as optically thick hii  regions ( hii , thick ) , optically thin hii  regions ( hii , thin ) , supernova remnants ( snr ) , or radio supernovae ( rsn ) .",

    "electron temperatures of hii  regions tend to be cooler toward the high - metallicity centers of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath30 will be @xmath0 15% lower than listed , if @xmath32 6,000  k rather than the adopted @xmath33  k. @xmath34 is the number of standard o7 stars needed to generate @xmath30 .",
    "we also assume ionization - bonded nebulae ; if uv photons escape the hii  region , our ob luminosities will be underestimates of the true lyman continuum rates .",
    "the radio images reveal a population of bright compact radio sources in the centers of ic 342 , maffei 2 , ngc 6946 , and ngc 2903 .",
    "the sources are comparable in extent to the 03 beam , or @xmath0 5 - 10 pc in diameter .",
    "what are these sources ?",
    "the cm - wave continuum emission from nearby normal galaxies is a mixture of synchrotron emission from snrs and disk cosmic rays , and thermal bremsstrahlung emission from hii  regions .",
    "spectral index @xmath19 is an indicator of the emission mechanism : optically thin free - free emission has @xmath35 , while optically thin non - thermal emission by synchrotron radiation will have steeper negative spectral indices .",
    "galactic snr have @xmath36 @xmath37 to @xmath38 , with the majority in the range @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "steeper @xmath41 are characteristic of short - lived rsne @xcite , and of extended synchrotron disk emission .",
    "hii  regions are optically thick at wavelengths longer than a turnover frequency that depends on the electron temperature and emission measure , em=@xmath42 . at long wavelengths ,",
    "hii  regions are bright , and their fluxes rise with frequency until the turnover frequency .",
    "the higher the emission measure , the higher the turnover frequency .",
    "spectra of diffuse or  classical \" ( @xmath43 ) hii  regions that appear in visible wavelengths typically turn over at meter wavelengths and are optically thin at cm wavelengths .",
    "a cm - wave turnover frequency is characteristic of compact or ultracompact hii  regions @xcite , which have @xmath44 .    beyond the local group ,",
    "ultracompact hii  regions typical of those in our galactic disk , excited by individual o stars or small clusters , are small in size and thus too faint to be seen @xcite .",
    "the compact component @xcite of the luminous galactic hii  region w49 would fail to meet our detection criteria in our closest galaxy ( ic 342 ) , as would the radio source @xcite of ngc 3606 . however , if the clusters are somewhat larger , with at least 200 o stars surrounded by an ionization - bounded volume of gas , even dense , compact hii  regions , with @xmath44 , can be detected in external galaxies @xcite . even for the largest clusters ( @xmath45 ) , dense , compact hii  regions will still be small , less than 2 - 3 pc in size .",
    "since large numbers of massive stars can also be accompanied by supernovae , thermal free - free emission from these hii  regions can be mixed with nonthermal emission within a single beam if the resolution is low @xcite .",
    "confusion is minimized if the resolution is high , and the galaxy is nearby , so that the beam closely matches the size of a single hii  region .",
    "subarcsecond imaging maximizes our sensitivity to these sources .",
    "more than half of the 38 identified compact sources of table  4 appear to be hii  regions .",
    "a significant fraction may have rising spectra , indicating that they are at least partly optically thick at 6  cm .",
    "given the likely presence of nonthermal synchrotron emission in the vicinity of these star - forming regions , the spectral indices could systematically be even higher than we measure here , due to spectral confusion @xcite .",
    "rising cm - wave spectra imply that the rms electron densities are @xmath46 .",
    "that a large percentage of our sources are ultracompact hii  regions might be expected from the subarcsecond resolution , which picks out these high brightness regions .",
    "there may be lower density , extended and less bright hii  regions that are below the brightness limit of these maps .",
    "the sizes of the compact hii  regions listed in table 3 are obtained from deconvolution of the beam from the observed source in the 2 cm map , assuming that the sources are gaussian .",
    "( they are probably not gaussian in structure , but this gives us approximate source sizes . )",
    "uncertainties in the sizes , due to beam size , source structure , and signal - to - noise ratio , are @xmath24 30% of the beam .",
    "the derived source sizes in ic 342 , maffei ii , and ngc 2903 are @xmath47 , but @xmath00.5@xmath18 in ngc 6946 .",
    "sources with larger deconvolved sizes in ngc 6946 are nebulae joined with the large emission complex at the center , and suffer from confusion . seeing may be a problem at 2  cm .",
    "the similarity of the source sizes suggest this may be the case ; it is likely , therefore , that the sizes we obtain are upper limits to the true source sizes .",
    "the deconvolved sizes correspond to diameters of @xmath0 6 - 14  pc .",
    "these hii  regions are significantly smaller than the 30 doradus hii  region ( @xmath0 200  pc in diameter for region of @xmath48 ; see @xcite and @xcite ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "they are larger but similar in nature to the galactic compact hii  regions in w49 @xcite and ngc 3603 @xcite .",
    "one possibility for the fact that these hii  regions are relatively compact and dense is that they are younger than 30 doradus or ngc 3603 . because these regions are nearly unresolved , and because we do not have good radio seds , at this stage we can not model their properties with precision .",
    "the estimated sizes of these nebulae are similar to the pc - sized diameters of the supernebulae found in ngc 5253 and ii zw 40 @xcite .",
    "these hii  regions have ionized gas densities at least as high as @xmath49 ; they are dense , with high pressures .",
    "the compactness of these optically thick hii  regions implies some degree of youth , although hii  regions around massive young clusters may differ dynamically and evolve differently from galactic compact hii  regions @xcite .",
    "the radio fluxes of these compact hii  regions require that they harbor hundreds of massive stars .",
    "the luminosities of the clusters exciting the hii  regions can be inferred from their lyman continuum rates using @xmath50 for a salpeter imf .",
    "the inferred luminosities are not very sensitive to imf since luminosity , like ionizing photons , is dominated by the most massive stars .",
    "the cluster luminosities inferred from the free - free emission are @xmath51 .",
    "based on their luminosities , the largest of these radio clusters have roughly an order of magnitude more stars than the r 136 cluster within 30 doradus @xcite , or in the clusters within the large galactic hii  region ngc 3603 @xcite or w49 @xcite .",
    "the total lyman continuum rate , @xmath30 , is derived from the total flux from thermal compact sources , assuming the emission is optically thin and the hii  regions are ionization - bounded .",
    "these values are compared with @xmath30 rates derived from millimeter continuum , which are unlikley to suffer from opacity effects . in ic 342 ,",
    "the estimated @xmath30 is @xmath52 for six thermal compact sources .",
    "this can be compared with the value of @xmath53 obtained by @xcite ( @xcite ; corrected for distance ) for the central @xmath16 region derived from 2.6 mm continuum , and @xmath54 for the two major 2.6 cm peaks corresponding to the central starburst regions . over the central @xmath55 region of ngc 6946",
    ", @xmath30 is @xmath56 , as derived from the 2.7 mm images of @xcite ( @xcite ; corrected to our distance ) .",
    "similar agreement is also found in maffei ii between the @xmath30 inferred by thermal fluxes in mm @xcite and cm ( this work ) .",
    "these numbers imply that the fluxes of compact sources make up at least 50 % of the total @xmath30 photons seen towards the starburst peaks in lower resolution images .",
    "the fact that the mm emission gives higher values for @xmath30 suggests that some of the thermal sources are optically thick at cm wavelengths , or that some of the thermal flux is extended , or both .",
    "the existence of massive stars within these clusters indicates their youth .",
    "because the local star formation is expected to be suppressed by massive star feedback of mechanical energy through winds and supernovae , we expect the stars in these large clusters to be coeval to within a few myr .",
    "thus they are presumably located inside and co - moving with their parent molecular clouds , and should be close to the sites at which they formed . given that these hii  regions are compact and quite dense ,",
    "it is likely that they may be significantly younger than the @xmath0 10 myr we might infer from the presence of massive stars .    the young , massive clusters in ic 342 and maffei ii ( shown in figure 2 and 3 ) are aligned with dust lanes and molecular gas .",
    "these nebulae are found in coherent structures extending over regions 110 pc ( ic 342 ) - 240 pc ( maffei 2 ) in size .",
    "the sound crossing times for these distances are 10 - 25  myr , if the sound speed is @xmath010  km / s .",
    "this timescale is comparable to or longer than the lifetimes of massive stars . from the youth inferred from the high gas densities and from the spatial distribution of these hii  regions along the co arms ,",
    "we conclude that the formation of young , massive stellar clusters in compact nebulae found in ic 342 and maffei ii is mainly triggered by large scale resonant features ( i.e. , gas arms associated with spiral density wave / bar features ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with their locations with respect to optical dust lanes ( figures 2 - 5 ) .",
    "comparing with the _ hst _ images ( figure 2 - 5 ) , we find that only a small fraction of the radio hii  regions have possible optical counterparts .",
    "the extinction in embedded hii  regions is often internal to the nebulae @xcite , but it is also possible that the compact nebulae are hidden behind the foreground clouds or embedded in their host giant molecular clouds . if we assume that all of the luminosity comes out in the infrared , the implied @xmath57 of our compact sources amounts to only 3 - 5% of the total ir luminosities of the galaxies ( table 1 ) .    the young nebulae are all located within the central @xmath0 100  pc except in maffei ii , where the hii  regions extend over @xmath0 250 pc . to support the formation of numerous massive stars",
    ", there should be high molecular gas concentrations . in all four galaxies , the central regions have molecular gas surface densities",
    "3 - 9 times higher @xcite than do typical spiral galaxies on size scales of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the high concentrations of molecular gas ( @xmath58 within central @xmath9 ; @xcite ) lead to high internal visual extinctions @xmath59 of up to tens to hundreds of magnitudes @xcite toward these galactic centers .",
    "the young star clusters associated with the radio nebulae are preferentially found projected onto the centers of giant molecular clouds (  4.3 ) .",
    "this means that there is a wealth of gas around the star clusters to fuel more star formation , unlike the high star formation efficiency inferred from the lack of gas in the super star clusters found in the dwarf galaxy ngc 5253 @xcite .",
    "given the proximity of molecular clouds to these clusters , and their location in the centers of large spiral galaxies , it is unlikely that any of the young clusters associated with the radio nebulae in these four spirals will become long - lived , gravitationally bound clusters , i.e. , globular clusters .",
    "nearly two dozen radio sources in the four galaxies were found to have flat or rising spectra ( table 4 ) .",

    "the power law index we obtain is close to the average value of @xmath68 in 30 nearby spiral and irregular galaxies from an optical study of hii  regions by @xcite .",
    "however , the slope of the lf for the more luminous hii  regions of our sample is shallower than the slope in the two component power law lf , or `` type ii '' lf , found in optical studies of other spiral galaxies , m 51 , ngc 3521 , ngc 3627 , ngc 4736 @xcite , and ngc 7714 @xcite .",
    "the optical studies also show the turnover point at lower luminosity ( at @xmath69 ) . a possible explanation for this difference might be that the luminous sources we found are very young and obscured , thus not detected in the optical , although this may also be small - number statistics .",
    "the flattening of the lf at the faint end may be caused by incompleteness due to both limited sensitivity and partially resolving out extended hii  regions .",
