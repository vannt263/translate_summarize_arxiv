    "the motivation for this experiment is that if the intensity in the stacked dark trough is mainly contributed by the lyman continua of the foreground dla , then this intensity should be uncorrelated with the background quasar luminosity , and we expect the three luminosity bins to yield similar intensities in the dark trough .",

    "<S> in merger - driven models of massive galaxy evolution , the luminous quasar phase is expected to be accompanied by vigorous star formation in quasar host galaxies . in this paper , we use high column density damped lyman alpha ( dla ) systems along quasar sight lines as natural coronagraphs to directly study the far - uv ( fuv ) radiation from the host galaxies of luminous background quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we have stacked the spectra of @xmath02,000 dla systems ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) with a median absorption redshift @xmath3 selected from quasars observed in the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey . </S>",
    "<S> we detect residual flux in the dark troughs of the composite dla spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the level of this residual flux significantly exceeds systematic errors in the sdss fiber sky subtraction ; furthermore , the residual flux is strongly correlated with the continuum luminosity of the background quasar , while uncorrelated with dla column density or metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the flux could be associated with the average fuv radiation from the background quasar host galaxies ( with medium redshift @xmath4 ) that is not blocked by the intervening dla . assuming all of the detected flux originates from quasar hosts , for the highest quasar luminosity bin ( @xmath52.5@xmath6 ) , the host galaxy has a fuv intensity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 @xmath8 ; this corresponds to an unobscured uv star formation rate of 9 m@xmath9 yr@xmath8 . </S>"
