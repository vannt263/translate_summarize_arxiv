    "the collapse transition of a polymer in a dilute solution has been a focus of study in lattice statistical mechanics for decades @xcite . any lattice model of a collapsing polymer has two key ingredients : an excluded volume effect expressing the impenetrability of monomers , and a short - range attractive force , which mimics the complex monomer - solvent interaction .",
    "when the effects of the excluded volume and the short - range attraction balance each other , the polymer undergoes a collapse transition which separates two distinct phases : a swollen and a collapsed phase .    the canonical lattice model of the configurations of a polymer in solution has been the model of self - avoiding walks ( saw ) where a random walk on a lattice is not allowed to visit a lattice site more than once",
    ". saw display the desired excluded volume effect and are swollen in size relative to unrestricted random walks at the same length . a common way to introduce a short - range interaction",
    "is to assign a negative energy to each non - consecutive pair of monomers lying on neighbouring lattice sites , modelling an effective attractive force .",
    "this is the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model , which is the standard lattice model of polymer collapse using self - avoiding walks .    a different model of a collapsing model",
    "can be constructed starting from self - avoiding trails . a self - avoiding trail ( sat )",
    "is a lattice walk configuration where the excluded volume is obtained by preventing the walk from visiting the same bond , rather than the same site , more than once .",
    "this is a slightly weaker restriction , and saw configurations are a proper subset of sat configurations .",
    "the interacting version of self - avoiding trails ( isat ) , customarily obtained by giving an energy to multiple visited sites , also presents a collapse transition .",
    "it is known that saw and sat share the same statistics in their high - temperature phase @xcite , but theoretical prediction and numerical evidence @xcite strongly suggests that the collapse transition of the isat model is in a different universality class to that of isaw , although there is not completely understood why this would be the case . to be more specific",
    ", it is predicted that the collapse transition in isaw is a second - order phase transition with a convergent specific heat in accordance with the theoretical description first provided by duplantier and saleur @xcite as described below . on the other hand",
    ", isat shows a strongly divergent specific heat at its collapse point .    a recent study @xcite considered self - avoiding trails interacting via nearest - neighbour contacts ( innsat ) as a hybrid of the two models .",
    "evidence from computer simulations showed that the collapse transition in innsat is different from the collapse transition in isat , but similar to isaw .",
    "it was also found that the low - temperature phase of the two trail - collapse models differ substantially .",
    "the phase associated with multiply visited site interactions is fully dense in the thermodynamic limit , while the phase associated with nearest - neighbour contacts seems indistinguishable from the low - temperature phase of interacting self - avoiding walks .",
    "the properties of lattice polymers are also related to those of magnetic systems near their critical point @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the scaling properties of self - avoiding walks are connected to the critical properties of a spin system with @xmath0 symmetry in the formal limit of zero components ( @xmath1 ) . from this point of view",
    "the collapse transition corresponds to a tri - critical point of such systems @xcite .",
    "various authors @xcite have studied critical and tri - critical @xmath0 spin systems . for a special choice of the model on the honeycomb lattice",
    ", exact results were obtained in @xcite for two cases : a critical point and a special point governing the low - temperature phase .",
    "when @xmath1 these two cases become the _ dilute _ and _ dense _ polymer phase . the dilute and dense phases",
    "were also found along two branches of a square - lattice @xmath0 model @xcite together with two different branches describing the critical behaviour that occurs when @xmath0 and ising degrees of freedom on the square lattice display a joint critical point .    on the other hand , duplantier and saleur in 1987",
    "@xcite realised that the bond interaction of isaw could be obtained by introducing vacancies on the honeycomb lattice . using this observation",
    "they could obtain the critical exponents for the polymer collapse transition in the isaw model .",
    "we will refer to the universality class of this critical point as the ` @xmath2-point ' .",
    "an exact description has now been proposed @xcite for the tri - critical @xmath0 model in two dimensions as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "when it comes to isat the scenario is much less clear , in particular it not obvious how the change of topology caused by the presence of crossings affects the above picture .",
    "the description in terms of height model and coulomb gas allows one to consider the presence of crossings only as a perturbation .",
    "the exponent associated to loop crossings is the same as that of cubic symmetry breaking , which is known to be irrelevant in the critical @xmath0 phase , but it has been observed @xcite that this is not true in the low - temperature phase , where the introduction of crossings is a relevant operator which leads to a different universality class .",
    "this is generically referred to as the _ goldstone phase _ and it is believed @xcite to be described by the intersecting loop model proposed in @xcite and since called the brauer model @xcite .",
    "the relevance of crossings at the tri - critical point ( the @xmath2-point when @xmath1 ) is not clear . while the cubic perturbation is still believed to be relevant @xcite , a recent numerical study @xcite seems to indicate that the @xmath2-point is stable in the presence of crossings , at least with respect to the cross - over and length - scale exponents .",
    "very recently nahum _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite published a study of loop models with crossings .",
    "their analysis is based on a replica limit of the @xmath4 model on real projective space @xmath5 .",
    "they give a field theoretic description of the isat which explains the phase diagram found numerically in @xcite and suggests that the isat collapse transition is an infinite - order multi - critical point .      in this paper",
    "we consider a polymer model of self - avoiding trails with both multiply - visited site and nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "this model generalises isat and innsat .",
    "it also contains in a limiting case the isaw model , when the boltzmann weight associated with multiply visited sites is sent to zero .",
    "we study the model via computer simulations using the flatperm algorithm , and so extend the study of innsat in @xcite .",
    "we point out that this model has been studied some time ago by wu and bradley @xcite via real - space renormalisation , which predicted a tetra - critical point separating the isat and isaw collapse points .",
    "in contrast , we find that there is likely to be the isat collapsed point itself , that separates a line of first - order transitions from isaw - like weaker @xmath2-point type transitions .    in section 2",
    "we define more precisely the isaw , isat , and innsat models , while in section 3 we define the model introduced by wu and bradley . in section 4",
    ", we present the results of our simulational studies and deduce a conjectured phase diagram .",
    "we end by summarising our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "let us recall briefly the definition and main properties of the isaw model .",
    "consider the ensemble @xmath6 of self - avoiding walks ( saw ) of length @xmath3 , that is , of all lattice paths of @xmath3 steps that can be formed on the square lattice such that they never visit the same site more than once .",
    "given a saw @xmath7 , we define a _ contact _ whenever there is a pair of sites that are neighbours on the lattice but not consecutive on the walk .",
    "we associate an energy @xmath8 with each contact . denoting by @xmath9 the number of contacts in @xmath10 , the probability of @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 and the partition function @xmath12",
    "is defined in the usual way as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inverse temperature @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "we define a boltzmann weight ( fugacity ) @xmath17 .",
    "the finite - length reduced free energy is @xmath18 and the thermodynamic limit is obtained by taking the limit of large @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath19 as mentioned above , it is expected that there is a collapse phase transition at a temperature @xmath20 @xcite , which is known as the @xmath2-point , characterised by a non - analyticity in @xmath21 .",
    "the temperature @xmath22 also separates regions of different finite - length scaling behaviour for fixed temperatures . considering this finite - length scaling , for high temperatures ( @xmath23 ) the excluded volume interaction is the dominant effect , and the behaviour is universally the same as for the non - interacting saw problem : for large @xmath3 , the mean squared end - to - end distance ( or equivalently the radius of gyration ) @xmath24 and partition function @xmath25 are expected to scale as @xmath26 respectively , where the exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 are expected to be universal .",
    "the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are temperature dependent and the _ connective constant _",
    "@xmath31 is related to the free energy ; indeed from [ eq : free - energy-1,eq : free - energy-2 ] we have @xmath32 .",
    "the two - dimensional case has been extensively studied by coulomb - gas techniques and conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "it is well established that the universal exponents are those of the dilute polymer universality class @xcite , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for @xmath35 , and those predicted by duplantier and saleur @xcite , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for @xmath38    for low temperatures ( @xmath39 ) it is accepted that the partition function is dominated by globular configurations that are internally dense , though not necessarily fully dense .",
    "the partition function should then scale differently from that at high temperatures and one expects a large-@xmath3 asymptotics of the form @xmath40 where the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are again temperature dependent .",
    "the factor @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) takes into account the surface contribution to the free energy @xcite .",
    "indeed @xmath43 is the average number of steps on the boundary of the globule ( with the boundary having fractal dimension equal to 1 ) .",
    "it is expected that the internal density smoothly goes to zero as the temperature is raised to the @xmath2-point",
    ". collapsed polymers in two dimensions are expected to fall in the universality class of dense polymers @xcite although numerical simulations have excluded the predicted value 97/46 for exponent @xmath28 @xcite .    to explore the singularity in the free energy at the collapse point further , it is useful to consider the ( reduced ) internal energy and the specific heat , which are defined as @xmath44 with limits @xmath45 when @xmath46 , the singular part of the specific heat behaves as @xmath47 where @xmath48 for a second - order phase transition . if the transition is second - order , the singular part of the thermodynamic limit internal energy behaves as @xmath49 when @xmath46 , and there is a jump in the internal energy at @xmath22 if the transition is first - order ( an effective value of @xmath50 ) .",
    "tri - critical scaling @xcite predicts that around the critical temperature , the finite - length scaling of the singular part of the specific - heat @xmath51 obeys the following crossover scaling form @xmath52 when @xmath46 and @xmath53 , and that the exponents @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related via @xmath56 if one considers the peak of the finite - length specific heat it will behave as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the location of the maximum of the function @xmath59 .",
    "the predicted exponents for the @xmath2-point collapse @xcite are @xmath60 it is important to observe that this implies that the specific heat does not diverge at the transition since the exponent @xmath61 is negative .",
    "however , the peak values of the third derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature will diverge with positive exponent @xmath62      the model of interacting trails on the square lattice is defined as follows .",
    "consider the ensemble @xmath63 of self - avoiding trails ( sat ) of length @xmath3 , that is , of all lattice paths of @xmath3 steps that can be formed on the square lattice such that they never visit the same bond more than once .",
    "note that @xmath64 . given a sat @xmath65",
    ", we associate an energy @xmath66 with each doubly visited site . denoting by @xmath67 the number of doubly visited sites in @xmath68 , the probability of @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 where we define the boltzmann weight @xmath70 and the partition function of the isat model",
    "is given by @xmath71 previous work @xcite on the square lattice has shown that there is a collapse transition at a temperature @xmath72 with a strongly divergent specific heat , and the exponents have been estimated as @xmath73 arising from a scaling of the peak value of the specific heat diverging with exponent @xmath74 this result is a clear difference to the isaw @xmath2-point described above where the singularity in the specific heat is _",
    "convergent_. additionally , at @xmath72 the finite - length scaling of the end - to - end distance was found to be consistent @xcite with the form @xmath75 as @xmath53 .",
    "again , this is quite different to the exponent @xmath76 for the isaw .",
    "another important difference that has been recently observed @xcite is that the low temperature phase is maximally dense . on the square lattice",
    "this implies that if one considers the proportion of the sites on the trail that are at lattice sites which are not doubly occupied via @xmath77 then it is expected that @xmath78 very recently the isat model has been studied in the context of a loop model with crossings @xcite , where it has been suggested that the isat @xmath2-point is an infinite - order multi - critical point described by the @xmath79 sigma model studied in @xcite .",
    "the nearest - neighbour interacting self - avoiding walks ( innsat ) is a third model , recently studied in @xcite , specifically crafted to mix features of the isaw and isat models .",
    "the model is defined as follows : consider the set of bond - avoiding paths @xmath63 as defined in the previous section .",
    "when two sites are adjacent on the lattice but not consecutive along the walk , so as not to be joined by _ any _ step of the walk , we again refer to this pair of sites as a nearest - neighbour _ contact _ and we give it a weight @xmath80 , analogously to the isaw model . denoting by @xmath81 the number of contacts in @xmath68 , the probability of @xmath68 is given by @xmath82 where the partition function is @xmath83 the intensive reduced internal energy and specific heat are as for isaw : @xmath84 we shall also consider the proportion of the sites on the trail that are at lattice sites which are not doubly occupied via the quantity @xmath85 defined in",
    ".    one would think that the presence of crossings would affect the universality class of the collapse transition ( e.g. as portrayed in @xcite ) but in @xcite it was shown that the innsat model has a collapse transition in the same universality class as isaw , that is the @xmath2-point .",
    "( as there are @xmath86 nearest - neighbour contacts illustrated via zigzag ( red ) lines ) and @xmath87 ( as there are 2 doubly - visited sites ) .",
    "the trail can visit a site of the lattice twice by  touching \" and by  crossing \" itself .",
    "note that there is no contact between the second and the seventh visited site of the walk , even though these are non - consecutive nearest - neighbour sites , as both sites are visited consecutively by a different segment of the trail . ]",
    "a model of isat with nearest - neighbour interaction can be defined as follows .",
    "consider the set of bond - avoiding paths @xmath63 as defined in the previous section . given a sat @xmath65 , we associate an energy @xmath66 every time the path visits the same site more than once , as in isat . additionally , we define a _ contact _ whenever there is a pair of sites that are neighbours on the lattice but not consecutive on the walk .",
    "we associate an energy @xmath8 with each contact .    for each configuration",
    "@xmath65 we count the number @xmath67 of doubly - visited sites and @xmath81 of contacts : see figure  [ fig : configuration ] .",
    "hence we associate with each configuration a boltzmann weight @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath14 is the inverse temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by @xmath91 the probability of a configuration @xmath68 is then @xmath92 the average of any quantity @xmath93 over the ensemble set of paths @xmath63 is given generically by @xmath94 in particular , we can define the average number of doubly - visited sites per site and their respective fluctuations as @xmath95 one can also consider the average number of contacts of the trail and their fluctuations @xmath96 this model interpolates between three previously - studied models ; when we set @xmath97 the model reduces to the isat model .",
    "if otherwise we set @xmath98 doubly visited sites are excluded and the model reduces to the isaw model .",
    "finally if we set @xmath99 it becomes the innsat model studied in @xcite .",
    "we began by simulating the full two parameter space by using the flatperm algorithm @xcite .",
    "flatperm outputs an estimate @xmath100 of the total weight of the walks of length @xmath3 at fixed values of some vector of quantities @xmath101 . from the total weight one can access physical quantities over a broad range of temperatures through a simple weighted average , e.g. @xmath102 the quantities @xmath103 may be any subset of the physical parameters of the model . to study the full two parameter phase space we set @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we have first simulated the model using the full two - parameter flatperm algorithm up to length @xmath106 , running @xmath107 iterations , and collecting @xmath108 samples at the maximum length . to obtain a landscape of possible phase transitions , we plot the largest eigenvalue of the matrix of second derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( measuring the strength of the fluctuations and covariance in @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) at length @xmath113 on the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : eigenvalue_plot ] .     of the matrix of second derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath109 and @xmath110 at length 256 .",

    "we remind that the phase transition for @xmath116 is a strong second - order phase transition where the specific heat diverges with an exponent @xmath117 . for @xmath118 , there exists a line of even stronger peaks that join with the peak at @xmath116 , from which one can infer that there exists a strong phase transition on varying @xmath109 for each @xmath118 .",
    "this is borne out by finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "specifically , we have studied the model when @xmath119 : for this value of @xmath110 we have simulated the model using a one - parameter flatperm algorithm up to length @xmath120 , running @xmath121 iterations , and collecting @xmath122 samples at the maximum length .",
    "we find that the specific heat divergence is commensurate with a first - order transition with a linear divergence . to test this assumption of a first - order transition",
    ", we consider the distribution of the number of contacts for various values of @xmath109 near the peak of the specific heat .",
    "figure [ fig : double_peaks ] shows a clear bimodal distribution , confirming the first - order character of the transition .     at fixed @xmath123 . ]",
    "it is hence likely that there exists a line of first - order phase transitions at values of @xmath109 near @xmath86 for each value of @xmath124 .",
    "we will return to the question of whether the line of first - order transitions extends all the way to @xmath116 below .",
    "returning to our two - parameter data , let us first note that when @xmath125 our model is the isaw model and hence there is a weak @xmath2-like transition at @xmath126 @xcite , which is reflected in the density plot by a broad peak near @xmath127 on varying @xmath110 when @xmath125 .",
    "a line of such weak peaks extends to larger values of @xmath109 . when @xmath128 , the model becomes the previously studied innsat @xcite , which also demonstrated a weak @xmath2-like transition with exponent estimates encompassing isaw values .",
    "we thus conjecture that the entire line lies in the @xmath2-universality class .",
    "now if the suggestion that the isat collapse corresponds to an infinite order multi - critical point @xcite is correct , it is then natural and simplest to conjecture that the line of first - order transitions meets with the line of @xmath2-like transitions at that point .",
    "we obtain an indication of where the two lines might join by considering the ratio between the two eigenvalues of the covariance matrix .",
    "this is based on the idea that the two transitions are driven by the two different types of interaction .",
    "when the two eigenvalues coincide is then argued to indicate the presence of a higher order critical point .",
    "the density plot of the eigenvalue ratio is shown on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : eigenvalue_plot ] .",
    "one clearly observes a unique point close to the isat collapse point , where the two eigenvalues have the same magnitude .",
    "considering again the density plot of the largest eigenvalue , the line of peaks that is associated with first - order transitions for @xmath129 and that meets the isat critical point for @xmath130 extends to higher values of @xmath110 .",
    "this implies some type of phase transition at low temperatures . to understand what this transition might be",
    ", we now consider the low temperature phases for fixed values of @xmath110 and @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath116 , an analysis of the isat model has previously shown that the low temperature phase is _ maximally dense _ with the proportion @xmath85 of sites on the trail that are not doubly occupied going to zero in the thermodynamic limit of infinite length @xcite . here we plot the same quantity for various temperatures when @xmath131 in figure  [ fig : low - temperature ] .    ,",
    "the proportion of steps that visit singly - occupied sites at fixed @xmath119 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 ( from top to bottom ) , versus @xmath136 .",
    "the scale @xmath137 is the natural scale for the border of a dense configuration . ]    at low values of @xmath109 the quantity @xmath85 converges to a non - zero value while for larger values @xmath85 seems to converge to zero within error , with a transition visible around @xmath138 .",
    "to illustrate the nature of the polymer around the transition , we present some typical configurations with specified numbers of contacts that have been generated in a simulation at @xmath119 .",
    "these can be seen in figure  [ fig : configs ] .",
    "not only do these configurations illustrate the nature of the low - temperature phase where the number of contacts is large ( see the configuration with @xmath139 ) , but they also clearly demonstrate the first - order nature of the collapse , as we observe co - existence of fully dense and swollen parts of the polymer for smaller values of @xmath111 .",
    "now let us consider low temperatures for fixed values of @xmath109 . in our previous work on innsat @xcite , when @xmath128 the quantity @xmath85 was seen to converge to a non - zero value regardless of temperature",
    ": see figure  7 in @xcite .",
    "this phase is unambiguously of a different nature as that for large @xmath109 at fixed @xmath110 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the line of peaks for large values of @xmath110 and @xmath109 in the largest eigenvalue plot is associated with a transition between these two low temperature phases : one being maximally dense and the other not .",
    "we have not investigated this transition here but an analysis of a transition between similar phases @xcite leads us to conjecture that it is second order .    the entire phase diagram in the @xmath140-quadrant",
    "is therefore split into three phases we already know : the swollen high - temperature phase in the lower - left corner , a low - temperature globular phase of the isaw model on the right ( as determined in @xcite ) , and the low - temperature maximally dense phase of the isat model in the top left .",
    "we then have two critical lines and one first order line joining together at the multi - critical point located at @xmath115 that separates these phases .",
    "putting all this information together gives us the conjectured phase diagram in figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] .    .",
    "the red square and the green circle correspond respectively to the isat collapse point and the isaw @xmath2-point . ]",
    "we investigated a two - parameter model of polymer collapse that has competing interactions , first studied by wu and bradley @xcite , and contains three previously investigated models of polymer collapse , namely isat , isaw and innsat , as specialisations .",
    "we find that the phase diagram for the wu - bradley model contains three phases : a swollen phase and two collapsed phases , one of which is maximally dense .",
    "the corresponding three phase boundaries , two of which are second order and one of which is first - order , meet seemingly at the collapse point of the isat model , and is in agreement with the suggestion in @xcite that the isat transition is an infinite - order multi - critical point .",
    "the second - order phase transition line between the swollen and not maximally dense collapsed phase contains the transitions in the isaw and innsat models , which we conjecture to be a line of @xmath2-like transitions .",
    "the existence of the maximally dense phase is believed to be related to the @xmath141 goldstone phase @xcite .",
    "it is an open question why there exist two different low - temperature regions , as the presence of crossings is supposed to lead to the same goldstone phase @xcite .",
