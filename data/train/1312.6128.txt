    "the gs95 model predicts a kolmogorov spectrum ( @xmath5 ) and scale - dependent anisotropy ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are wave - numbers along and perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field directions , respectively , and @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath3 goes to infinity and/or @xmath4 goes to zero , alfvn speed approaches the speed of light and a new regime of turbulence emerges .",
    "more precisely , when the magnetic energy density is so large that the inertia of the charge carriers can be neglected , the medium can be described by relativistic force - free mhd equations @xcite .",
    "cho ( 2005 ) numerically studied three - dimensional mhd turbulence in this extreme relativistic limit and found the following results .",
    "first , the energy spectrum is consistent with a kolmogorov spectrum : @xmath5 .",
    "second , turbulence shows the goldreich - sridhar type anisotropy : @xmath6 .",
    "these scaling relations are in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions by thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) .",
    "the similarity between non - relativistic alfvnic mhd turbulence and relativistic force - free mhd turbulence leads us to the question : to what extent are relativistic and non - relativistic alfvnic turbulence similar ? in this paper , we try to answer this question .",
    "strong imbalanced alfvnic turbulence is an ideal problem for that purpose because interactions between eddies are very complicated in strong imbalanced alfvnic turbulence . in imbalanced alfvnic turbulence ,",
    "the waves traveling in one direction ( dominant waves ) have higher amplitudes than the opposite - traveling waves ( sub - dominant waves ) . by ` strong ' imbalanced turbulence ,",
    "we mean the dominant waves satisfy the condition of critical balance , @xmath10 , at the energy injection scale , where @xmath11 is the strength of the fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "many studies exist for strong imbalanced alfvnic turbulence in the non - relativistic limit @xcite , but no study is available yet for its relativistic counterpart . in this paper , we compare our relativistic simulations with non - relativistic ones .",
    "our study can have many astrophysical implications .",
    "so far , we do not fully understand turbulence processes in extremely relativistic environments , such as black hole / pulsar magnetospheres , or gamma - ray bursts .",
    "if we can verify close similarities between extremely relativistic and newtonian alfvnic turbulence , we can better understand physical processes , e.g.  reconnection , particle acceleration , etc .",
    ", in such media .",
    "we describe the numerical methods in section 2 and we present our results in section 3 . we give discussions and summary in section 4 .",
    "we solve the following system of equations in a periodic box of size @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the electric field , @xmath16 the poynting flux vector , and we use units such that the speed of light and @xmath17 do not appear in the equations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "one can derive this system of equations from @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dual tensor of the electromagnetic field , @xmath20 the fluid four velocity , and @xmath21 the stress - energy tensor of the electromagnetic field @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the metric tensor and @xmath24 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "we ignore the stress - energy tensor of matter .",
    "we use flat geometry and greek indices run from 1 to 4 .",
    "one can obtain the force - free condition from maxwell s equations and the energy - momentum equation @xmath25 . from equation ( [ eq_cond ] ) , one can derive @xmath26 in our simulations , the mhd condition @xmath27 is enforced all the time .",
    "we solve equations ( 1)-(6 ) using a monotone upstream - centered schemes for conservation laws ( muscl ) type scheme with hll fluxes ( harten , lax , van leer 1983 ; in fact , in force - free mhd these fluxes reduce to lax - friedrichs fluxes ) and monotonized central limiter ( see kurganov et al .",
    "the overall scheme is second - order accurate . after updating the system of equations along the @xmath28 direction , we repeat similar procedures for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions with appropriate rotation of indexes .",
    "gammie , mckinney , & tth ( 2003 ) used a similar scheme for general relativistic mhd and del zanna , bucciantini , & londrillo ( 2003 ) used a similar scheme to construct a higher - order scheme for special relativistic mhd .",
    "while the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field , @xmath31 , the electric field has only a fluctuating one .",

    "no fluctuating fields are present .",
    "we isotropically drive turbulence in the wave - number range @xmath33 .",
    "we adjust the amplitude of forcing to maintain @xmath34 after saturation , where the subscript ` + ' denotes dominant waves .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath35 after saturation . since the energy injection rates for the sub - dominant waves ( @xmath36 ) are equal to or less than those of dominant waves ( @xmath37 ) , where @xmath38 s are forcing vectors , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "simulation parameters are listed in table 1 .      to check the stability of our code",
    ", we perform a simulation of relativistic alfvn waves moving in the same direction .",
    "since alfvn waves moving in one direction do not interact each other , their energy spectrum should not change in time .",
    "indeed figure [ fig:1](a ) confirms this : the initial energy spectrum ( the thick solid line ) does not show much change even after t@xmath4163 , which corresponds to @xmath4110 wave crossing times over the box size .",

    "we have @xmath43 at @xmath32 and we drive the medium for @xmath44 . the energy densities of the dominant waves initially rise quickly and reach saturation states .",
    "the values of @xmath45 during saturation in those runs are between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "since we drive turbulence isotropically , critical balance is roughly satisfied . in general , the larger the imbalance , the slower the approach to the saturation state .",
    "the largest imbalanced run ( run 256-r0.33 ) shows very slow approach to the saturation state .",
    "figure [ fig:1](c ) shows time evolution of energy densities of the sub - dominant waves . from top to bottom , the degree of imbalance increases .",
    "the top curve corresponds to the balanced turbulence ( run 256-bal ) and the bottom curve to the largest imbalance ( run 256-r0.33 ) . note that , in run 256-r0.33 , @xmath46 goes up very quickly for @xmath47 and then gradually goes down , which may be due to the increase of @xmath48 .",
    "figures [ fig:1](d ) and ( e ) show time evolution of the ratio @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:1](d ) clearly shows that the value of @xmath49 increases substantially as the degree of imbalance increases . for @xmath50 , we actually plot @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "since different theories on imbalanced non - relativistic alfvnic turbulence predict different relations between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , it will be useful to plot the relation for our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig:1](f ) shows the relation between the two ratios . roughly speaking",
    ", the ratio @xmath49 exhibits a power - law dependence on the ratio @xmath53 : @xmath0 with @xmath1 .    in figure [ fig:1 ] ,",
    "all simulations are performed on a grid of @xmath54 points .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:2 ] , which compares results of runs 512-r0.33 and 512-r0.33 , implies that numerical resolution of @xmath54 would be enough for our current study .",
    "note that two runs have identical numerical set - ups except the numerical resolution ( @xmath54 versus @xmath55 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath45 ( upper curves ) almost coincide , but the value of @xmath46 for @xmath55 is slightly higher than that for @xmath54 ( see lower curves ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig:2 ] shows energy spectra for run 512-r0.33 .",
    "although we have only about 1 decade of inertial range , we can clearly observe that the spectral slopes for dominant and sub - dominant waves are different .",
    "the spectrum of the dominant waves ( upper curve ) is slightly steeper than @xmath56 , while that of the sub - dominant ones ( lower curve ) is a bit shallower than @xmath56 .      in the presence of a strong mean magnetic field , structure of turbulence",
    "tends to elongate along the direction of the mean field .",
    "therefore elongation of structures , or anisotropy , is an important aspect of mhd turbulence . both relativistic force - free and non - relativistic balanced alfvnic turbulence",
    ".    imbalanced non - relativistic alfvnic turbulence is also anisotropic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since interactions between eddies are very complicated in imbalanced alfvnic turbulence , it will be interesting to study anisotropy of imbalanced relativistic force - free mhd turbulence .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the shapes of eddies . in the figure , we plot a contour diagram of the second - order structure function for the magnetic field in a local frame , which is aligned with the local mean magnetic field @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the local mean field @xmath57 , respectively ; see cho & vishniac ( 2000 ) and cho et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the detailed discussion of the local frame .",
    "the left and middle panels of figure [ fig:3 ] show shapes of dominant and sub - dominant eddies , respectively .",
    "we can clearly see that the dominant eddies ( left panel ) are less anisotropic than the sub - dominant ones ( middle panel ) .",
    "if we plot the relation between perpendicular sizes of eddies ( or , y intercepts of the contours ; @xmath62 ) and the parallel ones ( or , x intercepts ; @xmath63 ) , than we can see that the dominant eddies show anisotropy weaker than @xmath64 and the sub - dominant ones show anisotropy stronger than @xmath64 .",
    "our simulations are consistent with the theory and simulations of the imbalanced non - relativistic mhd turbulence ( beresnyak & lazarian 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "indeed , the latter results are consistent with our finding of the relation between the ratio of the energy densities of the sub - dominant and dominant waves , their spectral slopes and their anisotropy .",
    "this is suggestive of a close relation between the non - relativistic and relativistic turbulence and implies that the existing theories of non - relativistic turbulence , e.g.  theories for magnetic reconnection , particle acceleration , etc .",
    ", can be generalized for the relativistic limit .",
    "this has not yet been done and , naturally , more theoretical / numerical research , especially with high numerical resolutions , for the relativistic case is necessary .",
    "imbalanced turbulence is a generic incarnation of turbulence in the presence of sources and sinks of turbulent energy .",
    "we know from the studies of non - relativistic imbalanced turbulence that its slower decay compared to the balanced one allows the energy transfer over larger distances and its transfer to the balanced one due to parametric instabilities or the reflection of waves from density inhomogeneities can result in local deposition of energy and momentum which provide many astrophysically important consequences .",
    "the properties of imbalanced relativistic turbulence are important for many astrophysical settings including the magnetosphere of pulsars , environments of gamma ray bursts and relativistic jets .      1 .",
    "the magnetic spectrum of dominant waves is steeper than that of sub - dominant waves . 2 .",
    "the dominant waves show anisotropy weaker than and the sub - dominant waves show anisotropy stronger than @xmath64 .",
    "the energy density ratio @xmath49 is roughly proportional to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 s are energy injection rates and @xmath1 .",
    "all these results are consistent with the theory and simulations in beresnyak & lazarian @xcite",
    ". therefore we can conclude that relativistic force - free mhd turbulence is indeed very similar to its non - relativistic counterpart .",
    "our results imply that many results in non - relativistic alfvnic turbulence can be carried over to relativistic force - free mhd turbulence .",
    "for example , theories on magnetic reconnection ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , particle acceleration ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and thermal diffusion ( e.g. ,  cho et al .",
    "2003 ) obtained in non - relativistic alfvnic turbulence can also be applicable to relativistic force - free mhd turbulence .",
    "the close similarity between the properties of non - relativistic and relativistic imbalanced turbulence found in this paper elucidates the nature of magnetic turbulence that preserves its properties in both regimes irrespectively of whether turbulence is balanced or imbalanced . from the practical point of numerical studies ,",
