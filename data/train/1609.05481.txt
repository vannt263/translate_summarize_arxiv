    "the radiative properties of emitters ( e.g. atoms or quantum dots ) located inside a dielectric or conducting material can be significantly modified compared to those in vacuum .",
    "the modification results from the variation of the density of modes of the em field which can be adjusted by changing the geometric shape or space period structure of a material  @xcite .",
    "the radiative properties of emitters can also be modified by locating the atoms close to the surface of a dielectric or conducting material  @xcite . in this case , the modification results from the presence of surface em modes known as plasmon guided ( pg ) field  @xcite . a new category of materials has been proposed , so - called meta - materials  @xcite , characterized by specifically designed geometrical structures which drastically modify the density of the em modes , so the field propagation , also yielding to the pg field  @xcite .",
    "owing to the high local density of modes , emitters may interact strongly with the surface field which affects their radiative properties  @xcite .",
    "for example , when quantum dots are placed at a distance about several tens of nanometers above two dimensional metal surface , strong coupling could be generated between the quantum dots and the collective mode reflected in the presence of the rabi oscillations  @xcite . in the structure",
    "composed of zero index and left hand materials , maximum quantum interference and a suppression of the atomic decay rate can be achieved between zeeman levels due to the anisotropy of the em modes  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that by changing the strength of the driving field and adjusting position of the quantum dot , the plasma mode on the surface of a metal - nanoparticles material can introduce asymmetrical features into the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the study of entanglement between distant atoms and controlled the transmission of information between them are vital to the development of quantum information technology  @xcite . a key model to investigate the creation and storage processes of entanglement often follows with a system composed of two - level quantum emitters  @xcite .",
    "when atoms coupled to the same pg field , the incoherent spontaneous exchange of photons could occur and results in collective damping  @xcite .",
    "it has been revealed when the decay through one of the collective states is deeply depressed , long lived entanglement of the system could be achieved , which only depends on the distance between atoms  @xcite . by applying nanowire structure ,",
    "the pg field could be well guided and thus entanglement between quantum dots still exists at several vacuum wave lengths  @xcite .",

    "@xcite have shown that the entanglement between two atoms can exist over distances much larger than the resonant wavelength if the space between the atoms is filled with a thin membrane made of single negative ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) and left hand materials .",
    "however , most of the studies are focus on metal - dielectric structure , and the entanglement only maintains for a small time scale .",
    "corresponding similarities should also then be expected in the dynamics of atoms located close to the interface between two meta - materials . in this paper , we present an analytical treatment of the dynamics of two independent atoms located close to the interface of two meta - materials , one of a negative permeability ( mn ) and the other of a negative permittivity ( en ) .",

    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) , nonradiative electromagnetic excitations associated with charge density waves propagating along the interface are generated .",
    "the spp propagate in the @xmath2- and @xmath3-directions along the interface between the meta - materials , and rapidly decay in the @xmath4-direction . as illustrated in figure",

    "in other words , the polarization of the atomic dipole moments determines the direction of propagation of the spp on the interface .",
    "hence , the interface would behave as a directional guiding plasma field mode propagating in the @xmath2-direction , formally analogy of a plasmonic waveguide  @xcite .",

    "each atom excites the spp propagating along the interface .",
    "the excitation size of the spp depends on the distance of the atom from the interface and polarization of its dipole moment .",
    "as illustrated by green and purple ellipses , the excitation area of the surface plasmon polaritons decreases with an decreasing distance @xmath7 and their shapes extend more in the @xmath2 direction than in the @xmath3 direction if the atomic dipole moments are polarized in the @xmath5 plane.,width=321 ]    the mathematical approach we adopt here is based on the green s function method  @xcite .",
    "our focus is on how the plasma field induced at the interface between the materials changes the dynamics of the atoms , in particular , the population transfer and entanglement .",
    "the remarkably simple analytical expressions are derived for the probability amplitudes valid for an arbitrary initial state , arbitrary strengths of the coupling constants of the atoms to the plasma field , and arbitrary distances between the atoms .",
    "we find a number of interesting general results .",
    "in the first place , we distinguish two different time scales of the evolution of the atomic states , one corresponding to the evolution of the collective symmetric state and the other to the antisymmetric state . secondly , we find a threshold behavior of the coupling constants which separate the non - markovian behavior of the system from the markovian one  @xcite .",
    "the markovian evolution is usually attributed to a weak coupling of an atom to the field .",
    "we show that the collective effects may result in the markovian evolution even in the limit of a strong coupling of the atoms to the field .",
    "inversely , a non - markovian evolution can be seen even in the regime of a weak coupling .",
    "thirdly , we find that the plasma field does not appear as a common reservoir to the atoms . in order to explain the behavior of the atoms we adopt the image method and",
    "show that the dynamics of the two atoms are completely equivalent to those of a four - atom system .",
    "finally , we consider the case in which the plasma field frequency is off - resonant with the atoms and find that in this case the dynamics resemble those of two atoms coupled to a common reservoir .",
    "the atoms interact through the exchange of virtual photons resulting in the absence of the images .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the model and present the explicit analytic expressions for the time dependence of the probability amplitudes of the atoms .",
    "detailed dynamics of the atoms are studied in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we assume that a single excitation is present initially in the system and demonstrate how the evolution of the system can be simply understood in terms of the evolution of the atoms and their corresponding images .",
    "we then demonstrate in section  [ sec4 ] the collective behavior of the atoms in both markovian and non - markovian regimes of the evolution .",
    "entangled properties of the atoms are discussed in section  [ sec5 ] , where we calculate the concurrence for different initial states and different coupling strengths of the atoms to the plasma field .",
    "the effect of an off - resonant coupling of the atoms to the plasma field on the collective dynamics and entanglement is discussed in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "the paper concludes with two appendices in which we give details of the derivation of the integro - differential equations for the probability amplitudes and the calculations of the integral kernels .",
    "both longitudinal and transverse parts of the green function are considered in the evaluation of the kernels .",
    "perfectly conducting materials are known to generate a strong pg field which is refined in a short regime near the surface  @xcite .",
    "a plasma field can also be generated at the surface of a meta - material with either negative permittivity ( @xmath0 ) or negative permeability ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "this means that a large density of the modes exists at the interface between the two perfectly paired negative meta - material slabs , and can be treated as optical topological material  @xcite .",
