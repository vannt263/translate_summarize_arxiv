    "observations with the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite have allowed for the first time the detection of the @xmath0 transition of hydrogen fluoride ( hf ) at 1.232  thz in the local universe , and revealed the ubiquitous nature of this molecule in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way .",
    "indeed , hf has proven to be a good tracer of molecular gas in the ism , being detected in environments as diverse as orion  kl , omc-1 @xcite , as well as diffuse clouds on the lines - of - sight toward w49n , w51 @xcite , w31c @xcite and sagittarius b2(m ) @xcite and in two nearby active galaxies , mrk 231 @xcite and arp220 @xcite .",
    "this transition is generally observed in absorption , as expected , due to its very large a  coefficient , a@xmath10 = 2.42 @xmath3 10@xmath11  s@xmath12 .",
    "only an extremely dense region , with a strong radiation field , could generate enough excitation to yield an hf feature in emission @xcite .",
    "we expect the hf to be the main reservoir of fluorine in the interstellar medium ( ism ) because of its unique thermochemistry .",
    "fluorine reacts exothermically with molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath9 ) to create a diatomic hydride molecule hf , forming a strong bond , only destroyed very slowly by means of photodissociation and as a result of reactions with ions of low abundances such as he@xmath13 , h@xmath14 , and c@xmath13 .",
    "hf absorption thus traces the total molecular column density along the line - of - sight , including very low column density or cold regions that may not be detectable in co emission or other commonly used tracers of molecular hydrogen .",
    "indeed , hf observations of galactic sources have revealed absorption components that had previously been undetected in observations of any other molecules ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ? * ) .    following - up on the herschel discovery of the ubiquitous nature of hf , @xcite searched for hf toward the ultra - luminous lensed starburst galaxy apm 08279 + 5255 at z=3.911 .",
    "their results led to the fortuitous detection of water at the highest - redshift to date , but a non - detection of the hf @xmath0 absorption feature , which may be related to the specific face - on geometry of this source .",
    "because of its strong submillimeter continuum , the cloverleaf galaxy at z = 2.558 is another interesting high - redshift candidate in which to search for hf .",
    "the cloverleaf , h1413 + 117 ( 14@xmath1515@xmath1646@xmath17.23 11@xmath1829@xmath1944@xmath20.0 , j2000.0 ) , a broad absorption line ( bal ) quasi - stellar object ( qso ) , is among the most luminous galaxies yet detected in the universe @xcite .",
    "it was identified as a lensed object with four bright image components with angular separation from 0.77@xmath20 to 1.36@xmath20 @xcite . @xcite",
    "derived a lens model for the cloverleaf using co @xmath21 data obtained from the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "their model suggests that the co emission originates from a region of @xmath1 800  pc .",
    "the large size of the co source suggests that the cloverleaf is a composite object , with a central powerful active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and an extended starburst region similar to the nearby ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "the large luminosity , the substantial lense magnification and the composite nature of this object make the cloverleaf a good candidate to perform absorption line studies toward the agn , providing an excellent laboratory for studying gas evolution with redshift in galaxies .    we have searched for the hf @xmath0 transition , redshifted to 346 ghz , in the cloverleaf using the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "these observations are described in section 2 below .",
    "our results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the detection of hydrogen fluoride reported here marks the first discovery of this molecule at a redshift z @xmath8 0.042 .",
    "we have used the 10.4 m cso telescope to observe the @xmath0 transition of hf , with rest frequency of 1232.4762  ghz @xcite , toward the cloverleaf quasar .",
    "the observations were carried out during two independent observing runs in march and june 2011 , using the 345 ghz wideband receiver with single sideband ( ssb ) system noise temperatures from 300 to 600  k. the receiver was tuned to the hf line , redshifted to the frequency of 346.396 ghz .",
    "the antenna full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beam size at this frequency is about 21@xmath20 , with a beam efficiency 0.75 .",
    "pointing was checked regularly on planets and bright co stars with typical pointing errors less than 5@xmath20 during one night .",
    "we used the 1 ghz bandwidth fast fourier transform spectrometer ( ffts ) back - end with 8192 channels and the 1 ghz bandwidth acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) with 2048 channels .",
    "the average spectra obtained with the low- and high - resolution backends after an on - source integration time of @xmath1 4 hours show an absorption feature ( figure 1 ) with an integrated absorption strengths of 0.194 @xmath22 0.034 and 0.202 @xmath22 0.034",
    "k km / s , respectively , corresponding to detections at the 5.7 and 5.9 sigma levels .",
    "the march and june data sets and the two backends are entirely consistent , each data set giving a statistically significant detection ( following the conventional detection criterion : signal - to - noise ratio @xmath8 3 ) .    whereas the absorption depth is the same for both spectrometers , the continuum level is different , due to backend related instabilities .",
    "assuming a high optical depth ( i.e. saturated absorption ) , a good approximation given that the hf optical depths are typically larger than those of other submillimeter transitions , such as h@xmath9o and ch , we estimate the ssb continuum level to be equal to the absorption depth and obtain an upper limit to the continuum level of 3.5 @xmath22 1 mk which corresponds to 114 @xmath22 33 mjy ( using a conversion jansky to kelvin of s / t@xmath23 @xmath24 32.5 j@xmath25/k ) .",
    "this value , within the uncertainties , agrees with the @xmath1  70 mjy value obtained by extrapolating to the observed frequency the best - fit continuum of @xcite .    for data reduction and analysis ,",
    "the iram gildas package was used .",
    "individual spectra were averaged by weighting by the noise in each spectrum . the final r.m.s . in both backends",
    "is consistent and has a value of 0.99 mk over 20 km s@xmath12 .",
    "figure 2 shows the average spectrum obtained with the high resolution ffts backend , smoothed to a 20 km s@xmath12 resolution , with a linear baseline subtracted . we apply a gaussian fit to the observed spectrum to calculate the significance of the detected line .",
    "we obtain an absorption - line equivalent width of 55 km s@xmath12 , a peak intensity of -4.1 mk and a central velocity of -113 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the velocity shift is well within the width of the observed co line profiles @xcite .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is only twice our velocity resolution , therefore we can not exclude the possibility that the line could have partially unresolved substructures .",
    "@xcite found from their hco@xmath13 ( @xmath26 ) excitation modeling that the dense gas excitation in the cloverleaf is consistent with being purely collisional , rather than being enhanced by radiative processes , as suggested for similar sources like apm 08279 + 5255 ( z = 3.91 ) where high-@xmath27 hcn transitions are substantially enhanced by radiative excitation through pumping of mid - infrared rovibrational lines @xcite .",
    "the strong radiation field could have led to photodissociation of hf and explain its low abundance in this source @xcite .",
    "therefore , due to its large spontaneous emission coefficient ( 2.42 @xmath3 10@xmath11 s@xmath12 ) and low rates of collisional excitation , we expect that most hf molecules toward the cloverleaf will be in the ground rotational state . in that case",
    ", we can estimate a lower limit for the total hf column density by use of the following expression : @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the line fwhm , @xmath30 is the wavelength of the observed transition , @xmath31 is the einstein coefficient , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the degeneracy of the lower and upper levels and @xmath34 is the optical depth . following the assumption of saturated absorption we use a @xmath34 greater than 3 for our lower limit calculations .",
    "we obtain a conservative lower limit on the total hf column density of @xmath1 4 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the mechanism of fluorine nucleosynthesis still remains highly debated . to date , three different possible scenarios for the nucleosynthesis of fluorine have been proposed : neutrino capture by @xmath35ne in type ii supernovae proposed by @xcite , production in agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "however , the relative importance of these various processes remains unclear .",
    "our detection of hydrogen fluoride towards the cloverleaf quasar at z  =  2.558 represents the _ earliest _ fluorine ever detected ( just 2.6 gyr after the big bang assuming h@xmath36  =  71 km / s , @xmath37  =  0.73 , @xmath38@xmath39  =  0.27 ) , and argues for significant production in high mass stars ( i.e. wolf - rayet stars or supernovae ) .    from a chemical analysis of fluorine - containing molecules in the interstellar medium",
    ", @xcite predicted that over a wide range of conditions the hf and h@xmath9 column densities would track each other closely with the ratio of n(hf)/n(h@xmath9 ) equal to the gas - phase elemental abundance of f relative to h nuclei ( equal to @xmath1 3.6 @xmath3 10@xmath40 in diffuse atomic clouds in the solar neighborhood ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "herschel observations of hf @xmath0 toward a diverse galactic environments proved that hf is an excellent probe of h@xmath9 in diffuse clouds , although the derived abundances , with an average ratio of n(hf)/n(h@xmath9)= 1.44 @xmath22 0.35 @xmath3 10@xmath40 , are a factor of two below the chemical model predictions @xcite .",
    "lower values of hf abundances have been obtained toward denser regions due to freeze out of hf onto dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* observed hf abundances as low as 5 @xmath3 10@xmath41 in the denser parts of ngc6334 i ) .",
    "our first detection of hf absorption line toward a high - redshift source shows that the hf line is also an extremely sensitive tool to trace molecular material toward high - redshift objects . from the hf absorption line observed toward the cloverleaf we place a lower limit of 4 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 on the hf column density .",
    "@xcite used the observed strength of the co @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 lines and the disk model from @xcite to derive a total gas column density of the order of n@xmath7 @xmath1 4.6 @xmath3 10@xmath45 @xmath5 over the projected disk . since the hf line is seen in absorption , the relevant h@xmath9 column density , for the hf abundance calculation ,",
    "is that in front of the continuum source , which should be @xmath11/2 of the total hydrogen column density .",
    "thus , we obtain a conservative lower limit of the hf abundance of @xmath8 1.7 @xmath3 10@xmath6 .",
    "our observations suggest that , assuming a galactic n(hf)/n@xmath7 ratio , hf accounts for at least @xmath110% of the fluorine in the gas phase along the line of sight to the cloverleaf quasar .    the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 shows an absorbing component shifted from the source systemic velocity by @xmath1 - 113 km s@xmath12 . the co @xmath21 line from @xcite ( their figure 2 ) , shows a marked asymmetry , with a steep rise on its blue side ( -225 to -25 km s@xmath12 ) and a slower decrease on its red side ( 25 to 225 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the co emission in the cloverleaf originates in a disk- or ring - like structure .",
    "the absorbing component in our hf spectrum coincides in the velocity frame with excess emission ( with respect to a standard gaussian ) on the blue side of the co @xmath21 line . from the blue bump appearing on the co @xmath21 and the velocity shifted hf line profile",
    ", we expect that the blue - shifted part of the co and hf line arises from a region of the molecular torus which is positioned closer to the caustic of the lens .",
    "future higher - sensitivity observations with alma are needed to establish the velocity distribution of hf and spatially resolve the four lensed lobes of the source .",
