    "recall that a cubic form is said to be degenerate if the corresponding cubic hypersurface is a cone .",
    "fowler @xcite has shown that any non - degenerate cubic form that represents @xmath36 automatically captures @xmath35 provided only that @xmath37 . hence it suffices to fix attention on those forms that do not represent zero non - trivially .",

    "ours is not the first attempt to better understand the arithmetic of cubic hypersurfaces that split off a form .",
    "indeed , in davenport s @xcite treatment of cubic forms in @xmath51 variables , a fundamental ingredient in the treatment of certain bilinear equations is a separate analysis of those forms that split into two .",

    "in view of the fact that the local conditions are automatically satisfied for cubic forms in at least @xmath56 variables , we observe the following easy consequence .    [ main ] let @xmath11 be a hypersurface defined by a cubic form that splits off a norm form , with @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that theorem [ main ] will play a useful rle in dispatching some of the cases that arise in the proof of theorem [ main ] . following the strategy of birch , davenport and lewis @xcite",
    ", it would however be straightforward to adapt the proof of theorem  [ main ] to retrieve theorem [ main ] .",
    "an obvious further line of enquiry would be to investigate cubic hypersurfaces that split off two forms , by which we mean that the corresponding cubic form can be written as @xmath57 identically in @xmath30 , for appropriate @xmath58 . with the extra structure apparent in such hypersurfaces one would like to determine the most general conditions possible under which the conjectured value of @xmath22 variables suffices to ensure the existence of @xmath2-rational points .",
    "one of the remarkable features of our argument is the breadth of tools that it draws upon .",
    "the underlying machinery is the hardy  littlewood circle method , and we certainly take advantage of many of the contributions to the theory of polynomial cubic exponential sums that have been made during the last fifty years .",
    "these are detailed in ",
    "[ sec : exp_sums ]",
    ". a further component of our work involves a detailed analysis of the case in which one of the forms that splits off in theorem [ main ] is singular and has a relatively small number of variables . to deal with this scenario it pays to reflect upon the classification of singular cubic hypersurfaces",
    "this is a very old topic in algebraic geometry , and can be traced back to the pioneering work of cayley @xcite and schlfli @xcite .",
    "all of the necessary information will be collected together in  [ s : geom ] .",
    "the final ingredient in our work comprises good upper bounds for the number of @xmath2-rational points of bounded height on auxiliary cubic hypersurfaces .",
    "the estimates that we will take advantage of are presented in  [ sec : upper ] .",
    "when it is applicable , the hardy  littlewood circle method allows us to show that @xmath59 for a given cubic hypersurface @xmath60 by evaluating asymptotically the number of @xmath2-rational points of bounded height on @xmath0 .",
    "it is a well - known but intriguing feature of the method that one can achieve such precise information by first establishing weaker upper bounds for the growth rate of @xmath2-rational points on appropriate auxiliary varieties .",
    "in fact , we will show in lemma [ lem:8 ] that the @xmath2-rational points on a non - singular cubic hypersurface @xmath11 satisfy the growth bound @xmath61 for any @xmath62 , provided that @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the usual exponential height function .",
    "this should be compared with the manin conjecture @xcite which predicts that the exponent of @xmath65 should be @xmath66 as soon as @xmath67 .    throughout our",

    "the proof of theorem [ main ] will depend intimately on the dimension of the hypersurfaces defined by the constituent cubic forms , and the nature of their singularities",

    "a crucial step in davenport s @xcite treatment of general cubic forms is a proof of the fact that forms that fail to be good automatically possess non - trivial integer solutions for `` geometric reasons '' .",
