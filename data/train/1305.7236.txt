    "last year s discovery at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a new particle @xmath1  @xcite consistent with the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) marks the start of a long - term experimental program of measurements of higgs properties . through this program",
    "we hope to learn the nature of the particle itself and understand the underlying physics responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "many extensions of the sm contain one or more additional scalar particles that can mix with the sm higgs boson .",
    "such scenarios can be tested experimentally through measurements of the couplings of the discovered higgs boson , which will be modified in general from their expected sm values , as well as through direct searches for the additional scalar particles .",
    "measurements of the couplings of such a mixed higgs provide some information about the degree of mixing between the sm higgs and the additional scalar and the additional scalar s contribution to electroweak symmetry breaking . if the additional scalar couples to charged fermions ( this is possible only for scalars that originate from an su(2 ) doublet ) , coupling measurements will also shed light on the fermion coupling pattern .",
    "information about the electroweak quantum numbers of the additional scalar , however , can not generally be obtained from measurements of the three - point couplings of the discovered higgs boson to pairs of fermions or gauge bosons .",
    "this is easiest to see in the case that the additional scalar does not contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking ( we also assume that it does not couple to fermions ) ; in this case , the couplings of the discovered higgs boson to a pair of sm fermions or gauge bosons are all modified by a common multiplicative factor that depends on the mixing angle between the sm higgs and the additional scalar .",
    "measurements of these couplings provide no information about the electroweak quantum numbers of the additional scalar .",
    "even if the additional scalar does contribute to electroweak symmetry breaking , its electroweak quantum numbers can not generally be disentangled from mixing effects in the three - point couplings of the discovered higgs boson .    in this paper",
    "we propose a strategy to determine the electroweak quantum numbers of the additional scalar by measuring the four - point coupling of a pair of @xmath2 or @xmath3 bosons to a pair of the discovered higgs bosons .",
    "this coupling depends on the weak isospin and hypercharge of the additional scalar and can be accessed experimentally in electroweak - initiated double higgs production .",
    "we consider the processes @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the proposed international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "these processes have previously been studied as a way to measure the higgs self - coupling at the ilc  @xcite .",
    "we show that the four - point @xmath6 coupling and the higgs self - coupling can be simultaneously extracted using measurements of the double higgs production cross section at two different @xmath0 collision energies .",
    "we also suggest a more sophisticated extraction strategy using the dependence of the two higgs invariant mass distribution on the two couplings of interest .",
