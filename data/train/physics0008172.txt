    "major elements of the current r&d activities for the jlc project@xcite includes : development of polarized electron sources@xcite , experimental studies of a damping ring@xcite , development of x - band technologies as the main scheme for the main linacs , and c - band rf development as a backup technology for the main linacs@xcite .",
    "figure[jlc_schematics ] shows a schematic diagram of jlc .",
    "the target center - of - mass energy is 250@xmath0500 gev in phase - i , and @xmath01 tev or higher in phase - ii . since 1998 , through an r&d collaboration ( international study group ",
    "isg ) which was formalized between kek and slac@xcite , development of hardware elements for the x - band main linacs has been pursued based on the basic parameters common to both jlc and nlc@xcite .",
    "tables[x_table_1 ] and [ x_table_2 ] give the most up - to - date basic machine parameters that have been chosen as a result of optimization process in isg discussions .",

    "[ x_table_1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the accelerator test facility ( atf)@xcite at kek ( see figure  [ atfscheme ] ) is a test bed for an upstream portion of jlc , which has to produce a train of ultra - low emittance bunches of electrons ( and positrons ) .",
    "it includes a multi - bunch - capable electron source , a 1.54gev s - band linac , and a 1.54gev damping ring ( dr ) prototype .",
    "a variety of studies were successfully conducted in 1994 through 1996 on acceleration of multi - bunch beam ( up to 12 bunches , 2.8ns bunch separation ) .",
    "the multi - bunch beam loading compensation scheme based on the rf frequency modulation of a small set of accelerating structures was successfully demonstrated .    commissioning work of the atf dr began in early 1997 with many participants from both inside and outside kek .",
    "the accelerator has been operated in a single - bunch mode with the typical stored intensity of @xmath1 electron / bunch or less at a repetition rate up to 1.56 hz . achieved and",
    "design parameters relevant to operation of atf are summarized in table  [ atfparam ] . by summer 1998 , the horizontal beam emittance @xmath2 of @xmath01.4@xmath310@xmath4 m ( i.e. @xmath5 3.5@xmath310@xmath6 m ) was measured by using a group of wire scanners in the beam diagnostics section of the extraction line@xcite .",
    "the most recent set of measured horizontal and vertical emittance values@xcite , as of april , 2000 , are shown in figure  [ dremit ] .",
    "some of the development at atf which are considered to play important roles in the progress of the achieved vertical emittance values are summarized as follows :    * improved resolution ( @xmath020 @xmath7 m ) of single - shot bpm readout electronics . * improved understanding of the first order optics in the dr , and corrections introduced by using `` fudge '' factors for the field strength of quadrupole magnets and quadrupole field components of the combined - function bend magnets in the dr . * improved dispersion and orbit correction algorithm which are tuned to minimize the vertical dispersion ( @xmath0 5 mm ) in the dr without overly upsetting the cod . *",
    "skew quadrupole magnet fields were introduced in the arc sections of the dr by using trim windings of sextupole magnets .",
    "they were used to minimize the cross - plane coupling by using the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling signals in the diagnostics of the first - order optics , as well as by using the tune difference @xmath10-@xmath11 near the coupling resonance . *",
    "improved algorithm for the correction procedure for the vertical dispersion in the extraction line , where the wire scanner beam diagnostics instruments are situated .",
    "this result from atf may be put in perspective as shown in figure  [ emitsummary ] .",
    "it is seen that the beam emittance that is required for typical next - generation linear colliders , including jlc / nlc , is nearly achieved .",
    "however , a number of issues still remain to be investigated at atf .",
    "for instance ,    1 .",
    "the beam emittance values so far considered the most reliable have been obtained by using wire scanners in the extraction line .",
    "these and measurements from synchrotron radiation ( sr ) monitor in the dr , which utilizes the interferometry , are not totally consistent .",
    "this is most likely due to effects of mechanical vibrations of the optical stands that are used for the sr monitor system , but it requires more studies .",
    "2 .   there may be field errors in the magnetic components in the beam extraction line or at the beam extraction point .",
    "they might introduce @xmath8-@xmath9 cross plane coupling and fictitious signals of the growth of the vertical beam emittance , which may not yet be accounted for in wire scanner measurements .",
    "observed growth of vertical emittance or the emittance ratio as shown in figure  [ dremit ] is found to have too strong a dependence on the bunch intensity , compared to existing model calculations of intra - beam scattering effects .",
    "it has not yet been resolved whether this is due to errors in measurements , inadequate set - up assumptions or true beam dynamics effects .",
    "in addition , the reported emittance numbers from atf are so far based only on single - bunch beam operations .",
    "after the summer shutdown period , the beam operation of atf is scheduled to resume in october , 2000 .",
    "preparation is currently under way for addressing the single - bunch emittance issues as well as multi - bunch operation of the atf dr .",
    "development of x - band accelerating structure at kek has been conducted in close collaboration with a group at slac .",
    "the accelerating structure studied is based on the damped - detuned concept  @xcite .",
    "the recent research focus at kek has been on ( i ) fabrication of copper disks for the rdds ( rounded damped - detuned ) structure with a diamond - turning technique with ultra - high precision lathes , and ( ii ) their assembly into structure bodies by means of the diffusion bonding technique@xcite .",
    "they have been pursued in conjunction with development of better control of transverse wakefield and improved rf - to - beam efficiency .",
    "figure  [ rddsdisk ] shows a schematic drawing of the typical copper disk for the rdds structure , whose first prototype ( rdds1 ) was successfully built in 1999 and was tested for wakefield characteristics at the asset facility of slac in 2000 .",
    "the rdds1 ( 1.8 m long ) consists of 206 similar disks , each 61 mm in diameter and 8.737 mm in thickness .    during disk fabrication ,",
    "much attentions have been paid to the temperature control of the lathe , positioning of the diamond cutting tool , and its motion .",
    "the radius of the cutting tool are pre - determined within 0.3 @xmath7 m by machining an aluminum test hemisphere ( @xmath1260 mm ) and by measuring the surface features with a roundness tester .",
    "figure  [ rddscontour ] shows a contour profile plot of a test rdds disk that was measured with a cmm ( coordinate measurement machine ) with contouring capability .",
    "the solid line shows the design shape , while the black dots show the measured shape , with the deviation from the nominal shape magnified by 200 times .",
    "the machined surface matched the design to within @xmath131 @xmath7 m .",
    "other dimensional parameters such as the disk outer diameter , aperture radius @xmath14 , which are determined by the diamond turning , are found to have been done with similar precision .",
    "in addition to mechanical quality control , careful measurements of the fundamental and first - order transverse mode resonant frequencies of cells were performed for individual disks . as an example ,",
    "figure  [ rddsrf ] shows the fundamental - mode frequencies , measured on a disk - stack setup ( white circles ) .",
    "the disks are mostly fabricated in the order of the disk number .",
    "figure  [ rddsrf ] also shows the integrated phase error ( broken line ) , expected from the measured deviation of the fundamental - mode frequencies .",
    "it is seen that by fine - adjusting the cell cavity size ( denoted as @xmath15 in figure  [ rddsrf ] ) based on the past trend of frequency errors , the total integrated phase error can be controlled with an extreme precision .",
    "also , the first - order transverse mode frequencies of the fabricated disks have been found to have a smooth distribution within 0.4 to 0.6 mhz .",
    "overall , the micron - level precision to which the disks are machined have been very successfully demonstrated .",
    "the disks are then stacked on a precision v - block , where a disk - to - disk alignment of 1 @xmath7 m or better is possible during stacking .",
    "a growth of the so - called `` bookshelf '' stack errors is prevented by monitoring the inclination angles of the surface of stacked disks with a two - axis autocollimator and by applying corrections during stacking .",
    "formation of the complete accelerating structure is made through ( i ) the diffusion bonding procedure of the copper disks that is conducted in two steps ( prebonding and final bonding ) , and ( ii ) the brazing of external components such as cooling water tubing , fixtures for support frames , waveguides and flanges .",
    "it has been found repeatedly that the disk - to - disk alignment and the `` bookshelving '' error ( of its absense thereof ) of the disks are well maintained throughout the diffusion bonding process , which create vacuum - tight and mechanically strong enough disk - to - disk bonding junctions .",
    "however , differential expansion of the ceramics endplate supports relative to the first and the last copper disks lead to a flaring of the structure ends during diffusion bonding .",
    "similar deformation occurred on rdds1 when a stainless steel manifold was installed on a mid portion of the structure during brazing .",
    "while the former error could be rectified later , the bonding techniques used in the assembly of x - band structures call for some improvements in the near future , in addition to studies of mass - production issues .",
    "results from wakefield measurements of rdds1 prototype are reported in a contribution submitted to this conference  @xcite . also , issues pertaining to rf processing and high power operation of x - band accelerating structures at field gradient up to 70@xmath080 mv / m are being investigated@xcite .",
    "development work is also under way@xcite for : klystron modulators with semiconductor switching devices , construction of x - band high - power klystrons with periodic - permanent magnet ( ppm ) focusing , testing of the dlds ( delay line distribution system ) components ( see figure  [ dlds ] ) , development of x - band high - power rf windows@xcite .",
    "some of the efforts are carried out in collaboration with a group from protvino branch of binp , russia , as well as with slac in the framework of the kek - slac isg .",
    "a low - power testing of transmission of x - band rf through a long ( @xmath050 m ) waveguide as a proof - of - principle experiment of the dlds concept was successfully conducted at kek by a kek - slac - protvino collaboration in 1999 .",
    "another testing is planned for fall , 2000 .",
    "a high - power testing of protvino - kek rf windows have been successfully carried out at slac in late 1999 through early 2000 . as of august , 2000 , intense testing",
    "is being conducted on kek site for a ppm klystron that was designed at kek and built in collaboration with japanese industry .    in a few years",
    ", when the basic r&d of these rf components , including the accelerating structures , becomes sufficiently mature , it is considered highly desirable to build a small part of the x - band linac , for instance a complete unit set of the rf system as shown in figure  [ dlds ] . while its successful operation without any beam acceleration should already mark a major milestone , possible acceleration of low - emittance beams which would be hopefully available by that time from atf",
    "would play a decisive role in showing the feasibility of jlc / nlc .",
