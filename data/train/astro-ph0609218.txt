    "the content of the universe can be appropriately described as a four - fluid system : baryons , radiation , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "such fluids can be considered in good approximation to be decoupled from each other after recombination time .",
    "each fluid carries its own rest frame .",
    "thus for instance , the cmb radiation , being highly homogeneous allows us to define its rest frame by means of the cmb dipole anisotropy .",
    "indeed , in the usual interpretation @xcite , the cmb dipole is due to the doppler effect caused by the motion of the observer with respect to the last scattering surface",
    ". therefore the radiation rest frame would be that in which an observer measures a vanishing dipole .",
    "this fact in turn has been used to calculate the velocity of our local group with respect to the cmb radiation , just by substracting the velocity of the sun with respect to the milky way and the milky way velocity with respect to the local group .",
    "the result is @xmath0 km s@xmath1 in the direction @xmath2 in galactic coordinates .",
    "the rest frame of ( dark ) matter is not so easily defined since we know that matter distribution is only homogeneous on very large scales .",
    "the presence of density inhomogeneities makes the velocity of a given matter volume to deviate from the pure hubble flow .",
    "such deviations @xmath3 are known as peculiar velocities and they are related to the density perturbations @xmath4 by this simple expression to first order in perturbation theory : @xmath5 according to the cosmological principle , the universe is homogeneous on very large scales and the amplitude of density perturbations on scales of size @xmath6 will decline as we take larger and larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "this in turn means that the peculiar velocity of a matter volume of radius @xmath6 will also decline for larger @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the matter rest frame eventually converging to the radiation frame on very large scales .",
    "in other words , matter and radiation would share a common rest frame according to the cosmological principle .",
    "however as shown in fig .",
    "1 , this theoretical framework is not conclusively confirmed by observations . indeed , in recent years several peculiar velocity surveys @xcite have tried to determine the volume size at which the streaming motion of matter with respect to the cmb vanishes . in the figure the results of different observations are compared with the _ rms _ expected bulk velocity @xmath7 for standard @xmath8cdm model in a sphere of radius @xmath6 .",
    "the results seem to agree with the theoretical expectations only at scales @xmath9 mpc . at larger scales , @xmath10 mpc ,",
    "different data sets lead to different bulk velocities both in amplitude and direction . moreover , there are indeed measurements in which large matter volumes are moving at speeds @xmath11 km s@xmath1 with respect to the cmb frame , several standard deviations away from the theoretical predictions .",
    "these results have been argued to be affected by systematic errors in distance indicators , but if confirmed by future surveys , a revision of some of the underlying ideas in standard cosmology would be required in order to understand the origin of such large flows .     for different peculiar velocity surveys @xcite centered around the local group in the cmb frame .",
    "the dot labelled by cobe denotes the velocity of the local group measured by cobe .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the expected _ rms _ velocity in the standard @xmath8cdm cosmology , together with the 90% deviation in dashed lines .",
    "figure from s. zaroubi @xcite ]    concerning the dark energy rest frame , it is usually assummed that dark energy does not cluster on small scales and therefore can be considered as a highly homogeneous fluid which is almost decoupled from the rest of components , its only interaction being of gravitational nature .",
    "in such a case there is no reason to expect that its rest frame should necessarily agree with the matter / radiation frame and therefore an observational determination of the dark energy bulk velocity would be needed . in the following",
    "we will explore this problem , considering cosmological models with four decoupled homogeneous fluids and different rest frames @xcite .",
    "let us therefore consider a cosmological scenario with four perfect fluids : baryons , radiation , dark matter and dark energy , whose equations of state read @xmath12 with @xmath13 . for the sake of generality , we will allow the dark energy equation of state to have a smooth dependence on redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of each fluid will take the form : @xmath15 since we are only interested in the effects of fluids motion on the cmb dipole , it is sufficient to take into account the evolution of the largest - scale velocity perturbations , i.e. we will just consider the zero - mode equations .",
    "the presence of inhomogeneities will contribute to higher multipoles .",
    "therefore , for this particular problem we can write : @xmath16    we will assume that @xmath17 and we will work at first order in perturbation theory . in the particular case we are considering",
    ", the form of the space - time metric will be given by the following vector - perturbed spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric : @xmath18 accordingly , the total energy - momentum tensor reads : @xmath19 notice that we are considering only the epoch after matter - radiation decoupling , assuming that dark energy is also decoupled and for that reason we will ignore possible energy and momentum transfer effects .",
    "we now calculate the linearized einstein equations using ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ t ] ) .",
    "they yield just the condition : @xmath20    in general relativity the combination @xmath21 appearing in ( [ s ] ) plays the role of inertial mass density of the corresponding fluid , and accordingly @xmath22 can be understood as the _ cosmic center of mass velocity_. notice that a pure cosmological constant has no inertial mass density .    on the other hand ,",
    "the energy conservation equations are trivially satisfied , whereas from momentum conservation we see that the velocity of each fluid relative to the center of mass frame scales as : @xmath23 notice that for dark energy the scaling properties will depend on the particular model under consideration @xcite .",
    "once we know the form of the perturbed metric , we can calculate the effect of fluids motion on photons propagating from the last scattering surface using standard tools @xcite .",
    "the energy of a photon coming from direction @xmath24 with @xmath25 as seen by an observer moving with velocity @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 , i.e. to first order in the perturbation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 parametrizes the photon energy and the perturbed trajectory of the photon reads @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .    in order to obtain @xmath32",
    ", we solve the geodesics equations to first order in the perturbations , and for the 0-component we get @xmath33 . by defining @xmath34 ,",
    "the temperature fluctuation reads : @xmath35 where the indices @xmath36 , @xmath37 denote the present and decoupling times respectively .",
    "today the only relevant contributions to the center of mass motion are those of matter and dark energy , radiation being negligible , so that : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the present equation of state of dark energy and we have assumed that today the relative velocity of baryons and dark matter is negligible .",
    "for that reason we have used @xmath40 to denote them both simultaneously .",
    "notice that for a pure cosmological constant @xmath41 and there would be no contribution from dark energy in such a case .    at decoupling ,",
    "the universe is matter dominated and we can neglect the contribution to @xmath22 from dark energy .",
    "therefore : @xmath42 where the emitter velocity is nothing but the baryonic velocity @xmath43 .",
    "as we will see below , when dark energy is absent , it is in the form of a pure cosmological constant or it is at rest with respect to radiation , we will have @xmath44 and this term vanishes .",
    "according to this result , the cmb dipole has two different types of contributions : one is the usual doppler effect due to the change of velocity between emitter and observer ; the second contribution comes from the fact that the photon is propagating in an anisotropic medium which is changing in time .",
    "this second contribution is precisely given by the change in the velocity of the cosmic center of mass between emission and reception .",
    "the possibility that the dipole is not enterely due to a doppler effect has been considered previously in the litereature in different contexts ( see @xcite ) .",
    "when all the components share a common rest frame then the previous result reduces to the usual expression for the dipole : @xmath45 .",
    "however in general it is possible that an observer at rest with radiation @xmath46 can measure an nonvanishing dipole according to ( [ dipolo ] ) .    in the absence of dark energy or in the case",
    "in which it is in the form of a pure cosmological constant ( @xmath47 ) , dark energy would not contribute to the center of mass motion .",
    "moreover , today the radiation contribution is negligible and accordingly the center of mass rest frame would coincide with the matter rest frame .",
    "this implies that the relative motion of matter and radiation today could not explain the existence of bulk flows on the largest scales , since the frame in which the dipole vanishes would coincide with the matter rest frame .",
    "conversely , the existence of non - vanishing bulk flows would require the presence of moving dark energy with @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , if moving dark energy is responsible for the existence of cosmic bulk flows on very large scales , then the amplitude and direction of such flows would provide a way to measure the relative velocity of matter and dark energy .",
    "as commented above , the bulk flow @xmath49 can be understood as the average velocity of a given matter volume with respect to an observer who measures a vanishing cmb dipole , i.e. @xmath50 . such an observer has a velocity which can be obtained from ( [ dipolo ] ) , and accordingly : @xmath51    notice that , according to these results , even if matter is at rest with respect to the cmb radiation , @xmath52 , it would be possible to have a non - vanishing flow @xmath53 , provided dark energy is moving with respect to matter .",
    "so far we have considered only the effects of the different components of the universe having different rest frames .",
    "however we have not discussed what is the origin of such a velocity offset . in standard cosmology , baryonic matter and radiation were coupled before recombination , and this was also so for dark matter , in the case in which it is in the form of weakly interacting massive particles .",
    "however the nature of dark energy is still a mistery and we ignore what is the type of interaction , if any , between dark energy and radiation / matter .",
    "for that reason , the primordial value of the dark energy rest frame velocity with respect to radiation / matter should be considered as a completely free cosmological parameter , which could be determined only by observations .",
    "although the primordial value is unknown , its subsequent evolution is given by ( [ velocity ] ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show the evolution of the velocities of the different fluids with respect to the center of mass frame . we compare two models for dark energy , one in which the equation of state is a constant close to @xmath54 and a scaling @xcite dark energy model in which the equation of state mimics that of the dominant component . we see that the velocity of radiation is almost constant throughout the cosmological evolution , whereas although matter is initially dragged by radiation , its velocity starts decaying as @xmath55 after decoupling .",
    "dark energy velocity is damped very fast for constant equation of state , whereas it could have appreciable amplitude today in scaling models .",
    "apart from the effects on the dipole , the metric anisotropies generated by the motion of dark energy can give rise in some cases to non - negligible quadrupole contributions and generate a net polarization of the cmb radiation .",
    "such effects offer additional possibilities for the determination of the dark energy rest frame .",
    "these results will be presented elsewhere @xcite",
