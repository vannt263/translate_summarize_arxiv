    "the intra - nuclear cascade model ( inc ) was first proposed by serber in 1947 @xcite .",
    "he noticed that , in particle - nuclear collisions the debroglie wave - length of the incident particle is comparable to or shorter than the average intra - nucleon distance .",
    "hence , the justification for describing the interactions in terms of particle - particle collisions .    the inc has been successfully used in the monte carlo simulations at intermediate energy region since goldberger made first calculations by hand in 1947 @xcite .",
    "first computer simulations were done by metropolis et al . in 1958",
    "standard methods in inc implementations were formed when bertini published his results in 1968 @xcite .",
    "an important addition was exciton model introduced by griffin in 1966 @xcite .",
    "our presentation describes the implementation of a bertini inc model in the geant4 hadronic physics frameworks @xcite .",
    "geant4@xcite is a monte carlo particle detector simulation toolkit , having applications also in the medical field and space sciences .",
    "geant4 provides a flexible framework for modular implementation of various kinds of hadronic interactions .",
    "geant4 exploits advanced software engineering techniques and object oriented technology to achieve the transparency of the physics implementation and to this way provide the possibility of validating the physics results more easily .    at level-2",
    ", the hadronic model frameworks are based on concepts of physics processes , cross - section and models for final state generation . while the process is a general concept ,",
    "models are allowed to have restrictions in process type , material , element and energy range .",
    "several models can be utilized by one process class ; for instance , a process class for inelastic scattering can use distinct models for different energies .",
    "process classes utilize model classes to determine the secondaries produced in the interaction and to calculate the momenta of the particles . here",
    "we preset a collection of such models providing medium - energy intra - nuclear cascade treatment .",
    "in inelastic particle - nucleus collisions a fast phase ( @xmath0 ) of inc results in a highly exited nucleus , and is followed by fission and pre - equilibrium emission .",
    "a slower ( @xmath1 ) compound nucleus phase follows with evaporation .",
    "a boltzman equation must be solved to treat the physical process of the collision in detail .",
    "the intra - nuclear cascade model developed by bertini @xcite solves the boltzmann equation on the average .",
    "the model has been implemented in several codes such as hetc @xcite .",
    "our model is based on re - engineering of inucl code @xcite .",
    "models included are a bertini intra - nuclear cascade model with exitons , a pre - equilibrium model , a simple nuclear explosion model , a fission model , and a evaporation model .    the nuclear model consist of a three - region approximation to the continuously changing density distribution of nuclear matter within nuclei .",
    "relativistic kinematics is applied throughout the cascade .",
    "the cascade is stopped when all the particles which can escape the nucleus , have done so .",
    "then conformity with the energy conservation law is checked .",
    "particles treated are nucleons , pions , photons , and nuclear isotopes . a bullet particle can be a proton , neutron or pion .",
    "the range of targets allowed is arbitrary .",
    "the necessary condition of validity of the inc model is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the debroglie wavelength of the nucleons , @xmath4 is the average relative nucleon - nucleon velocity and @xmath5 is the time interval between collisions .",
    "the physical foundation becomes approximate at energies less than about @xmath6 , and there needs to be supplemented with a pre - equilibrium model .",
    "also , at energies higher than 5 - 10 gev the inc picture breaks down .",
    "our implementation in geant4 has been tested with bullet kinetic energy between 100  mev and 3  gev .",
    "the basic steps of the inc model are summarized below :    1 .",
    "the spatial point , where the incident particle enters , is selected uniformly over the projected area of the nucleus .",
    "2 .   total ,",
    "free particle - particle cross - sections and region - dependent nucleon densities are used to select the path length for the projectile particle .",
    "3 .   the momentum of a struck nucleon , the type of reaction , and the four momentum of the reaction products are determined .",
    "4 .   the exciton model is updated as the cascade proceeds . 5 .",
    "if pauli s exclusion principle allows and @xmath7 = 2  mev , step ( 2 ) is performed to transport the products .",
    "after inc , the residual excitation energy of the resulting nucleus is used as input for a non - equilibrium model .",
    "the schematic presentation of bertini s inc is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmc ]          some of the basic features of the nuclear model are the following :    * the nucleons are assumed to to have a fermi gas momentum distribution .",
    "the fermi energy is calculated in a local density approximation i.e. it is made radius dependent with fermi momentum @xmath8 . *",
    "the nucleon s binding energies ( be ) are calculated using a mass formula .",
    "a parametrization of the nuclear binding energy uses a combination of the kummel mass formula , and experimental data .",
    "also , a asymptotic high temperature mass formula is used , for cases where it is not possible to use experimental data .",
    "the initialization phase fixes the nucleus radius and momentum according to the fermi gas model .    if the target is hydrogen ( a = 1 ) , a direct particle - particle collision is performed , and no nuclear modeling is used .",
    "if @xmath9 , a nuclei model consisting one layer with radius of 8.0 fm is created .    for @xmath10 ,",
    "a nuclei model is composed of three concentric spheres @xmath11 with radii @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14    if @xmath15 , nuclei are modeled with three concentric spheres as well .",
    "the sphere radii are then defined as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .    the potential energy for nucleon n is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a fermi momentum and",
    "be a binding energy .",
    "impulse distribution in each region follows fermi distribution with zero temperature .    @xmath20    where    @xmath21    here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the number of protons or neutrons in a region and @xmath19 is momentum corresponding the fermi energy    @xmath24    which depends on the density @xmath25 of particles , and which is different for each particle and each region .",
    "pauli s exclusion principle forbids interactions where the products would be in occupied states .",
    "following the assumption of a completely degenerate fermi gas , the levels are filled from the lowest level .",
    "the minimum energy allowed for a collision product corresponds to the lowest unfilled level of system , which is the fermi energy in the region .",
    "so in practice , pauli exclusion principle is taken into account by accepting only secondary nucleons which have @xmath26 .",
    "path lengths of nucleons in the nucleus are sampled according to the local density and free nucleon - nucleon cross - sections .",
    "angles after collisions are sampled from experimental differential cross - sections .",
    "tabulated total reaction cross - sections are calculated by letaw s formulation @xcite . for nucleon - nucleon cross - sections , parameterizations based on the experimental energy and isospin dependent data .",
    "the parameterization described in @xcite is used .    for pion",
    "the inc cross - sections are provided to treat elastic collisions , and inelastic channels : @xmath27n @xmath28 @xmath29n , @xmath29p @xmath28 @xmath30n and @xmath29n @xmath28 @xmath27p .",

    "the geant4 cascade model implements the exciton model proposed by griffin @xcite . in this model nuclear states",
    "are characterized by the number of exited particles and holes ( the exitons ) .",
    "inc collisions give rise to a sequence of states characterized by increasing exciton number , eventually leading to a equilibrated nucleus .",
    "for practical implementation of the exciton model we use level density parameters from @xcite and the matrix elements from @xcite .    in the exciton model the possible selection rules for particle - hole configurations in the course of the cascade are : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 , where p is the number of particle , h is number of holes and n = p + h is the number of exitons .",
    "the cascade pre - equilibrium model uses target excitation data , and exciton configurations for neutron and proton to produce the non - equilibrium evaporation .",

    "the parameterizations of the level density used , are tabulated both with their a and z dependence and including a high temperature behavior .",
    "the nuclear binding energy is using a smooth liquid high energy formula .",
    "fermi break - up is allowed only in some extreme cases , i.e. for light nuclei ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and if @xmath36 . a simple explosion model decays the nucleus into neutrons and protons and decreases exotic evaporation processes .",
    "the fission model is a phenomenological model using potential minimization .",
    "binding energy parametrization is used and some features of the fission statistical model are incorporated as in@xcite .      the statistical theory for particle emission from exited nuclei remaining after inc was originally developed by weisskopf @xcite .",
    "this model assumes complete energy equilibration before particle emission , and re - equilibration of excitation energies between successive evaporation emissions . as a result",
    ", the angular distribution of emitted particles is isotropic .",
    "the geant4 evaporation model for cascade implementation adapts the widely used computational method developed by dostrowski @xcite .",
    "the emission of particles is computed until the excitation energy fall below a cutoff . if a light nucleus is highly exited , a fermi break - up model is executed .",
