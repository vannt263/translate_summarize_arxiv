    "the direct study of warm molecular hydrogen emission from galaxies has been improving considerably through the advent of more sensitive space - bourne spectrometers on the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( e. g. @xcite ) and more recently on the _ spitzer _ space telescope . with the infrared spectrograph ( irs )",
    "@xcite on _ spitzer _ @xcite it has been possible to improve upon systematic studies of the mid - ir pure - rotational lines of molecular hydrogen in a variety of environments , from nearby normal galaxies @xcite , to galaxies in more extreme environments , like groups and clusters @xcite and ulirgs @xcite ( see also a review on molecules by @xcite ) .",
    "recently unusually strong mid - ir h@xmath1 lines have been discovered in the giant shock - wave structure in stephan s quintet @xcite , and in over a dozen low - luminosity radio galaxies @xcite , where h@xmath1 are often the strongest in mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "strong h@xmath1 equivalent widths were also found near the `` overlap '' region in the antenna interacting galaxy @xcite .",
    "these systems have extremely large h@xmath1 equivalent widths and line luminosities ( l@xmath3 ergs / s ) , and relatively low star formation rates .",
    "another defining characteristic is the large ratio of h@xmath1 luminosity to pah line strength , and the large ( 0.1 to 30% ) fraction of h@xmath1 luminosity to the total bolometric luminosity of the objects .",
    "even larger h@xmath1 line luminosities have been found associated with several massive galaxies in x - ray clusters ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "this new class of powerful h@xmath1 emitting galaxy appears to be shock excited , and models of stephan s quintet , where a large - scale shock is strongly implicated suggest that a significant fraction of the bulk kinetic energy in the shock must be funnelled into the h@xmath1 line in order to explain the results @xcite . in this context , it is of considerable interest to find other examples of the same kind of emission in nearby systems .",
    "this paper describes strong h@xmath1 emission from the strongly interacting galaxy pair arp  143 .",
    "arp  143 is an interacting pair of galaxies ( ngc 2444/2445 ) with many of the necessary ingredients for a study of shocks generated by galaxy collisions .",
    "the southern gas - rich component of the pair , ngc 2445 , is notable for the ring of stellar clusters and hii regions , whereas the so companion is devoid of activity .",
    "it is possible that ngc 2445 shares some similarities with collisional ring galaxies ( like the cartwheel ring ) , because the powerful star - forming knots lie along a crescent - shaped wave of hi emission @xcite , and there is kinematic evidence that the structure is expanding through the disk @xcite .",
    "early unpublished spectroscopy by @xcite and optical and near - ir photometry of the knots @xcite suggest the star clusters are quite young @xmath430 - 60myrs , much younger than the dynamical age of the expanding hi wave  thus providing evidence that they are triggered by a collision with ngc 2444 .",
    "@xcite estimated sub - solar ( lmc - like ) metallicity in the disk knots in the range 12+log[o / h ]  =  8.56 - 8.77 , similar to other known collisional ring galaxies ( see bransford et al .",
    "the nucleus has mildly super - solar values of 12+log[o / h ]  =  9.18similar to nuclear starbursts .    however , this simple picture is complicated by the unsolved mystery of the large 150kpc - long hi plume @xcite which extends just to the north of ngc 2444 .",
    "the existence of such a long plume implies that the two galaxies involved in the collision have had a previous major tidal encounter in the past @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest interpretation of the system is that ngc 2444 may have experienced an initial close passage with ngc 2445 @xmath5100  myrs ago , stripping hi into the plume from ngc 2444 .",
    "after an initial non - pentrating encounter , the main stellar body of ngc 2444 has returned to collide recently with the disk of ngc 2445 in a manner similar to collisional ring galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will present new multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data of arp  143 , another example of a galaxy with very strong mid - ir h@xmath1 emission .",
    "our goal is to connect the recent dynamical events in arp  143 with the shock and star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "the paper will use _ spitzer _ , _ galex _ , and new ground based optical and near - ir images as well as mid - ir spectroscopy to explore the physical conditions in arp  143 .",
    "this will include the study of the dust and hii region properties , ages and luminosities of star formation regions and the excitation conditions of the warm h@xmath1 gas .",
    "after a description of the images and spectra in  2 , we will present in  3 the multiwavelength photometry and the spectral analysis . in  4 , the discussion of the results will follow two main directions : the analysis of the shock region using mainly results from the spectral analysis , and the star formation history of the knots based on an interpretation of the uv - infrared seds of each knot .",
    "we will assume a distance to arp  143 of 56.7 mpc based on its corrected virgo - centric velocity of 4142 km / s and an assumed h@xmath6=73 km / s / mpc .",
    "at this distance , 1 arcsecs corresponds to 275pc .",
    "the spectra were taken on october 24 , 2004 using the irs @xcite on board of the spitzer space telescope .",
    "all spectral data were processed using irs pipeline version s15 .",
    "fig .  [ slits ] shows an overlay of the irs low- and high - resolution slits on a v - band image .",
    "we have a completely sampled map in the long - low ( ll ; 15 - 37 @xmath7 m ) spectral mapping mode , consisting of 17 pointings ( each with a 32 s exposure ) : a total ll exposure time of 544 s. a sparsely - sampled map was obtained with short - low ( sl ; 5 - 14 @xmath7 m ) which did not fully sample the galaxy as shown in the figure .",
    "it consisted of 30 pointings with 61 s exposures each : a total sl exposure time 1891 s. since the ll and sl observations are composed of two sub - slits , each observed separately , convenient off - source `` background '' exposures were automatically obtained during the observations .",
    "these observations were selected to be free of line emission and were subtracted from each on - source exposure .",
    "high - resolution spectra of the nucleus were taken in two nods with two 31 s exposures each for short and long wavelengths ( sh and lh ) , resulting in a total integration time of 248 s. for each module we averaged the exposures for both nod positions .",
    "after the removal of bad pixels , we extracted the spectra for each module , using smart @xcite , a tool for the extraction and analysis of spitzer - irs spectra , written in idl .",
    "for the high - resolution spectra we did not subtract a background since there was no suitable `` sky '' spectrum taken .",
    "these observations were made early - on in the spitzer mission before it was realized that obtaining a  sky \" observation away for the target was useful for rogue - pixel removal ( especially lh ) .",
    "therefore , our sh and lh observations contain low - level zodiacal light in addition to the continuum from the galaxy .",
    "this does not affect the measurements of line fluxes ( see later ) but potentially can affect the measurement of the absolute continuum .",
    "the source was sufficiently bright that rogue - pixel removal was not a large issue in the case .",
    "extraction of all the in - target low - resolution spectra was performed using cubism @xcite , an idl tool for the construction and analysis of spatially resolved spectral cubes using _",
    "spitzer / irs _ spectra .",

    "this means that there is no continuum flux detected at this wavelength .",
    "however , the pah features are detected above the sensitivity level .",
    "the peak of the @xmath40 m pah feature , for example , is at 4 mjy , well above the @xmath56 sensitivity of the sl slit at this wavelength , which is 0.6 mjy . in fig .",

    "it is even more dominated by distinctive h@xmath1 lines , especially the h@xmath1 s(1 ) line at @xmath45 m , although pah features can also be seen , especially at @xmath43 m .",
    "the ionic lines are not so prominent , as the spectrum was taken in a region not dominated by star forming clusters .      using the pure rotational h@xmath1 lines we can probe the physical conditions of the warm molecular hydrogen in the star forming knots .",
    "the pure rotational lines originate from the warm ( t @xmath57 k ) gas .",
    "we measured the h@xmath1 rotational line fluxes using smart , and derived their excitation temperatures , column densities , and masses of their temperature components .",
    "[ h2diag ] shows the excitation diagrams of the detected h@xmath1 transitions and upper limits for the knots e , f , g , the nucleus , and the ring .",
    "each excitation diagram consist on a plot of the natural logarithm of the column density @xmath58 divided by the statistical weight @xmath59 in the upper level of each transition against the upper level excitation temperature @xmath60 .",
    "the column density follows from the boltzmann equation :    @xmath61    where n(i ) is the molecular column density of the ith transition , @xmath58 is the total column density of h@xmath1 , g(i ) is the statistical weight for the ith transition , and @xmath62 is the partition function at the excitation temperature @xmath60 .",
    "the values of g for odd and even transitions are different because of the ortho and para transitions .",
    "the h@xmath1 line fluxes , and the molecular gas temperatures , column densities and masses are listed in table  [ tabh2 ] .",
    "the excitation temperature of the line - emitting gas is the reciprocal of the slope of the excitation diagram , and corresponds to the kinetic temperature in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "however , the nonlinear decline of log ( n / g ) with upper - level energy , commonly seen in shocks within the galaxy , as well as in external galaxies @xcite , is an indication that no single - temperature lte model fits these data .",
    "the lowest temperatures are measured in knots e and g , using s(0 ) and s(1 ) .",
    "the temperatures for knots f and h were derived from higher excitation transitions , s(1 ) and s(2 ) , as s(0 ) was not detected .",
    "the measured temperatures are 137 k for knot e , 280 k for knot f , 178 k for knot g , and 309 k for the nucleus .",
    "we can see that the molecular gas is hotter in knot f ( 280 k ) and in the nucleus ( 309 k ) , but denser in knot e , where most of the warm molecular gas is concentrated .",
    "it is important to note that the temperatures for knots e and g were derived using only the s(0 ) and s(1 ) transitions , whereas higher transitions were used in other knots resulting in a higher average temperature of the gas .",
    "the derived excitation temperature is also dependent on the ortho - to - para ratio for h@xmath1 . during the fit to a multi - temperature model through the preferred data points ,",
    "we constrain the warm gas by the s(0)/s(2 ) [ para ] ratio and allowing the higher order s(3 ) and s(5 ) [ ortho ] transitions to provide a very rough guide to the temperature of a hotter component , resulting in ortho - to - para ratios of 2.2 for knot e , 2.7 for knot g , and @xmath63 for knot f , the nucleus , and the ridge .",
    "these ratios agree with lte models @xcite .",
    "the various masses are derived multiplying the column density by the physical area of the aperture corresponding to the knot .",
    "we used pahfit @xcite to measure the pah emission features for each of the knots .",
    "some pah features are decomposed by pahfit into gaussian components , such as the @xmath41 m and @xmath43 m features , and merged for the calculation of their total flux and ews .",
    "the results of the pah feature fits are listed in table  [ tabpah ] .",
    "most of the pah features lay on the sl part of the spectrum , meaning that the sparse map only has a 2 pixel wide coverage of the knots .",
    "we therefore make an extrapolation of the results taken with these observations to the total area of the knots .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the pah emission comes from the nucleus , which is also the region with the most emission at @xmath2 m ( fig .",
    "[ multiband ] ) . from the star forming ring , knots a ,",
    "c , e , and f have pah associated with the star clusters .",
    "knot e is the one with the highest pah emission , and this is also expected from the @xmath2 m irac image in fig .  [ multiband ] ) .      in table",
    "[ tablines ] we present the fluxes of the main ionized gas lines in the low resolution spectra , as measured using smart .",
    "the errors listed reflect the s / n ratio at the wavelengths where the lines were measured . with these fluxes we calculated the ionic line ratios [ neiii]/[neii ] , [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 @xmath7 m , and also [ siii]/[siii ] .",
    "the [ neiii]/[neii ] rate , because it is a rate between two ionization states of the same element , it is sensitive to the effective temperature of the ionizing stars , and therefore can be used as a measure of the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "this ratio varies typically between 0.05 and 1 in starburst galaxies and hii regions in normal galaxies , and is typically greater than 1 in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we could only measure the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio for knots e , f , and for the nucleus , and the results are 0.52 , 0.67 , and 0.08 .",
    "the ratios for knots e and f are compatible with very young massive clusters , and are similar to those found in very young clusters in other interacting systems such as the antennae , where star forming regions with [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios between 0.30 - 0.73 are found @xcite .",
    "the ratio for the nucleus is much smaller than the ratios for the ring knots and are similar to the ratios found in the nuclei of starburst galaxies , like ngc 253 ( 0.07 ; @xcite ) .    the [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 @xmath7 m ratio , as it is a ratio between two lines of the same ionization state , but with different critical densities for collisions with electrons @xcite .",
    "therefore it is sensitive only to the density of the ionized ism .",
    "the [ siii]33.5@xmath7 m line was detected in all knots , but the [ siii]18.7@xmath7 m was detected only in knots e , f , g , and in the nucleus .",
    "as seen in table  [ tablines ] , the values for [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 @xmath7 m ratio for these knots vary between 0.50 in knots e and f and 1.34 in knot g although with a large measurement error for the last case .",
    "the [ siii]/[siii ] line ratio is used as a starburst / agn diagnostic @xcite .",
    "this is because the [ si ii]34.82 @xmath7 m line is a significant coolant of x - ray ionized regions or dense photodissociation regions @xcite , more commonly associated with agn , whereas the [ s iii]33.48 @xmath7 m line is a strong marker of h ii regions .",
    "the typical value found in agns is around 3 , whereas for nuclear starbursts is around 1 @xcite .",
    "we measured this ratio for all knots , varying from 0.82@xmath640.22 in the nucleus to 1.97@xmath640.51 .",
    "the low signal - to - noise ratio in clusters b , c , and d is reflected in the high errors of the [ siii]/[siii ] measurements , and therefore all the values for this ratio are compatible with the values for nuclear starbursts found in @xcite .      to study the ism conditions in the nucleus with greater accuracy we took a high resolution spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 2445 , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ hires ] .",
    "we scaled up the sh spectrum by multiplying it by a factor of 1.7 to match the lh spectrum flux at @xmath65 m .",
    "this factor is much lower than the difference between the sh and lh slits , but that is simply due to the fact that the nucleus is practically a point source .",
    "the lh and sh spectra were then joined together , resulting in a single @xmath66 m high resolution spectrum of the nucleus .",
    "the main features present are the ionic lines , like [ neii ] , [ neiii ] , [ siii ] , and [ siii ] .",
    "pah bands are also visible , as the @xmath43 m band , and the @xmath67 m feature . also present",
    "are the h@xmath1 rotational lines .",
    "these features allow a physical characterization of the ism of the nucleus , and they can be used to diagnose electron temperature and density and h@xmath1 gas temperature .",
    "the measured line ratios are listed in table  [ tablines ] , along with the lines measured in the same knot using the low resolution spectrum .",
    "we can see that the low resolution line fluxes have roughly half the flux as the high resolution lines .",
    "this is due to the difference in the extraction apertures .",
    "the area of the lh slit is 231 arcsec@xmath68 , nearly twice the area of the low resolution extraction aperture chosen for the nucleus , which is 104 arcsec@xmath68 .",
    "this gives a ratio of 2.22 , whereas the ratio between low and high resolution apertures for both the [ neii ] and [ neiii ] flux is 2.04 , meaning that the surface brightness of the lines decreases with a wider aperture .",
    "however , to do a comparison of the continuum fluxes one has to estimate the background flux .",
    "we measured the background flux from an off - source sl slit , which gives 116 mjy and 95 mjy for 15@xmath7 m and 24@xmath7 m , after scaling for aperture sizes .",
    "that means that the background accounts for @xmath69 of the high - resolution continuum at 15@xmath7 m and @xmath70 of the high - resolution continuum at 24@xmath7 m .",
    "the ratio of the continuum flux at 15 @xmath7 m is thus 1.6 , meaning that the surface brightness of the warm dust decreases with the aperture .",
    "the ratio for the @xmath15 m continuum is 2.2 , meaning that the surface brightness of cooler dust does not vary with slit size .    comparing the ratios derived from high resolution with the low resolution ratios",
    ", we find a remarkable match for the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , being 0.08 for both spectra , but for the [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 @xmath7 m ratio there are significant differences , being 0.73 for the high resolution spectrum and 0.49 for the low resolution spectrum .",
    "this reflects the different flux ratios between high and low resolution apertures : [ siii]18.7@xmath7 m has a flux ratio of 2.38@xmath640.16 thus maintaining its surface brightness , whereas [ siii]33.5@xmath7 m has a flux ratio of 1.61@xmath640.09 thus decreasing its surface brightness .",
    "this difference possibly reflects a decrease of the ionized gas density as the distance to the nucleus increases .",
    "note that the lh slit could be contaminated by emission form the `` shocked '' gas region , and thus it can affect the line ratios that use lines [ siii ] and [ siii]33.5@xmath7 m and overestimate the nuclear h@xmath1 component .",
    "photometry of each knot was performed using _ aper _ , an idl tool from the idl astronomy library .",
    "we used the fuv galex image to set an aperture size for each knot , as seen in fig .",
    "[ multiband ] .",
    "we used circular apertures of @xmath71 for knots c , f , and the nucleus ; @xmath72 for knots b and d ; and @xmath73 for knots a , f , and g. the sky background was determined using circular apertures of the same size as the ones used to measure each knot . with these apertures , we measured the flux within selected regions inside arp 143  but avoiding the knots  and averaged the results .",
    "we applied extended source corrections for irac photometry .",
    "these corrections depend on the size of the aperture and do not exceed 6.8% .",
    "the resulting fluxes of each of the knots are listed in table  [ tabfluxes ] .",
    "arp  143 was not observed with the mips instrument at 24@xmath7 m .",
    "however , in order to allow us to use some of the well known star- formation indicators ( e. g. @xcite ) associated with the knots based on mips observation , we decided to create pseudo - mips 24@xmath7 m photometric points by extracting 24@xmath7 m data from the full - irs ll map ( see fig .",

    "the companion lenticular galaxy ngc 2444 is prominent only in the optical and k - band , and is rather weak at longer wavelength .",
    "this supports the idea that much of the gas has been swept out of the galaxy in the past and it is dominated by an old inactive stellar population . it is possible that a faintarm \" extended from ngc 2444 behind ngc 2445 , but this is hard to prove without kinematic data .",
    "rotational emission lines of h@xmath1 may arise through three different mechanisms : uv excitation in pdrs surrounding or adjacent to the hii regions ; shocks that accelerate and modify the gas in a cloud , collisionally exciting the h@xmath76 molecules ; and hard x - ray photons capable of penetrating the molecular clouds and heating large ionizing columns of gas .",
    "several rotational h@xmath1 lines were detected in the wavelength range of our observations and they are listed in table  [ tabh2 ] . given that these lines trace the molecular gas at different temperatures , studying the spatial distribution of these excitation lines may give us a clue about the main excitation mechanism .    in fig .",
    "[ h2fig ] we present contour maps of the h@xmath1 s(0 ) ( left ) and h2 s(1 ) emission ( right ) in arp 143 , overlayed on the irac 8@xmath7 m emission color map . the h@xmath1 emission in fig .",
    "[ h2fig ] is concentrated in two clumps  from the nucleus and in a crescent - shaped ridge ( including knot f ) west of the nucleus corresponding to the hi - crescent seen in vla observations .",
    "the emission also is similar , but not identical to co ( 1 - 0 ) interferometry distribution@xcite .",
    "these latter observations trace the distribution of cool h@xmath1 emission through collisional excitation of the co molecule .",
    "the main difference between the spitzer ( warm ) h@xmath1 observations and the co ( cool h@xmath1 tracer ) is that the warm gas seems to better define a crescent - shape .",
    "indeed it is precisely here that a shock wave would be expected to heat up the h@xmath1 , supported by the fact that the s(1 ) map more clearly defines the crescent shape than the s(0 ) line , which is dominated by cooler excitation .",

    "it is also worth noting that the area chosen for the spectrum of the gas ring , demarcated in fig .",
    "[ multiband ] coincides with the area of the shocked h@xmath1 emission .",
    "therefore we can consider this spectrum , in fig .",
    "[ ridge ] as representative of the shocked h@xmath1 region .",
    "the shape of the h@xmath1 emission in fig .",
    "[ h2fig ] is promising but by itself does not settle the case for either pdr or shock origin .",
    "a way to investigate the origin of the excitation of rotational transitions of the h@xmath1 molecule is to make a spatial comparison between the h@xmath1 emission and pah emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission - line strength should track the pah emission - line and ir continuum strength in the case where the most common h@xmath1 excitation mechanism is uv excitation at the pdr interface with star formation regions .",
    "however , we see a remarkable transition in arp 143 , from the nucleus , where pah emission is quite strong , to the non - nuclear h@xmath1 , which remains strong in the h@xmath1 lines , but is very weak in pah ( and continuum ) emission .    @xcite calculated the logarithm of the average ratio of the power emitted in the sum of the s(0 ) to s(2 ) transitions to the power emitted by the pah features within the irac4 band , for hii nuclei and seyferts from the sings survey . the average ratio for hii nuclei @xmath77 and for the seyferts is @xmath78 .",
    "we measured these ratios for the knots where h@xmath1 lines from s(0 ) to s(2 ) have been measured .",
    "we take 7.7@xmath7 m and 8.6@xmath7 m as the pah features inside the irac4 band . for the nucleus of arp 143",
    ", the ratio is -2.26 , which puts it in the average of the hii nuclei .",
    "however , for knots e , f , and , g , the ratios are -1.22 , -0.90 , and -0.94 , respectively .",
    "this puts them well above the averages for hii nuclei and also for seyferts . for the gas ring region , which largely coincides with the h@xmath1 crescent",
    ", this ratio rises up to -0.36 .",
    "so the difference we observe in the h@xmath1/pah ratio between the nucleus and the ring region in arp 143 is a strong indication that the h@xmath1 emission ridge seen in fig .",
    "[ ridge ] is mostly due to shocks .",
    "x - ray emission is unlikely to be a strong contribution to the h@xmath1 heating , since the ratio of the [ siii]/[siii ] lines in arp 143 ( even in the nucleus ) suggests an insignificant contribution to the excitation of [ siii ] from x - rays .",
    "( x - rays can significantly enhance this ratio  as discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "this strongly suggests shock - excitation within the crescent - shaped structure .",
    "a very strong h@xmath1 emission in the absence of strong pah emission is seen in the shock wave in stephan s quintet @xcite and in the spectrum of 3c326 @xcite , where strong shocks are implicated .",
    "the lack of a correspondingly large continuum is also one of the characteristics of the shocked h@xmath1 seen in the radio galaxy sample , and the stephan s quintet , as well as low - excitation emission lines .",
    "we can interpret the excitation diagrams in fig .",
    "[ h2diag ] also in the context of the different origins of the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the temperatures derived in the excitation diagrams are compatible with either a pdr origin or a shock origin for the h@xmath1 excitation .",
    "the h@xmath1 temperature derived for the nucleus is higher than the temperature for the knots associated to the h@xmath1 ridge , and to the h@xmath1 ridge as a whole , still does not reach the level required to rule out pdr origin , and the comparison with the pah emission is crucial . however , these temperatures are just average gas temperatures , and it is possible the presence of a warmer gas component in the h@xmath1 shock region . the column density of the gas is lower in the h@xmath1 ridge than in the knots , which is expected , since the warm h@xmath1 emission from the ridge is more diffuse , whereas the h@xmath1 emission peak coincides with knot f.      the knots in the ring of star formation are very young and are expected to have similar characteristics to young massive clusters discovered in starburst galaxies .",
    "we use our observations to study the components of the ism in these knots , which consist of the molecular gas , ionized gas , and dust .",
    "the properties of the warm molecular gas , as presented in sect .",
    "[ shock ] , can be compared with the properties of the cold molecular gas as studied in @xcite using co observations .",
    "co probes molecular gas up to a temperature of 100 k , but provides no information on the \" warmer  gas which might be more directly linked to the source of activity .",
    "however , we can estimate what fraction of the total gas mass lies in higher temperatures .",
    "the fraction h@xmath1 ( warm ) to h@xmath1 ( cool ) is 4.8% for knots f and g , 2.6% for the nucleus , but 64% for knot e , assuming a co - h@xmath1 conversion factor for the lmc . on average , the fraction of warm to cool h@xmath1 amounts to 10% , which is nearly the same found by @xcite for a sample of starburst galaxies",
    ".    forbidden ionic lines can be used as indicators of the conditions of the ionized gas in the knots and the shock region .",
    "the ratio [ neiii]/[neii ] is used as a measure of electron temperature of the ionized gas ; the [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 @xmath7 m ratio is used as a measure of electron density .",
    "these ratios are compared to modeled ratios derived using photoionization diagnostics by @xcite , assuming salpeter imf , stellar mass cutoffs m@xmath79 and @xmath80 and solar metallicity .    from the [ siii]18.7/[siii]33.5 @xmath7 m ratio we can estimate the density of the knots for which these lines are measured .",
    "this ratio is insensitive to the ionization parameter @xmath81 and age . as seen in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] ( right ) , for any @xmath81 and age , knots e , f , g , and the nucleus have electron densities in the order of @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "this is the average electron density encountered in the center of the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "however knot e , for example has a diameter of @xmath74 kpc , about two times the size of the central region of m82 @xcite , and it is composed of individual clusters that could have much higher densities .",
    "[ ratios ] in the left shows the evolution of the modeled [ neiii]/[neii ] with age , for a given value of the ionization parameter .",
    "due to difficulties in measuring the [ neii ] line in the low resolution spectra , as it is merged with a pah feature at @xmath51 m , we could only measure the ratio for knots e , f , and for the nucleus .",
    "we can see that the measured ratios correspond to knot ages of 1 - 4.5 myr .",
    "the difference in the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio between the nucleus ( 0.08 ) an the ring knots ( 0.5 - 0.7 ) means that population of recently formed massive stars in the nucleus is older than the young bursts in the ring , having an estimated age of 5 - 6 myr .",
    "the fit to the low resolution spectrum of the nucleus gives an a@xmath84 of 0.02 , which is too low to have any effect on the ratios , and therefore extinction does not affect the ratios significantly .",
    "pah molecules with different physical characteristics produce different bands .",
    "the @xmath40 m , @xmath41 m , and the @xmath42 m bands are produced preferentially by ionized pahs whereas the @xmath43 m band is produced primarily by neutral pah molecules .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath85 m may indicate the effect of pah ionization .",
    "we calculate this ratio for all the knots . given the uncertainties in the pah flux measurements , we could only derive a reliable @xmath85 m ratio for knots f and h. we can not see significant differences between the two ratios , at least not bigger than the uncertainties for knot f.      with the fluxes listed in table  [ tabfluxes ] , we built seds of the main knots , in order to further constrain their physical characteristics . to achieve this , we compare the seds with synthetic spectra modeled with starburst99 @xcite .",
    "there are several parameters we need to consider when fitting the model seds to our observations :    * the mode of star formation .",
    "the star formation may occur continuously ( continuous star formation model , or csf model ) or in a single , almost instantaneous , burst ( instantaneous burst model , or isb ) .",
    "we will adopt the isb model for the star - forming knots , as there is no evidence that star formation has been ongoing for any considerable time in these knots . * the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we adopt a kroupa imf with an upper - mass cutoff of 100 m@xmath86 and a lower mass cutoff of 0.02 m@xmath86 . * the initial gas metallicity ( z ) .",
    "we assume sub - solar metallicity @xmath87 , which is similar with the metallicity reported by @xcite . * the age of the star clusters .",
    "this is a free parameter ranging from @xmath88 to @xmath89 yr . *",
    "the effect of extinction .",
    "we use the calzetti starburst extinction law @xcite on the synthetic spectra , * dust emission .    with these conditions , we fitted the synthetic spectra to the measured seds of each knot .",
    "the fluxes listed in table  [ tabfluxes ] were converted to units of ergs@xmath90@xmath90 .",
    "we compensated the optical and uv fluxes for a galactic reddening of e(b - v)=0.051 , using the extinction maps and laws of @xcite and attenuation curve of @xcite , the latter exclusively for the uv fluxes .",
    "along with a pure stellar synthetic spectrum , the output of starburst99 includes a nebular emission component as well , which was added to the stellar spectrum for knots c , e , and f. a set of free parameters , such as age , extinction , and continuum flux were adjusted for each knot in order to minimize the @xmath91 value .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ sed ] , as well as the range of parameters within a 95 % confidence level .",
    "knot b was left out , as knot b has a foreground star that interferes with the measurements .",
    "although the nucleus could be modeled using the above assumptions , the measured optical to uv flux ratio appears always larger than the modeled spectrum . the variation between subsolar metallicity @xmath87 and solar metallicity",
    "does not modify significantly the parameter values .    from the results of the sed fits in table  [ sed ] we can divide the knots in two age groups : knots with ages from 2 - 4 myr ( a , c , e , and f ) , and knots with ages from 7 - 7.5 myr ( d , and g ) .",
    "given that the interaction occurred 100 myr ago @xcite , this age difference is not very significant in terms of the interaction dynamics .",
    "probably due to a clumpy ism , some clouds collapsed earlier than others , forming stars a little ahead in time than others .",
    "the estimated ages come into agreement with fig .",

    "we can see how the irac @xmath92 m and @xmath93 m fluxes , and the synthetic @xmath15 m flux , deviate from the pure stellar model for knot d , indicating the presence of pah and thermal dust emission .",
    "we can also see that the seds are not easily fitted with a simple instantaneous starburst model , and an example is the excess of k - band emission in knot c , observed in fig .",
    "[ figsed ] ( left ) .",
    "a @xmath94-band flux excess was also reported in previous studies that fitted seds with starburst99 ( @xcite for warm uligs ; @xcite for the nuclei of arp 220 ) , which was compensated adding a hot dust ( 800 k ) component contributing to 10 - 30% of the emission @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 2445 was modeled using instantaneous ( isf ) and continuous star formation ( csf ) .",
    "continuous star formation is more a reasonable assumption , based on results from ring models , who predict a continuous fuelling of the nuclear starburst through gas inflow . in this case",
    "we used a kroupa imf with an upper - mass cutoff of 100 m@xmath86 and a lower mass cutoff of 1 m@xmath86 .",
    "we found that the best fit is achieved for the age of 500 myr .",
    "these ages are radically different than those obtained with [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios ( 5  6 myr ) , and this is due to the fact that both [ neii ] and [ neiii ] lines are produced from the gas excitation by the youngest and hottest massive stars , and that isf was assumed in the modelling of the lines .",
    "the age determination achieved here is a significant improvement in comparison with past efforts , e. g. @xcite , as their color - based determinations did not include uv bands .",
    "the fuv and nuv , as demonstrated here , are essential to the breaking of the age - extinction - metallicity degeneracy .      with the h@xmath95 , fuv and mid - infrared continuum fluxes at @xmath96 m , 24@xmath7 m , and @xmath97 m we can derive star formation rates for each knot . using the star formation rate calibration by @xcite we can derive the star formation rate from the h@xmath95 luminosity , which traces the very young and massive stars .",
    "however , the h@xmath95 flux is affected by internal extinction , and for the more dusty clusters , we should use the calzetti calibration law @xcite , which includes the 24@xmath7 m luminosity to compensate extinction that affects the h@xmath95 emission .",
    "far ultraviolet is also a tracer of young massive stars , but even more affected by extinction than h@xmath95 .",
    "we use here the @xmath98 values in table  [ sed ] to correct the fuv fluxes and the calibration by @xcite , which uses galex fuv calibrations .",
    "mid - infrared spectral diagnostics for the sfr were derived in @xcite , based on the fluxes at 15@xmath7 m and 30@xmath7 m . for each spectrum of the knots , we measured the flux at 14.5 - 15.5@xmath7 m and 29.5 - 30.5@xmath7 m , and calculated the sfrs based on the @xcite calibrations . in table",

    "adding all the sfrs of the knots , we arrive to a total sfr of 2.16@xmath640.17 m@xmath99yr@xmath90 from h@xmath10 luminosities and 2.40@xmath640.35 m@xmath99yr@xmath90 using h@xmath100 m luminosities .",
    "this is similar to the 2.5 m@xmath99yr@xmath90 derived by @xcite using the h@xmath101 fluxes but below the the far - infrared sfr of 6.21 m@xmath99yr@xmath90 calculated from iras colors @xcite .",
    "it is also far below the sfr derived from the corrected fuv fluxes , which is in total 15.9 m@xmath99yr@xmath90 .",
    "the sfrs calculated by the @xcite method are systematically below the sfr calculated using the @xcite calibrations , which in turn are below the sfrs derived from fuv .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that most of the energy is detected in the optical and not absorbed by dust , which makes this system distinct from more archetypal starbursts like m82 . here ,",
    "the uv and optical radiation from the clusters is heavily absorbed , making the a@xmath102 at least 10 times higher than in arp 143 @xcite .",
    "this is mitigated in case of the nucleus , which accounts by @xmath103% of the total @xmath15 m flux , and thus the discrepancy is smaller . notice that the star formation rate from uv is heavily dependent on the estimation of a@xmath102 , which values within a 95 % confidence can vary by a factor of two , as seen in table  [ sed ] .",
    "in the past sections we discussed thoroughly the h@xmath1 shocks occurring in ngc 2445 and the ages and densities of the knots that compose the star forming ring .",
    "the strong h@xmath1 emission reported this paper exists in and around the density wave , as traced by hi emission shown in @xcite .",
    "this is expected from shocks created as the wave moves out through the disk .",
    "this is because the gas , unlike the stars in these models , can not pass through each other and shocks should develop at caustics . in this section",
    "we will discuss the role of these shocks in the development of the knots , and its consequences on the morphology of arp 143 .",
    "the sed modeling in this paper provided a further refinement of the age dating of the knots , which is a main advantage over past attempts @xcite .",
    "it showed that not only the hii region nebulosity but also the clusters themselves are consistent with a recent very young burst .",
    "the evolution of pah excitation with starburst age has been speculated by other studies , like @xcite in their analysis of dust excitation in ngc 300 .",
    "we can try to observe this behavior taking advantage of our detailed diagnostics of knot ages .",
    "the improvement on the age dating of the knots allowed us to divide them into two groups : those with an age between 2 - 4 myr old ( knots a , c , e , and f ) , and those with an age of 7 - 8 myr old ( knots d and g ) .",
    "what is remarkable is that the younger group of knots corresponds exactly to the knots where pah counterparts are observed , whereas the older knots are those `` bare '' of pahs , as discussed in section  [ morphology ] and seen in fig .",
    "[ multicolor ] .",
    "this is the first time this ageing effect in star forming galaxies is observed in such chronological detail .",
    "the lack of pah emission in older knots means that the pahs have either `` cleared out '' , ceased to be excited , or destroyed during a timescale of 4 - 5 myr .",
    "the first possibility is that the pah have been `` swept '' after @xmath104 myr by winds from star formation regions .",
    "the @xmath2 m shell in knot a , for example , has @xmath29 kpc in diameter . assuming a wind velocity of 300 km / s , the shell has been expanding for 5 myr , a timescale comparable to the age of the knot . another possibility could be pah destruction .",
    "small molecules could become more exposed over time to the hard uv field and are subsequently destroyed , as the dust shell expands and the pdrs become exposed to the outer radiation field .",
    "however , both these processes also occur in other galaxies where pahs are observed at later ages , like the antennae , so the cause for this behavior resides probably on the nature of the ring galaxy system . due to the shock wave traced by the h@xmath1 emission ,",
    "the knots in the ring were formed simultaneously , and therefore we assume an instantaneous burst for all the knots .",
    "this means that the uv radiation fades away after @xmath104 myr , and no longer excites the dust surrounding the knot .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] , where the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , a measure of the hardness of the radiation field , decreases dramatically after 6 myr .",
    "the slope of the continuum of knots d and g longwards @xmath105 m indicates the presence of cold dust , meaning that dust is present in these knots , but it is not heated by uv radiation .",
    "an older star - forming region with continuous burst like the nucleus of ngc 2445 keeps forming new massive stars which continue to excite pahs and warm up dust",
    ". this could also be the origin of the sfr discrepancy seen in sect .",
    "[ sfrs ] , where the sfrs in the knots calculated from the infrared continuum are systematically lower than the sfrs calculated from h@xmath95 + 24@xmath7 m luminosities , but not the sfr in the nucleus .",
    "the strong h@xmath1 emission reported this paper traces a density wave expanding outwards at a constant speed . in response to the density wave , the knots were formed simultaneously in situ , and that is confirmed by the narrow age range found in table 6 . the fact that the h@xmath1 follows the shape of the hi overdensity is further confirmation that this is a coherent structure .",
    "if we assume the shock velocity from @xcite , @xmath106 km s@xmath90 and the distance of the clusters to the nucleus , we can calculate the propagation timescale of the shock from the nucleus outwards .",
    "given that the knots are on an average distance of 10 kpc , the shock wave has been propagating from the nucleus since 85 myr ago . however , star formation has been occurring in the nucleus way before then , at least since 300 myr ago .",
    "this is consistent with the kinematic picture first advanced in @xcite : a first interaction with ngc 2444 , provoking the onset of star formation in the nucleus 300 myr ago , and the hi plume observed in @xcite ; and a second interaction @xmath107 myr ago , provoking the emergence of a shock wave which creates a gas overdensity visible in hi @xcite , leading ultimately to a ring of young star forming knots .",
    "these knots were created almost simultaneously , and as we have seen , blows out surrounding pahs in a very short timescale , @xmath108 myr .",
    "models of ring galaxies have shown the emergence of simultaneous star formation due to an expanding shock wave as a consequence of a head - on collision @xcite . however , the timescales and details such as gas distribution , frequency of starbursts , etc . , are strongly dependent on the position and kinematics of the galaxies , and there are no models for the particular case of arp 143",
    ".    the future of star formation in the ring of knots will depend on the gas reservoir .",
    "given the mass of atomic and molecular gas , and the sfr for all the knots , we can calculate the duration of star formation in arp 143 assuming constant sfr .",
    "@xcite found 1.25@xmath109m@xmath99 of atomic gas in arp 143 , and @xmath110m@xmath99 of cold molecular gas .",
    "taking the total gas content and an average sfr of 2.16 m@xmath99 , we calculate that the star formation in arp 143 will last for @xmath111 gyr",
    ". however , the evolution of arp 143 as a ring galaxy is also likely to increase its sfr , meaning that this is an upper limit for the duration of star formation .",
    "these estimates do not , however , take into account the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the intruder galaxy , ngc 2444 , is likely to swing back , and disrupt once more ngc 2445 .",
    "a dynamical model will be extremely useful to predict the future of star formation in this system , and therefore in similar systems at higher redshifts .",
    "mid - infrared observations of arp 143 have been presented in this paper , along with ancillary data including galex uv images .",
    "multiwavelength images from uv to mid - infrared show a bright dusty nucleus surrounded by young star forming knots .",
    "the four main conclusions of this study are the following :    * spectral line maps of the h@xmath1 rotational lines show a ridge of warm h@xmath1 emission that curves between the nucleus and the western knots .",
    "the h@xmath1 line flux related to pah flux is nearly 10 times higher in the ridge than in the nucleus .",
    "the flux ratios between the sum of h@xmath1 s(0 ) and s(2 ) lines over the sum of pah 7.7@xmath7 m and @xmath42 m lines reveal that this h@xmath1 ridge observed in fig .",
    "[ h2fig ] arises from shocked gas behind the wave that provoked the onset of the ring of star forming knots .",
    "this is one of the few cases were this kind of feature is seen . * with the use of photometry and fitting the seds , we improved greatly the age determination of the knots .",
    "the knots in the ring are all very young , varying from 2 - 7.5 myr old and the nucleus is about 500 myr old .",
    "the ring of knots are a product of a shock wave that has been expanding from the nucleus since @xmath107 myr ago , and were formed simultaneously in situ . behind the shock the molecular gas condenses , and it is traced by the h@xmath1 emission ridge .",
    "the improvement of age determination is achieved in this study especially due to the galex fuv and nuv bands , which are crucial to break the age - extinction - metallicity degeneracy . *",
    "the distribution of ages of the knots correlate with the presence of pah emission .",
    "younger 2 - 4 myr old knots are associated with pah emission shells , whereas older 7 - 8 myr knots contain little or no pah emission .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this would be an effect of the ageing of the massive stars created in a single instantaneous burst all over the ring , within a timescale of @xmath104 myr , after which the uv radiation is no longer energetic enough to excite the pahs . *",
    "given the current reservoir of molecular gas , and assuming that the current star formation rate maintains itself constant , the star formation in arp 143 will last for about 2 gyr .",
    "however , as it is very likely that the sfr will increase dramatically , this can only be an upper limit for the duration of the starburst .",

    "<S> we present new mid - infrared ( @xmath0 m ) and ultraviolet ( 1539  2316  ) observations of the interacting galaxy system arp 143 ( ngc 2444/2445 ) from the spitzer space telescope and galex . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> the central nucleus of ngc 2445 is surrounded by knots of massive star - formation in a ring - like structure . </S>",
    "<S> we find unusually strong emission from warm h@xmath1 associated with an expanding shock wave between the nucleus and the western knots . at this ridge , </S>",
    "<S> the flux ratio between h@xmath1 and pah emission is nearly ten times higher than in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> arp 143 is one of the most extreme cases known in that regard . from our multi - wavelength data </S>",
    "<S> we derive a narrow age range of the star - forming knots between 2 myr and 7.5 myr , suggesting that the ring of knots was formed almost simultaneously in response to the shock wave traced by the h@xmath1 emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , the knots can be further subdivided in two age groups : those with an age of 24 myr ( knots a , c , e , and f ) , which are associated with @xmath2 m emission from pahs , and those with an age of 7 - 8 myr ( knots d and g ) , which show little or no @xmath2 m emission shells surrounding them . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this finding to an ageing effect of the massive clusters which , after about 6 myr , no longer excite the pahs surrounding the knots . </S>"
