    "recently there has been renewed discussion @xcite-@xcite about evidence for low energy broad scalar resonances in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 scattering channels . in the approach @xcite on which the present paper is based ,",
    "a need was found for a @xmath4 resonance ( @xmath2 ) at 560 mev and a @xmath5 resonance ( @xmath3 ) around 900 mev .",
    "that approach , motivated by the @xmath12 @xcite approximation to qcd , involves suitably regularized ( near the poles ) tree level diagrams computed from a chiral lagrangian and containing resonances within the energy range of interest .",
    "attention is focussed on the real parts which satisfy crossing symmetry but may in general violate the unitarity bounds . then the unknown parameters ( properties of the scalars ) are adjusted to satisfy the unitarity bounds ( i.e. to agree with experiment ) . in this way an approximate amplitude satisfying both crossing symmetry and unitarity is obtained .",
    "similar results for the scalars have been obtained in different models @xcite-@xcite although there is not unanimous agreement .",
    "these are , after all , attempts to go beyond the energy region where chiral perturbation theory @xcite can provide a practical systematic framework .",
    "now if one accepts a light @xmath2 and @xmath3 and notes the existence of the isovector scalar @xmath0 as well as the @xmath1 there are exactly enough candidates to fill up a nonet of scalars , all lying below 1 gev .",
    "presumably these are not the `` conventional '' p - wave quark - antiquark scalars but something different .",
    "it would then be necessary ( see for example the discussion on page 355 of @xcite ) to have an additional nonet of `` conventional '' heavier scalars .",
    "most mesons fit nicely into a pattern where they have quantum numbers of quark - antiquark ( @xmath7 ) bound states with various orbital angular momenta .",
    "furthermore , their masses and decays are ( roughly ) explained according to a nonet scheme , first proposed by okubo @xcite , known as `` ideal mixing '' .",
    "it has been widely recognized that the low - lying scalars ( at least the well observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) do not appear to fit this usual pattern .",
    "hence jaffe @xcite proposed an attractive scheme , in the context of the mit bag model @xcite , in which the light scalars are taken to have a @xmath6 quark structure ( and zero relative orbital angular momenta ) .",
    "other models explaining light scalars as `` meson - meson '' molecules @xcite or as due to unitarity corrections related to strong meson - meson interactions @xcite also involve four quarks at the microscopic level and may possibly be related .",
    "our concern in the present paper is to study the nonet structure of the light scalars based on the approach of @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there , an effective chiral lagrangian treatment was used . in such a treatment ,",
    "only the @xmath13 flavor properties of the scalars are relevant @xcite . at this level",
    ", one would not expect any difference in the formulation of our model since both okubo s model and jaffe s model use nonets with the same @xmath13 flavor transformation properties .",
    "in fact , we shall show ( in section ii ) that the effective lagrangian defining ideal mixing in okubo s scheme has two `` solutions '' .",
    "the one he choses explains the light vector mesons with a natural quark - antiquark structure .",
    "the other solution is identical to jaffe s model of the scalars .",
    "we note that it may be formally regarded as having a dual - quark dual - antiquark structure , where the dual quark is actually an anti - diquark .",
    "the initial appearance is that the four masses of the light nonet candidates obey the ordering relation [ eq .",
    "( [ new - nonet - hierarchy ] ) below ] of the dual ideal mixing picture but not the more stringent requirement of this picture eq .",
    "( [ sum - rule - b ] ) .",
    "furthermore the decay @xmath14 is experimentally observed but is predicted to vanish according to ideal mixing .",
    "thus , it is necessary to consider some corrections to the ideal mixing model .",
    "when such correction terms are added [ to yield a structure like eq .",
    "( [ mixing - mass - lag ] ) ] the new model actually displays two different solutions for the particle eigenstates corresponding to a given scalar mass spectrum ( see the discussion in section iii ) so it becomes unclear as to whether the ordinary or the dual ideal mixing picture is more nearly correct . in order to resolve this question the predictions for the scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants",
    "are first computed for each of these two solutions .",
    "the five coupling constants needed for @xmath15 scattering are found to depend on only two parameters - a and b in eq .",
    "( [ interactions ] ) .",
    "then ( see section iv ) the @xmath5 scattering is recalculated taking these two parameters as quantities to be fit .",
    "however it turns out that both solutions yield equally probable fits to the @xmath5 scattering amplitudes .",
    "finally , the question is resolved by noting that only one of the two solution sets gives results which could be compatible with the previous @xcite @xmath4 scattering analysis and with the @xmath14 decay rate .",
    "the favored solution is characterized by a scalar @xmath16 mixing angle which is closer to the dual form of ideal mixing than to the usual form . using a convention [ see eq.([mixing - convention ] ) ] where an angle @xmath17 means dual ideal mixing and @xmath18 means conventional ideal mixing , the favored solution has @xmath19 .",
    "it should be noted that this result is based on an analysis of scalar coupling constants which are related to each other `` kinematically '' but which are related to experiment through `` dynamical '' models of @xmath5 and @xmath4 scattering .",
    "some technical details are put in three appendixes .",
    "appendix a contains a brief discussion of some key features of the @xmath6 scalars as expected in the quark model .",
    "appendix b shows how the needed terms of the lagrangian including the scalar nonet may be presented in chiral covariant form .",
    "finally appendix c contains a list of the various scalar - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling constants and their relations to the parameters of our lagrangian and to the scalar and pseudoscalar mixing angles .",
    "for orientation , it may be useful to start off by paraphrasing okubo s classic discussion @xcite of the `` ideal mixing '' of a meson nonet field , which we denote as the @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 . in our case",
    "the field will have @xmath22 rather than @xmath23 as in the original case .",
    "the notation is such that a lower index transforms under flavor @xmath13 in the same way as a quark while an upper index transforms in the same way as an antiquark . in this discussion",
    "it is not strictly necessary to mention the quark substructure of n - only its flavor transformation property will be of relevance .",
    "this lack of specificity turns out to be an advantage for our present purpose .",
    "the `` ideal mixing '' model may be defined by the following mass terms of an effective lagrangian density : @xmath24 where a and b are real constants while @xmath25 is the `` spurion matrix '' @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the ratio of strange to non - strange quark masses in the usual interpretation .",
    "iso - spin invariance is being assumed .",
    "the names of the scalar particles with non - trivial quantum numbers are : @xmath28,\\ ] ] with @xmath29 .",
    "there are two iso - singlet states : the combination @xmath30 is an @xmath13 singlet while @xmath31 belongs to an @xmath13 octet .",
    "these will in general mix with each other when @xmath13 is broken . diagonalizing the fields in eq .",
    "( [ mass - lag ] ) yields the diagonal ( ideally mixed ) states @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "now it is easy to read off the particle masses from eq .",
    "( [ mass - lag ] ) in terms of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath27 .",
    "this information is conveniently described by the two sum rules : @xmath36 @xmath37 there are two characteristically different kinds of solutions , depending on whether both sides of eq .",
    "( [ sum - rule - b ] ) are positive or negative .",
    "okubo s original scheme amounts to the choice that both sides of eq .",
    "( [ sum - rule - b ] ) are negative .",
    "then    @xmath38    this is consistent with a quark model interpretation of the composite nonet field : @xmath39 identifying @xmath40 .",
    "specifically , eq . (",
    "[ conventional ] ) states that @xmath33 is composed of one strange quark and one strange antiquark , @xmath3 of one non - strange quark and one strange antiquark while @xmath41 and @xmath42 have zero strange content .",
    "thus the ordering in eq .",
    "( [ nonet - hierarchy ] ) naturally follows if the strange quark is heavier than the non - strange quark , as has been well established .",
    "this ideal mixing picture works well for the vector mesons ( with the reidentifications @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and reasonably well for most of the other observed meson multiplets ( see page 98 of @xcite ) .",
    "the exceptions are the low - lying @xmath47 and @xmath48 nonets .",
    "it is generally accepted that the deviation of the @xmath47 nonet from this picture can be understood from the special connection of the pseudoscalar flavor singlet with the @xmath49 anomaly of qcd .",
    "the case of the @xmath48 nonet has been less clear , in part because the existence of the scalar states needed to fill up a low - lying nonet has been difficult to establish .",
    "now a long time ago , jaffe @xcite suggested that the low - lying scalars might have a quark substructure of the form @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "this model can be put in the identical form as our previous discussion of eqs .",
    "( [ mass - lag ] ) - ( [ sum - rule - b ] ) by introducing the `` dual '' flavor quarks ( actually diquarks ) : @xmath50 wherein it should be noted that the quark fields are anticommuting quantities .",

    "furthermore it is seen that the ordering in eq .",

    "( [ mass - lag ] ) to yield @xmath55 the states @xmath56 and @xmath33 will no longer be diagonal",
    ". the physical states will be some linear combination of these .",
    "this `` non - ideally mixed '' situation will be seen to be required in order to explain the experimental pattern of scalar decay modes .",
    "we would like to stress that , in the effective lagrangian approach , no more than the assumption of mass terms like ( [ mixing - mass - lag ] ) is required ; it is not necessary to assume a particular quark substructure for @xmath57 .",
    "that field may represent a structure like ( [ conventional ] ) , one like ( [ multiquark - nonet ] ) , a linear combination of these or something more complicated . of course , it is still interesting to ask whether the resulting predictions are closer to those resulting from ( [ multiquark - nonet ] ) or from ( [ conventional ] ) .",
    "a natural question concerns the plausibility of the `` dual '' ansatz in eq .",

    "( [ new - nonet - hierarchy ] ) .",
    "jaffe @xcite showed that there is a dynamical basis for such an ansatz in the mit bag model @xcite .",

    "the chiral aspect of our model is largely irrelevant to the discussion in the present paper but , for completeness , will be briefly treated in appendix b.    notice that the first term of ( [ interactions ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath112 thus , if desired , the complicated looking first term of ( [ interactions ] ) may be eliminated in favor of the most standard form @xmath113 .",
    "our motivation for presenting it in the way shown is that , by itself , the first term of ( [ interactions ] ) predicts zero coupling constants for both @xmath114 and @xmath115 when the `` dual '' ideal mixing identifications , @xmath53 and @xmath116 , are made .",
    "this is in agreement with jaffe s picture ( see section vb of @xcite ) of the dominant scalar decays arising as the `` falling apart '' or `` quark rearrangement '' of their constituents .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ multiquark - nonet ] ) that @xmath33 can not fall apart into @xmath117 and that @xmath56 can not fall apart into @xmath4 .",
    "of course @xmath118 must be non - zero because @xmath1 is observed in @xmath4 scattering .",

    "our model contains two sources for @xmath122 : the deviation from ideal mixing due to the @xmath78 and @xmath79 terms in ( [ mixing - mass - lag ] ) and also the presence of more than one term in ( [ interactions ] ) .",
    "note again that the use of ( [ mixing - mass - lag ] ) and ( [ interactions ] ) does not require us to make any commitment as to the quark substructure of @xmath57 .",
    "using isotopic spin invariance , the trilinear @xmath123 interaction resulting from ( [ interactions ] ) must have the form    @xmath124    where the @xmath125 s are the coupling constants .",
