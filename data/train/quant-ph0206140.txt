    "entanglement is no doubt an intriguing property of composite quantum systems .",
    "it is a correlation that is stronger than any classical correlation .",
    "it is found that entanglement is not only of interests in the interpretation of the foundation of quantum mechanics , but also a resource useful in quantum information processing and quantum computation .",
    "although the theory of entanglement is widely developed in the systems of distinguishable particles , only very recently the entanglement properties in identical particle systems began to attract much attention@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in the fields of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "quite recently , it is realized that applying the theory of entanglement developed in quantum information science to the field of condensed matter physics may give us new insight in these problems , especially the abundant entanglement properties of ground state wave function and the wave functions related to the quantum phase transitions@xcite@xcite .",
    "some systems have already been extensively studied , such as the models of heissenberg spin chain@xcite and harmonic chain@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that these systems are all related to the crystal lattice , thus the entanglement can be calculated using the side entropy suggested by zanardi@xcite or just using the measure of entanglement suggested by the entanglement theory of distinguishable particle systems by taking account of the fact that each site can be viewed as one `` party '' in quantum information science .",
    "it is noticed that the fractional quantum hall liquid is a kind of strongly correlated quantum fluid , in which quantum correlation plays an essential role@xcite . as the external magnetic field perpendicular to the two - dimensional election gas increases , the hall conductance as well as the filling factor jumps from one value to another .",
    "correspondingly , a change of the wave function of the system takes place .",
    "it is well - known that the fractional quantum hall effect with the filling fractions @xmath0 has been explained by laughlin@xcite . besides these states",
    ", the quantum hall liquid possesses an extremely rich internal structure , which is classified in terms of so - called k - matrix@xcite .",
    "so far it is clear that the fractional quantum hall system experiences quantum phase transition , and some characters of one fractional quantum hall state are essentially different from those of another state . seeking some order or index to describe",
    "these essential characters can facilitate further understanding of the quantum phase transition .",
    "many work has been done along this direction@xcite .",
    "recently it is noticed that the states in fractional quantum hall liquid have very sophisticated entanglement properties @xcite , and different states may have different entanglement properties .",
    "thus it attracts our attention to apply the theory of entanglement developed in quantum information science to investigate the entanglement properties in this system .",
    "however , since there is no longer any site in the liquid , at first sight it seems that we can not use the entanglement measure of distinguishable particle systems to calculate the entanglement of this system .",
    "surprisingly , it is found by pakauskas and you@xcite that the von neumann entropy of the reduced single particle density matrix remains to be a good entanglement measure for two identical particles , which is a natural extension of the entanglement measure of distinguishable particles.thus , this entanglement measure of identical particles is sufficient to meet our need here .",
    "in this paper we study the entanglement properties of the laughlin wave function and the wave functions that are generated by the k - matrix of quantum hall liquid .",
    "first in section 2 we will explain the meaning of the entanglement measure of indistinguishable fermions that is proposed by pakauskas and you , and further point out the relationship between this measure and the measure used in the distinguishable particle systems .",
    "we will find that a slight modification is needed in pakauskas and you s measure .",
    "then we calculate the entanglement of the laughlin wave function and the wave functions that are generated by the k - matrix in the simplest case that the particle number @xmath1 is @xmath2 in section 2 using the slightly modified entanglement measure of indistinguishable fermions . in section 3",
    "the more sophisticated case with the particle number lager than @xmath2 is considered.some discussions about our results will be given in section 4 .",
    "the first entanglement measure of indistinguishable fermions is introduced by j.schliemann et .",
    "@xcite , they claimed that the concept of separablility of a state in composite systems of fermions should be defined in terms of that the state can be expressed in the form of a single slater determinant . in @xcite , they find that the wave function of two fermions can be written in the following standard form    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the orthonormal basis of single particle space .",
    "following this idea , they defined an entanglement measure of two fermions as follows    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the dual state of @xmath8.it can be verified that @xmath9 if and only if @xmath8 can be expressed in the form of a single slater determinant and @xmath10 is a smooth function ranging from @xmath9 for the separable state to @xmath11 for the maximum correlated state .    later , pakauskas and you@xcite suggested another entanglement measure for two fermions.they found that the von neumann entropy of the reduced single particle density matrix remains to be a good entanglement measure for two identical particles.thus , for the state ( 1 ) , the entanglement can be calculated as    @xmath12=-1n2 - 4\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{\\leq{n/2}}|z_{k}/2|^{2}ln(|z_{k}/2|^{2})\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the dimension of the single particle space .",
    "@xmath14 is also a smooth function ranging from @xmath15 for the separable state to @xmath16 for the maximum correlated state , where @xmath17 is the maximal even number less or equal to @xmath13 .",
    "however , a problem with this measure still remains , for the un - correlated two - fermion state gives @xmath15 rather than @xmath18 .",
    "we point out here that this problem can be easily understood because it is noticed that the extra @xmath19 is just the entanglement contained in the antisymmetry of the wave function in the first quantized representation of two identical fermions .",
    "it is already known that this extra entanglement is of no use in quantum information processing . since in identical particle systems",
    "it is important to find the entanglement beyond that involved in the ( anti)symmetry induced by quantum statistics , we need to get rid of this extra @xmath19 , i.e. this entanglement measure needs a slight modification    @xmath20-ln2=-21n2 - 4\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{\\leq{n/2}}|z_{k}/2|^{2}ln(|z_{k}/2|^{2})\\ ] ]    it must be emphasized that although this modification is quite slight , it is very important in the sense that this modification enables us to obtain the same value of entanglement measure when the system of identical particles is reduced to a system of distinguishable particles . to be more concrete ,",
    "consider the following state of two qubits written in the form of the schmidt decomposition    @xmath21    whose second quantized counterpart is @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "+ it is easy to get @xmath24    this is in accordance with the von neumann entropy of two - qubit state(5 ) .",
    "it is also a very easy task to show that when the two fermions are distinguishable , what the modified entanglement measure(4 ) give us is just the von neumann entropy . in this sense",
    "we can say the modified entanglement measure(4 ) is the measure suitable for two - fermion systems , either identical or distinguishable .",
    "it is also noticed that to calculate entanglement of two fermions with eq(4 ) has another three advantages .",
    "first , we can see from eq(4 ) the close relationship between this measure and the measure used in the distinguishable particle systems .",
    "second , we can either calculate this measure directly from the first quantized representation using the skills developed to calculate the entanglement measure of distinguishable particles or from the second quantized representation by just calculating the one particle density matrix and diagnosing it .",
    "third , this measure can be extended to multi - particle case naturally to calculate the entanglement between one - particle and the other particles in the system with a slight modification    @xmath25-lnn\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the particle number .",
    "it is noticed that the entanglement measure(2 ) can not be directly extended to multi - particle case@xcite .",
    "although in multi - particle case this measure can not give us all the entanglement properties of the state , we can get at least some information about the entanglement properties of the state .",
    "in fact it is well - known that in both the distinguishable and identical particle case the question of quantify the multi - particle entanglement is still open .",
    "considered all in all , we will use eq(4 ) and eq(5 ) to explore the entanglement properties in quantum hall liquid .",
    "the laughlin wave function for a quantum hall liquid with filling factor @xmath27 reads    @xmath28    where @xmath29s are complex coordinates of the electrons and @xmath30 is a positive odd number .",
    "it is already known that the case @xmath31 corresponds to the integer quantum hall effect , where the laughlin wave function is just a single slater determinant , i. e.    @xmath32    thus @xmath33 is separable",
    ".    however , when @xmath34 , @xmath35 can not be expressed in the form of a single slater determinant , i.e. it is entangled . in order to explore the entanglement properties of laughlin wave function in the case @xmath36 , we need to calculate the amount of entanglement contained in these functions .",
    "first , we consider the simplest case that the particle number @xmath26 , then the laughlin wave function will be    @xmath37     + obviously , to calculate the measure of entanglement(4 ) from the first quantization point of view is a very difficult task , for this is a problem concerning continuous variable entanglement which always can not be obtained analytically .",
    "then we need to tackle this problem from the second quantization point of view . fortunately",
    ", if the one particle space is chosen appropriately , the calculation can be done within a finite dimensional space.it is noticed that these functions in the lowest landau level with different angular momentum are written as :    @xmath38    the family of functions @xmath39 form an orthogonal basis of one particle space , where @xmath40 is the normalization factor , i.e.    @xmath41    and @xmath42 .",
    "define a set of creation operators @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 by    @xmath45     + thus we can rewrite @xmath35 in the second quantized form as    @xmath46a_{m - k}^{\\dag}a_{k}^{\\dag}|0\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\                      & = & 2^{-\\frac{m-1}{2}}\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{(m-1)/2}\\sqrt{c_{m}^{k}}a_{m - k}^{\\dag}a_{k}^{\\dag}|0\\rangle      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to find that @xmath47 in eq(12 ) has the form of the slater decomposition ( 1 ) , thus we can calculate the entanglement of @xmath47 directly using formula(4 ) :    @xmath48    and the variation of @xmath49 with @xmath50 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we can see from figure 1 that the entanglement increases with @xmath30 increasing .",
    "we know that a quasihole excitation above @xmath51 is described by @xmath52 .",
    "these quasiholes can form new quantum fluid in the second level , leading to more complicated filling fraction , such as @xmath53 .",
    "it is well - known that there are hierarchical fractional quantum hall states .",
    "the wave functions of such states can be constructed with the help of k - matrix@xcite . as an example , the state characterized by using @xmath54 has a filling fraction @xmath55 , and is described by the generalized laughlin wave function :    @xmath56    physically , these states have two quasiholes above the @xmath57 state , and then these quasiholes form quantum hall liquid with @xmath58 . integrating over the coordinates of the quasiholes ,",
    "one obtains a new dancing pattern of these electrons which is different from that of @xmath51 .",
    "naturally , it leads to a change of the entanglement property .",
    "it is found that    @xmath59    thus @xmath60 can be rewritten as :    @xmath61    and in the second quantized form the normalized state vector of @xmath60 reads :    @xmath62a_{m - k+2}^{\\dag}a_{k}^{\\dag}|0\\rangle\\ ] ]     + obviously , @xmath63 in eq(17 ) also has the form of the slater decomposition(1 ) , thus we can calculate the entanglement of @xmath47 directly using formula(4 ) :    @xmath64    and the variation of @xmath49 with @xmath50 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we can see from figure 1 that the entanglement also increases when @xmath30 is increasing . comparing the two curves in figure 1 we can find that for each @xmath30 , @xmath65 .",
    "this fact can be understood by noting that adding a hierarchical structure will result in the increase of quantum entanglement .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath66 .",
    "this can also be found from their explicit expression , i. e.    @xmath67    @xmath68",
    "now we turn to the much more difficult case @xmath69 .",
    "as mentioned above , we can only get some information of the entanglement between one particle and other particles using eq(5 ) .",
    "we again use second quantized representation to calculate the entanglement of this special kind of multi - particle states .    take @xmath70 laughlin wave function for example    @xmath71    we have    @xmath72-ln3\\ ] ]",
    "the second quantized form of @xmath73 is    @xmath74    it is noted for @xmath73 , the single - particle density matrix(up to a normalization factor ) @xmath75 has no off - diagonal elements , thus @xmath76 can easily be calculated from the form of @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath77 is a homogeneous polynomial of @xmath78 , @xmath79and@xmath80 apart from an exponential factor , there will be no off - diagonal elements of the single - particle density matrix , for arbitrary positive odd value of @xmath30 .",
    "this is also true for any particle number @xmath1 .",
    "this fact makes the calculation of @xmath81 much easier .",
    "our result for the @xmath70 case is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 2 that @xmath81also increases when @xmath30 is increasing .",
    "similar things happen in the calculation of @xmath81 of a state that is generated by the same kind of k - matrix mentioned above , since in these wave functions the polynomial is also homogeneous .",
    "take @xmath70 for example    @xmath82    since    @xmath83    we get    @xmath84    which is also a homogeneous polynomial of @xmath78 , @xmath79and@xmath80 apart from an exponential factor .",
    "thus the calculation of @xmath81 of this kind of wave functions is also quite easy .",
    "our result for @xmath70 case is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 2 that @xmath81also increases when @xmath30 is increasing .",
    "however , we can see that at this time @xmath85 is no longer equal to @xmath86 .",
    "comparing the two curves in figure 2 we can find that for each @xmath30 , the relation @xmath87 still holds .",
    "the results of @xmath26 and @xmath70 cases for the laughlin wave function are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it can be seen that the amount of entanglement between one electron and the other electrons increases with the electron number n. and the k - matrix case is shown in figure 4 . however , this case is quite sophisticated since the amount of entanglement between one electron and the other electrons only increases with the electron number n besides the case @xmath88 .",
    "now we turn to another kind of dancing patterns of these strongly correlated electrons .",
    "we have already shown that the @xmath89 state is a separable state , while if there exists some quasihole excitation above it , and then these quasiholes form a laughlin - type state with filling fraction @xmath90 , where @xmath30 is an odd integer .",
    "it will result in entanglement between electrons .",
    "the k - matrix is written as @xmath91 , and the corresponding filling fractions are @xmath92 .",
    "thus the wave functions associated with this k - matrix take the form(take the case @xmath93 for example ) :    @xmath94    using the method above we can also get some information of the entanglement properties these wave functions . for @xmath95 ,",
    "our result is shown in figure 5 .",
    "it is similar to that of figure 1 , this is consistent with the particle - hole duality picture in quantum hall liquid .",
    "the eventually vanishing of @xmath96 is due to the effect of finite number of electrons .",
    "it is easy to find that when @xmath97    @xmath98    this fact means that the @xmath99 @xmath1-electron system can not support a laughlin type wave function of quasiholes when @xmath30 is larger than @xmath100 .",
    "we calculated the entanglement of the laughlin wave function and the wave functions that are generated by the k - matrix using the modified entanglement measure of indistinguishable fermions that is first proposed by pakauskas and you@xcite through the second quantized approach in this paper .",
    "it is noticed that the fractional quantum hall effect occurs when the external magnetic field is sufficiently high , the degeneracy of the lowest landau level is large enough that the problem can be treated in the subspace of lowest landau level .",
    "this leads to the fact that the wave function can be expressed in an elegant form which is an analytical homogeneous polynomial of its arguments apart from a gaussian factor , and results in a clean second quantized form without any off - diagonal elements .",
    "this property enables us to write down the entanglement measure in an analytical way .",
    "our result shows that for both kinds of wave functions , the amount of entanglement contained in each kind of wave function increases with the increase of the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "however , since it is well - known that the filling fraction changes dramatically with the increase of external magnetic field @xmath101 , the entanglement properties is indeed very sophisticated in the system of quantum hall liquid .",
    "it is expected that our results and methods can shed light on further studies of quantum orders in quantum hall liquid and other physical systems .",
