    "the strangeness meson photoproduction off the nucleon target is one of the most well - studied experimental and theoretical subjects to reveal the hadron production mechanisms and its internal structures , in terms of the strange degrees of freedom , breaking the flavor su(3 ) symmetry explicitly .",
    "together with the recent high - energy photon beam developments in the experimental facilities , such as lpes2 at spring-8 and clas12 at jefferson laboratory  @xcite , higher - mass strange meson - baryon photoproducitons must be an important subject to be addressed theoretically for future studies on those reaction processes . in the previous works  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 photoproduction was investigated , the born approximation being used with the regge contributions . in comparison with the preliminary experimental data",
    "@xcite , the theory reproduced the data qualitatively well , but the theoretical cross - section strength was underestimated in the vicinity of the @xmath4 . in the present talk ,",
    "we want to report our recent study to explain this discrepancy observed in the previous work .",
    "based on the theoretical framework as employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we include the nucleon resonances in the @xmath7-channel baryon - pole contribution . as for the nucleon resonances",
    "@xmath8 , we take into account nine of them , i.e. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , in a full relativistic manner .",
    "we start with explaining the theoretical framework briefly and represent the important numerical results in our study .",
    "we note that the nucleon resonances are carefully taken into account in a full - relativistic manner , in addition to the born diagrams , @xmath18 and @xmath19 meson - exchanges in the @xmath20 channel , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 hyperon exchanges in the @xmath23 channel , which were already employed in ref .",
    "all the effective interaction vertices for the nucleon resonances are taken from ref .",
    "for instance , the invariant amplitudes for the spin-@xmath24 and spin-@xmath25 resonance contributions in the @xmath7 channel can be written as follows : @xmath26 \\cr       & & \\frac{ie_q\\mu_{n^*}}{2m_n}\\gamma^{\\mp}(\\not{k_1}+\\not{p_1}+m_{n^ * } ) \\gamma^{\\mp}\\sigma^{\\mu{i}}k_{1i}u_n(p_1){\\varepsilon}_{\\mu}(k_1 ) , \\cr \\mathcal { m}_{n^*}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}^\\pm \\right)&= & \\frac{g_{{k^*}n^*\\lambda}}{s - m_{n^*}^2 } { \\varepsilon}_{\\nu}^*(k_2){\\bar    u}_{\\lambda}(p_2)({k_2^\\beta}g^{{\\nu}i}-k_2^ig^{\\nu\\beta } )   \\frac{e_q}{2m_{k^*}}\\gamma_i^{\\pm}\\delta_{\\beta\\alpha }           \\cr                                   & & \\left[\\frac{\\mu_{n^*}}{2m_n}\\gamma_j\\,\\mp\\,\\frac{\\bar \\mu_{n^ * } } { 4m_n^2}p_{1j } \\right]\\gamma^{\\pm}({k_1^\\alpha}g^{{\\mu}j}-{k_1^j } g^{\\mu\\alpha})u_n(p_1){\\varepsilon}_{\\mu}(k_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 stand for the @xmath28 momenta and @xmath29 for the helicity amplitude .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the strong vector and tensor coupling strengths , respectively .",
    "the polarization vectors for the photon and @xmath32 are assigned as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 controls the parity of the relevant resonances in the following way : @xmath36 relevant parameters for the resonances are estimated using the experimental and theoretical information  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the total cross section for the present reaction process , i.e. @xmath37 . the numerical results are drawn separately for the cases including the @xmath2 ( left ) and @xmath3 ( right ) , varying the coupling constants @xmath30 . as shown in the figure , the cross - section enhancement is observed in the vicinity of the threshold region , if we choose the strong coupling strengths as @xmath38 .",
    "we verified that other nucleon resonances are not so effective to interpret the discrepancy .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the present work , we have studied the @xmath39 photoproduction theoretically , employing the tree - level born approximation and nucleon - resonance contributions below the @xmath4 . among the nucleon resonances , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 play a dominant role to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "it also turns out that other @xmath8 contributions are not so effective to improve the theoretical results .",
    "we note that the nucleon resonances beyond the @xmath4 may contribute to the threshold enhancement , especially due to the @xmath40 , since the @xmath4 for the present reaction process is about @xmath41 mev .",
