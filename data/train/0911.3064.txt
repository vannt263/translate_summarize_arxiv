    "soft x - rays are efficiently scattered at small angles by interstellar dust grains .",
    "this effect , as predicted by @xcite and observationally confirmed by @xcite , is responsible for the presence of x - ray scattering halos around several bright x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray scattering cross section depends on the grain properties , and the observed radial distribution of the photons scattered in the halo also depends on the positions of the scattering grains along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , the study of the energy - dependent radial profile of the x - ray halos gives useful information on the dust grain size , composition , and spatial distribution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "scattered x - rays are delayed with respect to direct ones , owing to their longer path length from the source to the observer . in the case of variable sources , these delays give rise to time - dependent effects on the halos properties , that can be used , if the dust spatial distribution is known , to constrain the source distance @xcite .",
    "this method was applied for the first time to constrain the distance of the x - ray binary cyg  x-3 @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation occurs when the dust is concentrated only in a thin layer and the x - ray emission has a short duration . in this case",
    "the halo appears as a x - ray ring with increasing radius , because only the photons scattered at a well determined angle are detected at a given time .",
    "such `` expanding rings '' ( or `` light echoes '' ) have been observed to date in a handful of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and by measuring their expansion rate it has been possible to derive accurate distances of galactic dust clouds ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here we report on the discovery of dust scattering rings around the galactic source  @xcite",
    ".  belongs to the small class of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , which , together with the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are thought to be magnetars , i.e. isolated neutron stars powered by the energy stored in their extremely strong magnetic field ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these sources are characterized by the sporadic emission of very bright , short bursts , reaching peak luminosities above @xmath110@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 in the extreme cases known as giant flares . in 2008 october",
    "emitted several short bursts and its x - ray flux increased significantly @xcite .",
    "no further bursts were reported until 2009 january 22 , when the source started a new period of much stronger bursting activity @xcite .",
    "this prompted the follow - up x - ray observations that led to the discovery of the three dust scattering rings discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review some properties of the x - ray dust scattering process that will be used in our analysis of the  and   observations described in section 3 . from the expansion rate of the three dust rings we could establish that they originate from the scattering of the same event in three dust layers at different distances ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "while this result is independent on the dust properties , the estimate of the distance by modeling the rings intensity ( section 4.2 ) requires the knowledge of the x - ray scattering differential cross section , hence it depends on the assumed properties of the dust .",
    "we found that only a subset of the different dust models that we explored can give satisfactory fits ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "the possible distances for  from the best - fitting models span a large range of values ( section 5.2 ) , but this can be restricted based on independent information on the gas distribution in the galaxy ( section 5.3 ) .",
    "the theory of x - ray scattering by interstellar dust grains has been reviewed in several articles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "here we remind only a few properties that are relevant to our analysis of the dust scattering rings detected around .",
    "let us consider a source at distance @xmath8 emitting a short burst of x - ray radiation that is scattered by a thin layer of dust at distance @xmath9 .",
    "the photons scattered at larger angles reach the observer later because of their longer optical path .",
    "thus the scattering halo appears as a narrow ring centered at the source position and with angular size increasing with time . considering that the involved angles are small",
    "( typically less than 10 arcmin ) , the ring angular radius @xmath10 is easily derived by simple geometrical considerations giving : @xmath11^{1/2 } \\label{theta}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the speed of light and @xmath14 is the time at which unscattered photons are detected ( in the following called burst time ) .",
    "the photons scattering angle @xmath15 is related to the ring size by : @xmath16 if the dust is in our galaxy and the source is at cosmological distances , as in the case of grbs , these relations simplify to @xmath17^{1/2 } $ ] and @xmath18 , thus the dust distance can be directly derived only from the ring expansion rate . for galactic sources , instead ,",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be obtained only if the parameter @xmath19 is independently measured .",
    "this can be done with an analysis of the intensity evolution of the rings as a function of the energy and of the ring radius .",
    "in fact , the scattering differential cross - section depends on the grain size and composition , and it rapidly decreases with energy and scattering angle ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , at any given energy , the ring intensity decrease with the scattering angle is univocally determined by the dust composition and grain size distribution .",
    "since the observed ring radius is related to the scattering angle by equation [ [ thetacirca ] ] , the parameter @xmath19 , and therefore the distance of the source and of the dust layer , can be obtained by fitting the energy - resolved intensity decay of an expanding ring at different times .",
    "this method is analogous to the analysis of the halo profiles of persistent x - ray sources ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but it has the advantage that the dust distribution along the line of sight is known and the radiation scattered by each dust cloud can be analyzed separately .    for the following analysis it is useful to define an expansion coefficient @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "equation [ [ theta ] ] can then be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is in arcmin , @xmath23 in days , and @xmath8 in kiloparsecs .",
    "assuming the rayleigh - gans approximation @xcite , the single - scattering halo profile ( expressed in erg @xmath3 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7 ) predicted for a burst of fluence @xmath24 ( in erg @xmath3 kev@xmath7 ) scattered by grains with size distribution @xmath25 ( dust grains with radius @xmath26 per hydrogen atom ) is @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hydrogen column density in the dust cloud , @xmath29 @xmath30 is the dust scattering cross - section , @xmath31 is the density ( in g @xmath32 ) of each dust component and @xmath33 is the form factor . in our case",
    "the rayleigh - gans approximation is appropriate , since in the following analysis this formula will be applied in the energy range where it is valid ( @xmath34 kev ) . on the other hand , a gaussian approximation of the form factor is often adopted , but we used the exact formula for spherical uncoated grains ( equations [ 2.4 ] and [ 2.5 ] in @xcite ) , since we have verified that in our case the approximation is not accurate enough at large angles and at the highest energies .",
    "many dust models , with different compositions and grain size distributions , have been proposed and tested against multiwavelength observational data .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2001 , wd01 ) derived a model of dust composed of carbonaceous grains ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at the smallest sizes and graphite for larger grains , which are the responsible for the scattering at x - rays ) and amorphous silicate grains .",
    "@xcite proposed 15 dust models , characterized by different abundances of the interstellar medium ( b stars , f and g stars , or solar ) , by the possible presence of composite dust ( in addition to bare grains ) and by the form of the bare carbon ( graphite , amorphous carbon , or no carbon ) . besides the wd01 model and the 15 models of @xcite",
    ", we also tried a simple idealized model , consisting of a single component of dust grains with a power - law size distribution @xmath35 , defined between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the 2009 january outburst of  was extensively followed by the  satellite with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) operated either in windowed timing ( wt ) mode , characterized by a high time resolution but only mono - dimensional ( 1d ) imaging , or in photon counting ( pc ) mode , where bi - dimensional ( 2d ) imaging of the 10@xmath38 radius field of view is available .",
    "we used 5 observations in wt mode and 7 observations in pc mode ( see table  [ obs ] ) .",
    "after 2009 january 30 the rings became too dim to be detected by the /xrt instrument .",
    "we therefore requested a 50 ks long observation with , that was performed on 2009 february 34 and allowed us to detect the faint rings thanks to the great sensitivity and large field of view of the epic instrument .",

    "we first cleaned the data by excluding time intervals during which bright bursts from  were detected .",
    "we limited the analysis of the xrt data to the 16 kev energy range , where the rings are significantly detected . in order to avoid contamination by spatially variable emission lines in the instrumental background ,",
    "the analysis of the pn and mos data was restricted to the 1.66 kev and 1.96 kev range , respectively . in epic",
    ", we removed the point sources detected in the field and the out - of - time pn events from the bright central source . for each data set we extracted a radial profile centered at the position of , as derived with a standard centroid search algorithm in each observation .",
    "the number of counts in each radial bin was normalized to the enclosed area and divided by the corresponding average exposure time derived from the exposure map , in order to correct the observed profile for the vignetting , the dead detector areas , and the excluded regions .",

    "the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of /xrt @xcite and /epic @xcite are well modeled by a king profile .",
    "we verified through simulations that the radial profile of a thin ring broadened by a psf with a king profile is well fit by a lorentzian function .",
    "since the rings slightly expand during each observation , their profile is expected to be asymmetric , but we verified that a fit with a lorentzian is still a good approximation due to the relatively short duration of our observations .",

    "the angular size of the three rings , as obtained from the best - fit values of the lorentzian centroids , is plotted as a function of time in figure  [ exp ] .",
    "we used equation [ [ thetasimp ] ] to fit the size evolution of the three rings , with @xmath39 and @xmath14 as free parameters , and obtained good @xmath40 values ( 6.2/6 degrees of freedom [ dof ] , 5.1/6 dof and 0.8/6 dof ) .",
    "the best - fit t@xmath41 values for the three rings resulted consistent with a single burst time , while three significantly different values for @xmath39 were found .",
    "this means that the rings were produced by the scattering of the same burst ( or of a series of bursts occurring within a short time interval ) by three dust layers at different distances .",
    "the derived t@xmath41 values are compatible with the short time interval from 6:43 to 6:51 ut of 2009 january 22 , in which the highest bursting activity was seen during a long , uninterrupted observation obtained with the anti - coincidence shield ( acs ) of the spectrometer on  ( spi ) instrument @xcite . among the several tens of short bursts seen in this interval ,",
    "two events were outstanding for their exceptional brightness : a burst at 6:45:14 ut lasting @xmath11.5 s and a longer event that occurred at 6:48:04 ut .",
    "the latter burst consisted of an initial bright spike , lasting 0.3 s , followed by a tail pulsed at the 2.1 s rotation period of . and therefore can not be the origin of the x - ray rings . ]",
    "both events saturated the acs and the first one saturated also the detector on the _ rhessi _ satellite @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not possible to establish which of the two bursts had a higher fluence in the soft x - ray range and caused the scattering rings . due to the small time delay between these two events ,",
    "all our analysis and results of the next section do not depend significantly on which of these burst was the origin of the rings ( in fact it is also possible that both events contributed to the observed scattered x - rays ) . in the following we will assume that the observed rings were produced by the first burst and define @xmath42 mjd = 2009 january 22 at 6:45:14 ut .",
    "the fits result gave @xmath43 s , @xmath44 s , and @xmath45 s ( all the errors are at 1 @xmath46 ) .",

    "we describe our analysis of the energy - dependent halo profiles , i.e. the spectra @xmath53 of the three rings at the different angles @xmath22 from the source direction .",
    "in fact , having already determined the expansion rate , for any given dust scattering model , @xmath53 depends only on the source distance , column density @xmath28 , and fluence @xmath54 of the primary radiation ( see equation [ ithetae ] ) . by simultaneously fitting @xmath53 for the three rings we will derive some information on these quantities .    while the relative optical depth of the three dust layers is set by the relative intensity of the three rings , their absolute values are unknown because the burst fluence @xmath54 in the soft x - ray band was not directly measured . in the following analysis we fixed the column density of the dust cloud producing the innermost and brightest ring at @xmath55 @xmath3 .",
    "this value was chosen considering that the total @xmath28 along the line of sight derived from the x - ray spectrum of  is @xmath1@xmath56 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the burst fluence @xmath54 that we will derive from the fits of @xmath53 depends on the assumed value @xmath57 .",
    "also the column densities obtained for the two other clouds , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , will be relative to @xmath57 .",
    "however , it is important to note that the derived distances do not depend on @xmath57 since , for any fixed dust model , they are determined only by the relative intensity of the rings at different times and energies ( see equation [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the extraction of the ring spectra by selecting annular regions ( in the data sets with 2d images ) is hampered by the spatial proximity of the three rings and by the contamination from the bright central point source and from the diffuse halo .",
    "therefore , we followed a different approach to obtain the background - subtracted spectra of the rings : we derived the number of counts per energy bin by fitting the energy resolved radial profiles of every observation . in order to properly take into account for all the instrumental and systematic effects , we did not use an analytic expression ( as done in the previous section ) , but we resorted to detailed simulations to derive the expected radial profile of each of the following five components : the three rings , the central source and the background .    for each observation listed in table  [ obs ] and for each component separately , we simulated a 2-d image taking into account the effect of the instrumental psf",
    ". a sufficiently large number of photons was generated in order to minimize statistical uncertainties .",
    "the rings expansion was simulated based on the real observation plan and on the expansion law derived above .",
    "the resulting images were convolved with the exposure maps of the corresponding real observations , in order to correct for the vignetting , detector defects and gaps and , in the case of the  data , the regions excluded to eliminate the field point sources ( and out - of - time events for the pn ) .    at this point , we produced the radial profiles of the simulated xrt / pc and epic images , while for the simulations of the 5 xrt observations in wt mode we projected the images onto the x axis of the xrt ccd .",
    "these histograms , with a variable normalization factor , were used to fit the radial profiles and the 1-d wt images observed at the different energies .",
    "the ratio between the number of photons in the simulation and the normalization factor ( with the statistical error obtained by the fitting procedure ) provides the number of photons of the component in the selected energy range . using this method to extract all the spectra ,",
    "no psf correction must be applied to the ancillary response files ( arf ) , because the psf profile is integrated over the whole detector plane .",
    "similarly , no corrections for vignetting and chip defects must be applied , because they were already taken into account during the simulation process .",
    "the wt spectra of the two outermost rings were excluded from the following analysis because their counts could not be unambiguously separated in the wt profiles . to properly model the observed x - ray profiles ,",
    "the addition of a diffuse halo component was also required .",
    "since it has a non - uniform spatial distribution that we are not able to model _ a priori _ , we described it with an analytical function convolved with the exposure map : for the 2-d data we used a king profile centered on , while for the wt data we used a king function convolved with a constant gradient along the x axis because we detected an asymmetry of the diffuse halo .    with the procedure described above we obtained the rings spectra for each observation .",
    "we then fitted these spectra with a phenomenological model ( an absorbed power - law ) in order to obtain the ring s specific intensities as a function of @xmath22 at seven energy values between 2 and 7 kev .",
    "as an example we show in figure  [ figdust ] the results for 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 kev , where the data points of the three rings are indicated by different colors .",
    "the 21 radial profiles ( seven energies times three rings ) were simultaneously fitted with the model of equation [ [ ithetae ] ] for the different dust compositions and grain size distributions described in section 2 , yielding the results reported in table  [ dust ] .",
    "a joint fit is justified by the assumption that the three dust clouds are spatially uniform in the plane of the sky and are made of dust with the same composition and grain size distribution .",

    "however , due to the limited energy band and the relatively large normalization errors , the broad - band spectral shape of the burst is poorly constrained .",

    "therefore , for each model of table  [ dust ] we can derive the distances of the three clouds and compare them with independent estimates of the dust distribution in the direction of .    in order to obtain the distribution of molecular hydrogen along the line of sight we use the co observations obtained by the millimeter - wave telescope at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) @xcite .",

    "this value is consistent with the distance of the farthest cloud ( producing the innermost and brightest ring ) if  is at @xmath14 kpc , as found with the models that gave the lowest @xmath40 in the halo profile fits . in particular , the best fitting model bare - gr - b gives @xmath75 kpc and @xmath76 , 2.6 and 2.2 kpc for the three clouds ( see solid lines in figure  [ co ] ) .",
    "the presence of a large amount of dust at a distance of @xmath13.5 kpc in this direction is also confirmed by the analysis of the infrared extinction of the field stars @xcite .",
    "the relative amount of dust in the three clouds can be inferred by the ratio of their hydrogen column densities , since , for each dust model , we used the same fraction of dust grains per hydrogen atom in the three clouds .",
    "all the dust models give similar column density ratios ( see table  [ dust ] ) , with the farthest cloud containing @xmath124 times more dust than each of the other two clouds .",
    "this scenario is also compatible with the co data and a source distance of @xmath14 kpc , since the two closest clouds could be the responsible for the lower and broader peak of co emission detected at a distance of 23 kpc ( see figure  [ co ] ) .",
    "for larger  distances the largest co emission peak could be associated with one of the closer dust clouds . however , in this case the cloud responsible for the brightest ring would be located at a larger distance , where , based on co emission data , a smaller amount of dust is expected . in conclusion , it seems that also from an analysis of the plausible locations of the three dust clouds , a distance of @xmath14 kpc for  is favored .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that not all the dust along the line of sight be concentrated in the three clouds responsible for the rings .",
    "this is supported by the analysis of the radial profiles discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "in fact , in all observations , we obtained best - fit parameters of the king profile different from those expected for a point source , clearly indicating the presence of a further component of diffuse emission around .",
    "we found that the intensity of this component significantly decreases with time , consistently with its interpretation as scattering of the  burst by dust distributed along the whole line of sight .",
    "another possibility is multiple scattering by the three thin dust layers ; moreover , some contribution to this halo can come from the dust scattering of the x - ray emission of the other bursts occurring during the source activation and of the persistent x - ray emission of .",
    "we finally note that the diffuse x - ray emission recently reported by @xcite and interpreted as emission of a pulsar wind nebula powered by  and of the supernova remnant g327.240.13 is significantly dimmer than the extended emission ( either the expanding rings or diffuse halo ) described here .",
    "three bright x - ray rings were discovered around the anomalous x - ray pulsar  after its strong bursting activity of 2009 january 22 .",
    "their radii were seen to increase and their flux to decrease with time , as expected for a short burst of x - rays scattered by three thin dust layers .",
    "a similar phenomenon had been observed in a few grbs , but on a much smaller scale : in the best case , the rings around grb031203 @xcite were observed by  from 5 to 20 hours after burst , but only @xmath13,000 ring photons could be collected .",
    "the @xmath165,000 ring photons we detected for  allowed us to carry out a detailed analysis in which several subtle effects , that could have been neglected with a smaller statistics , had to be carefully taken into account .",
    "based only on simple , model - independent geometrical considerations , we found that the delayed x - rays seen in the rings were emitted by  within the same time interval of the unscattered radiation detected between 6:10 and 6:56 ut of 2009 january 22 in hard x - rays .",
    "this short time period includes the phase of highest bursting activity ever observed from this source .",
    "interesting information on  and on the dust clouds producing the x - ray rings could be derived from the analysis of the ring s spectra and intensity evolution .",
    "however , this analysis requires the knowledge of the interstellar dust properties affecting the x - ray scattering cross section .",
    "we therefore explored the consequences of using different dust models .",
    "the energy released by the event that formed the x - ray scattering rings could be derived from the fit of the halo profiles , that provides at the same time its spectrum and fluence in the 25 kev band , and the source distance . assuming a column density of 10@xmath67 @xmath3 for the most distant cloud and a bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath77100 kev , a burst energy between 10@xmath69 erg and 2@xmath6810@xmath70 erg was derived ( in the 1100 kev range ) .",
    "these values are significantly larger than that in the pulsating tail detected on 2009 january 22 at 6:48 ut ( @xmath78 erg ; @xcite ) , that therefore can not account for the rings .",
    "more likely candidates are two bright bursts , whose fluence could not be determined because they were so bright to saturate the detectors , and occurred at times compatible with the expansion rate measured for the rings .",
    "however , we can not exclude that the event producing the scattering rings had a very steep spectrum and so dominated the emission at soft x - rays without showing up as an exceptional event at higher energies .    according to our estimate , the energy released by the event that generated the x - ray scattering rings is comparable to that emitted by the giant flares of sgr052666 @xcite and sgr1900 + 14 @xcite .",
    "these events were followed by pulsating tails lasting several minutes , contrary to the case of : the only pulsating tail detected by the continuous  acs observation covering the time interval compatible with the origin of the x - ray rings lasted only 8 seconds @xcite . on the other hand , in case the x - ray scattering rings of  were produced by a single short burst , it must have been exceptionally bright , since no other magnetar bursts without any pulsating tail and an emitted energy @xmath7910@xmath69 erg have ever been detected . the intermediate flare emitted by sgr162741 on 1998",
    "june 18 @xcite was the former record holder , with @xmath80 erg ( assuming a distance of 11 kpc ) .",
    "we caution that large systematic uncertainties affect our estimate of the emitted energy : the total scattering cross - section and source distance depend on the dust model , the hydrogen column density and dust - to - gas ratio in the dust clouds are only poorly constrained , and the broad band spectrum is inferred from a narrow band x - ray spectrum and in analogy to similar events .    by using several dust models discussed in the literature we showed that only about half of them provide an adequate fit to the three halo profiles at different energies .",
    "the best - fitting model ( bare - gr - b in @xcite ) yields for  a distance of 4 kpc , consistent with the value derived from its association with the snr g327.240.13 @xcite .",
    "this model also gives distances for the three dust clouds that are consistent with co observations in this direction .",
    "our best fitting dust model is the same that provided the best fits to the halo of gx51 @xcite , but also other models , that were compatible with the analysis of x - ray halos of other x - ray binaries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , gave good fits to our data .",
    "they resulted in distances for  in the 4.85.4 kpc range .",
    "other dust models giving relatively good fits imply distances of 68 kpc , but require that the highest peak seen in the co emission corresponds to the cloud responsible for the second x - ray ring .",
    "this is not the brightest ring , and thus these scenarios would imply that the strength of the co line is not proportional to the amount of dust that efficiently scatters x - rays .",
    "we finally note that , if the x - ray source and dust distance are not independently constrained , the quality of the fits of the x - ray halo profiles is mostly sensitive to the grain size distribution in the range 0.010.03 @xmath63 m , while the source distance is mainly determined by the largest grains . these grains , with size @xmath790.1 @xmath63 m ,",
    "are those less constrained by diagnostics at longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude that the actual dust properties may be different from all the models we tested , providing a good fit to the x - ray rings , but for a significantly different distance of .",
