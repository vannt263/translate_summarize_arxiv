    "the heavy singlet neutrinos usually have masses @xmath28 to @xmath29 gev , but one may consider a smaller mass for a singlet neutrino . for our scenario the simplest and sufficient model is only one sneutrino acting as the inflaton whose dissipation sources radiation during inflation . the interaction relevant for the model is extracted from the supersymmetric version of the seesaw model as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sneutrino inflaton , @xmath32 is the higgs doublet giving masses to the up quarks and @xmath33 are the top quarks .",

    "note that there are many choices for the remote sector , which are highly model - dependent .",
    "the discussions for the flaton reheat temperature in the remote sector is precisely the same as what has been discussed for thermal inflation .",
    "the typical example that has been discussed in the original work of thermal inflation leads to the reheat temperature @xmath199 of course , there are many choices for the flaton field that lead to many different values of the reheat temperature .",
    "it is not important to show the catalog of the flaton candidates in this appendix , since the purpose of this paper is to show a significant possibility of mssm - remote inflation .",
    "if part of the standard - model gauge group ( or the extended gauge group in some extended models of the standard model ) remains unbroken by the vev of flat fields , the effective mass of the associated gauge fields ( and gauginos ) will remain massless .",
    "the background thermal bath with a temperature @xmath47 will affect the flat direction dynamics .",
    "a detailed study of such thermal corrections has been presented in ref.@xcite with regard to the scenario in which mssm directions are identified with curvatons . for the mssm - remote inflation scenario ,",
    "the situation is precisely the same as what happens in the conventional warm - inflation scenario .",
    "namely , for the mssm - inflaton vev @xmath94 that induces a mass @xmath200 to the field that couples to the mssm - inflaton , the effective potential that arises from the thermal background are @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a gauge fine structure constant . the obvious condition , which arises for any kind of warm inflation scenario , is given by @xmath203 .",
    "of course , this condition must be satisfied during mssm - remote inflation , although it frequently leads to a trivial condition that can be disregarded compared with other conditions@xcite .",
