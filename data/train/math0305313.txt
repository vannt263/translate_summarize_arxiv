    "our interest in this paper is in the following markov chain on @xmath2 , which we call a _ continuous coagulation - fragmentation _ process ( ccf ) : size - bias sample ( with replacement ) two parts from @xmath9 .",

    "we denote by dcf@xmath10  ( _ discrete coagulation - fragmentation _ ) the markov chain describing the evolution of the cycle lengths of permutations of @xmath11 under random transpositions .",
    "the ccf process appears in a variety of contexts , but of particular relevance to us is its occurrence as a natural limit of dcf@xmath10 , when @xmath12 increases , see @xcite for a discussion of this and its link with the space of `` virtual permutations '' .    for any @xmath13 denote @xmath14 ( elements in @xmath15 may be thought of as being of length @xmath12 ; the remaining entries are necessarily zero ) .",

    "the long - time behaviour of the dcf@xmath10 , viewed as an evolution in @xmath15 , is well understood . in particular , see e.g. @xcite , it possesses a unique stationary distribution given by the ewens formula : @xmath20    it is well known , at least since @xcite , that the measures @xmath21 on @xmath2 converge weakly to the poisson - dirichlet distribution @xmath22 with parameter @xmath1 ( a precise definition of @xmath22 is given below in section [ cpreliminaries ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in more than one way ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath22 is invariant for the ccf transition .",
    "this fact , and hints coming from the theory of virtual permutations , led vershik ( see @xcite ) to    [ conj - vershik ] @xmath22 is the unique invariant distribution for the ccf .",
    "our goal in this article is to prove vershik s conjecture",
    ". a naive approach toward the proof would be to use the link with the dcf@xmath10 and the fact that the latter converges to the distribution @xmath23 exponentially fast .",
    "however , the rate of that convergence deteriorates with @xmath12 . to overcome this difficulty , our strategy consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "we provide a - priori estimates ( proposition [ m1 ] ) showing that every invariant distribution for the ccf leads to a good control on the number of `` small parts '' .",
    "we couple the dcf@xmath10  and the ccf in such a way that whenever they start from initial distributions with such control on the tails , the decoupling time is roughly @xmath24 ( theorem [ m2 ] ) 3 .   for initial conditions as above , and for an appropriate class of test functions ,",
    "we show by using some harmonic analysis on the symmetric group that the dcf@xmath10  achieves near equilibrium before the decoupling time ( theorem [ the - xxx ] ) .",
    "these steps are then combined in theorem [ euni ] to yield the proof of vershik s conjecture .",
    "our work began from discussions with bob brooks on various models for  random riemann surfaces \" .",
    "brooks and makover @xcite , @xcite studied riemann surfaces via a dense set of  belyi surfaces \" associated to three - regular graphs on @xmath12 vertices with an orientation at each vertex .",
    "their construction gives a complete riemann surface with finite area @xmath25 for each graph . uniformly choosing a random three - regular graph gives a probability distribution on riemann surfaces , see @xcite for an accessible account of this model .",
    "practical choice of a random three - regular graph is not so easy when @xmath12 is large .",
    "brooks proposed a markov chain method which involved splitting and joining cycles ; investigating properties of his algorithm gave rise to the present paper .",
    "we next review some of the literature on this question .",
    "tsilevich , in @xcite , proves that @xmath22 is the only ccf - invariant measure that is also invariant under additional symmetry conditions .",
    "pitman , in @xcite , proves that @xmath22 is the only ccf - invariant measure which is also invariant under size - biased sampling .",
    "related results appear in @xcite . in another direction , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath22 is the only ccf - invariant measure that is analytic in the sense that for any @xmath26 , the law of an independently size - biased sample ( with replacement ) possesses an analytic density .",
    "finally , tsilevich in @xcite shows that the law of the ccf , initialized at @xmath27 , and stopped at a binomial(@xmath28 ) random time , converges to @xmath22 .",
    "we conclude this introduction by noting that in @xcite , we have introduced a slightly more general model of split - merge transformations , by allowing either the split or the merge operations to be rejected with a certain probability .",
    "an invariant measure for these generalizations is the poisson - dirichlet law of parameter @xmath29 .",

    "indeed , @xmath22 itself has been defined in a variety of manners ( @xcite ) which are well known to be equivalent .",
    "perhaps the simplest is the gem description in which segments are successively and uniformly removed from whatever remains of @xmath0 $ ] , and then rearranged nonincreasingly .",
    "namely , let @xmath46 and for @xmath47 define  @xmath48 ( the removed part at stage @xmath12 ) and @xmath49 ( the remaining segment from which the @xmath50-th part is to be removed ) ,  where the @xmath51 s are independent @xmath52 $ ] variables .",

    ". it will be crucial for the main argument to establish in advance that any such invariant distribution does not put too much weight on very small parts :    m1 let @xmath60 be ccf - invariant .",
