    "the study of the space - time evolution of hadronization during lepto - production on nuclear targets is relatively straightforward because in this case , only one string ( two jets of hadrons ) is produced .",
    "the possible influence of the two string mechanism was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which its contribution was determined to be small .",
    "another important issue is the selection of conditions under which cascading processes in a nucleus do not occur , i.e. , the hadronization occurs beyond the nucleus .",
    "consequently , for the investigation of the hadronization process , it is very important to know the formation lengths of hadrons in lepto - production on the elementary nuclear target ( nucleon ) .",
    "+ such investigations were performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was claimed that for hadrons as composite systems , the notion of formation length is ambiguous as the different constituents of the hadrons originate at different distances .",
    "thus , the question of which of the following two length scales plays the more important role in the hadronization process is an open and model - dependent question : ( i ) the constituent formation length @xmath0 , which is the distance between the dis and the first constituent production points , or ( ii ) the yo - yo formation length @xmath1 , which is the distance between the dis and yo - yo formation points , where yo - yo is the object with the quantum numbers of the final hadron but without its `` sea '' . + in refs .",
    "@xcite , the formation lengths of pions were presented in the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the probability of the formation length being @xmath4 . when @xmath5 and @xmath4 were obtained in the framework of the lund model , comparison with experimental data gave @xmath6 .",
    "this result has confirmed the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite on the importance of the constituent formation length",
    ". we will further consider @xmath5 as a formation length .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is a function of the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the energy of a virtual photon and the fraction of this energy carried away by the final hadron with energy @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , respectively ) .",
    "+ the aim of this work to obtain the average formation lengths of hadrons in cc neutrino- and cc antineutrino - production on a proton target and to compare these values with those for electro - production , which were obtained earlier .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly present a description of the model .",
    "the results and discussion , as well as necessary information for the calculations , are presented in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we begin by considering the distribution of the constituent formation lengths @xmath11 of hadrons carrying away fractional energy @xmath8 : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the full hadronization length and @xmath15 is the string tension . + @xmath16 is the scaling function .",
    "it is defined by the condition that @xmath17 is the probability that the first hierarchy ( rank 1 ) primary hadron carries away the fraction of energy @xmath8 of the initial string in the small interval @xmath18 .",
    "we use the symmetric lund scaling function  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are parameters of the model , @xmath22 is the transverse mass of the emitted hadron and @xmath23 is a normalization factor .",
    "+ information about the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 is presented in the next subsection .",
    "+ the functions @xmath26 are distributions of the constituent formation lengths @xmath11 of the rank @xmath27 hadrons carrying fractional energy @xmath8 .",
    "to calculate the distribution functions , we use the recursion equation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the probabilities of obtaining in some process the compositions of valence quarks for leading ( rank 1 ) and subleading ( rank 2 ) hadrons on the proton target . for hadrons of rank greater than @xmath29 , the condition @xmath30 is fulfilled .",
    "we consider the three types of processes : electro - production , cc neutrino- and cc antineutrino - production .",
    "@xmath25 does not depend on the process type .",
    "the baryons in our scheme are constructed of the valence quark and diquark .",
    "the function @xmath24 is a composition of three factors : ( i ) the probability that as a result of dis , the first constituent ( quark , antiquark ) of the final meson is knocked out ; ( ii ) the probability that as a result of the first break of the string , the second constituent of the final meson arises ; and ( iii ) the probability that these partons transform into the desired meson .",
    "the function @xmath25 is composed of two factors : ( i ) the probability that as a result of two consequent breaks of the string , the first and second constituents of the final meson arise and ( ii ) the probability that these partons transform into the desired meson . for final baryons ,",
    "the antiquark should be replaced by a diquark .",
    "these functions for electro - production were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , and for ( anti)neutrino - production , they can be obtained using refs .  @xcite .",
    "we present here a realistic approach for the calculation of the average formation lengths considering the type of process in which the hadron was produced , the types of hadron and the target .",
    "unfortunately , for the symmetric lund scaling function , the analytic summation of the produced hadrons sequence over all ranks is impossible .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to @xmath31 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "+ in the general case , the function @xmath32 , @xmath33 can be written in the form : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 when combined with direct production , a few resonances may also contribute . here , @xmath37",
    "( @xmath38 ) is the probability that the composite parton system transforms into a hadron ( resonance ) .",
    "we use the condition @xmath39 . + the distribution functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 were described in detail in refs .",
    "all the calculations were performed at fixed values of @xmath42 , @xmath7 and @xmath43 equal to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "+ the scaling function @xmath16 in eq.(2 ) has two parameters  @xcite @xmath47 , @xmath48 and depends on the type of produced hadron . in the calculations ,",
    "the types of observed hadrons and their parent resonances were considered , while for other hadrons , a summation over their types was performed .",
    "the string tension was fixed at a value of @xmath49 .",
    "+ the leading order parton distribution functions from  @xcite were used for the quarks ( antiquarks ) in the proton . + we assume that new @xmath50 pairs are @xmath51 with probability @xmath52 , @xmath53 with probability @xmath54 and @xmath55 with probability @xmath56 .",
    "it follows from isospin symmetry that @xmath57 . for these calculations",
    ", we use the set of values for @xmath58  @xcite : @xmath59 . + for baryon production , we use the set of probabilities for the production of diquark - antidiquark pairs . for simplicity , we express them using the probabilities of light quark - antiquark pairs production .",
    "we use : @xmath60 for the @xmath61-diquark with @xmath62 ( @xmath63-spin , @xmath64-isospin ) ; @xmath65 for light diquarks with @xmath66 ; and @xmath67 for strange diquarks .",

    "the normalized average formation lengths of the pseudoscalar mesons on the proton target , calculated using the symmetric lund model as functions of @xmath8 , are presented in fig . 1 for electro- ( panels a , b ) , cc neutrino- ( panels c , d ) , and cc antineutrino- ( panels e , f ) production .",
    "the formation lengths are represented for pions in panels a , c and e and for kaons in panels b , d and f. the values of the parameters of the symmetric lund model are also presented .",
    "the following parameters are indicated : the formation lengths for the direct pions ( dashed - dotted lines ) ; the sum of the direct pions and the pions from the decay of @xmath68 mesons ( dotted lines ) ; the sum of the direct pions and the pions from the decays of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 mesons ( dashed lines ) ; and the sum of the direct pions and the pions from the decays of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 mesons ( solid lines ) .",
    "the other indicated parameters are as follows : the formation lengths for the direct kaons ( dotted lines ) ; the sum of the direct kaons and the kaons from the decay of @xmath70 mesons ( dashed lines ) ; and the sum of the direct kaons and the kaons from the decays of the @xmath70 and @xmath71 mesons ( solid lines ) . for electro- and cc neutrino - production , the upper and lower curves of each type represent the formation lengths of positively and negatively charged hadrons , respectively . for cc antineutrino - production ,",
    "the upper and lower curves represent the formation lengths of negatively and positively charged hadrons , respectively .",
    "2 , the normalized average formation lengths of baryons and antibaryons in the symmetric lund model as functions of @xmath8 are presented in panels a and b , c and d , and e and f for electro- , cc neutrino- and cc antineutrino - production , respectively . the results for protons and antiprotons are presented in panels a , c and e , and the results for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are presented in panels b , d and f. the contribution of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) resonance and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) resonance is considered for protons ( antiprotons ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , respectively .",
    "+ from figs . 1 and 2 , certain general features of the average formation lengths are apparent : ( i ) for electro- and cc neutrino - production , the positively charged hadrons ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 and proton ) have larger formation lengths than the negatively charged hadrons ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 and antiproton ) ; for cc antineutrino - production , the situation is reversed .",
    "( ii ) all the curves have a characteristic form with values equal to zero on two boundary points along @xmath8 and one maximum in the vicinity of @xmath82 for pions , @xmath83 for kaons , @xmath84 for protons and @xmath85 for @xmath72 .",
    "the magnitudes of the maxima of the distribution do not exceed @xmath86 .",
    "( iii ) the contribution from the decay of resonances is maximal for pions .",
    "this contribution reaches @xmath87 for @xmath78 ( @xmath80 ) meson for the electro- and cc neutrino- ( cc antineutrino- ) production processes .",
    "as expected , the maximal contribution originates from the @xmath68 meson .",
    "the contribution of resonances can be neglected for kaons and baryons .",
    "( iv ) a large difference between the formation lengths of oppositely charged hadrons is observed for kaons and protons .",
    "the maximal difference occurs for cc neutrino - production .",
    "( v ) for electro - production , the difference between the average formation lengths of particles and antiparticles vanishes at @xmath88 ; for cc neutrino- and cc antineutrino - production , the difference is large enough for @xmath8 to equal unity . ( vi ) unlike charged hadrons ,",
    "the formation length of a neutral baryon ( @xmath72 ) is larger than that of the corresponding antibaryon ( @xmath73 ) for all three types of the production processes ; however , the difference between the average formation lengths of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is very small .",
    "+ let us briefly discuss why the average formation lengths of positively ( negatively ) charged hadrons are larger than those of negatively ( positively ) charged ones for electro- and cc neutrino- ( cc antineutrino- ) production . in electro - production , this phenomenon occurs because of the large probability of knocking out a @xmath89 quark as a result of dis . the knocked out quark enters a composition of the leading hadron , which has a maximal formation length .",
    "the @xmath79 meson has an average formation length that is larger than the @xmath78 meson because , in the first case , the influence of resonances is smaller .",
    "the @xmath81 meson has a smaller average formation length than the @xmath80 meson because it is constructed from the `` sea '' quarks of the proton and can not be a leading hadron , whereas the @xmath80 meson can be leading because of the @xmath90 quark entering its composition . in cc neutrino- ( cc antineutrino- )",
    "production , the knocked out parton obtains a positive ( negative ) electric charge , which implies that the leading hadron can be preferably positively ( negatively ) charged .",
    "it should be noted that in the string model , the formation length of the leading ( rank 1 ) hadron @xmath91 , does not depend on the type of process or on the hadron or target type .",
    "in this work , for the first time , the average formation lengths of pseudoscalar mesons , baryons and antibaryons for cc neutrino- and cc antineutrino - production on a proton target in the framework of the symmetric lund model have been determined .",
    "+ the results of the calculations were compared with the previously determined results of electro - production ( see refs .",
    "it was shown that despite certain differences in shape and magnitude , the average formation lengths for electro- and cc neutrino - production have similar behaviors .",
    "cc antineutrino - production differs from the others by the replacement of the particles and antiparticles on antiparticles and particles , respectively .",
    "+ finally , we would like to discuss the possible application of the obtained results .",
    "recently , we have used the simplified version of the average formation lengths calculation for pions obtained in the framework of the symmetric lund model to fit sidis data , in which the possibility of daughter pions production was neglected in eq.(3 ) and the condition @xmath92 was applied .",
    "these simplifications were necessary to reduce the computation time .",
    "the two - parametric fit yielded satisfactory agreement with the data  @xcite .",
