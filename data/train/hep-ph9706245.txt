    "a simple theoretical way to consider inclusive decays of hadrons containing one heavy quark is the _ spectator model _ , which states that only the heavy quark participates in the transition , while the light degrees of freedom are unaffected by the process . as a result",
    ", the model predicts that all the hadrons with the same heavy quark should have the same lifetime .    on the other hand ,",

    "the inclusive width of a hadron containing the heavy quark @xmath8 into a final state with assigned quantum numbers @xmath9 can be written as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the transition operator describing @xmath8 with the same momentum in the initial and final state :    @xmath12 \\hskip 3 pt .",

    "some important features should be noticed in ( [ ris ] ) .",
    "the first term of the expansion reproduces the spectator model result ; @xmath32 terms are absent @xcite since @xmath33 operators can not contribute , being reducible , by equation of motion , to the @xmath23 operator @xmath22 ; finally , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are spectator blind , i.e. they are not sensitive to the light flavour .",

    "their contribution accounts for the presence of the spectator quark , which participates in the decay through the mechanisms known as weak annihilation and pauli interference ( the latter depends on the presence of two identical quarks in the final state ) .    in order to use the result ( [ ris ] )",
    "one has to know the matrix elements of all the previously mentioned operators .",

    ", @xmath48 can be derived experimentally , since it is related to the mass splitting : @xmath49 . on the other hand : @xmath50 , since the light degrees of freedom have zero total angular momentum relative to the heavy quark .",
    "various theoretical determinations exist for @xmath51 . from the mass formula ( [ mass ] ) and using experimental data on the mass of the @xmath52 baryon , one obtains :    @xmath53    and hence it can be assumed : @xmath54 .    in order to evaluate the matrix elements of @xmath27 operators , different approaches must be used for mesons and baryons . for @xmath0 mesons , factorization approximation gives :    @xmath55    @xmath56 being the @xmath57 decay constant .",
    "the same technique can not be applied to baryons , so that one must use other approaches . in the case of @xmath52 ,",
    "heavy quark symmetries reduce the relevant operators to two @xcite :    @xmath58    one can parameterize the matrix elements as follows :    @xmath59    in the valence quark approximation : @xmath60 .    it should be stressed that only large values of the parameter @xmath61 in ( [ otilde ] ) @xmath62 could explain the observed difference between @xmath3 and @xmath63 .",
