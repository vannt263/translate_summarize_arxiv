    "in recent years , there has been a growing interest in studying three - body problem with the aim of approximating the behavior of real celestial systems ( @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . the results from the study have been found useful in the theory of dynamical systems and in astronomy .",
    "the simplest form of the three - body problem is restricted three - body problem ( r3bp ) .",
    "it describe the motion of an infinitesimal mass moving under the gravitational influence of two massive bodies called the primaries which moves in circular orbits around their center of mass on account of their mutual attraction and the infinitesimal mass not influencing the motion of the primaries .",
    "the classical restricted three - body problem possesses five equilibrium points .",
    "the first three points @xmath5 , denotes the collinear points while the last two points ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) denotes the triangular points .",
    "the earth - moon system together with an artificial satellite constitute such problem @xcite .",
    "now , with an interest in four - body problem .",
    "couple r3bp is one of the examples of restricted four - body problem ( r4bp ) .",
    "the smaller body is called as the infinitesimal mas while the remaining massive bodies are called as the primaries . very recently ,",
    "batagiannis and papadakis @xcite studied the families of simple symmetric and non - symmetric periodic orbits in the restricted four body problem .",
    "few among other interesting works are kumari and kushvah @xcite , papadouris and papadakis @xcite , alvarez and vidal @xcite .",
    "the purpose for studying r4bp includes their application in general behavior of the synchronous orbit in presence of moon and the sun .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study the motion of an infinitesimal mass by assuming that the primaries of the system are radiating - oblate spheroids surrounded by a circular cluster of material points . by using numerical computation procedure via wolfram mathematica v10 , we locate the libration points and examine their linear stability under the effect of oblateness and gravitational potential from a circular cluster of material points .",
    "let @xmath8 @xmath9 be the masses of the primaries with @xmath10 moving in circular periodic orbits around their center of mass fixed at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "these masses always lies at the vertices of equilateral triangle with @xmath3 being on the positive x - axis at the origin of time .",
    "the motion of the system is referred to axes rotating with uniform angular velocity @xcite .",
    "the three bodies move in the same plane and their mutual distances remain unchanged with respect to time .",
    "the motion of the primaries consists of circular orbits around their center of gravity .",
    "an equilateral equilibrium configuration of the three - bodies which is a particular solution of the three - body problem given by lagrange is formed by the primaries at any instant of a given time .",
    "we assume that the influence of infinitesimal mass on the motion of primaries moving under their mutual gravitational attraction is negligible . for studying the position of the infinitesimal mass , m , in the plane of motion of the primaries we applied the synodical coordinates .",
    "thus the masses of the primaries are fixed at @xmath11 where the mass parameter @xmath2 is taken as @xmath12 we now take the potential energy of the infinitesimal mass , under the influence of a circular cluster of material points with its center at the origin of the coordinate system , under radiating - oblate primaries as @xmath13.\\ ] ] with @xmath14 define as @xmath15 where g is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radiation factors of the primaries .",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the force caused by radiation pressure force and @xmath21 results due to gravitational force @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath22 is the potential due to the circular cluster of material points ( @xcite and refs therein ) where @xmath23 is the total mass of the circular cluster of material points .",
    "the oblateness coefficients for the more massive primary denoted as @xmath24 @xmath25 and for the less massive primary as @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the zonal harmonic coefficients and @xmath29 denote the mean radii of @xmath30 , supposing that the primaries have their equatorial planes coinciding with the plane of motion . also , @xmath31 is the distance of the infinitesimal mass and which is given by    @xmath32    furthermore , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two parameters which determine the density profile of the circular cluster of material points .",
    "@xmath34 , the flatness parameter , control the flatness of the profile while @xmath35 , the core parameter , controls the size of the core of the density .",
    "now , the lagrangian of our problem can be written as @xmath36 where the perturbed mean motion @xmath37 is define as @xcite @xmath38 @xmath39 is the radial distance of the infinitesimal body .",
    "it then follows that the equations of motion of the infinitesimal mass are :    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 it should be noted here that the suffixes x and y indicate the partial derivatives of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "this system admits the well - known jacobi integral : @xmath46 where c is the jacobi constant .",
    "in this section , we attempt to find the equilibrium points for the cases @xmath47 and @xmath48 . from the equations of motion ( [ e9a ] , [ e9b ] ) , it can be deduce that equilibrium solution exists relative to the rotating frame when the partial derivatives of the pseudopotential function @xmath49 is equal zero .",
