    "from subatomic to cosmological scales , investigating the stability of spatially - bound physical systems is a fundamental test of the efficacy of mathematical models describing natural phenomena . in general",
    ", the system s stability is tested against variations of one or more parameters controlling its overall physical properties .",
    "for example , by tuning the self - interaction energy in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , or by changing a star s central energy - density while keeping the number of baryons constant @xcite . in classical systems ,",
    "perturbation techniques are used to find instability regions in parameter space , with growing ( oscillating ) modes indicating instability ( stability ) @xcite . in quantum systems",
    "the situation is different due to the possibility of spontaneous decay of excited states : atoms which are away from their ground states may decay due to impinging electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations . in this case",
    ", it could be argued that instability is not inherent to the system s internal dynamics , as in the classical case , but induced by its interactions with the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "however , as is well - known , the decay rate expression for spontaneous emission does not make reference to an external electromagnetic field ( as is the case with stimulated emission , or with quantum decoherence for a variety of other `` environmental influences '' @xcite ) , depending only on the properties of the atomic eigenfunctions of the final and initial states . for the simplest case of one - electron atoms these",
    "are known , and the theory of spontaneous decay is one of the great successes of quantum physics .    in the present paper ,",
    "we revisit spontaneous decay from a novel perspective , that of information theory .",
    "we use a recently - proposed extension of shannon s information theory @xcite applied to spatially - bound or periodic physical systems known as configurational entropy ( ce ) @xcite to estimate the lifetimes of excited states of one - electron atoms .",
    "`` information '' here must be considered in the proper context , defined briefly in the next section .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "the `` message '' is a particular configuration described by a spatially - bound or periodic function , in this case the eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom hamiltonian for the quantum numbers @xmath2 .",
    "the `` alphabet '' is given by the momentum modes which compose the configuration with specific weights ( probabilities ) , as obtained from its fourier transform .",
    "this way , each eigenfunction  or message  will have a specific informational signature in momentum space with quantifiable complexity .",
    "shannon s information entropy gives a measure of the complexity of a language in terms of its compressibility ( or redundancy ) : the more redundant and thus compressible a language , the lower its information entropy . messages in languages with high compressibility require less bits of information to encode .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of information entropy as a measure of our ignorance about the system .",
    "thermodynamically , a system in equilibrium maximizes entropy because we have no information about its initial condition ( except for conserved quantities ) : equipartition means no memory .",
    "analogously , the configurational entropy measures the relative spatial complexity of the function describing the physical system in terms of its momentum - mode decomposition .",
    "a sinusoidal wave requiring a single momentum mode minimizes ce . in general , configurations with more spatial localization",
    "require more momentum modes with larger relative amplitudes and thus have higher configuration entropy .",
    "these statements will be made explicit below .",
    "given that the level of spatial confinement of a given function depends on the details of the physics it describes ( interactions , boundary conditions ) , the specific physics that defines the function s spatial properties is implicitly encoded in its ce .    proposed in 2012 ,",
    "configurational entropy has been applied to several physical systems , including solitons in field theory @xcite , relativistic and nonrelativistic stars @xcite , and phase transitions @xcite , among other applications in high energy physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "this paper opens a new front , applying ce to atomic physics , in particular to unstable atomic states . in section [ cesec ]",
    "we review the basic concepts needed to apply configuration entropy to atomic states . in section [ cehatom ] we define and compute the ce for different atomic states of the hydrogen atom . comparing the value of ce with the lifetime for @xmath0-averaged states , we obtain a simple scaling relation that allows us to use the ce as a predictor of the @xmath0-averaged atomic - state lifetimes with an accuracy smaller than 3.7% for states with @xmath3 . since we see no growing deviation from the scaling law with increasing @xmath0 , we can extrapolate its validity to higher values of @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ concluding ] we summarize our results and suggest possible future applications , while in the appendix we present technical details of the calculation and of our numerical approach .",
    "we follow the definition of configuration entropy ( ce ) of gleiser and stamatopoulos @xcite , which we briefly repeat here for convenience . consider a continuous square - integrable function @xmath4 defined on @xmath5 with fourier transform @xmath6",
    "now introduce the modal fraction , @xmath7 the configurational entropy is then defined as @xmath8 = -\\int_{\\mathbf{r^d } } \\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k})\\log \\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k } ) d^d\\mathbf{k},\\ ] ] where we normalized the modal fraction over the mode that carries maximum weight , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 this normalization guarantees the positivity of the configurational entropy .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "[ ce ] is called the configuration entropy density ( ce density ) . for periodic functions",
    ", one would use instead the fourier series for the function @xmath4 and define the discrete modal fraction as @xmath11 , where the @xmath12 are the relative weights for the different modes @xmath0 .",
    "we note that it should be possible , in principle , to choose other functional transforms to obtain alternative definitions for the configurational entropy .",
    "we choose the fourier transform due to its clear physical interpretation , as it relates increased spatial localization with a wider momentum - mode distribution .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a clear connection between ce and shannon s information entropy , widely used in the context of message transmission and decoding @xcite . recall that in shannon s formula ,",
    "entropy is maximized when all symbols ( of an alphabet ) have the same average probability of appearing .",
    "this is also the state of maximal ignorance or uncertainty , with minimal correlation between adjacent symbols .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the case of ce we can _ informally _ interpret each mode of a field configuration as a `` letter '' in an alphabet @xcite .",
    "the field configuration represented by the function @xmath4 ( we will consider only scalar functions here ) is the `` message , '' composed of many field modes .",
    "( in principle , there would be infinitely many modes in the continuum , although in a discrete lattice there is always a level of coarse - graining due to uv cutoffs . )",
    "the modal fraction gives the relative probability for the occurrence of a specific mode @xmath13 , and the ce measures the information encoded in a given configuration taking into account all modes : in general , the more modes contribute to the fourier transform of the function @xmath4 , the higher its ce .",
    "we can thus associate the ce with a measure of the function s spatial complexity : a single fourier mode having the lowest ce and hence lowest spatial complexity , while configurations where modes contribute equally maximize ce and thus spatial complexity .",
    "we now search for a relationship between the configuration entropy of excited states of the hydrogen atom and their lifetimes .",
    "the hydrogen atom is one of the few bound physical systems which were studied analytically since the early development of quantum mechanics . due to the linearity of the schrdinger equation",
    ", the hydrogen wave function can be separated into a radial and an angular part @xcite , @xmath14 with @xmath15 denoting the principal , angular , and magnetic quantum number , respectively .",
    "as is well - known , an excited state may decay to a lower excited state and eventually to the ground state by emitting a photon of wavelength @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy difference between the two states .",
    "in old quantum theory , spontaneous emission is explained phenomenologically using detailed balance of the electron and the radiation field .",
    "einstein @xcite introduced the coefficient @xmath18 , the probability per unit time for the electron to decay from @xmath19 , in terms of @xmath20 , the coefficient of stimulated emission probability per unit time as , @xmath21 spontaneous emission was not thoroughly described until the advent of qed , when the coupling between the electromagnetic field in empty space and the atom was included .",
    "@xcite gives a purely quantum treatment for spontaneous emission , leading to the same result as that obtained using the einstein coefficient @xmath18 , where the initial and final states should obey the selection rules for dipole transitions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the expression of the transition coefficient @xmath18 averaged over angular momentum is , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angular frequency for the transition @xmath26 , @xmath27 is planck s constant , @xmath28 is the electron mass , @xmath29 its charge , and @xmath30 is the dimensionless transition matrix element averaged over angular momentum .    in what follows , we will relate the stability ( lifetime ) of the excited states of the hydrogen atom against decay via spontaneous emission to their respective configurational entropy ( ce ) . to do this",
    ", we compute the ce of the probability density of various hydrogen - atom excited states and compare the results to the corresponding spontaneous emission rates .      in order to apply the concept of ce to the hydrogen atom ,",
    "we first need to compute the fourier transform of the wave function or of the probability density function of various excited states .",
    "the detailed derivation and an example are provided in the appendix .",
    "we repeat the main results here .",
    "the fourier transform of the atomic wave function , written in spherical coordinates as @xmath31 , is : @xmath32 we could also use spherical bessel functions in the integrand to write , @xmath33 .    to compute the fourier transform of the hydrogen atom wave function",
    ", one would use the specific form of the radial function @xmath34 corresponding to an excited state labeled by @xmath35 into eq .",
    "[ coreresult ] .",
    "however , with the interpretation of the probability density as giving spatial information about the electron s position , we find it a more natural quantity to use in the computation of the ce instead of the wave function .",
    "this also avoids issues related with the physical interpretation of the wave function .",
    "since the probability density is defined as @xmath36 , it has azimuthal symmetry and can be expanded as , @xmath37    where in the last step we used that @xmath38 is a polynomial in @xmath39 of order @xmath40 with even terms only and thus can be expanded in terms of legendre polynomials of even order from @xmath41 to @xmath40 .",
    "this property allows us to use eq .",
    "[ coreresult ] to compute the fourier transform of the probability density function with the following steps : first , expand the angular part of the density function as @xmath42 as above .",
    "then , compute the fourier transform @xmath43 of each of the functions @xmath44 using eq .",
    "[ coreresult ] for all @xmath45 .",
    "because the fourier transform is a linear functional , sum over all @xmath43 with the weight @xmath46 computed in the first step and the result is the fourier transform of the probability density function corresponding to a given state @xmath35 .",
    "once we have the fourier transform of the probability density function , we can calculate the ce as defined in section [ cesec ] .",
    "we calculate the ce for all states of the hydrogen atom with principal quantum number @xmath3 using the probability density function . as usual , the states are denoted as @xmath47 all the way to @xmath48 .",

    "@xcite , which also lists it as a function of principal quantum number @xmath0 , @xmath561/lifetime .",
    "this database contains all hydrogen dipole transition probabilities ( in units of @xmath57 ) averaged over angular momentum up to @xmath58 . as an example , to get the _ total _ transition probability of the @xmath59 state , they sum over the possible dipole transitions @xmath60 and divide by @xmath61 , which is the degeneracy of the @xmath59 state .",
    "this justifies our averaging scheme for the ce of the state @xmath0 above .",
    "we take one further step and average the transition probability over the number of possible transition routes in terms of the principal quantum number . for instance , the state @xmath59 can only decay to @xmath62 ( via two - photon emission in the case of @xmath63 , but via dipole for @xmath64 ) , while @xmath65 can decay to @xmath62 or @xmath59 .",
    "we thus define the decay - route averaged transition probability as @xmath66    in table i we list @xmath67 computed from the database of ref .",

    "this is related to the ce of a spatially - bound function being a measure of its localization : the more spatially - localized the function , the higher its ce and the more unstable it is . in the context of atomic physics , this instability is manifested as a shorter lifetime of the state .",
    "we can see this intuitively by computing the ce of a gaussian function in @xmath77 dimensions . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a gaussian function @xmath78 $ ] , the normalized modal fraction is @xmath79 $ ] ( independent of spatial dimensions ) and the ce is @xmath80 = \\frac{d}{2}(2\\pi\\alpha)^{(d/2)}$ ] .",
    "clearly , as @xmath81 , the gaussian approaches a delta function in space , and its ce diverges : in that limit , as we know from the fourier integral of a delta function , all momentum modes would contribute with equal amplitudes .",
    "in analogy with thermodynamic entropy , which is maximized at mode equipartition , the configuration entropy is maximized when all modes contribute equally to the modal fraction @xcite . in information theory",
    ", this corresponds to the state of maximal ignorance , a message requiring the largest number of bits to encode . in the context of configurational entropy as applied to one - electron atoms , `` bits '' correspond to the momentum modes of the fourier transforms of the individual atomic wave functions .",
    "lower values of @xmath0 imply in higher spatial localization and hence higher ce .",
    "this is illustrated explicitly in fig .",
    "[ h - atom localization ] , where we plot , from left to right , the probability density @xmath82 , the ce - density @xmath83 , and the normalized modal fraction @xmath84 for @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the states are less localized , and this is reflected in a smaller range of @xmath13 for @xmath84 and lower amplitudes for @xmath83 .",
    "our central result is the scaling law relating the @xmath0-averaged probability density s configurational entropy of a given state with principal quantum number @xmath0 and its lifetime . for individual states , the lifetimes do nt follow a simple trend , although we observed that it s still possible to extract useful correlations between lifetime and ce for most cases , as long as the lifetimes are sufficiently distinct .",
    "for example , for the transitions @xmath86 and @xmath87 the lifetimes are @xmath88s and @xmath89s , respectively , and their ce s are ( in units of @xmath90 ) ce@xmath91 and ce@xmath92 , or , averaging over @xmath93 states , ce@xmath94 and ce@xmath92 , consistent with a higher ce predicting a more unstable state .",
    "for another example , the transitions @xmath95 and @xmath96 have lifetimes are @xmath97s and @xmath98s , respectively , and their ce s are ce@xmath99 and ce@xmath100 , or , averaging over @xmath93 states , ce@xmath101 and ce@xmath102 , respectively .",
    "of course , only a more detailed study can determine the efficacy and limitations of these correlations between lifetime and ce for individual states .",
    "still , once we average over the state s degeneracy , we have shown that the trend is apparent .    ,",
    "ce density @xmath83 , and normalized modal fraction @xmath84 for @xmath85 . ]",
    "in this paper we examined spontaneous decay of simple one - electron atoms using an information - theoretic approach .",
    "our results rely on an adaptation of shannon s information entropy to spatially - bound mathematical functions , exploring the distribution of momentum modes under the function s fourier transform .",
    "the essential quantity is the configurational entropy of a given quantum state , @xmath49 $ ] , which we obtain by first computing its fourier transform and then extracting its relative distribution of different momentum modes . to obtain the total ce for a given @xmath0",

    "we then compared the ce for that @xmath0 with the total decay rate via dipole emission for that same @xmath0 using well - known tabulated results .",
    "our approach allowed us to obtain a scaling law relating the configurational entropy for a given @xmath0 and the state s total lifetime .",
    "we verified that this law holds with accuracy better than 3.7% within our numerical accuracy for at least @xmath3 , showing no obvious increasing deviation for larger @xmath0 .",
    "we thus uncovered a novel way of estimating the average lifetimes of one - electron atoms which can , in principle , be applied to any value of @xmath0 .",
    "the scaling law presented here only holds for the total state - averaged decay rate and not for individual states , which have varying lifetimes .",
    "a more detailed study is needed for individual cases .",
    "still , they illustrate the use of configurational entropy to study the stability of quantum systems .    for future work",
    ", it would be interesting to compute results for even higher @xmath0s to see if the scaling law holds .",
    "also , a natural extension of the present work is to compute similar relations not only to multi - electron atoms ( using , e.g. , the hartree approximation to obtain a workable wave function to compute the relevant fourier transforms ) but also to other quantum systems , from the simple harmonic oscillator to bose - einstein condensates .",
