    "microwave spectroscopy is a powerful probe of the long - wavelength electromagnetic response of solids , coupling to conduction electrons as well as electric and magnetic excitations .",
    "although we are chiefly concerned with the low energy electrodynamics of superconductors , the apparatus we describe in this article can be used without modification for dielectric spectroscopy and electron spin resonance , at temperatures from 1.1  k to 200  k. this system was developed for microwave spectroscopy in strong magnetic fields , but is sensitive enough to allow high - resolution measurements on sub - mm - sized samples of materials with extremely low microwave absorption , such as superconductors and low - loss dielectrics .",
    "microwave spectroscopy is particularly useful for superconductors , in which the d.c .",
    "resistivity is shorted to zero by supercurrents . at microwave frequencies",
    "the conductivity of a superconductor remains finite but develops a signficant out - of - phase component due to the purely reactive response of the super - electrons .",
    "microwave experiments on superconductors fall into two categories , depending on the strength of the applied static magnetic fields . in the meissner state ,",
    "magnetic fields are excluded from the bulk of the sample . in this regime",
    "the utility of microwave spectroscopy lies in the dual character of the complex conductivity , @xmath4 .",
    "the real part @xmath5 contains details of the scattering dynamics of thermally excited quasiparticles , or ` normal ' electrons .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath6 acts as a thermodynamic probe of the electronic excitation spectrum , its value at low frequencies being proportional to the temperature - dependent superfluid density . in a type - ii superconductor strong magnetic fields",
    "drive a transition to the vortex state , in which the field penetrates the superconductor as quantized lines of magnetic flux .",
    "the microwave response of the vortex state is also of great interest , for both fundamental and practical reasons .",
    "on the fundamental side , microwave spectroscopy provides a clean method of measuring electrical transport properties of the quasi - normal excitations associated with the vortex cores.@xcite this is especially important for the cuprate superconductors , in which upper critical fields are so large that the normal state remains inaccessible in even the highest laboratory fields . on the practical side ,",
    "the same experiments measure the pinning forces experienced by flux lines , and the effect of temperature on depinning them .    for microwave spectroscopy of conducting materials",
    "the experimentally accessible quantity is the surface impedance @xmath7 , the ratio of the transverse components of electric and magnetic field at the surface of the sample . in metals and superconductors where local electrodynamics hold ,",
    "@xmath8 is directly related to the conductivity , @xmath9 . in principle",
    ", the surface impedance can be obtained from an optical - type reflectivity experiment . in practice",
    "this approach has limited success , because in good metals and superconductors the reflectivity at microwave frequencies is indistinguishable from unity .",
    "in microwave work , reflectivity measurements are further complicated by diffraction effects , since the wavelength becomes comparable to the size of a typical sample .",
    "the low - frequency approach , in which leads are directly attached to the sample , is also problematic at microwave frequencies , because the impedance of the sample is typically only a fraction of an ohm .",
    "this would be comparable to the contact resistance and be difficult to match to the characteristic impedance of a microwave transmission line .",
    "a widely adopted solution in the microwave range is cavity perturbation , which circumvents the limitations of both the optical and low - frequency approaches . in cavity perturbation",
    "the sample is treated as part of the inner surface of a high quality factor ( high-@xmath10 ) resonator , often a superconducting cavity .",
    "as we will show below , the surface impedance can be directly inferred from a measurement of the frequency and line - width of one of the resonator modes .",
    "the resonator amplifies the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the sample by the @xmath10 factor , through repeated reflection of the fields .",
    "this multiplies up the signal and provides effective impedance matching to transmission lines . as a result , the resolution of the experiment improves with the @xmath10 of the resonant mode , allowing very low loss samples to be measured .",
    "the resonator also creates fields that are spatially well defined , simplifying geometric effects that arise in the diffraction limit . in the case of electrically anisotropic materials ,",
    "experiments are simplified by judicious choice of the resonant mode , as it is usually possible to align the microwave field polarization with one of the principle axes of a single - crystal sample .",
    "current research in superconductivity often has to deal with materials having complex chemistry , such as the high-@xmath11 cuprates , heavy fermion compounds and organic superconductors . in most cases",
    "the best quality samples are small single - crystal specimens , often less than a millimeter in size .",
    "cavity perturbation measurements on such samples are difficult because they have low microwave absorption , and because the sample surface comprises a very small fraction of the area of the resonator walls .",
    "the challenge of accurately separating temperature - dependent contributions due to the sample from the resonator background was solved by the introduction of a sapphire hot - finger technique,@xcite an innovation that has since been widely adopted . in this technique",
    ", the sample is positioned inside the resonator on an independently heated sapphire plate that is thermally isolated from the resonator .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mmpfull ] . ) sapphire is a good thermal conductor and has low microwave absorption , allowing the sample temperature to be monitored and controlled from outside the resonator , without the thermometry circuits interfering with the operation of the resonator .",
    "the resonator temperature is held fixed during the experiment , so that all changes in the resonator frequency and line - width can be attributed to the temperature dependence of the sample s surface impedance .    for measurements at low temperatures in zero static magnetic field , resonators for cavity perturbation",
    "are usually constructed using superconducting materials , either from bulk material such as niobium metal,@xcite or from copper with a superconducting coating , often a pbsn alloy.@xcite at high microwave frequencies resonators are usually cylindrical cavities operating in the te@xmath12 mode , with the sample positioned on the cylinder axis along an @xmath13-field node , at an @xmath14-field antinode .",
    "below 10  ghz te@xmath12 resonators become quite large , and the accompanying decrease in filling factor makes them unsuitable for measurements on small single crystals .",
    "better filling factors are obtained using more compact resonators , with split - ring and loop ",
    "gap geometries being common choices.@xcite superconducting resonators achieve quality factors ranging from @xmath1 for split rings@xcite to over @xmath15 in the best cylindrical cavities,@xcite which makes them excellent at measuring samples with extremely low microwave absorption .",
    "problems with superconducting resonators include the need for complex chemical treatments when preparing the cavity surfaces,@xcite and the tendency for joints in the resonator to act as weak superconducting links with highly nonlinear microwave response and degradation over time .",
    "the latter effect can lead to a strong dependence of the resonator @xmath10 on microwave field strength , and often limits the operation of the resonator to low microwave powers .",
    "the quality of these resonators also tends to decrease over time due to surface oxidation of the superconducting material .",
    "however , for the most sensitive cavity perturbation measurements , high quality factors are essential and , until now , there has been no alternative to superconducting resonators .    for measurements in an applied magnetic field superconducting materials",
    "are no longer an option as they are either driven normal by the field or enter a highly dissipative state of flux flow .",
    "one solution is to construct resonators from high conductivity , oxygen - free copper but , even at low temperatures , @xmath10 factors are limited to the order of 1@xmath16 to 5@xmath16 , depending on frequency and geometry.@xcite a different approach , giving substantially better results , is to use shielded dielectric resonators . in this case",
    "the dielectric confines almost all the microwave magnetic flux , and screening currents in the surrounding metal are greatly reduced . in previous work gough and",
    "coworkers made hollow sapphire resonators for cavity perturbation that operate in the range 10 to 20  ghz , and reported @xmath10 factors of 2@xmath17 to 3@xmath17 at low temperature.@xcite in the present work we show that better filling factors and higher @xmath10 s can be obtained using high permittivity rutile ( tio@xmath0 ) dielectric .",
    "the microwave properties of rutile are extraordinary.@xcite at low temperatures , in the basal plane , it has a relative dielectric constant of approximately 120 and a loss tangent as low as @xmath18 .",
    "here we report results on two copper - enclosed rutile resonators operating in the frequency range 2.64 to 14.0  ghz .",
    "these have modes with quality factors between 1.1@xmath19 to 6.0@xmath19 and , in the case of the smaller resonator , a filling factor better than that of a 40  ghz cavity resonator .",
    "this results in surface - impedance resolution comparable to that of the best superconducting cavity resonators , with the added capability of operation in high magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , copper - shielded dielectric resonators avoid all problems associated with aging and power dependence in superconducting resonators .",
    "superior frequency stability , with typical drifts less than 1  hz per hour , is also obtained , without the need to regulate the temperature of the 4.2  k helium bath .",
    "this is due to the combination of high mechanical stability of the resonator and the weak temperature dependence of the resonator frequency in this range .",
    "our design for the high field cavity - perturbation apparatus is constrained by several requirements .",
    "we need a mechanically rigid mount for the dielectric resonator , that puts the resonator in good thermal contact with the helium bath .",
    "the resonator must be surrounded by a metallic enclosure , to prevent radiation losses , but the walls of the enclosure have to be kept well away from the resonator to minimize conduction losses .",
    "the enclosure must contain two coupling ports , so that microwaves can be coupled through the resonator in transmission , and allow access for the sample , mounted on a sapphire hot finger . as the hot finger and sample will be heated to temperatures in excess of 200  k",
    ", the space inside the enclosure has to be kept under high vacuum .",
    "working in high magnetic fields places further constraints on the design .",
    "the apparatus described here fits inside a standard 2@xmath20 diameter magnet bore , tightly restricting the space available .",
    "the magnet used in this experiment , an 8  t nbti superconducting solenoid from american magnetics , has vapor - cooled leads , preventing the helium bath from being pumped to 1.2  k. instead , these temperatures are reached in our apparatus with a miniature 1  k pot operating in one - shot mode to cool the sample thermal stage .",
    "in addition , the design includes a feature that is very desirable in cavity perturbation  a movable sample stage that allows the sample to be completely withdrawn from the resonator .",
    "this is done in our system by moving the whole assembly of 1  k pot and sample thermal stage . as a result",

    "the 5.49  ghz rutile resonator is shown inside the copper enclosure , the outside of which is in direct contact with the helium bath at 4.2  k. a movable sample thermal stage is one of the novel features of the design , consisting of an independently heated sapphire hot finger mounted below a movable 1  k refrigerator . a key component of the motion stage is the flexible vacuum seal provided by becu bellows housed inside the 1  k  pot pumping line , separating it from the vacuum space.,width=332 ]    the low temperature end of the apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmpfull ] .",
    "the cylindrical dielectric resonator , with an access hole bored down the cylinder axis , is mounted with ge varnish onto a sapphire plate that suspends it inside the copper enclosure .",
    "the strength and high thermal conductivity of sapphire ensure rigid mounting and good thermal contact between the resonator and helium bath .",
    "a pair of 0.141@xmath20 stainless - steel coaxial lines run the length of the insert and terminate in loops near the cavity .",
    "microwaves are coupled to the resonator through a pair of coupling ports in the sides of the enclosure .",
    "the amount of coupling can be varied by adjusting the vertical position of the coaxial lines , which enter the vacuum space through room - temperature sliding o - ring seals . in our experiment",
    "the maximum coupling is limited by the size of the coupling holes , typically to about 2% of critical coupling .",
    "we usually optimize the position and orientation of the coupling loops to operate at this limit , as this improves signal strength and frequency stability .",
    "it was found in early experiments that the teflon dielectric in the coaxial cables allowed a slow gas leak from room temperature , which , if left unchecked , degraded the operation of the thermal stage .",
    "these leaks were eliminated by coating the ends of the coaxial lines , including the coupling loops , with stycast 2850 black epoxy .",
    "a small charcoal sorption pump attached to the base of the copper enclosure further ensures high cryogenic vacuum for the duration of the experiment .",
    "the temperature of the sample is controlled using a sapphire hot finger connected to a small , isothermal sapphire platform that is weakly thermally connected to the base of the 1  k pot by a thin - walled quartz tube .",
    "sample temperature is measured with a cernox thermometer,@xcite and is regulated between 1.1  k and 200  k by a conductus / neocera ltc-20 temperature controller .",
    "the accuracy of the temperature control is @xmath21  k below 10  k and @xmath22  k at the highest temperatures .",
    "wiring to the thermal platform ( not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mmpfull ] ) passes through the 1  k pot for optimal thermal anchoring , and there is no discernible heat leak from room temperature into the thermal stage .",
    "electrical feedthroughs between the helium and vacuum spaces are made with brass wires , sealed with stycast 2850 epoxy as they pass through the copper base of the 1  k pot .",
    "the entire thermal stage , including the 1k pot , is movable , allowing the sample to be completely withdrawn from the resonator for background calibrations . to permit motion while maintaining a hermetic seal between the 1  k pot pumping tube and the vacuum space , we use flexible becu bellows.@xcite the motion is controlled by a stainless steel rod that runs up the inside of the 1  k pot pumping line and passes through a sliding o - ring seal at room temperature . a ledge in the 1  k pot housing provides positive location for the sample stage when it is in the fully engaged position .",
    "the 1  k pot is constructed in two parts to avoid thermal losses associated with superfluid film creep .",
    "the lower section is made from copper and has a volume of 1.9  ml .",
    "the upper section is a tube made from 0.001@xmath20 stainless - steel shim stock that acts as weak thermal link to 4.2  k. the two sections are connected by a small , circular orifice , 0.5  mm in diameter with knife - like edges , that interrupts superfluid film flow . the 1  k pot is operated in one - shot mode , with a charge of helium provided by connecting the 1  k pot to a supply of high - purity helium gas that liquifies to fill the lower section of the pot .",
    "we find that the 1  k pot has a better base temperature and longer hold time if we assiduously keep the inside surfaces free of contamination .",
    "an important part of this process is to pass the helium gas through a liquid nitrogren cold trap before it enters the apparatus in order to scrub it clean of impurity gases . with these precautions ,",
    "boil - off from the 1  k pot is low enough that it can be pumped with a small turbo - molecular pump down to pressures below @xmath23  mbar .",
    "for operation below 4.2  k , a typical hold - time for the 1  k pot is 10  hours , with a base temperature below 1.1  k. when operating above 4.2  k we keep a small overpressure of helium gas in the 1  k pot pumping line to ensure a reproducible thermal environment in the 1  k pot .",
    "sample interchange is performed with the low temperature insert warmed to room temperature .",
    "the copper resonator enclosure is unbolted from the brass vacuum can at the second lowest indium seal and removed .",

    "working near the sapphire rod , an aluminum mounting jig is brought into position and bolted into place on the indium flange at the bottom of the brass can .",
    "two @xmath24 diameter brass guide pins , which protrude @xmath25 from the base of the brass can , provide alignment for both the mounting jig and the resonator enclosure .",
    "these work by mating with corresponding clearance holes drilled vertically through the jig and enclosure , guaranteeing alignment to better than 0.1  mm .",
    "the sample to be measured is attached to the sapphire hot finger with a small amount of high vacuum grease,@xcite which provides good thermal contact and has negligible microwave absorption .",
    "the sample is mounted so that it sits at the center of the resonator with the 1  k pot stage in the fully engaged position .",
    "this position is a local maximum in the on - axis microwave magnetic field intensity , as described in section  [ sec : resonator ] . siting the sample in this way",

    "the thermal expansivities of oxides and transition metals such as nb are typically over an order of magnitude smaller.@xcite nevertheless , it is always necessary to rule out thermal expansion as a potential source of error in a measurement of the surface reactance .    below 25  k , @xmath68 and @xmath69 diverge : this is a result of the increasing mean free path , which introduces relaxation and nonlocal effects into the surface impedance .",

    "the high resolution data obtained from the new apparatus allow very precise determinations of the flux - flow resistivity and depinning frequency .",
    "the ellipsoid measured here is 300  @xmath27 m in diameter , but we are able to resolve the surface resistance at low temperature with an accuracy of @xmath85 at 5.49  ghz .",
    "this is comparable to the resolution obtained in high frequency superconducting resonators , due to the high filling factor .",
    "finally , we present data from an electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiment on the empty 5.49  ghz resonator , with the static magnetic field applied along the crystal @xmath86 direction . @xmath29 and",

    "one of the great advantages of cavity perturbation is the ability to measure both the real and imaginary parts of a complex response function simultaneously . in this experiment ,",
    "the esr transitions are due to paramagnetic impurities in the rutile .",
    "they clearly illustrate the resolution of the technique and also serve as a caution , showing that paramagnetic impurities must be taken into account when designing the dielectric resonator  significant loss of performance can occur if a zero - field esr transition coincides with the resonant frequency of one of the operating modes .",
    "close inspection of the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : esr ] reveals a frequency - shift uncertainty of 20  hz , corresponding to frequency resolution at the 4 parts per billion level .",
    "this level of noise is actually much higher than the sub - hz frequency - shift errors we typically obtain with the apparatus , due to the fast frequency sweep rate used to acquire the data .",

    "in this appendix we show how cavity perturbation can be used to obtain direct measurements of the surface impedance @xmath8 , the permittivity @xmath26 , and the permeability @xmath27 of small samples placed in the fields of a microwave resonator . , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be treated as scalars , because we usually align the symmetry axes of single crystal samples with the microwave field polarization . ]",
    "the utility of the technique lies in its simplicity  changes in the complex quantities @xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are directly proportional to shifts in the resonant frequency @xmath61 and bandwidth @xmath62 of the microwave resonator .",
    "we use the methods of altshuler@xcite and ormeno  _ et  al._@xcite in the following .",
    "the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the configurations before and after the perturbation , respectively .",
    "although a continuous wave source is used to sweep out the frequency response of the resonant modes , the experiment is effectively probing the free - decay response of the resonator .",
    "it is therefore convenient to use a complex - exponential notation in which , for example , the time dependance of the magnetic field is given by @xmath88 . here * h * is a complex phasor vector field and @xmath89 is a complex angular frequency with positive imaginary part .",
