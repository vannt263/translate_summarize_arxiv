    "spontaneous emission of photons from an ensemble of atoms can lead to superradiance .",
    "first proposed by dicke in 1954 @xcite , it took nearly 20 years for the first experiment @xcite to observe the predicted superradiant emission peak as a function of time , its intensity being proportional to the _ square _ of the number of atoms ( molecules ) of the emitting gas .",
    "originally a quantum optical paradigm , the dicke superradiance effect has become popular again quite recently not only in atomic systems ( trapped ions @xcite ) , but also in other electronic systems such as coupled artificial atoms ( quantum dots ) @xcite , coupled quantum wells @xcite , or localized states in semiconductors @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the superradiance effect in the electron - hole gas of a two - dimensional semiconductor quantum well under a strong , quantizing magnetic field .",
    "belyanin et al .",
    "@xcite already found the possibility of superradiance in _ bulk _ ( 3d ) semiconductors in magnetic fields ( neglecting interactions among the electrons and without pumping ) . in a recent calculation @xcite",
    ", we predicted a novel form of superradiance for an optical active region pumped externally by electron ( hole ) reservoirs . in the limit of only the lowest landau level occupied",
    ", the coherent decay of electron - hole pairs leads to a peak of the emitted light with a strong intensity that , as a function of time , shows oscillations with a frequency @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spontaneous decay rate of a single pair and @xmath0 the rate at which electrons are pumped in the conduction and holes into the valence band .",
    "we start from an eigen basis of wave functions @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum in @xmath7-direction , @xmath8 the magnetic field in @xmath9-direction , @xmath10 the @xmath11-th harmonic oscillator wave function , and @xmath12 a standing wave for the lowest subband of the quantum well .",
    "the index @xmath13 denotes conduction and valence band , respectively .",
    "note that the harmonic oscillator wave functions @xmath10 do not depend on the effective electron mass in band @xmath14 .",
    "we start from the equations of motion for the one - particle quantities @xmath15 factorizing higher order correlation functions , we consider only terms in eq.([p ] ) diagonal in the momentum @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath16 @xmath17 , where we neglect scattering within the same band @xmath14 and consider only @xmath18-wave scattering in hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the derivation of the combined maxwell - semiconductor bloch equations is done in analogy to @xcite .",
    "the electric field is assumed to be polarized in the @xmath19-@xmath7 plane and to be extended homogeneously over the optically active volume @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an estimate for the thickness of the quantum well with area @xmath22 .",
    "the average polarization @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the dipole moment , @xmath26 the magnetic flux and @xmath27 the flux quantum .",
    "for simplicity , we here assume completly filled landau bands , i.e. integer filling factor , and complete spin polarization .",
    "superradiant solutions of the equations that show the dicke effect exist if emitted photons escape at a rate @xmath28 , which is introduced as a damping term .",
    "this allows us to eliminate the electric field , and one obtains a closed set of equations for the polarization @xmath29 and the inversion @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the frequency of the electric field in resonance with the transition frequency @xmath32 between the lowest landau levels @xmath33 in the valence and conduction band .",
    "they read @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\im \\left[\\sum_{n'}\\gamma_{nn'}r_{n'}r^*_n\\right]+t_n\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}r_n & = & -i\\overline{\\omega}_nr_n + \\frac{\\omega_{\\delta}^2}{\\kappa}z_n\\sum_nr_n\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{n'}\\frac{\\gamma_{nn'}}{2i}\\left[r_{n'}z_n - r_nz_{n'}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 furthermore , @xmath38 contains the coulomb interaction @xmath39 and the electron density matrix elements . the term @xmath40 has been derived microscopically @xcite and simulates pumping of electrons and holes into the optical active region if the system is open .",
    "in the following , we concentrate on the case of filling factor @xmath41 ; the case of higher landau levels will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "if only the lowest landau level @xmath33 is involved , eq . ( [ zr ] ) simplify to two coupled equations for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 can be chosen real .",
    "the constant of motion @xmath45 in the case without pumping @xmath46 is the total pseudo spin in the dicke model . for non - vanishing @xmath0 ,",
    "it is no longer conserved and one has instead @xmath47 these equation have been derived and discussed previously in the context of pumped superradiance @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath48 , they describe dicke superradiance , i.e. a strong peak in the emission @xmath49 which is reached for @xmath50 with a maximum @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the maximal emission is proportional to the square of the number of flux quanta per optical active volume .",
    "results for the lowest landau level and typical gaas / algaas parameters are shown in fig.([n0 ] ) .",
    "the system starts from an initially completly inverted state @xmath52 with a finite polarization @xmath53 .",
    "the time evolution of the emitted light is in the form of a peak with a maximum @xmath54 .",
    "this is the so - called dicke peak : the radiation is due to transitions of electrons in the conduction band to empty states in the valence band .",
    "the strong magnetic field quenches the kinetic energy so that all radiators have the same energy difference @xmath31 .",
    "they decay not individually , but in a collective way coupled through the common radiation field .",
    "if electrons are pumped into the conduction band and holes into the valence band , the emission begins to oscillate because after each collective decay the system is ` reloaded ' again .",
    "for the parameters used here , typical time scales are in the sub - picosecond regime .",
    "the microscopic derivation above shows that dicke superradiance is possible at least in the quantum limit of only the lowest landau levels occupied ( strong magnetic fields ) .",
    "we have not included the full magneto - exciton effect into our calculation , but rather considered the case of a magnetoplasma , where excitonic effects are assumed to be less important ."
