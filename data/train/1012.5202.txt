    "they therefore possess extra , `` run - away '' , solutions compared to the einstein , @xmath26 , ones , which can drastically modify the predictions , even in the small @xmath7 limit .    indeed , as shown in @xcite , the theory possesses ghosts when linearised around minkowski spacetime , that is , the hamiltonian contains negative kinetic terms and , as a consequence , the energy spectrum of the metric perturbations is not bounded from below ( just as in the toy model with lagrangian @xmath27 studied earlier by pais and uhlenbeck , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact most `` higher derivative theories '' , that is , yielding equations of motion of differential order higher than two , are thought to possess ghosts ( to the notable exception of @xmath22 theories of gravity , see @xcite ) .",
    "although the presence of these ghost degrees of freedom is harmless at linear level around minkowski spacetime on which all modes propagate independently of each other ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , there are strong arguments to predict that they yield a catastrophic collapse of any system when coupled to other fields , their energy running down to minus infinity in a finite time ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
