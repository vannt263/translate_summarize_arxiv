    "glasses are characterized by a slow approach to equilibrium , a process often described as a journey through a phase space composed of many local energy - minima that are separated by barriers @xcite .",
    "the motion through this phase space is hindered by these barriers ; the system is trapped for relatively long time in one of the local minima before it manages to cross a barrier and move to another metastable state . at finite temperatures ,",
    "crossing a barrier is usually assumed to be controlled by thermal activation .",
    "alternatively , the barriers may be crossed by quantum mechanical tunneling , and this will become the dominant mechanism at sufficiently low temperatures",
    ". it should be possible to tell the quantum - mechanical regime from the thermally activated regime by the dependence of the glassy dynamics on temperature @xmath0 .",
    "dynamics in the classical glass speeds up as the temperature increases , and this feature has been studied extensively in many systems .",
    "the case in the quantum scenario is less clear .",
    "it is commonly believed that , as long as the barrier does not change , tunneling is temperature independent . however , in a dissipative environment , which seems a relevant consideration for the situation at hand @xcite , tunneling rate @xmath1 may depend on temperature ; @xmath1 may increase or decrease with @xmath0 depending on the interplay between the barrier parameters , the coupling of the tunneling object to the environment , and the temperature range @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe several methods to probe the dynamics in electron glasses .",
    "these are used to study the dynamics in the glassy phase of indium - oxide films as function of temperature , non - ohmic electric field @xmath2 , and disorder .",
    "a previous work , based on the the aging behavior , showed that the dynamics in this system does not slow down as @xmath0 is lowered @xcite .",
    "the more sensitive methods used here demonstrate that over some range of temperatures and sample parameters , the dynamics may actually _ slow down _ with temperature .",
    "similar result is observed when instead of increasing the sample temperature the excess energy of the electrons is increased by applying non - ohmic electric fields .",
    "it is demonstrated that increasing the field affects various quantities in the same direction as raising the temperature although quantitatively their effect may be quite different .",
    "the experimental advantages of using non - ohmic fields to mimic higher temperatures conditions are utilized to illustrate some unique features of the electron glass .",
    "several batches of @xmath3 samples were used in this study . all were thin films of crystalline indium - oxide ( 30 - 50  thick , with lateral dimensions of @xmath41x1 mm ) .",
    "these were e - gun evaporated on 110@xmath5 m cover glass .",
    "the sheet resistance r@xmath6 of the samples was limited to the range 1m@xmath7 - 2g@xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "this range includes samples with large enough disorder to exhibit significant glassy effects , and small enough sheet resistances to allow reasonably high frequencies for the ac conductance measurements ( to facilitate a reasonable temporal resolution ) .",
    "gold film was evaporated on the backside of the glass substrate and served as a gate electrode ( configuring the sample as a field - effect device ) .",
    "conductivity of the samples was measured using a two terminal ac technique employing a 1211-ithaco current preamplifier and a par-124a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the measurements as function of non - ohmic fields were performed with the samples immersed in liquid helium at @xmath8 held by a 100 liters storage - dewar .",
    "measurements as function of temperatures were made in a @xmath9he refrigerator with the samples in vacuum attached to a copper stage along with a ge - thermometer .",
    "for these measurements , the ac voltage bias was small enough to ensure ohmic conditions .",
    "temperature was controlled with oxford instruments itc503 employing a ruo thermometer .",
    "fuller details of sample preparation , characterization , and measurements techniques are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work was to characterize the dynamics in the electron glass and its dependence on external parameters in particular the effect of temperature , and electric fields .",
    "the natural ( history free ) relaxation law of the electron glass is logarithmic , a behavior that may extend over more than 5 decades in time @xcite .",
    "following e.g. , a quench - cooling from high temperature to @xmath10 the sample conductance relaxes slowly , and depends on time as @xmath11(where @xmath12 is the conductance at @xmath13 immediately after the cool - down ) .",
    "having no characteristic time scale , such a relaxation law does not allow for a unique definition of a relaxation time @xmath14 .",
    "it is possible however to give an empirical scheme that yields a measure of dynamics . in the following we describe three such methods .",
    "the first example is the two - dip - experiment @xcite , which involves the following procedure .",
    "first , the sample is allowed to equilibrate at the measuring temperature with a voltage @xmath15 held at the gate .",
    "then , a @xmath16 trace is taken by sweeping @xmath17 across a voltage range straddling @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting @xmath16 exhibits a minimum centered at @xmath15 which reflects an inherent feature of a hopping system - its equilibrium conductance is at a local minimum @xcite . at the end of this sweep , a new gate voltage , @xmath18 ,",
    "is applied and maintained at the gate between subsequent @xmath17 sweeps that are taken consecutively at latter times ( measured from the moment @xmath18 was first applied ) .",
    "each such sweep reveals two minima ; one at @xmath15 which fades away with time , and the other at @xmath18 whose magnitude increases with time .",
    "the two - dip - experiment then amounts to studying the dynamics of the `` forming ''  of a cusp at a newly imposed @xmath18 and the `` healing ''  of an ` old ' cusp at @xmath15 .",
    "a characteristic - time @xmath14 is defined as the time at which the amplitude of the cusp at @xmath18 just equals the amplitude of the cusp at @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure is experimentally well - defined , and it is fairly independent of the particular relaxation law . the two - dip - experiment has been used before to study the dependence of the dynamics on carrier concentration , and on magnetic field @xcite .      the main method we use in this work to quantify dynamics is a variation on the two - dip - experiment .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.jpg    starting with the sample with a voltage @xmath15 held at the gate , and equilibrated under the fixed external conditions ( temperature @xmath0 , or electric field @xmath2 ) , one monitors the conductance as function of time @xmath19 to obtain a baseline conductance .",
    "then , the gate voltage is switched to @xmath18 and is maintained there for a certain waiting - time  @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the gate voltage is switched back to @xmath21 and @xmath19 is measured for an additional period of time .",
    "here we are interested in the ratio @xmath22 which is a measure of relaxation time defined for _ a fixed _ @xmath20 . actually , this procedure is just the gate - protocol for aging described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in the aging protocol one varies @xmath20 under fixed external conditions ( i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath2 ) whereas here @xmath20 is fixed and we vary @xmath0 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "a constant value @xmath23 was used for all the experiments reported here .    to see why @xmath22 is related to dynamics",
    "note that @xmath24 is a measure of how far the sample @xmath25 has drifted in phase - space during @xmath26towards its equilibrium state ( set by @xmath18 and the external conditions ) .",
    "if , for example , a full equilibrium is reached during @xmath20 , @xmath24 will obviously equal @xmath27 if , on the other hand , relaxation is infinitely slow , @xmath24 will be zero .",
    "the initial conductance jump @xmath28 is a proper normalization ; when the external conditions are changed , the degree of sample excitation ( when @xmath18 is switched to @xmath15 or _ vice versa _ ) will in general change too , and it will be reflected in @xmath27 likewise , the value of @xmath29 ( c.f . , figure 1 ) should be measured for each run because its value usually depends on the external conditions . the origin of @xmath30 is the equilibrium field effect , namely , the change of the equilibrium conductance when @xmath18 is switched to @xmath31(which in turn is due to the energy dependence of the _ thermodynamic _ density of states ) .",
    "this physical quantity is reflected in an anti - symmetric contribution to the field effect as illustrated in figure 2 for samples with different degrees of disorder .",
    "the values of @xmath28 and @xmath24 are extracted from the @xmath19 data as in figure 1 as follows .",
    "first , the times @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath18 reached its final value , and @xmath15 is reinstated respectively are noted .",
    "these are used as the origin ( @xmath34 for the two relaxations of @xmath35 the first after the @xmath15 to @xmath18 switch , the second after the switch back .",
    "each such @xmath19 start out as @xmath36 ( the first , being history - free , persists as a @xmath37 throughout @xmath38 the second is logarithmic only for @xmath39 ) .",
    "the respective values of @xmath40 are found by extrapolation ( @xmath41 is the resolution time of the measurement , typically @xmath42 . ) , and are used to calculate @xmath28 and @xmath43by subtracting the appropriate baseline .",
    "this method should be easier to implement in systems such as granular al where the anti - symmetric part of @xmath16 is negligible relative to the anomalous cusp in @xmath16 @xcite and thus there is no need for the additional measurement of @xmath29 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.jpg      a quick way to assess dynamics is based on monitoring the relaxation of the excess conductance created , say , by a @xmath17 switch .",
    "then the resulting data @xmath44 is normalized by @xmath45 and the prefactor @xmath46 is used as a measure of the dynamics .",
    "this normalization is not as reliable as the one used in the previous method because it does not preclude the possibility that the excitation itself may depend on the external conditions ( namely , non - linear effects ) .",
    "note also that unless @xmath29 is negligible it has to be measured separately and be used in the analysis .",
    "this method will be used here only as a further illustration of the central finding of our study .",
    "measurements of glassy features as function of temperature are more complex and demanding than it may be at first realized .",
    "this is mainly due to the exponential temperature dependence of the conductance of electron glasses .",
    "note that a pre - requisite for observing non - ergodic effects in these systems is that the sample is in the strongly localized regime . in two dimensions ,",
    "that means that @xmath47 is larger than the quantum resistance @xmath48 in fact , we observe glassy behavior only in samples with @xmath49 ( see , for example , figure 2 and figure 4 ) .",
    "such samples naturally exhibit exponential @xmath25 versus @xmath0 .",
    "this exponential sensitivity of @xmath50 mandates a tight control over the bath temperature since the glassy part of @xmath25 is of the order of only few percents . for the sample used here",
    "it was necessary to establish a @xmath51 temperature stabilization at each instance of the studied range .",
    "another problem that makes these measurements a time consuming endeavour is an inherent memory effect ; changing @xmath0 leaves the system with memory of the previous conditions , and a long equilibration period is required before a measurement at the new @xmath0 may commence @xcite .",
    "this effect will be discussed and illustrated later ( figure 11 ) .    once the bath temperature has stabilized on the target @xmath52 a record of @xmath19",
    "was initiated to detect any drift that still exists due to the glassy relaxation .",
    "the latter could be distinguished from the drift / fluctuation of the bath temperature by the reading of a calibrated ge - thermometer attached to the sample holder .",
    "the measurements that are the basis for the results in figure 3 included , at each temperature , a double - conductance - excitation procedure as well as a @xmath16 scan such as that shown in figure 4 from which the respective value of @xmath29 was obtained .",
    "the @xmath19 data of the conductance - excitation protocol was corrected for the spurious temperature fluctuations by the respective trace of the ge - thermometer .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath28 and @xmath24 were calculated as described above using the temperature - corrected@xmath53 in conjunction with @xmath30 from the data in figure 4 .",
    "the results of the more elaborate two - dip - experiment performed at two temperatures in the studied range are also shown in figure 3 for comparison .",
    "both methods yield the same result ; the dynamics in this particular range of disorder and temperature becomes somewhat _",
    "slower _ with @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence on temperature is rather weak ; for a factor of 3 in the range of @xmath52 the average conductance changes by a factor of 25 while the characteristic relaxation time @xmath14 changes by only 30% . this slowing down of the dynamics with temperature is consistent with a tunneling in a dissipative environment scenario @xcite .",
    "we were not yet able to extend these measurements to higher temperatures .",
    "in addition to the technical difficulties noted above , the glassy effects on which the methods is based die out exponentially with temperature .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the way the anomalous cusp is diminished with @xmath0 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "it should be noted that there is no a - priori reason that the observed trend in @xmath54 will change sign before the glassy effects become immeasurably small .",
    "the transition to a glassy phase in the electron glass is a quantum phase transition @xcite , and for a two - dimensional system there may be no ` glass temperature ' except at @xmath55 .",
    "observation of glassy effects at a finite @xmath0 would still be possible as long as @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the relevant interaction energy ) in the same vein that insulating features are observable in anderson insulators at finite @xmath0 while , strictly speaking , the metal - insulator transition occurs at @xmath55 .      studying the dynamics as function of @xmath2 entails several advantages that make the process easier than the respective study as function of @xmath0 : switching from one value of @xmath2 to another is fast and accurate , the signal / noise naturally improves with @xmath2 ( as long as @xmath2 is much smaller than a critical value see : @xcite ) , and working with a massive @xmath58he dewar as the base temperature makes it feasible to perform long runs without thermally - cycling a given sample . in the experiments detailed below , the equilibration times used prior to running a double - conductance - excitation protocol was typically several hours .",
    "it is important to realize though that even such an extended period of equilibration does not guarantee that the measurement is performed at equilibrium .",
    "in fact , relaxation from an excited state in these systems were observed to persist for at least several days @xcite . as it is impractical to wait that long at each field ( or temperature )",
    ", one has to acknowledge the possibility that the results may deviate from their true value .",
    "we did however test the sensitivity of our procedure to variation in the equilibration time and found that , within the experimental error , waiting more than 4 hours had a negligible effect on the outcome .",
    "the same protocol was used here as in that leading to figure 3 above .",
    "for each sample , and at each value of @xmath59 a @xmath16 scan was taken to get the value of @xmath60 an example is shown in figure 5 for one of the samples .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependence of the dynamics on @xmath2 for a @xmath3 sample at three different states of disorder characterized by the sheet resistance at @xmath61 these were produced from a single batch of indium - oxide by uv - treatment as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "also shown ( lower graph ) is the dependence of the conductance of these samples on the field .",
    "two observations can be made from the figure ; first , for a given field , @xmath22 increases with disorder , which is consistent with a previous study based on the two - dip - experiment @xcite ( note that a larger @xmath22 means slower relaxation ) .",
    "secondly , @xmath22 increases with @xmath59 and there is an obvious correlation between this dependence and the deviation from ohm s law of the respective sample ( lower graph ) . in particular , in the small field limit the results for both @xmath62 and @xmath22 tend to become independent of @xmath2 as one expects for the linear response regime .",
    "the increase of @xmath22 with @xmath2 seems to mimic the slowing - down with @xmath0 trend noted in figure 3 above .",
    "it is therefore tempting to cast the results of the upper graph in figure 6 as function of some effective temperature @xmath63 .",
    "one way to do that is by combining the @xmath62 data with the conductance versus temperature @xmath50 of these samples exhibited in figure 7 .",
    "in essence , this procedure is tantamount to using the average conductance as a thermometer .",
    "reservations with this ` effective temperature ' approach will be mentioned later .",
    "the results of this procedure are given in figure 8 , which for all three samples show a similar behavior of the dynamics as that exhibited in figure 3 as function of temperature .",
    "the observation of a slower dynamics at higher temperatures is not a universal feature of the electron glass .",
    "this dependence has been seen so far only in crystalline indium - oxide films and over a limited range of temperatures . in a preliminary study @xcite employing @xmath64 thick @xmath3 films doped with 3.4% au and",
    "compared their dynamics versus @xmath2 with that of undoped @xmath3 that otherwise had similar characteristics .",
    "two pairs of samples ( au doped and undoped ) were studied so far with @xmath47 @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the following results were obtained : the undoped samples consistently showed virtually the same @xmath2 dependence as in figure 6 .",
    "by contrast , over the same range of fields ( @xmath67 ) , the two au - doped samples exhibited much weaker @xmath2 - dependent dynamics , in fact , within the experimental error , the dynamics was independent of @xmath2 .",
    "a possibly relevant difference between the two types of materials appears to be a wider anomalous cusp which suggests a higher density of carriers in the au - doped samples @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if using a material with still higher carrier concentration will result in the opposite trend of dynamics versus @xmath0 .",
    "this may be attained for example with amorphous indium - oxide films that can be prepared with a much wider range of carrier concentration than can be achieved by doping @xmath3 @xcite .    for the time being we shall focus on the dynamics of the crystalline samples that exhibit dynamics slowdown with either @xmath0 or @xmath2 .",
    "this unusual dependence is interesting enough to justify further efforts to establish its existence even for just its uniqueness ; we are not aware of any other glass that exhibits this kind of behavior .",
    "moreover , it would seem that such a dependence might be reconciled with quantum relaxation making the electron glass a prime candidate for such studies .    in the following we describe two experiments demonstrating qualitatively that the dynamics of a crystalline @xmath3 slows down upon an increase in the non - ohmic @xmath68 in the first experiment",
    ", we used the single - conductance - excitation method , and generated normalized relaxation curves measured under different non - ohmic fields .",
    "these are plotted in figure 9 along with the resistance versus field characteristics of this sample .",
    "the slowing down of the dynamics is clearly reflected in the logarithmic slopes of the relaxation curves becoming smaller as @xmath2 increases .",
    "( note however that the values of @xmath29 were not excluded from the data in this case , and therefore the effect is somewhat smaller than that reflected in the figure ) .",
    "the second experiment , utilizing the same sample , is the analog of the temperature excursion protocol ( referred to sometimes as ` rejuvenation ' in the dielectric - glass and spin - glass communities @xcite ) . in the experiment , shown in figure 10",
    ", the sample is initially relaxing from an excited state ( produced by a quench - cool or gate switch ) , and its conductance versus time is recorded for @xmath69 while under a relatively high @xmath70 .",
    "then , @xmath70 is suddenly switched to a near - ohmic field @xmath71 , and @xmath19 ( naturally now lower than when under @xmath70 ) is measured for @xmath72 before @xmath70 is re - instated , and the relaxation of @xmath25 is extended for @xmath73 @xmath74 . note that the @xmath19 during @xmath75 is a natural extension of the purely logarithmic relaxation of the @xmath32 period , which is the natural relaxation law of the electron glass @xcite . however , to get the @xmath19 in these two regions to match as well as in the figure , the time axis of the @xmath75 region was _ right - shifted _ by @xmath76this is precisely the opposite direction that is necessary to match the respective relaxations in the ` classical ' glasses where the dynamics slows down upon cooling @xcite .",
    "note also that the logarithmic slope of the relaxation during @xmath33 is consistent with a _",
    "faster _ dynamics at the lower ` effective @xmath0 ' .",
    "[ [ is - a - non - ohmic - field - equivalent - to - a - higher - effective - temperature ] ] is a non - ohmic field equivalent to a higher ` effective ' temperature ?",
    "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    as explained above , using high fields has some technical advantages over raising the temperature .",
    "the question however is to what degree the effects produced by a large @xmath2 are the same as those produced by raising @xmath0 . in general ,",
    "the state of the system under large @xmath2 would be different than that achieved by a higher @xmath77 this is true in the diffusive regime @xcite , in the hopping regime , and whether or not the system is glassy .",
    "one may be assured that ` heating ' and ` non - equilibrium ' are indistinguishable only if the relevant distribution functions assume their _ equilibrium _ form and with the _ same _ temperature . in terms of measured quantities however , the difference between heating and a high - field situation may be small when the various scattering lengths ( for momentum , and energy relaxations ) are much smaller than the sample dimensions .",
    "the samples used here ( typically , 1x1 mm ) are much larger than the largest scale in the problem ( which is the percolation radius that at the lowest @xmath0 used here is of order @xmath78 , the hopping length is one order of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "it is plausible that , under these conditions , measured quantities will be affected in the same direction by increasing either @xmath2 or @xmath0 , and this is the only assumption made here .",
    "we do not expect that the mapping used in arriving at @xmath63 in figure 8 should be identical to a measurement using an equilibrium bath - temperature @xmath79that equals @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , as the next experiment shows , warming up the sample to obtain the same @xmath25 as that resulting by a non - ohmic @xmath2 may lead to a _",
    "quantitatively _ different effect .",
    "figure 11 shows the time dependence of the conductance of a sample under two different external conditions ; starting from a near - equilibrium state at @xmath80 the sample was quickly warmed up to @xmath81 which caused its ( ohmic ) conductance to increase by a factor of @xmath82 it was then kept at this @xmath0 while its @xmath19 was recorded for @xmath83 next , the sample was cooled back to @xmath84 allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours , and then it was subjected to a field @xmath2 such that the conductance measured immediately after the switch to the non - ohmic field has increased to the same value ( @xmath85 as the respective @xmath25 immediately after the switch to @xmath86(see figure ) .",
    "then @xmath19 was measured while holding this @xmath2 at a bath @xmath87 the ensuing @xmath19 increases with time in both cases , however the @xmath88 variant increases noticeably faster , and it may have a somewhat different functional dependence than the non - ohmic @xmath2 time - trace .    the logarithmic increase of @xmath25 with time under the non - ohmic field has been studied before as a manifestation of a time - dependent heat - capacity @xcite .",
    "the difference between the effect of field versus that of temperature is not surprising ; the field coupling to the hopping system is both inhomogeneous and anisotropic whereas temperature ( via phonons ) couples effectively to all regions of the sample . aiming to set @xmath25 ( at a given time ) at a predetermined value by raising @xmath0",
    "will generally entail quite different current - carrying network than when the same goal is accomplished by @xmath2 .",
    "this difference in also relevant for the energy - balance that determines the steady - state conductance ( reached for @xmath89 ) , which therefore will in general be different for the two routes .",
    "the next experiment carries a double message ; it is yet another illustration that @xmath2 and @xmath0 produce qualitatively similar effects , and it demonstrates that the concept of ` effective temperature ' has at best a limited value for the glass state .",
    "the first half of this experiment shown in the lower graph of figure 12 is the analog of the experiment described before involving a temperature quench ( see figure 10 in reference 5 ) .",
    "starting with the sample equilibrated for 23 hours under @xmath90 and @xmath91 a field effect scan @xmath16 is taken to show the shape of the near - equilibrium anomalous cusp that characterizes these conditions .",
    "then , @xmath70 is quickly reduced to @xmath92 and a @xmath16 scan is taken consecutively at different times after the switch to @xmath93 note that the sample conductance changes in the @xmath94 switch by @xmath95 and this change occurs _ immediately _",
    "after @xmath70 is set ( @xmath25 continues to change logarithmically after the `` quench '' by only @xmath96 % over the next 25 hours , c.f .",
    ", figure 12 ) .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath16 obtained a short time after the switch to @xmath70 is essentially identical to the equilibrium result under @xmath71 ! in other words , the system retains a memory of the value of the field at which it was allowed to equilibrate .",
    "this observation , and the eventual forming of the more prominent and sharper dip @xcite appear to be a replica of the @xmath97 experiment described elsewhere @xcite . at the same time , note that , immediately after the @xmath98 switch one faces an ambiguous situation ; reading the value of @xmath25 one concludes that the system is already under @xmath70 .",
    "however , judging by the shape of @xmath16 ( which is indistinguishable from its steady - state shape under @xmath71 ) , one may just as well conclude that the system is still under @xmath71 .",
    "these experiments then demonstrate that two ` thermometers ' attached to the same system ( namely , the _ value _ of @xmath99 and the _ shape _ of the function @xmath100 ) may give quite different readings .",
    "this is one of the earmarks of a far - from - equilibrium situation @xcite .",
    "the current version of this ` memory - of - a - previous - state ' employing @xmath2 instead of @xmath0 has the advantage of the speed and accuracy alluded to above .",
    "this also makes it feasible to carry out the complementary procedure - go from the near - equilibrium ` cold ' state to the ` hot ' state that , for technical reasons , was not feasible with the @xmath97 experiment @xcite .",
    "note ( upper graph in figure 12 ) that following the @xmath101 switch , the sharper appearance of the dip that characterizes its shape at the low field is essentially lost , and the shape of @xmath16 is much closer to the near - equilibrium shape eventually attained than in the respective situation of the complementary case .",
    "note however that the conductance immediately after the switch is still somewhat lower than its asymptotic value , which is consistent with the time - evolution of the conductance in figure 11 ( see also reference @xcite ) .",
    "this illustrates again that changing @xmath2 ( or @xmath0 ) in either direction is accompanied by a two - stage conductance change ; an initial fast change @xmath102 followed by a sluggish change @xmath103 that has the same sign as @xmath102 .",
    "naturally , this effect should be taken into account when analyzing experiments such as that in figure 10 .",
    "the asymmetry in the resulting effects of ` cooling ' versus ` heating ' presumably reflects the difference between relaxation and excitation ; relaxation is slow while excitation is fast ( see , for example figure 1 ) .    in summary , we have described a number of experimental procedures designed to probe the dynamics of electron glasses as function of temperature and fields .",
    "these methods , applied to crystalline indium - oxide films consistently exposed a non - trivial dynamics .",
    "namely , the dynamics associated with relaxation processes became more sluggish with temperature or when measured using non - ohmic fields .",
    "it is tentatively conjectured that such a behavior reflects the dynamics expected of a quantum glass where diffusion in phase space is controlled by tunneling in the presence of dissipation @xcite .",
    "experiments on other type of materials are planned to further check on this conjecture . at any rate ,",
    "that dynamics which slows down with temperature is attainable at some range of parameters must be viewed as a constraint on any model for the electron glass .",
    "the experiment in reference 5 employed pumped helium cryostat . warming up from @xmath106 back to @xmath107 took much longer than typical relaxation time of the electron glass while cooling down could be done fairly quickly ."
