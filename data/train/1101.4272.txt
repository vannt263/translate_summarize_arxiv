    "the flavor sector in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions has been puzzling because it involves most of the free parameters of the model itself .",
    "although the values of six quark masses and those of three angles and one cp - violating phase of the @xmath10 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix @xmath11 @xcite are all known to a good degree of accuracy @xcite , it remains very difficult to understand why they have the observed mass spectrum and flavor mixing pattern .",
    "the situation in the lepton sector is even worse : not only the absolute mass scale of three neutrinos but also the smallest angle and cp - violating phases of the @xmath10 maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) lepton mixing matrix @xmath12 @xcite are still unknown . to resolve the flavor problem in the sm one has to gain an insight into the flavor structures and possible flavor symmetries behind them . in spite of many attempts in this direction , a successful ( unique and predictive ) flavor theory has not been achieved .",
    "most of the present - day studies on the flavor structures of quarks and leptons are more or less phenomenological @xcite , and among them the texture - zero approach @xcite has proved to be very useful to establish some simple and testable relations between the mass ratios of quarks or leptons and their corresponding flavor mixing angles .    in the three - family framework the fritzsch texture of quark mass matrices @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( up ) or @xmath15 ( down ) , has attracted a lot of interest since it was proposed in 1978 .",
    "it belongs to the more generic nearest - neighbor - interaction ( nni ) form of quark mass matrices , @xmath16 the nni form can always be obtained from an arbitrary form of @xmath17 and @xmath18 via a proper choice of the flavor basis in the sm @xcite .",
    "so the fritzsch texture is actually a nni texture with the additional assumption of the hermiticity conditions @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in view of the problem that @xmath21 and @xmath22 can not simultaneously give rise to a sufficiently large value of the top - quark mass @xmath23 and a sufficiently small value of the ckm matrix element @xmath24 , one has to abandon either the nni feature of quark mass matrices @xcite or their hermiticity @xcite , either partly or completely . and @xmath18 )",
    "to investigate quark mass matrices and their consequences on flavor mixing and cp violation @xcite .",
    "but we do not focus on this possibility in the present work . ]",
    "it is always possible to numerically determine the departures of realistic @xmath25 and @xmath18 from @xmath26 and @xmath22 by using current experimental data .",
    "if such departures are not very significant , they can be regarded as small perturbations and then be treated in an analytical way so that their effects on the ckm matrix elements will become more transparent .",
    "it also makes sense to consider non - hermitian and nearest - neighbor - interacting perturbations to the fritzsch - type lepton mass matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "although the latter can fit current experimental data @xcite , it is very difficult to obtain @xmath0 or equivalently the maximal or nearly maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing .",
    "one possible way out is to introduce the seesaw mechanism to the neutrino sector @xcite , in which the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath29 takes the fritzsch texture as @xmath30 does but the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath31 is ( approximately ) proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "here we follow a different way at the electroweak scale .",

    "let us point out that the present work is different from a recent one done by branco _",
    "et al _ @xcite in the following three aspects .",
    "( 1 ) they have only considered quark mass matrices of the nni form , whereas we are discussing both lepton and quark mass matrices of the same nni form and giving a stronger emphasis to the lepton sector .",
    "in particular , we are concerned about an interpretation of the observed @xmath0 and a prediction of nonzero @xmath34 for the mnsp matrix based on the nni texture of lepton mass matrices at the electroweak scale .",
    "( 2 ) the analytical approximations made in our perturbative calculation are valid to a better degree of accuracy and thus allow one to see the difference between the contribution of fermion mass ratios and that of perturbation parameters ( which signify a departure of the nni texture from hermiticity ) to the flavor mixing matrix elements in a clearer way .",
    "( 3 ) our numerical analysis is more comprehensive than the one done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it shows that current experimental data require the non - hermitian effects to be at the @xmath3 level in both lepton and quark sectors .",
    "this observation is expected to be useful for model building , especially when leptons and quarks are discussed in a unified flavor picture .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we do a perturbative calculation to reveal the salient features of non - hermitian corrections to the fritzsch textures of lepton and quark mass matrices .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a numerical illustration of the constrained parameter space at a reasonable level of perturbations in the lepton and quark sectors .",

    "we have done such a perturbative calculation both to the first order of @xmath66 and @xmath67 and to the second order of them , in order to examine whether the first - order analytical approximations are good enough .",
    "of course , the fermion mass hierarchies should also be taken into account in our calculation .",

    "is allowed in this scenario , it is also straightforward to simplify eq .",
    "( 7 ) in the neutrino sector .",
    "this treatment might not be excellent if three neutrinos have a relatively weak mass hierarchy , but it should be good enough for us to reveal the salient features of non - symmetric corrections to the fritzsch textures .",

    "to reduce the number of free parameters from four to two , one may simply switch off @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",

    "more precise data to be extracted from the upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments may help us constrain the ranges of @xmath164 and @xmath165 to a better degree of accuracy .",
    "\\(2 ) current neutrino oscillation experiments set no constraint on the cp - violating phase @xmath139 .",
    "but the other cp - violating phase @xmath140 is well restricted to be around @xmath166 , as shown in fig .",
    "the reason is simply that a sufficiently large value of @xmath143 requires @xmath167 . to see this point more clearly , we write out @xmath168 with the help of eq . ( 10 ) , where @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "it becomes transparent that @xmath167 , together with @xmath171 and @xmath172 , may enhance the magnitude of @xmath173 and make @xmath143 closer to its best - fit value ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) similar to the definition of @xmath128 in the quark sector , a small parameter @xmath174 can also be defined to measure the overall non - hermitian departure of @xmath146 and @xmath147 from the fritzsch texture .",
    "we illustrate the dependence of three flavor mixing angles on @xmath175 in fig .",
    "the jarlskog invariant of leptonic cp violation , which can be calculated via @xmath176 , is also shown in fig .",

    "the cp - violating effects at this level should be observable in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "finally , it makes sense to compare between the mnsp and ckm matrices derived from the same nni textures of lepton and quark mass matrices .",
    "given @xmath178 and @xmath179 , it can be concluded that the smallness of three quark mixing angles is primarily attributed to the strong mass hierarchies of up- and down - type quarks , while the largeness of solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing angles is mainly ascribed to the relatively weak hierarchy of three neutrino masses .",
    "of course , the cp - violating phases play an important role in either the lepton sector or the quark sector .",
    "note that @xmath180 is smaller in magnitude than all the other elements of the ckm matrix @xmath11 , and @xmath181 is also the smallest element of the mnsp matrix @xmath12 . in other words",
    ", @xmath34 is the smallest mixing angle in both lepton and quark sectors .",
    "this interesting feature is a natural consequence of the flavor textures of leptons and quarks together with their corresponding mass hierarchies .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath182 is favored by current experimental data should be quite suggestive of a unified flavor model of leptons and quarks .",
    "we have introduced non - hermitian and nearest - neighbor - interacting perturbations to the fritzsch textures of lepton and quark mass matrices such that both of them can fit current experimental data very well . in particular",
    ", we find that it is possible to obtain @xmath0 for the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and predict @xmath183 to @xmath2 for the smallest neutrino mixing angle when the dimensionless perturbation parameters in the lepton sector are at the @xmath3 level .",
    "we have shown that the same level of perturbations is required in the quark sector , where the jarlskog invariant of cp violation is about @xmath184 . in comparison ,",
    "the strength of leptonic cp violation is likely to reach about @xmath185 in neutrino oscillations .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nni texture of quark mass matrices can be derived from the introduction of an abelian flavor symmetry ( e.g. , the minimal realization of this idea requires a @xmath186 flavor symmetry in the context of a two - higgs doublet model ) .",
    "we can follow the same procedure to obtain the nni texture of lepton mass matrices if massive neutrinos are the dirac particles . in the presence of a few heavy majorana neutrinos",
    ", one may first impose the aforementioned flavor symmetry on the yukawa interaction of neutrinos to get the nni texture for the dirac neutrino mass matrix and then achieve the majorana mass matrix for three light neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "there are therefore a number of possibilities of model building , but the numerical results must be very different from what we have presented in this work .",
    "one may explore such possibilities once more accurate experimental data on neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing angles are available in the ( near ) future , and in particular when the simple scenario discussed in this paper is phenomenologically discarded or becomes less favored .",
    "let us reiterate that a parallel study of lepton and quark mass matrices , such as the approximate fritzsch textures under discussion , is useful to reveal the similarities and differences between the lepton and quark sectors .",
    "it should also be helpful for building a unified flavor model of leptons and quarks with the help of proper flavor symmetries .",
