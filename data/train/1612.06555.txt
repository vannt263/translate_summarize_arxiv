    "technical developments in femtosecond laser processing have made it possible to produces nanoscale laser - induced periodic surface structure ( lipss ) , and realize , non - thermal ablation for sub - wavelength resolution @xcite .",
    "electron excitation in dielectrics by an intense laser field is the main process in laser - matter interactions . in particular , for femtosecond lasers , electron excitation by multiphoton ionization and tunnel ionization are the crucial , because such nonlinear processes gnerate a controllable free - carrier density and confine material change to the focal volume .",
    "therefore , predicting the electron excitation rate using theoretical models and/or numerical simulation is important .",
    "we have been developed a first - principles numerical method to explore electron excitation under an intense laser field using time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is currently the most reliable and accurate method with feasible computational cost to simulate electron excitation under intense laser fields .",
    "however , an analytical model may also be a helpful tool to understand some fundamental physical processes in laser processing .",
    "keldysh proposed a theory for the electron excitation rate under an intense linearly polarized laser field@xcite .",
    "his approach is very general and can be used to describe the photoionization of different objects from single atoms to crystals @xcite . because of its that generality , the keldysh model has attracted much attention and become one of the standard tools in the theory of laser photoionization . in particular , for atoms and molecules , the keldysh - faisal - reiss ( kfr ) theory @xcite , which is an the implementation of the original keldysh work , is one of the most important theories in understanding the electron - laser interaction .",
    "recently , temnov _ et al _ reported that the electron excitation rate induced by a circularly polarized laser is twice that induced by a linearly polarized laser at the same laser irradiance @xcite .",
    "circularly polarized lasers are also important as an ultrafast laser waveguides @xcite , and in controlling laser - induced nanostructures @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to construct an analytical formula for the transition probability in dielectrics including multiphoton and tunneling processes under a circularly polarized laser .",
    "we derive the transition probability in a crystalline solid under a circularly polarized laser assuming a parabolic two - band system and using the houston function@xcite as the time - dependent wave function .",
    "jones and reiss @xcite pioneered work on the electron excitation rate under a circular polarized laser employing the @xmath1-matrix theory . although the keldysh formula treats the time - dependent wave function of the valence and conduction bands as the houston function and includes only the reduced mass , the jones formula treats only the conduction band as the houston function ( volkov state ) and includes the effective mass of valence and conduction bands independently .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison between the keldysh and jones formulas is not possible . in the case of atoms ,",
    "perelomov _ et .",
    "@xcite reported the analytical formula for the ionization rate under a circularly polarized laser . because our new formula for circular polarization depends only on the reduced mass ,",
    "it can be compared directly with the keldysh formula .",

    "our result maintains this picture up to @xmath89 w/@xmath90 .",

    "the probability of the six - photon absorption falls to zero , because the effective band gap ( @xmath93 ) is larger than 6@xmath94 at this point , and the seven - photon process becomes dominant .",
    "simultaneously , the change of the order of the multiphoton process induces a small jump in @xmath85 which is also seen in the keldysh formula and its extended model developed by gruzdev@xcite .",
    "this abrupt change of the @xmath54-photon process indicates that the averaged kinetic energy @xmath91 defines the effective band gap which is similar to the blue shift of the band gap in the dynamical franz - keldysh effect @xcite .",
    "however , the critical intensity for higher multi - photonic processes is slightly different from that determined by the keldysh formula which may originated from the definition of the band structure .    in a higher intensity region , over @xmath95 w/@xmath90 , the contributions from some @xmath54-photon processes are comparable . in this intensity region ,",
    "the tunneling model is valid because the keldysh parameter , @xmath96 , is less than one .",

    "figure [ fig : pncir ] shows the contribution of each @xmath54-photon process to @xmath50 as a function of the maximum electric field intensity .",
    "the change of the multiphoton process is not abrupt like in the case with linear polarization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] ) and the contribution of each photon processes is more important at lower intensity . in the circular polarization ,",
    "the drop off of each @xmath54-photon process is more moderate compared with that induced by linearly polarized laser .",
    "this qualitative difference origineates from the parameter dependence of the generalized and normal bessel functions .",
    "the contribution of each photon process is also different , because the kinetic energy of a charged particle under circularly polarized laser changes from @xmath91 to @xmath43 , which effectivly shifts the optical band gap . because @xmath43 is larger than @xmath91 by a factor of @xmath107 , which corresponds to a factor of @xmath108 in the field intensity , @xmath109 exceeds @xmath110 at lower field intensity when polarization is circular rather than linear .",
    "laser wavelengths other than of 800 nm are also used for laser processing .",
    "for example , 400 nm ( 3.1 ev ) , which is the second harmonic of 800-nm , is useful to lower the order of multiphoton processes , and 1550 nm ( 0.8 ev ) is the typical wavelength of fiber lasers .",
    "figure [ fig : wl ] depicts the wavelength dependence of the total transition rates under linear ( solid ) and circular ( dashed ) polarizations .    for all wavelengths , above @xmath111 w/@xmath90 ,",
    "the transition rate induced by circular polarization is comparable to that induced by linear polarization . in contrast , at lower intensity , the ratio between circular and linear polarizations becomes large as the wavelength increases : i.e. , as photon energy decreases .",
    "we extended the keldysh - type formula for the solid state under an intense circularly polarized laser assuming the houston function for the valence and conduction bands . because our formula depends only on the reduced mass ,",
    "it can be directly compared with the keldysh formula .",
    "our simple formula describes electron excitation rate , reproduces the keldysh formula with excellent agreement for @xmath0-quartz , and makes it possible to separate the contribution of each @xmath54-photon process with linear or circular polarization .",
