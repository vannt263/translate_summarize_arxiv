    "many observations in the past decade have challenged the traditional picture of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . instead of a two - level hierarchical system , consisting of clouds uniformly dispersed in the intercloud medium ( the so called ` standard cloud ' model , spitzer 1978 ) , the ism shows an astonishing inhomogeneity , with many levels of hierarchy . in order to consider real density functions in physical processes ,",
    "a better understanding of the inventory and topology of the ism is essential , as well as of the processes responsible for their creation .",
    "having an extremely gas - rich ism , dwarf irregular galaxies are particularly suitable for such studies . here",
    "we discuss the inventory of the ism in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , using the spatial power spectrum , and point to several processes that may be involved in the sculpturing of its ism .",
    "the smc is a nearby , extremely gas - rich , dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "taking a part in an interacting system of galaxies ( with other members being the large magellanic cloud , lmc , and our galaxy ) , the smc s morphology , dynamics and evolution is very complex .",
    "being one of our closest neighbors , the smc is attractive for various astrophysical aspects .",
    "the inventory of the cool ism in the smc was recently studied using the high resolution radio observations of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) @xcite .",
    "also , the dust properties of the smc were investigated in detail , and the relationship between the cool gas and dust , using both hi and infrared ( ir ) observations @xcite .    as a dwarf , irregular galaxy , the smc is different from our own galaxy in many respects : its interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) is more than four times stronger @xcite , its heavy element abundance is almost ten times lower @xcite , its dust grains are on average smaller by @xmath2 30% @xcite and significantly hotter @xcite , and the cool atomic phase of hi is only half as abundant @xcite . in spite of all the above , the smc appears to have similar interstellar turbulence properties , in having similar power law index as the galaxy for the 2-d spatial power spectrum of its hi and dust column density distributions @xcite .",
    "what do the 2-d spatial power spectra of the intensity fluctuations mean ?",
    "relating the fluctuations of intensity in ppv ( position - position - velocity ) data cubes and the underlying 3-d velocity and density statistics is a problem that has been recently addressed in @xcite , where it was shown that changing the thickness of the velocity slice it is possible to recover both spectra of turbulent velocity and density .",
    "the smc provides an ideal testing ground for this theory and we apply theoretical predictions to the data .",
    "elsewhere we plan to apply alternative tools for turbulence studies , e.g. principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , the @xmath3-variance @xcite and the spectral correlation function @xcite ( see review by lazarian 1999 ) to the smc data .    the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe briefly the hi observations of the smc . in section  3",
    "we review previous results of the statistical investigation of hi in the smc , using the spatial power spectrum , and investigate the influence of velocity fluctuations on the intensity statistics .",
    "comparison with earlier work and discussion on the origin of the turbulence in the smc , are given in section  4 .",
    "the small - scale hi structure in the smc was observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , a radio interferometer , in a mosaicing mode @xcite .",
    "observations of the same area were obtained also with the 64-m parkes telescope , in order to map the distribution of large - scale features . both sets of observations",
    "were then combined ( stanimirovic et al . 1999 ) , resulting in the final hi data cube with the angular resolution of 98 arcsec , the velocity resolution of 1.65 , and the 1-@xmath4 brightness - temperature sensitivity of 1.3 k , to the continuous range of spatial scales between 30 pc and 4 kpc .",
    "the velocity range covered with these observations is 90 to 215 . for details about the atca and parkes observations , data processing and data combination ( short - spacings correction ) see staveley - smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and stanimirovic et al .",
    "the 2-d spatial power spectrum , @xmath5 , of the hi emission fluctuations ( @xmath6 ) in the smc was first derived in @xcite .",
    "this was the first such study for an entire galaxy .",
    "the power spectrum is defined as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the hi emission fluctuations : @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the spatial frequency , measured in wavelengths , and @xmath9 being the distance between two points . to derive @xmath5",
    "the channel maps ( approximately 5  wide ) were fourier transformed .",
    "the average value of the square of the modulus of the transform , @xmath10 , was then measured in 18 annuli of equal width in @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the coordinates in the fourier plane , being measured in wavelengths ) assuming radial symmetry .",
    "it was shown that the 2-d power spectra were remarkably well fitted by a power law , @xmath14 , over the continuous range of spatial scales @xmath15 30 pc  4 kpc , and over the velocity range 110  200  ( several noisy channels , without significant line emission , were excluded from the analyses ) .",
    "the power - law index was remarkably constant over the given velocity range , and the average slope was estimated with @xmath16 .",
    "no change of the power law slope was seen on either large or small - scale end of the spectrum .    however , an examination of the power spectrum of the hi column density distribution , obtained after integrating along the whole velocity range , showed a change of the power law slope , with @xmath17 being equal @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the power - law behavior of the spatial power spectrum was seen before in the case of our galaxy , for several ism tracers @xcite , and very recently in the case of the lmc @xcite .",
    "the integrated hi column density distribution of the smc , has a steeper spatial power spectrum ( @xmath19 ) , which is consistent with the spectrum of the dust column density ( @xmath20 ) @xcite . in several cases , a steepening of the slope for higher spatial frequencies",
    "was found @xcite .",
    "a change of power - law slope when examining channel maps and the integrated intensity along the whole velocity range , noticed in @xcite , was not found previously .",
    "the 2-d spatial power spectrum of the intensity ( or emissivity ) fluctuations provides important information about the underlying 3-d statistical properties of the ism .",
    "however , as the spectral - line data cubes have two spatial , and one velocity axis , both 3-d density and velocity fluctuations can contribute to the 2-d statistics .",
    "indeed , due to the velocity fluctuations , two clumps along the same line of sight at different distances may appear in the same velocity channel , hence doubling the measured intensity . in order to relate the 2-d statistics to the underlying 3-d statistics of the ism",
    ", one must disentangle density from velocity influence to the power spectrum .",
    "the velocity statistics is probably the most interesting and significant , partly because it directly represents the dynamics of the media , and partly because other methods of turbulence study , i.e. scintillation technique @xcite , fail to deliver this part of information .",
    "the problem of disentangling velocity and density fluctuations was addressed in @xcite ( see also lazarian 1999 for a review of the subject ) .",
    "they found that the relative influence of velocity and density fluctuations on the intensity fluctuations depends on the spectral index of density fluctuations and on the thickness of channel maps .",
    "the latter is easy to understand qualitatively , as it is clear that line integration should decrease the influence of velocity fluctuations .",
    "the former is less intuitive but @xcite showed that if the 3-d density spectrum is @xmath21 , two distinct regimes are present when : ( a ) @xmath22 , and ( b ) @xmath23 .",
    "analytical results of @xcite study are summarized in table  [ t : lazarian+pogosyan ] .",
    "it is easy to see that in both cases ( a ) and ( b ) the power law index _ gradually steepens _ with the increase of velocity slice thickness . in the thickest velocity slices",
    "the velocity information is averaged out and it is natural that we get the density spectral index @xmath24 .",
    "the velocity is the most important in thin slices , and if the 3-d velocity power spectrum is @xmath25 , then the index @xmath26 can be found from thin slices .",
    "note that the notion of thin and thick slices depends on a turbulence scale under study and the slice can be thick for small scale turbulent fluctuations and thin for large scale ones .",
    "the formal criterion for the slice to be thin is that _ the dispersion of turbulent velocities on the scale studied should be less than the velocity slice thickness_. the slice is _ thick _ otherwise . when velocity information is averaged out ( for a more precise definition see lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ) the slice gets _ very thick _ and the velocity fluctuations get independent of density .",
    "predictions of @xcite were successfully tested using numerical mhd data in @xcite and thus we can confidently apply the theory to observations .    to test the predictions by @xcite in the case of the smc",
    ", we have determined the 2-d power spectrum slope , @xmath27 , while varying the velocity slice thickness from @xmath15 2  to @xmath15 100 .",
    "a significant variation of @xmath27 was found , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : gamma - variation ] , consistent with the predictions  @xmath27 gradually decreases with an increase of velocity slice thickness .",
    "the thickest velocity slice gives @xmath28 , which corresponds to the 3-d density power index ( see table  1 ) .",
    "using thin slices , however , we can find the slope of velocity fluctuations to be @xmath29 , which means that the 3-d velocity spectrum index is @xmath1 , which is very close to the 3-d density spectral index .",
    "the transition point between density and velocity dominated regimes is equal to the velocity dispersion on the scale of the whole smc ( @xmath15 4 kpc ) , which is @xmath15 22  ( stanimirovic et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "as the spatial power spectrum shows the importance of structure on various spatial scales , its power - law behavior suggests the hierarchical structure organization in the ism , without preferred spatial scales .",
    "this phenomenon is usually ascribed to the interstellar turbulence @xcite . however , without velocity information one can always wonder whether we deal with a static structure or a real turbulence . indeed , a distribution of sizes of sand grains on a beach also follows a power - law , but no one would call this `` turbulence '' .",
    "the velocity information changes the picture dramatically .",
    "hence , the extreme importance of the techniques which relate the observed 2-d power spectrum with the underlying 3-d statistics of both density and velocity .",
    "here , we have tested the theoretical predictions for such a technique @xcite , and as a result proved , for the first time , the presence of an active turbulence in the smc .    in view of theoretical results in @xcite it is now appropriate to reanalyze all the earlier data .",
    "these data were obtained without much concern about the thickness of velocity slices .",
    "therefore the observed variations of the power index can be due to transitions from `` thin '' to `` thick '' and to `` very thick '' slices . in the case of green s ( 1993 )",
    "data additional complications are related to a divergent line of sight geometry .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the available data will be given elsewhere .",
    "we note that although the description in terms of power spectra is common in hydrodynamics and the mhd theory , it has certain limitations , as discussed in lazarian ( 1999 ) .",
    "for example , the power spectrum analysis does not include information about the phase distribution , dealing only with the modulus of the fourier transform , nor it contains information about the structure connectivity ( scalo 1987 ) .",
    "other methods hence , should be used as complementary statistical descriptors .",
    "power spectrum as it is can provide us with an important insight of what kind of turbulence we deal with , e.g. distinguish the turbulence originating from shock waves from the hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the attempts to test lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) theory were made recently in elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using the hi observations of the lmc . in agreement with theoretical predictions ,",
    "the steepening of spectrum was observed for high spatial frequencies . the puzzling thing discovered by elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was the flattening of the spectra for velocity - integrated intensity , which was interpreted as an effect of the finite lmc disk thickness .",
    "this is an interesting explanation which entails that the lmc spectrum at the scales larger than 100  pc becomes essentially two dimensional .",
    "our study has not noticed a systematic change of the velocity integrated power spectrum at large spatial scales .",
    "this may reflect the fact that the smc , unlike the lmc , is essentially a 3-d entity .",
    "another approach in relating the 2-d with the 3-d statistics in the case of the smc was presented in goldman ( 2000 ) .",
    "there it is assumed that the density fluctuations are a `` passive scalar '' , being driven by the velocity fluctuations , and hence having the same power spectrum .",
    "if we accept that the intensity fluctuations are due to the density fluctuations , then the corresponding spectral index @xmath30 of intensity fluctuations in a 2-d slice can then be related to the 3-d density spectrum index @xmath24 as @xmath31 which for the smc data produces @xmath32 .",
    "the kolmogorov turbulence corresponds to the power spectrum of @xmath33 . ] .",
    "however , we note that the data used in goldman ( 2000 ) are not in the real space ( @xmath34 ) for which his treatment would be correct , but are in the velocity space ( @xmath35 ) . in this situation",
    "the @xcite treatment is appropriate and it provides a different result , namely , velocity index @xmath36 and density index @xmath37 .",
    "( [ q ] ) also predicts that the difference in the power slope between thin and thick slices is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "this is inconsistent with fig .  1",
    ". we also note that for the kolmogorov spectrum the predictions in @xcite ( see table  1 ) coincide with @xmath24 calculated using eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , but this correspondence is accidental .",
    "an interesting application of the power spectrum of hi opacity fluctuations was made by @xcite , in order to explain the long - standing puzzle of the tiny - scale structure in hi @xcite .",
    "assuming a single power spectrum of the opacity fluctuations , with a slope of 2.75 over the range of @xmath15 0.02 pc to @xmath15 4 pc , @xcite obtained opacities consistent with the observations of small - scale hi structure in @xcite .",
    "this is very encouraging and requires re - interpretation of previous observations of the small - scale structure in a similar way .",
    "a preliminary investigation of the small - scale structure found so far by @xcite suggested though a more complex structure function , with a significant change of slope for scales smaller than 0.01 pc .",
    "what can drive the turbulence in the smc ?",
    "the natural assumption would be that it is due to the stirring of the ism produced by a large number of expanding shells found in the smc .",
    "the shell sizes range from @xmath15 30 pc to @xmath15 2 kpc .",
    "hence , one scenario could be that the largest shells drive the turbulent cascade down to smallest observed scales .",
    "however , processes like shell fragmentation and/or shell propagation from the smaller scales ( bottom - up scheme , see scalo 1987 ) , may play significant role too .",
    "the main problem in pinning down the exact mechanisms is that , so far , we have not observed changes in the power spectrum , at any scale up to the entire size of the smc , which would be indicative of energy injection . an alternative explanation was suggested in @xcite , whereby the large scale turbulence is induced by instabilities in the large - scale flows during the last smc ",
    "lmc encounter .",
    "future comparison with simulations of different types of turbulent cascades are essential to resolve this question .",
    "we have successfully tested predictions of the @xcite study on the change of slope of the intensity fluctuation spectrum with the velocity slice thickness .",
    "the smc spectrum appears due to active turbulent motions rather than just a static hierarchical structure .",
    "we found the index for the 3-d velocity spectrum to be @xmath1 , while for the density spectrum to be @xmath0 .",
