    "a fundamental aspect in studies of galaxy formation and evolution is to understand the connection between agn and starburst activity .",
    "the existence of a physical connection between both processes is suggested by the finding that present day galaxies show a strong relationship between the mass of their central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and the mass and concentration of their stellar spheroids ( magorrian  @xcite ; ferrarese & merritt @xcite ; gebhardt  @xcite ; graham  @xcite ) .",
    "if these relations were due to a coevolution of both components during the early assembly of a galaxy , high - redshift quasars and their associated host galaxies would be ideal objects to study the active formation of both smbhs and bulge stars .",
    "studies of molecular gas ( most commonly rotational transitions of co ) , the prerequisite material that fuels star formation , have become an important tool to probe distant quasar host galaxies , and revealed large molecular gas reservoirs of @xmath710@xmath8  in a number of these sources ( see solomon & vanden bout @xcite for a general review ) .",
    "these galaxies typically show huge far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities in excess of 10@xmath9 , which are thought to be powered by starbursts ( and possibly a central agn ; e.g. , omont et al .",
    "@xcite ; wang et al .",
    "observations of molecular gas trace the regions that can host massive starbursts .",
    "in addition , the velocity structure of molecular line emission has the potential to constrain the dynamical state of galaxies out to the earliest epochs .",
    "rotational molecular line emission typically emerges at fir to radio wavelengths , i.e. , in the limited wavelength regime where the agn in distant quasars does not outshine all other emission .",
    "however , the cosmological distances of high redshift quasars make it difficult to resolve the faint emission from their host galaxies a such long wavelengths .",
    "the physical resolution of such observations is in some cases boosted by gravitational lenses acting as natural telescopes .",
    "the gravitational lensing effect also magnifies the observed flux of the background galaxy , in particular for systems in einstein ring configurations . due to the compactness of the agn , optical quasars in einstein ring lens configurations are rare . due to their greater extent ,",
    "the host galaxies of quasars are much more likely to cross the inner einstein ring caustic of a gravitational lens .    in this paper",
    ", we report on high ( 0.3@xmath0 ) angular resolution very large array ( vla ) observations of co in the host galaxy of the @xmath10=4.12 quasar pssj2322 + 1944 , one of only two known @xmath10@xmath74 galaxies that are both gravitationally lensed and detected in molecular gas emission ( the other being bri09520115 at @xmath10=4.43 ; guilloteau  @xcite ) .",

    "it follows the radio - fir correlation of star - forming galaxies ( carilli et al.@xcite ; beelen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating that its fir continuum emission is dominated by intense star formation . in spite of the fact that this source shows only two unresolved quasar images in the optical ,",
    "previous co observations have shown that the molecular gas reservoir in its host galaxy is lensed into an einstein ring ( carilli  @xcite ; hereafter :  c03 ) .",
    "these observations were also used to derive a first lensing model for this source . based on the dynamical structure revealed by our new , higher resolution observations of pssj2322 + 1944",
    ", we have developed a new lensing model , which enables us to reconstruct the velocity gradient in the spatially resolved gas reservoir .",

    "observations were carried out under very good weather conditions with 26 or 27 antennas .",
    "the phase stability in all runs was excellent ( typically @xmath1720@xmath18 phase rms for the longest baselines ) .",

    "the final rms over a bandwidth of 37.5mhz ( 250 , excluding the noisy edge channel ) is 48@xmath21jy beam@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , seven velocity channel maps ( 6.25mhz , or 42  each ) of the  emission were created .",
    "the rms after hanning smoothing is 77@xmath21jybeam@xmath6 .",
    "convolving the data to a linear spatial resolution of 0.5@xmath0 leads to slightly higher rms values of 49 and 80@xmath21jy beam@xmath6 for maps at 250 and 42  velocity resolution .",
    "in figure [ f1 ] , the velocity - integrated  emission over the central 250  is shown . the emission is clearly resolved over multiple beams , and extended on a scale of @xmath21.5@xmath0 .",

    ", this corresponds to a total molecular gas mass of @xmath29  ( where @xmath30 is the lensing magnification factor , see below ) . within the uncertainties , this is in agreement with the value found by riechers  ( @xcite ) based on the  luminosity .    to increase the peak signal  to ",

    "the two brightest spots in the optical image are unresolved lensed images of the agn ( henceforth ` a ' and ` b , ' also indicated as large crosses in figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the optical emission is likely dominated by the broad - line region of the agn , and thus expected to emerge from a compact circumnuclear pc - scale region .",

    "these positions however are clearly offset from the brightest peaks of the molecular line emission .",
    "the third spot in the optical image is the lensing galaxy ( ` g ' , also indicated as a small cross in figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the lensing galaxy lies on the axis connecting images a and b , but by more than a factor of 2 closer to image b. it however lies in the very center of the molecular einstein ring , as expected . at the position of the lensing galaxy , we measure a 45.0ghz radio continuum flux of 79 @xmath23 47@xmath21jy .",
    "this corresponds to only 1.7@xmath20 , and thus has to be considered tentative at best .    in the adopted cosmology ,",
    "the optical brightness of pssj2322 + 1944 corresponds to an apparent bolometric luminosity of @xmath32  ( isaak et al.@xcite ) .",
    "assuming eddington accretion , this corresponds to an apparent black hole mass of @xmath33 . note that this may be considered a lower limit , as black holes in @xmath34 quasars are found to have typical accretion rates of @xmath35 ( e.g. , shen et al .",

    "seven 42  wide velocity channels of the  emission line are shown ( channel 7 was omitted from the data shown in figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] due to higher noise ) .",
    "emission along the einstein ring is detected in all channels .",
    "clearly , the emission is moving systematically along the ring from the red part of the  line to the blue .",
    "note that there are many peaks of similar surface brightness ( peak fluxes of 450550@xmath21jybeam@xmath6 , or @xmath24=67k ) that are found at different positions at different velocities .",
    "this indicates , to first order , a dynamical structure of uniform surface brightness , where the components at different velocities get projected to different positions in the lens plane .",
    "this puts us in the unique situation to model the gravitational lens configuration in this system in detail , and to recover the intrinsic dynamical structure of the quasar host galaxy in the background .",
    "in a previous attempt to model the gravitational lensing effect toward the molecular gas reservoir of , c03 adopted a generic model based on the strongly lensed @xmath10=0.84 radio galaxy mg1131 + 0456 . by comparing various source configurations in the assumed lens potential and based on plausibility arguments",
    ", a model was found that described the overall properties of the observed ring structure . to enable us to describe the intrinsic properties of  in more detail , we here present a direct model reconstruction and inversion of the lensing effect in this system .",
    "this modeling is based on the new co observations presented in the previous section .      due to the remaining observational uncertainties , it is not possible to derive a _ unique _",
    "solution for the inversion of the gravitational lens .",
    "we thus explored the parameter space permitted by the data ( and our modeling assumptions ) to find the best possible solution ; if some property of the models is consistent throughout this permitted volume , it can be considered well - constrained at high confidence .",
    "this parameter study thus follows a bayesian approach @xcite , using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm does not simply aim at minimizing @xmath36 to find the best model ( which may `` overfit '' the data by fitting part of the noise ) , but explores the whole range of plausible fits . by doing this",
    ", we can use a large number of parameters ( e.g. source pixel values ) in our model without overfitting the noise ( since a broad region in parameter space with higher @xmath36 can outweigh a particular solution that has very low @xmath36 if the volume of the parameter space near the very low @xmath36 solution is very small ) .",
    "the bayesian analysis thus encodes the phase space of possible source distributions allowed by the data into a probability distribution ( e.g. , gregory @xcite ) .",
    "the lensed image of the source was reconstructed based on the integrated co emission line map and the structure detected in the velocity channels , and then used to derive a common model of the lensing galaxy s projected density profile that reproduces the emission in all channels simultaneously . due to the differential structure among the velocity channels ,",
    "this implies that the reconstructed source components after lens inversion will be different for each velocity channel , and will reproduce the velocity gradient across the source .    in this model description ,",
    "the unknowns to be inferred from the data are the seven source profiles @xmath37 , one for each velocity channel , where @xmath38 is shorthand for a large number of ( unknown ) pixel values .",
    "the unknown lens model parameters are denoted collectively by @xmath39 . given observed data @xmath40 , the posterior distribution for the unknown parameters is proportional to the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function : @xmath41 here , @xmath40 consists of seven extended images ( one for each velocity channel ) .",
    "we make the following standard assumption for @xmath42 : assuming that we know the source and lens properties , we would predict the observed image to be the lensed , blurred image of that source , plus additive gaussian noise : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the @xmath46th pixel of the @xmath47th image , and @xmath48 is the model image calculated by lensing and blurring the @xmath47th source with the proposed lens model @xmath39 , and @xmath49 is the noise standard deviation in the @xmath47th image estimated from the outer ` blank sky ' regions of each image , i.e. , distant from any detected structure .    in this study ,",
    "the lens was parameterized as a singular isothermal elliptical potential with five free parameters , which are the strength @xmath31 of the lens , the ellipticity @xmath50 of the potential , the central position @xmath51 of the lensing source , and the angle of orientation @xmath52 of the projected density profile . for this model ,",
    "the lensing potential is @xmath53 where @xmath54 the source plane position @xmath55 corresponding to any lens plane position @xmath56 is then given by the lens equation : @xmath57    the optical position of the lensing galaxy was _ not _ used as an initial model constraint to allow for a conservative treatment of the errors .",
    "however , the optical data is used in a second step to better constrain some of the source s intrinsic properties , as described in more detail below .",
    "interferometer maps are reconstructed from visibility data using a scale that samples one synthesized interferometer beam ( i.e. , resolution element ) with multiple pixels .",
    "this means that the noise is not independent for all pixels , as assumed by equation  [ chisq ] .",
    "correct modelling of correlated noise is computationally very expensive , and makes the evaluation of the likelihood ( equation  [ likelihood ] ) very slow . in interferometric images ,",
    "the scale of the synthesized beam , or point - spread function ( psf ) , usually is the same as the noise correlation scale ( depending on the interferometer baseline weighting function used in the imaging fourier transform ) .",
    "a good psf model thus will allow for a proper , but faster treatment of the noise properties .",
    "the correlation length scale of the noise was measured at a clear distance from the detected molecular structure and used as the length scale for constructing an optimized gaussian psf .",
    "this length scale predicts that 1/62 of the pixels are effectively independent at the scale of the images ( 0.03@xmath0pixel@xmath6 ) .",
    "this corresponds to 106 pixels on the scale of the einstein ring .",
    "to not `` overfit '' the image due to noise , only this fraction of information can be used to computationally determine the lens properties .",
    "this means that mcmc calculations have to be run at an `` annealing temperature '' of 62 , or alternatively , the @xmath20 s can be artificially increased by a factor @xmath58 ( e.g. , gregory @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of this short - cut procedure was confirmed by ensuring that the residuals of the model images have the same statistical properties as the background in the observed maps .      the prior distribution for the lens parameters is chosen to be diffuse , but the final result is independent from this selection .",
    "for the seven unknown sources representing the source distribution in the velocity channels , we use independent `` massive inference '' priors @xcite . to generate a random source , a moderate number of `` atoms '' of a certain brightness are added to a blank source plane .",
    "these atoms are given a uniform probability distribution in position and an exponential probability distribution in flux .",
    "the width of each atom in pixels is chosen at random from one of three values to allow for the expectation that pixel values should be correlated with their neighbours .",
    "this procedure generates a random source in which most pixels are dim , and is a more appropriate prior for astronomical sources than most conventional regularizers @xcite .        from the mcmc run , we find that the lens has a strength @xmath31 = 0.745@xmath0 @xmath23 0.014@xmath0 , an ellipticity @xmath50 = 0.969 @xmath23 0.014 , and a position ( @xmath59 = 0.074@xmath0 @xmath23 0.024@xmath0 ;",
    "@xmath60 = 0.109@xmath0 @xmath23 0.029@xmath0 ) [ coordinates are relative to the center of the model images at @xmath27=@xmath61 , @xmath62=@xmath63 . due to the fact that @xmath64 , the lens potential is close to circular , as is the projected lens density profile .",
    "even though the observed position of the lens ( @xmath65 = 0.105@xmath0 ; @xmath66 = 0.080@xmath0 ) was not taken as an input parameter , the model naturally reproduces its position within the errors .",
    "the posterior probability distribution for @xmath52 is bimodal ; with a probability of 62% ( 38% ) , the angle of orientation of the potential is @xmath52 = 109.2@xmath18 @xmath23 7.1@xmath18 ( 62.7@xmath18 @xmath23 6.5@xmath18 ) .",
    "the lens parameters are constrained well by the molecular data alone , so the marginal posterior distributions are close to gaussian ( except for the bimodal @xmath52 distribution , which is well approximated by a mixture of two gaussians ) .",
    "thus , all of the estimates and uncertainties quoted above are of the form ( mean @xmath23 standard deviation ) .",
    "the lensing model described above was derived based on the distribution of the lensed co emission only to allow for a conservative treatment of the errors , and to avoid a main systematic source of error :  the remaining astrometric uncertainties between the optical and radio reference frames .",
    "the results of our study indicate that the optical position of the lens is reproduced well , and thus , that the astrometric offset appears to be small . due to the fact that gravitational lensing is achromatic ,",
    "we thus can use the model derived based on the distribution of the lensed co emission only to also constrain the intrinsic optical properties of the source .",
    "we also can use the positions of the lensed images of the quasar in the optical to further constrain the allowed parameter space , and to estimate the position of the agn within the deprojected molecular gas reservoir .",
    "based on the sample of lenses that fit the molecular line data , the optical positions of the quasar were ray - traced back into the source plane .",
    "as the optical emission of the source is compact , only those models that map both quasar images onto the same position in the source plane within the errors can be considered valid .",
    "we thus discarded all models that did not fulfill this extra criterion .",
    "we find that this extra constraint only marginally changes previous results for the strength , ellipticity , and position of the lens .",
    "however , it does impact the solution for the angle of orientation of the potential , and supports @xmath67 . as the source reconstructions presented in this section are not strongly sensitive to the extra constraint , only results ( and the more conservative errors implied ) from simulations produced without using the optical data are shown unless stated otherwise .      for the seven source profiles in the different velocity channels ,",
    "a `` best '' estimate was obtained by taking the average of all sources encountered by the mcmc run .",
    "this gives the posterior mean for each source , which is an optimal estimate , as it minimizes the expected squared error .",
    "as no unique solution exists for the lens inversion , the full source sample has a certain diversity .",
    "however , by taking the mean , only reproducible features are retained from the full sample . due to the fact that both the resolution and sensitivity of the observations are finite",
    ", the resulting surface brightness profiles are expected to be smooth on a certain critical scale .",
    "substructure may appear on smaller scales , but will be smoothed out in the final model due to the larger uncertainites involved in reproducing such small structures across the permitted volume in parameter space .    in figure [ f5",
    "] , the model - reconstructed ( posterior mean ) molecular gas distribution in the seven co velocity channels ( _ columns _ ) are shown in the lens plane ( _ middle row _ ) , and after lens inversion ( _ top row _ ) , together with the observations ( not convolved , i.e. , at full spatial resolution ; _ bottom row _ ) .",
    "since the lens model is common to all velocity channels , the changing distribution of molecular gas between the velocity channels is due to intrinsic velocity structure in the background source ( note the difference in scale between the lensed and the unlensed source ) .    in figure [ f7 ] , a color composite map of the modeled distribution of the co in the velocity channels is shown .",
    "orange corresponds to the redshifted part of the emission line , green corresponds to the central part , and blue corresponds to the blueshifted part . in the _ right _ panel , the image in the lens plane is displayed , and in the _ left _ panel , the image in the source plane is shown after lens inversion .",
    "a clear velocity gradient is seen in both images .",
    "the brightest part of the emission shows a systemic velocity structure that would be in agreement with a highly inclined , almost edge - on rotating disk of @xmath22.5kpc radius within the uncertainties of the data and modeling .",
    "this structure encloses a dynamical mass of @xmath5  ( assuming a linewidth of 273  as given above ) , corresponding to only 2.5 times the lensing - corrected molecular gas mass ( for highly inclined dynamical structures )",
    ". however , there is also indication for a second , possibly tidal component ( blue / green ) .",
    "this structure is slightly bent , and also has an extent of almost 5kpc , similar to the brighter component .",
    "each component extends over at least 4 - 5 resolution elements in the source plane , and thus is clearly detected and resolved .",
    "the remaining uncertainties in the source reconstruction can be quantified by examining individual mcmc samples to calculate a probabilistic description of different properties of the source .",
    "a manual comparison of models considered to be `` good '' by our statistical analysis however shows that all share the same principal features , and only show significant differences in substructure on scales that are close to the resolution and detection limit , as expected .",
    "it thus is plausible that the overall structure and velocity gradient along the reconstructed source are real .    to quantify the uncertainties in the structure of the molecular gas reservoir of  in the source plane , the posterior probability @xmath68 that the flux in each pixel is nonzero",
    "is shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "the detection probability is shown over the full velocity range ( i.e. , summed up over all velocity channels ) . due to the fact that observational data contains noise ( i.e. , finite positive or negative flux in every pixel of any velocity channel ) ,",
    "the detection probability is nonzero in every pixel .",
    "thus , a detection probability below a certain threshold has to be considered `` background '' .",
    "the detection probability is consistently significantly higher than the background along the structures predicted by the `` best model '' ( see figures [ f5 ] and [ f7 ] ) .",
    "the overall lensing magnification of the co emission as predicted by the posterior distribution for the lens model is @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ f6 ] shows the differential flux magnification between the velocity channels , estimated by calculating flux(lensed image)/flux(source ) for the mcmc samples of each velocity channel .",
    "although consistent with unity within the modeling uncertainties , there is tentative evidence that the flux is more gravitationally enhanced in the line center than in the outer channels .",
    "if real , this would suggest that the profile of the emission line is distorted by the lensing effect .",
    "the model - predicted lensing magnification of the 314 nm continuum emission from the agn as derived from models based on both optical and co data is @xmath70 . excluding the optical constraints",
    "would result in slightly larger errors : @xmath71 .",
    "the overlay in figure [ f2 ] suggests that the optical agn is offset from the peak position of the molecular line emission . in the red co line wing ,",
    "the northern peak of the einstein ring is brighter ( as is the case for the two optical images ) , while in the blue linewing , the southern peak is brighter .",
    "this , together with the optical quasar image positions relative to the lens position , suggests that the agn is located close to the orange peak of the reconstructed molecular gas distribution shown in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "this finding is supported by the model - based inversion of the optical and co data , although the determination of the exact location within that part of the molecular structure is limited by the remaining model uncertainties and the limited accuracy of the relative astrometry of the optical and radio data .",
    "if the agn is indeed located in the upper part of the disklike structure rather than in the center , one may speculate that the spatial and velocity structure of the reconstructed source is more likely to be due to interaction than due to a rotating disk .",
    "we have imaged and modeled a molecular einstein ring of a galaxy at @xmath10=4.12 .",
    "our high resolution  maps of the lensed quasar host galaxy of pssj2322 + 1944 ( a double image optical quasar ) reveal spatially resolved structure that shows a clear velocity gradient in the co emission line . by performing a model - based lens inversion of the einstein ring that is consistent with the data , we are able to reconstruct the velocity structure of this distant quasar host galaxy .",
    "the gravitational lensing effect acts as a natural telescope , and allows us to zoom in on the molecular gas reservoir down to linear scales of only @xmath31kpc , sufficient to reveal velocity structure over almost 10 resolution elements in the source plane .",
    "our novel modeling of this system reveals how the molecular gas crosses the central caustic ( causing the appearance of the einstein ring ) moving from the redshifted to the blueshifted molecular emission .",
    "we also find evidence that the optical quasar may be associated with the redshifted part of the molecular reservoir .",
    "the full reservoir has a mass of @xmath72  ( corrected for lensing magnification ) .",
    "the molecular gas mass alone could account for almost half of the dynamical mass in this system if the galaxy were to be seen close to edge - on ( @xmath73sin@xmath74/@xmath75 @xmath76 2.5 ) .",
    "due to the large spatial extent of the co emission , and due to the fact that the agn is probably largely offset from the center of the reservoir , we conclude that the molecular gas and dust are likely dominantly heated by star formation .    from the fir luminosity of the source in the adopted cosmology ( @xmath77 ; cox @xcite ) , we derive a star formation rate10@xmath78(yr@xmath6/ ) ( kennicutt @xcite ) .",
    "the dust temperature and spectral index of  indicate that the fir continuum emission is dominated by star formation , in agreement with the finding that the source follows the radio - fir correlation for star - forming galaxies ( beelen et al.@xcite ) . ] ( sfr ) of 680yr@xmath6 .",
    "at least part of the co emission of the reconstructed source does not appear to follow a systemic trend in velocity . in this picture",
    ", this structure may be due to interaction , possibly caused by a major merger .",
    "such an event could both feed the agn and fuel the starburst , and thus be responsible for the coeval assembly of a supermassive black hole and the stellar bulge in this system .",
    "future observations of the fir continuum at comparable spatial resolution may shed more light on this situation .",
    "motivated by these results , the dynamical mass derived from the molecular line observations in the host galaxy of the @xmath10=4.12 quasar  can be used in an attempt to constrain the relationship between the central smbh mass and the stellar bulge mass ( @xmath79@xmath80 ) in high-@xmath10 agn galaxies .",
    "such a relation has been proposed for different types of galaxies in the local universe , and appears to hold over more than three orders of magnitude in smbh mass , essentially independent of galaxy type ( predicting @xmath81 , e.g. , kormendy & gebhardt @xcite ) . assuming the optical lensing factor of @xmath82 derived from our model of  and the eddington limit derived in section 3 gives @xmath83 . with the further assumption that the dynamical molecular structure is seen close to edge - on , and that it traces a major fraction of the gravitational potential that hosts the stellar bulge",
    ", we thus find that @xmath84 ( subtracting out the black hole and gas masses would even give @xmath85 ) .",
    "this value is by more than an order of magnitude offset from the local @xmath79@xmath80 relation , but in good agreement with results obtained for other high-@xmath10 quasars , which show similar or larger offsets ( e.g. , walter et al .",
    "@xcite ; wei  et al.@xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "@xcite ; see also shields et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the case of",
    ", one may attempt to account for this offset by assuming that the dynamical structure is seen close to face - on ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) .",
    "this would however predict a large intrinsic co linewidth ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "such a linewidth would significantly exceed the velocity dispersions observed in the spheroids of massive present day elliptical galaxies ( which  will likely eveolve into ) , but is of the same order of magnitude as those observed toward some high-@xmath10 submillimeter galaxies ( e.g. , carilli & wang @xcite ) . such large molecular linewidths are consistent with those predicted by simulations of the hierarchical buildup of massive quasar host galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. , narayanan et al.@xcite ) , and thus compatible with the possible merger nature of .",
    "however , in interacting or merging systems , molecular lines are likely more broad due to the fact that the dynamical molecular structure is not fully virialized yet .",
    "the molecular line widths in these galaxies thus may be by a factor of a few higher than the actual virial velocity of the host halo , which would lead to an overprediction of the bulge mass .",
    "it thus appears difficult to explain the offset from the local @xmath88@xmath80 relation by simply assuming a small inclination angle toward the line of sight . also , assuming that the agn accretes at sub - eddington rates , and/or taking into account that more than a third of the dynamical mass derived above is likely not stellar , but accounted for by gas , dust ( @xmath171% of the gas mass ) , and the black hole further increases this offset .",
    "together with previous such examples , our results for  thus appear to indicate that the black holes in massive galaxies at high redshift assemble earlier than a large fraction of their stellar bulges .",
    "the observations and modeling presented herein demonstrate the power of spatially and dynamically resolved molecular gas studies in strongly lensed , distant agn - starburst systems to provide direct evidence for the scenarios of quasar activity and galaxy assembly in the early universe as suggested by recent cosmological simulations ( e.g. , springel  @xcite ) .",
    "the boost in line intensity and spatial resolution provided by einstein ring lens configurations are currently the only means by which to probe the dynamical structure of the most distant star - forming galaxies at ( sub-)kiloparsec resolution .",
    "such observations provide an important foundation for future observations of molecular gas and dust in the early universe with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , which will be able to probe more typical galaxy populations at high redshift to comparable and higher physical resolution , even without the aid of gravitational lensing .",
