    "the origin of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs ( ucds ; late m- , l- and t - type stars and brown dwarfs with t@xmath13 3000k ) remains one of the great mysteries in our understanding of these cool , low - mass objects .",
    "the first radio detection of the m9 brown dwarf lp  944 - 20 @xcite was unexpected given the precipitous decline in the strength and incidence of optical and x - ray emission among late - m and l dwarfs ( @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 to @xmath18 ; ) and the correlation between x - ray and radio flux among many stellar sources ( i.e. , the guedel - benz relation , @xmath19  hz@xmath6 ; ) . in the chromospheric evaporation model of solar and stellar flares @xcite , the radio / x - ray correlation is attributed to the heating and evaporation of chromospheric plasmas ( x - ray emission ) by accelerated electrons ( radio emission ) via the neupert effect @xcite .",
    "the dozen ucds detected in the radio to date violate the guedel - benz relation by orders of magnitude , suggesting a breakdown in this mechanism .",
    "ucd radio emission also exhibits a broad range of behaviors , including low - polarization quiescent emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , sporadic variability ( e.g. , ) , periodic variability synched with rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , highly polarized bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and `` pulsar - like '' rotationally - synched coherent emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the complexity of these behaviors , and the decoupling of radio , x - ray and h@xmath12 emission trends , has stimulated new theoretical work on the origin of magnetic emission in very cool stars , brown dwarfs and exoplanets ( e.g. , ) . while the decline in optical emission in ucds is a general trend ,",
    "a small number of unusually `` hyperactive '' cool dwarfs have been identified , whose strong and persistent h@xmath12 emission also remains a mystery @xcite .",
    "one such source is the l5e 2mass  j13153094@xmath02649513 ( hereafter 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 ; @xcite ) , a high proper motion , very cool dwarf that has exhibited pronounced and sustained h@xmath12 emission at the level of @xmath20 @xmath15 @xmath04 for over a decade .",
    "the optical emission , which includes ca  ii and alkali resonance lines , is @xmath21100 times stronger than equivalently classified l dwarfs .",
    "2mass  j1315@xmath02649 also harbors a resolved t dwarf companion , which appears to be too widely separated to induce magnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "kinematics and coevality analyses indicate that this is a mature system ( few gyr ) and that 2mass  j1315@xmath02649a is likely a low mass star just above the hydrogen burning mass limit ( m @xmath21 0.075  m@xmath22 ) .",
    "its strong optical emission therefore contradicts stellar age - activity trends @xcite , again pointing to new magnetic behavior in the ucd regime .    in this letter , we report the detection of quiescent , unpolarized radio emission from 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 at 5.5 ghz based on observations from the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the radio luminosity of this source exceeds all other ucds detected in quiescent emission to date , but is consistent with a lower radio to h@xmath12 luminosity fraction than other l dwarfs . in section  2 we summarize the observations , data analysis and resulting measurements . in section  3",
    "we use these data to infer the properties of the emitting region and compare to other ucd emitters . in section  4",
    "we discuss the possible origins of this emission and propose future observations .",
    "2mass  j1315@xmath02649 was observed with atca in the compact hybrid h214 configuration ( baselines of 0.0825.94 km ) on 14 july 2011 ( ut ) .",
    "continuum observations were taken in dual - sideband mode simultaneously at 5.5 ghz ( c - band ) and 9.0 ghz ( x - band ) .",
    "the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ; @xcite ) was used , providing 2ghz bandwidth per observing frequency in 2048 channels of 1mhz width each .",
    "the source was tracked for a total of 3  hr in 5  min and 10  min intervals , interspersed with observations of the gain calibrator qsob1255 - 316 .",
    "the quasar qsob1934 - 638 was used for primary flux calibration , while qsob0823 - 500 was used for bandpass calibration .",
    "data were reduced using the astronomical image processing system package ( aips ; @xcite ) following best practices for wide - band data reduction .",
    "images of the 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 field from the integrated broadband 5.5  ghz and 9.0  ghz data are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] , with synthesized beam sizes ( @xmath23 ) of @xmath1530@xmath24 and @xmath1525@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "several significant sources are seen in each field , but in the 5.5  ghz data there is one source centered at ( 13@xmath2515@xmath2629@xmath2799 , @xmath026@xmath2849@xmath2955@xmath307)@xmath1(0@xmath2712 , 2@xmath300 ) that is coincident with the proper - motion - corrected position of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 to within 2@xmath8.4 northeast of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 is nvss  j131549 - 264647 ( @xcite ; @xmath31 = 13.8@xmath10.6  mjy , @xmath32  mjy ) .",
    "its dirty beam pattern was cleaned using standard aips routines , and does not contribute to the flux detected at the position of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 . ]",
    "this source has an integrated flux density of @xmath33 = 370@xmath150  @xmath2jy , a 7.4@xmath8 detection .",
    "we rule out source confusion as the origin of this emission by noting that the deep 5  ghz survey of the lockman hole by measured a source density of @xmath34 = 0.04  arcmin@xmath35 for @xmath36 350  @xmath2jy , implying a confusion probability @xmath37 @xmath15 1% for this source .",
    "no equivalent source is detected in the 9.0  ghz data to a 5@xmath8 limiting flux of 290  @xmath2jy .",
    "the 5.5  ghz emission from 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 appears to be roughly constant over the observing period . dividing the data into two equally - spaced periods yields consistent fluxes of 430@xmath160  @xmath2jy and 340@xmath170  @xmath2jy .",
    "further division fails to yield a significant detection on timescales of 10  s to 1  hr , indicating a bursting flux limit of @xmath110.5  mjy ( @xmath111.3  mjy ) for a 30  min ( 5  min ) event , timescales typical of previously observed radio bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a suggestion of spectral structure in the emission , as division of the time - integrated flux is slightly dominated by the lowest frequency channels ( @xmath385.2  ghz ) , consistent with a negative power - law spectral slope ( see below ) .",
    "however , these differences are not statistically significant .",
    "we also detect no significant polarization in the emission , with a stokes @xmath39 3@xmath8 limit of @xmath3834% .",
    "the magnitude of the radio emission from 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 is remarkable , particularly given the late spectral types of its components . for the following ,",
    "we assume the emission arises from the l5 primary ( see section  4 for discussion on possible contribution from the secondary ) .",
    "the absolute radio intensity at 5.5  ghz is @xmath40 = @xmath41 = ( 1.6@xmath10.6)@xmath410@xmath42 erg  s@xmath6  hz@xmath6 based on the estimated @xmath43 = 19@xmath13  pc distance of the 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 system . parameterizing the radio power as @xmath3 , we find for @xmath44 = 5.5  ghz and @xmath45 for @xmath46 5.5 ghz , and integrating over 6 decibels about 5.5 ghz",
    ", we derive a statistically equivalent @xmath47 = ( 1.5@xmath10.5)@xmath410@xmath48  erg  s@xmath6 . ]",
    "@xmath47 = ( 9@xmath13)@xmath410@xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath7 = @xmath05.44@xmath10.22 assuming a bolometric luminosity of @xmath49 = @xmath04.19@xmath10.16 for the primary @xcite .",
    "the lack of emission at 9.0  ghz implies a power - law slope in the radio flux @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "this index is broadly consistent with the radio spectra of other ucds @xcite , with the exception of the flat - spectrum radio source 2mass  j1314 + 1320 @xcite .",

    "we find 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 to be the most radio - luminous quiescent emitter among this group , comparable to the peak fluxes detected among ucd radio outbursts . its brightness is consistent with no appreciable decline in radio power with spectral type well into the l dwarf class , at least for radio - loud ucds .",
    "no x - ray measurement has yet been made of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 , but we can infer that it likely violates the guedel - benz relation since it would require an x - ray luminosity @xmath56 @xmath15 29.7  erg  s@xmath6 , or @xmath57 ( this is also true for the secondary ) .",
    "active m and l dwarfs typically have @xmath58 @xcite , so even with its strong optical emission 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 likely has @xmath59 and @xmath60  hz@xmath6 , violating the guedel - benz relation by nearly four orders of magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratios ] also displays the ( asynchronous ) ratio of radio and h@xmath12 luminosities for ucds observed to date .",
    "this ratio steadily increases from late - m to mid - l types , in both quiescent and flaring fluxes , reflecting the decline in optical emission and plateau in radio emission with later spectral type .",
    "nearly all l and t dwarfs appear to emit more nonthermal power in the radio than in optical lines .",
    "2mass  j1315@xmath02649 is a obvious exception ; its strong h@xmath12 emission implies @xmath61 ( taking into account scatter in the h@xmath12 measurements ) , a ratio more in line with mid- and late - m dwarfs .",
    "given that no later - type source has yet been detected in quiescent flux ( the t6.5 2mass  j1047 + 2124 has only been detected in outburst ; @xcite ) , we can only speculate as to whether this measurement reflects a change in the nonthermal emission spectrum of ucds at lower temperatures or the unique nature of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 itself .",
    "the lack of measurable polarization or variability during our 3  hr observation of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 suggests that its radio emission may be driven by incoherent gyrosychrotron emission , as has been previously proposed for quiescent ucd radio sources @xcite .",
    "this emission peaks at high harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath62  mhz , where @xmath63 = 10100 , @xmath64 is local magnetic field strength in gauss , and @xmath65 is the electron cyclotron frequency . assuming @xmath66 5  ghz implies @xmath67  g , on par with prior estimates for ucd radio emission regions @xcite .",
    "razin - tsytovich suppression also provides a constraint on the electron number density , requiring @xmath68  hz , or @xmath69",
    "@xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "the emitting region scalelength ( @xmath72 ) is constrained by the brightness temperature of the emission , @xmath73  k , which can not exceed the effective temperature of the emitting electrons with @xmath74 = 2 ( consistent with @xmath75 ) , @xmath76  kev , @xmath63 = 10100 , and that the emission is viewed perpendicular to the field ; see eqn .",
    "37 of . ] , t@xmath77 @xmath78  k @xmath15 0.11  mev .",
    "this constraint yields @xmath79 13  r@xmath80 , or 13 stellar radii , a scale that is comparable to resolved radio sources associated with m dwarf coronae and orders of magnitude smaller than the 2mass  j1315@xmath02649ab separation ( @xmath1510@xmath81 radii ) .",
    "this scale size is also equivalent to the corotation orbital radius @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath15 @xmath84  r@xmath80 is the radius beyond which gravitational force can not provide the necessary centripetal acceleration for solid body rotation with period @xmath85 . ] for a 0.08  m@xmath86 ucd dwarf with a rotation period of 1.6  hr , suggesting that if 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 is a rapid rotator ( its rotation period is currently unknown ) , coronal stripping may play a role in the emission geometry @xcite . assuming the presence of a dipole field that scales as @xmath87",
    ", these values suggest a surface field of roughly 15  kg , on par with zeeman broadening measurements of late - m and l dwarf photospheres @xcite .",
    "thus , gyrosynchrotron emission is a viable mechanism for the radio emission of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 , provided that it has a sufficiently large magnetic field strength and structure .",
    "@xcite have proposed an alternative mechanism for ucd radio emission , electron cyclotron masers ( ecm ; @xcite ) arising from plasma cavities near magnetic poles .",
    "ecm operates when @xmath88 , and thus favors environments with low electron densities and large field strengths like those of ucd atmospheres .",
    "indeed , the increasingly neutral photospheres associated with declining photospheric temperatures has been proposed as an explanation for the decline in optical and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "ecm provides a natural explanation for the highly - polarized , rotationally - modulated bursts observed in , e.g. , tvlm  513 - 46546 and lsr  j1835 + 3529 , but @xcite also argue that unpolarized , broadband , quiescent emission may arise if ecm radiation is dispersed in the ambient plasma or emitted from several discrete maser sources across the stellar surface",
    ". dispersion may be particularly relevant in the magnetosphere of 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 as its persistent and strong h@xmath12 emission indicates a heating source for coronal plasma ; dispersion may have also enhanced its radio detectability if orientation effects are important @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if plasma densities in the source region exceed @xmath89  @xmath70 for a 13  kg field , both ecm and gyrosynchrotron emission may be suppressed .",
    "the calculations above have implicitly assumed that the emission arises from the l5 primary , but the resolution of atca can not rule out emission from the closely - separated t7 companion ( 338  mas ; @xcite ) , which has a similar spectral type as the t6.5 radio source 2mass  j10475385 + 2124234 ( hereafter 2mass  j1047 + 2124 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assert that significant nonthermal emission from the secondary is unlikely , however , as this would require a very high , sustained radio luminosity ( @xmath903.8 , on par with the peak emission during the rapid bursts from 2mass  j1047 + 2124 ) , as well as an h@xmath12 luminosity that would exceed its bolometric luminosity ( @xmath20 @xmath15 + 1.6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , resolved vlbi radio imaging of this binary could resolve the source(s ) of emission , and potentially enable short - term astrometric orbit measurements to constrain both the component masses and the system age.2649ab has a projected semi - major axis of 6.6  au and estimated orbital period of @xmath2150  yr , implying a circular orbital velocity of 0.8  au  yr@xmath6 .",
    "for a relative astrometric precision of @xmath21100  @xmath2as , vlbi could in principle detect orbital motion on a daily basis . ]    the radio emission from 2mass  j1315@xmath02649 may prove to be a critical test of the gyrosynchrotron and ecm models , given the strength of the quiescent emission , the low photospheric temperature ( for either component ) , and evidence of a significant chromosphere .",
    "more extensive monitoring of this source is needed to assess whether and over what time scale the radio emission may be variable , which would constrain the length scale of the emission and hence @xmath91 ; and also determine whether periodic bursting emission is present , direct evidence of a coherent emission process .",
    "coincident monitoring of h@xmath12 , radio and broadband emission would also probe the connection between photospheric and chromospheric structure ; studies of structural connection for other ucds have so far proven inconclusive @xcite . this oddball l dwarf may hold the key to understanding magnetic emission in ucds in general .",
