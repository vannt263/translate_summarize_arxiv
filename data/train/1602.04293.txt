    "in the last decades , high - z quasar surveys have discovered supermassive black holes  ( smbhs ) with @xmath11 at @xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which pose questions about the earliest coevolution of smbhs and their host galaxies .",

    "in order to discriminate them , it is important to clarify observational signatures of rapidly growing high - z bhs in the light of the capability of ongoing and upcoming facilities .    here , we focus on high - z smbh formation through collapse of supermassive stars  ( smss ) with @xmath13 .",

    "however , given the field of view ( @xmath19 for jwst nircam ) , a blind search is not necessarily an efficient way to identify newborn dcbhs and their host halos because dcbh formation may be rare in the early universe .",

    "we briefly estimate the rate of such high - z tdes . the comoving number density of smss or dcbhs in the early growth is estimated to be @xmath224 for @xmath1  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath225 of such systems in the sky . given @xmath226 tdes by each dcbh and a jet beaming factor of @xmath227 , the total rate at @xmath228",
    "is estimated to be a few @xmath229 .",
    "note that uncertainties of the dcbh number density are fairly large at this stage and can be significantly larger than the above value  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , if the inward migration of the stars before joining the cluster is more efficient , the size of the star cluster becomes significantly smaller than the disk fragmentation radius , in which case the tde rate is enhanced . on the other hand",
    ", relativistic jets may not accompany in some cases e.g. , due to absence of large - scale magnetic field amplification in the tde disk .",
    "in fact , off - axis radio afterglow observations of local tdes suggest that only @xmath230 of them are accompanied by powerful relativistic jets  @xcite .",
    "we analytically calculate properties of a nuclear accretion disk around a direct collapse black hole  ( dcbh ) within a few myr after its formation .",
    "the outer disk is gravitationally unstable and fragments into clumps at @xmath3 .",
    "the clumps evolve into pop iii stars with a typical mass of @xmath231 , which will form a dens star cluster .",
    "the relaxation time of the cluster is estimated to be @xmath232 and shorter than the stellar lifetime of a few myr .",
    "we can expect that @xmath226 of massive meal - poor stars are tidally disrupted by each dcbh .",
    "if a relativistic jet is launched by such a tidal disruption event , bright x - ray transients with a duration of a few months to @xmath131 yr could be produced and detectable by _ swift _ bat and erosita even from @xmath10 . given a formation rate of dcbhs @xmath224",
    ", the all sky event rate could be a few times per year , although the uncertainties are fairly large . around the time when the dcbh mass is doubled ,",
    "gas accretion will be strongly suppressed by various agn feedback effects ; the radiative and mechanical feedback from the inner slim disk , star cluster , and tde jets , which can be probed by follow - up observations by evla and jwst .",
