    "in the field of solid state physics , in particular physics of defects , the legacy of ekkehart krner who died ten years ago at the age of @xmath0 , is invaluable .",
    "he has been actively publishing for @xmath1 years , mostly as a single author , on the physical understanding of defective solids , but also on their mathematical structure .",
    "one could make a distinction between a first series of paper @xcite-@xcite where he constructs an original approach to understand dislocations , and a later series @xcite-@xcite where he raises questions , while reporting new knowledge in the field .",
    "most of the theory can be found in the course @xcite but since krner also distilled many comments , ideas , and computations along other publications , the idea of writing the present tribute grew up .",
    "it is especially intended to commemorate the @xmath2 anniversary of his death , in order , not to recall ( because the author has no privileged relationship with krner to do so ) , but to enlighten krner s ideas and show how they are found rich enough by the author to be diffused , revisited and emphasized today .",
    "it should be pointed out that anthony @xcite is one of krner s direct students who also greatly contributed to understand defect lines ( in particular , disclinations ) . since then",
    ", many contributions to the field ( nonlinear dislocations , dislocation motion , thermodynamic of defective crystals etc ) have appeared , but surprisingly enough , few only cite krner .",
    "this is probably due to the lack of real school following him , but also due to scientific reasons : indeed , krner s theory is formulated in physical terms , but appeals to complex mathematical concepts , the combination of which is only rarely seen in the literature .",
    "it should be emphasized that de len , epstein , lazar , maugin and co - authors @xcite ( cf . the well - documented survey @xcite and the references therein ) have produced significant results not only by following , but especially by completing the ideas of krner .",
    "so , the present paper is intended to ( i ) collect and show krner s results in the light of a new presentation , ( ii ) describe the non - riemannian crystal and show how it can help to select appropriate deformation and internal ( thermodynamic ) variables , ( iii ) participate to the debate around krner s question : `` what are the dynamical variables of our theory ? ''",
    "@xcite    it will be especially stressed that the crystal geometry and the physical laws governing defects are inseparable , as is the case in the einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "however , we entirely agree with noll when he writes @xcite that `` the geometry [ must be ] the natural outcome , not the first assumption , of the theory '' ( i.e. , as in the _ continuous distribution of dislocation _ ( cdd ) theory of bilby at al .",
    "@xcite ) . many geometrical tools and mathematical theory required for a rigourous description of the dislocated crystal geometry can be found in the landmark papers by noll @xcite and wang @xcite , while also pointing out a recent book on continuum mechanics in that spirit @xcite .",
    "the approach followed here and detailled in @xcite-@xcite is nonetheless distinct from the cdd theory .",
    "single crystals growing from the melt are considered where high temperature gradients are unavoidable and hence where point defects are present @xcite . moreover , since there are no internal boundaries , the defect lines can take in principle any orientation while forming either loops or lines ending at the crystal boundary .",
    "however , for the purpose of simplicity in the exposition of the theory , we will consider a tridimensional crystal filled with a network of rectilinear parallel disclinations and/or dislocations .",
    "particular to the chosen approach is the distinction between scales , where the macroscale is recovered from the mesoscale by a homogenization process : the singularities ( i.e. , the defect lines ) have been erased and hence the density of defects ( dislocations and/or disclinations ) are recovered by means of smooth fields which we will show responsible for curvature and torsion of the crystal intrisic geometry .",
    "also , the density of point defects will show responsible for the appearance of non - metric terms . in this approach ,",
    "only objective fields are considered to describe defective matter : they are defined across scales although their physical meaning might differ . moreover , no elasto - plastic decomposition and no prescription of any reference configuration are required , and there is no assumption of static equilibrium ( vanishing stress divergence ) .",
    "in this paper , a scalar , vector or tensor of any order are not typographically distinct symbols in the text .",
    "the tensor order is specified when equations are written , since in this case only , the vector @xmath3 is written as @xmath4 ( with one index ) , and the tensor @xmath5 as @xmath6 with a number of indices corresponding to its order .",
    "the present section focuses on the mesoscopic scale , where dislocations and disclinations are lines and whose characteristic length is some average distance between neighboring defects . the remaining of the medium is a continuum governed by linear elasticity . at time @xmath7 , the body is referred to as @xmath8 to represent any random sample corresponding to a given crystal growth experiment . in the crystal domain @xmath9 , the meso - scale physics will then be represented by a nowhere dense set of defect lines which in @xmath10 are parallel to each other .",
    "[ lines2d ] at the meso - scale , a @xmath10 set of dislocations and/or disclinations @xmath11 is a closed set of @xmath9 ( this meaning the intersection with @xmath9 of a closed set of @xmath12 ) formed by a countable union of parallel lines @xmath13 , whose adherence is itself a countable union of lines and where the linear elastic strain is singular . in the sequel",
    ", these lines will be assumed as parallel to the @xmath14-axis .    since accumulation points",
    "( to be understood as clusters of parallel lines ) might appear , the scale of matter description of this section is named continuum scale .",
    "the present mesoscopic theory is developed from the sole linear elastic strain , which itself is defined from the stress field ( although the stress - strain relationship is not used in the sequel ) and therefore is an objective internal field .",

    "following kondo @xcite , by calling a crystal `` perfect '' , it is meant that the atoms form , in its stress - free configuration , a regular pattern proper to the prescribed nature of the matter . however , no real crystal is perfect , but rather filled with point and line defects which interact mutually .",
    "each defect type is responsible for a particular geometric property , as will be described in this paper . in order to reach this crystal ,",

    "since the term inside the parenthesis is symmetric in @xmath198 and @xmath199 , we have @xcite : @xmath200 } ( { \\bf{e_k}})_l+\\nabla_p({\\bf{e_k}})_l t_{p;mq}\\right)ds_p=\\int_{s}\\epsilon_{pqm}\\frac{1}{2}r_{l;nmq}({\\bf{e_k}})_nds_p,\\label{internmotion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definition of the riemannian curvature tensor @xmath201 where by ( [ curv ] ) & ( [ connexion ] ) , @xmath202 and @xmath203 denote the riemann curvature tensors associated to @xmath112 and @xmath204 , respectively .    by ( [ internmotion ] ) ,",
    "the internal observer is convinced to return to his startpoint while the external observer however can see the gap as created by the crystal curvature , itself resulting from the presence of defects .",
    "let us remark that in the absence dislocations ( @xmath205 ) , the gap is merely due to curvature effects with a curvature tensor directly related by ( [ etakmacro ] ) to the disclination density by @xmath206 .",
    "it should however be noted that in the absence of disclinations , the curvature is not vanishing but depends on the sole contortion , since from ( [ etakmacro ] ) & ( [ curv2 ] ) , @xmath207 where by theorem [ deltagamma ] , @xmath203 is linearly related to the contortion .",
    "it is computed from ( [ curv4 ] ) that the ricci and gauss curvatures @xcite read @xmath208 while einstein tensor reads @xmath209 in the presence of dislocations and disclinations , thereby contradicting krner who identified einstein tensor with the disclination density in @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the macroscopic strain can be decomposed into ( symmetric ) compatible and ( symmetric ) solenoidal parts @xcite , where only the second one as denoted by @xmath210 is relevant for the incompatibility tensor , it results that its trace @xmath211 satisfies by ( [ gauss ] ) @xmath212 , thereby showing how the gauss curvature is related to the variation of matter density .",
    "the crystal equiped with @xmath213 has the following properties : ( i ) the geodesics of @xmath177 are the crystallographic lines ; ( ii ) the effect of parallel displacement of the internal observer ( equiped with @xmath177 ) along a crystallographic line is equivalent to counting the lattice steps ; ( iii ) the defect content , i.e. disclination and/or dislocation densities can be computed from measures of @xmath177 only ; ( iv ) the torsion of @xmath177 is merely due to the presence of dislocations , while its curvature is due to the presence of both disclinations and dislocations ; ( v ) in the absence of disclinations , there exists a single - valued rotation and distortion field ; ( vi ) if and only if there are no defect lines , @xmath177 is euclidean and there exists a holonomic coordinate system . in the latter case",
    "only , one can properly speak of a reference configuration , of single - valued rotation , displacement and distortion fields , with the macroscopic strain compatible with the displacement field .",
    "figure [ geom ] illustrate the inseparable link between physics and geometry . on the one hand , the physical fields can be set apart : the deformation and defect internal variables are shown in rectangular and hexagonal boxes , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the purely geometrical object are in oval boxes .",
    "the double boundary line means that the quantity contains differential combinations of other fields ( as connected by arrows ) , while single lines mean algebraic combinations only .",
    "the main deformation field is the strain , while the distortion and rotation are only obtained in the absence of disclinations ( see theorem [ elasticrotdist ] ) .",
    "because they depend on an arbitrary point where there value is assumed known , they are considered inappropriate as model variables . concerning defect internal variables , one could indifferently chose the dislocation torsion or contortion . let us mention that since strain instead of distortion is chosen , the deformation and defect variables should be considered as independent physical fields .",
    "let us first remark that the notions of metric and of connection must be considered as distinct .",
    "this has been emphasized in @xcite where it is recalled that historically it has not been so for a long time ( including einstein literature ) .",
    "here , we have seen that the metric is attached to the notion of external observer , while the connection is attached to the notion of parallel displacement of the internal observer inside the crystal .",
    "we have seen that parallel displacement with @xmath112 and counting - step measurements are the same in a crystal filled with line defects .",
    "this was true because @xmath112 was compatible with @xmath189 and hence crystallographic basis elements remain crystallographic as transported along the crystallographic lines .",
    "suppose now that the crystal also contains point defects . according to krner @xcite , `` nonmetricity means that length measurements are disturbed .",
    "it is easy to see that this just occurs in the presence of point defects .",
    "in fact , when counting atomic steps along crystallographic lines to measure distance between two atoms , [ the internal observer ] feels disturbed when suddently a vacancy or an intersticial emerges instead of another atoms [ of the perfect crystal ] . ''",
    "let @xmath214 and @xmath215 be the scalar vacancy ( resp .",
    "interstitial ) concentration , that is the number of vacancies ( resp .",
    "interstitials ) per unit volume of crystal . then , the following metric as proposed by krner @xcite : @xmath216 verifies @xmath217 , with @xmath218 the volume element of the stress - free crystal and @xmath219 that of the actual one , and where @xmath220 is the excess atomic content of @xmath219",
    ". an evolution equation for @xmath214 and @xmath215 ( and hence for @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) will be given in section [ concl ] .",
    "it is clear that the non - metricity defined as @xmath223 @xcite must now enter the geometric point- and line - defect model .",
    "differentiation @xmath224 is here intended with respect to connection @xmath225 , as defined by @xmath226 with @xmath118 given by ( [ torsion ] ) & ( [ contortion ] ) and where @xmath227 and @xmath228 since @xmath229 is a tensor quantity , it is expected to play a role for the physical description of the crystal ( and to obey an evolution equation as related to the other defects ) .",
    "the paradox of the flat crystal is the fact that a defective solids with in addition to defect lines a certain amount of point defects can recover a vanishing curvature if the following balance holds : @xmath230 where the three terms are the curvature of @xmath231 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "this is what krner ( and bilby et al @xcite ) calls teleparallelism , by this meaning that the global connection curvature vanishes and hence that the internal observer ends up parallel when travelling along a loop .",
    "it should be emphasized that teleparallelism is often considered as a working assumption @xcite .",
    "however , we rather follow krner @xcite when he says that `` curved crystals are possible only if the curvature is , in some sense , compatible with the considered crystal structure '' , which means that instead of a flat crystal given by ( [ curv6 ] ) , the connection curvature @xmath232 of the actual crystal should be such that point and line defects accomodate to satisfy @xmath233 particularizing ( [ curv7 ] ) we learn from identity @xmath234;lk}+t_{p : mq}q_{p;lk}=0 $ ] @xcite that point defects and dislocations must be geometrically related , which phenomena is well known from solid - state physicist : `` dislocations moving perpendicular to their burgers vector produce point defects , and similar processes occur when dislocations cut each other '' @xcite ( concerning non metricity , see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us conclude by attempting to answer krner s question of the introduction . to the knowledge of the author , this question has not been answered yet , or to say the least , there is still no agreement on the answer .",
    "in fact it depends of the physics which one wants to capture . if motion of dislocations is modelled , then not only the conservative glide but also the non - conservative climb mode must be taken into account .",
    "non conservation is due to the presence , creation , anihilation and motion of point defects , and these processes require high temperatures and non - negligible temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "therefore a complete model of dislocation motion must be thermodynamical , away from thermal equilibrium ( i.e. irreversible ) , and coupled with the motion of point defects . in @xcite the following set of pdes showed very good results to model point defects : @xmath235 with the lagrangian derivative @xmath236 , and where @xmath237 and @xmath238 mean ( scalar ) concentration , ( tensorial ) equilibrium diffusion , thermodiffusion and ( scalar ) recombination ( @xmath239 for interstitials and @xmath240 for vacancies ) .    concerning the motion of dislocations ( we assume here that disclinations are negligible ) , a similar equation as ( [ eqci ] ) should be proposed , with an inter - dislocation recombination term and a term of interaction with point defects , collectively denoted by @xmath241 ( also appearing in ( [ eqci ] ) ) .",
    "however , the dislocation density can not be scalar ( which is the case in most of the current models available in the literature ) but must be the tensorial @xmath242 ( or equivalently the contortion @xmath77 ) .",
    "the pde could read @xmath243 with appropriate boundary condition and where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are tensor diffusivities of order @xmath246 . moreover",
    "the contortion verifies the conservation law @xcite @xmath247 , meaning that the mesoscopic dislocations are loops or end at the crystal boundary , in such a way that eq .",
    "( [ eqdisloc ] ) amounts to a system of @xmath147 coupled pdes .",
    "moreover the expression of @xmath241 must somehow satisfy the geometric interaction between defects as given by ( [ curv7 ] ) .",
    "incompatibility is the final quantity as obtained by recursive differentiation of either the strain ( twice ) , or the contortion ( once ) .",
    "it hence shows the ultimate convergence of the initially set apart deformation and defect variables .",
    "the other oval boxes denote defect variables obtained from the two key model variables : strain and contortion .",
    "it should be observed that all relations between strain @xmath71 , frank tensor @xmath248 , contortion @xmath77 and incompatibility are obtained by means of recursive application of the curl operator ( either @xmath249 or @xmath250 ) .    as a first step , krner proposed an ( `` athermal '' ) gibbs free energy reading @xmath251 with @xmath252 the elastic deformation gradient . restricting hence to statics , he thereby attempted to answer his question @xcite : `` what are the independent ( extensive ) [ explicit state ] variables entering the free energy ( at constant temperature ) ? '' however in @xcite , he recognizes that the use of @xmath252 is inevitably ambiguous because the elasto - plastic decomposition is not unique .    according to our theory ,",
    "the free energy naturally reads from the diagram on fig .",
    "[ physics ] as a first strain gradient ( see @xcite ) model @xmath253 where the strain gradient is however replaced by its curl .",
    "equivalently it could read @xmath254 by combination of the last two variables of @xmath255 , or even @xmath256 by combination of the first two variables of @xmath257 .",
    "let us observe that according to theorem [ elasticrotdist ] , @xmath258 can nevertheless be compared with @xmath259 as soon as @xmath260 is identified with a distortion ( i.e. a deformation gradient ) , although not becessarily the elastic one ( cf . remark [ seulconn ] ) . moreover , a curl differential relation is also observed between @xmath258 last two variables ( cf .",
    "remark [ remark5 ] ) .",
    "a recent thermodynamic analysis with @xmath258 has been remarkably reported by berdichevsky @xcite where @xmath260 is identified with the plastic distortion .",
    "let us remark however that by ( [ disclindens ] ) & ( [ dislocdens ] ) , @xmath260 is not , because of the prescription of the arbirary @xmath24 , an unambiguous state variable , as opposed to @xmath261 .",
    "they are however reasons to be tempted by the choice @xmath262 because ( i ) all variables are explicit state variables defined by objective fields ( which do not appeal to reference configurations , arbitrary plastic parts , or points @xmath24 ) , ( ii ) there is a distinction between ( strain - like ) deformation and ( internal ) defect variables , ( iii ) all variables have clear and unambiguous physical and a geometrical meanings . if needed , all other variables ( such as @xmath263 ) can be recovered as implicit state variables of the model @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if applying the curl operator twice to the strain and once to the contortion , then the only additional model variable naturally appearing is the incompatibility , of both deformation and defect nature .",
    "this sounds like a closure on the recursive iteration for ( higher - order ) models .",
    "nonetheless , we rather prefer to introduce incompatibility through krner s formula ( [ etakmacro ] ) as a constraint to the gibbs energy with @xmath147 degrees of freedom as coupling strain , frank tensor and contortion : @xmath264 while the equilibrium law writes as the following equation with @xmath61 d.o.f .",
    ": @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the sum of external forces and of configurational ( internal ) pseudo - forces directly related to @xmath77 and to the derivative of the so - called dislocation moment stress @xmath267 @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that the additional constraint of incompressibility must be added in order to avoid climb and point defects @xcite .",
    "also , a remarkable discussion on the nature of @xmath268 ( with identification of @xmath260 with the distortion ) in a nonlinear and variational setting can be found in @xcite .",
    "summarizing , an athermal model of dislocations requires to solve equations ( [ eqdisloc])-([equ ] ) which involve a total of @xmath146 degrees of feedom .",
    "this number is exactly the number of d.o.f .",
    "required by the internal observer to parallel displace inside the crystal ( through the nonsymmetric connexion ) .",
    "moreover to be closed the theory must involve point and line defects , and hence must consider high temperature and temperature gradients .",
    "so , as recognized by krner @xcite , the dislocation model must be cast within the general frame of irreversible thermodynamics because the time variations of the internal variables create thermal dissipation .",
    "this is the main reason why a huge work remains to be done in order to determine , e.g. , the stress - strain relation , all other constitutive laws , the diffusion coefficients ( which depend on the crystal internal symmetries , glide planes , etc ) , and the defect interaction / production terms .",
    "the author is unable to answer definitely any of these questions but will pursue research on the topic .",
    "this paper aims at recalling ekkehart krner s legacy , and in particular the fundamental questions he raised which are still open and crucial nowadays .",
    "it is also aimed at stressing that solutions to dislocation modelling will most probably arise from a strong interplay between mathematics and physics , as remarkably done by krner along his papers @xcite-@xcite .",
