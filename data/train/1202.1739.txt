    "<S> we present further and more compelling evidence of the existence of @xmath0 , a light boson that most probably couples exclusively to quarks and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> observations presented in a prior paper will be rediscussed for completeness .    in a recent paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we presented a variety of indications of the possible existence of a light boson with a mass of about 38 mev , henceforth referred to as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these indications amounted to a series of low - statistics observations all pointing in the same direction , which will be discussed here anew , for completeness . </S>",
    "<S> however intriguing , the pieces just did not yet add up to a full and clear picture in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this letter , we present three more pieces of evidence , one of which being considerably more conclusive owing to the much higher statistics . </S>",
    "<S> however , the latter data do not confirm the existence of recurrencies of @xmath0 , as previously @xcite suggested .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we made notice of an apparent interference effect around the @xmath1 threshold in the invariant - mass distribution of @xmath2 events , which we observed in preliminary radiation data of the babar collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect , with a periodicity of about 74 mev , could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of 190 mev of the @xmath3 pair , as in the model of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and that of the gluon cloud . </S>",
    "<S> later , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we reported evidence of small oscillations in electron - positron and proton - antiproton annihilation data , with a periodicity of 76@xmath42 mev , independent of the beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> the latter observations are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ interference ] .    amongst the various scenarios to explain the phenomenon presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one was rather intriguing , namely the postulated existence of gluonic oscillations , possibly surface oscillations , with a frequency of about 38 mev . </S>",
    "<S> these would then , upon interfering with the universal quarkonia frequency @xmath5 mev @xcite , lead to the observed oscillations .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     these data seem to have enough statistics to substantiate the existence of a light boson with mass around 40 mev .    with this latest piece of evidence of @xmath0 , we conclude that it is now necessary to establish its mass and other properties by further experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we think that @xmath0 is the light scalar higgs - type boson which was proposed in a model describing the unification of electromagnetic and strong interactions @xcite . furthermore , we believe that it consists of a micro - universe filled with glue , as formulated in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , as @xmath0 appears to couple to quarks proportionally to their masses , its coupling to the top quark is expected to be quite strong . </S>"
