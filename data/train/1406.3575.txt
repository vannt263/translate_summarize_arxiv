    "<S> the spectrum of electrons from muons decaying in an atomic bound state is significantly modified by their interaction with the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat unexpectedly , its first measurement , at the canadian laboratory triumf , differed from basic theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show , using a combination of techniques developed in atomic , nuclear , and high - energy physics , that radiative corrections eliminate the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to solving that outstanding problem , our more precise predictions are potentially useful for interpreting future high - statistics muon experiments that aim to search for exotic interactions at @xmath0 sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> muons are very special elementary particles . </S>",
    "<S> they exhibit essentially the same electroweak interactions as electrons ; however , their much larger mass ( @xmath1 ) endows them with some important features . </S>",
    "<S> most noteworthy is the free muon decay rate which stems from its decay mode @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the differential decay rate as a function of the electron energy @xcite ( neglecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 effects @xcite ) is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 is the fermi constant , and @xmath8 represents rather large , complicated radiative corrections that can significantly modify the electron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath8 is explicitly given  by    @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_\\mu}{m_e}\\right )    + ( 6 - 4 x ) \\left[\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{1 } } 2 \\text{li}_2(x)-2\\ln^2 ( x ) +   \\ln ( x )   \\right . </S>",

    "<S> these large corrections vanish when integrated over the electron energy , as expected , due to the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental lifetime of a @xmath11 stopped in matter , @xmath12 s ( the most precise lifetime measurement for any unstable state @xcite ) determines the strength of weak interactions quantified by @xmath13 . comparing it with the fine - structure constant and other high - precision electroweak observables , led to predictions for the top - quark and higgs - scalar masses , before their discovery .    </S>",
    "<S> what happens when a @xmath14 , rather than a @xmath11 , is slowed down in matter ? in vacuum the @xmath11 and @xmath15 lifetimes must be the same @xcite ; but in matter , their decays can appear quite different . </S>",
    "<S> as the @xmath15 loses energy and starts to come to rest , it gets bound to nuclei of charge @xmath16 due to their attractive coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 quickly cascades down to the lowest 1s atomic orbital , where it remains in a quantum wave function with a momentum distribution for which its average velocity is @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the decreased energy of the bound muon causes the decay - in - orbit ( dio ) rate to slow down . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the electron produced in the decay feels the same binding interaction , which increases its wave function near the decay region , and thus the decay probability . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these two effects approximately cancel @xcite due to electromagnetic gauge invariance , and the difference between the overall decay rates of free and bound @xmath15 is mainly due to the time dilation resulting from the bound muon s motion . </S>",
    "<S> ( in matter , a @xmath15 can also undergo capture , @xmath18 , which changes its effective lifetime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not discuss that process here . )    while coulombic interactions with the nucleus do not significantly modify the overall dio rate ( about a 0.5% reduction from time dilation ) , they do make important changes to the spectrum of decay electrons .    as a result of the muon s velocity distribution , the spectrum in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) is doppler shifted and smeared . </S>",
    "<S> these effects render the radiative corrections embodied in @xmath8 quite complicated . </S>",
    "<S> although , as mentioned before , radiative corrections to the electron energy spectrum of a free muon decay are completely known up to second order in perturbation theory @xcite , no analysis of radiative corrections for a bound muon decay has been performed up to now . </S>",
    "<S> methods traditionally used to calculate the dio spectrum can not be simply extended to allow for the inclusion of radiative corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the above effects , nuclear - recoil on dio leads to a very small high - energy tail in the spectrum , extending all the way to electron energies @xmath19 , well above the @xmath20 end - point energy of free muon decay at rest . </S>",
    "<S> although tiny , the dio events near @xmath21 are an important background to searches for coherent @xmath22 conversion experiments that will probe for new exotic interactions at @xmath0 sensitivity , four orders of magnitude beyond current bounds @xcite . a precise understanding of dio , not only the very - high - energy tail , but the entire electron spectrum , will be important for calibrating and fully exploiting the intended sensitivity of those experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> leading - order , i.e. excluding radiative corrections , theoretical predictions for the muon dio spectrum , properly incorporating the effects of the coulomb field of the nucleus on the muon decay , as well as the finite nuclear size , have been known for some time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> twist , an experimental muon decay program at triumf , has provided the first precision test of those expectations for a wide range of dio electrons with energies 1870  mev  @xcite using an aluminium stopping target . </S>",
    "<S> although general agreement was found between the twist measurements @xcite and theory @xcite , significant deviations were observed throughout the examined spectrum , particularly in the region around the free decay end point ( @xmath23 mev ) and at low energies 1825  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) corrections were ignored in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the twist measurements seem to be precise enough to be sensitive to these subtle effects . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the twist collaboration noted the need for but lack of suitable radiative corrections for their analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we provide a proper computation of radiative corrections for dio in the aforementioned energy regions .    </S>",
    "<S> why has it taken five years since the completion of the twist experiment for theory to catch up ? </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is in evaluating radiative effects for bound particles , whose interaction with the nucleus can not be treated as a perturbation .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a similar problem has been solved in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , in the context of heavy - quark decays , already 20 years ago . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it was noted that the necessary theoretical framework had existed in yet another area , the formalism of deep - inelastic lepton scattering on nuclei ; in his 1995 lectures shifman wrote `` i see absolutely no reasons why the corresponding theory was worked out only recently and not 20 years ago '' @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal in this paper is to complete this cycle of theoretical developments by applying the main ideas to what should be a simpler case , namely qed . toward that end </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a shape function that can be convoluted with the radiatively corrected free decay spectrum to approximate the effects of atomic binding . </S>",
    "<S> the range of validity for that prescription should extend from roughly @xmath24 ( the free muon decay end point @xcite ) down to much lower energies , regions where spectral discrepancies have been uncovered by the twist collaboration . explaining those differences was , indeed , a major motivation for this work . events with higher energy , resulting from nuclear - recoil effects are very rare , but extremely important near the dio end point @xmath25 where they are a background to searches for `` new physics '' via coherent @xmath22 conversion in atoms @xcite . incorporating radiative corrections in that region </S>",
    "<S> is not covered by our new method and is beyond the scope of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> following schwinger s approach @xcite to bound states , we calculate the muon - energy shift due to the field of the nucleus as an average value of the mass operator in the @xmath26 state . </S>",
    "<S> the optical theorem relates its imaginary part to the muon decay rate . denoting the sum of momenta of the neutrinos by @xmath27 we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the neutrino tensor , and where we can formally write the charged particle tensor as ( we use schwinger s notation @xcite and neglect the electron mass ) @xmath30 we treat the nucleus as a static source of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> recoil - energy effects can be neglected for the range of electron energies considered here , since the recoil energy is @xmath31 , with @xmath32 denoting the nucleus mass . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the high - energy region of the spectrum , recoil - energy effects are not suppressed by @xmath33 , modify the maximum allowed electron energy , and can not be neglected  @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> the dirac wave function , describing the 1s state of the muon , can be approximated in the leading @xmath34 order by its large components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to separate the muon motion inside the atom from the motion of the whole system , we rewrite the covariant derivative as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the four - velocity of the muonic atom ( @xmath36 is timelike and @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 describes the residual motion of the bound muon ; spatial components of @xmath38 are of order @xmath39 , and @xmath40=i e f^{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we now expand the spectrum in the region where @xmath41 ( in the decay of a free muon , @xmath42 would be the four - momentum of the electron ; this condition requires the produced electron to be almost on - shell ) . keeping only the leading corrections in @xmath34 we get @xmath43 we exploit the lightness of the electron and decompose @xmath42 using a lightlike vector @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath47 , we can neglect the term @xmath48 , @xmath49   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\int { \\mathrm d}\\lambda\\ , s(\\lambda ) \\delta(q^2 + 2\\lambda v\\cdot q),\\label{eq : imt } % \\mathrm{im}(t^{\\alpha\\beta})\\sim % \\int { \\mathrm d}\\lambda\\ , s(\\lambda ) \\delta(q^2 + 2\\lambda v\\cdot q ) , % \\label{eq : imt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a qed analog of the shape function @xcite that in our case can be explicitly evaluated using the muon s schrdinger wave function @xmath51 , @xmath52    great simplification can be achieved through a judicious choice of the electromagnetic gauge , reducing the effect of the coulomb interaction on the electron . in the light - cone gauge , @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the muon wave function in momentum space calculated in the light - cone gauge . neglecting terms quadratic in the smearing variable @xmath56 , the delta function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : imt ] ) , describing the electron s on - shell condition , can be rewritten as @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the free muon decay , the on - shell condition for the electron is @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the muon mass and the electron energy can be replaced by @xmath61 and @xmath62 also in the matrix element in front of the delta function , since this introduces a change of higher order in @xmath34 , beyond our target accuracy .    within that accuracy </S>",
    "<S> , the radiative corrections can be included by substituting a matrix element squared including virtual and real radiation for the tree - level expression in front of the integral in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : imt ] ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the dio spectrum becomes a convolution of the shape function with the spectrum of the free - muon decay , in a form familiar from heavy - quark physics @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the differential decay rate of a free muon , including radiative corrections , with a daughter electron carrying energy @xmath65 , and @xmath66 note that we have kept a term quadratic in @xmath34 , arising from the binding energy of the muon , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this term shifts the spectrum , since the maximum energy of the electron is @xmath68 rather than @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> around @xmath70 , the derivative of the spectrum with respect to the energy behaves like @xmath71 , so we need to have the quadratic term in order to obtain the result correct to @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : convolution ] ) is noteworthy in several respects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the final state characterized by the observed value of @xmath73 arises from a superposition of contributions : the energy of the electron is modified by the motion of the muon and by the decay electron s interaction with the nuclear field . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of observing @xmath73 should involve a square of the sum of _ probability amplitudes _ ; but the leading binding correction results in the sum of probabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> second , in our present qed analysis , the shape function is derived from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to qcd , where it was introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , because of strong interactions , the shape function can not be computed . </S>",
    "<S> instead it has to be modelled , and constrained from experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the decay spectrum @xmath74 refers to a _ free electron _ , although we know that its interaction with the nucleus must be accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> information about this interaction is encoded in @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible thanks to gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the light - cone gauge enables us to approximately treat the electron as a free particle .    </S>",
    "<S> as previously remarked , our analysis closely resembles , and uses the techniques employed for , the studies of heavy - quark decays . </S>",
    "<S> separation of disparate physical scales is at the basis of the heavy - quark expansions employed there . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is worth noticing the corresponding energy scales which need to be taken into account when considering muon dio . as is manifest from the derivations presented above , the essential idea is , like in heavy - quark systems , the separation of bound - state energy scales from a hard energy scale , given by @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical bound - state momentum in a muonic atom is given by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the expansion parameter in our computation is given by @xmath77 , which plays a role analogous to @xmath78 in heavy quark effective theory ( where @xmath79 is the qcd scale , and @xmath80 the heavy - quark mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this separation of bound - state effects from the hard scale is no longer possible in the high - energy region of the dio spectrum , @xmath81 . in this region , in order to produce an on - shell electron in the final state , hard photons need to be exchanged between the muon ( or the electron ) and the nucleus . our formalism is therefore expected to work in the energy region @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> a proper treatment of the higher - energy part of the electron spectrum is beyond the scope of this work . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the convolution formula eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : convolution ] ) allows us to calculate only the dominant corrections ; i.e. , it does not include all corrections of order @xmath33 , and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> these sub - leading effects would appear as additional , parametrically suppressed , shape functions . </S>",
    "<S> subleading shape functions have been investigated to some extent in the context of heavy - quark decays , see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and their study is quite involved . the difficulty in treating and estimating the size of these subleading effects in heavy - quark systems is mainly due to the fact that shape functions encode nonperturbative effects in the qcd case . in our qed case the shape function can be derived from first principles , and it is easier to estimate the size of the neglected subleading terms . </S>",
    "<S> to do that , we can ( i ) recompute the shape function by extracting it from a ( fictitious ) two - body bound decay of the muon , which , without considering radiative corrections , can be computed exactly along the lines of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a shape function which coincides with our previous computation at order @xmath34 but contains different higher - order terms . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) compare the muon dio spectrum computed exactly but without radiative corrections , i.e. along the lines of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with the spectrum computed with our convolution formula using the born - level free decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two spectra is due to neglected @xmath83 terms in our shape function . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed both checks , and found that indeed the effect of higher - order terms is always of order @xmath84 , and is never larger than @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this explicitly shows that we can safely neglect subleading shape functions to describe the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the complete order @xmath33 corrections to dio can , in principle , be incorporated by combining the more exact coulombic treatment in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the shape function approach to ordinary radiative corrections described in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the added effect is expected to be relatively small for al with z=13 , but could become important for much larger z.    we also mention that finite - nuclear - size effects are more important in muonic atoms than in usual electronic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the muon , because of its relatively large mass , spends more of its time close to the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the finite size of the nucleus when comparing our results with experimental data , and calculate the muon wave function numerically for an assumed model of charge distribution inside the nucleus . more concretely </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the muon wave function as in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> as expected , the main support of this function comes from the region @xmath91 around @xmath92 , determined by the main support of the muon wave function in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that uncertainties in the modeling of finite - nuclear - size effects were analyzed in ref .  </S>",
