    "quantum degenerate gases are in many ways the ideal quantum many - body system . in an experimental situation",
    "they afford an unprecedented level of control over the system parameters , such as the strength ( and even sign ) of the interaction between the atoms , the geometry of the external trap and the properties of the lattice in which the atoms are loaded .",
    "it is no surprise therefore that bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and degenerate fermi gases are often used as a laboratory to study a host of phenomena from many different areas of physics .",
    "this is especially true in condensed matter physics ; for example , ultracold atoms in an optical lattice can be studied using the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "similarly , a system of trapped fermions tightly confined in one direction invites obvious comparisons with the 2d electron gas @xcite .    without doubt , some of the most striking effects in solid state physics are observed when an external magnetic field is applied to a collection of charged particles .",
    "well known examples include the quantum hall effects in 2d electron gases and the meissner effect in type ii superconductors . as the atoms forming quantum gases are electrically neutral , it is not obvious at a first glance how they might be used to study such effects .",
    "the solution lies in the ability to create artificial magnetic fields .",
    "for example , rotating the system and studying it in the rotating frame is analogous to studying charged particles in a homogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "alternatively , lasers can be used to alter the state - dependent tunneling amplitudes of atoms in an optical lattice to simulate an effective magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "a recent proposal involves the adiabatic motion of lambda - type three level atoms interacting with laser - fields which create a non - degenerate dark state , that is an eigenstate of the atom - laser interaction .",
    "it has been shown that if the atoms interact with a pair of laser beams possessing a relative orbital angular momentum @xcite , then an effective vector potential appears in the effective equation for the atomic wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the corresponding effective magnetic field created is entirely dependent on the form of the incident light , so that by appropriately choosing the light s phase and intensity we can control both the strength and shape ( homogeneous or inhomogeneous ) of the effective magnetic field .",
    "the inherent flexibility of the system allows for wide - ranging studies into the magnetic properties of both degenerate bose and fermi gases , and could provide insight into gauge theories in general .",
    "it is therefore pertinent to gain an understanding of how the fundamental properties of the gas may be modified in the presence of artificial magnetic fields .",
    "a complete analysis must include the excitations , which determine the dynamical behaviour of the system under weak perturbation and are crucial in determining its superfluid properties .",
    "of particular interest are the lowest energy ( or elementary ) excitations , which are collective in nature . in this paper",
    "we calculate the spectra for a trapped 2d bec in both homogenous and non - homogeneous magnetic fields , which are created as described in @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional quantum gases have recently attracted a considerable interest in connection with the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite and the quantum hall effect in clouds of ultracold atoms ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section ii a brief description of the model is given and in section iii we outline how the excitations are calculated . as the interaction between the light and atoms introduces two effective potentials - a vector potential and also a scalar potential - and both have a significant role to play in the dynamics and excitations , we present our results in two parts .",
    "in section iv we assume the external trap has been chosen to counteract the effect of the additional effective trap so that the potential felt by the atoms is completely harmonic .",
    "this allows us to isolate the role of the magnetic field alone on the excitations .",
    "then in section v we include the full effective trapping potential terms and study the excitations numerically . finally in section",
    "vi we discuss and summarise the main results .",
    "we consider a system of three - level atoms charecterized by two hyperfine ground levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 and an electronically excited level @xmath2 interacting with two copropagating resonant laser beams in an eit configuration ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the probe beam , which has coupling strength @xmath3 and is allowed to have angular momentum @xmath4 per photon along the z - axis , drives the transition @xmath5 , whilst the control beam has coupling strength @xmath6 and is concerned with the transition @xmath7 .",
    "these absorption paths destructively interfere to suppress transitions to level @xmath2 , driving the atoms to the dark state superposition of levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the relative phase between the probe and control beam .",
    "if the atoms in the dark state form a bec , then the coupling between the light and the atoms introduces an effective vector potential into the mean - field equation for the atomic wavefunction @xmath11 @xcite :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the effective vector and trapping potentials .",
    "the external trapping potential for the dark state atoms is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the trapping potential for the atoms in hyperfine state @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the atomic interactions , which involve collisions between atoms both of the same and of different electronic state , can be described by a single parameter @xcite @xmath19 here , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-wave scattering length between atoms in the levels @xmath23 and @xmath17 ( @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 is the scattering length of atoms in the same electronic state and @xmath26 corresponds to collisions between atoms in different electronic states .",
    "note that in general the intractions can depend on position since @xmath27 is position dependent .",
    "however , if @xmath27 is small or alternatively if the inter and intra - spieces scattering lengths are equal then @xmath28 is approximately constant throughout the condensate .",

    "the perturbative results agree well with our numerical calculations for the lowest energy excitations but breaks down as we increase @xmath101 and @xmath102 as would be expected since these excitations are no longer slowly varying in space .",
    "the observed shift on the excitation energy levels is reduced as we increase the exponent term @xmath91 in the vector potential from 1 .",
    "this is not surprising as the radial coordinate @xmath139 is @xmath140 and therefore for larger @xmath91 the effective magnetic field becomes more concentrated at the edge and permeates less to the centre of the cloud . as a consequence , the critical @xmath141 for energetic instabilities to occur increases as the exponent @xmath91",
    "is increased .",
    "however , the perturbative treatment is valid only for @xmath142 and so can not be used to predict energetic instabilities .",

    "( [ approxv ] ) represents a uniform shift in the chemical potential throughout the cloud - an effect we can ignore by setting the effective trap minimum to zero - while the third term shifts the harmonic trap frequency downwards .",

    "in the studies of becs subject to an external rotation - equivalent to applying a homogeneous effective magnetic field - the presence of instabilities in the excitation spectra has been shown to play a crucial role in determining the evolution of the condensate , particularly with respect to the nucleation of vortices .",
    "there are two types of instability which ought to be considered .",
    "dynamic instabilities are associated with a complex excitation energy and departure from the initial configuration due to interaction effects .",
    "the energetic instability relates to the existence of excitations with negative energy , so that in the presence of dissipation the system can lower its energy by going into an ` anomolous ' mode , and is a prerequisite for dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instability has been credited as the primary mechanism for vortex nucleation in the rotating trap experiments @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that while the dynamic instability helps induce vortex nucleation , the actual penetration of vortices in to the bulk is a consequence of the energetic instability @xcite .",
    "the excitation spectra studied in this paper , both analytically and numerically do not exhibit any dynamic instabilities in that we do not observe a critical effective magnetic field at which the excitation energy becomes complex . due to the increased complexity of adding an inhomogeneous effective magnetic field , however , we have restricted ourselves to consider trapping configurations which are radially symmetric . for the homogeneous effective magnetic field",
    "dynamical instabilities are only observed with the introduction of an anisotropic trap @xcite , and this is likely to be the case for inhomogeneous magnetic fields as well .",
    "energetic instabilities , by contrast , occur readily .",
    "for all the vector potentials considered in section iv the numerical results display energetic instabilities beyond a critical field strength proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "as we increase the radial exponent @xmath91 in the vector potential we in turn must significantly increase the probe beam angular momentum before the instability can be observed .",
    "when the full effective trapping potential is included the @xmath111 case exhibits an energetic instability but in the vast majority of parameter space those for @xmath158 do not . only in the region",
    "where the maximum intensity ratio @xmath35 approaches 1 do we observe instabilities in the low - energy modes .",
    "however , it is in this region the adiabatic dynamics most easily breaks down @xcite and the model described in section ii may become invalid .",
    "another important feature of the spectra calculated in sections iv and v is the accidental degeneracies , which occur where the mode frequencies intersect in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "these degeneracies are likely to be manifested through transfer of excitations from higher order modes to lower order modes at the point of degeneracy .",
    "this kind of phenomenon could have implications for the condensate evolution depending on whether the effective magnetic field is switched on instantly or its strength is adiabatically ramped up to a final value .",
    "for example , an anisotropically trapped condensate in a homogeneous effective magnetic field naturally undergoes @xmath159 quadrupole oscillations , but the higher order modes exhibit dynamic instability @xcite , eventually leading to vortex nucleation . to properly account for the mode - coupling we would need to move beyond bogoliubov - de gennes theory which does not account for interactions between the degenerate modes @xcite .    with inclusion of the full effective trap induced by the interaction with the light",
    "we reach a scenario where there are no accidental degeneracies as @xmath91 is increased beyond 1 .",
    "the vector potential appearing in the bogoliubov - de gennes equations is less important in determining the excitation frequencies in comparison with the effective trap .",
    "a direct measure of the contribution of the vector potential is the splitting of the + and - @xmath102 modes . for the potentials with @xmath160 studied in section v",
    ", we find that the splitting is typically @xmath161 of the actual mode frequency if no effective magnetic field were present .",
    "this is in stark contrast to section iv where the splitting can easily exceed twice the mode frequency causing an energetic instability for realistic parameter values .    in this paper",
    "we have deliberately paid particular attention to the surface modes ( @xmath137 , @xmath162 ) , which are naturally excited by adding the effective magnetic field to an anisotropically trapped condensate @xcite .",
    "we predict that for inhomogeneous effective magnetic fields vortex nucleation will be inhibited due to the dominance of the trapping potential induced by the light . in general",
    ", it is the ratio of the cyclotron frequency to the effective trapping frequency which drives the dynamics of the system and both of these depend on @xmath157 .",
    "it is therefore often desirable to introduce a counter potential to act against the additional trapping terms due to the interaction with the light , as described in section iv .",
