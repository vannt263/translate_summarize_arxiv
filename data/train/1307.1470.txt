    "the most direct way to test the above theoretical picture is direct detection of the progenitor .",

    ". we also present early photometric , spectroscopic and wide - band radio observations and discuss implications on the progenitor .",
    "on 2013 jun 16.238 ut , the automated real - time discovery and classification pipeline of the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ; * ? ? ? * nugent et al . in prep ) identified a new transient source with @xmath18=18.6mag in the vicinity of ngc5806 ( see figure [ fig : discovery ] , @xcite ) .",
    "no source was detected at the same location to @xmath19mag ( 3@xmath0 ) on jun 15.240 ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "also , there was no evidence for pre - outburst activity in 492 ptf images taken since 2009 jun 29 to a similar depth .",
    "our duty astronomer saved this source as iptf13bvn and initiated rapid , multi - wavelength follow - up .",
    "on jun 20.276 , we observed iptf13bvn in @xmath20-band with osiris @xcite and the laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs - ao ) system @xcite mounted on the 10 m keck telescope . registering the ao image to the archival",

    ". the luminosity and colors are consistent with the compilation of wn and wc wolf rayet stars in @xcite .    however , wr stars are often in binaries @xcite .",
    "thus , the progenitor is possibly in a binary system and the light is dominated by the companion .",
    "we further note that color alone can not be used as a discriminant .",
    "the b , v and i filters are in the rayleigh - jeans tail of hot stars , including o - stars , wr stars and blue supergiants .",
    "moreover , given the @xmath31 pixel size of _",
    "hst_/acs , or equivalently 5.45pc at the distance of ngc5806 , the candidate can also be an unresolved young star cluster whose color is dominated by ob stars .",

    "as part of regular iptf operations , the field of iptf13bvn was imaged twice a night every night by the palomar 48-inch oschin telescope ( p48 ) with a mould @xmath32-band filter @xcite during the spring quarter . upon discovery of iptf13bvn , the robotic palomar 60-inch telescope ( p60 ; * ? ? ?",

    "in the p48 , p60 and _ swift _ images , the host background is subtracted by using pre - explosion reference images , while in the lcogt images a low - order polynomial fit is used to remove the background .",

    "photometry in @xmath38-bands is calibrated to sdss stars and that in @xmath39-bands is calibrated with landolt standard stars .",
    "the multi - color light curve of iptf13bvn is illustrated in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopic follow - up of iptf13bvn was undertaken with the dolores low - resolution spectrograph on telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , the marcario low - resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; @xcite ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , the low - resolution , cross - dispersed spectrograph floyds ( sand et al . in prep ) on the robotic faulkes telescope ( ft ) , the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the arc 3.5-m telescope , the folded - port infrared echellete ( fire , * ? ? ?",

    "the energetic type ic supernova ptf12gzk rises much faster than iptf13bvn .",
    "surprisingly , the closest match to the rise rate of iptf13bvn through 8days is the high velocity type ic ptf10vgv ( albeit about two magnitudes fainter ) .",
    "following @xcite , we derive a constraint on the progenitor radius based on our detection limits on shock cooling .",
    "the inferred radius is sensitive to the `` mean '' velocity of the ejecta @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the explosion energy and @xmath52 is the mass of the ejecta .",
    "based on the measured photospheric velocities and line velocities (  [ sec : spec ] ) , we conservatively adopt the lowest velocity of 8000kms@xmath9 .",
    "if the velocity was higher , the radius of the progenitor would be constrained to be even smaller @xcite .",
    "the model also depends weakly on @xmath51 and thus we assume @xmath53erg . in the right bottom panel of figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , the predicted @xmath18-band light curves ( gray lines ) of shock cooling with various explosion times are also plotted .",
    "we find : if the explosion had happened earlier than t@xmath54 , the progenitor radius would have to be unreasonably small ( @xmath55 ) because the luminosity of the shock breakout is tightly constrained by non - detection on jun 14 .",
    "if the explosion happened at t@xmath54 , the progenitor radius @xmath56 .",
    "if the explosion happened at t@xmath54 + 0.5day , the progenitor radius @xmath57 .",
    "we conclude that the progenitor radius was no larger than a few solar radii , suggesting a stripped core such as wr stars .",
    "the strongest features in the early spectra are the ca h@xmath58k and ca near - ir triplet absorption .",
    "the blends of fe lines at @xmath59  and fe , mg and ti at @xmath60  are also prominent .",
    "the local minimum at about @xmath61  may be either he or na and that at about @xmath62  may be interpreted as either si or ne . at + 2.6days after explosion , a synow fit gives a photospheric velocity of 10000kms@xmath9 and a ca ii line velocity of 14000kms@xmath9 . by + 11.5days",
    ", these velocities evolve to 8000 and 10000kms@xmath9 respectively .",
    "helium lines are not expected to be prominent in early spectra of type ib supernovae @xcite .",
    "we begin to see weak wiggles at the location of he i ( 5876 6678  and 7065 ) in optical spectra after + 10days .",
    "however , synow can not fit a single expansion velocity to all the three lines simultaneously . in the ir spectra",
    ", we see a prominent 10200  absorption feature , which may be explained by he 10830 line blended with metal lines .",
    "the 20581   doublet is often used to confirm the presence of he @xcite . by + 16.7days",
    ", we unambiguously detect this feature ( see the inset of figure  [ fig : spec_seq ] ) .",
    "therefore , we classify iptf13bvn as a type b supernova @xcite .",
    "promptly after discovery , we initiated radio follow - up observations at the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) and requested director s discretionary time at the jansky very large array ( jvla ) .",
    "our jvla and carma data showed that the radio counterpart had a synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) spectrum . on being denied our request for additional jvla observations , our colleagues were able to initiate australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations .",

    "the carma data were reduced using miriad @xcite with j@xmath64 as a phase calibrator and mwc349 as a flux calibrator .",
    "the atca data were reduced using miriad with pksb1921 - 293 as a bandpass calibrator , pksb1508 - 055 as a phase calibrator and pksb1934 - 638 as a flux calibrator .",
    "all the radio data is presented in figure  [ fig : radio ] .",
    "we fit the multi - frequency multi - epoch data to the ssa model following @xcite .",
    "we assume that the electron energy distribution can be described by a power law @xmath65 .",
    "the fitted models are also presented in figure  [ fig : radio ] .",
    "we note that the ssa model alone is consistent with all our data including the null - detection in c band on jun 18 .",
    "however , on jun 19.1 , @xcite observed iptf13bvn with the jvla in c band and announced a null - detection with an rms of @xmath66jy .",
    "based on our ssa model , we estimate that kamble & soderberg should have detected iptf13bvn at a level of @xmath67 .",
    "their null detection therefore may require additional free - free absorption at low frequencies .",
    "based on inverse compton scattering , we estimate the x - ray emission to be @xmath68 .",
    "this is consistent with our _ swift_/xrt upper limit of @xmath69 on jun 17 ( assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index of 2.0 ) .",
    "we note that @xcite reported an x - ray detection by co - adding the xrt data from jun 17 to jul 13 .",
    "we reprocessed the xrt data from the first ten days after the supernova explosion and resulted in a 3-@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath70 .",
    "this is also consistent with our expectation from inverse compton scattering .",
    "we find that the radio emission peaks at @xmath71ghz with fluxes of @xmath72mjy on jun 18 , 21 and 24 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we derive a shockwave radius @xmath73 and a magnetic field strength @xmath74 . using the explosion date determined in the optical data ,",
    "we find a shock wave velocity of @xmath75 , which is typical for sneb / c @xcite .",

    "iptf13bvn is a type b supernova that exploded on jun 15.67 and rose to maximum luminosity of m@xmath7916.6 in about 18days .",
    "the luminosity of the supernova in the first ten days is approximately proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "we identify a single progenitor candidate within a 2@xmath0 error radius of 8.7pc in pre - explosion _ hst _ imaging .",
