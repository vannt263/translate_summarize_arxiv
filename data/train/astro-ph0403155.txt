    "one of the major legacies of the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ was to establish the ubiquity of uv line - profile variability in ob stars .",
    "the pattern of variability predominantly consists of extra absorption features ( the so - called discrete absorption components ; hereafter dacs ) moving blueward across the ( unsaturated ) absorption troughs of p cygni lines ( e.g. , kaper 1996 ) . the repetitive nature of dacs and the fact that the recurrence time - scale is commensurate with the ( otherwise ill - defined ) stellar rotational period suggest that rotation plays a key role in inducing the patterns of variability ( e.g. , kaper 1999 ) .",
    "uv time - series with a long temporal baseline ( i.e. , sampling several rotational periods ) have revealed that ob stars exhibit a great diversity of behaviours that can not always be strictly related to the stellar rotation period ( e.g. , howarth , prinja & massa 1995 ; prinja , massa & fullerton 1995 ; prinja , massa & fullerton 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this global phenomenon has been successfully interpreted in several cases in the framework of a model in which the changes are caused by the rotational modulation of large - scale , azimuthally - extended wind streams ( e.g. , fullerton 1997 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations of cranmer & owocki ( 1996 ) suggest that large - scale photospheric perturbations ( e.g. , bright spots causing a local enhancement of the radiative driving force ) may lead to the development of these structures .",
    "although the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive , pulsational instability can be invoked as a trigger of the wind variability ( e.g. , fullerton , gies & bolton 1996 ) .",
    "large - scale or surface magnetic field structures could be a viable alternative in view of the growing evidence for ( weak ) magnetic fields in ob stars ( e.g. , henrichs , neiner & geers 2003 ) .",
    "photospheric perturbations arising from these two phenomena are likely to have a significant impact on the global wind morphology ( e.g. , ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) .    with the demise of _ iue _ ,",
    "further progress on this issue is likely to stem in the foreseeable future from time - resolved studies of line variability in the optical .",
    "firstly , intensive uv observations have been carried out over several rotation periods for few stars ( massa 1995 ; prinja 1998 ; de jong 2001 ) . for practical reasons ,",
    "an optical survey is much more amenable at collecting high - quality observations covering several cycles for a large , representative sample of ob stars .",
    "secondly , in contrast to the uv resonance lines , optical recombination lines are ( at least partly ) formed in ob supergiants in the dense , strongly accelerating part of the outflow close to the stellar core . in virtue of their density - squared dependence",
    ", they are good probes of the large density gradients expected to prevail in the co - rotating interaction regions ( cranmer & owocki 1996 ) . revealing a cyclical pattern of variability in these lines would give further credence to the idea that the origin of anisotropic outflows in ob stars is deep - seated and causally linked to processes taking place at the stellar photosphere . here",
    "we discuss the temporal behaviour of , which is typically formed at @xmath0@xmath1 1.5 @xmath2 in o - type stars ( e.g. , prinja , fullerton & crowther 1996 ) .",
    "although the line - formation region is likely to be more extended in b - type supergiants , this transition still probes the few inner radii of the stellar wind .",
    "previous surveys have been very useful in documenting line - profile variability in ob stars ( e.g. , ebbets 1982 ) , but frequently suffered from a poor temporal sampling hampering the study of the line - profile variations on a rotational time - scale ( up to several weeks in the case of b supergiants ) . despite the persistent and numerous searches for optical line - profile variability in ob stars , evidence for rotational modulation has been found in only few cases ( e.g. , moffat & michaud 1981 ; kaper 1997 , 1998 ) . in the uv and optical domains the time - scales associated with",
    "the changes are often identical , within the uncertainties ( e.g. , howarth 1995 ; kaper 1999 ; de jong 2001 ; kaufer , prinja & stahl 2002 ) .",
    "this suggests that variability and dacs diagnose the same underlying physical phenomenon .",
    "the long - term monitoring of the line presented in this paper aims at better establishing the incidence of rotationaly modulated variability in ob supergiants .",
    "to potentially link the photospheric and wind activity , coordinated broad - band photometic observations were also carried out for a subset of this sample .",
    "our survey primarily targets early b - type stars and can thus be regarded as complementary to others that concentrate on o - type ( kaper 1998 ; kaper 1998 ) or late b- to early a - type supergiants ( kaufer 1996 ) .",
    "the results presented in the following supersede previous preliminary reports ( morel 2004a , b ) .",
    "our targets are drawn from a magnitude - limited ( @xmath3@xmath47.5 ) sample of early - type supergiants ( o7.5b9 ) with evidence for an emission - like profile or , in the case of stars with an absorption feature , for previous claims of a wind - related variability ( e.g. , filling - in of the profile ) .",
    "known close binaries were discarded from this list in order to avoid contamination from the wind collision effects ( e.g. , thaller 2001 ) .",
    "the wide binary orbit of hd 37742 rules out the formation of a bow shock created from the interaction with an o - type companion ( hummel 2000 ) . in our data only hd 13854 and hd 47240 present significant velocity variations of the photospheric hei @xmath56678.15 line which might be attributed to binary motion ( see below ) .",
    "dwarfs and giant stars were not included in this list , as is of photospheric origin in the vast majority of these objects .",
    "the only exception was the o7.5 giant hd 24912 ( @xmath6 per ) because of previous claims of a cyclical , wind - related pattern of variability in ( kaper 1997 ; de jong 2001 ) .",
    "for the other stars in our list , no clear evidence for cyclical line - profile variations in optical wind lines was found prior to our survey .",

    "+ @xmath8 these stars do not exhibit significant variability in ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we performed a period search analysis by calculating the power spectra ( hereafter ps ) using the technique of scargle ( 1982 ) on : ( a ) the photometric _ hipparcos _ data ( our observations are not amenable to a period search ) , ( b ) the pixel - to - pixel time - series , ( c ) the equivalent widths ( ews ) measured within fixed wavelength intervals encompassing the whole of ( _ even _ in the case of p cygni profiles ) . despite the fact that the ew and pixel - to - pixel line - profile variations are not , strictly speaking , two independent quantities , a period search in the two data sets helps assessing the reality of the detected signals .",
    "subsequent correction of the frequency spectrum by the clean algorithm was performed in order to remove aliases and spurious features induced by the uneven spacing of the data in the time domain ( roberts , lehr & dreher 1987 ) .",
    "periodicities in the range 127 days have been found for 9 stars in our sample .",
    "several stars display significant variability at the 0.030.07 mag level without , however , evidence for cyclical changes . a complex , multi - periodic behaviour can not be ruled out in this case . as can be seen in fig.2 , our photometric observations of hd 13854 , hd 14134 , hd 14818 , and hd 47240 support the periodic nature of the variations suggested by the _ hipparcos _ data .",
    "this demonstrates the remarkable long - term ( years ) coherency in the patterns of variability : folded with the appropriate periods , practically all the new data points stay well within the scatter limits ( mainly intrinsic , considering the typical accuracy of the _ hipparcos _ photometry ) , _ without _ any adjustment of the initially chosen zero phases .",
    "the significance of the peaks in the ps can be , in principle , rigourously estimated after normalization by the variance of the data ( e.g. , scargle 1982 ) . in the case of unevenly spaced time - series , however , the false alarm probability ( hereafter fap ) is only indicative and can not be used as a robust indicator of the presence of periodic signals in the data ( see , e.g. , antokhin 1995 ) .",
    "while assessing the reality of the periods found in our spectroscopic data set , we therefore took into account additional criteria .",
    "namely , we inspected the period - folded ew / line - profile data , and compared the ew and 2d pixel - to - pixel ps ( even though the line - profile variations are obviously not necessarily accompanied by significant ew changes ) .",

    "it is therefore unlikely that spectral changes operating on such a long time - scale would be associated to rotation .",
    "variations intrinsic to a circumstellar disc - like enhancement can not be ruled out a priori , but they would manifest themselves as v / r variations of the line emission peaks , which are not observed ( fig.4 ) . +",
    "the results of our period search are summarized in table 2 .",
    "several of the listed periods must be regarded as tentative , especially those detected either in the 2d or in the ew ps .",
    "independent confirmation is clearly needed in this case .",
    "we also recall that hd 13854 and hd 47240 might be part of a close , massive binary system ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "since our survey was not designed to detect short - term periodicities , the found periods close to one day must also be regarded with some caution .",
    "they might arise from rotational modulation only for the fastest rotators .",
    "conversely , they might be associated with the pseudo - periodic ejection of puffs of material .",
    "such an outward propagation of density perturbations has been proposed to account for the recurrent changes ( with a time - scale of @xmath120 days ) in the line of the b0.5 hypergiant hd 152236 ( rivinius 1997 ) .",
    "changes on a time - scale of about one day might be compatible with the characteristic flow time through the line - formation region in our program stars , provided that these putative , spatially - localized density enhancements follow a @xmath26-type velocity law with an exponent close to unity .",
    "although such an interpretation can not be completely ruled out , it should be noted that hd 152236 is considered as a candidate luminous blue variable and is likely not representative of the stars in our sample ( sterken 1997 ) .",
    "pulsations can also operate on a 1-d time - scale , but we find no trivial relation between the spectroscopic and photometric periods ( the latter presumably related to pulsations , as argued below ) .",
    "summarising , we consider that the two stars with a relatively long - term periodic modulation seen both in the ew and in the line - profile data sets present the strongest cases for a cyclical behaviour : hd 14134 and hd 42087 ( with @xmath14@xmath112.8 and 25.0 d , respectively ) .",
    "the phase - related patterns of variability are remarkably similar ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "in addition , the line - profile changes in and also seem to be correlated in both stars , with excess emission in being accompanied by a weakening of . as can be seen in fig.5",
    ", this may also apply to weak metal lines such as cii @xmath56578.05 and cii @xmath56582.88 ( note that variations in the continuum level may be invoked in the case of hd 14134 in view of the large , phase - locked photometric variations ) .",
    "since a significant amount of incipient wind emission is not expected for stars with such relatively low mass - loss rates ( table 1 ) , this phenomenon may point to a link between the wind variability and photospheric disturbances .",
    "higher resolution data are , however , needed to reveal an organized pattern of variability in photospheric lines , as observed in other b - type supergiants ( kaufer 1997 , 2002 ) .",
    "the lack of cyclical variations for several stars in our sample can have a physical origin or may be ascribed to the limitations of the current data set ( e.g. , insufficient time sampling ) . concerning the latter point , it is suggestive that the stars with a detected period in are among those displaying the highest level of variability .",
    "the large amplitude of the variations exhibited by most stars suggests that an imperfect removal of telluric features or s / n issues are probably irrelevant .",
    "one may be more concerned by the fact that our observations were relatively few and spread out over several months .",
    "if we accept the idea that large - scale wind streams give rise to the variability , substantial variations in the global wind morphology might be expected on a time - scale of months / years ( as in the case of the b0.5 ib star hd 64760 ; fullerton 1997 ) .",
    "a lack of coherency in the pattern of variability on a monthly time - scale would thus not be surprising , especially for the fastest rotators in our sample .",
    "it is unlikely in this case that a strong periodic signal would appear in the data .",
    "another issue which may lead to a loss of periodic signal is the complex pattern of variability presented by in b supergiants ( see , e.g. , kaufer 1996 ; de jong 2001 ; prinja 2001 ) , emphasizing the need for high spectral / time resolution .",
    "detailed studies of the line - profile variations in the uv domain have inferred a rather simple geometrical structure for the wind of some b supergiants , with generally two ( or four ) symmetrical , spatially - extended wind streams ( e.g. , fullerton 1997 ) .",
    "consequently , one generally expects the recurrence time - scale of the line - profile variations to be an integer fraction of the stellar rotational period , rather than the period itself . in hd 24912 , for instance",
    ", the period found in can be identified , within the uncertainties , with one half of the rotation period ( de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the fact that the periodicity found in the spectroscopic data set for hd 42087 is longer than the estimated maximum rotational period is therefore puzzling in this respect ( table 2 ) .",
    "apart from rotation , however , there is a clear indication for the existence of an additional ( perhaps dominating ) line broadening mechanism in b - type supergiants ( plausibly tangential macroturbulence ; howarth 2004 ) .",
    "the projected rotational velocities are thus likely to be grossly overestimated for the stars in our sample , with the result that the true rotational periods may be significantly longer than anticipated ( ryans 2002 ) .",
    "the modulation time - scale of in hd 14134 and hd 42087 is commensurate with the probable rotation periods , but rotational modulation can not be firmly established in view of these uncertainties .",
    "for the former , the 12.8-d period found is close to the estimate of the minimum rotational period ( @xmath110 days ) , which would imply that this star is a fast rotator viewed almost equator - on .",
    "however , because in hd 14134 the @xmath27 is typical of stars of the same spectral type ( howarth 1997 ) , this 12.8-d time - scale is more likely to be an integer fraction of the rotation period .",
    "the prominent changes affecting the p cygni absorption component of the line in hd 14134 and hd 42087 ( fig.6 ) may diagnose variations in the amount of wind material seen projected against the stellar disk because of an azimuthal dependence of the mass - loss rate .",
    "note in this respect that in hd 14134 maximum emission and maximum light do not seem to exactly coincide ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the existence of such a phase offset ( which needs to be confirmed thanks to a more accurate ephemeris ) would be consistent with a picture in which photospheric perturbations lead to the development of large - scale , spiral - shaped wind structures ( cranmer & owocki 1996 ) . let us suppose a bright photospheric region causing a local enhancement of the mass - loss rate .",
    "one observes a classical p cygni profile when this ` overloaded ' portion of the wind is projected against the stellar disk .",
    "however , the motion of this wind feature towards the stellar limb because of rotation will cause the growth of emission . a small phase lag ( i.e. , @xmath28@xmath40.25 )",
    "would be expected if the spot has significant azimuthal extent .",
    "a substantial modulation of the local mass - loss rate may also be invoked to explain the large , phase - locked ews variations seen in other stars ( e.g. , hd 13854 ; fig.3 ) .",
    "the hypothesis that the development of azimuthally structured outflows in early - type stars is intimately linked to processes taking place at the photosphere ( cranmer & owocki 1996 ) has received considerable observational support ( e.g. , henrichs , kaper & nichols 1994 ; reid & howarth 1996 ) . much more controversial , however , is the nature of the seed perturbations , with pulsational and magnetic activity as the most straightforward candidates . in the light of our results ,",
    "we discuss below the relevance of these two scenarios in b - type supergiants .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ data have revealed the existence of a large population of b - type supergiants with daily , quasi - periodic light variations .",
    "these stars might constitute the extension to higher luminosities of the slowly pulsating b stars , suggesting the @xmath29-mechanism excitation of multiple , non - radial gravity modes arising from a metal opacity bump at @xmath30 @xmath1 2 @xmath20",
    "10@xmath31 k in stellar interiors ( e.g. , waelkens 1998 ) . both the amplitude and the time - scale of the photometric variations",
    "are compatible to what is observed in our sample . to investigate this issue in more detail , we plot in fig.7 our stars on a hr diagram , along with the theoretical instability strips for non - radial g modes calculated _ without _ mass loss and rotation ( pamyatnykh 1999 ) . the stars with a clear cyclical behaviour ( a sample evidently biased towards the stars with large photometric amplitudes ) do not appear to fall in the predicted domains of pulsational instability .",
    "the nlte spectral synthesis of kudritzki ( 1999 ) suggests systematically higher effective temperatures and luminosities for some stars included in our study .",
    "however , such a temperature offset may not be sufficient to bring these stars in the instability zone .",
    "furthermore , only the late b - type stars in our sample seem to follow the period - luminosity relation for g modes ( see fig.3 of waelkens 1998 ) .",
    "massive stars are also believed to experience a variety of strange - mode and resonance instabilities ( kiriakidis , fricke & glatzel 1993 ) , but there is no indication that the photometric variations are related to this phenomenon ( fig.7 ) .",
    "the ubiquity of pulsational instability in this part of the hr diagram ( e.g. , fullerton 1996 ; kaufer 1997 ) leads us to consider pulsations as most likely responsible for the photometric variations , although it is clear from the above discussion that the pulsation modes have yet to be identified in this case .",
    "the apparent dichotomy between the photometric properties of o and b supergiants seen in fig.7 ( the former exhibiting significantly lower variability amplitudes ) suggests that the pulsations are of different nature in these 2 class of objects ( e.g. , higher modes are excited in o - type stars ) .",
    "the complete absence of the photometric periods in the time - series ( hd 14134 excluded ) seems at first glance to argue against pulsations as driver of the wind variability ( once again under the assumption that the light variations can be ascribed to this mechanism ) .",
    "as can be seen in fig.7 , the stars displaying the highest level of variability are not preferentially found close to the zones of pulsational instability .",
    "this hypothesis can be investigated further by looking for a correlation between the amplitude of the photometric and changes , as parametrized by the activity indices @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the latter calculated from _ hipparcos _",
    "data ; section 4 ) .",
    "although there is a hint of a positive correlation ( fap@xmath12.3 per cent ) , this trend disappears when the 4 stars displaying line - profile variations that can not be unambiguously related to wind activity , but can be of purely photospheric origin , are excluded ( i.e. , hd 21291 , hd 24398 , hd 31327 , and hd 119608 ) .",
    "in addition , there is also no correlation between @xmath32 ( ) and @xmath32 ( ) .",
    "the lack of a clear statistical relationship between the levels of activity at the photosphere and at the base of the outflow ( as diagnosed by the photometric changes / and , respectively ) suggests that the same physical mechanism ( i.e. , presumably pulsations ) is not responsible for the photospheric and wind activity .",
    "this conclusion relies , however , on statistical grounds and should be in principle examined on a star - to - star basis : here we note the example of hd 64760 , where the same periodic signal seems to appear in photospheric and wind lines ( kaufer 2002 ) .",
    "although detailed models are still lacking , one may also expect a complex interplay between any pulsation signal and wind changes ( e.g. , beating of some pulsation modes ) .",
    "this is likely to result in a loose ( if any ) relationship between photometric and changes , for instance .",
    "a growing amount of evidence suggests the existence of weak magnetic fields in early - type stars , although firm detections are still scarce and might be restricted to some atypical cases .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of the very young o46 star @xmath34@xmath35 orionis c have revealed a relatively strong magnetic field , 1.1@xmath180.1 kg ( donati 2002 ) .",
    "the existence of a weaker field in the b1 iv star @xmath26 cephei ( with a polar component of 360@xmath1830 g ) has also been reported recently .",
    "this field appears to be sufficient to control the outflow at large distances from the star ( out to @xmath19@xmath2 ; donati 2001 ) .",
    "magnetic activity in ob stars is also hinted at by x - ray observations of the o9.5 ii star hd 36486 ( @xmath36 ori ) and hd 37742 ( waldron & cassinelli 2000 ; miller 2002 ) which challenge the generally accepted view that the x - ray emission in early - type stars solely arises from outwardly propagating shocks developing as the result of the inherently unstable nature of radiation - driven winds ( see also feigelson 2002 ) .",
    "recent theoretical studies indicate that a magnetic field of a moderate strength can be produced via dynamo action at the interface between the convective core and the outer radiative envelope , and brought up to the surface on a time - scale typically smaller than the main - sequence lifetime ( charbonneau & macgregor 2001 ; macgregor & cassinelli 2003 ) .",
    "apart from our observations of hd 14134 ( section 5.2 ) , hd 24912 is the only star in our sample for which a magnetic field has been searched for via spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "a 3-@xmath37 upper limit of 210 g in the longitudinal component was derived ( de jong 2001 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this does not set stringent constraints on the potential role played by magnetic activity , as even relatively weak fields ( @xmath38@xmath15100 g ) are suspected to significantly perturb line - driven flows ( owocki 1994 ) .",
    "this issue has been recently worked out in more detail by ud - doula & owocki ( 2002 ) who studied the influence of a large - scale magnetic field with a dipole configuration on the radiatively - driven outflow of an early - type star .",
    "they found that the disturbance imposed by the magnetic forces can be parametrized by a confinement parameter , @xmath39=@xmath40@xmath41/@xmath42@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the equatorial field strength at the stellar surface .",
    "the magnetic field appears to significantly impact on the wind morphology and dynamics even for values as low as @xmath39=0.1 , while the emergent flow is channeled along closed magnetic loops for @xmath39@xmath451 . for the physical parameters typical of our program stars ( e.g. , hd 14134 ; see table 1 ) , we obtain @xmath39=1 for @xmath44@xmath170 g. in this case the alfvn radius would be about 2 @xmath2 , i.e. , comparable to the extent of the line - formation region ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) . this rough estimate shows that magnetic activity can not be ruled out as driver of the wind activity at this stage .",
    "a much stronger field is unlikely in hd 14134 , considering our spectropolarimetric observations together with the lack of strong x - ray emission ( @xmath46[0.24.0 kev ] @xmath15 33.0 ergs s@xmath10 ; grillo 1992 ) .",
    "fields of the same magnitude can also be expected in other stars from our sample in view of their relatively low x - ray luminosities ( berghfer , schmitt & cassinelli 1996 ) .",
    "our long - term monitoring has confirmed the ubiquity of line - profile variations in ob supergiants .",
    "the changes result from the combined effect of a varying amount of incipient wind emission and an intrinsically variable underlying photospheric profile , with the relative contribution of these two phenomena varying from one star to another . as a consequence of the large amplitude of the variations observed",
    ", a precise determination of the stellar atmospheric parameters will not be generally possible from profile fitting of the balmer lines in snapshot spectra .",
    "taken at face value , for instance , the ew variations shown in fig.3 would translate in the most extreme cases into a @xmath180.8 dex uncertainty in the derived mass - loss rate ( puls 1996 ; equation [ 43 ] ) .",
    "although it remains to be seen whether a sophisticated modelling would result in drastically different figures , the large changes intrinsic to the early - type supergiants may be one of the most important factors limiting the accuracy with which these objects can be used as extragalactic distance indicators ( see discussion in kudritzki 1999 ) .",
    "this survey has revealed the existence of cyclical line - profile variations in hd 14134 and hd 42087 .",
    "the low detection rate ( 2 cases out of 17 ) may have several explanations , including observational limitations or a loss of coherency in the patterns of variability .",
    "hd 14134 is of particular interest , as it is one of the very few early - type stars clearly exhibiting the same pattern of variability in the photometric and spectroscopic modes .",
    "the existence of azimuthally structured outflows in our program stars might explain the dramatic changes , but firm conclusions must await detailed modelling ( see harries 2000 for the first effort in this direction ) .",
    "sensitive searches for close companions ( e.g. , via long - baseline optical interferometric observations ) are also needed to firmly rule out a variability arising from wind interaction .",
    "we do not find evidence for a direct coupling between the wind activity and base perturbations arising from pulsations , but we caution that our data are not well suited to examine this aspect in detail .",
    "it is conceivable that in several instances the globally anisotropic nature of the outflow primarily results from the putative existence of small - scale magnetic loops anchored at the stellar photosphere ( or alternatively a presumably fossil , large - scale dipole field ) .",
    "a major observational effort is currently undertaken to detect such weak magnetic fields in early - type stars ( e.g. , henrichs 2003 ) .",
    "firm detections can be expected in the forseeable future .",
    "they would place the above conclusions on a quantitative footing and directly address the relevance of this scenario .",
    "we are indebted to g. a. wade and the tbl - musicos team for obtaining a single circular polarization spectrum of hd 14134 during the mission precision studies of stellar magnetism across the hr diagram ( july 2003 ) .",
    "this work greatly benefited from the comments of the anonymous referee .",
