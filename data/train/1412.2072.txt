    "a recent , analytic formulation of non - perturbative , gauge - invariant , realistic qcd @xcite used elementary functional techniques to sum all gluon exchanges between any pair of quark and/or antiquark lines , including cubic and quartic gluon interactions , yielding a realistic quark - binding potential not approximated by static quarks , as well as ( to our knowledge ) the first example of nucleon - binding directly from qcd .",
    "the result is that individual gluon exchanges disappear from the theory , within their infinite sums each replaced by a _ gluon bundle _ ( gb ) . what remains to be calculated , for any qcd correlation functions , is then the attachment of such gbs to quarks and to all possible combinations of closed - quark - loops ( cqls ) , as well as the definition of a procedure of quark / hadron renormalization .",
    "it is wise at this point to remember ( or at least paraphrase ) schwinger s remark defining renormalization as the change , or more properly a return , from the field picture back to the particle picture. in abelian qed , for example , where the sum of all radiative corrections defines a dressed photon or lepton propagator , with its @xmath0 or @xmath1 factor multiplying the mass - shell pole of that propagator , renormalization is simply defined as the division by , and effective removal of those @xmath2 and @xmath3 factors .",
    "but in non - abelian , gauge - invariant qcd , where the initial gluon fields and propagators disappear from the final analysis , what shall be the physically correct prescription of renormalization ? in this paper we formulate one such definition , in which simplicity and finiteness both play a major role .",
    "we make no claim to the uniqueness of our definition of renormalization , but only that it is a very simple and obvious way of performing both quark and coupling constant renormalization , in which every step of the program is finite .    for ease of presentation and clarity , we here make two simplifying approximations , which can easily be corrected and extended , as desired .",
    "the cql with but two gbs attached is written in terms of the well - known , un - renormalized , qed lepton loop , with color factors appropriated to qcd appended ; in this way , the intrinsic spin dependence of the quark and anti - quark which form the cql have been included , while there remains to be calculated an extra spin dependence peculiar to qcd .",
    "in addition , the transverse arguments @xmath4 of each @xmath5^{-1}$ ] , representing the connection of each loop to its pair of gbs , will be approximated by the averaged @xmath6 coordinate appropriate to that loop .",
    "as shown in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite , this makes no change in the single - loop amplitude ; and a similar statement can be obtained for the chain - loop calculation of this paper .    in order to keep this paper one of finite size , we urge all interested readers to first familiarize themselves with the material of refs .",

    "@xcite explains our method of achieving manifest gauge - invariance , and ends with a non - perturbative description of asymptotic freedom .",
    "it also contains what we believe to be the first exact statement of effective locality ( el ) , in which the two endpoint space - time coordinates of every gb are shown to be the same , which property provides tremendous computational simplicity , reducing a basic functional integral ( fi ) to a set of ordinary integrals  @xcite .    ref .",
    "@xcite employs the same functional techniques to display the small absurdities which appear in the amplitudes of all non - perturbative qcd processes  for example , the exchange of a gb between two quarks  because use of the standard qcd lagrangian makes no provision for the experimental fact that asymptotic quarks are always found in bound states ; and hence that , in principle , their transverse coordinates can never be measured nor specified precisely . to avoid such difficulty , a transverse imprecision integration over an unknown , transverse probability amplitude , @xmath7    where @xmath8 with @xmath9 real and symmetric under the interchange of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is introduced into the quark - gluon part of the lagrangian , which has the immediate effect of removing all such absurdities .",
    "the theory described by this extended lagrangian is what we have called realistic qcd.    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a particularly simple choice of the corresponding transverse probability amplitude @xmath12 is inserted into the standard qcd lagrangian , along with a simple and physically correct method of identifying that effective potential which generates the easily - calculated , non - perturbative eikonal function that would give the desired quark scattering and/or binding ; and our result is the potential of form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scale parameter for quark binding , on the order of the pion mass , and @xmath15 is a small , real , positive parameter of order @xmath16 . by inspection , there are here two parameters essential for quark binding , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , rather than just @xmath14 alone .    ref .",
    "@xcite carries the analysis one step further , and provides what we believe to be the first example of nuclear physics binding directly from qcd , using our eikonal method to obtain the effective potential which easily binds two nucleons  two triads of bound quarks  into a model deuteron . in eikonal and",

    "however , @xmath110 has a dimension of length or time , and appropriate care must be taken in assigning it a numerical value . since we expect the most significant contribution to any such high - energy scattering process to appear when the cm quark space - time indices are either 4 or 3 , corresponding to energy or to a related longitudinal momentum , we might well permit quantum mechanics ( qm ) to make the choice for us , replacing @xmath110 by a factor proportional to @xmath112 .",

    "@xcite , are there really divergences in qed , or is the appearance of such terms tied to the method of approximation ?    that question has recently been partially answered in ref .",
    "@xcite by the application of a method of functional summation  not just over a handful of feynman graphs , but over infinite numbers of interactions , in each member of an infinite class , each containing an infinite number of feynman graphs  which strongly suggests that charge renormalization in qed is indeed finite .",
    "that analysis has not yet been extended to leptonic mass renormalization , nor to wave - function and vertex renormalization ; but since the latter two quantities are equal and gauge - dependent , and always cancel in any physical measurement , one can accept their presence as an _",

    "therefore , if gauge - independent charge renormalization is finite , one can accept qed not as an approximate theory , containing a still - hidden sub - structure , but rather as a true theory of nature .",

    "it is possible to define single - particle , asymptotic field operators whose quanta are described in terms of coordinates which can , in principle , be specified exactly , just as in qed .",
    "but we have known for several decades that quarks and antiquarks are always asymptotically bound to each other , and therefore that their transverse momenta and/or position coordinates can only , in principle , be described with quantum - mechanical precision , rather than specified exactly .    when the functional techniques referred to in the above sections",
    "are applied to qcd , using a special rearrangement which guarantees manifest gauge invariance in ref .",

    "@xcite , all such absurdities vanish , and one can see the essential difference of non - perturbative summations of a non - abelian theory containing confinement , as compared to summations over one which violates that basic quantum - mechanical principle .    there is another difficulty with perturbative approximations in qcd , but one which could not have been known until summations over infinite numbers of gluons were functionally obtained .",
    "this is tied to the fact that the coupling constant @xmath232 appears in two different places in the lagrangian , once as the coupling of quarks to gluons , and again in that part of the interaction coupling of gluons to each other . for definiteness",
    ", we shall refer to the first coupling as @xmath234 , and to the second as @xmath235 ; they are , of course , to be set equal to each other , but it will be instructive to keep the distinction for a few more lines .",
    "the summation of all gluon exchanges between any two quark lines leads to amplitudes depending upon factors of @xmath236 ; and at this stage one can see the difficulties which arise when attempting perturbative expansions in @xmath232 , that is , at this stage in @xmath234 and @xmath235 , for one can not expand a function of @xmath237 about @xmath238 .",
    "such an expansion of both @xmath234 and @xmath235 corresponds to treating qcd as a mixture of qed and yang - mills , and all points in - between ; and leads to irrelevant divergences and confusion .",
    "this could not have been foreseen until the summations over all gluon exchanges were performed , but it illustrates the difficulties of a purely perturbative approach to qcd .",
    "finally , it may be useful to consider perturbative approximations of radiative corrections to particles which are themselves bound states of more fundamental objects , such as nucleons are of quarks , in mock - abelian theories , such as qed applied directly to protons .",
    "the simplest self - energy feynman graph of a proton emitting and re - absorbing a photon , illustrates the point : why is there a uv divergence associated with this graph ?",
    "the answer is simply because it has been tacitly assumed that the proton still exists , after emitting and then re - absorbing a virtual photon of sufficiently high energy , which produced the uv divergence .",
    "alternatively , consider the absorptive part of that amplitude , corresponding to the absorption of a photon by the struck proton , and the emission of the final photon by the proton .",
    "if the initial photon energy is far less than the binding energy of that three - quark proton state , then the feynman graph is perfectly relevant , and the contribution of the corresponding dispersion relation to the self - energy graph is finite .",
    "but when that photon s energy is far greater than the 3-quark binding energy , it will split the proton apart into its three fundamental quarks , which , according to the chain - model of this paper  will yield a perfectly finite amplitude , as will that of the re - combinations of each of those quarks into whichever asymptotic states they may form themselves .",
    "again , it is the tacit assumption that the proton is itself a fundamental particle which leads to the uv divergence ; and the removal of that and all other such uv divergences is simply to insert a cut - off statement , into the basic lagrangian , carrying the information that the lagrangian is only true when interacting photon energies are less than the proton s bound - state energy .",
