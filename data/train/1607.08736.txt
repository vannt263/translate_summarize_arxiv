    "it is a composite material that consists of particulate inclusion material stuck together by a cement matrix @xcite .",
    "a carefully selected choice of the inclusions serves to adjust the material properties to the current need .",
    "the amount of possible combinations appears vast .",
    "for instance , concrete reinforcement using vegetable fibers is discussed , motivated for instance by environmental reasons @xcite .",
    "the same principles of generating composite materials of new adjusted properties can of course be transferred to different classes of substances .",
    "for example , flexible polymer materials can be reinforced using carbon nanotubes @xcite . in a further step",
    ", inclusions may be added that can be selectively addressed by external fields to reversibly adjust the material properties during operation .",
    "examples are magnetic colloidal particles in a gel matrix , which allows to control the elastic properties by external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "our focus in this manuscript is mainly on elastic and viscoelastic ( quasi-)static and dynamic properties of such composite materials , ignoring at this time electric and magnetic field effects .",
    "yet , couplings to other variables are taken into account .",
    "for this purpose , we use and extend a macroscopic hydrodynamic approach that is based on symmetry arguments @xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", this hydrodynamic framework applies to macroscopic variables that do not relax in the spatially homogeneous limit .",
    "this is true for quantities characterized by local conservation laws , e.g.  mass , momentum , and energy @xcite , as well as for variables describing spontaneously broken continuous symmetries , such as the nematic director in nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , relaxation processes described by other variables and degrees of freedom may reach time scales comparable to the hydrodynamic one . then , they may influence or interfere with the macroscopic dynamics . in such situations",
    ", they should be included on a symmetry basis into the macroscopic description as so - called slowly relaxing variables @xcite .    in this study , we consider materials composed of more or less elastic or viscoelastic inclusions embedded in an elastic or viscoelastic matrix . at first glance , it seems a little contradictory that the dynamics of small embedded inclusions should reach the macroscopic time scales of the overall material . yet , for instance in polymeric materials , such situations are conceivable .",
    "for example , a matrix of permanently crosslinked polymer can respond in a relatively quick and elastic way @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , the relaxation of non - permanently crosslinked but strongly entangled polymer inclusions may reach macroscopic time scales @xcite .",
    "likewise , our theory should be applicable to describe dynamic aspects of different kinds of interpenetrating polymer networks @xcite .",
    "below , we will distinguish between three instances of ( visco)elastic strain deformation that we here refer to in the following way : the matrix , the inclusions , and a coupling zone between the two . an inspiration to include",
    "an additional coupling zone separately came from an experimental observation on magnetic elastomers , i.e.  rigid magnetic colloidal particles embedded in a crosslinked polymer matrix @xcite . from x - ray",
    "microtomographic investigations , it was concluded that the polymer in the close vicinity of the particles got significantly less crosslinked @xcite . also",
    "the opposite case of a stiffer immediate particle environment can be observed @xcite .",
    "such deviations from the bulk properties can be described by including coupling zones .",
    "coming back to our introductory example , coupling zones are likewise encountered in concrete . here , the cement matrix in the direct vicinity of the inclusions is observed to show a porosity different from its bulk value @xcite .",
    "other systems that explicitly show the structure referred to above are block copolymer melts and solutions in their microphase - separated states @xcite .",
    "linear triblock copolymers are made of linear polymer chains that exhibit three different blocks .",
    "these blocks can feature different chemical properties @xcite . under microphase separation ,",
    "blocks of identical chemical nature tend to gather and to avoid the other blocks",
    ". however , a macroscopic phase separation is not possible . on each chain ,",
    "the different blocks are linked to each other at their ends . from this frustration , regularly arranged domains of the dimension of the block size result . in fact , in a certain microphase - separated state , a continuous matrix can be formed by the blocks on one end of the linear chains .",
    "the blocks on the other end of the polymer chains can be regularly arranged within this matrix in the form of spherical inclusions .",
    "finally , the central blocks on the polymer chains can compose shells around these inclusions , coupling the inclusions to the matrix @xcite .",
    "due to different chemical properties of the different blocks , the three zones can feature different elastic and relaxation behaviors .",
    "these and further microphase - separated states @xcite , e.g.  regular lamellar phases , of these and other materials may likewise be covered by variants of our description .    in part , these are very specific systems . yet , our approach is based on symmetry arguments and can be transferred to any other material featuring similar prerequisites .",
    "if any of the three levels mentioned above does not play a role for the macroscopic system dynamics , e.g.  strain deformations of rigid inclusions , its influence can simply be discarded .",
    "thus , as a central point of our description , the different components do not have to deform in the same way , but may deform differently with respect to each other .",
    "this leads to _ relative strains _ between the different components .",
    "as we will demonstrate towards the end , the whole theory can be set up by initially using relative strains as macroscopic variables instead of different strains for different components . in this way ,",
    "relative strains are introduced as a new macroscopic variable .",
    "they complement two previous hydrodynamic concepts introduced in different contexts : on the one hand _",
    "relative translations _ , applied in the context of incommensurate smectic phases and chiral smectic polymers @xcite ; on the other hand _ relative rotations _ , introduced to characterize nematic and cholesteric liquid crystalline elastomers @xcite , the rheology of smectic liquid crystals @xcite , uniaxial magnetic gels @xcite , ferronematic and ferrocholesteric elastomers @xcite , and the behavior of active components in a gel - like environment @xcite .",
    "relative translations and rotations have their meaning also in the present context , so we will include them into our approach .",

    "first , in sec .  [ sec : variables ]",
    ", we introduce the set of variables that we use specifically to characterize the state of ( visco)elastic composite materials .",

    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , the dynamic equations are derived .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : relstrains ] ,",
    "we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic - like theory is in accord with introducing and systematically using relative strains as a new macroscopic variable . for illustration , we address some reduced minimum examples of applying the theory in sec .",

    ", we may introduce a macroscopic displacement field to characterize local displacements of the matrix , @xmath4 .",
    "however , the inclusions for some reason ( see , e.g. , the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) may be displaced in a different way , captured by a different field @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but both components are displaced in the same way , energetic contributions do not arise .",
    "in contrast to that , local differences between both displacements , i.e. , relative translations @xmath8 , typically cost energy .",
    "for instance , the matrix material around the inclusions is distorted when making place for relative translations of the inclusions .",
    "if relaxation processes of such relative translations are slow , it is justified to include them as macroscopic variables into our dynamic description .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath5 must be perceived as a local average over all inclusions within the volume element at position @xmath3 . in the following",
    ", the positional dependence will not be made explicit any more .",
    "a similar situation arises for _ relative rotations _ , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relrot ] .",
    "different from the rotations of the inclusions @xmath9 leads to relative rotations @xmath10 .",
    ", width=294 ]    rotations can be described by antisymmetric tensors that contain the information on the rotation axis and magnitude .",
    "we express local matrix rotations by an antisymmetric tensor @xmath11 and rotations of the inclusions by an antisymmetric tensor @xmath9 . here , the same reasoning as for relative translations arises . if the inclusions are rotated in a way different from their surrounding environment , relative rotations @xmath10 arise .",
    "if , for instance , matrix material is adsorbed on or linked to the inclusion surfaces , this leads to distortions of the matrix surrounding the inclusions and thus costs energy . again ,",
    "if corresponding relaxation processes are slow , relative rotations ought to be included as a macroscopic variable in a dynamic description .",
    "we remark an additional conceptual point .",
    "local rotations of the matrix can in principle be expressed by the local matrix displacement field , i.e.  @xmath12/2 $ ] , where the superscript @xmath13 marks the transpose .",
    "in contrast to that , @xmath9 can not in general be obtained from an according macroscopic displacement field .",
    "this is because each inclusion may rotate around its individual axis , instead of all inclusions within a volume element rotating together around a common axis in a rigid - body configuration .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 is obtained by averaging all rotation tensors for all inclusions within a local volume element of the material .",
    "finally , we come to the strain variables . here",
    ", a conceptual difference arises when compared to the two previous situations .",
    "( quasi-)static translations and rotations can only contribute to the energy of the system when different components are translated or rotated relatively to each other .",
    "this is not the case for strain deformations .",
    "straining one individual component by itself in general already costs energy .",
    "if the relaxation of the strain is slow enough , a corresponding macroscopic variable ought to be included into our dynamic description .    as motivated in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , we distinguish between three different zones within the materials , see fig .  [",

    ", width=170 ]    naturally , the inclusions ( @xmath15 ) are embedded in the surrounding matrix ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition to that , we resolve the effect of an explicit coupling zone ( @xmath14 ) connecting these two components .",
    "these coupling zones may be intentionally fabricated @xcite or they may arise during the manufacturing process if the matrix material on the inclusion surfaces behaves differently from the bulk of the matrix @xcite .    when straining the material , e.g.  when pulling on the matrix from outside , the different components may be strained in different ways ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : threezones_strained ] .    , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in a strained state .",
    "as depicted here , the three zones may deform in different ways .",
    "however , the deformation of each zone by itself already costs energy .",
    "therefore , three strain variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are introduced . , width=238 ]    this is most conceivable when we think of rigid inclusions that remain basically unstrained and then pull on the matrix from outside .",
    "then the coupling zone must deform in yet another way to accommodate the presence of the non - deformable inclusions within the macroscopically deformed matrix . from this consideration",
    ", it also becomes clear that the coupling zones do not necessarily need to consist of a different kind of material .",
    "instead , they can equally well serve as a simple concept to include strain inhomogeneities on the mesoscopic level into the overall macroscopic description , if necessary .    as a consequence ,",
    "we include three separate symmetric strain tensors @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 into our macroscopic theory . the matrix strain tensor may possibly be derived from the matrix displacement field @xmath20/2 $ ] in the linear regime . however , we remark that for polymers @xcite and viscoelastic materials in general @xcite this approach may already be questioned . in the present case ,",
    "this approach is not appropriate any more for our coupling zones and inclusions , if they are mesoscopically localized .",
    "one would , in that approach , first locally average the displacements to obtain the displacement field and then , from that displacement field , derive the strain tensor .",
    "however , for instance during a symmetric strain deformation , the displacements already vanish when averaged over one single mesoscopic inclusion , see further fig .",

    "in contrast to that , first averaging mesoscopic displacement fields for the inclusions leads to erroneous results .",
    "for instance , that part of the mesoscopic displacement field describing the strain deformations ( indicated by the arrows ) averaged over only one inclusion vanishes for symmetric strains .",
    "the same may apply by averaging over different inclusions , for instance those parts located within the black box .",
    ", width=321 ]    therefore , during a coarse - graining procedure underlying our macroscopic description , it is not mesoscopic displacement fields but directly the strains of the inclusions that must be averaged .",
    "the macroscopic variable @xmath19 must be obtained by averaging over the strain tensors for all inclusions within the corresponding volume element .",
    "the same applies for the coupling zones .    in summary",

    "first , we disconnect in our linearized formulation the overall flow field @xmath36 from the stresses in the coupling zones and inclusions , i.e.  we set @xmath256 .",
    "thus the flow field @xmath36 is mainly connected to the matrix flow , which for a bulk matrix and a sufficiently low concentration of localized inclusions should represent a reasonable approximation .",
    "next , we do allow for non - vanishing @xmath266 and @xmath267 , even if the isolated inclusions only deform elastically in a reversible way .",
    "in this situation , @xmath268 does not imply irreversible topological processes inside the inclusions , such as disentanglements of polymer chains .",
    "rather , it represents the overdamped character of their deformation kinetics , for instance due to the embedding into and coupling to highly viscous coupling zones or matrix environments .",
    "finally , deformations are now transmitted from the matrix via the coupling zones to the inclusions ( and vice versa ) by ( quasi-)static energetic couplings , here given by elastic coefficients @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "illustratively , this means that the external pressure gradient generates flow and resulting distortions in the matrix . if the matrix is deformed , it is energetically most favorable for the coupling zones to deform in a similar way , at least to a certain degree .",
    "if the coupling zones are deformed , these strains are also partially transmitted to the inclusions .",
    "[ fig_poiseuille_fail ]  ( b ) shows the corresponding process , leading to a net steady flow and induced strains of all zones , just as what we would expect in this situation .    with all these insights at hand",
    ", we can further think of rheological applications . in our context of a poiseuille channel geometry",
    ", we may consider a periodically oscillating external pressure gradient @xmath271 . alternatively",
    ", a periodic tilting within the gravitational field would serve similar purpose .    as an illustration , we here briefly present results for the three different systems introduced in figs",
    ".  [ fig_poiseuille_elastic ] , [ fig_poiseuille_fail ]  ( a ) , and [ fig_poiseuille_fail ]  ( b ) .",
    "they are characterized by the material parameters as given in the corresponding figure captions .",
    "an oscillating external pressure gradient of the form @xmath272 is applied .",
    "for the three different systems , we numerically determined the oscillation amplitudes as well as the phase lags of their oscillations for the four quantities @xmath223 and @xmath224 ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "the results are plotted as a function of frequency @xmath273 in fig .",
    "[ fig_rheology ] . as may have been expected , the system in fig .",
    "[ fig_poiseuille_elastic ] characterized by completely reversibly strains and vanishing deformational damping ( @xmath274 ) shows a pronounced response at a certain resonance frequency , see fig .",
    "[ fig_rheology ]  ( a ) .",
    "the resonance is reflected by a significant variation in the phase shift of the response around the corresponding frequency , see fig .",
    "[ fig_rheology ]  ( d ) .",
    "switching on the damping via the coefficients @xmath260 for the two other systems [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_rheology ]  ( b ) and ( c ) ] naturally reduces resonance . as likewise may have been expected , the systems ( quasi-)statically follow the externally imposed pressure gradient at very low frequencies .",
    "they show vanishing response when they can not follow the external stimulus any more at too high frequencies . particularly for the third system , the increasing phase lag in fig .",
    "[ fig_rheology ]  ( f ) from @xmath223 to @xmath275 to @xmath276 to @xmath277 nicely illustrates how the external stimulus is sequentially handed over from quantity to quantity via their mutual couplings .",
    "when we developed our approach , we included three zones of possibly different strain deformations .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , this was , for instance , inspired by the observation in magnetic gels of a coupling zone around the inclusions that may have ( visco)elastic properties markedly different from the bulk of the matrix material @xcite . depending on the particular situation , this phenomenological division into three zones may naturally be adjusted . on the one hand , if a still more continuous transition between the properties of the inclusions and the bulk matrix needs to be modeled , the effect of even more intermediate strain variables may be included . on the other hand , as we noted in secs .",
    "[ sec : relstrains ] and [ sec : examples ] , it might not be necessary to include an explicit additional strain variable for all three zones .",
    "for instance , when rigid metallic particles are embedded in a polymer matrix , it can be conceivable to neglect the strain variable @xmath19 in the ( slow ) macroscopic dynamics .    during our presentation",
    ", one may have noticed that the couplings between our variables that excite relative translations or rotations are relatively sparse .",
    "nevertheless , we included these variable because they will become important in more complex situations . here",
    ", we found that relative translations can be induced by gradients in the temperature or relative chemical potential via the dissipative current in eq .",
    "( [ eq_qdis ] ) . another physical way would be to create phase shifts between the displacement dynamics of different components of the material .",
    "for instance , shaking the whole block of material up and down may induce an out - of - phase swinging of the inclusions against the matrix . in our present hydrodynamic approach",
    ", such situations are not included .",
    "we only use one variable for the ( overall ) momentum density @xmath264 .",
    "this implies a pronounced coupling between the different components of the material .",
    "in particular , overdamped and irreversible processes favor such restrictions . to resolve more decoupled problems , where individual components may swing relatively to each other , separate momentum densities for the different components need to be introduced .",
    "yet , as becomes clear from the present study , in addition to separate velocity fields @xmath278 and @xmath279 for the coupling zones and inclusions , also separate dynamic fields @xmath280 and @xmath281 as well as @xmath282 and @xmath265 for their rotations and strains , respectively , may be necessary .",
    "similarly to the strains @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which in general can not be obtained from coarse - grained macroscopic displacement fields @xmath283 and @xmath0 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : variables ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : no_inclusion_displfield ] , @xmath282 and @xmath265 in general can not be obtained from coarse - grained macroscopic velocity fields @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "establishing corresponding two- or three - fluid hydrodynamic descriptions @xcite for ( visco)elastic composite materials will be an interesting subject for the future .",
    "finally , a different possibility to induce relative rotations arises for anisotropic inclusions .",
    "these may be selectively reoriented using externally applied fields .",
    "for instance , in liquid crystal elastomers @xcite , relative rotations were generated via external electric fields acting on the liquid crystalline component in a swollen state @xcite .",
    "likewise , anisotropic magnetic inclusions could be selectively reoriented by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we will report on a first application of our formalism to magnetic gels elsewhere .",
    "in this work , we described the behavior of ( visco)elastic composite materials using a macroscopic hydrodynamic approach based on symmetry arguments .",
    "we integrated into our characterization _ relative translations _ and _ relative rotations _ between a matrix and embedded inclusions .",
    "moreover , we explicitly took into account the possible deformability of the inclusions and their surroundings by macroscopic variables .",
    "for this purpose , different strain tensors were introduced to describe the possibly different deformational states of these material components . a reformulation of this kind of description revealed _ relative strains _ as a new macroscopic variable . during our motivation",
    ", we referred to polymeric materials as an illustration .",
    "there , situations are conceivable in which the dynamics of the inclusions or their immediate environment takes place on similar time scales as the macroscopic dynamics . moreover , interpenetrating polymer networks may likewise be addressed by our approach . yet , our derivation was based on symmetry principles only , not on specific chemical interaction details . therefore , it should apply to any other composite material featuring the necessary match in time scales .",
    "finally , if this match is not found and a separation in time scales prevails , our approach does not necessarily lose its significance completely . in that case , when the systems deform reversibly and are exposed to ( quasi)static fields , the static part of our theory based on the presented variables combined to an energy density may still be meaningful .",
    "it reflects the additionally important inner degrees of freedom in composite materials ."
