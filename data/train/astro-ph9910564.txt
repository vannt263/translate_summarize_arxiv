    "ic  10 , an irregular , low metallicity dwarf galaxy ( ibm or `` magellanic cloud '' type ) , is one of the most active star - forming galaxies in the local group .",
    "its galaxy - wide massive star surface density is comparable to that of the starburst regions of m  33 ( massey , armandroff , & conti 1992 ) . because ic  10 is a nearby system that in many ways resembles primeval galaxies ( morphologically irregular , metal - poor , and very actively forming stars ) we have targeted it for a study of the interstellar medium ( ism ) at submillimeter wavelengths that has direct relevance to star formation at high redshifts .",
    "this galaxy , at a distance of 0.82 mpc ( wilson et al .",
    "1996 ) , is comparable in mass and size to the small magellanic cloud .",
    "its metallicity ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 lequeux et al . 1979 ) falls between that of the large and the small magellanic clouds .",
    "ic  10 is an ideal laboratory to study the interaction between a metal - poor ism and strong radiation fields .",
    "metallicity greatly influences the composition and structure of the ism , especially when intense uv fields are present .",
    "photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) are those portions of the interstellar medium where uv radiation dominates the physical and chemical processes . because low metallicity pdrs have fewer heavy elements their gas phase chemistry is altered , changing the equilibrium abundances of the molecular species ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1988 ; lequeux et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the deficiency of heavy elements also lowers the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this in turn allows the uv radiation to penetrate more deeply into the molecular material , thereby causing widespread photodissociation and photoionization .",
    "the interaction between the starburst and the ism in a low metallicity system is thus maximized , as the uv photons permeate the ism relatively unimpeded .",
    "molecular hydrogen is largely unaffected by this enhanced uv radiation because of the strong h@xmath16 self - shielding and the mutual shielding between coincident lines of h and h@xmath16 ( abgrall et al .",
    "1992 ) , but co is strongly photodissociated .",
    "ionized carbon [ c  ii ] observations in ic  10 suggest the presence of vast quantities of molecular hydrogen not traced by co clouds ( madden et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "ic  10 is undergoing a burst of star formation , with the center of activity in its south - east portion .",
    "nonthermal emission , probably arising from a collection of supernova remnants ( yang & skillman 1993 ) , h@xmath16o megamaser emission ( henkel , wouterloot , & bally 1986 ; baan & haschick 1994 ) , one of the highest surface densities of wolf - rayet stars in the local group ( massey et al .",
    "1992 ) and one of the largest fir luminosities among dwarf galaxies ( melisse & israel 1994 ) all suggest current vigorous star formation activity .",
    "the ratio of wc types ( he burning wolf - rayet stars ) to wn types ( cno cycle wolf - rayet stars ) is also unusually high .",
    "this has been interpreted as an initial mass function skewed towards higher stellar masses ( massey & armandroff 1995 ) .",
    "neutral hydrogen maps of ic  10 show a complex structure characterized by many peaks and holes , an extended low brightness halo , and a complex velocity field ( shostak 1974 ; shostak & skillman 1989 ; wilcots & miller 1998 ) .",
    "the brightest h  i peak is located in the southern part of the galaxy and it is associated with a cluster of h  ii regions ( hodge & lee 1990 ) and a molecular cloud complex named ic  10-se ( becker 1990 ) .",
    "the center of star formation activity in ic  10 is located in close proximity to this h  i column density maximum .",
    "the co emission from ic  10 is relatively weak , as is usual in dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , tacconi & young 1987 ) , many of which appear to be deficient in molecular gas although quite actively forming stars .",
    "co was first detected by henkel et al .",
    "the molecular cloud complexes have been mapped using single dish observations by ohta , sasaki , & sait ( 1988 ) and becker ( 1990 ) , and interferometrically by wilson & reid ( 1991 ) , ohta et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and wilson ( 1995 ) .",
    "the co intensity to h@xmath16 column density conversion factor @xmath17 strongly depends on the metallicity of the clouds ( wilson 1995 ; arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto 1996 ; israel 1997 ) .",
    "this dependency explains why some dwarf irregular galaxies appear to be forming stars much more efficiently than the milky way ; much of their molecular gas is not well traced by co.    in this paper we present observations of the [ c  i ] ( @xmath18 ) and co ( @xmath3 ) , two of the most important submillimeter cooling lines of the ism , together with the dust continuum of the molecular cloud complex ic  10-se .",
    "neutral carbon is the byproduct of the photodissociation of co , created when uv photons impinge on the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "thus the [ c  i ] @xmath0p@xmath1p@xmath2 fine structure transition is thought to trace the photodissociation region ( pdr ) , the transition zone at low extinction ( @xmath193 ) where uv radiation dissociates the skin of co clumps .",
    "the co ( @xmath3 ) rotational transition typically traces moderately warm ( @xmath20 k ) and dense ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) molecular gas , although determining a precise @xmath23 and @xmath24 requires detailed modelling of several spectral lines .",
    "we observed the [ c  i ] fine structure line at 492.1607 ghz , the @xmath4co ( @xmath3 ) rotational transition at 345.7960 ghz and the @xmath5co ( @xmath3 ) rotational line at 330.5879 ghz toward ic  10-se using the 15 meter james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "these observations were performed in the remote observing mode , during 8 half shifts from 18 to 28 july 1997 . pointing and",
    "focus were checked at the beginning of each 4 hour long observing segment .",
    "standard flux calibrators were observed before and after the ic  10 observations , and their intensities were found to be within 30% ( @xmath25 ) of their accepted values .",
    "calibration was performed every 20 minutes using the standard chopper wheel method with warm ( ambient temperature ) and cold loads .",
    "the [ c  i ] line was observed using the rxc2 sis receiver , with @xmath26 and hpbw=10.8  .",
    "the @xmath27 zenith opacity was in the range 0.04 to 0.05 , resulting in system temperatures @xmath28 k. when the weather did not allow [ c  i ] observations we switched to our backup program , observing co ( @xmath3 ) with the rxb3 sis receiver , @xmath29 and hpbw=13.2  .",
    "the @xmath27 opacity at this time was in the range 0.12 to 0.16 with corresponding system temperatures @xmath30 k for @xmath4co and @xmath31 k for @xmath5co .",
    "the back - end was the digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das ) .",
    "the [ c  i ] observations were performed in the das 500 mhz bandwidth mode , resulting in a spectral resolution of 374 khz ( 0.23 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the co observations were accomplished using the das 760 mhz bandwidth mode with a resolution of 750 khz ( 0.65 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "we observed [ c  i ] towards 6 positions in the molecular cloud complex ic  10-se .",
    "three of them correspond to the three clumps identified by wilson & reid ( 1991 ) using co ( @xmath18 ) interferometric observations .",
    "the other three positions were arranged to obtain a slice across the complex , along an axis roughly oriented towards the nearest cluster of h  ii regions .",
    "the [ c  i ] observations of clumps mc1 , mc2 and mc3 on ic  10-se ( wilson , & reid 1991 ) were performed in position switching mode , switching 30 away in azimuth .",
    "the rest of the observations were performed in beam switching mode , chopping with the secondary mirror 180  away at a frequency of 1 hz .",
    "this technique resulted in better baselines with no obvious problems of emission in the reference position .",
    "first order baselines were removed from each spectrum and the individual 5 minute integrations were coadded . after averaging ,",
    "the [ c  i ] spectra were hanning smoothed to 3 mhz ( @xmath32 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ spectra ] and compiled in tables [ tabci ] and [ tabco ] .",
    "the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) 850  and 1350  observations were performed in service mode during the nights of 27 september , 10 november and 23 december 1997 .",
    "scuba s 850  and 1350  beam sizes are respectively 14  and 18  ( holland et al . 1999 ) .",
    "one 64-position jiggle map was obtained at 850  ( fig .",
    "[ scuba ] ) , by imaging a field @xmath33 arcmin in diameter centered ne of the ic  10-se molecular cloud complex and containing it , as well as several nearby h  ii regions ( hodge & lee 1990 ) .",
    "the observations were performed in three different sessions , with a typical zenith sky transmission at 850  of 70% ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we used a chopper throw of 120  in azimuth , and the total accumulated integration time was 128 minutes . pointing was checked before each observing session and found to be within 2  .",
    "calibration was performed using uranus and mars .",
    "simultaneous 450  data were acquired using scuba s short - wavelength array , but due to the poor weather ( @xmath35 ) these observations did not yield any useful data .",
    "the 1350 observations were performed using one of scuba s photometric pixels , acquiring one point at a time in a five point map centered on ic  10-se and chopping 60  , with an integration of 3 minutes per point . only the center position ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) yielded a significant detection with a flux density of @xmath38 mjy .",
    "in this section we compare our co observations with existing single - dish and interferometric data of ic  10-se . with this comparison we aim to : 1 )",
    "refine our determinations of line ratios by improving the alignment of the maps and 2 ) discuss possible excitation gradients in the source .",
    "figure [ ovroco ] shows a comparison of our observations with wilson & reid s ( 1991 ) interferometric @xmath4co ( @xmath18 ) measurements convolved to the jcmt s beam .",
    "the agreement is extremely good after displacing the ovro map 2  to the north of its nominal coordinates .",
    "such an offset can be caused by errors in the jcmt pointing model , which has a typical rms of 1.5  , or poor phase calibration in the interferometric data which can introduce displacements of order half a synthesized beam .",
    "although either telescope can be the source of this discrepancy , in this work we have chosen to move the ovro map for convenience . to compute the @xmath39}/i_{co}$ ] ratios discussed in  [ ratios ] we have used the displaced ovro data .",
    "although petitpas & wilson ( 1998 ) studied the co excitation in this complex for the central position , our new data reveal the spatial distribution .",
    "figure [ texrat ] shows the ratio of planck - corrected peak antenna temperature ( i.e. , the temperature of a blackbody that would emit as much power as is detected by the antenna ) for the @xmath3 and @xmath40 transitions ( becker 1990 ; iram 30 meter telescope ) , computed as ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the energy of the transition expressed in temperature units , @xmath43 is the measured rayleigh - jeans antenna temperature , and @xmath44 is the cosmic microwave background contribution at the frequency of interest . because both sets of observations have very similar beam sizes no convolution is necessary ( note that the iram map is not nyquist - sampled , therefore we are losing some spatial information ) .",
    "the planck - corrected antenna temperature ratio is @xmath45 ( @xmath460.550.7 ) throughout ic  10-se , consistent with thermalized gas ( i.e. , gas with kinetic temperature equal to the excitation temperature , t@xmath47t@xmath48 ) at a temperature higher than the excitation energy of the @xmath49 level ( i.e. , t@xmath50 k ) .",
    "thermalization is most easily attained if the gas is optically thick .",
    "the @xmath4co/@xmath5co ratio of the integrated line intensities listed in table [ tab13co ] also suggests optically thick @xmath4co gas at the positions of the three main molecular clumps ( mc1 , mc2 and mc3 ) . although there are no estimates of the @xmath4c/@xmath5c abundance ratio in ic  10 , the measured @xmath4co/@xmath5co line ratio is @xmath51 for each of the three clumps , much smaller than the typical @xmath4c/@xmath5c@xmath52 isotopic ratio in galactic or lmc molecular clouds ( e.g. , langer & penzias 1990 ; johansson et al .",
    "1994 ) . at the position sl2",
    ", however , no @xmath5co is detected in spite of the strong @xmath4co emission .",
    "this may be caused by a smaller co optical depth at the edge of the complex , which is consistent with the lack of strong emission at the position of sl2 in the co ( @xmath18 ) interferometric map ( wilson & reid 1991 ) .",
    "table [ tabco ] shows that the linewidths of the @xmath4co spectra are systematically larger than those of [ c  i ] by a factor of @xmath53 at the positions of the main molecular clumps , while the [ c  i]/co linewidth ratio decreases to @xmath54 for sl2 , at the edge of the complex .",
    "the broadening of spectral lines in the ism is usually attributed to either optical depth or doppler ( turbulent ) effects such those in macroturbulent models ( e.g. , wolfire , hollenbach & tielens 1993 ) .",
    "the linewidth ratios are thus consistent with an increasing optical depth towards the center of the complex . in particular , the linewidth ratio of @xmath55 towards sl2 is consistent with the lower co optical depth deduced from the @xmath4co/@xmath5co line ratio . if the line profiles are instead caused by macroturbulence the linewidths will be dominated by the clump - to - clump velocity dispersion",
    ". a [ c  i ] linewidth systematically smaller than its co counterpart can only be understood if the [ c  i ] emission arises solely from a fraction of the clumps featuring a smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "this , in turn , would imply that the [ c  i ] emitting clumps are localized within a distinct region inside our beam .",
    "the interpretation of the observed [ c  i ] linewidths as arising from macroturbulence requires , however , optically thick [ c  i ] emission from individual clumps which we consider extremely unlikely .      as discussed in  [ intro ] , the strong interaction between uv fields and the ism in low metallicity environments leads us to expect that the photodissociation products of co will be enhanced in these systems . because low metallicity systems require a larger column of molecular gas to achieve the uv extinction at which co begins to form ( @xmath56 ) , we expect an increase in the [ c  i]/co intensity ratio in metal - poor clouds compared with molecular clouds in the milky way ( bolatto et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "there are few observations of [ c  i ] in systems of low metallicity .",
    "wilson ( 1997 ) measured the atomic carbon emission from four individual molecular clouds in m33 , a galaxy with a well studied metallicity gradient .",
    "wilson finds [ c  i]/co integrated intensity ratios in the range 0.180.04 with an average @xmath57 ( intensities in erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 sr@xmath8 ) .",
    "this ratio is very similar to that of galactic clouds , and there is no apparent enhancement in the two clouds with lower metallicity .",
    "it is , however , difficult to interpret this result because of the lack of other diagnostics in these sources ( e.g. , [ c  ii ] measurements ) .    using the convolved interferometric co ( @xmath18 ) data ( wilson & reid 1991 ) we have computed the i@xmath58}$]/i@xmath59 ratio for our 6 pointings ( table [ tabco ] ) .",
    "the average integrated [ c  i]/co intensity ratio for ic  10-se is @xmath60 when the intensities are in rayleigh - jeans observational brightness units of k km s@xmath8 , or equivalently @xmath61 when the intensities are expressed in units of erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 sr@xmath8 .",
    "notice that this ratio is in principle an upper limit , since part of the co flux may be resolved out by the interferometer .",
    "this result is similar to the [ c  i]/co@xmath62 ratio observed by stark et al .",
    "( 1997 ) towards n159-w in the large magellanic cloud , and @xmath63% larger than the cobe firas galaxy - wide ratio of @xmath64 ( wright et al .",
    "such similarity is surprising in light of the factor of 4 in metallicity spanned by these sources , and the disparity in their [ c  ii ] intensities .",
    "bolatto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) developed a model for the [ c  i]/co intensity ratio as a function of metallicity . according to this model ,",
    "a roughly constant [ c  i]/co ratio is difficult to understand if most of the neutral carbon is predominantly produced by uv and is thus located in the pdr , the size of which must obey relatively simple scaling laws with metallicity . in the context of this model",
    "we can only understand a constant [ c  i]/co ratio if most of the c@xmath11 is not produced by photodissociation but by other chemical processes ( e.g. , an enhanced charge exchange reaction c@xmath10 + s @xmath65 c + s@xmath10 ) , either in the surfaces of co clumps or well mixed within the co cores .",
    "otherwise we expect a sharp increase in the [ c  i]/co ratio with decreasing metallicity , mostly owed to the decreasing size of the co cores in the clumps .",
    "such an increase is apparent in the data for the [ c  ii]/co ratio , not a surprise since the dominant c@xmath10 source is clearly uv photodissociation .",
    "this dichotomy in the behaviour of c@xmath10 and c@xmath11 points to , in our opinion , different dominant origin mechanisms for c@xmath10 and c@xmath11 .",
    "figure [ slice ] shows the variation in the [ c  i ] to co ( @xmath3 ) ratio across the ic  10-se complex .",
    "both the ratio of integrated intensities and the ratio of peak intensities remain constant along the slice within the errors .",
    "this indicates that [ c  i ] and co emission are coextensive and we are not resolving the c@xmath11/co transition , not a surprise given that the jcmt [ c  i ] beam subtends @xmath66 pc at the distance of ic  10 . towards the ends of the strip , at potentially interesting places to observe changes in the [ c  i]/co ratio , the signals are very weak and we lack the signal - to - noise necessary to measure this ratio . in the case of ic  10-se the peak intensity ratio is on average about twice the integrated intensity ratio , reflecting the difference in linewidths discussed in  [ comparison ] .    using the observed intensities of [ c  ii ] , [ c  i ] and",
    "co we can compute the relative abundances of the three dominant forms of carbon in this source . to this effect",
    "we will use eqs . 20 from bolatto",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , which are accurate to within factors of @xmath67 for [ c  i ] and [ c  ii ] under a wide range of conditions .",

    "the resulting column densities are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 @xmath9 .",
    "petitpas & wilson ( 1998 ) obtained a somewhat larger column density @xmath74 @xmath9 from a multiline excitation analysis , albeit in a larger beam ( 22  ) that only partially contains mc1 ( it is displaced 14  from our position ) .",
    "furthermore , using the total column density of hydrogen derived from the dust continuum measurements discussed in the following section ( c.f . ,",
    "table [ tabsol ] ) the c relative abundance is @xmath75 . this is a factor of 4 smaller than the c abundance in a typical milky way cloud like @xmath76oph ( duley & williams 1984 ) , which is consistent with the metallicity of ic  10-se .    therefore , unless there are strong local enhancements of @xmath77 , co is the dominant form of carbon in the molecular peaks of ic  10-se .",
    "it has been found , however , that in general co is a poor tracer of molecular gas in dwarf galaxies as it is discussed in  [ intro ] .",
    "for example , mochizuki et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find that the distribution of [ c  ii ] emission in the large magellanic cloud is very different from the co. is this the case too in ic  10 ?",
    "ic  10-se is the molecular peak of this galaxy and one of the few regions with enough extinction to form co clouds ( e.g. , becker 1990 ) .",
    "the measurements by madden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show other places in ic  10 with very large i@xmath78}$]/i@xmath59 ratios ( e.g. , position d is a [ c  ii ] peak with no known co counterpart ) .",
    "thus , although locally co is preponderant in ic  10-se , c@xmath10 is likely to be the globally dominant form of carbon in this galaxy .",
    "dust grains heated by starlight are the main source of the fir continuum emission .",
    "since dust is also the source of uv extinction , it determines the distribution of the photodissociated gas .",
    "the thermal dust continuum contains information about the total mass of molecular gas and the radiation field that is heating the grains , which can be compared with estimates obtained by other methods . finally , the emissivity law of the dust particles yields information on the composition of the dust grains and their size distribution . in this section",
    "we present the first determination of the submillimeter dust emissivity in a metal - poor system .",
    "figure [ scuba ] shows the thermal dust continuum at 850 @xmath12 m , imaged with scuba down to a @xmath79 sensitivity of @xmath80 mjy / beam .",
    "the peak of the emission is coincident with the molecular cloud complex ic  10-se , with a northern extension and a fainter se - nw ridge of emission both associated with cluster of h  ii regions and in overall shape and dimensions very similar to the single dish co j=@xmath81 map ( becker 1990 ) and the 6 cm radio - continuum observations of yang & skillman ( 1993 ) .",
    "figure [ blue ] shows the dust continuum overlayed on a deep optical ( b band ) picture of the galaxy .",
    "not surprisingly , the peak of scuba emission is associated with an obscuration lane situated very close to the center of star formation activity in ic  10 .",
    "after convolving these observations to the resolution of previous fir maps of this source ( @xmath82 hpbw , equivalent to @xmath83 pc at the adopted distance ; thronson et al .",
    "1990 ) , we find that the general morphology is well preserved although there is a displacement of order 30  between the 95 or 155 @xmath12 m kao data and the 850 @xmath12 m scuba map ( fig .",
    "[ kao ] ) .",
    "although the estimated @xmath79 positional uncertainty of the kao data is 10  , we consider that the observed displacement is an artifact of pointing .",
    "notice that while the co , c@xmath10 and 850 @xmath12 m peaks are all coincident , the best correlation between the fir map in thoronson et al . and the c@xmath10 and co data is obtained only after such an offset is applied to the fir map ( madden et al .",
    "unfortunatly the iras hires maps of this region can not be used to further clarify this point , since their positional accuracy is only about 30 ",
    "( incidentally , the hires peak falls between the kao and the scuba positions ) .",
    "the experience at kao suggests that , while uncommon , such pointing errors are entirely possible .",
    "this is especially true during the observation of faint irregular galaxies when it is impossible to autoguide on the source itself ( harper 1999 ) , as was the case for ic  10 .",
    "therefore , we consider that the 30  displacement is most likely a registration offset caused by an error in the kao pointing , and in our continuum analysis we use the peak values of the source in each map .",
    "using the nominal fir values at the position of the 850 @xmath12 m peak ( @xmath84 jy , @xmath85 jy ) only causes a moderate shift in the temperature of the solution , without altering the conclusions ( the solution for the free - free corrected 95 , 155 , 850 , and 1300 @xmath12 m points would then be @xmath86 k , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the iras hires point at 60 @xmath12 m can not be used because of the uncertainty in its position ) .    to compare our submillimeter measurements with the fir data",
    "it is necessary to convolve them to a common angular resolution .",
    "this is a problem for the 1350 @xmath12 m data , for which we have only a single pointing with hpbw 18  . to overcome this problem we include data from a 1.3 mm continuum map of ic  10 taken at iram .",
    "the corresponding flux density of this region is 280 mjy in a 50  beam ( wild 1998 ) .",
    "the fir / submillimeter measurements are summarized in table [ tabcont ] .    for a modified blackbody ( a graybody )",
    "the opacity @xmath89 is a function of wavelength of the form    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the graybody emissivity exponent , and @xmath92 is the wavelength at which the emission becomes optically thick .",
    "accordingly , the thermal emission from a graybody can be expressed as    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the observed flux density , @xmath95 is the source solid angle , and @xmath96 is planck s function . in the optically thin regime",
    "a simultaneous determination of the source size and opacity is impossible , and we can only determine the product @xmath97 .",
    "we set @xmath98 sr@xmath8 and the opacity thus determined is an average over the beam .",
    "the dust opacity in the fir - submillimeter regime is generally very small ( @xmath99 ) . in the optically thin limit",
    "the opacity is related to the hydrogen column density by @xmath100 and thus    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the dust opacity per hydrogen atom per @xmath103 in the diffuse ism ( the canonical dust cross - section ) , @xmath104 is a numerical factor ( see below ) , and the hydrogen column density is @xmath105 .",
    "the relationship between the opacity and the hydrogen column density can be expressed as    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the metallicity of the gas relative to the sun , @xmath108 is the value of @xmath102 at a wavelength of 1 mm and solar metallicity , @xmath109 is the wavelength in mm and it is implicitly assumed that the dust - to - gas ratio is proportional to the metallicity .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath104 is of order unity and depends on the grain environment : @xmath110 for the dust in the diffuse interstellar medium considered by draine & lee ( 1984 ) , @xmath111 for dust in deeply embedded sources where ice mantles form on the grain surfaces , @xmath112 in environments where grain destruction is occurring ( mezger , wink , & zylka 1990 ; braine et al .",
    "ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) have modeled the opacity of interstellar grain aggregates in a variety of physical conditions applicable to protostellar cores ( i.e. , highly embedded sources ) .",
    "they find that for such sources the submillimeter opacity per unit dust mass can be a factor of 5 larger on average than in the diffuse interstellar medium , implying @xmath113 .",
    "the increased opacity in these environments is caused by the formation of thick ice mantles and the coagulation of fluffy particle aggregates ( e.g. , fogel & leung , 1998 ) .",
    "the theoretical estimate for the dust opacity per hydrogen atom is @xmath114 @xmath115 in diffuse gas ( draine & lee 1984 ) , while observations place this number a factor of 1.21.7 higher in a wide range of objects ( braine et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",

    "the solutions were computed using the 60 , 95 , 155 , 850 and 1300 @xmath12 m points listed in table [ tabcont ] .",
    "the best - fit single temperature graybody solution to the flux density has a very shallow slope in the rayleigh - jeans limit , corresponding to a fir - submillimeter emissivity exponent @xmath116 at a temperature @xmath117 k with an opacity at 1 mm @xmath118 ( notice that this solution is slightly different from the median solution in the monte carlo listed in table [ tabsol ] ) .",

    "in fact , the slope derived from the 850 and 1300 @xmath12 m measurements alone is @xmath121 , very close to a blackbody .",
    "this extremely shallow emissivity is unusual .",
    "grain emissivity exponents for different materials are thought to be in the range @xmath122 , corresponding to amorphous ( @xmath123 ) and metallic or crystalline ( @xmath124 ) structure ( e.g. , draine & lee 1984 ; tielens & allamandola 1987 ; mennella , colangelli , & bussoletti 1995 ) .",
    "astronomical measurements generally confirm this result for both galactic ( e.g. , knapp , sandell , & robson 1993 ) and extragalactic sources ( e.g. , hughes , gear , & robson 1994 ) .",
    "the grain emissivity may be influenced by environmental characteristics , mainly the interstellar radiation field .",
    "ic  10-se is in close proximity to the most luminous h  ii region in ic  10 ( region 111 , hodge & lee 1990 ) .",
    "this region has an h@xmath125 flux of @xmath126 erg s@xmath8 @xmath103 , and consequently a luminosity @xmath127 erg s@xmath8 ( assuming an extinction correction @xmath128 and @xmath129 kpc ; thronson et al . 1990 ; wilson et al .",
    "1996 ) , or about four times as luminous as the orion nebula ( kennicutt 1984 ) . we can estimate the average radiation field in this region by assuming that all the starlight is reradiated in the fir . using our graybody solution ,",
    "the observed fir surface brightness is @xmath130 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 beam@xmath8 , resulting in a flux @xmath131 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "this is equivalent to an average radiation field @xmath132 over a region 200 pc in diameter , where @xmath133 is the standard radiation field in the vicinity of the sun ( @xmath134 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 ; habing 1968 ) .",
    "most of the submillimeter emission comes from a region @xmath135 ",
    "( @xmath136 pc ) wide .",
    "assuming that all the flux originates in that region , its radiation field is @xmath137 .",
    "this value is probably an underestimate , since we are neglecting : _ 1 ) _ the contribution of the stochastically heated small grains , which will produce excess radiation shortwards of 100 @xmath12 m and increase the integrated fir flux , and _ 2 ) _ the possibility that any form of radiation other than fir is escaping the region ( i.e. , we assume 100% uv to fir conversion efficiency ) .",
    "nevertheless , this estimate is about a factor of four higher than the average radiation field in the orion region where @xmath138 ( over scales of tens of parsecs ; stacey et al .",
    "1993 ) and agrees very well with estimates for @xmath139 based on [ c  ii ] data for the same region ( madden et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "contamination by free - free radiation is a possible cause for a shallow long wavelength slope in the graybody solution .",
    "optically thin thermal free - free emission has a flat spectrum ( @xmath140 ) that we can remove from the longer wavelength data to increase the slope of the graybody in the rayleigh - jeans limit . to obtain @xmath91=12",
    "using solely the two longest frequency measurements , the contribution from the free - free radiation should be @xmath141120190 mjy at @xmath142 mm .",
    "one way to assess how much free - free is contaminating our fluxes is to simultaneously fit the graybody and the free - free emission ( 4 free parameters , 5 data points ) .",
    "doing so results in only 7 mjy free - free at 1 mm , therefore we expect a rather small free - free contamination in our continuum data .",
    "klein & grve ( 1986 ) found that the galaxy - wide flux density for ic  10 at 6.3 cm is 222 mjy with a spectral index @xmath143 , slightly steeper than purely thermal bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the spectral index flattens to @xmath144 @xmath145 at the location of the two emission peaks , one of which appears to be associated to ic  10-se ( peak `` b '' for klein & grve ) .",
    "assuming @xmath146 , these numbers predict a free - free contribution to the spectral density @xmath147 mjy at 1 mm , with roughly  of the flux originating in the southernmost component identified with ic  10-se .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath148 mjy . removing this contribution from the observed fluxes will raise @xmath91 to about 0.5 when fitting all data points .",
    "thus , we find that although contamination by bremsstrahlung radiation should be taken into account when deriving the graybody solution , it is not enough to bring the graybody emissivity exponent up to @xmath149 .",
    "how much can we trust our determination of the submillimeter emissivity ?",
    "we have performed a @xmath150 points monte carlo analysis on the free - free corrected measurements , assuming independent gaussian errors with @xmath25 deviations according to table [ tabcont ] ( the assumed @xmath25 deviations in flux correspond to 50% calibration errors ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure [ bbloc ] and allow us to discard emissivity exponents @xmath151 as statistically very improbable .",
    "another possible source of error is a bad data point , or a systematic calibration difference among the different telescopes . eliminating the data from any one of the telescopes listed in table [ tabcont ] , however , still results in an emissivity exponent very close to zero for the fit to the remaining data . both kao points , for example , need to be raised by a factor of @xmath67 to produce @xmath152 when fitting all five measurements .",
    "although this is not impossible , we find unlikely that a bad data point or a systematic calibration difference is causing our low @xmath91 result .",
    "a third possibility is the presence of a substantial mass of very cold dust in the line of sight .",
    "since we have five measurements , we can fit a two temperature component graybody with an arbitrary emissivity .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tabsol ] . to determine if an important component of cold dust is a possibility we will compute the mass of cold dust and compare it to virial estimates for the mass of this region .",
    "although a large mass of cold dust is consistent with the shape of the submillimeter continuum , such a cold dust component would contain so much mass that it is inconsistent with the observed column density of hydrogen .",
    "the h  i distribution for ic  10 peaks in the ic  10-se region , at a column density of @xmath153 @xmath9 imaged with a 30  beam ( shostak & skillman 1989 ) .",
    "single dish co observations ( becker 1990 ) , when corrected by metallicity effects ( wilson 1995 ) , imply a molecular hydrogen column density @xmath154(h@xmath16)@xmath155 @xmath9 for ic  10-se ( see also petitpas & wilson , 1998 ) .",
    "the total column density of hydrogen is thus @xmath156 @xmath9 .",
    "this figure agrees very well with the estimate based on the low emissivity graybody models setting @xmath157 ( c.f . ,",
    "table [ tabsol ] ) , and is smaller than the column densities predicted by the two temperature models by about _ a factor of 10_. as we discussed before , highly embedded sources may have @xmath104 as large as 5 , which will diminish this discrepancy to a factor of about 2 .",
    "the gas intermixed with such a cold dust component should be molecular and emit strongly in co @xmath18 but little or nothing in the @xmath40 transition .",
    "its emissivity will probably be about a factor of 4 smaller than the molecular gas associated with the warm component ( i.e. , the ratio of dust temperatures in the two components ) , and thus could be conceivably `` masked '' by the warmer gas associated with active star - forming regions .",
    "if we adopt the @xmath158 two - temperature solution in table [ tabsol ] and proceed to correct down the expected @xmath159 column density by a factor of @xmath160 , we obtain a cold co ( @xmath18 ) emissivity a factor of @xmath67 larger than that of the warm co. therefore , we should see about 3 times more flux in co ( @xmath18 ) than in co ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we will compare now this expectation with observations . a multiline excitation analysis of ic  10-se has been performed by petitpas & wilson ( 1998 ) .",
    "no unique solution was found by the authors , which they attribute to the presence of two density components .",
    "another possible explanation , however , would be the existence of two temperature components .",
    "the observed main beam line temperature ratio is @xmath4co ( @xmath40)/(@xmath18)=@xmath161 , somewhat smaller than the typical line ratio for @xmath4co in milky way clouds ( about 0.8 ) , but not as low as our reasoning in the previous paragraph leads us to expect .",
    "this is , however , further complicated by the fact that @xmath4co is most probably optically thick",
    ". a more useful probe ( but much more difficult to observe ) would be an optically thin isotopomer like c@xmath162o . there are also no signs of self absorption in the @xmath4co ( @xmath18 ) spectra ( e.g. , becker 1990 ) , as expected if some of the cold co is located in front of the warm co along the line of sight . notice that this hypothetical very cold gas component can not be the source of the excess [ c  ii ] emission observed by madden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) since the 158 @xmath12 m transition requires 91 k to be excited .",
    "hence , although we can not conclusively discard the possibility a substantial mass of cold dust with the present data , we consider a two temperature model with a dominant cold dust fraction very unlikely and conclude that the submillimeter emissivity exponent of the dust in this environment is intrinsically small .",
    "thus , we have explored and find unlikely the possibility of calibration errors , free - free radiation and cold dust as the plausible causes of the low emissivity exponent that we observe in this source .",
    "such a shallow emissivity must then be intrinsic , and related to some unique characteristic of ic  10-se such as its low metallicity and high radiation field .",
    "calculations show that for sufficiently small graphite grains the photon absorption cross - section @xmath163 is independent of the grain size @xmath164 and temperature @xmath23 , as electric dipole absorption is the dominant mechanism ( draine & lee 1984 ) . for larger grains ( @xmath165 @xmath12 m )",
    "magnetic dipole absorption becomes important and @xmath163 shows a strong temperature dependence for wavelengths longwards of 100 @xmath12 m , as well as a weaker dependence on @xmath166 which translates into a shallower emissivity ( c.f .",
    ", figure 4b of draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "quantitatively , however , inspection of figure 4b reveals that @xmath167 for the largest and hottest graphite grains and @xmath1682 otherwise ( silicate grains and smaller graphite grains ) , values typical for crystalline materials .",
    "there are no similar calculations for amorphous carbonaceous materials , which laboratory measurements show to have @xmath1691.3 ( menella et al .",
    "1995 ) . hence",
    ", although theory suggests that a small @xmath91 is possible if small grains are absent and the dust size distribution is dominated by large grains , there is no actual quantitative support for @xmath13 .",
    "observational evidence for small grain destruction in starburst environments similar to ic  10-se has been found by several studies , for example : pah destruction in the core of m82 ( normand et al .",
    "1995 ) , gas phase silicon enhancement associated with silicate grain destruction by supernovae - driven shocks ( lord et al .",
    "1996 ) , fir color - uv field correlation caused by small grain evaporation ( telesco , decher , & joy 1989 ; boulanger et al .",
    "1988 ) , and metallicity effects on the fir colors attributed to small grain destruction ( sauvage , thuan , & vigroux 1990 ) . in view of this , we consider possible that the small emissivity exponent of the thermal dust continuum results from small grain destruction occurring in an actively star - forming low metallicity environment .",
    "the continuum from the nucleus of m  82 has been studied in detail by hughes et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who found for it a normal emissivity exponent ( @xmath170 ) despite the high radiation field ( @xmath171 in the central region , @xmath172 over a larger extent ; stacey et al .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that the metallicity of the nucleus of m  82 is about 14 times larger than the metallicity of ic  10 ( alloin et al .",
    "the ratio of @xmath173 is then @xmath174 times larger for ic  10-se versus the central region of m  82 .",
    "naively , this would indicate a 3 times bigger `` effective '' radiation field ( i.e. , corrected by dust extinction ) in ic  10 . without detailed modelling of the physical processes involved in grain formation and destruction ,",
    "however , it is difficult to quantify the separate effects of @xmath175 and @xmath139 on the grain size distribution .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to point out that a high radiation field alone , such as the one found in the cores of starburst galaxies , may not be sufficient to produce as shallow an emissivity law as we observe in ic  10 .",
    "such a low @xmath91 may require both low metallicity and a high radiation field .",
    "this result , if confirmed , has potentially important implications for the recently opened field of continuum observations of young galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. , smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; barger et al .",
    "1998 ; barger , cowie , & sanders 1999 ) since it would affect the shape of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at long wavelengths .",
    "with equal @xmath23 and @xmath176 , a galaxy with smaller @xmath91 will be brighter in the rayleigh - jeans portion of its continuum . thus galaxy counting surveys would tend to be dominated by such sources , and backwards extrapolation from the current galaxy population using a standard sed with @xmath158 may considerably underpredict the observed galaxy counts at high redshifts .",
    "we have observed [ c  i ] , @xmath4co and @xmath5co ( j=@xmath177 ) , and dust continuum in the se region of ic  10 .",
    "this is one of the few submillimeter neutral carbon studies of a metal - poor system ( stark et al . 1997 ; wilson 1997 ) .",
    "we detected the [ c  i ] 609  line towards four out of six positions in ic  10-se , at the @xmath25 level or higher .",
    "all four points share a similar value of i@xmath178}/$]i@xmath179 ( in erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 sr@xmath8 ) .",
    "this ratio is similar to that observed in the orion region and most milky way sources ( i@xmath178}/$]i@xmath180 1015 ) , and the n  159 region in the large magellanic cloud ( i@xmath178}/$]i@xmath181 ) , in spite of these regions spanning a factor of 4 in metallicity and a factor of 3 in i@xmath78}/$]i@xmath59 .",
    "the similarity of the i@xmath58}/$]i@xmath59 ratio among sources of disparate metallicity is associated to the nature of the c@xmath10/c@xmath11/co transition in molecular clouds and possibly the structure of the clouds themselves ( bolatto et al .",
    "1999 ; pak et al .",
    "we believe that the observed trend of constant i@xmath178}/$]i@xmath182 ratio with decreasing metallicity and increasing i@xmath183}/$]i@xmath59 points to a non - pdr origin for most of the c@xmath11 in molecular clouds . while the final settling of this question must necessarily await for better statistics , the hints offered by these observations are tantalizing .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the submillimeter continuum is relatively shallow , resulting in a graybody emissivity exponent @xmath13 .",
    "it is unlikely that this small emissivity exponent is caused by errors in the measurements , a miscalibration of one of the telescopes , contamination of the thermal greybody spectrum by free - free emission or a substantial amount of cold dust along the line of sight , therefore we believe it is intrinsic .",
    "furthermore , the standard hydrogen column density estimate based upon the dust continuum emission agrees very well with the column density derived using other methods",
    ".    the physical cause of the shallow emissivity may be the destruction of small grains by uv radiation , which effectively penetrates farther into the ism in low metallicity environments with low dust - to - gas ratios .",
