    "the qcd lattice calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) of deconfined matter have advanced to such a level that reliable results for the pure gluon plasma are available @xcite .",

    "the eos of four light flavors @xcite are not yet continuum extrapolated .",
    "the physically interesting case of two light flavors and a medium - heavy strange quark is still in progress @xcite .",
    "all of these _ ab initio _ calculations of the eos of deconfined matter , however , are yet constrained to finite temperatures @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the deconfinement temperature ) and vanishing baryo - chemical potential , @xmath2 . while first attempts to calculate the eos at @xmath3 are under way @xcite , the final results can probably be expected only in a few years .",
    "it is therefore a challenge to attempt an extrapolation of the qcd lattice results into the domain of finite baryo - chemical potential .",
    "here we employ a quasi - particle model to accomplish this goal .",
    "quasi - particle models have proven powerful in describing properties of strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics .",
    "analogously , one should expect that also strongly interacting matter can be described effectively within quasi - particle models .",
    "indeed , the investigations of @xmath4-derivable self - consistent approximations @xcite , combined with hard thermal loop resummation @xcite , delivered recently compelling support of a quasi - particle description of deconfined matter . starting from the qcd lagrangian a chain of approximations is derived @xcite which results in a quasi - particle model of deconfined matter agreeing with lattice results at @xmath5 . on the other hand , employing the hard thermal / dense loop resummation at finite baryo - chemical potential , further evidence for a quasi - particle description of cold deconfined matter is gained @xcite .",
    "what is still needed is an interpolating model , which reproduces the qcd lattice data down to @xmath1 and , at the same time , extrapolates to finite values of @xmath6 even up to @xmath7 .",
    "we present here such a model and apply it to calculate static properties of cold , pure quark stars with strange quarks properly taken into account .",
    "with increasing sophistication of qcd lattice calculations of the eos also phenomenological quasi - particle models have been developed @xcite .",
    "of central importance to our model @xcite are the baryon density @xmath8 and the entropy density @xmath9 as quantities which are dominated by the quasi - particle structure of the interacting system .- derivable approach @xcite where corrections to the quasi - particle picture arise only beyond the resummed leading - loop order contributions @xcite . within the massless @xmath10 theory the form of @xmath9 below",

    "the quantity @xmath25 is not an independent quantity but obtained by integrating @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 which come from the stationarity condition @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "let us mention two implications of the quasi - particle model .",
    "( i ) according to the feynman - hellmann relation the chiral condensate is given by @xmath30 for @xmath31 , i.e. for vanishing current quark masses the chiral condensate vanishes in agreement with the chiral symmetry restoration at @xmath32 .",
    "( ii ) in the asymptotic region , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , an expansion in the coupling yields @xmath35 thus reproducing the perturbative results @xcite in the orders of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the effective coupling strength @xmath18 we chose a regularized parameterization of the 1-loop running coupling strength .",
    "the resulting comparison with the qcd lattice data is displayed in figure [ comparisons ] for various flavor numbers @xmath38 .",
    "notice the almost perfect agreement with the data which ensures that the other thermodynamical quantities are also nicely reproduced ( for details cf .",
    "our model assumes the validity of the underlying quasi - particle structure at finite @xmath6 .",
    "some limitation of this assumption may arise from the recently debated supra - fluidity and color - flavor locking effects at small temperatures and asymptotically large chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "however , since many of the discussed effects @xcite , which also depend sensitively on the actual strange quark mass ( as the phase diagram does already at @xmath2 @xcite ) , are near the fermi surface , the gross properties of the eos might not be modified strongly .    since the pressure @xmath21 is a potential it has to fulfill the maxwell relation @xmath40 , which results in a partial differential equation for the coupling of the form @xmath41    -5 mm    a solution for the 4-flavor lattice case @xcite",
    "is displayed in the left panel of figure [ characteristics ] .",
    "the strong increase of @xmath18 towards smaller values of @xmath20 and @xmath6 can be considered as an indication of approaching the phase boundary . despite of the fact that our model does not allow to make statements on the nature of the deconfinement transition",
    ", one can safely conclude that the region of smaller values of @xmath20 and @xmath6 , not covered by the elliptic characteristics shown in the right panel of figure [ characteristics ] , may be related to confined matter .",
    "the order of magnitude of the baryo - chemical potential @xmath42 for the innermost characteristics at @xmath7 is 1.4 gev when choosing the scale @xmath43 mev .",
    "thermodynamic state variables are available in tabular form in @xcite . at small",
    "@xmath20 , the pressure in the small-@xmath6 region becomes negative giving a lower bound for the existence of conventional deconfined matter .",
    "the energy per baryon , however , at the point of vanishing pressure is quite large , typically in the order of 1.5 gev for @xmath44 .",
    "that means , even when including strangeness , no hint to stable strangelets arises from our model .",
    "to condense the properties of the predicted eos in a few concise numbers let us consider pure quark stars with locally charge - neutral deconfined matter in @xmath45 equilibrium .",
    "the chemical potentials of u , d , s quarks and leptons ( @xmath46 ) are related according to @xmath47 . unfortunately , continuum extrapolated qcd lattice data for the 2 + 1 flavor case with physical quark masses are not yet at disposal at @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we first guess sets of eos for the 2 + 1 flavor case at @xmath2 and then extrapolate them to finite @xmath6 at @xmath7 . in doing",
    "so we are guided by the parameter range obtained in @xcite .",
    "adding to the pressure the lepton contribution it turns out that the energy density - pressure relation obtained numerically can be approximated by @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 mev .",
    "note that @xmath52 is not longer an _ ad hoc _ parameter in the spirit of the bag model but a parameter which will be fixed by improving the qcd lattice data for the 2 + 1 flavor case @xcite .",
    "integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations for spherical stars in hydrodynamical equilibrium up to vanishing pressure at the surface one gets the masses and radii as displayed in figure [ q_stars ] .",
    "since the estimated range of @xmath52 is @xmath53 mev , the strange quark stars have small masses ( @xmath54 ) and radii ( @xmath55 km ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that our model does not predict absolutely stable ( strange ) quark matter .",
    "rather , at smaller values of @xmath6 and @xmath56 the transition to hadron matter is expected to happen .",
    "the static properties of the corresponding hybrid stars depend sensitively on the nature of the confinement transition and details of the hadronic eos .",
    "in summary we present a quasi - particle model for the eos of purely deconfined matter , which describes the available qcd lattice calculations at @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and map this to finite values of the baryo - chemical potential including properly the strangeness degree of freedom .",
    "the model does not point to stable strangelets .",
    "the resulting cold , pure quark stars with strangeness are light and small .    at finite temperatures",
    "the strange quarks do not play any exceptional role : the self - energies mask nearly all of the finite - mass effect , even having used here @xmath57 mev , while recent lattice calculations point to smaller values @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with qcd lattice calculations which display for @xmath58 almost the same values for the 2 , 3 and 2 + 1 flavor cases @xcite .",
    "the gluon abundance near @xmath1 is strongly suppressed .",
