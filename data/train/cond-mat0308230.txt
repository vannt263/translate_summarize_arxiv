    "in a recent paper,@xcite henceforth referred to as i , we have shown that the mesoscopic persistent current in a normal - metal ring threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux has an analog in spin rings : specifically , we have calculated the persistent spin current @xmath7 in thermal equilibrium that circulates a ferromagnetic heisenberg ring subject to a crown - shaped magnetic field with magnitude @xmath8 . within linear spin - wave theory",
    "we have shown that the associated magnetization current @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath5 is the bohr magneton ) is of the form@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath2 is the circumference of the ring , @xmath12 is the energy dispersion , and @xmath13 is the velocity of the magnons , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the temperature . in the presence of a crown - shaped inhomogeneous magnetic field the direction of the magnetization in the classical ground state covers a finite solid angle @xmath16 on the unit sphere as we move once around the ring .",
    "then the bloch wave vectors are quantized as @xmath17 , where in the continuum approximation the allowed values of @xmath18 are @xmath19 .",
    "the magnetization current ( [ eq : issw ] ) vanishes for @xmath20 .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that no quantum fluctuations are present in a ferromagnet , so that at @xmath21 there are no magnons to carry the spin current .",
    "it is thus tempting to speculate that the analogous current for an antiferromagnetic heisenberg ring will be finite even at @xmath21 due to quantum fluctuations . in this work",
    "we shall show that this is indeed the case and present a quantitative calculation of the current in haldane - gap antiferromagnets ( i.e. , antiferromagnetic heisenberg rings with integer spin @xmath22 ) using a modified spin - wave theory .",
    "@xcite our main result is that the ground state of a haldane - gap spin ring subject to an inhomogeneous magnetic field supports a finite magnetization current , which in the limit where the staggered correlation length @xmath1 is large compared with @xmath2 has a sawtooth shape as a function of the geometric flux @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath3 is the spin - wave velocity . here",

    "the ring is endowed with an electric dipole moment even in the ground state .",
    "the absence of true long - range order in one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets leads for integer spin @xmath22 to a finite spin - correlation length @xmath1 and a haldane gap of the order of @xmath25 between the ground - state energy and the lowest triplet excitation .",

    "@xmath38 the zero - temperature charge current ( [ eq : sawtooth ] ) is formally identical with the zero - temperature magnetization current ( [ eq : sawtoothaf ] ) in a haldane - gap spin ring .",
    "finite temperature , disorder , and phase - breaking scattering all have a similar effect on the persistent charge current in one dimension .",
    "@xcite for a weak perturbation , they smooth the discontinuity around @xmath39 and with increasing strength higher harmonics are exponentially suppressed such that a sinusoidal shape is approached . in the limit of a very strong perturbation the current",
