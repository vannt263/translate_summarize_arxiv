    "with the support of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite , the new inflationary universe scenario @xcite is generally recognized to be the most likely explanation of the origin of the big bang .",
    "however , the origin of the inflaton and its potential is not well understood .",
    "recently , the brane world scenario suggested by superstring theory was proposed , where the standard model of the strong and electroweak interactions are open string ( brane ) modes while the graviton and the radions are closed string ( bulk ) modes .",
    "natural in the brane world is the brane inflation scenario @xcite , in which the inflaton is a brane mode identified with an inter - brane separation , while the inflaton potential emerges from the exchange of closed string modes between branes ; the latter is the dual of the one - loop partition function of the open string spectrum , a property well - studied in string theory @xcite .",
    "inflation ends when the branes collide , heating the universe that starts the big bang .",
    "this brane inflationary scenario may be realized in a number of ways @xcite .",
    "the scenario is simplest when the radion and the dilaton ( bulk ) modes are assumed to be stabilized by some unknown non - perturbative bulk dynamics .",
    "since the inflaton is a brane mode , and the inflaton potential is dictated by the brane mode spectrum , it is reasonable to assume that the inflaton potential is insensitive to the details of the bulk dynamics . as a consequence ,",
    "the overall brane inflationary picture is very robust @xcite .    because the inflaton and the ground state open string modes responsible for defect formation are different , and that the ground state open string modes become tachyonic and develop vacuum expectation values only towards the end of the inflationary epoch , various types of defects ( lower - dimensional branes ) may be formed .",
    "( the tachyonic modes themselves are in general not good inflaton candidates because their potentials are typically too steep for enough e - foldings . )",
    "apriori , defect production after inflation may be a serious problem .",
    "fortunately , it is argued in ref.@xcite that , following the properties of superstring / brane theory and the cosmological evolution of the universe , the only defects copiously produced are cosmic strings .",
    "( cosmic string properties in the early universe is a well - studied topic @xcite ) here , we elaborate on this point and consider some of its observational consequences :    * topologically , a variety of defects may be produced . because they have even codimensions with respect to the branes that collide , they have specific properties @xcite .",
    "* cosmologically , since the compactified dimensions tangent to the brane is smaller than the hubble size , the kibble mechanism works only if all the codimensions are tangent to the uncompactified dimensions . as a consequence , only cosmic strings",
    "may be copiously produced @xcite .",
    "* the cosmic strings may be d@xmath4-branes , but most likely , they are d@xmath0-branes wrapping around @xmath1-cycles in the compactified dimensions . in this case , the cosmic string tension @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the gauge coupling , with @xmath7 .",
    "* dynamically , open superstring field theory analysis @xcite strongly indicates that the tachyon potential has the form that gives a second order phase transition .",
    "this allows one to estimate the initial cosmic string density , which is close to one string segment per hubble volume .",
    "the resulting cosmic string network is expected to evolve to the scaling solution @xcite . * using the density perturbation in the cmb data from cobe @xcite , the superstring scale is estimated to be @xmath8 gev @xcite . with @xmath9 being the newton s constant , this yields @xmath3 . *",
    "this implies that the anisotropy in the cmb comes mostly from the inflationary epoch , while a component of order @xmath10 comes from cosmic strings .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with all present cmb data @xcite , but will be tested by map and planck .",
    "gravitational waves from this cosmic string network is likely to be measured by gravitational wave interferometers like ligo ii / virgo and lisa . *",
    "although the production of defects other than cosmic strings are suppressed , it is possible that the level of their production may be detectable .",
    "although hybrid inflationary models with cosmic string production after inflation can be constructed , they are just possible scenarios among many others .",
    "the difference here is that the production of cosmic strings towards the end of inflation seems inevitable in brane inflation .",
    "the detection of cosmic string signatures will fix the string scale .",
    "since the string scale is determined by the amplitude of the anisotropy in cmb , we can learn a lot about the superstring / braneworld realization of our universe from cosmological observations .",
    "the topological properties of defect formation in tachyon condensation is understood in superstring theory @xcite .",
    "suppose we have @xmath11 chan - paton bundles on one stack of d@xmath0-branes and @xmath12 chan - paton bundles on a second stack of d@xmath0-branes , which is at an angle @xmath13 with respect to the first stack .",
    "they are also separated by a distance @xmath14 in some orthogonal directions . in brane inflation",
    ", @xmath14 is essentially the inflaton .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic view of the collision of branes at a fixed angle .",
    "as these two stacks of d@xmath0-branes approach each other towards the end of the inflationary epoch , the ground state open string mode @xmath15 becomes tachyonic .",
    "open strings ending on all possible pairs of branes will give rise to a @xmath16 gauge fields , and the tachyon field @xmath15 is in the @xmath17 ( bi - fundamental ) representation of the gauge group . together with @xmath18",
    ", they form the `` superconnection '' , and the defect properties may be elegantly described by k - theory @xcite . upon collision ,",
    "the higgs mechanism takes place as @xmath15 develops a vacuum expectation value @xmath19 : @xmath20 to simplify the problem , we may take @xmath21 .",
    "the minimum of the tachyon potential corresponds to the vacuum manifold ( n ) = which is topologically equivalent to @xmath11 . in the simplest situation where the angle between the two stacks of branes is @xmath22",
    ", we have a stack of @xmath23 d@xmath0-brane and a stack of anti - d@xmath0-branes ( which have opposite rr charges ) ; so their collision results in annihilation .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking will support defects in codimension @xmath24 , classified by the homotopy groups @xmath25 ( for stable values of @xmath23 ) .",
    "these defects are simply d@xmath26-branes ( and anti - d@xmath26-branes ) inside the d@xmath0-branes . in the compactified case",
    ", the net rr - charge must be conserved .",
    "they may appear as , respectively , monopoles , cosmic strings or domain walls if 3 , 2 or 1 of the codimensions are tangent to the 3 uncompactified spatial dimensions .",
    "to be specific , let us consider d5-branes wrapping a 2-cycle , with the remaining 3 dimensions uncompactified ( spanning our observable universe ) .",
    "the collision of these d5-branes allows the formation of d@xmath27-branes . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the defects are d3-branes with all possible orientations .",
    "those that wrap around the same 2-cycles will appear as cosmic strings , while those that do not wrap the 2-cycles appear as blobs .",
    "if there are non - trivial 1-cycles inside the 2-cycles , d3-branes can wrap around that and appear as domain walls . for @xmath29 , these are the only defects . here , the cosmic strings are akin to the vortices in abelian higgs model .    for @xmath30 , d1-branes ( for @xmath31 ) will also be produced and they may appear as cosmic strings . if there are non - trivial 1-cycles inside the 2-cycles , then they may wrap around the 1-cycles and will appear as monopoles in our universe . for @xmath30",
    ", textures may also be formed topologically .",
    "imagine a string model that describes our universe today . in the early universe , our universe contains branes of all types .",
    "the higher - dimensional branes collide to produce lower - dimensional branes and branes that are present today .",
    "consider the last two branes with 3 uncompactified spatial dimensions that are not in today s string model ground state . as they approach each other , the universe is in the inflationary epoch .",
    "after inflation ends , the collision of these two branes may produce lower - dimensional branes , which appear as defects .",
    "a large density of such defects produced after inflation may destroy the nucleosynthesis or even overclose the universe ( like the old monopole problem ) .",
    "fortunately , the fact that they can be produced topologically does not necessarily imply that they will be produced cosmologically . to see what types of defects are produced towards the end of inflation ,",
    "let us assume second order phase transition ( a point we shall come back ) and estimate the production rate using the kibble mechanism . during the brane collision , the tachyon acquires the value @xmath19 .",
    "since the vacuum manifold is non - trivial , @xmath15 can take different values at different spatial point .",
    "the existence of the particle horizon implies that @xmath15 can not be correlated on scales larger than the horizon length @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hubble constant .",
    "therefore , non - trivial vacuum configurations , i.e. , defects , will be produced , with a density of order one per hubble volume .    at this time",
    ", the particle horizon size @xmath32 is given by [ hubble ] h^2 where @xmath34 gev . here",
    "@xmath35 is typically much bigger than the compactification sizes that the branes wrap around , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in figure 2 , we show schematically two ( large ) uncompactified dimensions and one small compactified dimension . as a consequence of the smallness of @xmath39 , the kibble mechanism does not happen in the compactified directions .",
    "that is , the codimensions of the defects must lie in the uncompactified dimensions . since the codimension is always even , and there are only 3 uncompactified dimensions , only the defects with codimension 2 ( @xmath28 ) , i.e. , cosmic string - like defects ,",
    "can be formed via the kibble mechanism ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "they are d@xmath40-branes wrapping the same compactified space as the original d@xmath0-branes , with one uncompactified dimension .",
    "if the d@xmath0-brane collision can produce d@xmath41-branes , their production will also be suppressed since there is less than one hubble volume in the compactified directions .",
    "this implies that the production of domain walls and monopole - like objects by the kibble mechanism are heavily suppressed , while the production of cosmic strings is not .",
    "generically , there may be closed and stretched cosmic strings , and they form some sort of a cosmic string network that evolves to the scaling solution . in ref.@xcite , it is argued that thermal production of any defect is probably negligible .",
    "if the d@xmath4-brane is the cosmic string ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , its tension is simply the cosmic string tension : = _ 1 = m_s^2/(2 g_s ) however , we expect the string coupling generically to be @xmath43 . to obtain a theory with a weakly coupled sector in the low energy effective field theory ( i.e. , the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions with weak gauge coupling constant @xmath6 )",
    ", it then seems necessary to have the brane world picture @xcite .",
    "this argument leads us to consider the d@xmath0-branes for @xmath44 , where the @xmath45 dimensions are compactified to volume @xmath46 .",
    "now the cosmic strings are d@xmath40-branes , with the @xmath45 dimensions compactified to the same volume @xmath47 . noting that a d@xmath0-brane has tension @xmath48 , the tension of such cosmic strings is = = = 2 m_s^2 where [ gsalpha ] g_s 2 , 1/25 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 while @xmath6 is small . for @xmath29 , only this type of cosmic strings",
    "are produced topologically . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the d@xmath4-branes may also be allowed topologically , but they are not produced cosmologically .",
    "so @xmath51 is quite generic .    to get an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath52",
    ", we may use the small @xmath13 case , which is argued to be the most likely inflationary scenario . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the string scale is determined by the anisotropy in cmb @xcite _ h 1.9 10 ^ -5 m_s 2 10 ^ 15 gev this gives g 10 ^ -7    note that the determination of @xmath52 is somewhat sensitive to the details of the brane inflationary scenario and the specific string model realization .",
    "it is easy for @xmath52 to vary by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "as we shall see , the observability of the cosmic string effect can be very sensitive to this uncertainty .",
    "let us estimate the range of @xmath2 within the brane inflationary scenario .",
    "for the brane - anti - brane scenario , @xmath52 determined by the cobe data is somewhat smaller .",
    "however , the force between the brane - anti - brane system is stronger than that for branes at a small angle . as a consequence ,",
    "the brane - anti - brane system will need some fine - tuning ( so they are separated far enough apart ) to give enough inflation .",
    "such fine - tuning is avoided if branes are at a small angle @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is fixed by the wrapping of the branes . allowing the various possibilities",
    ", we have 10 ^ -6 g 10 ^ -10",
    "that the kibble mechanism allows the production of cosmic string in the early universe is only a necessary condition . to see if cosmic strings are dynamically produced towards the end of inflation , we have to examine the tachyon potential more carefully .",
    "fortunately , our understanding of superstring theory and open superstring field theory allows us to address this issue .",
    "* in the full superstring theory , does the tachyon potential have the shape that yields second - order phase transition ?",
    "apriori , this is not clear .",
    "tachyon couplings to excited string states will induce higher powers of @xmath53 ( after integrating out the heavy string modes ) into the tachyon potential , resulting in a tachyon potential that depends on @xmath53 to all orders .",
    "naively , the potential can develop non - trivial shapes such that the phase transition may be first order ( or even more complicated ) .",
    "however , recent open superstring field theory analysis strongly suggests that this is not the case @xcite .",
    "that is , the superstring corrections change the smooth potential only quantitatively . *",
    "even with a smooth potential that monotonically decreases towards the minimum at @xmath19 , the evolution of @xmath15 as a function of time can have unusual behaviors , since the full superstring field theory action involves time derivatives of @xmath15 to all orders . again",
    ", as shown by sen @xcite , naive field theory properties essentially hold for the tachyon model here .",
    "this allows us to make an order of magnitude estimate of the production of cosmic strings .    to simplify the problem ,",
    "let us consider the brane - anti - brane ( @xmath22 ) case here .",
    "let the @xmath54 brane positions be ( @xmath55 matrix ) @xmath56 and the @xmath11 anti - brane positions be ( @xmath57 matrix ) @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the transverse coordinate .",
    "the matrix property of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the origin of the non - commutative geometry in string theory .",
    "the tachyon potential has the form : v ( , , t ) & = & v_l + ( m+2n ) _",
    "p + tr + & & - tr ( tt^)+ o(t^4 ) where @xmath62 is the potential due to the closed string exchange .",
    "it is essentially the inflaton potential .",
    "we shall ignore it here .",
    "also , to avoid the complication due to the non - commutative geometry , let @xmath21 and @xmath29 ; then @xmath63 is the brane - anti - brane separation in the compactified dimensions orthogonal to the branes .",
    "recall also that @xmath45 dimensions of the brane is compactified with volume @xmath47 . at @xmath64 ,",
    "when the brane is on top of the anti - brane , we have , for a single complex scalar field @xmath15 , v(t ) = 2 _ p - + ( t^t)^2 + ... where @xmath65 and the higher terms may be calculated in open superstring field theory @xcite . for our purpose , we shall truncate it to the fourth order term , but demand that the potential is zero at its minimum @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath67 .",
    "this condition fixes @xmath65 , = = 0.62 where we have used eq.([gsalpha ] ) .",
    "this resulting tachyon potential has the same shape as that obtained from open superstring field theory @xcite and should be well within a factor of 2 of the true potential for @xmath68 . for generic @xmath14 , we now have [ potty ] v(t , y ) = - ( - ) t^t + ( t^t)^2    now we would like to make an order of magnitude estimate of the initial density of cosmic strings , following an approach in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "let us introduce a length scale @xmath69 , so that the initial density is @xmath70 .",
    "the effective thickness of a cosmic string ( as a function of @xmath14 ) is simply the correlation length @xmath71 given by the inverse of the tachyon mass @xmath72 : _",
    "c(y ) = = ( - ( ) ^2)^-1/2 as @xmath15 approaches @xmath19 , a cosmic string may be locked in if the vacuum configuration is non - trivial .",
    "when @xmath15 can easily fluctuate back to zero , the vacuum configuration , and so the cosmic string , is not locked in .",
    "let @xmath73 be the largest length scale on which quantum fluctuations from @xmath19 to @xmath74 are probable ; that is , the ginsburg length @xmath73 measures the `` fuzziness '' factor .",
    "when the fuzziness is larger than the thickness of the cosmic string , i.e. , @xmath75 , the cosmic string can simply fluctuate away and disappear ; that is , it is not really formed .",
    "a cosmic string is truly formed when @xmath76 .",
    "initially , @xmath75 ; but , as @xmath14 decreases , @xmath73 decreases faster than @xmath77 , so at some @xmath14 , @xmath76 and the formation of cosmic strings is locked in .",
    "this allows us to estimate the initial cosmic string density by demanding @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "now , to estimate @xmath80 , we note that the quantum fluctuation during this epoch is close to that in desitter space , namely @xmath81 , where the hubble constant @xmath82 is given by h^2 = this allows us to define @xmath73 as given by : _",
    "g^3(y ) v_o(y ) = where @xmath83 is the height of the unstable maximum of the tachyon potential ( at @xmath74 ) taken with respect to the minimum of the potential , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "( for @xmath64 , @xmath85 ) . using the potential ( [ potty ] ) for both @xmath86 and @xmath82 , we obtain _ g^3 ( y ) _",
    "c^4 ( y ) for large lengths , @xmath87 , but @xmath88 decreases faster than @xmath89 as the branes approach each other .",
    "now the length scale @xmath69 is determined by the condition @xmath90 , giving , _",
    "s ~1.6 10 ^ 4 m_s^-1 this happens at @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , which is very close to the critical value of @xmath93 ( when @xmath15 just becomes tachyonic ) . around these values of @xmath14 ,",
    "the reheating process has yet to begin , so the temperature of the universe is essentially zero .",
    "this justifies the above approach where only quantum fluctuation is considered .",
    "also , @xmath62 is not big at @xmath91 , so it may be ignored , as we have done in the estimate . during this epoch",
    ", the branes are moving towards each other quite rapidly .",
    "the time it takes for the branes to move from @xmath94 to @xmath95 is of order @xmath96 .",
    "so both @xmath89 and @xmath88 decrease rapidly from the value @xmath69 as the branes move closer .",
    "the hubble ( or particle horizon ) size is given by eq.([hubble ] ) : h^-1 6 10 ^ 3 m_s^-1",
    "so the cosmic string density scale set by the tachyon potential and the scale set by the kibble mechanism are comparable .",
    "this initial cosmic string density ( somewhere between @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) is high enough for the cosmic string network to to evolve towards the scaling solution @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the cosmic string network after its initial production is well - studied @xcite . after the initial production of cosmic strings , they continue to interact among themselves . when two cosmic strings intersect , they reconnect or intercommute ( see figure 1 , where the diagrams are reinterpreted for cosmic strings in the uncompactified dimensions ) .",
    "when a cosmic string intersects itself , a closed string loop is broken off .",
    "such a loop will oscillate quasi - periodically and gradually lose energy by gravitational radiation .",
    "its eventual decay transfers the cosmic string energy to gravitational waves .",
    "higher initial string density brings higher interaction rate so , not surprisingly , the cosmic string network evolves towards a scaling solution . as a consequence , the physics is essentially dictated by the single parameter @xmath99 .    in this brane inflationary scenario",
    ", we see that the density perturbation ( and the cmb anisotropy ) comes from two sources : the inflaton fluctuation during inflation and the cosmic string network . here , let us get a crude estimate of the magnitude of these two components . the cobe data",
    "roughly yields @xmath100 if the scaling solution of the cosmic string network is the sole source of the density perturbation . since @xmath101",
    ", we have , in terms of the spectrum of the cmb , namely , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 the partial wave integer ) ; c_l & = & ( 1-a ) c^i_l + a c^s_l + a & & 10% where @xmath104 comes from inflation while @xmath105 comes from cosmic strings .",
    "so , with @xmath106 , the cosmic string network contributes of order 10 @xmath107 of the anisotropy in the cmb data . as shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", the present cmb data @xcite can easily accommodate up to @xmath108 20@xmath109 , so the cosmic string production towards the end of brane inflation is perfectly compatible with the present cmb data @xcite , while future data from map and planck will be able to test this scenario .",
    "it is obviously very important to estimate @xmath110 more carefully in the cosmic string network in a phenomenologically realistic superstring model .",
    "since @xmath110 is most sensitive to the string scale @xmath52 , the cmb data may be a very good way to eventually determine the value of @xmath52 .",
    "the cosmic string network also generates gravitational waves that may be observable .",
    "this has been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "the gravitational wave spectrum has an almost flat region that extends from @xmath111 hz to @xmath112 hz . within this frequency range ,",
    "both ligo ii / virgo ( sensitive at around @xmath113 hz ) and lisa ( sensitive at around @xmath114 hz ) are expected to reach the sensitivity of @xmath115 .",
    "other possible detections of cosmic strings may be pulsar timing experiments , cmb polarization measurements etc .",
    "if the cosmic string network of oscillating loops involve cusps and kinks of the cosmic strings , then strong beams of high - frequency gravitational waves are emitted by these cusps and kinks .",
    "this scenario is studied by damour and vilenkin @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the sharp bursts of gravitational waves should be easily observable .",
    "ligo ii / virgo and lisa may detect them for values down to @xmath116 .",
    "although present pulsar timing measurement is compatible with @xmath117 , a modest improvement on the accuracy can detect a network of cuspy cosmic string loops down to @xmath118 . to conclude",
    ", if cusps and kinks happen to a small but reasonable fraction of the cosmic strings , gravitational wave detection will be able to critically test the brane inflationary scenario .",
    "if detected , it will further shed light on the specific brane inflationary scenario .",
    "brane inflation is a natural realization of inflation in the brane world scenario . for the string scale close to the gut scale ( the case we are interested in ) , presumably any phenomenologically realistic string model is dual to another string model that has a brane world interpretation . in this sense ,",
    "brane inflation is generic . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is shown that the brane inflation scenario is robust , that is , the probability that the universe has an extended inflationary epoch before big bang is of order unity .",
    "this excludes the scenarios where the tachyon is the inflaton ( which may evade the production of defects , but typically the potential is far too steep for enough e - foldings ) .",
    "the bottom line is that cosmic strings will be copiously produced in any robust brane inflationary scenario .",
    "other defects , if exist topologically , may also be produced , though with suppressed rates . in conclusion",
    ", we find that brane inflation has interesting predictions beyond that of the slow - roll inflationary scenario , and provides a testing ground for superstring theory to confront experiments .",
    "existing data is perfectly compatible with brane inflation .",
    "it is exciting that future experiments will likely provide non - trivial tests of the scenario .",
    "the key is the determination of the string scale @xmath52 .",
    "the observability of the cosmic string effect in brane inflation is very sensitive to the value of @xmath52 .",
    "although we use @xmath8 gev in this paper , there is easily a factor of 2 or 3 uncertainty in its extraction from the cmb data",
    ". a more careful analysis of the cmb data in the framework of more realistic superstring models will be very important .",
