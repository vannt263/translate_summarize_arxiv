    "the intriguing possibility of circumbinary planets has been a feature of science - fiction for decades .",
    "theoretical studies of planetary formation have shown that such systems are indeed possible @xcite , and that they can be dynamically stable @xcite , but their secure detection remained quite elusive , even in this present age of accelerating exoplanetary discovery . finally , in late 2011 , the first unambiguous example of a circumbinary planet was announced by the _ kepler _",
    "science team @xcite .",
    "this discovery was quickly followed by the first multiple - planet circumbinary system , kepler-47 @xcite , and two additional circumbinary systems @xcite .",
    "these exciting results have yielded a first estimate that @xmath01% of close binary stars host such circumbinary planets .",
    "in addition to the _ kepler _ discoveries , there is a growing body of literature claiming the detection of circumbinary planets orbiting post - common - envelope host stars .",
    "such objects can , in theory , be detected by light - travel - time variations : as the postulated planetary companions orbit the central stars , they cause those stars to move back and forth as they orbit around the system s centre of mass . as a result ,",
    "the distance between the earth and the host stars varies as a function of time , meaning that the light from the stars must sometimes travel further to reach us than at other times .",
    "this effect results in measurable variations in the timing of mutual eclipse events between the two stars that can be measured from the earth .",
    "the stars proposed as hosts of circumbinary planets detected in this manner include cataclysmic variables ( e.g. uzfor , potter et al .",
    "2011 ) , pre - cataclysmic variables ( nnser , beuermann et al .",
    "2010 ) , and detached subdwarf - m dwarf ( e.g. hwvir , beuermann et al .",
    "2012 ) or subdwarf - white dwarf ( e.g. rrcae , qian et al .",
    "2012 ) binaries .",
    "@xcite provide a complete summary of the 12 proposed post - common - envelope planetary systems in their table 2 .",
    "while the profusion of circumbinary planets claimed to orbit post - common - envelope binaries would suggest that such systems are extremely common , all is not as it seems . when subjected to rigorous dynamical testing , a great many of these proposed planetary systems",
    "have been found to be simply unfeasible .",
    "that is , the orbits of the proposed planets are such that , if they were truly planets , they would rapidly experience significant and ultimately catastrophic mutual interactions ( ejections or collisions ) .",
    "recently , several of the proposed circumbinary multiple - planet systems have been tested in this manner .",
    "highly detailed dynamical maps , showing the lifetimes of a wide range of orbital configurations for the planets in question , demonstrate that a number of these candidate systems are dynamically unstable on timescales of @xmath1 yr .",
    "some proposed circumbinary systems investigated in this way include hu aqr @xcite , nn ser @xcite , and hw vir @xcite .",
    "the same dynamical mapping techniques have also been applied to multiple - planet systems discovered by radial velocity studies , in order to check their long - term stability @xcite and to assess the role of low - order resonances @xcite .",
    "nsvs14256825 ( hereafter nsvs1425 ) is an eclipsing binary consisting of a subdwarf ob star and an m dwarf orbiting one another with a period of 0.110374  days @xcite .",
    "the combination of a hot subdwarf and a late - type dwarf produces significant reflection effects in the light curves , and such systems are known as `` hw vir '' systems , of which only 10 are currently known @xcite . since its discovery in the northern sky variability survey @xcite , eclipse timings have been reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a linear period change was noted by @xcite , and @xcite reported a cyclic period change , which they attributed to the presence of a @xmath0  12  planet with an unconstrained period @xmath220 yr .",
    "most recently , @xcite presented additional eclipse timings and , by combining all available timings , fitted two periodicities which were then attributed to the influence of two unseen circumbinary planets .",
    "the reported parameters for the candidate planets are given in table  [ params ] . in this work ,",
    "we bring our well - tested dynamical mapping techniques ( section 2 ) to bear on the candidate nsvs1425  planetary system .",
    "we determine the dynamical stability of the complete @xmath3 range of orbital parameters , and we test the effect of mutual inclinations between the two planets ( section 3 ) .",
    "we discuss the results and make our conclusions in section 4 .",

    "as in our previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we used the hybrid integrator within the _",
    "n_-body dynamics package mercury @xcite to perform our integrations .",
    "we held the initial orbit of the inner planet fixed at its best - fit parameters , as reported in @xcite , and then created 126,075 test systems . in those test systems , the initial orbit of the outer planet",
    "was varied systematically in semi - major axis @xmath4 , eccentricity @xmath5 , periastron argument @xmath6 , and mean anomaly @xmath7 , resulting in a @xmath8 grid of `` clones '' spaced evenly across the 3@xmath9 range in those parameters ( as given in table  [ params ] ) .",
    "for the mean anomaly , not reported in @xcite , we simply tested the entire allowed range 0 - 360 degrees .",
    "we assumed the central stars to be a single point mass , an acceptable approximation as the binary separation is @xmath10 orbital radius of the inner planet , with @xmath11  @xcite0.074 for the central stars , @xmath12 smaller than our assumed value .",
    "this small difference would have no effect on the interactions _ between _ the planets , only on the overall _ scale _ of the system , and hence does not affect our results . ] .",
    "we assumed the planets were coplanar with each other and had masses equivalent to their minimum mass , @xmath13 .",
    "we then followed the dynamical evolution of each test system for a period of 100 million years , and recorded the times at which either of the planets was removed from the system .",
    "planets were removed if they collided with one another , hit the central body , or reached a barycentric distance of 10  au .",
    "in addition to this highly detailed `` nominal '' run , we examined the effects of mutual inclinations between the two planets by running further suites of simulations at lower resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we varied the initial orbit of the outer planet as above , resulting in a @xmath14 grid in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively ( for a total of 11,025 test systems ) .",
    "we ran five such scenarios , with the inclination between the two planets set at 5 , 15 , 45 , 135 , and 180 degrees ( the latter two corresponding to a retrograde orbit for the outer planet ) .",
    "again , the 11,025 test systems were allowed to run for 100 million years , or until the system was destabilised due to ejection or collision .",
    "figure  [ nominal ] shows the stability of the nominal orbits for the nsvs1425  system as given in @xcite .",
    "it is immedately apparent that the vast majority of the @xmath15 parameter space is extremely unstable , with mean lifetimes of less than 1000 yrs .",
    "this result is not particularly surprising , given that the great majority of solutions tested place the two planets on mutually crossing orbits - meaning that close encounters between the two are a certainty .",
    "the nominal best - fit orbit of the outer planet does fall in a narrow strip of increased stability , featuring mean lifetimes @xmath16yr .",
    "however , as the subdwarf b host star has evolved well off the main sequence , one would expect the system to be considerably older than this mean lifetime .",
    "while the ages of subdwarf b stars are highly uncertain @xcite , even an a - type progenitor would make the system @xmath00.5 gyr old .",
    "population - synthesis models of the close binary progenitors of these post - common - envelope systems show that the initial mass distribution of primary stars that result in subdwarf b stars ranges from 1.0 - 1.8 .",
    "the shortest - lived ( i.e. highest - mass ) progenitors would then evolve off the main sequence in @xmath17 yr .",
    "hence , any planets which existed before the common - envelope stage would be expected to demonstrate dynamical stability on a timescale far longer than that exhibited by the nsvs1425  system .",
    "the observed strip of moderate stability is attributed to the protective influence of the mutual 2:1 mean - motion resonance between the two proposed planets .",
    "such resonant protection is well known , both in our own solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in exoplanetary science ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained for the proposed planets around hu  aqr ( e.g. figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both cases ,",
    "the proposed outer planet lies on a highly eccentric best - fit orbit ( @xmath18 ) that crosses that of the innermost planet and the two planets are close to mutual 2:1 mean - motion resonance .",
    "additionally , the proposed system proves to be dynamically unstable on typical timescales of hundreds or thousands of years .    , and",
    "eccentricity , @xmath5 , of the outer planet .",
    "the mean lifetime of the planetary system ( in @xmath19 ( lifetime / yr ) ) at a given @xmath20 co - ordinate is denoted by the colour of the plot .",
    "the lifetime at each @xmath20 location is the mean value of 75 separate integrations carried out on orbits at that @xmath20 position ( testing a combination of 15 unique @xmath6 values , and 5 unique @xmath7 values ) .",
    "the nominal best - fit orbit for the outer planet is shown as the small red square with @xmath21-@xmath9 error bars . ]",
    "we then considered the possibility of non - zero mutual inclinations between the two candidate planets in the nsvs1425  system . for a significantly interacting planetary system",
    ", retrograde orbits can provide a dynamically stable configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to explore the dynamical stability of systems resulting from such non - coplanar scenarios",
    ", we performed a second suite of simulations at lower resolution , as described in section 2 .",
    "the results of the five mutually - inclined scenarios are shown in figure  [ inclined ] , along with the nominal coplanar scenario from figure  [ nominal ] .",
    "we see that mutually - inclined scenarios are even more unstable than the coplanar scenario . even for the 180-degree configuration ( i.e. retrograde and coplanar , panel f )",
    ", the only region of stability appears in the lower right , at the lowest eccentricities and largest semi - major axis for the outer planet . as was the case for hu aquarii @xcite , the highly stable region",
    "is restricted to orbits which have periastron distances several hill radii from the inner planet . however",
    ", this region lies well beyond the 1@xmath9 uncertainties of the orbits derived by @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the two circumbinary planets proposed by @xcite are dynamically unfeasible in virtually any configuration within @xmath22 of their derived orbital parameters . based on our results , a mechanism other than , or in addition to , one ( or more ) planets is needed to explain the observed period variations .",
    "@xcite note that about 90% of eclipsing post - common - envelope binaries are reported to have timing variations , nearly all of which have been attributed to one or more orbiting circumbinary planets . both avenues to such planetary systems  survival of the planets through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula phase , or secondary accretion from the ejected envelope of the primary star  are possible but highly uncertain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite examined the formation and observational statistics of circumbinary planets in order to investigate the puzzling trend that fully 90% of post - common - envelope eclipsing binaries appear to host planets .",
    "they note that observations of disk - bearing pre - main - sequence stars @xcite indicate that the circumbinary disk lifetime is too short ( @xmath231 myr ) to form giant planets by core accretion .",
    "observational results from _ kepler _ also point to a main - sequence circumbinary giant planet frequency of @xmath01% @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the frequency of giant planets in 3 - 6 au orbits to be no more than 37% , based on data on single main - sequence stars from the anglo - australian planet search .",
    "all of these strands of evidence led @xcite to the conclusion that `` virtually all close - compact binaries ... are unlikely to be explained by first - generation planets . ''",
    "another potential solution to the near - ubiquitous presence of planets around evolved binaries is the formation of these companions in the post main sequence circumstellar envelope produced by the subdwarf ob progenitor as it evolves through its agb phase .",
    "the amount of material cast off by an agb star ( up to 70% of the stellar mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is comparable to that of the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite and the lifetime of the agb phase is similar to that of gas - rich protoplanetary discs within which first generation planet formation occurs @xcite , lending plausibility to the idea of a second generation of planet formation .",
    "however , this second generation planet formation scenario is highly speculative and requires further scrutiny ( and detailed modelling ) before it can be considered a viable answer @xcite .    as was the case in earlier studies of proposed circumbinary planets in highly evolved systems ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the planetary system proposed in the evolved binary system nsvs14256825 is simply not dynamically feasible .",
    "our results suggest that some mechanism other than planets must be responsible for the observed eclipse - timing variations , and once again highlight the critical importance of performing detailed dynamical analyses of potential new planetary systems in order to determine whether the proposed systems make sense .",
