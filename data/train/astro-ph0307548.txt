    "a major advance in this topic in recent years has been the determination of the black hole to bulge mass relation ( cf fig .",
    "1 ; this will be called in the following bbr ; magorrian et al 1998 , gebhardt et al 2000 , merritt & ferrarese 2001 , shields et al 2003 ) . the determination of the bbr has been made by various methods : 1 .",
    "stellar proper motions for the galactic center bh ( schdel et al . 2003 , ghez et al . 2003 ) , 2 .",
    "stellar absorption lines , to obtain the stellar kinematics , 3 .",
    "ionised gas emission lines ( less reliable , since affected by outflows , inflows ) , and also masing gas emission lines , 4 .",
    "reverberation mapping , exploiting time delays between variations of agn continuum , and broad line emission , giving the size of the emitting gas region , combined with the gas doppler velocity to give the virial mass ( peterson & wandel , 2000 ) 5 .",
    "ionization models : method based on the correlation between quasar luminosity and the size of the broad line region ( blr , rokaki et al 1992 ) .",
    "some progress has also been made in the search of intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) , for example in the globular clusters m15 in our galaxy and g1 in m31 : in m15 , the mass of the central object is lower than 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 and could be stellar remnants ( van der marel 2003 ) , while in g1 , a bh of 2 10@xmath2 m@xmath1 is identified , and obeys the bbr ( gebhardt et al 2002 ) .",
    "inside the effective radius of the bulge .",
    "filled circles indicate bh mass measurement from stellar dynamics , squares from ionized gas , triangles on maser lines , crosses are from reverberation mapping , and `` plus signs '' from ionization models ( from kormendy & gebhardt 2001).,width=340 ]    the demography of smbh is now much better known .",
    "it was already suspected that agn were active during a short duty cycle of @xmath3 4 10@xmath4 yr , and that many galaxies today should host a starving black hole ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ) .",
    "the observed bbr now strongly constrains the duty cycle time - scale .",
    "also the cosmic background radiation detected at many wavelengths constrains the formation history .",
    "the volumic density of massive black holes today is derived , from the observed density of bulges , and the proportionality factor m@xmath5 = 0.002 m@xmath6 ( bbr ) . and",
    "independently , the light that should have been radiated at the formation of these bhs can be computed , redshifted and compared to the observed cosmic background radiation : in the optical , we see only 10% of the expected flux , but 30% in x - rays , and 80% in the infra - red .",
    "the accretion radiation does not get out in optical light , probably due to the extinction .",
    "since agn are observed early in the universe , with powerful emission , indicating very high bh masses ( higher at z=3 than today ) , their growth time - scale is a problem .    *",
    "2.1 quantifying the problem * + to have an order of magnitude , and simple dimensional relations , let us assume spherical accretion , from an accretion radius r@xmath7 = 0.3 m@xmath8/v@xmath9 pc , where m@xmath8 is the mass of the bh in 10@xmath10 m@xmath1 , and v@xmath11 the velocity in 100km / s ( corresponding to the effective stellar velocity inside the galaxy nucleus , related to the bulge mass ) .",
    "the canonical bondi accretion rate is then : dm / dt = 4 @xmath12 r@xmath13 v @xmath14 = 10@xmath15 m@xmath1/yr m@xmath16/v@xmath17 @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the local density in m@xmath1/pc@xmath0 .    since dm / dt @xmath18 m@xmath13 ,",
    "then the accretion time is @xmath18 1/m , t@xmath7 @xmath3 10@xmath19 yr / m@xmath8 v@xmath17/@xmath14 ; for very low mass bh , this takes much larger than the hubble time .",
    "therefore the formation of smbh requires a large seed , mergers of bh , or very large densities , like in the milky way nucleus , 10@xmath4 m@xmath1/pc@xmath0 .",
    "if these conditions are fulfilled , the growth of massive bh can then be accretion - dominated , i.e. t@xmath20 = t@xmath7 .",
    "this phase could correspond to moderate agn , like seyferts , and the luminosity is increasing as l @xmath18 dm / dt @xmath18 m@xmath13 . at some point , the luminosity will reach the eddington luminosity , since l@xmath21 m. the eddington ratio increases as l / l@xmath21 m , the bh growth slows down when approching l@xmath22 , corresponding to a qso phase .",
    "the time - scale of this powerful agn phase is t@xmath22 = m/(dm / dt)@xmath22 = 4.5 10@xmath4 yr ( 0.1/@xmath23 ) ( where @xmath23 is the usual radiation efficiency ) . equating t@xmath7 = t@xmath22 ,",
    "this occurs for m = 2 10@xmath24 m@xmath1 v@xmath17/@xmath14 ( @xmath23/0.1 ) .",
    "wang et al . ( 2000 ) propose that tidal perturbations help to grow a smbh from a small seed , by boosting the accretion , and then lead to the bbr .",
    "* 2.2 are the bh the first objects to form ? * + one solution to the bh growth problem would be that massive bh form very early at high redshift , as the remnants of pop iii stars .",
    "fragmentation must be inefficient , and the first stars could reach @xmath3 300m@xmath1 , since radiative losses are negligible at zero metallicity . above 260 m@xmath1 , the objects could collapse to a bh directly ( madau & rees 2001 , schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) . in almost all mini - haloes ,",
    "10@xmath25 m@xmath1 imbh could be formed , by the merging of these seeds .",
    "* 2.3 do imbh exist ? * +",
    "some evidence for the existence of imbh would be welcome , to support theories . however , their observation is very difficult , both by the kinematics , since their gravitational influence is small , and from their possible agn activity , since the expected luminosity is weak .",
    "according to the extrapolation of bbr , these imbh should be searched as agn in dwarf galaxies : a good candidate is ngc 4395 ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) , where the bh mass is likely to be 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath25 m@xmath1 ( radiating much below the eddington limit ) .",
    "the problem of this search is that dwarf galaxies frequently host nuclear star clusters of @xmath3 10@xmath10 m@xmath1 , hiding the weak agn .",
    "they are best observed in the local group ; a famous example , m33 , does not host any bh more massive than 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 , which is already 10 times below the value expected from the bbr .    * 2.4 double bh in the milky - way nucleus * + evidence for an imbh could come from the milky way nucleus : hansen & milosavljevic ( 2003 ) propose its existence to explain the observation of bright stars orbiting within 0.1pc , which are are young massive main - sequence stars , in spite of an environment hostile to star - formation .",
    "aternative solutions could be star mergers , or exotic objects ( ghez et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the imbh scenario , stars were formed in a star cluster outside the central pc , and then dragged in by a bh of 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath2 m@xmath1 .",
    "the decay time - scale by dynamical friction for normal stars is too large ( much longer than the massive stars life - time ) , but for the imbh , this time - scale is 1 - 10 myr .",
    "stars may be dragged inwards even after the star cluster has been disrupted .",
    "such a system smbh - imbh and a gas disk may reveal interesting dynamics ; it is similar to a protosolar system , with the sun - jupiter couple , resonant effects like planetary migration are expected ( gould & rix 2000 ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to account for the bbr , all involving a simultaneous formation of bulges and smbh , and constraining the feedback processes .    *",
    "3.1 feedback due to qso outflows * + qso and stars main cosmic formation epoch coincide ( e.g. shaver et al .",
    "1996 ) . their common formation could be regulated by each other , and the qso outflows prevent star formation ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "the condition for the wind to be powerful enough to give escape velocity to the gas constrains the bh mass to m@xmath5 @xmath18 @xmath26 , which from the faber - jackson relation , gives m@xmath5 @xmath18 m@xmath6 .",
    "but the phenomenon is assumed spherical , in reality jets are collimated , the gas is clumpy , and compressed to form stars .",
    "* 3.2 sinking of super star clusters ( ssc ) * + sinking of ssc in a dark halo has been proposed to form bulges ( fu et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the merging of small bh associated to clusters would provide a mass ratio m@xmath5/m@xmath6 = 10@xmath15 only , slightly below what is observed .",
    "* 3.3 radiation drag * + bulge stars can drive accretion by radiation drag on the ism , in extracting angular momentum ( umemura 2001 ) .",
    "the m@xmath5/m@xmath6 is then an universal constant depending only on the energy conversion efficiency for nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium .",
    "the efficiency falls as 1/@xmath27 , with @xmath28 the optical depth of the gas . but",
    "star formation occurs in a clumpy medium .",
    "today this mechanism is inefficient , since elliptical galaxies and bulges have no gas .",
    "* 3.4 hierarchical models of galaxy formation * + hierarchical models explain very well the bbr ( haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ) .",
    "the scatter is due to : 1. m@xmath29 of the bulge progenitor depends on @xmath30 , but not on the formation epoch of the bulge , while m@xmath31 depends on both ; 2. mergers move the galaxies on the m@xmath5- @xmath30 relation , even at the end , when there is only bh mergers ( and not enough gas left to grow the bh ) .",
    "the gas fraction in galaxies falls from 75% at z=3 to 10% at z=0 .",
    "the gas fraction in major mergers is higher in fainter spheroids that form at high z , which are more concentrated .",
    "elliptical / spheroids forming recently have smaller bh .",
    "typically a seed bh of 10@xmath10 m@xmath1 forms at 5 @xmath32 z @xmath32 10 and then gas is accreted . for a typical smbh , about 30 bh are merged .",
    "today big elliptical s bh accrete only by merging with small bh , but in the past , gas accretion was dominant .    * 3.5 bar torques * + bars concentrate mass towards the center , and are able to form bulges and fuel a central bh ( e.g. review in combes 2001 ) .",
    "bars are also self - regulated : as soon as 5% of the galaxy mass is concentrated in the nuclear region , the bar is destroyed ( in 2 - 5 gyr ) . the amplitude of the torque is confirmed by observations .",
    "however , to explain the high frequency of bars today , galaxies have to accrete external gas , leading to bar renewal ( bournaud & combes 2002 , block et al",
    ". 2002 ) .",
    "a galaxy is in continuous evolution , and accretes mass all along its life .",
    "several bar episodes can process in a hubble time ( cf fig .",
    "2 ) . at each bar episode , both bulge and bh grow in a similar manner , which explains the bbr .",
    "the presence of smbh in every spheroids , and the existence of the bbr , may explain the observe dichotomy between massive and small ellipticals : 1. cusps ( steep power - law in stellar central density profile ) are characteristic of low - mass ellipticals , with disky isophotes and weak rotation ; 2.cores ( flat central density profile ) are found in high - mass galaxies , with boxy isophotes and no rotation .",
    "adiabatic growth of a black hole , from gas accretion , and destruction of nearby stars , produces a cusp ( cipollina & bertin 1994 ) .",
    "however galaxy mergers , leading to binary black - holes , and heating of the central stellar system , are able to produce the observed cores ( ebisuzaki et al 1991 , milosavljevic & merritt ( 2001 ) .",
    "the expected blue luminosity of agn , corresponding to the bh growth and to the bbr , is too large compared to observations , and models have tried to lower the radiating efficiency ( adaf , cdaf , adios , extinction ) . the expected number of binary bhs from the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation is not observed , and mechanisms to merge them more efficiently have to be found .",
    "more questions remain , as why are the disks so irrelevant in the bbr , or whether the bbr is already established at high z. the existence of imbh has to be proven , and the threshold for the bh seeds to be precised .",
    "exceptions to the bbr , like m33 , have to be searched and understood .",
