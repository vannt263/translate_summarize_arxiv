    "realizing chiral symmetry on the lattice is a problem with a long history . in 1975",
    "wilson decided to break chiral symmetry explicitly in order to remove the unwanted doubler fermions @xcite . as a result ,",
    "recovering chiral symmetry with wilson fermions requires fine - tuning as well as taking the continuum limit . in 1981",
    "it was proved by nielsen and ninomiya @xcite and in a different way by friedan @xcite that removing the doubler fermions while maintaining locality is possible only if one explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry of the continuum theory . in 1992 , using a wilson term in 4 + 1 dimensions , kaplan constructed domain wall fermions in order to realize chiral symmetry on the lattice @xcite . at the end of the same year",
    ", narayanan and neuberger introduced the related overlap formulation of chiral lattice fermions @xcite . already in 1982",
    "ginsparg and wilson @xcite had discussed how to maintain a remnant of chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "this paper was rediscovered by hasenfratz in 1997 in relation to the perfect action approach to qcd @xcite .",
    "in particular , perfect lattice fermions obey the by now well - known ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "it was immediately realized by neuberger that the same is true for overlap fermions @xcite . in 1998",
    "lscher showed that lattice fermion actions that obey the ginsparg - wilson relation realize a new version of chiral symmetry that is natural for theories on the lattice and coincides with the usual one in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "this development culminated in the non - perturbative construction of chiral lattice gauge theories @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider another aspect of lattice chiral symmetry , namely how it can be realized nonlinearly .",
    "nonlinear realizations of symmetries are well understood in the continuum in the context of low - energy effective theories describing spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "goldstone s theorem tells us that the spontaneous breakdown of a continuous global symmetry @xmath0 to an unbroken subgroup @xmath1 implies the presence of massless particles : the number of goldstone boson fields is given by the difference between the number of generators of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry group @xmath2 of qcd with @xmath3 massless quark flavors is spontaneously broken to the vector subgroup @xmath4 .",
    "hence there are @xmath5 massless goldstone bosons : the three pions for @xmath6 and , in addition , the four kaons , and the @xmath7-meson for @xmath8 . the theoretical framework for describing goldstone bosons with effective fields",
    "was developed by weinberg @xcite and by coleman , wess , and zumino @xcite , partly in collaboration with callan @xcite . as a result",
    ", goldstone bosons are described by fields in the coset space @xmath9 and the group @xmath0 is nonlinearly realized on those fields . in qcd the pions , the kaons , and the @xmath7-meson",
    "are accordingly described by matrix valued fields in the coset space @xmath10 = su(n_f)$ ] .",
    "notably , the pion effective theory developed by weinberg @xcite has a systematic low - energy expansion in gasser and leutwyler s framework of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "when matter fields are included in the effective theory of goldstone bosons , they also transform nonlinearly under chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "in particular , the global symmetry @xmath0 is hidden in a locally realized symmetry @xmath1 with a corresponding `` gauge '' field that is constructed from the goldstone boson field .",
    "it must be pointed out that there is no true gauge symmetry @xmath1 , just the global symmetry @xmath0 . exploiting a nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry , gasser , sainio , and svarc incorporated a single nucleon in chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "systematic power counting schemes for non - relativistic heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory were developed by jenkins and manohar @xcite and by bernard , kaiser , kambor , and meissner @xcite . a more economical scheme that maintains explicit lorentz invariance was introduced by becher and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "one may ask why one would want to put low - energy effective theories on the lattice .",
    "indeed , many questions that arise in the framework of low - energy lagrangians can be solved analytically using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "usually , such calculations are performed in the continuum using dimensional regularization .",
    "it is certainly more tedious to work with the lattice regularization in chiral perturbation theory calculations .",
    "still , in order to address conceptual problems , for example , related to power divergences , the lattice has already been used in magnon @xcite , pion @xcite , as well as heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in the context of lattice qcd ,",
    "effective field theories provide powerful tools to keep systematic errors under control @xcite .",
    "moreover , chiral lagrangians on the lattice have been investigated in order to facilitate the lattice determination of the gasser - leutwyler coefficients @xcite .",
    "although interesting , this is not the main motivation for the present work .",
    "we formulate lattice theories with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry in order to address non - perturbative questions that arise in the context of low - energy effective theories .",
    "it is perhaps not obvious that such problems even exist .",
    "an example of a non - perturbative problem in the context of chiral lagrangians concerns the rotor spectrum of massless qcd in a finite box .",
    "however , this problem reduces to one in quantum mechanics and has been solved analytically by leutwyler @xcite without any need for a lattice .",
    "few - nucleon systems have been treated with effective field theory methods in nuclear physics .",
    "for example , the two - nucleon system was studied by kaplan , savage , and wise @xcite and the three - nucleon system was investigated by bedaque , hammer , and van kolck @xcite .",
    "again , the solution of these problems required non - perturbative techniques but not yet a lattice . going to larger nuclei and eventually to",
    "nuclear matter is a non - trivial task that requires to solve more complicated non - perturbative problems in the effective theory @xcite . here",
    "the lattice provides a natural framework in which such questions can be addressed on a solid theoretical basis .",
    "a central observation of this paper is that the nielsen - ninomiya theorem is naturally avoided when chiral symmetry is nonlinearly realized on the lattice .",
    "in fact , constituent quark masses do not break a nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry .",
    "similarly , the wilson term  introduced in order to remove the doubler fermions  does no longer break chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "hence , exact chiral symmetry is naturally maintained using a simple wilson action while the fermion doubling problem is still solved .",
    "this raises the question how anomalies manifest themselves in this context .",
    "remarkably , in effective theories with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry , both in the continuum and on the lattice , the fermion fields do not contribute to anomalies .",
    "instead anomalies must be added by hand in the form of wess - zumino - witten @xcite and goldstone - wilczek @xcite terms .",
    "constructing these terms on the lattice while maintaining their topological features is a non - trivial problem which we do not address in this paper . in this respect ,",
    "our construction of lattice theories with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry is still incomplete .",
    "consequently , we limit ourselves to applications where anomalies play no major role . such applications concern , for example , models of static baryons interacting with pions at non - zero chemical potential and the chiral quark model of georgi and manohar @xcite .",
    "dynamical fermion simulations in a lattice theory with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry may be substantially easier than with the usual linear realization . using the nonlinear realization , even in the chiral limit ,",
    "the fermion mass is large due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , the simulated dynamical fermions should behave algorithmically like heavy wilson fermions while still maintaining manifest chiral symmetry . using a linear realization of chiral symmetry on the quark fields , explicit auxiliary pion fields",
    "have already been explored in order to simplify qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that , in general , lattice theories with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry have a potential sign problem similar to the one that arises for a single flavor of wilson fermions .",
    "fortunately , this sign problem is a lattice artifact which should disappear in the continuum limit , in particular , for sufficiently heavy fermions .",
    "recently , without directly addressing the potential sign problem , dynamical fermion algorithms have been developed for an odd number of flavors of wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "we expect that similar methods are applicable to lattice fermions with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry .",
    "still , it should be pointed out that the feasibility of dynamical fermion simulations depends crucially on the severity of the sign problem , which should be investigated in numerical simulations .",
    "we also need to mention that additional complex action problems arise if pseudo - vector fermion couplings or wess - zumino - witten and goldstone - wilczek terms are included . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the theoretical formulation of lattice theories with a nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry , while results of numerical simulations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "interestingly , the lattice construction presented here enables us to simulate massless pions interacting with static baryons even at non - zero baryon chemical potential @xmath11 and finite temperature @xmath12 , both for two and for three flavors .",
    "in contrast to full qcd , in the static baryon model this is possible without encountering a complex action problem .",
    "although questions involving high temperatures or high baryon densities are beyond the applicability of a systematic low - energy expansion , this model can still be used to answer questions concerning the universal features of the critical endpoint of the chiral phase transition line in the @xmath13-plane . although one should not expect to obtain precise information on non - universal features of qcd , such as the location of the critical endpoint",
    ", one may learn at least semi - quantitatively how the location of the endpoint changes as a function of the strange quark mass .",
    "in addition , one will gain experience with numerical methods for locating the critical endpoint in a model that has the same global symmetry properties as full qcd but is much simpler to simulate .",
    "a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry was also used by georgi and manohar in the construction of their chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "this model contains massive constituent quarks interacting with pions and gluons .",
    "while gluons are flavor singlets , both constituent quarks and pions transform non - trivially under the nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry .",
    "if this model provides an appropriate low - energy description for qcd , one could understand why the non - relativistic quark model works .",
    "however , the confinement of constituent quarks is a non - perturbative issue that can not be addressed quantitatively in the continuum formulation of the model . in this paper",
    "we present a lattice construction of the georgi - manohar model with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry . this non - perturbative framework will allow one to decide quantitatively if the georgi - manohar model can explain the success of the non - relativistic quark model .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry",
    "is reviewed in the continuum , while section 3 contains the corresponding construction on the lattice . in both cases",
    "the relevant symmetries are discussed in detail .",
    "in particular , effective lattice theories for pions and baryons are considered and the issue of fermion doubling is discussed . in section 4",
    "we discuss how low - energy effective theories can be treated non - perturbatively on the lattice and how continuum results can be extracted .",
    "section 5 explains how theories with static baryons can be simulated at non - zero chemical potential without encountering a complex action problem . in section 6",
    "we discuss the lattice version of the georgi - manohar model and propose numerical simulations in order to decide if it indeed provides a satisfactory explanation for the success of the non - relativistic quark model .",
    "section 7 discusses the possible form of the phase diagram of the lattice chiral quark model and the relation of this model to wilson s standard lattice qcd .",
    "finally , section 8 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review how theories with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry are formulated in the continuum . the fields used in this construction",
    "are introduced with emphasis on their behavior under chiral symmetry transformations , charge conjugation , and parity .",
    "simple examples of low - energy effective theories with nonlinearly realized chiral symmetry are given and manifestations of anomalies are being discussed .    consider the chiral symmetry group @xmath14 of qcd involving @xmath3 quark flavors which breaks spontaneously to the subgroup @xmath15 . following @xcite the goldstone boson field",
    "is then given by @xmath16 \\in g / h = su(n_f)$ ] .",
    "here @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the pion decay constant . under global chiral rotations",
    "@xmath19 , this field transforms as @xmath20 from the goldstone boson field one derives a field @xmath21 as @xmath22 in order to avoid ambiguities in taking the square - root , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , the field @xmath23 is diagonalized by a unitary transformation @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a diagonal matrix of complex phases @xmath27,\\exp[i \\varphi_2(x ) ] , ... , \\exp[i \\varphi_{n_f}(x)]\\}.\\ ] ] at this point , the phases @xmath28 are defined only modulo @xmath29 . in order to fix this ambiguity",
    ", we demand that @xmath30 this uniquely fixes the phases of the eigenvalues and defines the matrix @xmath26 up to an irrelevant permutation of its diagonal elements .",
    "we then define @xmath31,\\exp[i \\varphi_2(x)/2 ] , ... , \\exp[i \\varphi_{n_f}(x)/2]\\},\\ ] ] and we obtain @xmath32 when the eigenvalues of @xmath23 are non - degenerate , the matrix @xmath33 is uniquely defined in this way and is located in the middle of the shortest geodesic connecting @xmath23 with the unit - matrix @xmath34 in the group manifold of @xmath35 . on the other hand , if two eigenvalues are degenerate , the corresponding eigenvectors are not uniquely defined . if , in addition , the corresponding phases @xmath36 and @xmath37 differ by @xmath29 , this ambiguity gives rise to a coordinate singularity in the definition of @xmath33 . in the @xmath6 case , the singularities arise for @xmath38 , which corresponds to a single point in the @xmath39 group manifold . for general",
    "@xmath3 , the submanifold of @xmath35 matrices with two degenerate eigenvalues ( and with @xmath40 ) has dimension @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the codimension of the singular submanifold is @xmath42 for all @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , in a 4-dimensional space - time the singularities in @xmath33 are located on 1-dimensional lines . if one chooses the vacuum as @xmath43 , the singularities represent the world - lines of skyrmion centers .",
    "however , it should be noted that the location of the singularities varies under those chiral rotations that do not leave the vacuum invariant .",
    "still , the effective actions that we will construct with @xmath33 are completely chirally invariant , even in the presence of skyrmions or other large - field configurations .    under chiral rotations the field @xmath33 transforms as @xmath44",
    "the matrix @xmath45 depends on @xmath46 and @xmath47 as well as on the field @xmath23 and can be written as @xmath48^{1/2 } [ u(x)^{1/2}]^\\dagger = l[l^\\dagger r u(x)^\\dagger]^{1/2 } u(x)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] for transformations in the unbroken vector subgroup @xmath49 , @xmath50 , the field @xmath45 reduces to the global flavor transformation @xmath51 .",
    "the local transformation @xmath45 is a nonlinear representation of chiral symmetry .",
    "for two subsequent chiral transformations with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one has @xmath54^{1/2 } [ u(x)^{1/2}]^\\dagger , \\",

    "this is what happens in the chiral quark model of georgi and manohar @xcite ( see section 6 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that  due to the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry  the fermion mass term is chirally invariant .",
    "this makes sense because the mass @xmath79 arises from the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry even in the chiral limit , i.e. when the current quarks are massless .",
    "in fact , the term that contains the matrix @xmath83 of current quark masses is the only source of explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the leading terms of the effective theory .",

    "our lattice formulation provides a framework in which future numerical studies of this kind can be performed on a solid theoretical basis .",
    "even if one leaves the framework of a systematic low - energy expansion , the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry on the lattice may provide insight into interesting physical questions .",
