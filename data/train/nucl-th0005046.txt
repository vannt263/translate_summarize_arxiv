    ", the study of the @xmath0 width in a nuclear medium is a very interesting question since it should offer information on the renormalization of the kaon properties in a medium , a subject itself which attracts much interest @xcite and which is related to the possible existence of kaon condensates in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the many body problem of the interaction of the @xmath2 with a nuclear medium is a subtle one .",

    "@xcite is equivalent to the gauge vector one but makes the chiral counting easier . yet , in the present problem one needs lagrangians for the coupling of the mesons to baryons which are available in the vector representation but not in the tensor one and hence we shall adhere to the vector representation as done in refs .",

    "the latter channel is ozi forbidden and in spite of the large phase space only accounts for 15% of the total width .",

    "not surprisingly , the resonance is closely tied to the interaction of the @xmath10 system with related channels and is generated within unitary coupled - channel schemes @xcite .",
    "an important step forward has been given with the use of chiral lagrangians within a coupled channel unitary approach @xcite , by means of which one is able to reproduce the @xmath11 resonance and the cross sections for @xmath48 scattering to the different coupled channels .",

    "the p - wave part becomes relevant when we pick up the @xmath56 excitation , in which case there is plenty of phase space available and the momenta involved are large . in this case , however , the @xmath2 is far off shell and an additional particle - hole insertion in the @xmath8 selfenergy , i.e. a higher order in the density , does not modify much the @xmath8 propagator .",
    "the use of the technique explained above simplifies the analytical structure of the integrand of the @xmath0 selfenergy and allows one to use the same formalism that leads to eq .",

    "these correspond to the reactions @xmath104 .",
    "we can see that the largest contribution corresponds to the @xmath105 excitation , as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , since it has a larger phase space and in addition the @xmath106 coupling involves the @xmath107 combination , while the @xmath108 one involves the @xmath109 combination , which is about a factor four smaller .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath54 is comparatively larger than the @xmath110 one , due to the larger coupling , but still smaller than that of the @xmath111 due to the reduced phase space .    finally , the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phifig3 ] shows the results obtained when the vertex corrections are also incorporated .",

    "all the different decay channels contributing to the final width increase smoothly with energy as a consequence of the increasingly larger available phase space .",
    "although not shown in the figure , the effect of the relativistic recoil corrections ( factors @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfkap ] ) ) amounts to a reduction of about 5 mev , also at the @xmath0 mass .",
    "if the dipole form factor is omitted the @xmath0 width raises to about 30 mev .",
    "if , on the other hand , one uses a monopole factor of the type @xmath115 , with @xmath116 gev , as commonly used in phenomenological studies of the hyperon - nucleon interaction , the @xmath0 width turns out to be around 26 mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phifig4 ] we show the total width of the @xmath0 as a function of the @xmath0 energy for three different densities .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the medium effects are not proportional to the density .",
    "the observed density dependence also differs for the different energies of the @xmath0 .",
    "we have checked that this highly nonlinear density behavior of the width comes mainly from the s - wave part of the @xmath2 selfenergy , as already noted in ref .  @xcite . at @xmath113",
    "this s - wave contribution to the width is reduced by a factor 2.5 with respect to a linear extrapolation from low densities .",
    "the p - wave contribution is more moderately density dependent , but there is still a reduction of about 30% at @xmath113 with respect to the linear extrapolation from low densities , as also estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we take into account the full density dependence of the p - wave contribution , which in refs .",
    "@xcite was only considered at the lowest order in the density .",
    "the analysis done here about the density dependence and the p - wave contributions can be used to support the arguments given at the end of sect .",
    "2 justifying the use of the prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex ] ) to incorporate the p - wave vertex corrections .",
    "we have carried out a different calculation in which @xmath117 is substituted in the @xmath0 vertices by the term on the right in expression ( [ eq : vertex ] ) divided by @xmath118 .",
    "this new prescription is equivalent to the one used before in the case of just one particle - hole excitation in the p - wave part ( it should not be used for the s - wave part where there are no vertex corrections ) .",
    "however , this new prescription does not modify the p - wave selfenergy at higher orders in the density , a feature we would like to have in our calculation .",
    "the differences between the two prescriptions are of the order of 2% at @xmath113 , which gives us an idea of the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "= 10 cm    the width obtained in the present work is about a factor of two smaller than that obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . had we used @xmath119 the width would have raised only up to 25 mev .",
    "one might think that the differences with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite should be attributed to the fact that the latter work relied on a @xmath2 selfenergy that was not selfconsistently evaluated @xcite .",
    "their in - medium @xmath50 amplitude included basically the pauli - blocking effects on the nucleons in the intermediate @xmath50 loops .",
    "as a result , the @xmath8 strength at @xmath120 presents a quite narrow peak @xcite , located 100 mev below the kaon mass .",
    "in contrast , when the attractive and complex @xmath2 selfenergy is incorporated selfconsistently in the in - medium scattering equation , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite , the peak of the @xmath2 spectral function moves to energies closer to the free @xmath2 mass , which should result in a drastic reduction of the @xmath0 width .",
    "however , when we use the @xmath8 selfenergy which only incorporates the pauli - blocking medium effects , an approximation which is also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the width is only 7% larger than that obtained using the selfconsistent @xmath8 dressing .",
    "the reason is that the extra widening of the selfconsistent @xmath8 spectral function weakens the reduction caused by the larger mass of the @xmath2 in the medium .",
    "another factor which contributes to obtaining a smaller result than that found in refs .",
    "@xcite is the inclusion in the present work of the p - wave @xmath2 selfenergy to all orders in the @xmath2 propagator , while only the lowest order term in the density was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the tests done in this section give us an idea of the theoretical uncertainties of the present model , which we can estimate in a band between @xmath121 mev for the @xmath0 width at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "yet , when these numbers are compared with the free width of 4.4 mev , the important message , shared with ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the width of the @xmath0 is appreciably enhanced in nuclei by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "finally , the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0 propagator , normalized such that the later gives the @xmath0 spectral function , are shown in fig .  [ fig : phifig5 ] as functions of the @xmath0 energy for three different densities . the mass of the @xmath0 meson in the medium has been taken to be the same as the free one , an assumption that relies upon the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where only a small change of about 1% was found .",
    "the novel elements introduced here in the kaon spectral function should not change this result qualitatively .",
    "the @xmath0 spectral function shown in the lower pannel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phifig5 ] gives us an idea of what one might expect for , let us say , the invariant mass of @xmath3 distributions in nuclei around the @xmath0 mass in @xmath0 production experiments , like @xmath122-nucleus or @xmath123-nucleus collisions .",
    "these reactions could be easily done in experimental facilities like spring8/osaka or gsi , where programs to produce @xmath0 mesons in the elementary reactions are already considered .",
    "certainly , the results obtained here , extrapolated if needed at higher densities , should also be of much use in analyses of dilepton production in heavy ion collisions around the @xmath0 energy , which is actually one of the regions studied experimentally .",
    "we have studied the different mechanisms of @xmath0 decay in a nuclear medium .",
    "we rely upon the ozi rule which makes the direct coupling of the @xmath0 to nucleons or nonstrange mesons small , and thus the @xmath0 decay is still driven by the @xmath3 or related channels in the medium .",
    "the @xmath0 width in the medium is hence obtained from previously developed models for the interaction of kaons in nuclei , which have been tested in @xmath49 atoms recently .",
    "the gauge nature of the @xmath0 as a vector field also introduces some vertex corrections which lead to a moderate increase of the @xmath0 decay width .",
    "we have evaluated this width as a function of the energy of the @xmath0 and the nuclear density of the medium and have separated the contribution of the different reaction channels , which can eventually be investigated in some experiments for @xmath0 production in nuclei .",
    "the relevance of these findings for the dressing of kaons in nuclei and its relationship to the eventual kaon condensation in dense matter , as well as the implications for the running experiments of dilepton production in heavy ion collisions , should stimulate the performance of @xmath0 production in nuclei with some particle nucleus collisions which could serve us to test the ideas and results obtained in the present work .",
