    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest sources in the gamma - ray sky and they may also be among the most distant sources in the universe . the discovery by the batse detector on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) that the spatial distribution of grbs is isotropic and inhomogeneous ( meegan et al",
    ". 1992 , 1996 ) suggests that the sources are either in an extended galactic halo or at cosmological distances . the level of isotropy of the grb spatial distribution limits halo models to core radii of around 5080 kpc ( hakkila et al .",
    "1995 ) ; tighter constraints are expected for more recent data accumulations , and briggs et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that a galactic halo shell distribution must be at least 120 kpc distant .",
    "the observed average fluxes of grbs at earth therefore imply high luminosities for isotropically emitting sources : @xmath7 at a distance of @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 at a distance of @xmath10 gpc .",
    "in addition , rapid time variability ( @xmath11 several ms ) is observed in grb light curves , whose structural diversity is illustrated , for example in the batse 1b catalogue in fishman et al .",
    "this variability implies a compact source size , which in combination with the high luminosities yields photon densities that are high enough to make galactic halo or cosmological grbs optically thick to photon - photon pair production by many orders of magnitude .",
    "one would then expect attenuation of the observed spectrum ( perhaps as a quasi - exponential cutoff , trough or shelf : examples are depicted in baring and harding 1997 ) around the pair production threshold of 1 mev if the grb sources are more distant than a few kpc and have quasi - isotropic radiation fields ( schmidt 1978 , epstein 1985 ) .",
    "yet grb spectra are observed to extend well beyond 1 mev and into the gev range . the grs detector on the smm satellite first measured emission in grb spectra significantly above 1 mev , often extending up to 10 mev ( e.g. nolan et al . 1983 ) , and in one case up to 80 mev ( share et al . 1986 ) .",
    "batse routinely observes grb spectra extending up to and above 1 mev . while most bursts exhibit spectral steepening at a variety of energies between 50 kev and few hundred kev ( band et al .",
    "1993 ; see also schaefer et al .",
    "1994 for the batse 1b spectroscopy catalogue ) , a number of bursts display spectral breaks between 500 kev and about 2 mev ( schaefer et al .",
    "1992 ) , but no cutoffs .",
    "the egret instrument , also on cgro , has detected emission above 50 mev from four of the brighter grbs triggered by batse , a fifth up to 30 mev and another three up to a few mev ; all are consistent with power - law spectra extending to as high as 1.2 gev , in the case of grb930131 ( sommer et al .",
    "1994 ) , and 3.4 gev for grb940217 ( hurley et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the grb940217 source is best known for exhibiting delayed or prolonged high energy emission , detected 80100 minutes ( i.e. more than one full earth orbit of cgro ) after the initial trigger , including a photon of energy 18 gev ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) that is not markedly inconsistent with extrapolation of the power - law continuum .",
    "in fact , some evidence for delayed high energy emission pre - dated grb940217 , with the observation ( dingus et al . 1994 ) of a single 10 gev photon that could have been associated with grb910503 .",
    "it is clear that , in contrast to soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , which are now believed to probably be a separate class of galactic sources ( although the classical grb behaviour reported by fenimore , klebesadel and laros 1996 of the 5th march 1979 outburst at early times can support proponents of grb - sgr associations ) , there have been no attenuation - type turnovers or cutoffs observed in a grb spectrum .",
    "high energy gamma - ray emission therefore may be common in bursts , and the egret detection rate is consistent ( dingus 1995 , though this inference is subject to poor statistics ) with all bursts emitting above about 30 mev .",
    "observed grb spectra are therefore in direct conflict with predicted pair production cutoffs for isotropic emission .",
    "an obvious solution ( e.g. krolik and pier 1991 , fenimore , epstein and ho 1992 ) is to allow some anisotropy of the emission , so that the interaction angles @xmath12 of the photons are restricted .",
    "the threshold for pair production , @xmath13 $ ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energies of a test photon and an interacting photon in units of @xmath16 , could therefore be increased above the maximum observed energy .",
    "beaming of the radiation can be achieved through relativistic motion : the radiation from a source that is isotropically emitting in the comoving frame will be beamed mostly within an angle of the order of @xmath17 in the observer s frame , where @xmath18 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "for the case of a small emitting blob moving relativistically , the pair production optical depth is reduced by a factor @xmath19 below the optical depth for isotropic radiation , where @xmath20 is the photon spectral index ( krolik & pier 1991 , baring 1993 ) .",

    "1994 ) up to an energy of gev are @xmath22 at a distance of 1 gpc and @xmath23 at 30 kpc ( harding 1994 , harding & baring 1994 ) . in this case of",
    "relativistic beaming within angle @xmath17 , the required luminosity at the source is smaller because the observed flux , @xmath24 , is enhanced by a solid angle factor @xmath25 ( krolik & pier 1991 ) .",
    "however , the number of sources must be a factor @xmath25 higher in order to account for the observed number of grbs . in the case of cosmological grbs",
    ", this factor could be as high as @xmath26 for the above limits on @xmath18 .",
    "this is unacceptably large for many of the proposed models , including neutron star  neutron star or neutron star",
    " black hole mergers ( paczynski 1986 ; eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; narayan , piran and shemi 1991 ; mszros & rees 1992 ) , failed type 1b supernovae ( woosley 1993 ) and rapid spin - down of high - field millisecond pulsars ( usov 1992 ) , and hence defines the so - called `` number problem '' for beamed cosmological bursts .",
    "source geometries with beaming angles larger than @xmath17 could ease this problem if the high energy photons were able to escape .",
    "in fact , the radiation from grb sources in the galactic halo or at cosmological distances is expected to involve a wind or fireball expanding relativistically ( paczynski 1986 , goodman 1986 , piran and shemi 1993 ) .",
    "fenimore , epstein & ho ( 1993 ) have shown that a relativistically - expanding , thin spherical shell will allow escape of high energy gamma - rays , because a test photon on the surface of the shell will not be able to interact with all other emitted photons due to causality limits .",
    "this arises as a consequence of the transient nature of the emission , since then only photons emitted within a  look - back \" surface around the test photon will interact to contribute to the pair production optical depth .",
    "the fenimore , epstein & ho ( 1993 ) calculation was limited to the case of an infinitely thin shell .    in this study , we have extended the calculation of the pair production optical depth in grb sources to the full range of source geometries : opening angles from @xmath17 to a spherical expansion , and shells of arbitrary thickness .",
    "the optical depth for test photons emitted within the expanding shell will be limited to interaction with other photons within a  look - back \" volume .",
    "we present analytic development and simplification of the pair production optical depth , make detailed numerical calculations , and derive analytic expressions in various limits .",
    "the intent is to provide a model - independent evaluation of the pair production opacity of a relativistically expanding , transient gamma - ray source whose emitted spectrum extends above observed energies . using our results , we derive estimates for the minimum bulk lorentz factors required for source transparency in those grbs detected by egret at high energies .",
    "these limits are largely insensitive to the source opening angle provided that it exceeds .",
    "this reflects the strong impact of causality in determining the optical depth , and clearly renders the number problem for cosmological source models a non - issue : the total negation of this number problem for a wide range of expansion geometries is a principal conclusion of this paper .",
    "a detailed description of the source geometry and the derivation of an analytic form for the pair production optical depth ( and associated limiting cases ) for infinite power - law source spectra are presented in section  2 ; there the general quintuple integral expression for [ see eq .",

    "readers more interested in the applications and implications of our calculations than in the detailed derivations presented in section  2 should note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tauppfin ] ) is the final form for the pair production optical depth , which should be used in conjunction with the normalization specified via the flux in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxasymp ] ) .",
    "the generic picture of a gamma - ray burst that is considered here assumes the photon source ( i.e. region of emission ) to be expanding with constant and homogeneous bulk lorentz factor , with opening angle about some axis and thickness ( constant throughout ) in the observer s frame , and with the initial condition ( at time ) that the source s inner radius is .",
    "the expansion therefore traces a conical volume and can assume a variety of geometries such as solid cones , solid spheres or spherical shells , at any given time , depending on the values of the input parameters and .",
    "the constancy of in time is a convenient assumption that is not strictly valid during early epochs of the expansion if is not much less than unity : when , the expansion initially resembles a quasi - isotropic and almost stationary radiation gas in the observer s frame .",
    "the adiabatic redistribution of momenta that naturally occurs in expanding ( and `` inert '' ) photon gases is therefore neglected .",
    "we also opt to ignore the consideration of possible dynamic acceleration or deceleration of the underlying plasma , since such dynamics are quite model - dependent .",
    "suppose that a test ( i.e. potentially observable ) photon , with energy , is emitted at time from the inner radius of the shell and moves through the source to eventually escape and reach the observer .",
    "we opt for test photons originating at the back of the expansion throughout this paper ; starting these photons closer to the outer surface will reduce the optical depth they encounter by a factor of order unity , so that the results we obtain will be qualitatively representative of general initial positions for test photons within the source . if the angle cosine between the test photon s momentum and position vectors is , then the radial distance of the test photon from the center of the expansion , at any time , is @xmath27 the overall geometry of this source expansion is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a and is discussed in more detail below .",
    "radial propagation of the test photon along the axis of the expansion corresponds to .",
    "an important assumption about the expansion that is made in this paper is that no photons are present prior to time .",
    "this `` switch - on '' stipulation restricts the photon population that can causally interact with the test photon at early times , and indeed mimics burst temporal behaviour ; it is anticipated that the details of the switch - on will have only a quantitative rather than a qualitative influence on the results presented .",
    "the objective of this section is to derive an analytic expression for the pair production optical depth for this expanding source geometry .",
    "consideration of the influence of the plasma that is present in the emission region on the photons it generates will be omitted from this analysis .",
    "the optical depth for two - photon pair production can be obtained from well - known expressions for the reaction rate for interactions of photons in a single population ( e.g. see eq .  ( 27 ) of weaver 1976 , or eq .",

    "it is instructive to identify the typical energy of photons that interact with test photons at , specifically for an expansion of bulk lorentz factor that spawns power - law photon spectra , the conditions pertaining to the analysis of this paper .",

    "this result holds regardless of the source photon density provided phase space near threshold is accessible , which always is the case for infinite power - law spectra .      before developing the calculation of the pair production optical depth",
    "it is both necessary and elucidating to elaborate the details of the expansion geometry and define useful spatial variables .",

    "( [ eq : rtlim ] ) leads to the determination of the time the test photon takes to escape the expanding plasma : @xmath31 of course , calculation of the pair production optical depth will involve an integration over times , including when the test photon has escaped the expanding plasma .",

    "the geometry of the source defined above , restricts the values of the variables and that prescribe the position of the interacting photons .",
    "these restrictions arise because the interacting photons can only be emitted from the portion of the region that the expanding plasma occupied at the time of emission that is causally connected to the test photon . in the radial direction , the volume that the emission region occupies at time",

    "this concludes the presentation of the general forms for the constraints the source geometry places on the spatial variables defined ; specific developments in subsequent sections are made according to algebraic need .",
    "it shall prove convenient to define three dimensionless variables that will facilitate the algebraic developments of the optical depth that are performed in this paper : @xmath39 the first two of these are scaling transformations that define the coupling of length scales in the expansion ; they are used to reduce the number of integrations in the optical depth over spatial variables by one [ see eq .",

    "these three variables will be referred to extensively in subsequent equations .",
    "hereafter , this paper addresses the special case of radial propagation of test photons along the axis of the expansion , so that and . while this choice is motivated by the simplifications it introduces to the analysis , it is concordant with the goal of obtaining representative estimates of source bulk lorentz factors that are consistent with grb observations .",
    "relativistically expanding sources contribute most of their observable emission along the direction of motion , corresponding to radial and on - axis propagation of the test photons . off - axis",
    "( i.e. non - radial ) emission will mostly be outside the peak of beamed radiation , and therefore form only a minor part of the observable flux of gamma - rays .",
    "hence we expect that photons produced somewhat off - axis will contribute minimally to the observed flux , and therefore be largely irrelevant to the determination of minimum bulk lorentz factors .",
    "a brief discussion of this specialization , in the light of the results obtained , is presented in section  4 . note",
    "that while `` limb '' photons move on average at large angles to the beamed photon population in their locale , the phase space that connects them causally to the remaining photon population is small ; it is not clear whether or not limb photons will have enhanced pair production optical depths relative to line - of - sight radiation .      the differential optical depth in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtaudrt ] ) can be developed once the photon distribution function is known , and eventually an integration over will be performed to obtain the total optical depth . the form that takes depends on basic assumptions about the expanding photon gas . in this paper , the _ rate of photon emission is taken to be constant in time and space after time ( following , for example , fenimore et al .",
    "1993 , but in contrast to the uniform density choice made by harding and baring 1994 ) , but is zero for , and is isotropic only in the comoving frame of the expansion .",
    "this simplifying assumption is made for its convenience ; it is unrealistic since it may be acausal for some initial conditions ( e.g. the instantaneous `` switch - on '' over a finite volume ) .",
    "observed temporal behaviour in individual sources is somewhat chaotic ( e.g. see the batse 1b catalogue , fishman et al . 1994 ) , so the assumption of constant emissivity is not truly accurate , depending on the timescale of specific consideration .",
    "however , in conjunction with the source geometry prescribed here , a constant emissivity may be able to approximately produce global properties of bursts , such as longer average decay timescales than rise times ( nemiroff et al .",
    ", 1994 ; norris , et al .",
    "1994 ; mitrofanov 1995 ) .",
    "our assumption of a temporally - invariant emissivity after switch - on is an appropriate approximation for the objectives of this paper , since only estimates of the bulk relativistic motion in gamma - ray bursts are at present obtainable as the origin of bursts is still uncertain .",
    "note that the rate of emission might be expected to decline in time due to expansion effects such as adiabatic cooling and a decrease in plasma density .",
    "an immediate consequence of this approximation is that the photon distribution in the comoving frame of the expansion is anisotropic even for isotropic photon emission , due to radiative transfer effects in finite source volumes .",
    "this assumption is clearly different from the premise of gould and schreder ( 1967 ) , from which the bulk motion analyses of krolik and pier ( 1991 ) and baring ( 1993 ) are derived , who all effectively assumed that the photon _",
    "distribution is everywhere and at all times isotropic ( krolik and pier 1991 actually invoked the equivalent assumption of isotropy of the photon intensity in the comoving frame ) .",
    "isotropy of the photon distribution is an even more elementary approximation : it is perhaps less realistic than the assumption of isotropic emission rate that is made here , given that isotropic radiation fields are usually best generated in optically ( thomson ) thick media , contrary to the basis of these pair - production calculations .",
    "isotropic emissivities require only that the supporting particle population is isotropic , and that there is no other preferred direction in the emission region , such as that imposed by the presence of a magnetic field . _      for a constant rate of photon emission ,",
    "the photon distribution at any point is simply obtained by adapting standard radiative transfer results ( e.g. see rybicki and lightman , 1979 ) to the consideration of photon densities .",
    "the conservation of photon numbers and volume elements along light rays in optically thin environments automatically yields conservation of the number density , from which the transfer equation yields @xmath40 here traces out the photon path through the look - back volume and is the rate of photon emission in the observer s frame , per unit solid angle , at the position of the interacting photon ( the point labelled i in fig .",

    "this can be easily seen if the spectrum is attenuated by an exponential factor , a common choice .",
    "a central consequence of the assumption of an infinite power - law burst spectrum is that the optical depth is an _ increasing _ ( and power - law ) function of energy , so that spectral attenuation arises only at high energies ; departures from this behaviour will be discussed briefly at the end of the next section .",
    "we remark also that opacity skin effects ( which depend on the spatial distribution of photons and therefore are model - dependent ) can sometimes render the exponential a poor descriptor of attenuation , with perhaps being an improvement for uniformly - distributed photons , leading to broken power - laws rather than exponential turnovers .",
    "a variety of signatures of spectral attenuation are possible , particularly if pair cascading is involved , and some of these are illustrated in the work of baring and harding ( 1997 ) .",

    "[ fig : taupp ] is that causality minimizes the role of the opening angle of the expansion in faster expansions , and specifically that the condition will be virtually independent of in the range for burst sources .",

    "alternative size - estimates , such as those that couple the source variability to dimensions along the line of sight to the source , are possible .",

    "motivations for choosing either of these , and also different source size determinations , are discussed below .",
    "both variability timescales are addressed in the results presented here , for the sake of completeness .",
    "the key observable parameters , to be used in the pair production opacity calculations of this paper , are displayed in table  [ table2 ] for six of the burst detections by egret .",
    "note that there are eleven egret bursts in total ( schneid et al .",

    "these fluxes are obtained via extrapolations down to 1 mev of the best - fit power - laws to the time - integrated super - mev spectral data , and are not necessarily the actual fluxes measured at 1 mev .",
    "note that both egret and comptel parameters are listed for grb 910601 since this burst was relatively soft and actually had a slightly more significant detection by comptel than by the egret tasc in the 35 mev range .",

    "1994 ) differ slightly from those quoted by baring and harding ( 1993 ) that were obtained from winkler et al .",
    "as noted in the table caption , in the computations of this paper we neglect the highest energy ( 18 gev ) photon detected for grb 940217 .",
    "this conservative step is taken because the statistically - limited sample provided by a single photon leads to a large uncertainty in the spectral form at these energies , which is compounded by the lack of contemporaneous spectral information at lower ( i.e. sub - mev ) energies ( e.g. hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) ; time - resolved spectra of good statistical quality in the super-100 mev range await future generations of instrumentation .",
    "a nice depiction of the relative fluxes and spectra of four of these bursts is given in hurley ( 1996 ) .      before presenting the results for the bulk lorentz factor constraints inferred from our optical depth calculations here , it is instructive to first review the results of previous , more primitive bulk motion determinations . as outlined in the introduction ,",
    "the earlier work of krolik and pier ( 1991 ) and baring ( 1993 ) , and subsequent papers , considered `` blobs '' of radiation - emitting material moving at relativistic speeds more - or - less along the line of sight to an observer .",
    "the angular extent of these blobs , i.e. the width of the angular distribution of photons as measured in the observer s frame , was assumed to be comparable to , where was the lorentz factor of the blob ( ) . for such relativistically - moving blobs , the minimum bulk lorentz factors at redshift are obtained ( i.e. for ) from the result derived by baring and harding ( 1993 , corrected in harding 1994 ) : @xmath76 here is just the source flux evaluated at 1 mev , per mev energy interval , and therefore is proportional to .",
    "this formula can be approximately reproduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : thinshell ] ) by setting .",
    "alternatively the thick shell approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullsphere ] ) gives more or less the same estimate if .",
    "it therefore follows that the `` blob calculation '' corresponds to the boundary between thin and thick shell cases where the line - of - sight and transverse ( e.g. variability ) timescales are comparable .",
    "furthermore , it also coincides with the boundary of narrow beam expansions , namely for , as can be established by setting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beam ] ) and choosing intermediate shell thicknesses .    we remark here that the choice of variability timescale for use in the estimation of minimum source bulk lorentz factors is subjective .",
    "the smallest observed in batse data ( see fishman et al .",
    "1994 ) is of the order of milliseconds , and it is quite conceivable that intrinsic source variability occurs on even shorter timescales .",
    "such small were adopted in the work of baring ( 1993 ) , baring and harding ( 1993 , 1995 , 1996 ) and harding ( 1994 ) , and lead to light - crossing time size determinations of cm .",
    "however , variability in the hard gamma - ray band , i.e. for comptel and egret data , can only be conclusively inferred from more severely photon - limited samples on the order of 0.1 second to 1 second timescales .",
    "hence a conservative approach , adopted for example by ryan et al .",
    "( 1994 , for grb 930131 ) and winkler et al .",
    "( 1995 , for grb 940217 ) , uses these longer values in obtaining pair production constraints on bulk motion in bursts .",
    "note that the relative timescales in the different grb energy bands may not be related at all to intrinsic source properties but merely reflect current instrumental limitations in the time domain .",
    "while experimentalists might prefer the conservative variability values , theorists are often motivated to attribute the shortest timescales to regions emitting the highest energies of radiation .",
    "this is frequently justifiable in astrophysics , since a whole host of cosmic objects are powered from a central region and thereby generate their most energetic photons closer to the center ; such photons would generally be expected to couple to shorter timescales .",
    "if a central `` powerhouse '' is indeed responsible for gamma - ray burst emission ( as suggested by fenimore , madras and nayakshin 1996 ) , then sub - millisecond timescales might accurately reflect the source conditions appropriate to egret photons .",
    "in contrast , if bursts approximate more closely the class of fireball models that generate the emission we see by impact on the interstellar medium ( e.g. rees and mszros 1992 , mszros and rees 1993 ) , perhaps through diffusive acceleration of particles at shocks , then the highest energy photons are produced by particles diffusing on the largest scales of the system , and therefore might be expected to have longer variability timescales than photons in the batse energy range . to accommodate a variety of perspectives ,",
    "this paper considers values of ms and 1 second .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammablob ] ) for the minimum bulk lorentz factor for the burst parameters of table  [ table2 ] are listed in table  [ table3 ] , for the two different variability timescales , and for four different grb source distances that are typical of galactic disk , galactic halo , and nearby and distant cosmological populations ( though the redshift is chosen for simplicity ) .",
    "the immediately obvious conclusion is that , except for a disk origin of bursts , relativistic bulk motion is generally inferred for the egret sources , because of the detection of energetic photons .",
    "the lorentz factors obtained for cosmological distance scales far exceed those inferred for extragalactic jets in active galaxies .",
    "conversely , table  [ table3 ] indicates that isotropic emission can not be supported in grbs unless they are quite local , i.e. well within the galactic disk , a conclusion that differs from schmidt s ( 1978 ) early work principally because of the positive egret detections in the cgro era .",
    "these estimates for the minimum in bursts are a good first guide to constraints on bulk motion in their emission regions ; the refinements of the burst geometries addressed in this paper only modify the estimates in table  [ table3 ] by factors of at most a few , as will become evident shortly .",
    "we remark that previous versions of these estimates ( e.g. baring 1993 , baring and harding 1993 , harding 1994 , baring 1995 ) have sometimes used slightly different observational parameters .",

    "other choices are possible , such as using burst or subpulse durations ( e.g. fenimore , madras and nayakshin 1996 ) and/or relating these to longitudinal dimensions in the source .",
    "it is fitting to outline the reasons for adhering to our preference .",
    "suppose that timescales larger than the variability time , for example the burst duration , are used as the observational diagnostic of the source size .",
    "for uniform expansions , as we have assumed , the geometrical appearance of the `` look - back '' volume forces the time profile to maintain a well - defined shape ( for spectral index ) that mimics the so - named fred ( fast rise , exponential decay ) profile ( fenimore , madras and nayakshin 1996 ) .",
    "this profile necessarily has a width of the order of under these assumptions , so that its smooth , decaying shape is inconsistent with the vast majority of burst time histories .",
    "temporal consistency can therefore be attained only if the appropriate observational timescale is of the order of the variability time , so that the burst comprises a multitude of shells , or perhaps if a single shell is `` patchy '' in the transverse dimension .",
    "the latter possibility still produces time profiles that do not match many burst histories , so that one is compelled to adopt the many - shell proposition , perhaps produced by a central engine , as advocated by fenimore , madras and nayakshin ( 1996 ) .",
    "the timescale that is then appropriate is , precisely our choice , though the value of this depends on whether batse or egret variabilities are used ( as discussed in section  3.1 above ) .",
    "the issue of whether the variability should be tied to transverse or longitudinal source dimensions remains to be addressed .",
    "since is always close to the threshold of temporal resolution of any of the cgro instruments batse , comptel and egret , it is appropriate to assume that _ measured _ variability is actually an upper bound to the source variability .",
    "if we opt to relate this to the direction transverse to the line of sight to the observer , then the inequality follows , and it is customary to take the equality to specify . by the same token ,",
    "if dimensions along the line of sight are preferred , this inequality is replaced by .",
    "a consistent description of the expansion can only be obtained when both of these inequalities are satisfied , which obviously occurs when the more - constraining is adopted .",
    "this motivates our choice of coupling the variability to the transverse dimension ; tying it to the line - of - sight direction is insufficiently restrictive .",
    "notwithstanding , the difference between these two choices is merely one lorentz factor in the optical depth [ compared with around five or six imposed by the spectrum : see eq .",
    "( [ eq : beam ] ) ] , to which the estimates of are quite insensitive : opting for reduces by factors of the order of two or less .",
    "other possibilities for choosing the scale of the expansion exist , such as , and these are discussed at length in the temporal analysis of fenimore , madras and nayakshin ( 1996 ) . note that fixing with either or yields , comfortably in the phase space covered by fig .",
    "[ fig : thetabdelta ] .",
    "the essential point that should be emphasized is that these subjective alternatives probe details of the expansion microstructure that are beyond the purpose of this analysis , and are largely peripheral to it , primarily because of the relative insensitivity of the estimates to these choices .",
    "the principal conclusions of this paper , including the insensitivity of the optical depth to the expansion opening angle , are guaranteed regardless of such variations on our assumptions .",
    "one question that naturally arises when obtaining estimates for the bulk lorentz factors via pair production constraints is why the values of  obtained here for cosmological bursts are of the same order as those obtained from fireball expansions ( e.g. paczynski 1986 ; shemi & piran 1990 ; rees & mszros 1992 ) of enormous initial optical depths .",
    "this similarity is no coincidence .",
    "the bulk motions attained by the adiabatic expansion phase of pure electron - positron ( pair ) fireballs yield lorentz factors that saturate at some value corresponding more or less to the `` freeze - out '' of pair production , i.e. the epoch of free expansion is approximately marked by the onset of pair production transparency .",
    "for cosmological bursts , where the luminosities can be of the order of erg / sec and the energy deposition can be larger than ergs , the optical depth is roughly ( e.g. , for spectra ) and can be or larger for , where is the size of the fireball at the end of the epoch of opacity in units of cm .",
    "this optical depth can be reduced to unity by relativistic beaming with in the range of  when . since the lorentz factor attained during the fireball `` acceleration phase '' scales roughly as its radius ( e.g. paczynski 1986",
    "; piran , shemi and narayan 1993 ) , then it follows that values of a freeze - out radius of would correspond to  for fireballs initiated in regions of diameter cm .",
    "these cm scalelengths for the onset of expansion transparency are comparable to those used for in this paper , thereby explaining the similarity of our estimates for to the lorentz factors of fireball - initiated relativistic expansions .",
    "the results we have presented focus on the energy range appropriate to egret detections of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "there are now ongoing programs for searches for bursts at tev energies , specifically the target of opportunity monitoring of batse localization error boxes by the whipple air erenkov experiment , using the rapid response that is facilitated by the bacodine alert network ( barthelmy et al .",
    "1995 ) . while these efforts have failed to provide any positive tev detections so far , probably due to the fact that whipple s sensitivity threshold still inhibits any possibility of detection for all but the very brightest of bursts ( see connaughton et al .",
    "1995 for a discussion of the current whipple sensitivity ) , the prospect of large field of view monitoring of the sky by the air erenkov water tank detector milagro ( e.g. yodh 1996 ) in the very near future , promotes the extension of our bulk motion estimates to the tev energy range . such considerations also anticipate future space missions like glast , which will span the 10 mev200 gev range .",
    "obviously , increasing to tev - type energies would tend to push estimates of the bulk lorentz factor up , in order to suppress pair creation . to explore the implications of tev - emitting bursts sources for estimates of",
    ", we computed the infinite power - law `` blob '' calculation solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammablob ] ) , and depicted them in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammintev ] , as a function of the spectral index .",
    "it is sufficient to focus on this simplest of cases , noting that the complicating effects of expansion geometry mirror those considered at lower maximum energies .    in the figure",
    ", the cosmological cases exhibited the expected trend of a dramatic increase in for flatter spectra , a consequence of the enhanced supply of interacting photons at ( generally well above 511 kev ) for lower values of .",
    "for typical egret source spectral indices , in the range 23 , is indeed an increasing function of .",
    "however , for , this behaviour is reversed , with declining with , because the optical depth in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : gammablob ] ) is then a decreasing function of .",
    "note that in the figure , the galactic halo case ( kpc ) displays a comparative insensitivity of to .",
    "this insensitivity arises because the energies ( ) of the photons interacting with those at are generally relatively near the pivotal energy of kev , where the source flux is pinned . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammintev ] , the source flux at 511 kev is typical of batse burst detections ; for this flux , the milagro experiment will be sensitive to bursts with , a dividing line that is marked in the figure .",
    "hence , only bright , flat spectrum sources like grb 910503 provide good candidates for potential detections at tev energies by milagro , and for that matter whipple .",
    "glast will have the capability of spanning the egret and sub - tev energy ranges .",
    "this extension of estimates to values in the tev range of course assumes that bursts intrinsically emit at such high energies .",
    "note that for the cosmological case , such intrinsic burst emission is also subject to pair creation in collisions with photons supplied by radiation fields external to the burst , for example the infrared background ( stecker and de jager 1996 , mannheim , hartmann and funk 1996 ) .",
    "this type of attenuation is strongly dependent on the redshift of the source , so that sources at 1 gpc would be strongly attenuated at 1 tev , while those at 100 mpc would be transparent .",
    "such external attenuation considerations are beyond the scope of this paper , and are examined in detail by mannheim , hartmann and funk ( 1996 ) .",
    "the analysis of this paper has made the expedient assumption that the burst spectra are infinite power - laws , with the spectrum matching that observed by egret .",
    "this , of course assumes that the turnovers seen at sub - mev energies in batse data are immaterial to pair production calculations .",
    "the relevance of spectral curvature below the egret range to attenuation studies depends upon the energies of the photons that interact with the test photons at , which generally are around in the stationary observer s reference frame for infinite power - laws , as discussed just above .",
    "clearly , low energy spectral paucity ( relative to egret - range power - laws ) at around limits contributions near threshold so that phase space near the pair production threshold is inaccessible , and the process is pushed into the klein - nishina regime : the optical depth drops accordingly .",
    "hence mev and sub - mev spectral curvature plays a role in opacity determinations when , a situation that manifests itself at galactic halo ( or even galactic disk ) distances for most of the egret bursts , as is evident from an inspection of tables  [ table2 ] and  [ table3 ] .",
    "consequently , regimes of transparency may become possible at high energies in galactic bursts , so that the range of opacity becomes finite .",
    "these issues are discussed in detail in baring and harding ( 1997 ) , where it is demonstrated that realistic broad - band grb spectra may yield broad absorption troughs ( and also other spectral forms such as shelfs ) in the 1 gev  1 tev range of bursts spectra in galactic halo sources , distinctive spectral features whose existence or otherwise could be probed by experiments such as glast , whipple and milagro .",
    "note however , that for cosmological sources , the inferred s are so high that always exceeds unity and the infinite power - law calculations presented here are always quite appropriate . as a result ,",
    "the optical depth is then always monotonically increasing in , so that only simple ( exponential or power - law ) spectral turnovers are possible .",
    "hence , baring and harding ( 1997 ) postulated that such distinguishable spectral structure may provide a means of discriminating between a galactic or cosmological origin for gamma - ray bursts , an enticing prospect for the high energy astrophysics community .",
    "in this paper , we have presented our extension of pair production transparency calculations in relativistically expanding gamma - ray burst sources to quite general geometries , including shells of finite thickness and arbitrary opening angle .",
    "this work includes an extensive analytic reduction of the optical depth from a quintuple integral to a single integral in the special , but quite broadly applicable , case of observing photons only along the axis of the expansion .",
    "such a reduction is extremely expedient for opacity and transparency considerations , providing the reliable and numerically - amenable analytic expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) and  ( [ eq : tauppfin ] ) that completely describe the pair production optical depth .",
    "we determine that the minimum bulk lorentz factor for the egret sources to be optically thin up to the maximum energies observed , i.e. display no spectral attenuation , is only moderately dependent on the shell thickness and virtually independent of its opening solid angle if @xmath80 .",
    "this insensitivity to @xmath4 , which is a consequence of the strong impact that causality has on the available interaction phase space , relieves the commonly - perceived number problem for non - repeating sources at cosmological distances : it is not necessary to invoke small @xmath4 to effect photon escape .",
    "this negation of the number problem for a wide range of expansion geometries is the principal conclusion of this paper , and is an important result for specific cosmological burst models .",
    "the values of obtained , typically of the order of 1030 for halo bursts and for sources of cosmological origin , depend only moderately on the choice of grb timescale used to determine the expansion size .",
    "our new limits on required expansion velocity for given source geometries will significantly aid the placing of realistic constraints on gamma - ray burst source models .",
