    "electromagnetic processes have always played a central role in studies of the structure of nuclei , nucleons and their excitations .",
    "recently , the interest in the electroproduction of the @xmath0(1232 ) and other nucleon resonances has increased , fueled by the large number of experiments planned and already running in several centers ( mainz , bonn , mit , tjnaf , etc ) , where very clean electromagnetic probes are now available . in this paper",
    "we report on a theoretical calculation of the multipole amplitudes of the n-@xmath0 electromagnetic transitions .    the process @xmath5 has been considered in the framework of several models of baryon structure . from the point of view of a pure quark model , the @xmath0 state results from a spin flip of one quark in the nucleon .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetic - dipole transition and vanishing quadrupole transitions .",
    "the experimental observation of quadrupole transitions , although small in comparison with the magnetic dipole , caused a discussion about the structure of the nucleon and the delta . in models only with quarks ,",
    "non - vanishing quadrupole electric and scalar nucleon - delta transition amplitudes result from @xmath6-state admixtures to the quarks lowest @xmath7-state , otherwise those amplitudes would be identically zero @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole transitions resulting from such charge deformations are generally small .",
    "however , other explanations can be found , in particular the contribution of pions included in the baryon model states @xcite , as in the type of effective theories considered in the present work .",
    "our calculations are carried on in the framework of two well known quark - meson models of the baryon structure , namely , the linear sigma model ( lsm ) @xcite and the chiral chromodielectric model ( cdm ) @xcite , which have been used to describe the structure of the nucleon @xcite . in these models , a baryon  such as the nucleon  is a soliton with three bare valence quarks , all in the same orbital - spin - isospin state , interacting with chiral @xmath1 and @xmath8 meson fields . in the cdm",
    ", there is an additional interaction with a scalar - isoscalar chiral singlet meson field  the chromodielectric field , @xmath9 . except for a small explicit chiral symmetry breaking term",
    ", both models are su(2)@xmath10su(2 ) chiral invariant , a symmetry which is spontaneously broken to su(2 ) , the pions being the goldstone bosons .",
    "although the two models use essentially the same ingredients , they provide quite different pictures of the nucleon ( and of the delta ) . in the lsm",
    "the stability of the cluster of three quarks interacting with the mesons depends on the quark - meson interaction strength .",
    "a soliton is formed when the coupling constant for that interaction is sufficiently large , and it turns out that a strong meson cloud ( particularly a pion cloud ) is required for stabilizing the system . in the lsm , the chiral mesons bind the three quarks . in the cdm , besides the interaction between the quarks and the chiral mesons , there is an interaction between the chromodielectric field and the quarks . as a result of this interaction",
    "the quarks acquire a position - dependent dynamical mass which is an increasing function of the distance .",
    "the quarks are thus prevented to move too far away from the origin and such mechanism effectively generates quark confinement .",
    "the role of the chiral mesons , although conceptually important to implement chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking , gets much suppressed and the resulting picture of the baryon is a soliton with three confined valence quarks surrounded by a weak cloud of chiral mesons ( particularly pions ) . by considering two models providing such extreme pictures of the nucleon , namely with quite different meson clouds , we are able to address interesting questions e.g. how electromagnetic transition amplitudes are sensitive to quantities such as the  number of pions \" presented in the baryon states .    in the framework of the chiral models considered in this paper , the nucleon and the delta are made out of neutral ( @xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 ) and charged ( quarks and @xmath12 ) particles , the latter coupling directly to the electromagnetic probe ( a virtual or a real photon ) .",
    "the three quarks are assumed in the same orbital - spin - isospin state occupying the lowest @xmath7-state ( no @xmath6-state admixture ) , represented by @xmath13 .",
    "moreover the hedgehog state is assumed for the spin - isospin wavefunction of the quarks .",
    "the three valence quarks are therefore described by the fully symmetric state , @xmath14 ( anti - symmetrization applies in color space  the state is a slater determinant in color space ) .",
    "a quantum mechanical description for the mesons is considered by means of coherent states representing pion , sigma and chi clouds , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the starting point to describe a baryon in the framework of the lsm and cdm is , therefore , the fock state @xmath18 .",
    "such state should then be projected onto angular momentum and isospin eigenstates in order to get states with the nucleon and delta quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the calculation reported in this work is a natural extension of @xcite .",
    "we have refined the approximations , namely by taking into account the state of motion of the initial and final baryon states involved in the nucleon  delta transition . to this end , a linear momentum projection @xcite of the initial and final baryon states is applied , following the method used in  @xcite for the calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "besides this conceptual improvement , we also present in more detail the formalism and address the issue of how the choice of the reference frame affects the theoretical transition amplitudes .",
    "other calculations of the electromagnetic @xmath19@xmath0 transition amplitudes carried out in several effective models of the nucleon have been reported in constituent quark models @xcite , with two - body exchange currents @xcite , in the skyrme model @xcite , in the cloudy bag model @xcite , in chiral quark solitons of nambu - jona - lasinio type with polarized dirac sea @xcite , etc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ secii ]",
    "we give a short account of the models and sketch the approximations used to construct model states representing the nucleon and the delta . in section [ seciii ]",
    "we develop the formalism for the application of the models to the electroproduction of the @xmath20 with a special emphasis on the implementation of the linear momentum projection .",
    "finally , the results are presented in section [ seciv ] together with their discussion .",
    "a summary of the main conclusions of this work is presented in section [ secv ] .",
    "the more technical aspects are given in the appendices .",
    "the lagrangian densities of the lsm and the cdm can be written , in a compact form , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the pure quark and chiral meson terms , @xmath23 is the quark - meson interaction term and @xmath24 absent in the lsm , contains the kinetic and potential terms for the chromodielectric field . in these expressions",
    "@xmath25 represents the quark field operator , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the chiral pion and sigma meson fields , respectively ( the arrow denotes isovector ) , and @xmath28 the chromodielectric field .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 in the denominator of the interaction lagrangian @xmath30 is @xmath31 in the lsm ( no @xmath9 field in this model ) and 1 in the cdm .    the meaning of the other terms appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2])([eq:5 ] ) is the following . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , @xmath32 is the mexican hat potential , @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is the coupling constant which is dimensionless in the lsm and has dimensions of energy in the cdm ( with @xmath34 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "is just the mass term for the @xmath9 field , @xmath35 being its mass .",
    "other versions of the cdm consider a potential which includes , besides the mass term , up to quartic terms in the @xmath9 field , as well as other powers of @xmath29 in the interaction term ( [ eq:4 ] ) . by just taking the mass term in the potential for @xmath9 and @xmath34 in the interaction , quark confinement is imposed in the smoothest way , which is the most appropriate choice for the quark matter sector of the cdm  @xcite .",
    "the mexican - hat potential is given by : @xmath36 the @xmath37 chiral symmetry of @xmath38 is explicitly broken by the small term @xmath39 .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are related to the sigma and pion masses , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and to the pion decay constant , @xmath45 : @xmath46 in ( [ mexh ] ) , @xmath6 is a constant which guarantees that @xmath47 .",
    "the mexican hat potential induces spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the chiral fields are zero for the pion and @xmath48 for the sigma : @xmath49 ( we use the hat symbol  @xmath50 \" whenever we want to stress the operatorial character of the fields ) .",
    "it is convenient to define a new sigma field , which we still denote by @xmath51 , as the fluctuation around the vacuum value , i.e. , we perform the replacement @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the vacuum expectation value of the ` new ' sigma field is zero , according to ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "altogether , the parameters of the models defined by ( [ eq:1 ] ) are the pion and sigma masses ( fixed at @xmath53  gev and @xmath54  gev ) , the pion decay constant ( @xmath55  gev ) , and @xmath33 in the lsm and @xmath33 and @xmath35 in the the cdm . in the simpler version of the cdm considered in this work",
    ", it turns out that the results are sensitive only to the combination @xmath56 .",
    "the physical region of the coupling constant is @xmath57 in the lsm @xcite and @xmath58  gev , in the cdm @xcite .",
    "we remark that the physical range of the coupling constant in the cdm is much narrower than in the lsm . for this reason , later on , in section iv , when we show the dependence of the results on the coupling constant ( all other parameters being fixed to the quoted values ) we shall only consider the lsm .",
    "the only free parameters are @xmath33 in the lsm and @xmath59 in the cdm and these are fixed in order to reproduce well the bulk of the nucleon properties .",
    "it is known that , in these quark - meson models , the delta - nucleon mass splitting is small .",
    "we may remedy this by adding to the hamiltonians of the models explicit bare baryon mass terms with different masses for the bare nucleon and the bare delta  @xcite .",
    "then there is one more parameter  the bare nucleon - bare delta mass difference  which can be fitted to reproduce the physical nucleon - delta mass splitting .",
    "the inclusion of such a term has little effect ( specially in the lsm ) in the wave - functions of both quarks and mesons .",
    "such a bare nucleon - delta mass splitting accounts for the residual chromomagnetic interaction and for the t hooft interaction which is attractive for the nucleon and absent in the delta .",
    "solutions of the lsm and cdm representing the physical baryons can be obtained using a variational approach based on the projected hedgehog ansatz  @xcite . for the sake of completeness we sketch the formalism here .",
    "we consider three valence quarks with spin and isospin state in the so - called hedgehog configuration : @xmath60 all quarks occupy the same lowest positive energy @xmath7-state of the model effective potential , given by the spinor @xmath61    in our approach , the pions , sigmas and chis ( in the cdm ) are described by coherent states : @xmath62 for the pions , @xmath63 for the sigmas and @xmath64 for the chis .",
    "the expectation values of the field operators in these coherent states are the mean meson fields .",
    "the hedgehog ansatz for the mesons reads : @xmath65 ( we remember that @xmath51 is now the fluctuating part of the original sigma field around the vacuum expectation value , @xmath48 ) . actually the spherical symmetry of sigmas and chis and the  hedgehog - like \" character of the pion with the peculiar isospin - coordinate space correlation , result from the quark spin - isospin hedgehog configuration ( [ ourico ] ) and from the requirement of minimum mean field energy solutions @xcite .",
    "the pion coherent state is @xmath66 \\exp\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\int d^3\\bbox k          \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_\\pi(k)}{2}}\\;\\xi_i(\\bbox k)a^\\dag_i          ( \\bbox k)\\right\\ }          \\left|{0}\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath67 creates a free pion with momentum @xmath68 and ( cartesian ) isospin index @xmath69 , @xmath70 is a normalization factor , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the pion amplitude .",
    "similarly , the sigma coherent state is given by @xmath73\\exp \\left\\ { \\int d^3\\bbox k          \\sqrt\\frac{\\omega_\\sigma(k)}{2}\\;\\eta(\\bbox k ) b^          \\dag(\\bbox k)\\right\\ }          \\left|{0}\\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the sigma creation operator , @xmath75 is the coherent state amplitude function for the @xmath1-field .",
    "a similar expression holds for the chi field and we denote the amplitude of the corresponding coherent state by @xmath76 .",
    "the coherent states are particularly easy to deal with because they are eigenstates of the annihilation operators , e.g. @xmath77 similar expressions hold , involving the annihilation operator of sigmas and chis .",
    "the coherent state amplitudes are the fourier transforms of the meson functions in coordinate space introduced in ( [ mesx1])([mesx3 ] ) , and exhibit the following hedgehog shape in momentum space : @xmath78    altogether the hedgehog baryon ansatz reads @xmath79 in the mean field approximation we demand the total energy functional @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the normal ordered hamiltonian of the models defined by ( [ eq:1 ] ) , to be stationary with respect to variations of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "of course , the meson wave functions may equivalently be determined by performing the variations with respect to the coherent state amplitudes @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the variations with respect to the functions of @xmath90 lead to a set of differential equations .",
    "for appropriate choices of the coupling constants , soliton solutions of those equations are obtained with three quarks absolutely confined ( in cdm ) @xcite or just bound ( in lsm ) @xcite .",
    "the solitons described by the hedgehog state , @xmath91 can not represent physical baryons because they are not eigenstates of angular momentum or isospin .",
    "in addition , ( [ eq : hedg ] ) represents a localized object and therefore the translational symmetry of the model hamiltonians is also broken in such states .",
    "in particular they contain spurious center - of - mass components which contribute to the energy and to other observables .",
    "states with good spin and isospin can be obtained from @xmath91 by means of the peierls - yoccoz projection .",
    "the hedgehog only contains states with @xmath92 and therefore , due to such space - isospace correlation , a single projection , either in spin or in isospin , is needed @xcite .",
    "we choose to project onto isospin . a baryon with isospin @xmath93 , spin @xmath92 and projection quantum numbers @xmath94 and @xmath7 ( for isospin and spin , respectively ) is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the isospin operator @xmath97 in this expression",
    ", @xmath98 stands for the rotation operator in isospin space , @xmath99 are the wigner matrices and the integration is performed over all orientations @xmath100 ( which represents the set of three euler angles in isospin space ) . in the following we consider @xmath101 and use the shorthand notation @xmath102 .    on the other hand ,",
    "a model state representing a baryon at rest can be obtained by applying a peierls - yoccoz projection onto linear momentum zero to the state already projected onto isospin ( and angular momentum ) .",
    "the peierls - yoccoz linear momentum projector is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the translation operator .",
    "a nucleon at rest is therefore represented by the model state @xmath105 for @xmath106 , the isospin - angular momentum projector operator and the linear momentum projector operator commute , but this is no longer the case for @xmath107 @xcite .    in order to include",
    "recoil effects in the calculations , in principle one should boost @xcite the zero momentum states ( [ estadoq0 ] ) , but the technical difficulties associated with boosting prevent , in practice , the use of such a procedure .",
    "however , at least for small linear momentum @xmath108 , we may approximate the boost operation by the peierls - yoccoz projection onto linear momentum @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "thus , the model state representing a physical baryon of angular momentum and isospin @xmath109 and linear momentum @xmath108 is @xmath110 proper normalization of the projected state requires the inclusion of kinematical normalization factors .",
    "for example a nucleon with four - momentum @xmath111 , @xmath112 , is described by @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 is the nucleon mass and @xmath116 its energy .    before presenting the formalism to compute the amplitudes for the electroproduction of the delta , one should briefly mention how the radial profiles @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are determined .",
    "they may be determined in the so - called  variation - before - projection \" ( vbp ) method , and , in that case , the stationarity of the mean field energy is required . a better approach ( even if much more demanding numerically ) is the vap (  variation - after - projection \" ) method , where the energy functional to be minimized is the expectation value of the normal ordered hamiltonian in the projected state @xmath117 . in this procedure , which we followed ,",
    "one obtains different field radial profiles @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ( and coherent state amplitudes @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 ) for the nucleon ( @xmath126 ) and for the delta ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the results presented section [ seciv ] use the vap method for the angular momentum projection and the approximate vap method for the linear momentum projection as described in @xcite . unless otherwise stated , the coupling constants are @xmath128 in the lsm @xcite and @xmath129  gev in the cdm  @xcite , for which nucleon properties are well described . these values , together with the above mentioned values for meson masses and pion decay constant , will be referred to as the _ standard _ parameters .",

    "a similar enhancement turns out to show up in the quadrupole electric and coulomb multipoles , and altogether no sensible modification appears in emr and cmr . in the cdm",
    "the modification of @xmath172 due to a better treatment of the kinematics of the nucleon and the delta is not enough to achieve a better comparison with the data .",
    "the comparison with the data of this observable favours the model with large number of pions in the cloud .",
    "the big slope of the theoretical cmr in the cdm is due to the small value predicted for @xmath172 in this model .",
    "the values of the ratios at the photon point ( delta photoproduction ) are @xmath173% ( lsm ) and -2.54% ( cdm ) for the cmr and -2.11% ( lsm ) , -1.85% ( cdm ) for the emr .",

    "it is not our purpose to find fittings of model parameters that better reproduce the experimental results ( model parameters were fixed in the nucleon sector of the models ) .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to analyze the dependence of the results with model parameters namely the coupling constants . as stated before , the physical window for @xmath59 in the cdm is relatively narrow and the resulting radial wave functions are very much similar throughout that physical range .",

    "the same trends were also found in the cdm ( but with even smaller variations with @xmath59 ) .",
