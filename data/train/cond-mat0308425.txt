    "the generic singularity when changing a single control parameter is the @xmath11 also called fold . in the most important situations , it deals with the transition from a liquid , characterized by @xmath12 , to an idealized glass , characterized by @xmath13 .",

    "the appropriate plateau value connected with the @xmath15-singularity is @xmath321 , and close to the plateau for the gel transition @xmath312 . that the plateaus for gel transitions and for the @xmath15-singularity are close for any wave vector is also reflected in the localization lengths in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_var ]  ( a ) .",
    "therefore the logarithmic laws for the @xmath15-singularity have an asymmetric range of applicability .",
    "the range is rather small for shorter times since the gel transition interferes , and considerably larger for longer times as the critical decay due to the glass transition has a more distant plateau .",
    "the evolution of the dynamics when moving from state 1 to state 2 is the analog of the dynamics seen in the msd in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ]  ( b ) .",
    "only a minor part of the slowing down takes place at the gel plateau , the major part from @xmath322 to @xmath323 is described by the logarithmic laws around @xmath324 . for the solutions 1 and 2 , the approximation by the next - to - leading order is valid from @xmath325 to @xmath326 and @xmath327 , respectively . at the @xmath11-singularity for the glass transition , the critical law  ( [ eq : asy : a2crit ] ) is observed .",

    "when taking another path from 1 to state  3 , the distance to the @xmath15-singularity remains largely unaltered and we find the counterpart of fig .",
    "[ fig : asy_fit ] for the msd .",
    "the dynamics is ruled by an approach to the gel transition and the complete decay below @xmath312 is part of the @xmath225-process .",
    "this @xmath225-process for the gel transition scales by a shift along the respective plateau @xmath312 with only minor deviations due to changing separations to the glass - transition line and the @xmath15-singularity .",
    "no clear two - step process is observed for curve  3 for two reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath11-dynamics below @xmath312 is limited by the logarithmic laws for the @xmath15-singularity .",
    "second , the complete decay seen in curve  3 requires more than ten decades , but only for @xmath334 the decay takes place above the plateau @xmath312 .",
    "hence , the decay onto the plateau is too close to the transient dynamics to exhibit a clear critical decay .",
    "moreover , the exponent parameter in the vicinity of the @xmath15-singularity is already rather high , @xmath335 , so the critical law @xmath330 is stretched considerably . as in the msd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asy_fit ] for the last curve , moving closer to the gel transition , the two - step process typical for an @xmath11-singularity reemerges .",
    "the relaxation scenarios for line - crossings near higher - order glass - transition singularities were presented in this work .",
    "three different singularities influence the dynamics in that region of the glass - transition diagram , and asymptotic expansions around each of these are necessary to successfully describe the complete relaxation patterns .",
    "each singularity is associated with a characteristic plateau value as shown for the localization lengths for the msd in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_var ]  a and for the debye - waller factors @xmath149 for @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ fig : chen ] .",
    "the position of the different plateau values arranges the successive steps for the relaxation in time .",
    "the plateau of the gel transition is encountered first .",
    "it is approached by the relaxation with the critical law of the @xmath11-singularity , cf .",
    "[ fig : msd ]  c. the dynamics after crossing the gel plateau is described by the von  schweidler law related to the @xmath11-singularity for the gel transition , cf .",
    "[ fig : asy_fit ] , before the logarithmic laws at the @xmath15-singularity become valid .",
    "the latter have been studied extensively and imply a subdiffusive power law with exponent @xmath281 , cf .",

    "( [ eq : asy : powercorrb2 ] ) vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , for a region near the crossing where @xmath287 , an effective power law with exponent @xmath229 can be identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ]  c. the onset of this behavior is described by the asymptotic dynamics around the @xmath15-singularity while the extension to later times originates from a crossover to the critical dynamics at the plateau of the glass transition , cf .",
    "[ fig : asy_fit ] .",
    "both the asymptotic power law @xcite and the crossover scenario @xcite have been found for the msd in recent computer simulation studies .    a similar crossover which yields the @xmath336-relaxation in the msd is responsible for an effective logarithmic decay in the correlation functions for wave vectors that are accessible in typical light - scattering experiments .",
    "again , the dynamics between the plateau for the @xmath15-singularity and the plateau for the glass transition assumes a variation linear in @xmath337 , cf .",
    "[ fig : chen ] .",
    "most of this behavior is fitted satisfactorily by two different asymptotic laws and is therefore clearly differentiated from the asymptotic logarithmic decay at higher - order singularities which is expected only for large values of the wave vector @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , also the effective logarithmic decay can serve as a clear signature of a line crossing and hence for the existence of higher - order singularities . the decay analyzed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chen ] has been identified as a typical scenario in systems with short - ranged attraction in experiment @xcite , theory @xcite , and computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the last relaxation step of the complete decay in the vicinity of the line crossing occurs at the plateau for the glass transition and is similar to the scenario known from the hss as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ]  a. only after having crossed this last plateau , the dynamics enters the long - time diffusion limit .",
    "each of the relaxation steps discussed above can be more or less pronounced depending on the separation from the related singularity in control - parameter space .",
    "it can be inferred from figs .",
    "[ fig : crit_par ] , [ fig : vs_par ] , and [ fig : delta_var ] that in a certain region around the higher - order singularities , the presence of the latter singularities introduces large corrections to the asymptotic laws at gel- and glass - transition points . outside this region , however , the use of the conventional @xmath11-scenario is justified and the asymptotic approximation varies only little there .",
    "hence , the dynamics near any state on the entire surface of liquid - glass and liquid - gel transitions can be characterized by the parameters of the asymptotic approximations .",
    "the variation of the final long - time diffusion can be used to map the theoretical glass - transition diagram to the experimental control - parameter space and thus locate higher - order glass - transition singularities at least approximately .",
    "the mapping proposed in this work could be used to estimate the location of an @xmath15-singularity in @xcite by extrapolation , cf .",
    "[ fig : iso_all_add ] , and facilitated the identification of an @xmath16-singularity in a recent computer simulation study @xcite . within the percus - yevick approximation for @xmath4 ,",

    "[ fig : a34pymsa ] .",
    "when using the structure factor in mean - spherical approximation , this behavior is different .",
    "but this difference is eliminated after identifying the glass - transition diagrams for both closure relations at the crossing points . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the densities of endpoint and critical point are in accord reasonably , while the higher value for @xmath19 fixes the @xmath15-singularity in the metastable region with respect to the isostructural phase transition .",
    "i thank w.  gtze for valuable discussion .",
