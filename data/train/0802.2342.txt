    "this article is devoted to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms from some selected graphs to quasi - complete graphs ( i.e. , graphs obtained from complete graphs by removing one edge ) .",
    "the source graphs are complete graphs , quasi - complete graphs , paths , cycles , wheels and broken wheels .",
    "we next recall the definitions of graph , of graph homomorphism and of other objects used here in order to develop the notation and to briefly mention what led us into writing this article .",
    "a graph is a finite set of points , called _ vertices _ , along with a set of unordered pairs of distinct vertices , called _",
    "edges_. notation : edge @xmath0 for vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a graph will be denoted by capital letters @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the set of vertices of graph @xmath3 is denoted @xmath5 and the set of edges of @xmath3 is denoted @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , if a pair of vertices of a graph forms an edge , we say that these vertices are _",
    "adjacent_. a homomorphism , @xmath7 , from a graph @xmath3 to a graph",
    "@xmath4 is a map from @xmath5 to @xmath8 which preserves adjacency i.e. , whenever @xmath0 is an edge of @xmath3 , @xmath9 is an edge of @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the set of homomorphisms from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is denoted @xmath10 and its cardinality @xmath11 .",
    "also , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 will denote the cardinality of the bijective homomorphisms , the surjective homomorphisms and the injective homomorphisms of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a fixed sequence of all non - isomorphic graphs .",
    "given a graph @xmath3 , the _ profile _ of @xmath3 ( or _ lovsz vector _ of @xmath3 ) is the sequence of non - negative integers @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "the lovsz vector was introduced in @xcite to prove that graphs with the same lovsz vectors are isomorphic modulo twins .",
    "we use the term _ partial profile _ of a given graph since we only calculate a subsequence ( albeit infinite ) of the @xmath19 s .    for each graph @xmath3 ,",
    "the chromatic polynomial of @xmath3 , @xmath20 , is the number of homomorphisms from @xmath3 to the complete graph , @xmath21 , for each @xmath22 greater than or equal to the chromatic number of @xmath3 , @xmath23 ( @xcite ) . as such ,",
    "all the known chromatic polynomials evaluated at a specific positive integer @xmath22 , provide a partial profile of the complete graph @xmath21 .",
    "we believe that the enumeration of graph homomorphisms to a given graph is an interesting problem in itself to which not much attention has been devoted - except for the chromatic polynomials ( when regarded as noted above ) of a few families of graphs and some other calculations ( @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we take as target graphs the quasi - complete graphs i.e. , graphs obtained from complete graphs by removing one edge .",
    "we enumerate graph homomorphisms to these graphs from some graphs ( complete graphs , quasi - complete graphs , paths , cycles , wheels and broken wheels ) i.e. , we provide formulas for the calculation of the numbers of these homomorphisms in terms of the numbers of vertices of the source and target graphs .",
    "the availability of such formulas may aid in the characterization and/or the identification of graphs , leaning on lovsz result mentioned above ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it may help supporting or providing counter - examples to the reconstruction conjecture ( @xcite ) .",
    "for any integer @xmath24 , we let @xmath21 denote the complete graph on @xmath22 vertices i.e. , the graph on @xmath22 vertices such that any two vertices are adjacent . for any integer @xmath24",
    ", we define the _ quasi - complete graph _ on @xmath22 vertices to be the graph obtained from @xmath21 by removing one edge .",
    "we denote it @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the edge that has been removed in order to obtain it from @xmath21 will be referred to as the _ missing edge_. on the other hand , from the point of view of @xmath21 , we call this edge the _ exceptional edge_. the vertices which make up this edge will be denoted @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in this section",
    "we obtain formulas for calculating the numbers of homomorphisms into quasi - complete graphs from some graphs in terms of the numbers of vertices .",
    "the title of each subsection identifies which class of graphs is being used as source graph .      for integers",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath24 , @xmath29 in particular , @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "proof : homomorphisms from complete graphs to any given graph are one - to - one since any two vertices in a complete graph are adjacent . in this way , if @xmath32 then there are no homomorphisms from @xmath33 to @xmath25 .    if @xmath34 then any one - to - one map from @xmath33 to @xmath25 has to send distinct vertices of @xmath33 to the vertices of the missing edge of @xmath25 thereby mapping adjacent vertices to non - adjacent vertices .",
    "again , there are no homomorphisms in this case .    if @xmath35 then the image of a homomorphism can not contain both vertices of the missing edge as pointed out above .",
    "on the other hand it has to contain at least one of these two vertices , for otherwise there would not be enough vertices in the image .",
    "the problem is then reduced to distribute the @xmath36 vertices of @xmath33 in a one - to - one fashion over the @xmath37 vertices of @xmath25 which contain exactly one of the vertices of the missing edge or over those that contain the other vertex of the missing edge .",
    "this is @xmath38    now for @xmath39 . as in the preceding case",
    ", the image of a homomorphism may contain exactly one vertex of the missing edge . in this case , after fixing one of the vertices from the missing edge , the @xmath36 vertices of @xmath33 are distributed over a subset of @xmath36 vertices from the set of @xmath40 vertices of @xmath25 which contain the selected vertex of the missing edge ( but not the other one ) .",
    "then one of the vertices of @xmath33 has to be mapped to this vertex ( @xmath36 possibilities ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath41 vertices of @xmath33 have to be mapped in a one - to - one fashion to the vertices of @xmath25 but the vertices of the missing edge , to ensure adjacency is preserved ( @xmath42 possibilities ) .",
    "the other vertex of the missing edge is then fixed and the preceding reasoning is repeated yielding @xmath43    since @xmath39 it is still possible to construct homomorphisms whose image do not contain either of the vertices of the missing edge . in this case the @xmath36 vertices of @xmath33 are mapped in a one - to - one fashion to the @xmath44 vertices of @xmath25 , ( except the vertices from the missing edge ) .",
    "@xmath45    clearly , the numbers @xmath46 coincide with the numbers @xmath47 for reasons pointed out above .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 are always zero .",
    "@xmath50      for integers @xmath28 , @xmath24 , @xmath51 also , @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54    proof : we will regard @xmath55 as consisting of @xmath56 formed by vertices @xmath57 and then adjoining vertex @xmath36 making it adjacent to all other vertices but @xmath58 . concerning @xmath25",
    "we will denote the vertices of the missing edge @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "any homomorphism from @xmath55 to @xmath25 has to map the @xmath56 in @xmath55 to a complete subgraph of @xmath25 with @xmath41 vertices .",
    "it follows that if @xmath59 i.e. , if @xmath32 , then @xmath60 .    if @xmath61 then there are two complete subgraphs of @xmath25 with @xmath41 vertices , one containing vertex @xmath26 and the other one containing vertex @xmath27 .",
    "it follows that the image of each homomorphism in this @xmath62 case has to involve at least one of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the homomorphisms that involve both have to map @xmath58 to @xmath26 and @xmath36 to @xmath27 or @xmath58 to @xmath27 and @xmath36 to @xmath26 .",
    "the other @xmath63 vertices are permuted among the @xmath63 vertices of @xmath25 other than @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "so the homomorphisms that involve both @xmath26 and @xmath27 i.e. , the bijective ones , are @xmath64    now for the homomorphisms that involve exactly one of @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath56 of @xmath55 is mapped to either one of the two complete subgraphs of @xmath25 with @xmath41 vertices mentioned above and vertex @xmath36 is mapped to the same vertex @xmath58 is mapped to .",
    "these are @xmath65 .",
    "then , @xmath66    now suppose @xmath67 .",
    "besides homomorphisms involving both @xmath26 and @xmath27 and homomorphisms involving either @xmath26 or @xmath27 ( exclusively ) , there are now homomorphisms which do not involve @xmath26 or @xmath27 .    the ones that involve both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are injective .",
    "also , @xmath58 is mapped to @xmath26 and @xmath36 is mapped to @xmath27 or @xmath58 is mapped to @xmath27 and @xmath36 is mapped to @xmath26 while the remaining @xmath63 vertices are permuted over the @xmath44 vertices of @xmath25 other than @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these are then @xmath68    now for the homomorphisms that involve exactly @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "one of the @xmath36 vertices has to be mapped to @xmath26 ( respect . , @xmath27 , and for this reason there will be an overall @xmath69 factor ) .",
    "consider the vertices @xmath70 forming the @xmath56 in @xmath55 .",
    "one of these is mapped to @xmath26 ( @xmath41 possibilities ) . then the remaining @xmath63 vertices of @xmath56 are distributed over @xmath63 of @xmath44 vertices of @xmath25 ( other than @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "finally , vertex @xmath36 can either be mapped to the vertex @xmath58 has been mapped to or to one of the remaining @xmath71 vertices of @xmath25 ( these latter homomorphisms are injective ) .",
    "if vertex @xmath36 is mapped to @xmath26 , then vertex @xmath58 is not mapped to @xmath26 ( this situation has already been contemplated ) and the remaining @xmath41 vertices of @xmath33 , including vertex @xmath58 , are distributed over the remaining @xmath44 vertices of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath72 the injective homomorphisms among these are @xmath73    finally , those that do not involve @xmath26 nor @xmath27 are @xmath74 where the left summand counts the injective ones of these homomorphisms and the right summand counts the homomorphisms which map @xmath58 and @xmath36 to the same vertex .",
    "then , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77    the proof is concluded .",
