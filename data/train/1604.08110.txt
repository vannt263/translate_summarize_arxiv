    "the predicted dispersion relations of collective modes can be used as a practical tool in experiments to readout a thermodynamic state of a dipolar gas .",

    "for @xmath299 we even observe the onset of dimer crystallization in a wigner lattice .",

    "here the spectral density shows two characteristic maxima .",
    "the first maximum is positioned slightly below the recoil energy @xmath758 and corresponds to the multiexcitation continuum .",
    "the second peak , and the corresponding low - frequency branch beyond the roton wavenumber , has been observed also in a single layer system .",

    "more detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    both methods , the stochastic reconstruction and the method of moments , clearly demonstrate the presence of the gapped optical mode in the non - superfluid / partially superfluid phase of dipolar bosons .",
    "here it is worth to mention the long - standing theoretical issue .",
    "@xcite the effects of interlayer and intralayer correlations , essential for strongly coupled bilayers , have been addressed in stls  @xcite and qlca .",

    "[ fig : m1d1a ] ,  [ fig : m1d55a ] validate that the presence of the gap can be strongly influenced , besides the many - body correlations , also by quantum statistics .",
    "the inlayer superfluidity in bose systems can completely mask the interlayer correlations , which are responsible for formation of the gap , and lead to the acoustic dispersion in the long wavelength limit .",
