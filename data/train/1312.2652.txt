    "the higher dimension vacuum condensates play a less important role . in summary ,",
    "the higher dimension vacuum condensates play an important role in determining the borel windows therefore the ground state masses and pole residues , so we should take them into account consistently .    in this article , we extend our previous works in refs.@xcite to study the @xmath2 type and @xmath3 type axial - vector tetraquark states by calculating the vacuum condensates up to dimension-10 in a systematic way , make reasonable assignments of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 based on the qcd sum rules .",

    "we can insert a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 into the correlation functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 to obtain the hadronic representation @xcite . after isolating the ground state contributions from the axial - vector ( and vector ) tetraquark states , we get the following results , @xmath90 where the spin-0 component @xmath91 and the spin-1 component @xmath92 are irrelevant in the present analysis @xcite , the pole residues @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) are defined by @xmath95 the @xmath96 are the polarization vectors of the axial - vector ( and vector ) tetraquark states .",

    "furthermore , we can take the pole residue as basic input parameter to study the relevant processes with the three - point qcd sum rules , the predictions can also be confronted with the experimental data and shed light on the nature of the special hadron . in the present case , the predicted masses maybe favor or disfavor assigning the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the axial - vector tetraquark states , while the predicted hadronic coupling constants therefore the decay widths serve as additional constraints in assigning the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we carry out the operator product expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension-10 , then obtain the qcd spectral densities through dispersion relation , take the quark - hadron duality below the thresholds @xmath102 , and perform borel transform with respect to the variable @xmath103 to obtain the qcd sum rules : @xmath104 where @xmath105 the subscripts @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 denote the dimensions of the vacuum condensates , the explicit expressions are presented in the appendix",
