    "the mathematical modelling of populations subjected to the competing evolutionary forces of mutation and selection has a long and rich history , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the various approaches that have been employed to describe dna evolution at the molecular level can be classified into two main categories , comprising stochastic approaches on the one hand and deterministic on the other .",
    "the stochastic models deal with finite populations using wright - fisher sampling ( @xcite , ch .  3 ) .",
    "the stochastic formulation lies at the heart of the neutral theory and had a strong influence on the methods used today to analyse population sequence data , see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews .",
    "selection can be treated as well ; however , this is limited to very simple situations with two alleles only .",
    "the analysis of more complicated settings becomes impractical .    in the deterministic formulation ,",
    "more challenging selection schemes can be treated , at the cost of neglecting genetic drift .",
    "classical mutation - selection models formulate differential equations for the evolution of gene frequencies in infinite populations ( @xcite , ch .  6 ; for an up - to - date review see @xcite ) .",
    "these have been adapted to sequence space by identifying alleles with sequences , and choosing an appropriate mutation mechanism  a tradition that was started by @xcite and reviewed by @xcite .",
    "a number of results can be found , e.g. , in @xcite and , in a time - continuous formulation where mutation and selection are decoupled from each other , in @xcite . but",
    "this body of literature almost exclusively deals with two - state models , where each site in the sequence can be occupied with one of two states ( or alleles ) , wildtype or mutant , in the assumption that this captures the essential behaviour of dna sequences which are written in a four - letter alphabet .    in a recent article , @xcite refined this approach to a four - state model within a physical framework , concentrating on linear and quadratic fitness functions .",
    "the results obtained for the four - state model show a much richer behaviour than is observed for the two - state case .",
    "therefore , four - state models clearly deserve further investigation . in this article",
    ", we consider a four - state model for general permutation - invariant fitness functions , formulated entirely within the biological framework .",
    "our main result is a maximum principle that allows us to determine the population mean fitness in mutation - selection balance by maximising the difference between the fitness and a suitably defined function that describes the mutational loss .    in practice",
    ", permutation - invariant fitness means that the fitness only depends on the type and the number of mutations relative to a reference sequence , not on their position in the sequence .",
    "this is , of course , a strong restriction ; however , because of the difficult accessibility and complexity of realistic fitness landscapes , it is a widely used assumption in the population genetics literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . furthermore , a permutation - invariant fitness function describes the accumulation of many small mutational effects surprisingly well .",
    "it is actually a good approximation for the fitness function in some models for concrete experimental situations like the dna - binding models treated by @xcite , which are formulated as two - state models and would certainly profit from a generalisation to a four - state description .",
    "the four - state model of @xcite is a generalisation of the two - state model or biallelic chain @xcite .",
    "mutation - selection models of this type are closely connected to certain models of statistical physics , so - called quantum spin chains .",
    "whereas the biallelic chain is related to the quantum ising chain , the four - state model considered in this article corresponds to the ashkin - teller quantum chain , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , ch .",
    "however , this correspondence does not mean that results from statistical physics can be transferred directly to biology , because some of the quantities considered in the context of statistical physics are not those that are of interest here , compare the discussion by @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start with a general introduction to mutation - selection models , defining the ancestral distribution and the observable quantities in this class of models .",
    "this is then specialised to the sequence space of the four - state model which we are interested in , choosing appropriate models for mutation and selection . exploiting the permutation invariance of the fitness function and the symmetries of the mutation model",
    ", the sequence space can be reduced to the permutation - invariant subspace .",
    "subsequently , we define the mutational loss function and state the maximum principle .",
    "this principle holds exactly in three special cases which we discuss in detail .",
    "finally , this is followed by a summary and a brief outlook .",
    "the rather technical proofs of the maximum principle are given in two appendices .",
    "we consider a population of haploid individuals whose genotypes are chosen from a sequence space , a set of a finite number @xmath0 of possible genotypes @xmath1 .",
    "the population is described by the population distribution @xmath2 , a @xmath0-dimensional vector with entries @xmath3 , indicating the relative frequency of type @xmath1 in the population .",
    "hence , @xmath2 has to be normalised such that @xmath4 . for finite population size ,",
    "the @xmath5 are rational numbers . in this article , we concentrate on the deterministic limit of an infinite population size , where the relative frequencies can take real values .    ignoring environmental effects ,",
    "mutation and selection are assumed to depend only on the genotypes of individuals . in this framework ,",
    "the evolutionary processes to be considered are birth and death of individuals , and mutation from one type to another .    in the time - continuous model ,",
    "each individual of type @xmath1 gives birth to an identical copy with a rate @xmath6 and dies with a rate @xmath7 , hence we have an effective reproduction rate @xmath8 , also called the _ malthusian fitness _ ( @xcite , ch .  1 ) .",
    "these values are collected in a diagonal _ reproduction matrix _ @xmath9 .",
    "mutation from type @xmath10 to @xmath1 occurs with a rate @xmath11 . to preserve the normalisation of the population distribution @xmath2 , the diagonal entries @xmath12 of the _ mutation matrix",
    "@xmath13 are chosen such that @xmath14 has a vanishing sum over the columns , @xmath15 , which makes @xmath14 a markov generator . unless we talk about unidirectional mutation ( cf .",
    "[ unidirectional mutation ] ) , we will assume that the mutation matrix is irreducible , i.e. , each genotype can be reached from any other by mutation , possibly in several steps . with the definition of the _ time - evolution operator _ @xmath16",
    ", this leads to the evolution equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the _ population mean fitness _ @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the @xmath21 identity matrix , cf .",
    "@xcite , ch .  6 , and @xcite , ch .  3 .",
    "irreducibility of @xmath14 implies that of @xmath22 , and the perron - frobenius ( pf ) theorem guarantees that there exists a unique stable equilibrium solution , which is given by the strictly positive eigenvector @xmath2 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath23 of @xmath22 , @xmath24 in the limit as @xmath25 , the population distribution converges towards this equilibrium solution , @xmath26 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the equilibrium solutions @xmath27 . in this case , eq .  ( [ 2.1 ] ) becomes an eigenvalue equation for @xmath22 with eigenvalue @xmath28 .",
    "the _ right _ pf eigenvector @xmath2 is the population distribution in equilibrium , whereas the entries @xmath29 of the _ left _ pf eigenvector @xmath30 determine the relative reproductive success of type-@xmath1 individuals , as shown by @xcite . the _ ancestral distribution _",
    ", also introduced by @xcite , is a probability distribution defined as @xmath31 , with the normalisation of @xmath30 chosen such that @xmath32 . here",
    ", @xmath33 specifies the fraction of the equilibrium population whose ancestors , an infinitely long time ago , were of type @xmath1 .    in analogy to the way that the population distribution is defined as a time - dependent quantity , this can also be done for the relative reproductive success @xmath30 and the ancestral distribution @xmath34 . however , this demands some notational efforts , and as we do not need this property later on , we limit ourselves to the definition of the ancestral distribution as an equilibrium quantity .",
    "a population is macroscopically described by mean quantities .",
    "we introduced two probability distributions , hence there are two types of averages that are relevant in our model .",
    "every mapping @xmath35 that assigns a value @xmath36 to each possible genotype @xmath1 can be averaged with respect to the population distribution or the ancestral distribution .",
    "the _ population mean _ of @xmath35 , denoted by @xmath37 , is given by @xmath38 the population mean in equilibrium , i.e. , in the limit as @xmath25 , is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "the _ ancestral mean _ of an operator @xmath35 , denoted by @xmath40 , is defined as @xmath41 note that the ancestral mean does not depend on time , as we defined the ancestral distribution as an equilibrium quantity only .",
    "the genetic information is coded in the dna as a string composed of the purines adenine and guanine ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) and the pyrimidines cytosine and thymine ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) .",
    "we consider dna strands of fixed length @xmath46 , which may , for instance , code for an enzyme , as modelled by @xcite .",
    "the four basic states @xmath47 are mapped onto @xmath48 , or , as it is done by @xcite , onto @xmath49 .",
    "conveniently , one can exploit the freedom in the choice of this mapping by introducing a relative rather than an absolute mapping between the bases @xmath47 and the symbols @xmath48 .",
    "this essentially means that one can choose independent mappings at each position along the dna strand . at any position",
    ", the mapping can be defined such that the symbol @xmath50 , or @xmath51 , corresponds to the corresponding base in a given preferred sequence , which is usually chosen to be the _ wildtype _ or _",
    "master sequence _ of maximal fitness @xmath52 .",
    "thus the wildtype sequence is mapped onto the sequence @xmath53 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the mapping between the remaining nucleotides and the symbols @xmath54 will be discussed below .",
    "the sequence space consists of all possible @xmath46-letter sequences in these four symbols , so it is given by @xmath55 and has dimension @xmath56 .    in what follows",
    ", we shall not really need the complete information about the sequences .",
    "it will be sufficient to characterise a sequence by its _",
    "mutational distance _ with respect to the wildtype sequence @xmath57 , which just counts the deviations from the wildtype sequence .",
    "whereas in the two - state model the mutational distance is given by a single integer , which counts the number of bases along the dna strand that differ from those in the wildtype , we now need three non - negative integers @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , according to the different types of mutations that can occur .",
    "we define the mutational distance @xmath61 of a sequence as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the number of entries @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the sequence , respectively .",
    "the total mutational distance is defined as the sum @xmath69 , which takes values @xmath70 .",
    "mutation is taken to be a point process that acts at each site independently . disregarding more complicated mechanisms such as deletions and insertions , we only take into account the replacement of one base by another .",
    "taken over the whole sequence , this happens with certain rates @xmath71 , where @xmath72 indicates the type of replacement .",
    "we allow only one mutation at a time , as modelled by a poisson process .",
    "this leads to a single step mutation model , which was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "we work with the _ kimura 3st mutation scheme _ shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( @xcite , ch.13 ) which assumes that , of a possible 12 mutation rates that can be chosen in our setting , only three different mutation rates @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 occur .",
    "in particular , forward and backward mutation rates are the same , and the mutation process respects a symmetry between exchanges of purines and pyrimidines .",

    "this case is known as the _ jukes - cantor mutation scheme _ @xcite .    due to the similar shapes of the nucleotides , _ transitions _ , i.e. , the replacement of one purin/ pyrimidine by the other , are more frequent than _ transversions _ ,",
    "i.e. , the replacement of a purin/ pyrimidine by a pyrimidine / purin . the mutation rates describing the transversions are fairly similar , so @xmath80 , whereas the mutation rate for the transitions @xmath77 is typically larger by a factor of about @xmath67 to @xmath81 .",
    "this is taken into account in the _ kimura 2 parameter model _ @xcite by assuming that @xmath82 .",
    "assume there is one particular sequence @xmath83 with maximal fitness @xmath52 , the wildtype or master sequence , which is mapped onto @xmath57 . for any other sequence , the corresponding representation in terms of the symbols @xmath48",

    "realistic fitness landscapes would be rather rugged and strongly dependent on the function of the dna sequence , but they are hard to access experimentally .",
    "we shall use the severe simplification of a permutation - invariant fitness function , which is nevertheless a rather common ( and usually implicitly made ) assumption in theoretical investigations of mutation - selection models such as @xcite as well as in the modelling of concrete experimental settings like in dna - binding models @xcite . using permutation - invariant fitness",
    ", one assumes that the fitness of a sequence depends only on the _ number _ of mutations of the various kinds , _ not _ on their location within the sequence .",
    "hence , we can describe a sequence completely by its mutational distance @xmath91 with respect to the wildtype sequence .",
    "as there are @xmath56 different sequences , but only @xmath92 different distances @xmath61 with @xmath93 , this reduces the effective type space enormously . in the permutation - invariant fitness model , the number of possible different genotypes , and thus the dimension of the permutation - invariant subspace , is given by @xmath94",
    "in our model , three different spaces are relevant : ( i ) the @xmath56-dimensional full sequence space , ( ii ) the reduced sequence space of dimension @xmath0 , and ( iii ) the three - dimensional space of the mutational distances .    in the _ full sequence space _ of dimension @xmath56 , each sequence corresponds to a different basis vector , and the population @xmath2 is then completely determined as a point on the @xmath95-dimensional hyperplane defined by @xmath96 , where the projection on each axis gives the frequency @xmath5 of the corresponding sequence .",
    "analogously , the @xmath0-dimensional _ reduced sequence space _ , which is the permutation - invariant subspace of the full sequence space , is spanned by unit vectors , each of which corresponds to the set of all sequences which have the same number of mutations of each type , i.e. , to one of the @xmath0 different mutational distances @xmath61 . here",
    ", the population @xmath2 is also given as a point on a hyperplane ( of dimension @xmath97 ) .",
    "in general , the transition from the full to the reduced sequence space is accompanied by a loss of information . as long as we consider systems with a unique equilibrium population , we know that this equilibrium will be permutation - invariant , because starting from a permutation - invariant initial population , we will reach a permutation - invariant equilibrium because the fitness function , as well as the mutation scheme , disregard the order in the sequences .",
    "as the equilibrium is unique , it will be reached from any initial condition .",
    "therefore , sequences with the same numbers of each type of mutation , i.e. , the same @xmath61 , must occur with the same frequency in the equilibrium population .",
    "thus , as long as we are only interested in equilibrium properties of systems with a unique equilibrium , it suffices to restrict ourselves to the reduced sequence space .    finally , we have the three - dimension _ mutational distance space _ of the mutational distance vectors @xmath61 with cartesian coordinates @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . the basis of this space is formed by the cartesian unit vectors",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which are the basic directions of mutation .",
    "the condition @xmath104 restricts the possible mutational distance vectors @xmath61 to a simplex in the positive quadrant , as shown in fig .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the sequences in the reduced sequence space and the mutational distance vectors @xmath61 in this simplex , and we label the elements of the reduced sequence space by the corresponding mutational distance vectors @xmath61 .",
    "whenever we speak of a sequence @xmath61 , we refer to the corresponding sequences in the reduced sequence space .",
    "the mutational distance space is required to define the neighbourhood of sequences . as we use a single step mutation model , each sequence , now labelled by @xmath61 ,",
    "has at most 12 neighbours , i.e. , sequences to which they can mutate within a single mutation step .",
    "the neighbours of a sequence @xmath61 have mutational distances @xmath105 , where @xmath106 determines the direction of mutation and the @xmath107 are combinations of the basis vectors @xmath108 .",
    "more precisely , there are two types of mutational directions @xmath106 ; firstly , the mutations from wildtype to mutant , @xmath109 with @xmath110 , which correspond to unit vectors @xmath111 , and vice versa , which correspond to @xmath112 . for the second type , where one type of mutation is replaced by another mutation , one mutation step corresponds to a vector @xmath113 .",
    "these directions are labelled by pairs @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and the corresponding mutations in the inverse directions are labelled accordingly with @xmath117 . finally , we note that points on the surface of the simplex in mutational distance space have fewer neighbours .",
    "clearly , only those mutations that do not leave the simplex are permitted .",
    "we exploit the permutation invariance of the fitness function to reduce the sequence space to its relevant permutation - invariant subspace .",
    "therefore , we transform our time - evolution operator @xmath22 , which is a @xmath118-matrix , to a matrix @xmath119 of dimension @xmath94 that describes the reduced sequence space only , the subscript `` piv '' refers to the * p*ermutation-*i*n*v*ariant subspace .",
    "this is done by the means of a similarity transformation @xmath120 .",
    "we have @xmath121 where @xmath119 is the @xmath0-dimensional time - evolution operator describing the reduced sequence space .",
    "a condition on the transformation @xmath120 is that it preserves the markov property of the mutation matrix @xmath14 .",
    "hence , it must be an @xmath122-transformation , which is guaranteed by the property @xmath123 .",
    "for the relevant permutation - invariant subspace , we need to combine all sequences that belong to the same mutational distance vector @xmath61 .",

    "<S> we study the equilibrium behaviour of a deterministic four - state mutation - selection model as a model for the evolution of a population of nucleotide sequences in sequence space . </S>",
    "<S> the mutation model is the kimura 3st mutation scheme , and the selection scheme is assumed to be invariant under permutation of sites . considering the evolution process both forward and backward in time </S>",
    "<S> , we use the ancestral distribution as the stationary state of the backward process to derive an expression for the mutational loss ( as the difference between ancestral and population mean fitness ) , and we prove a maximum principle that determines the population mean fitness in mutation - selection balance . </S>"
