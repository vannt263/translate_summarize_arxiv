    "since the discovery of the broad iron  k line twenty years ago @xcite , there has been debate as to the origin of this distinctive spectral feature .",
    "two physical interpretations fit the time - integrated energy spectrum equally well : relativistic reflection , where the iron  k@xmath0 emission line is produced in the inner accretion disc and is asymmetrically broadened due to special and general relativistic effects in the strong potential well of the central supermassive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and partial covering absorption , where the primary emission is partially covered by distant clumpy clouds or outflowing winds , and this absorption pattern mimics the shape of the broad iron line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this debate comes to a head in the spectral fitting of narrow - line seyfert i galaxy , 1h0707 - 495 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the time - integrated spectrum shows a dramatic drop in flux at 7  kev @xcite , which suggests in both the relativistic reflection model @xcite and the partial covering model @xcite that there is an overabundance of iron in the emitting / absorbing material ( unless the absorbing material is outflowing with velocity @xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of relativistic reflection ,",
    "overabundant iron leads to a strong prediction : the broadened iron  l emission line at @xmath3  kev .",
    "@xcite showed in a 500  ks _ xmm - newton _ that the residuals to a phenomenological continuum model show both the broadened iron  k and iron  l emission lines . in response , @xcite claim that these data can be well - fit by a partial covering by a compton thin absorber that envelops a compton thick absorber , however the major features in the spectrum ( namely the iron - l and iron - k features ) are fitted by ad - hoc absorption edges .",
    "they say : `` in addition to the cold / thick and hot / thin absorbers that respectively explain the iron k- and l- edges , we had to introduce the _ ad - hoc _ edge components to explain the extremely strong edge features . ''",
    "@xcite do not discuss the implications of adding the edges on the rest of the spectral model , nor do they discuss why the iron - l and iron - k edge energies vary independently if they are part of the same absorbing structure .",
    "the high - resolution _ xmm - newton_-rgs data were also examined , and @xcite found no evidence for the narrow emission or absorption lines expected from a partial covering model .    fortunately , 1h0707 - 495 , in addition to its striking spectral features , is also one of the most highly variable seyfert galaxies , commonly known to increase by an order of magnitude in flux on timescales as short as one hour .",
    "this allows for extensive spectral - timing analysis , which can help break the degeneracies of traditional spectral modelling .",
    "in addition to revealing the iron  l feature in the soft excess , @xcite and @xcite showed that the high - frequency variations in the soft excess from 0.31  kev lag behind those in the 14  kev band by @xmath4  s. these authors interpreted this short timescale lag as the reverberation time delay between the primary - emitting corona and the inner accretion disc . this short time delay would put the corona at a height of @xmath5 from the accretion disc ( using the black hole mass estimate of @xmath6 from the @xmath7x - ray excess - variance relation ; * ? ? ? * ) . later , as predicted by the relativistic reflection model , a short timescale lag was also found in the iron  k band using a total of 1.3  ms of archival _ xmm - newton _",
    "data on the source @xcite .",
    "this timing analysis showed that the high - frequency variability in the soft excess is correlated with that of the iron  k band , and that both of these bands lag behind the 13  kev band by tens of seconds .",
    "in other words , the energy spectrum of the high - frequency lags resembles the relativistic reflection energy spectrum . to date , the simultaneous soft excess and iron  k lag has not been explained with a partial covering model .",
    "@xcite and ( and later * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar source ark  564 ) presented a partial covering timing model in which longer , low - frequency lags were interpreted as reverberation between a compact continuum source and distant circumnuclear material . in this model , the amplitude of the low - frequency lag increases with energy because the continuum photons travel through a medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy , and therefore the fraction of scattered photons increases with energy .",
    "we note that this partial covering model requires the corona to be compact because the high - frequency variability must be intrinsic to the primary emission . in this model ,",
    "the high - frequency time lags are simply a phase - wrapping artefact from the low - frequency lags .",
    "if this is the case , then the high - frequency lags would be a mirror - image of the low - frequency lags ( just with a smaller amplitude ) , however , as discussed in the previous paragraph , the high - frequency lags show a distinct signature in the iron  k band ( for more detail , see @xcite ; @xcite , and a complimentary argument based on lag measurements of ngc  6814 in @xcite ) .",
    "the high - frequency iron  k lag has now been well - established in a number of source ( e.g. @xcite , and see @xcite for a review ) . _ until partial covering can explain both the high- and low - frequency spectral - timing results that have now been widely observed , it can not be considered a viable physical model . _        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xcite recently presented an alteration to the reverberation lags in 1h0707 - 495 , in which reverberation off the accretion flow around a non - spinning black hole is diluted by an occulting failed wind at @xmath8 .",
    "this model does require inner disc reflection , but the reflection fraction is very low because there is no emission from within @xmath9 or more .",
    "the authors do not explain the strong , very broad iron  k lag that is present in this source and many others .    despite the extraordinary spectral features and variability patterns of 1h0707 - 495 ,",
    "it is a relatively faint source with a very steep spectrum , which means that it has never been detected above 10  kev until now ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ or _ nustar",
    "_ @xcite has the ability to make this detection because it carries the first high - energy focusing x - ray telescope in orbit , and is 100 times more sensitive than previous instruments in the 1080  kev band . above 10  kev",
    ", photons are not photoelectrically absorbed and reprocessed .",
    "rather they compton downscatter , which produces an excess of photons in the 1080  kev range .",
    "we call this hard excess the compton ` hump ' , and it has been confirmed by _ nustar _ in a number of objects , including ngc  1365 @xcite , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , and mrk  335 @xcite .",
    "_ nustar _ even detects the associated high - frequency compton hump reverberation lag in the bright sources , mcg-5 - 23 - 16 @xcite and swift  j2127.4 + 5654 @xcite , which confirms that the variability in the iron  k and compton hump bands are correlated , and that they lag behind the continuum by short time delays .",
    "this time delay corresponds to light travel distances of @xmath5 .",
    "we present the first results of the _ nustar _ observation of 1h0707 - 495 , which clearly reveals the sharp drop above 6.4  kev and compton hump .",
    "given the recent evidence from _",
    "nustar _ observations and reverberation measurements that support the relativistic reflection interpretation , we will focus on that model for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we fit the spectrum with a relativistic reflection model in order to explore the consequences of including the high - energy emission and to check that the model works .",
    "we do not make attempts to fit the spectrum with a partial covering model , as it is not the aim of this paper to determine which model is correct based on the _ nustar _ spectrum alone .",
    "the paper is outlined as followed : in section  [ obs_sec ] we describe the new observations , and we present the spectral results in section  [ results ] .",
    "we find that the energy of the blue wing of the iron line is dependent on flux in this source , and discuss possible reasons and implications for this observation in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ conclude ] .",

    "the spectrum can be well described using the publicly available relxilllp , which combines the xillver reflection grid @xcite with the relconv_lp relativistic convolution kernel for a point source corona above an accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the benefit of the lamppost model is that it returns a physical height to the corona and calculates the emissivity profile consistently from the source height , rather than assuming a powerlaw or broken powerlaw emissivity profile .",
    "we emphasize that the lamppost geometry is an extreme simplification of the corona , which is likely to be compact , but obviously not a point source .",
    "we allow for the reflection fraction ( ratio of the reflected to primary emission , @xmath16 ) to vary because the self consistent reflection fraction from a point source corona will always over predict the true reflection fraction from a slightly extended corona .",

    "no clear narrow features are observed in the _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn or rgs data , though , of course , this non - detection does not rule out the possibility of the specific geometry of multiple absorbers along our line that reabsorb all the scattered emission .",
    "the other interpretation explored to explain the shifting blue wing was changes in the coronal height in the relativistic reflection model .",
    "if in the low - flux state , the x - ray emitting source is compact and the source height is small , then only a small portion of the accretion disc will be irradiated due to strong gravitational light bending effects , and the observer will see mostly the gravitationally redshifted emission . the flux increase can be explained as an increase in the coronal source height , which then causes larger radii to be irradiated .",
    "this produces emission that is not gravitationally redshifted .",
    "in addition to light bending effects , the structure of the disc itself could play a role in enhancing the gravitationally - redshifted emission at low flux levels . in a standard shakura & sunyaev accretion disc near its eddington limit , the scale height of the disc far from the innermost stable circular orbit can be as large as @xmath119 .",
    "if the coronal source height is less than @xmath120 , then , at medium inclinations , it would be eclipsed by the large scale height disc at larger radii .",
    "the eclipse of the primary emission would cause the reflection fraction to increase , as we would still observe reflected emission from the far side of the disc ( which is not eclipsed ) .",
    "in this model , when the source height is higher , it will not be eclipsed and so the observed flux increases .",
    "the large source height means that larger portions of the disc are irradiated , and the line centroid is clearly detected .",
    "both light bending and the disc eclipse would have the effect of steepening the emissivity profile with decreasing flux .",
    "similar affects have been found for the evolution of the emissivity break radius with flux in 1h0707 - 495 @xcite , and the steepening of the inner emissivity index with increasing reflection fraction in the ` twin ' to 1h0707 - 495 , iras  13224 - 3809 @xcite .",
    "the two highest flux observations do not agree with the trend of increasing edge energy with flux .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the corona is more vertically extended in the high flux observations than in the ones below @xmath118 erg  @xmath61  s@xmath21 .",
    "while more photons can escape the gravitational pull of the central black hole , there is still a significant portion of the continuum that is irradiating the innermost regions of the disc . the fact that we also see this turnover at high fluxes for the photon index is also expected if the corona is more extended .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we showed that the energy spectrum of the high - frequency variability is harder than that of the low - frequency variability , suggesting that the corona emits a harder continuum at smaller radii .",
    "x - ray microlensing in quasars from @xcite also show that the harder x - ray emission originates from smaller radii than the soft emission .",
    "the spectral hardening of the two highest flux observations would then suggest that some fraction of the coronal emission in these two observations is produced at small radii .",
    "we have not fit the archival _ xmm - newton _ observations with an extended corona , and therefore we can not quantify the extent .",
    "however @xcite has suggested through ray - tracing simulations of an extended corona , that 1h0707 - 495 is extended out to 20 - 30  @xmath32 , though most of the reflected emission comes from within @xmath120 .",
    "we also explore the effects of ionization on the broad line , but find that this is likely not the dominant effect .",
    "as the ionization increases , there are k@xmath0 transitions from more fe ions , and we see emission from the h- and he- like ions ( fe xxv - xxvi ) up to @xmath121  kev .",
    "this effect is only appreciable when the ionization parameter is high ( above log(@xmath45 ) @xmath122 ) .",
    "our spectral fitting shows that the ionization increases with decreasing flux ( consistent with stronger light bending in the low - flux state ) . if ionization changes were driving the change in edge energy",
    ", then we would expect the opposite correlation with flux .",
    "lastly , changes in disc inclination would also change the blue wing of the iron line , but this is not likely to be the cause .",
    "if the disc were precessing , then the edge of the wing would decrease with increasing flux . in the precessing disc model , as the inclination of the disc becomes smaller(more face - on ) , we see a higher flux because of the solid angle increase .",
    "however , this would also decrease the doppler boosting effects , and so the line would appear to be less broad ( i.e. the energy of the blue wing of the line would decrease ) . furthermore , the second and third _ nustar _ observations were taken days apart from each other , and the disc is unlikely to change on such short timescales .",
    "the variable blue wing energy complicates our spectral modelling .",
    "if the changing emissivity profile affects the energy of the blue wing of the line , then we can not use the blue wing as a clear indicator of the inclination of the accretion disc .",
    "usually , the blue wing energy is constant because it is determined by how much doppler shifting is occurring .",
    "therefore , it is likely that by fitting the _ nustar _",
    "data alone , we are inferring a lower disc inclination because it appears that there is less doppler broadening .    in order to account for this variable blue wing in our spectral modelling ,",
    "we fit the _ nustar _ observations with the same relxilllp model , but this time freeze the inclination to 55.7 degrees .",
    "this is the inclination found in @xcite from fitting a relativistic reflection model to 500  ks of _ xmm - newton _ data when the 310  kev flux was @xmath123 erg  @xmath61  s@xmath21 . for this test ,",
    "we take 55.7 degrees to be the ` true ' inclination , and use it to fit the recent _ nustar _ spectra .",
    "this model gives a good fit , @xmath59 = 265/230 = 1.15 , and other parameters change slightly to account for this @xmath124 degree difference in inclination .",
    "the effect of increasing the inclination is generally to decrease the height of the source .",
    "this , in return , increases the ionization and possibly the reflection fraction , which is to be expected as stronger gravitational light bending occurs when the source is lower . when the inclination is fixed at 55.7 degrees , the height is more tightly constrained to be even lower , @xmath125 .",
    "the ionization increases to log@xmath126  erg cm s@xmath21 , and the reflection fraction is constrained to be slightly higher , @xmath127 .",
    "all other parameters remain largely the same .",
    "the spin is still high , @xmath128 , and the iron abundance is still high @xmath129 .    we can track the changes in the energy of the blue wing of the iron line in 1h0707 - 495 because it has been observed for several years in many different flux states , but in addition to the impressive coverage , 1h0707 - 495 is special because it has a high iron abundance , which makes it easier to measure the iron features .",
    "the question of the high iron abundance in 1h0707 - 495 has long been a criticism of the reflection modelling in this source .",
    "our new observations also require a high iron abundance .",
    "in fact , if we ignore the _ nustar _",
    "data below 7.5 kev ( i.e. below the iron line ) and fit the high energy spectrum , we find that the fit requires an iron abundance greater than @xmath130 times solar abundance at the 68% significance . while this is not extremely over - abundant or highly significant , it does suggest that the high iron abundance is not motivated by the iron  k edge alone , but also by the amount of photoelectric absorption in the 813  kev band .",
    "we have presented the spectral analysis of the first _ nustar _ observations 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "our main findings are :    * _ nustar _ confirms a strong drop in flux at the iron  k band , and observes the compton hump in this object for the first time .",
    "* the _ nustar _ observations were taken when the source was at a relatively low - flux . the lowest flux observation ( obs  2 )",
    ", appears to be at an extreme low - flux state . * the three _",
    "observations can be well fitted by a relxilllp model with high spin and a high iron abundance .",
    "the iron abundance derived from just fitting above 7.5  kev also suggests a super - solar iron abundance with 68% significance .",
    "* the lowest flux observation , obs  2 , can be well fit with the extreme low - flux _ xmm - newton _ observation with a model of relativistic reflection off a patchy ( non - uniform density ) disc .",
    "* the energy of the blue wing appears to change with flux in this source .",
    "the mostly likely explanation for this dependence on flux is that at low fluxes , the coronal source height is lower , and therefore we observe the more gravitationally redshifted emission at lower flux .",
    "if we assume that the ` true ' inclination is the one found when the source was in a high - flux state and fit our _ nustar _ spectrum again fixing the inclination to a higher value , then the source height for our new observations is constrained to be less than @xmath125 .",
