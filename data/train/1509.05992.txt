    "in this work we continue our study of a system composed of an anderson impurity @xmath3 immersed in a 3d topological insulator ( 3dti ) with an  inverted - mexican - hat \" band dispersion around the @xmath4-point @xcite . for",
    "the sake of self - consistency let us very briefly recapitulate the peculiar feature of the pertinent system : due to the special band structure , the ensuing kondo effect ( ke ) is profoundly distinct from its metallic analog in normal metals , because in addition to the original anderson impurity @xmath3 , there is an in - gap bound state ( henceforth denoted as an @xmath5 impurity ) , that is formed as a result of potential scattering@xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath5 impurities form a  composite quantum impurity \" ( cqi ) that turns the pertinent kondo physics much richer .",
    "the reason for that is as follows : when isolated , the cqi can host two electrons that are found in singlet or triplet states with corresponding energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 . due to hybridization of the localized electrons in the cqi with the band electrons ,",
    "the levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 are renormalized with decreasing bandwidth _ albeit with different rates _ @xcite . as a result ,",
    "there is either a self - screened ke , or a ke with so(3 ) or so(4 ) dynamical symmetry ( depending on whether at the end of renormalization , @xmath7 lies above , below or coincides with @xmath6 @xcite .    in our previous work@xcite ,",
    "we have analyzed the pertinent kondo physics _ in the weak coupling regime _ using perturbative rg analysis techniques .",
    "the goal of the present work is to perform an analysis of the kondo scattering with so(3 ) and so(4 ) dynamical symmetry in the _ strong coupling regime _ @xmath8 .",
    "the main physical motivation is to elucidate the occurrence of singular fermi liquid in the so(3 ) symmetric sector , that is exposed _ only in the strong coupling regime_. more than a decade ago it has been shown that the traditional classification of quantum impurity models into fermi liquids and non fermi liquids should be modified in such a way that one has to distinguish between regular fermi liquids and singular fermi liquids ( sfl)@xcite . the former case is exemplified by the standard su(2 ) kondo model where electrons are scattered from a magnetic impurity of spin @xmath9 and at zero temperature the impurity is _",
    "fully screened_. this makes it possible to describe the system in terms of nozires fermi - liquid picture . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the impurity is _ under - screened _ , the corresponding fermi liquid is singular .",
    "practically , it implies that the density of states is ( logarithmically ) singular at the fermi energy .    as is already stressed",
    ", this manifestation of sfl occurs only at low temperature @xmath8 , and that requires the calculations to be carried out in the strong coupling regime , where perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "one need to resort to other approaches , such as bethe ansatz or conformal field theory ( cft , that is employed here ) . calculated experimental observables for so(3 ) and so(4 ) symmetric kondo effect include the impurity contribution to the temperature dependence of the specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and resistivity . comparing these results with those of the standard su(2 ) kondo effect",
    ", we indeed elucidate the remarkable sfl nature of the ke for the so(3 ) symmetric sector .",
    "experimentally , under - screened kondo effect ( uske ) has been observed in tunneling transport measurements through molecular transistors @xcite .",
    "it is shown therein that the tunneling conductance @xmath10 approaches the unitary limit when the temperature @xmath0 tends to zero , but the derivative @xmath11 is divergent .",
    "the possibility of detecting uske in kondo scattering in the bulk of metals is hampered by the fact that quantum impurities with high spin give rise to coqblin - schrieffer type of kondo scattering which eventually flows to a regular fermi liquid fixed point @xcite . in this work",
    "we overcome this obstacle and demonstrate the feasibility of observing uske in bulk materials employing the occurrence of composite impurities .",
    "the organization of the paper is facilitated by the fact that the model and the relevant starting kondo hamiltonian as well as the kondo temperature have already been derived in our previous work ( starting from the single impurity anderson hamiltonian ) .",
    "therefore , in sec . [ sec - hk ]",
    "we start right away by writing down the kondo hamiltonian @xmath12 describing low - energy exchange scattering of the band electrons by the @xmath3 and @xmath5 impurities as well as an exchange interactions between the @xmath3 and @xmath5 impurities .",

    "as it is shown in our previous work @xcite , the lowest - energy states of the isolated cqi are the singlet and triplet states with one electron on the @xmath3-level and a second electron on the @xmath5-level .",
    "electron tunneling between the @xmath3-level and the band modifies the number of electrons in the cqi .",
    "integrating out high energy states from the band edges renormalizes the singlet and triplet levels until charge fluctuations are quenched and one arrives at the local moment regime . in this regime ,",

    "notice that , generally , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the low - energy physics of the model depends on @xmath32 .",
    "more concretely , there are three different regimes for @xmath32 determining the different ground states ( gs ) @xcite :    * when @xmath42 , the impurities are decoupled , and kondo scattering of the band electrons is determined mostly by the hybridization of the @xmath3-impurity with the band , whereas the @xmath5-impurity can be considered as an isolated magnetic moment ( i.e. , it is not coupled to the band or to the @xmath3-impurity ) . in this case",
    ", there is standard kondo effect with full screening of the spin of the @xmath3-impurity .",
    "the exchange interaction of the @xmath5-impurity with the band manifests itself just at temperature below kondo temperature .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 enters into consideration only for temperatures below the kondo temperature .",
    "* when @xmath43 with @xmath44 , the ground state of the cqi is a triplet and the singlet state is highly excited . in this case",
    ", band electrons are scattered from a cqi with spin @xmath45 , and there is an uske of the magnetic impurity .",
    "since the magnetic moments of the @xmath3- and @xmath5-impurities in the triplet ground state are parallel to one another , the exchange interaction strength @xmath31 of the @xmath5-impurity with the lead gives rise to slight modification of @xmath46 @xcite , ( that is the exchange interaction strength of the @xmath3 impurity with the band electrons ) .",
