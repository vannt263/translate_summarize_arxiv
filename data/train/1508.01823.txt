    "this implies that @xmath116 is equal to @xmath117 the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath118 . as a consequence of work by lascoux and schtzenberger  @xcite , and",
    "as proven bijectively by edelman and greene  @xcite , stanley symmetric functions are schur positive , i.e. , can be expressed as positive integer sums of schur functions .",
    "since involution stanley symmetric functions are sums of stanley symmetric functions , they inherit this property . in the geometric cases ,",
    "we characterize the involutions whose involution stanley symmetric function is a single schur function . moreover ,",
    "by carefully studying the stabilization of certain weakly dominant involution schubert polynomials , we obtain expressions for the corresponding involution stanley symmetric functions .",

    "our proof of theorem  [ t : wyseryong ] proceeds by generalizing a characterization of schubert polynomials to the involution setting .",
    "this allows us to show our formula coincides with wyser and yong s formula for the class of a point and behaves in the same way with respect to divided difference operators .",
