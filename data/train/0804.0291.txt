    "cataclysmic variables are semi - detached binary systems in which a red dwarf secondary loses material through the inner lagrangian point into an accretion disc , ring or accretion column around the white dwarf primary .",
    "the secondary stars in cataclysmic variables are challenging targets to study because their spectrum is heavily veiled by the strong blue continuum of the accretion disc . since the donor star is an important piece in the understanding of these interacting binaries , it is paramount to make detailed and high quality spectroscopic studies of their secondary stars .",
    "ae aquarii is an 11 - 12 mag cataclysmic variable , which was discovered in the optical by zinner ( 1938 ) .",
    "it is located at about 100 pc ( friedjung  1997 ) and was first associated with the dq  her or _ intermediate polar _",
    "stars by patterson  ( 1979 ) .",
    "its binary nature was discovered by joy  ( 1954 ) , who found this system to be consistent with a small hot star and a late - type companion of spectral type dk0 , with an orbital period of about 16.84 hr . a corrected period , of around 9.88 hr ,",
    "was obtained later by walker ( 1965 ) . since ae  aqr is not an eclipsing system , its inclination angle is not well determined , but it is thought to be @xmath10 , while its mass ratio is in the range @xmath11 ( patterson 1979 ; chincarini & walker 1981 ; robinson , shafter & balachandran 1991 ; reinsch & beuermann 1994 ; welsh , horne & gomer 1995 ; casares et al . 1996 ; watson , dhillon & shahbaz 2006 ; this paper ) .",
    "the absorption lines from the secondary star are very strong .",
    "the light curve of ae  aqr exhibits large flares and coherent oscillations of about 16 and 33  s in the optical and x - ray ( patterson 1979 ) .",
    "it also exhibits radio and millimetre synchrotron emission ( e.g. bookbinder & lamb 1987 ; bastian , dulk & chanmugam  1988 ) , as well as tev @xmath12-rays ( bowden et al .",
    "1992 ; meintjes et al .",
    "the balmer emission lines vary both in strength and shape and they may not be good tracers of the orbital motion of the white dwarf .",
    "this has led to the proposal of the magnetic propeller model ( wynn , king & horne 1997 ) .",
    "the study of the physical conditions in the intermediate polar ae  aqr is important because the system shows some remarkable and unique features .",
    "understanding the behaviour of this binary may help us to understand , for example , the role that mass transfer has in this kind of binary ( watson et al .",
    "obtaining accurate masses in this system is also an important goal . because the secondary spectrum is clearly visible , it is possible to determine a reliable value for @xmath13 , as we do below . in ae",
    "aqr , an unstable accretion disc is present , which makes direct observations of the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the accretion disc difficult and , consequently , the direct determination of the real @xmath14 value is unreliable .",
    "one indirect method of determining @xmath14 is to use the orbital variations in the spin pulse of the rapidly rotating white dwarf ( robinson et al .",
    "1991 ) . however , given that the secondary star shows a clearly measurable rotational velocity , an alternative way of determining the mass ratio is by combining the @xmath13 value with the rotational velocity of the late - type star ( horne , wade & szkody 1986 ) .",
    "it is then possible to deduce the value of @xmath14 , and use it , along with our measured value of @xmath13 and our estimate of the inclination , to calculate the individual stellar masses ( cf .",

    "we can observe in the table a certain trend with time .",
    "since the first observations by joy ( 1954 ) , there is a slight tendency towards larger radial velocity semi - amplitudes for the secondary star , a stronger tendency for lower values for the primary star , and hence a steady decrease in mass ratio .",
    "the secondary radii and calculated filling factors depend strongly on the mass of the primary and on the mass ratio , and therefore there is also a decrease in the main - sequence radius and an increase in the filling factor .",
    "these tendencies can not be attributed to real changes with time , but rather to a refinement in the measured parameters as a result of better observing techniques and the use of instruments with higher spectral resolutions .",
    "the latest results , by watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and this paper , differ mainly because of the adoption of different values for the semi - amplitude of the primary star .",
    "these estimates are derived from two new techniques : the entropy landscape and the rotational velocity of the secondary respectively .",
    "although entropy maps do in principle give the most `` accurate '' values of orbital parameters , their errors are very difficult to assess properly , because enormously time - consuming monte - carlo calculations would be needed ( watson et al .",
    "2006 ; see , however , watson et al .",
    "2007 for a way of estimating the error ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our result for @xmath21 depends on an educated guess as to which is the rotational velocity that gives the least - deformed secondary , among the values of this complex and variable parameter as a function of orbital phase . however , our result is in good agreement with the results by eracleous et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , based on the independent @xmath22 estimate .",
    "we have obtained also a very large filling factor , greater than previously estimated .",
    "such an increase in the radius of the secondary star could be explained through x - ray heating mechanisms discussed by hameury et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , while evolved main sequence star scenarios will also yield a significantly larger stellar radius ( kolb & baraffe 2000 ) ; in addition , any mass - transferring star is likely to be out of thermal equilibrium , increasing the radius as a result .    the paper by watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) only quotes explicitly the values for the masses and inclination that the authors deduce from their entropy landscape technique .",
    "this technique uses the currently most sophisticated procedure to allow for the variation in intensity over the surface of the secondary , and their results are probably the most reliable ones in table [ fundpar ] . to enable us to compare their results with our own , and with previously published results ,",
    "we have used their masses and inclination , together with equations ( 3 ) to ( 8) in the present paper , to compute the other entries in their row of table 9 ; these entries are in italics to emphasise that they have been derived by us and are not quoted in their paper ( the spectral type of k4 is assumed in their paper , so is not in italics ) .",
    "the most noticeable difference is that the @xmath14 value deduced from their paper is significantly larger than ours and than the @xmath14 deduced from spin pulse measurements ( eracleous et al .",
    "1994 ) .    as discussed in section 5 ,",
    "the observed radial velocity residuals seem to be explicable by a combination of irradiation effects on the hemisphere of the secondary facing the white dwarf and some form of enhanced absorption on the averted hemisphere .    a full discussion on whether the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary star in a cataclysmic variable increases with irradiation or back - illumination effects , or decreases with line quenching , has been made by several authors ( e.g. wade 1981 ; martin 1988 ; friend et al . 1990 ) .",
    "however , in the case of ae  aqr an estimation of this effect is not easy to obtain .",
    "we found that , from the published results shown in table  [ fundpar ] , only watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) make a correction , based on the entropy landscape technique .",
    "although they do not give an explicit value for the corrected @xmath13 , it is possible , as discussed above and shown in table  [ fundpar ] , to derive it from their given masses and inclination angle .",
    "since they quote an uncorrected @xmath23kms@xmath1 value , we estimate that their correction amounts to 0.8 kms@xmath1 only .",
    "we are unable to make a proper correction to our data , due to the complex behaviour of the velocity residuals shown in figure  [ fig2 ] and discussed in section [ rvsec ] .",
    "whether or not the underlying sinusoid in figure  [ fig1 ] may be a reasonable representation of the orbital motion or not , nevertheless , our uncorrected @xmath13 result does not differ greatly from the corrected value by watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    ", we may safely assume that our @xmath14 result , based on the mass ratio deduced from the rotational velocities and the semi - amplitude of the secondary , will not be significantly affected .",
    "we can indeed use their `` corrected '' @xmath13 value in equation ( 4 ) and obtain essentially the same result for @xmath14 as we find from our uncorrected value of @xmath13 .",
    "irradiation effects near the inner lagrangian point were also found by watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and they could partially explain the complex temperature behaviour as a function of orbital phase . at phase 0.0 we would observe an unirradiated hemisphere of the secondary with a temperature equivalent to a k0 star .",
    "however , where irradiation effects are important , there may be a quenching effect on the fe  i absorption lines greater than on the cr  i lines , producing ( paradoxically ) an apparent decrease in temperature and moving the spectral type to later classes on the irradiated hemisphere .",
    "the source of the enhanced absorption is harder to understand . although watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found strong evidence for a spotted region at high latitude on the secondary , at a longitude that corresponds to its being on the meridian roughly at orbital phase 0.25 , there is no sign in their roche tomograms of any enhanced absorption on the averted hemisphere .",
    "the source of the enhanced absorption that seems to be required by the velocity residuals thus remains uncertain , but is probably not a starspot , at least in the sense used by watson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "can we relate the variations of @xmath24 with orbital phase , shown in figure [ fig4 ] , to the variations in the radial velocity , and gain any further information about the region of enhanced absorption ? certainly , the amplitude of the variations , especially around phase 0.25 , is larger than expected from straightforward models of the effect of varying projected radius . in other words , around orbital phases 0.25 and 0.75 the absorption lines appear to be broader than expected .",
    "irradiation can perhaps account for the _ asymmetry _ between these phases , for example if the leading hemisphere were hotter than the trailing one ( as found for several cvs by davey & smith 1992 ; see also smith 1995 ) then the absorption lines would be quenched preferentially on the leading hemisphere , near the l@xmath25 point , and the line would appear somewhat narrower ( smaller effective @xmath24 ) at phase 0.75 than on the trailing hemisphere at phase 0.25 .",
    "however , it is hard to see how irradiation could ever cause the absorption lines to appear broader than expected from a purely geometrical effect .",
    "the larger - than - expected amplitude of the curve in figure  [ fig4 ] seems to require some additional source of broadening , or some intensification of the line that has the same effect when it comes to measuring @xmath24 .",
    "a region of enhanced absorption on the averted hemisphere , centred some 180@xmath26 in longitude away from the l@xmath25 point , might provide this , as well as accounting for the velocity residuals in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , this sheds no additional light on the source of the enhanced absorption .",
    "the other possible explanation for the large amplitude is that there is some additional physical mechanism operating that adds to the width of the line , such as turbulence , but it would need to be anisotropic , so that the broadening effect was enhanced at the quadratures ; there is no obvious reason why that should be so .    we conclude that our observations are consistent with , and indeed seem to require , a region of enhanced absorption on the averted hemisphere of the secondary star , but that they provide no convincing evidence for the source of that absorption .",
    "high - dispersion time - resolved spectroscopy of the cataclysmic variable ae  aqr was obtained during several observing runs over a ten - year period .",
    "the high spectral resolution coupled with the high signal - to - noise ratio obtained for the strong absorption lines allows us to find several fundamental parameters of the binary .",
    "the radial velocity analysis yields a semi - amplitude value of @xmath27kms@xmath1 for the secondary star and a systemic velocity of @xmath28kms@xmath1 .",
    "a new ephemeris was calculated by expanding the 39-y radial velocity database of welsh et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to 58y with new observations by reinsch & beuermann ( 1994 ) , casares et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and this paper .",
    "we have measured the absorption strengths and line ratio of fe  i@xmath29/cr  i@xmath30 and made a first order calibration with spectral type , using the spectral template stars .",
    "the line ratio varies as a function of orbital phase , equivalent to a variation from k0 to k4 with a mean value of k2 .",
    "the rotational velocity of the red star has been measured as a function of orbital period and shows ellipsoidal variations at twice the orbital frequency .",
    "using the models by casares et al .",
    "( 1996 ) we estimate an inclination angle close to @xmath31 .",
    "the rotational velocities are used to constrain the system mass ratio and yield a white dwarf semi - amplitude value of @xmath32kms@xmath1 consistent with the derived value from the spin - pulse results by eracleous et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . from these values",
    "we estimate the masses of the binary as @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ; and a separation of @xmath35 .",
    "an analysis using the @xmath36 diagram points towards a secondary star which is over - sized for its mass , with a radius greater than that of a normal main sequence star by a factor of almost two .",
    "finally , we discuss the measured temperature and spectral variations as a function of orbital phase and suggest that these may be the result of changes in the observed line ratios due to the presence of regions of enhanced irradiation , near the inner lagrangian point but perhaps preferentially on the leading hemisphere of the secondary , and of enhanced absorption on the averted hemisphere . the asymmetry in the variation of the rotational velocity with orbital phase",
    "may also be related to the presence of these regions .",
    "we currently have no physical model for the region of enhanced absorption , but it needs to produce absorption lines that are abnormally deep or broad , or both .",
    "we are grateful for the use of the facilities at the anglo - australian telescope on siding spring mountain , operated by the anglo - australian observatory , and at the 2.1-m telescope at san pedro mrtir , operated by the mexican observatorio astronmico nacional .",
    "we acknowledge the use of software developed by the uk starlink project and by the noao .",
    "we thank the referee for very careful and detailed comments that have led to significant improvements in the paper .",
