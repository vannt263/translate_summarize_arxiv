    "as is well known in general relativity , the energy conditions are often required in the proofs of various important theorems about black holes , such as no hair theorem or laws of black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the energy conditions are systematically obtained when one refers to the raychaudhuri equation , in which the interesting property of gravity is presented by the positivity condition @xmath2 , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are ricci tensor and any null vector , respectively . in einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) this geometrical condition is equal to a matter condition , called null energy condition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the stress energy tensor .",
    "especially , under the weak energy condition ( wec ) , the local energy density is positive and also implies that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a general timelike vector .",
    "for instance , in a perfect fluid case it is necessary to have @xmath9 we have @xmath10 and @xmath11 . as a result of continuity ,",
    "the wec in fact shows the null energy condition ( nec ) , @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "+ the energy conditions have been widely studied in in the context of modified gravity , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 gravity @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the study of modified theories of gravity is clear and strong .",
    "as we know , einstein s theory of general relativity can not explain the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe , unless an unknown dark energy element is introduced in the field equations @xcite .",
    "in the context of gr , the attempts to explain the observed speed - up of the universe , have introduced some modifications of einstein - hilbert action by adopting a general function of the scalar curvature in the gravitational lagrangian density as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this procedure consists of the analysis of strong gravitational fields near the curvature singularities and considering the consistent candidates of a fundamental theory of quantum gravity .",
    "according to string / m - theory predictions , scalar field couplings with the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath16 play an important role in the appearance of non - singular early time cosmologies .",
    "these impetuses have been studied to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "recently , a new generalized modified gauss - bonnet gravity , whose action contains a general function of @xmath17 and @xmath16 as @xmath0 , has attracted considerable attention @xcite . besides its stability , this attention is due to its ability to describe the present acceleration of the universe as well as the phantom divide line crossing and transition from acceleration to deceleration phases .",
    "two specific models of @xmath0 gravity were constructed to account for the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite , and the respective constraints of the parameters of the models were also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "so , in order to proceed along with the interests of these models , in the present work we shall consider two forms of @xmath0 introduced in @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors have studied the stability of de sitter and power - law solutions in @xmath0 gravity and have shown that gravitational action plays a very important role in the stability of the solutions both of which depending on the form of the @xmath0 theory and the parameters of the model . in this context , we further consider the constraints imposed by the energy conditions and verify whether the parameter range of the proposed models considered in @xcite are consistent with the energy conditions .",
    "more specifically , we define generalized energy conditions for @xmath0 modified theories of gravity , and consider their realization for flat friedmann cosmological models . in particular , we analyze whether the weak energy condition is satisfied by particular choices of @xmath0 which were advocated in refs . @xcite . + in section [ ref : ii ] , we introduce the gravitational field equations for the @xmath0 gravity . in section [ ref : iii ] , we obtain the inequalities corresponding to the energy conditions . in section [ ref :",
    "iv ] , we consider two specific forms of @xmath0 , and analyze the constraints resulting from the energy conditions .",
    "the paper ends with a brief conclusions in section [ ref : conclusion ] .",
    "we use the units @xmath18 .",
    "let us start by writing the most general action for modified gauss - bonnet gravity @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the matter action , and @xmath0 is a function of the ricci scalar and gauss - bonnet invariant defined by @xmath21 variation of the action ( [ mdgbaction ] ) with respect to the metric provides the following gravitational field equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined by    @xmath24    note that @xmath25 @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the stress energy tensor describing the ordinary matter .",
    "now , we consider the flat frw metric @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scale factor . in the frw background with a perfect fluid equation of state for ordinary matter ,",
    "the field equations for @xmath0 gravity are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energy density and pressure of ordinary matter , respectively , and the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to the time coordinate , @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath34 and the gravitational field equations may be rewritten in the following form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the effective energy density and pressure , respectively , defined by    @xmath38\\ , , \\label{eq : rho - eff-1 } \\\\",
    "p_{\\mathrm{eff } } { & \\hspace{-0.2em}=\\hspace{-0.2em } & } { 1\\over f_r}\\left[p^{(m)}+{1\\over \\kappa}\\left(2h\\dot{f_r}+\\ddot{f}_{r}+8h^3\\dot{f_g}+8h\\dot{h}\\dot{f_g}+4h^{2}\\ddot{f}_{g}-\\frac{1}{2}(rf_r+gf_g - f)\\right)\\right ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : p - eff-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    combining the above equations , we obtain the following useful relationship @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which will be used throughout the paper .",
    "in general , the energy conditions emanate when one studies the raychaudhuri equation given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the expansion , shear and rotation , respectively , associated with the congruences defined by the null vector field @xmath44 .    from raychaudhury equation",
    "it is seen that for spatial shear tensor with @xmath45 , and for any hypersurface orthogonal congruences , which imposes @xmath46 , the condition for attractive gravity , namely @xmath47 reduces to @xmath48 . in general relativity , using the einstein field equations one can rewrite the above condition in terms of the stress - energy tensor given by @xmath49 .",
    "however , in any other theory of gravity such as @xmath0 , one should know how to replace @xmath3 in terms of @xmath6 , using the corresponding field equations .",
    "equation ( [ eom ] ) may be written in the following effective form @xmath50 where the effective energy momentum tensor is given by    @xmath51    the positivity condition @xmath2 , through the modified gravitational field equation ( [ field : eq2 ] ) , supplies the following form for the null energy condition @xmath52 moreover , it is plausible to impose the condition @xmath53 for ordinary matter , because it implies that the energy density of ordinary matter is positive in all local frames of references .    to deduce the energy conditions in the context of @xmath0 modified gravity , we use the modified ( effective ) gravitational field equations and obtain the energy conditions as follows @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 here we have advocated the symbols nec , wec , sec and dec for the null , weak , strong and dominant energy conditions , respectively .    to continue , in analogy with the standard mechanics we introduce velocity , acceleration , jerk and snap in the cosmological context .",
    "thus , in addition to the hubble parameter @xmath58 , the deceleration , jerk , and snap parameters are defined by @xmath59 respectively ; in terms of which , we may consider the following definitions @xmath60 respectively . by using ( [ hh])-([hhh ] )",
    "one may rewrite equations ( [ eq : rho - eff-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p - eff-1 ] ) in the explicit forms , as follows    @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath62\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the matter energy density and pressure , respectively . to derive the above equations we have replaced for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in equation ( [ eq : rho - eff-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p - eff-1 ] ) , for example as @xmath69",
    "in this section , we consider the viable @xmath0 modified theories of gravity which were used in @xcite to study the stability of cosmological solutions . stability of power - law solutions for @xmath0 models were given by expressions ( [ uno ] ) and ( [ terzo ] ) , bellow .",
    "in the cases where no fluids are considered ( vacuum ) it is seen that stability of the cosmological solutions can be achieved by appropriate choices of the parameters space @xcite . however , in this section we consider the constraints imposed by the energy conditions and verify the consistency between the parameters ranges of the models considered in @xcite and the energy conditions in @xmath0 flat friedman cosmological models obtained here as ( [ 26])-([29 ] ) .    in this regard ,",
    "we consider two classes of viable @xmath0 given by @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are constants and @xmath82 are assumed to be positive .",
    "the ricci scalar and gauss - bonnet invariant , defined in equations ( [ eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : g ] ) in terms of the hubble and deceleration parameters , can also be expressed as @xmath83 @xmath84 respectively .    since the inequalities ( [ 26])-([29 ] ) imposed by the energy conditions in @xmath0 gravity are so lengthly , for simplicity we only consider the wec in the following analysis",
    "moreover , we take the following observed values for the deceleration , jerk and snap parameters @xcite : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .      to impose energy conditions on @xmath89 gravity , for simplicity",
    "we consider the vacuum , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "hence , the wec constraints for the vacuum , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are given respectively by    @xmath93 \\mu \\geq 0 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath94 \\mu \\geq 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .",
    "the left and right plots correspond respectively to @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the positivity requirement of the weak energy condition is satisfied in the plots for the parameter range considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   .",
    "the left and right plots correspond respectively to @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the positivity requirement of the weak energy condition is satisfied in the plots for the parameter range considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]        the exact analytical expressions for the parameter ranges of the constants @xmath80 and @xmath81 can not be explicitly obtained because the constraints provided by the inequalities ( [ nec1a])-([nec1b ] ) are so complex , so we consider specific values for some of the parameters . in @xcite",
    "the authors have shown that the vacuum solutions are stable for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . to verify this result from the energy condition s point of view , we plot the wec as a function of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as is depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : wec1a ] .",
    "it is seen that in the left ( right ) figure , the weak energy condition @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is satisfied for the parameter ranges @xmath97 and @xmath98 , in the specific form of @xmath99 gravity by equation ( [ uno ] ) .    in order to compare with the particular case @xmath12 , we put @xmath100 in equation ( [ uno ] ) .",
    "we find that equation ( [ uno ] ) can be reduced to @xmath101 , which is a class of @xmath12-gravity .",
    "the energy conditions of such theories have been studied in @xcite .",
    "therefore , considering @xmath100 in the current model the wec constraints , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are given respectively by @xmath102\\geq 0\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath103\\geq 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for more understanding the above relations , we have plotted them in terms of @xmath80 . obviously fig .",
    "2 shows that the wec is valuable for @xmath97 , and this is in agreement with result obtained in @xcite          in this case , as in the previous one , we consider the vacuum , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "this modified gravity model accounts for the stability of the cosmological solutions for late - time cosmic acceleration , and the stability of solutions depends on the values of the coupling constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath107 the perturbations grow exponentially , and the de sitter solution becomes unstable .",
    "for other values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 than mentioned above , the perturbations behave as damped oscillations decaying to zero , hence the solution becomes stable . to verify whether the parameter range of the stability of solutions are consistent with the energy conditions",
    ", we again consider the weak energy condition .",
    "+ for the form of @xmath108 considered by equation ( [ terzo ] ) , the wec constraints , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are given by    @xmath109\\geq 0 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath110\\geq 0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "it is seen that the weak energy condition dose not depend on @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , it turns out that wec do not interfere with the stability conditions . as in the previous example , considering the complex constraints provided by the inequalities ( [ nec2a])-([nec2b ] ) , finding exact analytical expressions for the parameter ranges of the constants @xmath79 and @xmath78 is not an easy task .",
    "hence , we consider specific values for the parameters to find wec condition as a function of the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is seen in the left ( right ) figure.3 that the weak energy condition @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is satisfied for the parameter ranges @xmath111 and @xmath112 , in the specific form of @xmath113 gravity by equation ( [ terzo ] ) .",
    "again , in order to compare with the particular case @xmath12 we put @xmath114 in equation ( [ terzo ] ) to obtain @xmath115 .",
    "the energy conditions of such theories have been studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , considering @xmath114 in our model , the wec constraints , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are given respectively by @xmath116\\geq 0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath117\\geq 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have plotted equations ( [ 274 ] ) and ( [ 2744 ] ) in terms of @xmath80 .",
    "4 shows that the wec is valuable for @xmath111 , and this is in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite        to complete our discussions , we have plotted sec and dec in the figs . 5 and 6 for two suggested @xmath0 models ( [ uno ] ) and ( [ terzo ] ) .",
    "from these figurers it can be seen that in both models sec holds but dec does not .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained previously in the study of energy conditions in @xmath12 gravity @xcite .",
    "note that for simplicity , we have examined the vacuum case @xmath118 .",
    "if we add regular matter to our models , the general results of the paper will not change , because with no loss of generality we may always add a positive energy density or pressure of matter satisfying the wec to the vacuum case such that @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the viability of another alternative gravitational theory , namely , @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we have considered two realistic models of @xmath0 , analyzed in the literature , accounting for the late - time cosmic acceleration and the stability of the cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the general inequalities by imposing the energy conditions . to be specific and for simplicity",
    ", we have focused on the weak energy condition and used the recent observational data of the hubble , deceleration , jerk and snap parameters .",
    "we have shown the consistency of the above - mentioned forms of @xmath0 with the weak energy condition .",
    "we have just examined the vacuum case for which @xmath118 .",
    "actually this is not a physically relevant case bearing in mind that the universe contains matter .",
    "this simplification , however , does not change the general results of the paper , if we add matter to our models .",
    "this is because we can add a positive energy density or pressure of regular matter satisfying the wec ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) to the vacuum case ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) such that @xmath119 , @xmath120 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
