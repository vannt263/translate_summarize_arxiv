    "in the off - shell @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production in order to take into account fwe in standard way we need to consider full cascade process with six - particle final state and intermediate - state unstable @xmath6 and @xmath23 bosons ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fac ] ) .",
    "there is another way to tackle the issue .",
    "the smup model @xcite provides the possibility to treat @xmath6 and @xmath23 bosons as final state particles and simultaneously to take into account their instability and obtain the finite - width effects correctly by smearing their mass shells @xcite . in this section",
    ", we give a short description of the principal elements of the smup model and its advantages compared to the standard treatment ( for more detail review of the smup model , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the up wave function in the framework of smup model is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the standard spectral component which defines a particle with a fixed mass squared @xmath26 in the stable ( fixed - mass ) particle approximation ( spa ) .",
    "the weight function @xmath27 is then accounts for the self - energy interactions of the up with vacuum fluctuations and decay products .",
    "this function includes all the information about up decay properties ( its instability ) and describes the smeared ( `` fuzzed '' ) mass - shell of the up .",
    "the `` fuzzing '' of the up mass shell is then caused , on the one hand , by quantum - mechanical instability according to the time - energy uncertainty relation and , on the other hand , by stochastic interactions of the up with the electro - weak vacuum fluctuations .",
    "then , the ( anti)commutative relations for the up field operators have an additional @xmath28-function in the `` smeared '' up mass @xcite @xmath29_{\\pm }   = \\delta(\\mu-\\mu ' ) \\delta({\\bar k}-{\\bar q})\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta},\\ ] ] here , subscripts `` @xmath30 '' correspond to the fermion and boson fields . the presence of @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ comm ] ) means that the acts of creation and annihilation of the unstable particles with different @xmath32 do not interfere .",
    "so the quantity @xmath32 has the status of the physically distinguishable value of the up mass squared @xmath33 .    in the model under consideration , the transition amplitude of the up decay @xmath34 directly follows from eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ comm ] ) , and can be written as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the corresponding amplitude in the spa , which is calculated in the standard way to a given order of the perturbation theory . from eq .",
    "( [ amod ] ) it follows that the differential ( in up mass squared @xmath32 ) probability of the transition is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is probability density of mass parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this function is induced by multiple up interactions with collective ( in our case , ew ) vacuum fluctuations of self - energy type and with decay products ( vertex - type corrections ) . in general , it is of non - perturbative nature and can be modeled in various ways . in this work ,",
    "we use the lorentz distribution function @xcite @xmath40 ^ 2+[\\mathrm{im}\\,\\pi(\\mu)]^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the conventional vacuum polarisation function , @xmath42 with bare up mass @xmath43 .",
    "the distribution ( [ rho ] ) is of the breit - wigner type and accounts for the electro - weak quantum fluctuations of up mass shell analogous to ones leading to a dressing up of the full propagator of an off - shell particle in the conventional quantum field theory .",
    "it naturally appears in the effective theory of up as the most suitable one in the high - energy processes @xcite , and was tested before against lep ii data on off - shell @xmath4 and @xmath5 near - threshold production @xcite .    as a general feature",
    ", such a model allows to consider the up as the final state particles and their instability is then included by a convolution of decay widths or cross sections with up mass probability density @xmath44 in each up leg due to exact factorisation property which was proven previously in ref .  @xcite . as a consequence of up mass - smearing effect ,",
    "this factorisation drastically simplifies the calculations .",
    "now , we wish to apply the formalism of smup model for prediction of the finite - width effects in the triple off - shell ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) bosons production .",
    "the processes @xmath45 at the tree level ( leading order ) in spa are described by the set of diagrams represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo ] . here",
    ", @xmath0 production is described by nine diagrams with topologies @xmath46 , whereas @xmath1 production is given by sixteen diagrams @xmath47 .",
    "the first subset of diagrams @xmath48 has a resonant character at @xmath22 , and plays significant role in the higgs and fwe contributions .",
    "complete nlo corrections to on - shell bosons production are described by additional few thousands diagrams , which were calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "due to exact factorisation property , the smup model @xcite allows to represent the total cross - section of the inclusive process @xmath49 in the factorized triple - convolution form ( as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fac ] ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the born - level cross - section as a function of different bosons masses squared @xmath52 in the spa , @xmath44 is the probability distribution of the boson mass squared in @xmath53th leg given by eq .",
    "the born @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross - sections were calculated using feyncalc v6.1 @xcite as functions of smeared masses of @xmath6 and @xmath8 bosons @xmath54 , and then their convolutions with @xmath44 over variable @xmath54 are performed numerically . in order to treat the poles in the boson propagators , which arise in the higgs resonance region in the integration over the phase space of the boson pairs , we introduce the @xmath55-dependent decay width of higgs boson in the propagator @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is standard width of higgs at the pole @xmath58 @xcite and other two terms account for the boson - pair channels of the higgs decay .",
    "it should be noted here , that the exact higgs width as a function of the momentum transfer scale ( [ hwidth ] ) is very important since it determines to a large extent the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross sections in the resonance regions , giving rise to the possibility of probing higgs decay properties .",
    "if higgs boson is heavier than 160 gev and behaves as predicted by the standard model , it decays predominantly into gauge - boson pairs and subsequently into four light fermions . and triple boson production at ilc can be rather sensitive to extra ( anomalous ) contributions to the @xmath59 coupling from the new physics @xcite .",
    "the approach under discussion has a close analogy with the convolution method @xcite and the semi - analytical approximation @xcite .",
    "however , the status of these approaches are different @xcite . in the framework of the smup model ,",
    "the expression ( [ ccsec ] ) directly follows from the up smearing - mass conception , and the function @xmath44 describes the probability distribution in up mass squared @xcite .",
    "moreover , the definition of the unstable particle field function ( [ phi ] ) determines the strategy of taking into account the major part of the higher - order corrections in the near - threshold energy domain @xcite .",
    "in the framework of smup model , the fwe were previously studied in the boson - pair production @xmath60 at lep ii in refs .  @xcite . in the boson - pair production in vicinity of the threshold , the nlo ew corrections are dominated by factorizable corrections to ew couplings , propagator - type ( self - energy ) corrections and the soft / hard initial and final state radiation while boxes , pentagons , etc can become relevant only at energies far from the threshold ones @xcite .    as the next natural step , we apply the same strategy in analysis of the triple boson production . for this purpose , we perform the following consistency check  we compared our @xmath61 and @xmath1 production cross sections in the spa including only initial state radiation and nlo vertex corrections ( renormalisation of the boson couplings ) with full nlo results from refs .",
    "@xcite in the 50 gev range nearby to the threshold and got very close results within a percentage accuracy .",
    "this basically proves that non - factorisable , box and pentagon diagrams do not significantly contribute to the near - threshold production cross section , and can be omitted for our purposes .",
    "this is the only approximation we adopt in our calculations .",
    "then we recalculated the on - shell @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross - sections at fixed @xmath62 in spa taking into account higgs boson fwe .",
    "again , the results coincide with ones reported in ref .",
    "the contribution of higgs diagrams and gauge boson fwe into the total cross - section at @xmath62 turns out to be relatively small .",
    "it is therefore very instructive to look at these contributions for heavier higgs boson .",
    "the cross - section of the process @xmath63 as function of @xmath64 at fixed @xmath65 ( just above the latest tevatron exclusion limit @xcite ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : zww - e ] .",
    "the born cross sections in spa and with taking into account the @xmath2 fwe ( due to the instability of gauge bosons in the final state ) in the framework of smup model are represented by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the corresponding cross - section including the initial state radiation ( isr ) corrections is given by the dashed - dotted line .",
    "these corrections together with the up propagator - type corrections effectively taken into account by up mass - smearing effects in the framework of smup model are the main part of nlo corrections at considered energies @xcite mass scale , while contribution from the renormalisation group evolution is small at energies close to the threshold @xcite . ] .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : zww - e ] that the contribution of @xmath2 fwe is occurred to be quite large for relatively heavy higgs boson in the near - threshold region .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zww - mh ] , the born cross - section is shown as function of higgs mass @xmath66 at various fixed energies .",
    "solid lines represent the total cross - section while the dashed lines  the part given by higgs - less diagrams only .",
    "this figure illustrates rather strong dominance of the higgs contribution due to higgs resonance in the @xmath5 phase space .",
    "it is worth to note here that the gauge boson fwe and smearing - mass effects naturally decrease at larger energies , and get practically negligible at @xmath67 gev .",
    "analogously , the cross - section of the process @xmath61 as function of @xmath64 at fixed @xmath68 close to the @xmath69 threshold is given by fig .",
    "[ fig : zzz - e ] , with the same notations as before . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zzz - mh ] , the born cross - section is shown as function of higgs mass at different fixed energies .",
    "again , similarly to the @xmath1 case , the contributions of gauge bosons and higgs fwe is large in the near - threshold region close to the higgs resonance .    in conclusion , we would like to notice that using the argument that the mass - smearing conception realized in the smeared - mass unstable particles model is in the good agreement with the lep ii experimental data on the near - threshold boson - pair production , we applied the same ideas to off - shell @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production at linear collides .",
    "the approach under consideration significantly simplifies the calculations with respect to the traditional one due to the exact factorization property .",
    "explicit calculations of the triple - boson production cross sections demonstrate rather strong dependence of the gauge boson finite - width effects on the higgs boson mass . in the near - threshold energy domain",
    "such effects are large and comparable with the initial state radiation corrections when the higgs - resonant contribution is significant , and small when the higgs contribution is negligible .",
    "the higgs - resonant contribution into the total cross - section is strongly dominant and have well - defined signature at higgs masses above the higgs decay threshold @xmath70 for @xmath1 production and at @xmath71 for @xmath0 production .",
