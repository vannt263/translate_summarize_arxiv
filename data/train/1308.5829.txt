    "there has been considerable scientific interest in the possibility of the violation of lorentz symmetry , in the context of searches for a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "its phenomenological consequences have been studied extensively , in particular in the context of the standard - model extension ( sme)@xcite . extensive experimental efforts have been made to bound the coefficients in all sectors of the sme@xcite .",
    "missing in these efforts is the study of weak decay . until recently ,",
    "there were , to our knowledge , only two dedicated experiments that addressed rotational invariance violation in @xmath1 decay@xcite .",
    "this effort is now supplemented by an experiment at kvi@xcite .",
    "theoretically , the issue of calculating cross sections and decay rates is also far from settled , although some amount of work has already gone into this@xcite .",
    "we started a joint experimental and theoretical effort at kvi , addressing the issue of lorentz violation in nuclear @xmath1 decay .",
    "we incorporate lorentz violation in weak decay by modifying the gauge boson propagator to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the usual minkowski metric and @xmath6 a general complex ( possibly momentum - dependent ) tensor , that parametrizes the lorentz violation .",
    "what we miss in this way are mainly kinematic properties of the external particles ( see ref .   for more discussion ) .",
    "@xmath1-decay transitions are classified by the spin change from parent to daughter nucleus ( @xmath7 ) and the parities of the parent and daughter nuclei , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "one distinguishes different @xmath1-decay transitions also by their _ forbiddenness _ , or the degree of suppression of the quantum mechanical amplitude that describes the process .",
    "this suppression is determined by factors of three small quantities : @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are the ratio of the nuclear radius and the de broglie wavelength of the leptons , the velocity of the decaying nucleon in units of @xmath13 , and the fine - structure constant times the charge of the daughter nucleus , respectively .",
    "factors of @xmath10 come from the leptons carrying away orbital angular momentum ( corresponding to higher order terms in the multipole expansion of the lepton wavefunctions ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 originate from relativistic and coulomb effects , respectively .",
    "if we assume these three quantities to vanish , we limit ourselves to so - called _ allowed _ @xmath1-decay transitions . the leptons do not carry away orbital angular momentum in this case .",
    "consequently , the total angular momentum of the lepton pair can be either zero or one . in the lorentz - symmetric case",
    "this translates directly into the selection rules for allowed @xmath1 decay , which can have spin change zero or one while the relative parity must be @xmath14 . with lorentz violation",
    "this connection is not that direct anymore , as explained later .",
    "when allowing for factors of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the leptons can carry off orbital angular momentum and the total angular momentum of the lepton pair can be @xmath15 , which allows for a larger spin change in the transition , as well as the possibility of a relative parity of @xmath16 . for a complete classification of transitions and their forbiddenness in the lorentz - symmetric and lorentz - violating cases ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "using the propagator in eq .  , we have calculated the rate of general @xmath1-decay transitions . the expression for allowed @xmath1 decay can be found in ref .  , and",
    "the one for forbidden transitions can be found in ref .  .",
    "in refs .   and we found that there is a relative enhancement of lorentz - violating effects in transitions with @xmath17 by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "from the very schematic expression @xmath19 that shows the hadron and lepton current , connected by the @xmath0-boson propagator , we see that the effect of the tensor @xmath6 is to connect the singlet and triplet parts of the lepton and hadron current in an unconventional way . for example",
    "the spacetime part of @xmath6 connects the triplet of the hadron current to the singlet of the lepton current .",
    "this means that there can be a unit of spin change in the nucleus , while the lepton pair does not carry off the corresponding unit of angular momentum .",
    "this is the cause of the enhancement factor that occurs in some lorentz - violating terms of the amplitude of transitions with @xmath20 . for a more elaborate discussion of this effect , see refs .   and  .",
    "using our results for a general @xmath1-decay transition we calculated the lorentz - violating transition rate of a first forbidden transition with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , dependent on the emission direction of the outgoing @xmath1 particle .",
    "it is given by @xmath23\\bigg\\}\\ , \\label{decayrspch2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the @xmath1-particle momentum , the neutrino momentum and the nuclear radius respectively , @xmath27 , latin indices run over spatial components only , the subscripts @xmath28 denote real and imaginary parts respectively , and the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) decay .",
    "we see the relative enhancement factor @xmath31 of the lorentz - violating effects .    using the expression in eq .",
    "we reanalyzed results from an experiment published in 1976 and described in ref .  .",
    "the experiment was done using a 10 ci strontium-90 source , which decays to yttrium-90 and subsequently to zirconium-90 .",
    "the relevant decay is the one from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , which is a first - forbidden transition with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the experiment",
    "the source and the detector were mounted on a turntable , which rotated with a frequency of 0.75 hz",
    ". meanwhile the current of electrons that originated from the source was measured .",
    "using the data of 232 good 2-h runs , asymmetries were defined in terms of the emission direction of the electrons .",
    "these asymmetries were fitted to distributions in sidereal time , given by @xmath34 bounds of the order of @xmath3 were obtained on the constants @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . using eq .",
    "we calculated the theoretical prediction for the asymmetries defined in ref .   and extracted the expressions for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in terms of @xmath6 . in this way we were able to put the following bounds at a @xmath38 confidence level@xcite :    @xmath39^{1/2 } & < & 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ , \\\\",
