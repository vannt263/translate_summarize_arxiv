    "in this paper we consider the following inverse problem .",
    "assume that we have a known heat conductive body and know the initial temperature inside the body ( say constant ) .",
    "we are in the situation that we can not access the whole boundary , however , want to know the time evolution of the temperature at a given point inside the body ( possibly close to an inaccessible part of the boundary ) after the initial time .",
    "how can one know it from the temperature and heat flux on an accessible part of the boundary of the body for a finite observation time ?    this is a typical inverse and ill - posed problem and appears in many areas of engineering and medicine .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop an analytical approach to the problem .",
    "we consider the simplest , however , important case : the heat conductive body has a known isotropic and homogeneous heat conductivity ; there is no heat source or sink inside the body . in this case , using fourier s law , after a scaling , one may assume that the temperature at a given point and time inside the body satisfies the heat equation",
    ". then the problem is formulated as follows .",

    "these are considered as unknown input or output that one can not control . in this paper",
    "we give two solutions to the problem .",
    "the consequence of the results stated in sections 4 and 5 is the following .",
    "let @xmath180,\\,t[$ ] , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath230,\\,t[)\\setminus\\gamma$ ] are contained in the half space @xmath24 in @xmath25 with a @xmath26 and @xmath27 , then there is an explicit formula to calculate @xmath28 from the data .",
    "see figure 1.1 for the configuration of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the half space @xmath24 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    here we explain our approach together with the construction of the paper .",
    "first we observe that the complex exponential function @xmath31 , @xmath32 satisfies the backward heat equation @xmath33 in @xmath34 . choosing a suitable @xmath35 depending on a large parameter @xmath36 , direction @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see ( 4.6 ) ) , we see that the real part of the phase function @xmath39 has the form @xmath40 .",
    "this yields that if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 as @xmath43 ; if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 as @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath46 divides the whole space time into two parts whose common boundary is the hyper plane @xmath47 .",
    "second we choose @xmath48 with @xmath490,\\,t[$ ] and @xmath50 in such a way that for all @xmath51 smooth on @xmath52 and for constants @xmath53 and @xmath54 independent of @xmath51 @xmath55 the examples of the choice of @xmath56 are given in subsections in section 4 .",
    "third we construct a special solution of the backward heat equation with a special inhomogeneous term : @xmath57 the point of the property of @xmath58 is : the growth order of a suitable norm of @xmath59 as @xmath43 is at most _",
    "algebraic_. for the construction of @xmath58 we basically follow a fourier transform method for a reduced equation to ( 1.3 ) which has been used in @xcite since it is _ constructive_. it starts with introducing a special fundamental solution denote by @xmath60 for the reduced equation .",
    "this together with necessary estimates are described in section 3 .    finally , integrating the equation ( 1.1 ) multiplied by @xmath58 over @xmath80,\\,t[$ ] and applying an integration by parts formula described in section 2 , we know that the quantity @xmath61 which is coming from the inhomogeneous term in ( 1.3 ) multiplied by @xmath62 , is divided into two parts : the first part consists of the data on @xmath30 and @xmath63 ; the second unknown data on @xmath21 , @xmath230,\\,t[)\\setminus\\gamma$ ] and @xmath22 . however , from the property of @xmath58 mentioned above and the assumption on the configuration of @xmath64 , @xmath230,\\,t[)\\setminus\\gamma$ ] and @xmath22 relative to the hyper plane @xmath65 we know that the second part tends to @xmath66 as @xmath43 . combining this with ( 1.2 ) for @xmath67 on @xmath52 ,",
    "one gets a formula to calculate @xmath28 from the data on @xmath30 and @xmath63 only .",
    "see section 4 for the precise description of the formula .",
    "this approach can be considered as an application of the _ enclosure method _",
    "@xcite to the heat equation ( 1.1 ) .",
    "in the final section we give an integral representation formula of @xmath60 that is important for calculating @xmath58 .",
    "moreover as a byproduct we present a carleman type formula for the heat equation , which instead of @xmath58 , makes use of @xmath68 directly which is a special fundamental solution of the backward heat equation .",
    "this approach is classical and the formula can be considered as an extension to the heat equation of yarmukhamedov s formula @xcite which has been established for the laplace equation .",
    "there are extensive mathematical studies in the case when the one dimensional heat equation is appropriate .",
    "this case is also referred as the _ sideways heat equation_. carasso @xcite considered the heat equation in the half line @xmath690,\\,\\infty[\\times\\,]0,\\,\\infty[\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "he gave a tikhonov regularization procedure that yields an approximation to @xmath7 for @xmath72 at an arbitrary fixed @xmath73 from noisy @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "note that by solving an initial boundary value problem for the heat equation in @xmath76 , one gets the heat flux @xmath77 from @xmath78 and thus his problem is reduced to one - dimensional version of our problem .",
    "motivated by carasso s work levine @xcite considered a radially symmetric solution of the heat equation in higher dimensions and established a tikhonov regularization procedure .",
    "their methods are based on an explicit integral representation for the solution of the heat equation and not time local in the sense : to determine the value of the solution of the heat equation at a fixed point in the body one needs the data for all the time ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "in contrast to their methods our method does not make use of any representation of the solution of the heat equation and needs data only on an appropriate finite time interval depending on the location of the point and time where and when we want to know the value of the solution and covers fully multi dimensional cases",
    ". for possible applications and numerical studies of the sideways heat equation , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this section we describe what we mean by a solution of ( 1.1 ) together with an integration by parts formula .",
    "we follow the formulation of the direct problem described in @xcite .    given @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 we say that @xmath83 satisfy @xmath840,\\,t[,\\\\ \\\\ \\displaystyle \\nabla u\\cdot\\nu+\\rho u = h_0\\,\\,\\text{on}\\,\\partial\\omega\\times]0,\\,t [ \\end{array } \\tag { 2.1}\\ ] ] in the weak sense if the @xmath85 satisfies @xmath86 in the sense of distribution on @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .    note that by theorem 1 on p.473 in @xcite we see that every @xmath83 is almost everywhere equal to a continuous function of @xmath89 $ ] in @xmath90 .",
