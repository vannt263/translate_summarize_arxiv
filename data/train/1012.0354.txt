    "cold , dense quark matter is one of possible states of baryonic matter formed at very high densities . while there is little doubt that such quark matter can be formed in principle , the value of the critical density needed remains unknown .",
    "this is one of the reasons why it is not settled whether such form of matter can exist inside neutron stars . indeed , the interior region of neutron stars is the most likely place to find dense quark matter .",
    "the corresponding densities reach up to about 10 times the nuclear saturation density , while the temperatures remain moderately low , of the order of @xmath1 or less .",
    "a recent report on a precision measurement of the mass of the binary millisecond pulsar j1614 - 2230 @xcite seems to strongly constraint the possibility of stellar dense quark matter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is hard to rule out quark matter solely based on the measurement of such a global property of a star such as its mass .. more informative probes of the state of matter at the highest densities are likely to be based on stellar characteristics determined by the transport properties of matter , various emission rates , as well as certain thermodynamic properties , which are sensitive to the spectrum of quasiparticles at the fermi surface and which , therefore , can provide a deeper insight into the microscopic nature of dense matter .    in this paper",
    ", we study one of such transport characteristics of dense quark matter , the bulk viscosity . in general",
    ", viscosity is one of possible mechanisms responsible for damping of the so - called r - mode instabilities in compact stars @xcite .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves tends to drive a differential collective motion of the stellar fluid in the form of r - modes @xcite .",
    "such modes in turn increase the stellar quadrupole moment and feed back to result in even stronger gravitational emission .",
    "if not damped by dissipative processes , the resonant growth of the r - modes can eventually lead to a breakup of the star .    the bulk viscosity in the normal phase of three - flavor quark matter is usually dominated by nonleptonic weak processes @xcite , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - weak ] ( a ) and ( b ) . under certain conditions , semileptonic processes ,",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig - weak ] ( c)(f ) , can lead to an order of magnitude increase of the viscosity as a result of their subtle interplay with the nonleptonic processes @xcite .",
    "when the temperature is sufficiently low or when the magnitude of the density oscillation is sufficiently large , the rates of the weak processes may get substantial nonlinear dependence on the parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the chemical potential imbalances that measure the departure of quark matter from @xmath4 equilibrium . in the context of the nonleptonic processes in",
    "strange quark matter , such effects have already been studied @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we extend the analysis to include also the semileptonic processes with the nonlinear corrections in the rates .",
    "when the nonlinear regime is realized , it may be reasonable to expect additional complications in the dynamics responsible for the energy dissipation of the hydrodynamic flow . in this paper",
    "we address one of such complications that is associated with the anharmonicity of the density oscillations driven by the r - modes . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "previously this has not been addressed in the literature . in studies of the bulk viscosity of stellar matter",
    ", one commonly assumes that the oscillations are perfectly harmonic .",
    "of course , this is justified in the linear regime , when different harmonics do not interfere .    in general , large magnitude density oscillations",
    "can hardly remain perfectly harmonic because higher harmonics can be generated by the nonlinearity . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the nonlinear regime in compact stars may be responsible for several qualitatively new features in the dynamics , e.g. , coupling of eigenmodes , a non - sinusoidal shape of oscillations , various resonance phenomena , and the formation of shocks and turbulence . at the fundamental level ,",
    "the nonlinear effects are the consequence of the equation of state of matter and the einstein equations , e.g. , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "usually , they play a profound role when the interaction energy is comparable to the energies of modes . however , the nonlinearity is present in principle even at arbitrarily small amplitudes of oscillations .",
    "then , one of the natural questions about the nonlinear regime is : how does the associated non - sinusoidal shape of oscillations ( i.e. the anharmonicity due to mode coupling ) change the bulk viscosity ? it is the goal of this paper to make a first attempt in exploring this issue .",
    "our study will be limited to the case when the density fluctuations are much smaller than the equilibrium density , although they can be much larger than the temperature . in view of this limitation",
    ", we can not address many features of dynamics that may develop in the extreme nonlinear regime .",
    "also , instead of considering realistic nonlinear oscillations found in stellar simulations @xcite , we will simply model the shape of density oscillations by using classical solutions to an anharmonic oscillator problem .",
    "such a toy - model study will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the problem and will trigger further developments in the future .",

    "<S> the bulk viscosity of cold , dense three - flavor quark matter is studied as a function of temperature and the amplitude of density oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the study is also extended to the case of two different types of anharmonic oscillations of density . </S>",
    "<S> we point several qualitative effects due to the anharmonicity , although quantitatively they appear to be relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , in most regions of the parameter space , with the exception of the case of a very large amplitude of density oscillations ( i.e. @xmath0 and above ) , nonlinear effects and anharmonicity have a small effect on the interplay of the nonleptonic and semileptonic processes in the bulk viscosity . </S>"
