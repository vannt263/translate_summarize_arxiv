    "the atlas survey @xcite is carried out on the vlt survey telescope ( vst ) , a 2.61-m telescope situated at cerro paranal observatory @xcite .",
    "it uses the omegacam camera@xcite containing 32 4k@xmath142k ccds with a total of 268 megapixels .",
    "the field - of - view of the camera is @xmath15deg@xmath2 and the pixel size is 0.21arcsec .",
    "the aim of the survey is to produce a @xmath0 catalogue to the equivalent depth of sdss but in the southern hemisphere , with a target area of @xmath1deg@xmath2 .",
    "although the survey was only specified to have seeing in the range @xmath16 fwhm , with the better seeing going to the vst kids survey @xcite , atlas is proving to have better median seeing than expected , at the subarcsecond level .",
    "the survey is being made alongside its sister vista hemisphere survey ( vhs , @xcite ) which is supplying yjk .",
    "the survey depths are also well matched to the wise survey @xcite at the mid - ir l and m bands .",
    "the footprint of the survey is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : footprint ] where it is compared to the footprints of kids and vhs .",
    "the deeper vista viking nir survey @xcite has approximately the same footprint as kids .",
    "atlas has yearly data releases with dr1 occurring in april 2013 and covering @xmath17deg@xmath2 of data taken before 30/9/12 and dr2 now imminent and covering @xmath18deg@xmath2 taken before 30/9/13 .",
    "the primary aims of the atlas survey are cosmological .",
    "the uv sensitivity of the survey gives it an advantage in terms of quasar surveys that in the southern hemisphere can be followed up using instruments like aat 2df or vista 4most .",
    "these surveys can then be used , for example , to look for any evidence of excess power in the quasar clustering data that might provide evidence for primordial non - gaussianity in the early universe .",
    "it may also be possible to search for bao at the 100mpc scale in the unexplored @xmath19 redshift range .",
    "these analyses can be done either by photo - z using selection codes like xdqso - z @xcite or by using spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we have already used aat 2df to make a redshift survey of @xmath20 quasars using uvx and nir selection and these are being used to study the luminosity and clustering correlation function of dusty and unobscured quasars ( chehade et al 2014 in prep . ) .",
    "this quasar redshift survey can also form the base for photo - z clustering analyses over the whole vst atlas area .",
    "such quasar surveys will also complement future programmes such as the x - ray agn surveys of e - rosita @xcite .",
    "another cosmological aim is to test for the isw effect by cross - correlating the 2-d positions of luminous red galaxies with microwave background temperature fluctuations e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is one of the few independent tests of the accelerating expansion of the universe and the southern hemisphere is the only place left to improve the statistical significance of this test .",
    "the galaxy and quasar surveys can also be combined to study the quasar lensing magnification bias at high redshift and the quasar galaxy clustering environment at low redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "atlas will also take advantage of its excellent seeing to allow many galaxy lensing shear projects . although not as deep as kids , atlas shares the same vst platform which means that the advantages of low optical distortion are shared by atlas for lensing projects .",
    "we shall also be looking at galaxy counts and how they vary over the sky at bright magnitudes .",
    "previous observations from 2mass have suggested that there exists a galaxy under - density in the southern hemisphere @xcite and we wish to test for the existence of this ` local hole ' at optical wavelengths .",
    "since vst atlas will also cover the great attractor region , this means that it can use the form of bright galaxy counts to search a large area in this direction for clusters and superclusters even behind shapley 8 .",
    "mapping the southern hemisphere using galaxy clusters is also another cosmological aim of vst atlas .",
    "the @xmath21 bands will be combined with vhs and wise nir bands to select galaxy clusters to @xmath22 .",
    "there are many other non - cosmological projects that can be done with atlas .",
    "the discovery of dwarf satellite galaxies and stellar streams in the southern hemisphere is one clear example @xcite and atlas is also being used to search for high redshift quasars via the lyman - break technique ( carnall et al , 2014a , in prep . )",
    "as can be seen from fig . [",
    "fig : footprint ] , the atlas south galactic cap area ( sgc ) area lies between 21h30 @xmath23ra @xmath24 04h00 and @xmath25 dec @xmath26 .",
    "the ngc area lies between 10h00@xmath27ra @xmath2315h30 and @xmath28 dec @xmath29 plus 10h00 @xmath24 ra @xmath24 15h00 and -30 @xmath23dec @xmath24 -20 .",
    "the total area of the survey is 4711 deg@xmath2 with 2087 deg@xmath2 in the ngc and 2624 deg@xmath2 in the sgc .",
    "the ngc area below dec@xmath24 - 20 is so far approved in @xmath30 and is the subject of a chilean eso proposal in @xmath31 .",
    "there is also an ongoing ` chilean @xmath6 extension project ' to double the exposure time in @xmath6 from 2 mins to 4 mins over the full atlas area ( pi l. infante ) .",
    "status maps of the atlas survey can be found at http://astro.dur.ac.uk / cosmology / vstatlas/.      omegacam camera pixels are @xmath32arcsec@xmath2 in size so approximately half the dimensions of @xmath33arcsec@xmath2 sdss pixels .",
    "the @xmath0 band transmissions are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : filters ] where they are compared to those for sdss .",
    "they are seen to be similar in all bands except for @xmath10 where atlas has an @xmath34 higher throughput .",
    "the atlas exposure times have been conservatively increased over the typical sdss 54s exposure to maintain the s / n achieved by sdss taking into account increased read - out noise and , potentially , sky brightness , particularly in @xmath4 and @xmath10 ( see table [ tb : exp_time ] ) .",
    "the omegacam read - out noise is typically 5 - 6 electrons per pixel and the gain is @xmath35 with 10% chip - to - chip rms .",
    "double exposures are taken , dithered by @xmath36 in declination and @xmath37 in ra , to cover the main inter - chip gaps ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 in declination and @xmath40 in ra ) and to allow cosmic rays to be rejected .",
    "the 2-pointing dither and @xmath41 tile overlaps leaves 28 ( @xmath42 ) and 14 ( @xmath43 ) small holes ( see green areas in fig . [",
    "fig : conf ] ) amounting to @xmath44% of the total area .",
    "each omegacam field is @xmath45deg@xmath2 and each tile has a @xmath46 centre - to - centre spacing , giving a @xmath47 overlap between tiles in both the ra and dec directions .    for each vst atlas tile ,",
    "2 dithered exposures in each of the @xmath31 bands were observed in dark time and 2 dithered exposures in each of the @xmath30 bands in grey / bright time .",
    "for all except the first 2 months of the survey , the observations were done in concatenations of 17 fields which approximately filled a 1hr eso observing block ( ob ) in @xmath6 ( including overheads ) and slightly less in the other bands .",
    "the seeing is specified to be @xmath48 fwhm .",
    ".atlas basic characteristics . atlas median seeing for eso a , b classified tiles .",
    "sdss median seeing is taken from @xcite .",
    "mag lim ( atlas ) corresponds to the median @xmath49 magnitude detection limit for stars as measured in a @xmath50 radius aperture .",
    "mag lim ( gal ) corresponds to atlas 5@xmath8 limit now calculated in apertures of the sdss seeing radius at airmass 1.0 .",
    "sdss mag lim corresponds to @xmath49 sdss point source detection limits based on the above fluxes and calculated in a radius of the above median sdss seeing at airmass 1.0 .",
    "sky brightness is measured in mag / arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "sdss dr1 sky brightness is median of 77068 frames from http://www.sdss2.org/dr7/products/general/seeing.html .",
    "fluxes are given at @xmath51 for atlas and sdss normalised to airmass 1.3 .",
    "sdss fluxes come from @xcite eqn .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     so in fig .",
    "[ fig : s82_atlas ] we now show in the top panel the comparison between s82 model magnitudes and atlas aperture 3 magnitudes for point sources .",
    "again the relation is linear with a low dispersion of @xmath52mag at the @xmath49 whdf atlas limit of @xmath53 from table [ tb : atlas_whdf ] .",
    "indeed , atlas aperture magnitudes in all bands show good agreement with the s82 magnitudes to their respective 5@xmath8 limits from table [ tb : atlas_whdf ] , confirming that the accuracy of these limits for point sources ( see http://astro.dur.ac.uk/cosmology/vstatlas/tests ) .",
    "the middle and bottom panels show the comparison between s82 model magnitudes and atlas petrosian / kron magnitudes now for sdss galaxies .",
    "both petrosian and kron magnitudes are reasonably linear but petrosian appears to have a higher dispersion at @xmath54 of @xmath55mag as opposed to @xmath52mag for kron . on this basis",
    "the preferred atlas magnitude for galaxy photometry again appears to be kron magnitudes .",
    "we now move away from checks of the linearity of atlas photometry to address in more detail the question of the consistency of the atlas zeropoint calibration as discussed in section [ sect : calibn ] over wider areas of the survey .",
    "maps of eso atlas - apass residuals in a @xmath56 deg@xmath2 area centred on ra@xmath57h , dec@xmath58deg are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apass_area ] .",
    "the atlas data is calibrated from the eso standards as used for the dr1 data release .",
    "the offsets in @xmath6 are obtained by extrapolating to @xmath6 from apass @xmath59 and the @xmath10 offsets are from interpolating apass @xmath60 and @xmath4 measurements .",
    "offsets are seen that are clearly due to atlas / eso calibration issues ( generally in blocks of @xmath61deg , corresponding to a single concatenation of tiles ) .",
    "clearly some within field residuals are seen , particularly in @xmath4 ( and @xmath10 ) , that do not show any atlas characteristics and we believe that these may be due to problems in the apass @xmath4-band ( and its extrapolation to @xmath10 ) . the distribution of apass - atlas ( tile - by - tile ) residuals for @xmath0 over a larger area is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : apass_hist ] and the standard deviations are @xmath62 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath65 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath10 ) .      figs . [",
    "fig : sdss_area_u]-[fig : sdss_area_z ] show the residuals between the sdss data for stars in the ngc overlap area at 10h@xmath24ra@xmath2415h30 and @xmath67dec@xmath68deg assuming , in turn , the eso calibration and the apass nightly calibration for atlas .",
    "the sdss magnitude ranges used are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the standard sdss calibration was used here for simplicity , rather than the uber - calibration of @xcite . as with the apass comparison in section [ sect : apass_atlas ] , the eso calibration clearly shows @xmath74 offsets on the scale of single concatenations .",
    "these are effectively removed by using the apass nightly calibration .",
    "the eso calibration also has larger residuals with clear vst nightly correlations .",
    "some nights have no useable eso standards and on these a long term average default value is used , perhaps explaining some of the stripes .",
    "however , even the apass nightly calibration still has occasional issues with individual fields as can be seen in the @xmath10 band image .",
    "also , we already noted that the apass @xmath4 ( and @xmath10 ) band photometry still has some issue from the atlas - apass comparison above .",
    "the distributions of sdss - atlas residuals for individual stars in @xmath0 for eso and apass calibrations are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_apass_offsets ] .",
    "generally the apass nightly calibrated data gives the smallest residuals with sdss .",
    "the eso calibration and the apass individual fields calibration ( not shown ) appear to give larger residuals , in the latter case presumably due to statistical errors with the calibration based on fewer apass stars .",
    "the atlas apass nightly - sdss mag standard deviations , measured on a tile - by - tile basis to reduce the effect of individual star random errors , are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 mag in @xmath0 , in most bands a significant improvement over the eso atlas - sdss comparison ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath75 and @xmath82 in @xmath0 ) .",
    "these standard deviations were measured on the basis of 183 tiles in @xmath83 and 112 tiles in @xmath6 . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath10 band result is affected by the presence of a single tile whose tile average is 0.66mag offset from the mean .",
    "nevertheless in all bands the improvement gained from the apass nightly calibration is clear .",
    "ultimately , for the final release , we shall calibrate atlas globally by incorporating the information from the @xmath41 overlaps in the ra and dec directions on each field ( findlay et al .",
    "2014b in prep . )",
    "we now use the same ngc sdss dr9 overlap area to compare atlas star - galaxy separation with that of sdss .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgcomp ] . comparing top left and top right panels in the atlas aper3-petrosian :",
    "@xmath63 magnitude star - galaxy separation plane , we see that the atlas star - galaxy separation statistic has included some sdss stars just above the stellar loci shown in the lower panels .",
    "these misclassified atlas stars have come from areas frequently coinciding with interchip gaps as can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : misclass_g ] .",
    "the problem arises when the image quality varies slightly between the 2 sub - exposures and so the stellar locus is offset in the interchip areas when there is only one sub - exposure contributing to the image . depending on the direction of the shift , this can result in stars being classified as galaxies .",
    "this problem will clearly be present in the atlas dr1 data .",
    "however , it is easy to fix this problem by plotting @xmath84 vst ( aper@xmath85-petrosian ) versus vst petrosian for atlas classified galaxies and then remove the misclassified stars by a magnitude independent cut .",
    "this has the effect of cleaning up the mis - classified stars as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : misclass_g ] .",
    "adopting the corrected star - galaxy classifier , we next calculate the galaxy ( and star ) counts from 250deg@xmath2 in the @xmath86 deg range in the sgc which includes the sgp .",
    "previously 2mass counts have suggested evidence for a local underdensity in the sgp region .",
    "here we simply focus on the counts to use their turnover to indicate the rough completeness limits of the survey . in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] we compare these to a variety of previous galaxy counts compiled by @xcite .",
    "2mass counts suggest evidence for a local underdensity in the sgp region @xcite but a fuller investigation of this issue using atlas data in a bigger area will be presented by mackenzie et al ( 2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "we see that the galaxy counts agree very well in most bands with other authors until the counts turn over due to incompleteness at faint magnitudes .",
    "this happens at ab mags @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these are in reasonable agreement with the mag lim ( gal ) 5@xmath8 limits for atlas given in table [ tb : exp_time ] .",
    "star counts turn over at about the same limits but this is more dictated by the star - galaxy separation algorithm and is less related to more fundamental signal - to - noise considerations .",
    "the eso science archive provides a repository for data products released by the eso public survey teams .",
    "images and catalogues from atlas data release 1 can be retrieved from http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form?phase3_collection=atlas&r elease_tag=1[http://archive.eso.org / wdb / wdb / adp / phase3_main / form?phase3_collection = atlas&r elease_tag=1 ] .",
    "atlas data are also available through the omegacam science archive ( osa , http://osa.roe.ac.uk ) , curated by the wide - field astronomy unit ( wfau ) at the university of edinburgh . similar in design to the science archives developed by wfau for sky survey data from ukirt / wfcam @xcite and vista @xcite , the osa provides a range of access methods to both image and catalogue data products .",
    "it stores atlas catalogue data and image metadata in a relational database management system , which can be queried through the osa web interface or using the virtual observatory ( vo ) table access protocol @xcite .",
    "query results can be viewed within the osa web interface or sent directly from it to vo - compliant desktop tools like aladin @xcite and topcat @xcite , using the simple application message protocol @xcite standard .",
    "the osa also integrates atlas catalogue data with a number of sky survey datasets , including sdss , 2mass , vhs and wise , and provides the atlas consortium with access to proprietary data , as well as supporting use of atlas public data releases by the wider astronomical community .",
    "we have described the basic characteristics of vst atlas . we find it meets its basic specification of comprising a ` southern sloan ' .",
    "this applies both to the median @xmath49 magnitude limits for point sources which are at least as deep as sdss and to the median sky brightnesses which are comparable to sdss . but in terms of its spatial resolution , the atlas survey presents essentially sub - arcsecond @xmath92 median seeing compared to the @xmath7 median imaging of sdss .",
    "we have derived the colour equations relating atlas stellar photometry to sdss photometry .",
    "we find there are small but non - negligible colour terms , particularly in @xmath93 .",
    "we have demonstrated the linearity of the atlas photometry by comparison in the 120deg@xmath2 ngc overlap area with sdss .",
    "we recommend that @xmath50 radius ( aperture 3 ) apertures are used for stellar photometry",
    ". for galaxies , atlas kron magnitudes seem to give the most linear relations with sdss model magnitudes .",
    "the same conclusions are found by comparing atlas and stripe 82 photometry in the whdf field .",
    "here we found that the rms dispersions reached @xmath94 mag for stars at @xmath95 and @xmath52mag for kron galaxy magnitudes at @xmath96mag    the current zeropoints assumed for @xmath0 come from apass stellar photometry applied nightly and appear good to @xmath97mag by comparison with sdss data in overlap areas .",
    "we have investigated how area dependent these zeropoints are in the sdss overlap area and find there are still small areas with residual errors . in the final global calibration we shall use the @xmath41 overlaps between tiles to reduce these errors .",
    "we have tested the atlas star - galaxy separation by comparison with sdss in the overlap areas and we found that 10% galaxies were misclassified as stars .",
    "we also found that 15% stars were misclassified as galaxies and that this higher rate was due to problems occurring in interchip gaps where only one sub - exposure was available .",
    "however , the problem is easily cured by using a more conservative star - galaxy separation line particularly at bright magnitudes .",
    "finally we also presented galaxy and star number counts in a 250deg@xmath2 area at the sgp and found where they turned over to define effective completeness limits .",
    "the galaxy counts turn over about at about our quoted 5@xmath8 mag limits for galaxies .",
    "star counts turn over at about the same limits but this is mainly dictated by the star - galaxy separation algorithm .",
    "we conclude that the vst atlas is ready for scientific analysis .",
    "currently the survey is 75% complete and it should be 100% complete by the end of 2015 .",
    "we are grateful to european southern observatory ( eso ) and their associated service time vlt survey telescope observers for carrying out the atlas observations .",
    "we are indebted to the cambridge astronomical surveys unit ( casu ) for reducing the atlas images and producing catalogues .",
