    "a topic of recent interest is magnetic reconnection between open and closed field lines at the interface between coronal holes and loops , dubbed `` interchange reconnection '' ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , ir hereafter ) .",
    "this mechanism can contribute mass , heat , and momentum to the solar wind , with numerous heliospheric implications @xcite .",
    "the solar wind may be classified as `` fast '' , when velocities @xmath2 exceed , say , @xmath3 , and `` slow '' , when @xmath4 .",
    "the steadier fast wind originates in polar coronal holes ( dark x - ray regions ) and similar open - field regions closer to the equator , propagating radially into interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "the more spatially and temporally intermittent slow wind originates in and around the coronal streamer belt @xcite , where a significant population of closed - field structures is found .",
    "the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) is always embedded within slow wind , which surrounds it in a region spanning about @xmath5 in latitude near solar minimum conditions @xcite .",
    "fast and slow wind differ in their plasma composition .",
    "generally the fast wind composition is similar to that of the photosphere , while slow wind composition is similar to that of coronal loops , with comparable abundances ratios of low to high first ionization potential ( fip ) elements and ions with different charge states ( e.g. , o@xmath6/o@xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "ir allows field - line connectivity to change from closed to open , thus releasing coronal loops plasma into the heliosphere .",
    "this has been suggested as a primary mechanism for the formation of the slow wind @xcite .",
    "recent observations motivate to advance our understanding of the physical processes at the root of ir .",
    "outflows along open fanlike field lines , at the edges of active ( closed ) regions , have been observed by _ hinode",
    "_ euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) measurements @xcite . @xcite found that the composition of these outflows is that of coronal loops and established a link with slow wind detected in situ by the solar wind ion composition spectrometer on board the advanced composition explorer ( ace ) .",
    "outflows in the streamer belt region are observed by the lasco - c2 white light coronagraph @xcite and stereo imagers @xcite , suggesting that mixing and dynamics contribute to the average observed configuration .    in most prior work",
    ", ir has been thought to occur only in special topological locations , at the apex of streamers and pseudo - streamers corresponding to @xmath0 or @xmath1-points @xcite , where field lines of _ opposite polarity _ can reconnect in a neutral point with @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite proposed that convective field line shuffling can trigger ir around the cusp region , resulting in the outward propagation of density enhanced blobs .",
    "but the physical mechanism leading to and allowing ir remains undetermined .",
    "in fact , the small value of resistivity in the solar corona implies that magnetic field lines are frozen in the plasma except where very _ small scales _ are present , i.e. , strong currents with an apt local magnetic field topology for magnetic reconnection to occur .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite of parker model for coronal heating @xcite have shown that the continuous shuffling of magnetic field lines footpoints by photospheric convective motions induces a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulent cascade in the unipolar closed coronal field with _ no null points_. this cascade transfers energy from the large to the small scales , driving field - aligned current sheets that are continuously formed and dissipated , where the magnetic field component orthogonal to the strong axial field is sheared , i.e. , its field lines are locally oppositely directed , and can reconnect ( _ nanoflares _ ) .",
    "therefore the _ unipolar closed field lines _ of coronal loops _ continuously change connectivity _ due to this dynamical activity .",
    "furthermore , in view of ubiquitous presence of magnetic fluctuations in this scenario , at each instant of time the magnetic field lines admit a random character due to field line _ random - walk _",

    "magnetic connectivity is very complex and changing .    ]    here we suggest that similar dynamics take place everywhere at the boundary between open and closed regions where turbulent ir can occur stochastically ( figures  [ fig : fig1]-[fig : fig2 ] ) , naturally accounting for the observed flows along and around these boundaries , including those at adjacent active region edges observed by @xcite , that can not be explained by ir at the streamer apex .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the dynamics of ir at the interface between open and closed corona , with photospheric convective motions shuffling the magnetic field lines footpoints . for a simple first demonstration",

    "this opening and closing of field lines is caused by the highly dynamic current sheets and reconnection described above .",

    "field lines traced from the middle of the originally closed and open regions , i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , exhibit an isotropic distribution of footpoints of different extension because in the closed region magnetic fluctuations are stronger .",
    "no waves are injected from the region @xmath22 with @xmath10 , but magnetic field fluctuations `` leak '' from the closed region , where magnetic forces push the magnetic islands against each other and these forces are unbalanced by weaker fields in the open region , with the energy density reducing across the original boundary at @xmath14 .",
    "this drop in turbulence intensity along @xmath27 is the cause of anisotropy for the footpoints distributions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 that are narrower along @xmath27 .",
    "field lines traced from @xmath57 and @xmath54 , more distant from the initial open - closed boundary , never change connectivity from open to closed ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "but those traced from @xmath55 and @xmath56 do , and their p.d.f.s are shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "they have a probability of @xmath58 to change connectivity from their initial type at time @xmath15 . from the dynamical point of view",
    "the probability can be seen as the fraction of time the field line is closed or open .     for @xmath55 and @xmath59 , across the boundary between open and closed regions at @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ]    given the complex character of the magnetic field @xmath60 , which becomes broad band in space , while also evolving in time , it is natural to try to describe the spreading ( and changes of connectivity ) as a _ diffusive _ process .",
    "in fact there are two related diffusive processes at work .",
    "first , in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] we see that at a fixed instant of time , field lines wander randomly due to fluctuations .",
    "second , for the spreading found in the above numerical experiment shown in figures  [ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] , the time dependence of the turbulence contributes an additional randomizing effect .",
    "the diffusive nature of the field line spreading is verified by the computation ( not shown ) of the mean square displacement @xmath61 , which increases linearly with height in the manner of diffusion : @xmath62 we found this linear scaling for all values of @xmath49 , with diffusion coefficients , e.g. , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath53 , 1 , and @xmath54 respectively ( normalized to @xmath19 ) .",
    "this type of randomization of magnetic field lines is not often associated with coronal fields ( usually modeled as smooth and laminar ) , where field lines may be line - tied at both ends .",
    "this diffusive rearrangement of connectivity _ requires _ magnetic reconnection to occur .",
    "a quantitative theory for this space - time diffusion of field lines appears to be tractable but lengthy , and we will address it in a subsequent paper ( ruffolo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "two features of the diffusion theory are pertinent at present .",
    "first , the expected @xmath61 at height @xmath20 due to single time randomization  the flrw effect  and the expected additional mean square displacement at height @xmath20 due to the time dependent changing of field lines , are of the same order .",
    "second , there are two broad classes of flrw diffusion coefficients , say @xmath66 , the quasi - linear result @xcite , and @xmath67 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are suitable coherence scales in directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath70 , with @xmath71 in the closed region .",
    "note that the present case of reduced mhd requires the ordering @xmath72 , from which @xmath73 .",
    "consequently we anticipate that the observed diffusive spreading ( figures  [ fig : fig2]-[fig : fig4 ] ) is characterized by a diffusion coefficient on the order of the quasi - linear result .    also important",
    "is the evolving structure of the boundary between open and closed regions . at time @xmath15 the boundary is simply the plane @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , but at later times the magnetic surface has to be computed .    ]    in reduced mhd , with uniform axial field @xmath74 and transverse fluctuations @xmath60 , the magnetic surface coordinate @xmath75 obeys the magnetic differential equation @xmath76 where the right side involves only the components of @xmath77 transverse to @xmath70 , with initial condition @xmath78 .",
    "the numerical code employs a third order runge - kutta , quadratic interpolation , and adaptive step - size .    like a passive scalar , solutions to equation  ( [ eq : ms ] )",
    "can acquire a complex structure @xcite .",
    "the boundary magnetic surface @xmath79 separates the two topologically different regions , and in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] it is shown at time @xmath80 .",
    "its structure is fractal , appears like a pleated drape with many intricate folds , but for a continuous field @xmath60 it does not tear no matter how folded it is , although numerically a small diffusivity removes the smallest - scale folds and minor tearing occurs .",
    "the boundary magnetic surface evolves in time and on the average its map on the plane @xmath22 has an excursion in @xmath27 given by twice @xmath81 ( equation  ( [ eq : diff ] ) ) , where @xmath82 is the loop length .",
    "previous studies have shown that ir is required , e.g. , to explain the quasi - rigid rotation of coronal holes in presence of the underlying photospheric differential rotation @xcite , but this approach ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assumes a quasi - steady coronal response to photospheric evolution . in the prevailing view",
    "that coronal interchange occurs at the apex of streamers and pseudo - streamers in correspondence of @xmath0 or @xmath1-points @xcite , all previous simulations and modeling have used _ smooth large - scale fields _ that contain neutral points ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "@xcite anticipated that field line footpoints shuffling may promote ir at the boundary between open and closed regions .",
    "the present model provides a specific mechanism for this to occur , modeling ir as component reconnection that may occur all along the magnetic interface between coronal hole and loop threaded by a unipolar field that contain no true neutral points , and extends the range of occurrence of ir proposed by @xcite .",
    "these reconnection sites are well known in the context of nanoflare models , but their role in interchange has not been previously emphasized .",
    "here we simulate only a small volume of the open - closed region interface to employ a higher spatial resolution .",
    "this allows the development of mhd turbulence , with its associated _ magnetic fluctuations _ in the coronal field ( figures  [ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] ) , naturally induced by photospheric motions shuffling the field lines footpoints .",
    "turbulent ir renders the boundary between open and closed regions dynamic ( figures  [ fig : fig3]-[fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the boundary fluctuates continuously with an average displacement of the order of the super - granulation scale @xmath24 .",
    "ir can then inject loop plasma along the boundary and in the fanlike regions adjacent to closed regions , where slow streams with loop composition have been recently observed @xcite , providing an alternate mechanism to account for the plasma composition at the edges of active regions @xcite , and additional momentum , mass and energy for the streams originating from there @xcite .    in a realistic geometry",
    "the field lines originating from this small fanlike regions expand super - radially in the heliosphere and map in an extended region around the hcs .",
    "thus flows due to turbulent ir naturally diffuse away from the hcs , overcoming the restriction of the smooth field model proposed by @xcite that admit diffusion only for streams originating from narrow open flux channels connecting two coronal holes .    in summary ,",
    "when field lines footpoints are shuffled by photospheric motions , component magnetic reconnection is expected to occur in unipolar loop and open field regions and near the boundaries between them .",
    "this stochastic ir is likely to operate all along these boundaries and adjacent regions , where closed and open field lines can then _ continuously change connectivity_. on this basis we suggest that plasma and energy transport along these magnetic field lines may be an important factor in generating the slow wind , and in broadening the regions in which compositional and other properties are mixed in the solar wind .    in the future we plan to extend this work",
    "to more realistic reduced and full mhd models that include curvature and expansion effects and alternate boundary conditions , allowing us to determine the relative importance of apex neutral point ir and stochastic component ir .",
