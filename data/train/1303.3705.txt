    "early calculations carried out by mikkola & innanen ( 1992 ) showed that the existence of asteroids following co - orbital motion with venus in the form of tadpole or horseshoe orbits stable for a few myr was possible .",
    "numerical integrations of the orbits of near - earth objects ( neos ) revealed that some of them can eventually follow co - orbital motion with venus ; for example , ( 4660 ) nereus ( michel 1997 ) and ( 99907 ) 1989 va ( christou 2000 ) . in his study ,",
    "christou also predicted a quasi - steady - state flux of such objects moving in and out of the co - orbital regime .",
    "tabachnik & evans ( 2000 ) and brasser & lehto ( 2002 ) used simulations to show that venus trojans would be stable in low - inclination orbits .",
    "these theoretical findings soon gained observational support with the discovery and subsequent identification of two present - day co - orbital companions to venus : ( 322756 ) 2001 ck@xmath0 , a horseshoe - quasi - satellite orbiter ( brasser et al .",

    "both are relatively small and their respective absolute magnitudes , @xmath4 , are 18.9 and 20.3 . the existence of a transient population of neos trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with venus has been explained by morais & morbidelli ( 2006 ) within the steady - state scenario envisioned by bottke et al .",

    "taking into account the two objects already known , this translates into completeness for @xmath7 21 .",
    "if , as morais & morbidelli ( 2006 ) suggest in their work , current surveys have reached completeness at such small sizes , no objects in similar orbits and brighter than @xmath4 = 21 should be observed in the future . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the existence of present - day primordial venus co - orbitals is very unlikely due to the presence of multiple secular resonances ( scholl , marzari & tricarico 2005 ) .    in this paper",

    "an object is co - orbital to a planet if their orbital periods and therefore their semi - major axes are nearly equal . once an object is trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance and depending on its relative energy with respect to the host planet ( hnon 1969 ) , it can describe any of the three main orbit types : quasi - satellite , tadpole or horseshoe .",
    "the names refer to the actual shapes of the orbits when seen in a frame of reference rotating with the host planet .",
    "the key parameter to differentiate among these three main orbit types and additional compound states , as first described by namouni ( 1999 ) , is the libration of the difference between the mean longitudes of the object and its host planet or relative mean longitude , @xmath17 .",
    "the mean longitude of an object is given by @xmath18 = @xmath19 + @xmath20 + @xmath21 , where @xmath19 is the mean anomaly , @xmath20 is the longitude of ascending node and @xmath21 is the argument of perihelion . if the object follows a quasi - satellite orbit , @xmath17 oscillates around 0@xmath22 .",
    "when the object moves in a tadpole orbit , @xmath17 librates around 60@xmath22 ( l@xmath23 trojan ) or -60@xmath22 ( or 300@xmath22 , l@xmath5 trojan ) . for objects moving in eccentric and/or inclined orbits the location of the lagrangian points l@xmath23 and l@xmath5 changes ; for example , in an orbit as eccentric as that of 2012 xe@xmath3 , it is shifted in @xmath18 towards the l@xmath6 point by 30@xmath22 - 40@xmath22 ( namouni & murray 2000 ) .",
    "if the libration amplitude is larger than 180@xmath22 , encompassing l@xmath6 , l@xmath23 and l@xmath5 but not reaching the actual planet , it is said that the object follows a symmetric horseshoe orbit .",

    "when the relative mean longitude oscillates freely , we say that the object is no longer in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with the planet , i.e. it becomes a passing object .    in order to confirm the co - orbital nature of 2012 xe@xmath3 with venus , we have performed @xmath10-body calculations using the hermite integrator ( makino 1991 ; aarseth 2003 ) in both directions of time for 10 kyr .",

    "the object is a venus co - orbital currently following a transitional trajectory between venus lagrangian points l@xmath5 and l@xmath6 .",
    "our calculations ( see figs [ lambda ] and [ all ] , left - hand panels ) show that 2012 xe@xmath3 has already remained in the 1:1 commensurability with venus for several thousand years . for most of that time ( 4000 yr ) , it has been following a tadpole orbit in the neighbourhood of venus l@xmath5 point .",
    "after a close encounter with the earth at 0.012 au 346 yr ago , it started moving away from the lagrangian point l@xmath5 to undergo a transition between its previous tadpole orbit and a horseshoe orbit .",
    "horseshoe orbits are generally less stable than tadpole orbits , and they are often considered as a transitional state before ejection from a 1:1 resonance ( see , e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) . however , for the particular case of earth s and venus horseshoe librators , long - lived configurations are possible ( uk , hamilton & holman 2012 ) .",
    "all the computed control orbits confirm that 2012 xe@xmath3 currently follows a rather irregular path of the horseshoe type , approaching the neighbourhood of l@xmath6 .",

    "its future orbital evolution depends strongly on the outcome of a very close encounter with the earth that will take place in the time frame 85 - 340 yr from now .",
    "nearly half of the control orbits evolve into passing orbits beyond that point , to never return to the venus co - orbital region .",
    "the rest remain in or near the co - orbital region for thousands of years , at least @xmath273000 yr . for those orbits ,",
    "a variety of dynamical behaviours are observed , including compound quasi - satellite - tadpole episodes and l@xmath5 tadpole orbits but also short circulation events . as for the past",
    ", nearly 70 per cent of the control orbits remained as an l@xmath5 trojan for about 3 - 5 kyr prior to the close encounter with the earth that sends the object in the neighbourhood of l@xmath6 .",
    "the remaining control orbits exhibit various horseshoe orbit types including not only symmetric but also asymmetric ones . beyond about 3000 yr into the past , the orbit is difficult to predict .",
    "nearly 10 per cent of the control orbits remain within the venus co - orbital region for the entire simulated time , 20 kyr , but alternating multiple dynamical states and circulation episodes .",
    "repetitive episodes as the ones described here , in which the relative mean longitude librates for several cycles and then circulates for a few more cycles before restarting libration once again , are characteristic of a type of dynamical behaviour known as resonance angle nodding , see ketchum , adams & bloch ( 2013 ) .",
    "these authors concluded that nodding often occurs when a small body is in an external ( near ) mean motion resonance with a larger planet .",
    "this type of complicated dynamics has been observed in other horseshoe librators . during the studied timespan ,",
    "2012 xe@xmath3 remains at a safe distance from venus ( see fig . [ distances ] ) , but close encounters are possible both at perihelion ( with mercury ) and at aphelion ( with the earth ) ; these encounters are critical in changing the dynamical status of the object as discussed in the following section .         from mercury ( top panel ) , venus ( middle panel ) , and the earth ( bottom panel ) .",

    "[ animation2 ] .",
    "there are many similarities but also obvious differences , mostly in terms of short - term stability .",
    "all of them move in rather eccentric orbits with moderate inclinations and all of them are mercury grazers , venus crossers and earth crossers",
    ". as the orbits of 322756 , 2002 ve@xmath1 and 2012 xe@xmath3 are very much alike , the overall details of the mechanism that controls their orbital behaviour must be similar too .",
    "when moving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance , transfers between quasi - satellite , horseshoe and tadpole orbits are the result of the libration of the nodes ( wiegert , innanen & mikkola 1998 ) .",
    "our analysis of the dynamics of 2002 ve@xmath1 in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2012 ) confirmed the result obtained by mikkola et al .",
    "( 2004 ) : during the quasi - satellite phase the distance to the descending node of the object remains remarkably close to the value of earth s aphelion and the distance to the ascending node is also relatively close to mercury s aphelion .",
    "here we have a similar situation . in the solar system and for an object following an inclined path , close encounters with major planets are only possible in the vicinity of the nodes .",
    "the distance between the sun and the nodes is given by @xmath28 , where the + sign is for the ascending node and the - sign is for the descending node .",
    "close encounters at the nodes control the dynamics of 2002 ve@xmath1 and fig .",
    "[ all ] , panels a , b and g , clearly reveals that it is also the case for 322756 and 2012 xe@xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the future evolution of the distances to the nodes of 2002 ve@xmath1 and 2012 xe@xmath3 is analogous .",
    "we can therefore conclude that 322756 , 2002 ve@xmath1 and the recently discovered 2012 xe@xmath3 are part of a dynamical group which is characterized by the libration of their nodes between the orbits of mercury and the earth . as a result , the gravitational perturbations from the earth and mercury are currently most effective in keeping these asteroids at a safe distance from venus . at present , 2012",
    "xe@xmath3 approaches the earth in the vicinity of its descending node in november - december every eighth year ; in a way , this contributes to stabilizing the orbit if the distance of the closest approach is larger than about 0.03 au .",
    "these three objects orbit the sun in a near 8:13 resonance with the earth but they also move in a near 9:23 resonance with mercury although this is less clear than the near resonance with the earth . the three objects exhibit resonant ( or near resonant ) behaviour with mercury , venus and the earth .",
    "however , 2012 xe@xmath3 follows the most eccentric orbit and has the smallest inclination , which translates into more frequent and closer encounters with the earth and explains why its orbit is the most unstable of the three .",
    "encounters with mercury as close as 0.0011 au and with venus ( only in the future ) at 0.002 au have also been observed in a few of the control orbits .",
    "close encounters with venus are only observed when the nodes are far from the perihelion / aphelion positions .",
    "our results for 322756 are fully compatible with those in brasser et al .",
    "( 2004 , fig .",
    "1 ) for the next 2000 yr but differences appear beyond that point .",
    "these arise from the fact that we are using the newest orbital elements , different physical models and the intrinsic chaos that drives the dynamical evolution of the object .",
    "morais & morbidelli ( 2006 ) studied the population of venus co - orbitals that are also neos and concluded that the average duration of a venus co - orbital episode is @xmath2732000 yr . our calculations indicate that 2012 xe@xmath3 current co - orbital episode is going to be significantly shorter but it is also true that its absolute magnitude is higher than the limiting value in their study and , therefore , their results may not apply in this case .",
    "they also estimated that the number of objects with absolute magnitude @xmath29 that become co - orbital with venus over a time interval @xmath30 is @xmath31 , where @xmath10 is given in table 1 of their 2006 paper and @xmath32 is the average duration of a venus co - orbital episode .",
    "the model in morais & morbidelli ( 2006 ) is based on a previous model by bottke et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) which only applies in the size range corresponding to @xmath33 .",
    "this limit ( about 400 m in diameter ) reflects the transition from tensile strength dominated bodies to rubble piles or gravity - dominated aggregates ( see , e.g. , love & ahrens 1996 ) .",
    "even with this limitation in mind , it could be useful to have some estimate of the expected number of smaller objects .",
    "if we assume a power law of the form @xmath34 and use the results obtained by morais & morbidelli ( 2006 ) to find the constant and the index @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of objects with absolute magnitude @xmath29 .",
    "this simple extrapolation ( plotted in fig .",
    "[ size ] ) predicts about 14 objects for @xmath38 , which translates into about 10 objects similar to 2012 xe@xmath3 waiting to be discovered .",
    "but if the average duration of co - orbital episodes is shorter for smaller , less massive objects as the case of 2012 xe@xmath3 appears to suggest , then the actual number of very small objects in co - orbital motion with venus over a given timespan could be much larger in relative terms than the equivalent figure for larger objects like 322756 or 2002 ve@xmath1 .",
    "it may be argued that because our present calculations neglect the effects of non - gravitational forces like the yarkovsky force , we can not discuss the possibility of size - dependent trends in our results but nominal orbits used to compute the initial conditions for our integrations are based on the real positions of the objects , affected or not by non - gravitational forces .",
    "therefore , the present orbital state of any observed object is always the result of all the ( real ) forces acting on the object .",
    "if the yarkovsky force has any effects on the orbital evolution of the objects discussed here , those effects are already present on the initial conditions of the simulations but they are gradually lost if the integrations do not account for the yarkovsky force , which is the case here . the time - scale in which such information is lost is likely longer than the characteristic e - folding time for these objects .    ) and the predictions from equation ( [ law ] ) . ]",
    "the co - orbital identified in this paper was initially selected because of its small relative semi - major axis that is nearly 0.0004 au .",

    ", wide - field neo surveys have found thousands of objects passing in the neighbourhood of the earth : could it be possible that some of these objects may have not been properly identified and they are , in fact , trapped ( even if temporarily ) in a 1:1 commensurability with venus ? in order to explore this possibility and try to uncover neglected venus co - orbitals , we have studied the evolution of all the known objects with relative semi - major axis ( to venus ) @xmath390.006 au . in this way , we have confirmed that no other known object ( as of 2013 march 7 ) is currently co - orbital to venus .",
    "however , we have found two additional objects , 2007 ag and 2002 lt@xmath40 , that may experience very brief co - orbital episodes ( duration @xmath3910@xmath41 yr ) in the timespan @xmath810@xmath42 yr . the asteroid 2007 ag has an absolute magnitude of 20.13 ( it is brighter than 2002 ve@xmath1 ) , a relative semi - major axis of 0.0030 au , an eccentricity of 0.37 and an inclination of 11@xmath4394 .",
    "its tadpole ( l@xmath5 ) and horseshoe episodes are few and brief ( @xmath39 900 yr ) ; its orbit is well known with a data - arc span of 1791 d. more interesting is the case of 2002 lt@xmath40 at @xmath4 = 21.85 with a relative semi - major axis of 0.0035 au , an eccentricity of 0.5 and an inclination of just 0@xmath4376 .",
    "it also experiences horseshoe behaviour with respect to venus in several occasions , the longest centred about 2000 yr into the future and lasting nearly 1000 yr . the orbit of this object is also very reliable with a data - arc span of 2934 d. like 2007 ag , 2002 lt@xmath40 is an aten and neo that is also included in the potentially hazardous asteroid ( pha ) list .",

    "our analysis of the orbit of 2012 xe@xmath3 reveals that this small neo is following a transitional , highly chaotic path .",
    "the object has been a co - orbital companion to venus for several thousand years and it may become a passing object within the next few hundred years .",
    "the future orbital evolution of this recently discovered minor body is not easily predictable beyond that time - scale .",
    "its orbit is the most chaotic among venus co - orbitals .",
    "the three known venus co - orbitals follow similar orbits with e - folding times of the order of 100 yr and exhibit resonant ( or near - resonant ) behaviour with mercury , venus and the earth .",
    "our calculations indicate that the thickness of venus co - orbital region is 0.004 au with 2007 ag , 2002 lt@xmath40 and 2003 ko@xmath44 signalling the edge of the region .",
    "extrapolation of the number distribution of venus co - orbitals as a function of the absolute magnitude suggests that dozens of objects similar to 2012 xe@xmath3 could be transient companions to venus but ground - based surveys may have substantial difficulties in finding them due to the nature of their orbits and intrinsic faintness .",
    "our calculations did not include the yarkovsky effect which may have a non - negligible role on the medium , long - term evolution of objects as small as 2012 xe@xmath3 .",
    "proper modeling of the yarkovsky force requires knowledge on the physical properties of the objects involved ( for example , rotation rate , albedo , bulk density , surface conductivity , emissivity ) which is not the case for 2012 xe@xmath3 .",
    "detailed observations during future encounters with the earth should be able to provide that information .",
    "the non - inclusion of this effect has no impact on the assessment of the current status of this object as a venus co - orbital .",
