    "in recent papers the general formalism to study polytropes for anisotropic matter has been presented , both in the newtonian @xcite and the general relativistic regimes @xcite . the motivations to undertake such a task were , on the one hand , the fact that the polytropic equations of state allow to deal with a variety of fundamental astrophysical problems ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .    on the other hand , the local anisotropy of pressure may be caused by a large variety of physical phenomena of the kind we expect to find in compact objects ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein for an extensive discussion on this point ) .    among all possible sources of anisotropy",
    "( see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion on this point ) , let us mention two which might be particularly related to our primary interest .",
    "the first one is the intense magnetic field observed in compact objects such as white dwarfs , neutron stars , or magnetized strange quark stars ( see , for example , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , it is a well - established fact that a magnetic field acting on a fermi gas produces pressure anisotropy ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) . in some way",
    ", the magnetic field can be addressed as a fluid anisotropy ( however , it should be observed that for the thermodynamic pressure of degenerate particles under the conditions of landau quantization , it remains isotropic @xcite ) .",
    "another source of anisotropy expected to be present in neutron stars and , in general , in highly dense matter , is the viscosity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at this point",
    "it is worth noticing that we are not concerned by how small the resulting anisotropy produced by the viscosity might be , since as we shall see below , the occurrence of crackings may happen even for slight deviations from isotropy .",
    "an alternative approach to anisotropy comes from kinetic theory using the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov equations , which admits a very rich class of static solutions , none of them isotropic ( ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advantages or disadvantages of either approach being related to the specific problem under consideration .",
    "the theory of polytropes is based on the polytropic equation of state , which in the newtonian case reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the isotropic pressure and the mass ( baryonic ) density , respectively .",
    "constants @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are usually called the polytropic constant , polytropic exponent , and polytropic index , respectively .    in the general relativistic , anisotropic , case ,",
    "two possible extensions of the above equation of state are possible , namely :    1 .",
    "@xmath6 2 .   @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the radial pressure ( see below ) , and the energy density respectively .    as it should be expected , the assumption of either ( [ p1 ] ) or ( [ p2 ] ) is not enough to integrate completely the field equations , since the appearance of two principal stresses ( instead of one as in the isotropic case ) leads to a system of two equations for three unknown functions",
    "thus in order to integrate the obtained system of equations we need to provide further information about the anisotropy , inherent to the problem under consideration . for doing that , in @xcite a particular ansatz",
    "@xcite has been assumed , which allows for specific modelling .",
    "this method links the obtained models continually with the isotropic case , thereby allowing us to bring out the influence of anisotropy on the structure of the object , even for very small anistropies .",
    "here we shall adopt the above mentioned ansatz .",
    "however it should be stressed that our models are presented with the sole purpose of illustrating the occurrence of crackings ; the natural way to obtain models , consists of providing the specific information about the kind of anisotropy present in each specific problem .",
    "the concept of cracking was introduced to describe the behavior of a fluid distribution just after its departure from equilibrium , when total nonvanishing radial forces of different signs appear within the system @xcite .",
    "thus , if we take a snapshot of the system , just after leaving equilibrium ( on a time scale smaller than the hydrostatic time scale ) , we say that there is a cracking whenever this radial force is directed inwards in the inner part of the sphere and reverses its sign beyond some value of the radial coordinate . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the force is directed outwards in the inner part and changes sign in the outer part , we say that there is an overturning .",
    "further developments on this issue may be found in @xcite .",
    "as should be clear at this point , the concept of cracking is closely related to the problem of structure formation @xcite .",
    "in the example examined in @xcite it appears that cracking occurs only in the locally anisotropic case whereas in the perfect fluid case , once out of equilibrium , the configuration tends either to collapse or to expand as a whole .",
    "furthermore it has been shown in @xcite , that for a wide range of models , cracking appears only if , in the process of perturbation leading to departure from equilibrium , the local anisotropy is perturbed .",
    "this result suggests that fluctuations of local anisotropy may be the crucial factor in the occurrence of cracking .",
    "thus , in the case of an initially locally isotropic configuration , the appearance of cracking shows that even small deviations from local isotropy may lead to drastic changes in the evolution of the system as compared with the purely locally isotropic case @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to study in some detail the conditions under which , cracking appears in anisotropic polytropes .",
    "we shall consider the two possible cases of anisotropic polytropes mentioned above , and our models are the same as those considered in @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we have to make some comments about the perturbative scheme , leading to departures from equilibrium .",
    "for the cracking to occur , it is imperative that the perturbations introduced into the system take it out of equilibrium . in other words",
    "we shall consider , exclusively , perturbations under which the system is dynamically unstable .",
    "one way to assure this , is to assume that the value of the ratio of specific heats of the fluid is not equal to the critical value required for marginal ( neutral ) dynamical stability .",
    "so , under perturbations , the configuration either collapses or expands . another completely equivalent way to achieve this instability consists in assuming that , under perturbations of density and local anisotropy , the radial pressure of the system maintains the same radial dependence it had in equilibrium .",
    "it is obvious that in this case the hydrostatic equation will no longer be satisfied",
    ".    it should be clear that assuming this lack of response of the fluid , i.e. the inability to adapt its radial pressure to the perturbed situation , is equivalent to assuming that the pressure - density relation ( the ratio of specific heats ) never reaches the value required for neutral equilibrium .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider two possible ways to perturb the energy density and the local anisotropy , namely :    * we shall perturb the parameter @xmath3 and the parameter describing the anisotropy .",
    "+ or * we shall perturb the parameter @xmath5 and the parameter describing the anisotropy .",
    "as we shall see , cracking occurs for a wide range of values of the parameters .",
    "even though polytropes are static configurations , we have to keep in mind that the appearance of cracking occurs when the system is taken out of equilibrium .",
    "accordingly , we shall consider spherically symmetric distributions of collapsing fluid , which we assume to be locally anisotropic , bounded by a spherical surface @xmath10 .",
    "the static limit is trivially recovered from the equations below .",
    "the line element is given in schwarzschild - like coordinates by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of their arguments .",
    "we number the coordinates : @xmath14 .    which in our case read @xcite :    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}}{4 } \\left[2\\nu''+\\nu'^2 -   \\lambda'\\nu ' + 2\\frac{\\nu ' - \\lambda'}{r}\\right ] , \\label{feq2233}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath18    where dots and primes stand for partial differentiation with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "in order to give physical significance to the @xmath21 components we apply the bondi approach @xcite .",
    "thus , following bondi , let us introduce purely locally minkowski coordinates ( @xmath22 )    @xmath23    then , denoting the minkowski components of the energy tensor by a bar , we have @xmath24 next , we suppose that when viewed by an observer moving relative to these coordinates with proper velocity @xmath25 in the radial direction , the physical content of space consists of an anisotropic fluid of energy density @xmath9 , radial pressure @xmath8 and tangential pressure @xmath26 . thus , when viewed by this moving observer the covariant tensor in minkowski coordinates is    @xmath27    then a lorentz transformation readily shows that    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    note that the coordinate velocity in the ( @xmath32 ) system , @xmath33 , is related to @xmath25 by    @xmath34    feeding back ( [ t00][t01 ] ) into ( [ feq00][feq01 ] ) , we get the field equations in the form    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}}{4 } \\left[2\\nu''+\\nu'^2 -   \\lambda'\\nu ' + 2\\frac{\\nu ' - \\lambda'}{r}\\right ] , \\label{fieq2233}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath38    at the outside of the fluid distribution , the spacetime is that of schwarzschild , given by    @xmath39    in order to match smoothly the two metrics above on the boundary surface @xmath40 , we require the continuity of the first and the second fundamental forms , across that surface .",

    "( [ enusigma ] ) , ( [ elambdasigma ] ) and ( [ psup ] ) are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a smooth matching of the two metrics ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ vaidya ] ) on @xmath10 .    the energy momentum tensor may be written as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the four velocity of the fluid and @xmath46 is a unit spacelike vector , radially directed .",

    ". the full set of equations describing the structure of these self - gravitating objects , in both cases , were derived and discussed in @xcite .",
    "all the models have to satisfy physical requirements such as : @xmath55    in what follows , we shall very briefly review the main equations corresponding to each case .      assuming eq .",

    "the situation described in figures 1 and 2 is representative for a wide range of parameteres ( for which there exist bounded configurations satisfying the required physical conditions ) .",
    "figure 3 exhibits further the close relationship , existing between the occurrence of cracking and the type of anisotropy .",
    "indeed , the smallest values of @xmath77 correspond to the deepest and strongest crackings , and to the weakest overturnings .",
    "furthermore , for the largest values of @xmath77 ( curves e and f ) there are not crackings at all , only overturnings .    finally figure 4 exhibits the occurrence of cracking for configurations that are locally isotropic before perturbation , thereby illustrating the fact that even slight deviations from local isotropy , may be sufficient to produce a cracking .",
    "figures 57 , which describe the results of perturbation through the parameter @xmath5 , lead to conclusions qualitatively similar to the ones mentioned above .",
    "the strongest and deepest crackings , and the weakest overturnings , are associated with largest values of @xmath157      the results of this case are depicted by figures ( 814 ) .",
    "the first four of these , correspond to the perturbative scheme through the parameter @xmath3 whereas the last three correspond to perturbations of @xmath5 .",
    "figure 8 describes the situation , for different values of @xmath77 . for the choice of parameters in this figure ,",
    "we observe that cracking only appears for the smallest value of @xmath77 , whereas for the two largest values , there is only overturning . for @xmath158",
    "neither cracking nor overturning occurs .",
    "this behaviour is confirmed in figure 9 .",
    "here we see how the strongest and deepest crackings are associated with the smallest values of @xmath77 . for some minimal value of @xmath77 , and larger ,",
    "only overturnings are observed .",
    "these are strongest for the largest values of @xmath77 .",
    "figures 10 and 11 also confirm the role of @xmath77 in the occurrence ( or not ) of crackings . in figure 10 , for @xmath133 , there are only crackings , which are strongest and deepest for the largest values of @xmath157 .",
    "in contrast , figure 11 only depicts overturnings for @xmath130 and different values of @xmath157 .",
    "figures 12 , 13 and 14 describe the situation resulting from the perturbation of @xmath5 . however , unlike the previous cases , for these three figures we have assumed negative values of @xmath159 .",
    "this explains why they only exhibit overturnings , and why these overturnings are stronger for smaller values of @xmath77 ( just the opposite of the situation observed for positive values of @xmath159 ) .",
    "we have investigated the conditions under which , general relativistic polytropes for anisotropic matter , exhibit cracking and/or overturning , when submitted to fluctuations of energy density and anisotropy .",
    "thus , we have shown that cracking and/or overturning occur for a wide range of the parameters . for both types of polytropes ,",
    "the main conclusions are basically the same , namely : the strongest and deepest crackings occur for the smallest values of @xmath77 and greatest values of @xmath157 . also , the strongest overturnings result from the largest values of @xmath77 .    a distinct feature of all the models studied here , is the fact that the `` core '' ( the inner part ) , and the `` envelope '' ( the outer part ) , respond differently to different degrees of anisotropy ( different @xmath77 ) .",
    "this fact was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the occurrence of a cracking , has direct implications on the structure and evolution of the compact object , only at time scales that are smaller than , or at most , equal to , the hydrostatic time scale .",
    "this is so because as already mentioned , what we do is to take a `` snapshot '' just after the system leaves the equilibrium . to find out whether or not the system will return to the state of equilibrium afterward , is out of the scope of our analysis , and",
    "would require an integration of the evolution equations for a finite period of time , greater than the hydrostatic time .",
    "one of these situations could be the collapse of a supermassive star .",
    "the occurrence of cracking at the inner core , would certainly change ( in some cases probably enhance ) the conditions for the ejection of the outer mantle in a supernova event .",
    "this will be so for both the `` prompt '' @xcite and the `` long term '' mechanisms @xcite .",
    "also , one is tempted to invoke cracking as the possible origin of quakes in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , large scale crust cracking in neutron stars and their relevance in the occurrence of glitches and bursts of x - rays and gamma rays have been considered in detail by ruderman ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "evidently , the characteristics of these quakes , and those of the ensuing glitches , would strongly depend on the depth at which the cracking occurs . in this respect",
    "it is worth noticing , the already mentioned fact , that the depth at which the cracking may appear , is highly dependent on the parameter @xmath77 , which measures the anisotropy of the pressure .",
    "however we would like to emphasize that our aim here is not to model in detail any of the scenarios mentioned above , but just to call attention to the possible occurrence of cracking in such important configurations , as those satisfying a polytropic equation of state , and its relationship with fluctuations of local anisotropy .",
    "in other words , whatever the origin of the anisotropy would be , or how small it is , cracking may occur , which would drastically affect the outcome of the evolution of the system .",
