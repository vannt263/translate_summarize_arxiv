    "in many active galaxies , the radiative power of the jet is comparable to that of the nucleus and the kinetic energy flux can be comparable to the bolometric radiative luminosity of the core @xcite .    while jets are commonly detected in radio images of quasars and radio galaxies , jet detections in the x - ray band were rare before _",

    "many of the new discoveries are low power ( fri ) radio sources , and bl lac objects @xcite . in luminous quasars such as 3c 273 and pks  0637 - 752",
    ", the jet physics is known to be different from that in low power sources , so it is important to increase the number of known x - ray jets in high power sources and , consequently , our knowledge of their range of properties .",
    "two groups are addressing this need through systematic surveys using _ chandra _ observations of radio - selected quasars ( sambruna , et al . ;",
    "this work ) .",
    "our survey was intended to discover whether radio jets commonly have x - ray emission that is as bright relative to their radio fluxes as in the brightest knot in pks  0637@xmath0752  @xcite . for the sources with relatively bright jets , deep exposures would then provide more detailed measurements of individual jet components , as has been done , for example , for pks  0637@xmath0752 , 3c 273 @xcite , m 87 @xcite , and cen a @xcite . in order to study particle acceleration and energy loss mechanisms in quasar jets ,",
    "we need to assess key issues , such as whether the particle energy densities are in equipartition with the local magnetic field energy densities and whether the jets have high lorentz factors in bulk motion oriented close to our line of sight @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe the sample selection in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe the _ chandra _ observations and compare the x - ray maps to newly obtained radio images . in section 4 , we examine the sample properties in the context of beaming emission models .",
    "we use a cosmology in which @xmath1 km",
    "s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we tailored our source selection criteria to generate a list of objects that have radio jets or nearby bright knots of suitable angular scale to resolve with _",
    "chandra_. we selected targets from two complete samples for which radio maps were obtained with @xmath5  resolution at 1 - 10 ghz : a vla sample of flat spectrum quasars ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ) with core flux densities at 5 ghz ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 jy and @xmath10  @xcite and an australia telescope compact array ( atca ) survey of flat spectrum sources @xcite from the parkes catalog with core flux densities at 2.7 ghz greater than 0.34 jy and @xmath11 .",
    "the portion of the sample derived from the atca survey is somewhat heterogeneous as not all sources are optically identified and two have redshifts less than 0.1 ; these low redshift sources are likely to be low luminosity fr i galaxies . only sources with emission that was found to be extended over scales @xmath12  were included as candidates .",
    "this selection takes advantage of the matched radio and x - ray telescope resolutions and of the excellent point spread function of chandra : @xmath13% of the core s power would be outside 2 , so the x - ray intensity from the core at the location of the jet is expected to be negligible .",
    "the extended radio flux densities were estimated for each object from previously existing radio maps of both samples and extrapolated to 5 ghz , if necessary .",
    "we then estimated the x - ray fluxes by assuming that the ratio of the 1 kev x - ray flux to the 4.8 ghz flux is the same as in the jet of pks  0637@xmath0752 , for which @xmath14 njy and @xmath15 jy .",
    "the predicted x - ray count rate is then about @xmath16njy@xmath17jy@xmath18 count / s in the 0.5 - 7.0 kev band .",
    "we observed sources from the northern list where the predicted counts would be greater than 30 counts in 5 ks . for a region of interest that is about 8@xmath19 2.5 ,",
    "the limiting count rates are much larger than the expected background of about 0.0001 count / s .",
    "the southern sample had more sources with bright extended flux , so the limit was set at 50 counts in 5 ks .",
    "these sources comprise our `` a '' list .",
    "a `` b '' list was also generated from these two samples .",
    "the selection criterion was based entirely on the morphology of the extended emission from maps available before starting the survey : the radio emission was predominantly one - sided and linear .",
    "this criterion extends our sample to predicted count rate that are lower than expected for the targets in the a  list .",
    "we include these sources in our list because we already know that radio surface brightness is not the only characteristic that sets the x - ray flux .",
    "knot a1 of 3c 273 , for example , has an @xmath20 ratio that is 10@xmath19 higher than for pks  0637@xmath0752  @xcite .",
    "the morphological selection criterion was efficient at picking out sources in the a  list , so that many a - list targets would also qualify in the b  list .",
    "we note that both target lists are drawn from flux - limited samples based on radio flux without regard to redshift or optical properties .",
    "our sample selection is somewhat different from that used by @xcite who selected sources from a list of known jets compiled from surveys of the literature .",
    "the completeness of the lists they used is not known .",
    "six of their targets are also in our sample but of the remaining eleven , seven do not satisfy at least one of our sample requirements and four are in the declination gap ( -20  to 0 ) between the northern and southern surveys on which we have based our sample selection . by selecting our a targets on the basis of extended flux without regard to morphology",
    ", we pick up more highly bent and amorphous structures than are found in the lists used by sambruna et al .",
    "since any literature - based sample is biased to the northern hemisphere , it is not surprising that many of our new targets are in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the full sample ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) consists of 56 objects , comprised of 9 sources in the a  list that are not in the b  list , 21 sources that are in both lists , and 26 sources that are only in the b  list . of the 56 sources , 20",
    "were observed as part of a _",
    "chandra _ observing program in cycle 3 , and are the subject of this paper .",
    "a few sources in the sample have been observed in other observing programs and results will be included in a future paper where we will also include results from the continuing _ chandra _ observing program .",
    "the observation dates and exposure times for the 20 targets observed in _",
    "chandra _ observing cycle 3 are given in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "events in the 0.5 - 7.0 kev range were selected for all analysis and to form the x - ray images , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] .",
    "the location of the x - ray core in each image was determined by computing a preliminary centroid by fitting gaussians to the 1d histograms obtained from events within 30of the core .",
    "the final centroid was computed similarly using only events within 3  of the preliminary centroid .",
    "the observed core count rate was estimated within a 2.5 pixel ( 1.23 ) radius aperture and the ( negligible ) background was taken from an annulus from 15 to 20  from the core . for this size aperture and the typical quasar core spectra ,",
    "the enclosed power is about 95% of the total power , so we did not apply an aperture correction to the observed count rates .",

    "acis was restricted to a 1/4 subarray with a field of 2  @xmath19 8  and a frametime , @xmath21 , of 0.8 s. in one case , 0208 - 512 , a 1/8 subarray ( a 2  @xmath19 8  field of view ) was used , for which @xmath21 = 0.4 s. for the brightest sources , pileup , which increases with frametime , may be a concern .",
    "pileup diverts the grades of good events into bad grades , reducing the apparent count rate and shifting events to higher energies .",
    "the count rate reduction is greater than 10% when there are more than about 0.25 counts per frame , or at about 0.3 cps ( 0.6 cps ) when @xmath21 = 0.8 s ( 0.4 s ) .",
    "there are three sources for which the _ observed _ core count rate exceeds the 10% loss count rate so that the reported count rate is systematically low by 10% or more : 1145@xmath0676 , 1828@xmath22487 , 2251@xmath22158 .",
    "we computed independent estimates of the core count rates using the acis readout streak .",
    "the streak occurs as x - rays are received during the acis parallel frame transfer , which provides 40 @xmath23s exposure in each pixel along the streak per frame . for an observation with a live time of @xmath24 ( yielding @xmath25 frames ) , a section of the readout streak that is @xmath26 arcsec long accumulates an exposure of @xmath27 s , where @xmath28  is the angular size of an acis pixel . for these observations ,",
    "@xmath29 ks and @xmath21 = 0.8 s ( 0.4 s ) , giving @xmath30 7.6 s ( 15.2 s ) in a streak segement that is @xmath26 = 15  long .",
    "for the three sources in question , the count rates estimated from the streak are systematically higher , as expected , although this is not significant for 1145 - 676 which appears to have a soft spectral excess ( table [ tab : coreresults ] ) .",
    "while the count rate determined from the 2d image is more precise , it is subject to larger bias due to pileup .",
    "by contrast , the count rate determined from the streak is more uncertain but less biased ; the streak - based count rates should be preferred for pks 1145 - 676 , 1828@xmath22487 , and 2251@xmath22158 . for 2251@xmath22158",
    ", pileup reduces the observed count rate by more than a factor of three .",
    "new radio maps were obtained for many of the sources at the atca or the vla .",
    "these will be reported in detail in a separate paper ( lovel , et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these new maps were used for the image overlays in figure  [ fig : images ] ( details of the radio contours are provided in table  [ tab : radiocont ] ) , and were used to determine radio fluxes for the cores and jets . for the overlays , we assumed that the radio and x - ray cores coincided in order to register the x - ray and radio maps to better than 0.1 .",
    "the applied shifts were @xmath5 .",
    "we tested for the existence of an x - ray jet using simple test based on poisson statistics .",
    "first , the radio images were used to define the position angles and lengths of possible x - ray jets .",
    "most jets are clearly defined as one - sided structures but in a few ambiguous cases , the pc - scale jets were used to define the jet direction .",
    "the inner and outer radii , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are given in table  [ tab : jetresults ] along with the position angle at which the region was centered .",
    "the width of the rectangle was 3  except for 1030 - 357 , 1655 - 776 and 2101 - 490 , where the jets bend substantially , so the rectangles were widened to 10 , 10 , and 5 , respectively .",
    "profiles of the radio emission along the jets were extracted and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radioprofiles ] . in order to eliminate the wings of the core but avoid counterjets ,",
    "a radio profile was determined at 90  to the jet and subtracted .",
    "next , the x - ray counts in the same rectangular region defined by the radio data were compared to a similar sized region on the opposite side of the core for the test , assuming a poisson probability distribution .",
    "we set the critical probability for detection of an x - ray jet to 0.0025 , which yields a 5% chance that there might be one false detection in this set of 20 sources .",

    "the jet and counter - jet position angles are compared , providing a qualitative view of the x - ray emission along the jets . in no case",
    "is a counter - jet apparent in the x - ray images .",
    "x - ray emission that is symmetrically distributed about a quasar core is ignored because it is either associated with the _ chandra _ point response function ( so it is more clear in bright sources such as 2251@xmath22158 ) or it is could be an indication of hot gas in the potential well of a galaxy or small cluster of galaxies .",
    "jet x - ray fluxes ( table  [ tab : jetresults ] ) were computed from count rates using 1000 njy per count / s .",
    "this conversion is accurate to about 10% for typical power law spectra .",
    "the spectral index from radio to x - ray is computed using @xmath33 , where @xmath34 hz and @xmath35 depends on the map used .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus of each source was measured using an extraction circle of radius 2.5 pixels ( 1.23 arcsec ) , with background measured from source - free regions from the same observation and the same ccd .",
    "spectral fitting was performed in the energy band 0.57 kev ; the low energy limit was set high enough to reduce any uncertainties in the acis contamination correction to an unimportant level . in each case",
    "the data were fitted with a power law with excess intrinsic absorption .",
    "the power - law slope , @xmath36 , is the photon spectral index , and thus is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the energy spectral index more commonly used in radio astronomy and in the inter - comparison of multiwavelength data .",
    "the x - ray results are given in table  [ tab : coreresults ] .",
    "the addition of a narrow k@xmath39 fluorescence line from neutral fe at a ( fixed ) rest energy of 6.4 kev and ( fitted ) equivalent width 220 ev improved the fit significantly in only one quasar : 1202 - 262 .",
    "the detection rate for this line is consistent with the findings by @xcite using the sambruna et al .  sample , who find it in three of 16 quasars observed with _",
    "chandra _ , particularly given that their observations were of twice the duration of ours and their quasar x - ray cores are typically somewhat brighter than those we observed . only two of our objects , 1828@xmath22487 and ( particularly ) 2251@xmath22158 showed the effects of pileup in the spectra , so for these sources we used the pile - up model in xspec @xcite .",
    "spectra of both these objects ( the brightest of our sample ) have been measured by earlier x - ray missions .",
    "our result for the photon index of 1828@xmath22487 ( 3c 380 ) is in good agreement with the value of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 uncertainty ) found over 0.22 kev by @xcite with rosat . for 2251 + 158 ( 3c 454.3 ) ,",
    "our measurement is somewhat lower than the rosat results of @xmath42 @xcite or @xmath43 @xcite , but in good agreement with bepposax results of @xmath44 ( 90% uncertainty ) over a more closely corresponding energy band @xcite .",
    "a third object also observed previously , 0208 - 512 , is reported from asca data to have a spectral index of @xmath45 @xcite or @xmath46 @xcite , and from bepposax to have @xmath47 ( 90% uncertainty , with an absorption feature at 0.6 kev of which there is no evidence in the chandra data * ? ? ?",

[ fig : corefluxes ] due to variability . the spectral indices between the radio and x - ray bands ( @xmath51 ) are centered on a value of 0.5 and the targets in subsample a are not distinguishable from those in subsample b , indicating that the morphology selection does not pick out targets with preferentially dim x - ray cores even though the extended radio fluxes are somewhat smaller .",

    "the results are consistent with early x - ray measurements of the cores , and support the conclusion that flat - radio - spectrum quasars have flatter average x - ray spectra than radio - quiet quasars , consistent with a beamed radio - related component contributing to the x - ray emission from radio - loud quasars ( see worrall [ 1990 ] for a review ) .",

    ". if the radio spectral index is @xmath39 , then synchrotron models with a single power law distribution of electrons can be feasible if @xmath68 but then the optical flux would also be bright , so that @xmath69 . our program of imaging using the magellan telescope @xcite places stringent limits on the optical emission from most x - ray emitting jets in the southern hemisphere , ruling out the single population synchrotron model .    using the ic - cmb formulation given by @xcite , we may obtain a crude estimate of the angle to the line of sight with some physical assumptions such as requiring that the magnetic field can be determined from the minimum energy argument .",
    "@xcite determined an expression for a combination of the bulk @xmath70 and the angle to the line of sight , @xmath71 , in terms of a few quantities derived from observables .",

    "is estimated using the length of the jet as @xmath84 and assuming a cylindrical cross section given by the diameter associated with the _ chandra _ fwhm : 0.75 .",

    "limits are given for jets that are not detected in x - rays .",
    "the angles are rather robust to many of the assumed physical parameter .",
    "for example , @xmath71 decreases 10% if @xmath72 increases 60% ( @xmath72 includes the estimate of the volume and filling factor , see eq .",
    "[ eq : b1 ] ) , increases 15% if @xmath107 decreases to @xmath108 hz , and drops 15% if @xmath39 is decreased to 0.70 .",
    "the angles range from 9  to over 40 .",
    "the values for the fr i radio galaxy , 1343@xmath0601 , are not realistic because the jet is not likely to be relativistic , so eq .  [ eq : beaming ] would nt apply .",
    "these angles are meant only to be indicative for the remaining jets ; better models would be obtained by fitting the spectra of individual knots within the jets . in this model , where @xmath109 is assumed ,",
    "the angles determined for the jets are generally small , often less than 20 .",
    "small angles to the line of sight are expected due to the sample selection ( e.g. , most are flat - spectrum , core - dominated radio sources ) .",
    "some of the cores show relativistic jets in vlbi images ; these would be apparently brighter than quasars with jets perpendicular to the line of sight and more likely to populate the parent flux - limited sample .",
    "the jet angle distribution depends on the assumed value of @xmath70 , which may also be distributed , so we have chosen a value which is close to the median of values determined from vlbi observations of quasar cores",
    ".    another potentially important possible source of variance is in the detailed shape of the electron energy distribution .",
    "because the radio band results from radiation by a different set of particles than produces the x - ray emission in this model , the derived beaming parameters would change if electron number densities do not follow the power law model .",
    "we can estimate the radio frequency , @xmath110 , where the electrons dominate the synchrotron radiation spectrum that upscatter cmb photons into the x - ray band to energies of @xmath1111 kev .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "b2 of @xcite :      where @xmath113 is the magnetic field in the rest frame .",
    "then , using eqs .",
    "[ eq : kdef ] and [ eq : beaming ] , we find a simple relation between the ratio of the synchrotron and ic frequencies , depending only on the luminosity ratio , @xmath88 :      values of @xmath110 were determined for each source and are given in table  [ tab : beaming ] .",
    "all values are between 5 and 35 mhz , which is well below the frequncies of the radio maps we use to measure the knots ( but above the synchrotron cutoff used to determine the synchrotron luminosity ) .    in the ic - cmb model , the x - ray flux increases as the local energy density in the cmb increases with redshift . from eq .",
    "[ eq : beaming ] , we expect @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpharx - z ] , we show the measurements and limits on @xmath51 as a function of @xmath116 , where we set @xmath117 for the source without a measured redshift . if the ic - cmb model were the dominant mechanism for determining the x - ray flux , one might expect to find smaller values of @xmath51 at high @xmath118 .",
    "no such trend is indicated in the data , which might just indicate that other factors dominate the distribution of @xmath51 such as angles to the line of sight and bulk @xmath70 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath51 at any given redshift can be quite broad , corresponding to a range in @xmath88 of over a factor of 40 near @xmath119 .",
    "there were no x - rays detected from counter - jets .",
    "this result is consistent with the ic - cmb hypothesis , where x - ray emission would only be observed from the approaching jet due to compton scattering into the line of sight .",
    "consider the ratio , @xmath120 , of @xmath88 for a receding jet to that of an oppositely pointed , similar velocity approaching jet .",
    "this ratio can be determined from equations  [ eq : kdef ] and [ eq : beaming ] by reversing the sign of @xmath23 :      the quantity @xmath23 is defined to be positive for the approaching jet and using @xmath122 , it is easy to show that that @xmath123 for all choices of @xmath23 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the inverse compton x - ray emission from a relativistic counterjet will always be weaker relative to the radio emission than for the approaching jet .",
    "detailed analysis of several of the brighter quasar jets shows that even the meager data for some of the knots already require large beaming factors and small angles to the line of sight .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the spatially resolved radio / x - ray seds of four sources from this sample to measure magnetic fields and relativistic beaming factors as a function of distance along the jet , and inferred the kinetic powers and radiative efficiencies of the jets .",
    "the minimum energy magnetic fields are estimated from the radio fluxes and approximate values for the angular diameters of the knots . as expected",
    ", @xcite found that the high x - ray fluxes required can be explained reasonably well in the ic - cmb model .",
    "the rest frame magnetic fields of the different jets were of order 10 to 20 @xmath23 g ; our values are generally smaller , 4 - 14 @xmath23 g , due to the larger regions used . the measured beaming factors of 2.5 to 10.6 indicate that the jet axes must be within 5 to 25  of our line of sight , while we find angles of 15 to 28  for these same sources using the total jet flux densities .",
    "the kinetic powers are of the same order as the core luminosities for these jets , and their radiative efficiencies are @xmath57 1% or less .",
    "deeper observations will improve the analysis of individual knots in these jets and provide an opportunity to test the ic - cmb model better by providing a measure of the x - ray spectra and perhaps additional knot detections .",
