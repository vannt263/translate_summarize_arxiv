    "theorems for quantum mechanics ) that quantum non - locality does not imply the possibility of faster - than - light _",
    "communication _ or any other way to violate the principles of relativity _",
    "operationally_. one could also note that in the nearly two decades which have passed since bell s statement , modest yet significant progress has been made towards generalizing sharp formulations of non - relativistic quantum mechanics to the relativistic regime .",
    "in fact , bell himself in a later publication @xcite suggested that the _ grw collapse theory _ may lend itself to a precise relativistic formulation , a feat that was indeed accomplished by tumulka @xcite , albeit only in a non - interacting setting ( but see@xcite and references therein for further developments ; see @xcite for a critical discussion of tumulka s model ) .. also , lorentz invariant generalizations of _ bohmian mechanics _ can be formulated , although for the price of introducing a preferred foliation of space - time ( which , however , can be generated by a lorentz invariant law and shown to be empirically undetectable @xcite ) .",
    "all in all , the understanding that has grown over the last few years is that there is indeed not a _ contradiction _ but a distinct _ tension _ between relativity and quantum non - locality and that this tension is not primarily characterized by the thread of superluminal signaling ( and the causal paradoxes that could result from it @xcite ) but , more subtly , by the fact that relativistic space - time  having no structure of absolute simultaneity and no objective temporal order between space - like separated events  is not particularly hospitable to the kind of _ instantaneous influences _ that , according to bell s theorem , the explanation of certain non - local correlations seems to require .",
    "( for a comprehensive discussion of the issue , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a simple argument substantiating said tension . )    in this paper , we want to discuss the possibility to alleviate the tension between relativity and non - locality by explaining non - local correlations as a result of interactions that are both _",
    ", `` propagating '' at a finite speed from past to future , and _ advanced _ , `` propagating '' at a finite speed from future to past . despite the technical difficulties inherent to such theories ( the most important of which we will highlight in our discussion ) and the philosophical reservations that one might have against retrocausality ( but which shall not concern us here ) , the great virtue of such models would be that they could provide a complete physical account of quantum correlations while drawing exclusively on the resources of relativistic space - time with particles interacting along their _ past and future light - cones_. in fact , it can be argued on the basis of time - symmetry that advanced + retarded interactions are really the generic case of relativistic interactions and that it s the empirical _ violation _ of this symmetry ( e.g. the absence of advanced electromagnetic radiation ) that requires explanation . and it has been speculated that such an explanation could parallel , or even reduce to , the statistical explanation of the thermodynamic asymmetry , accounting for the absence of advanced effects on _ macroscopic scales _ , while the time - symmetry of the fundament laws may still reveal itself on _ microscopic _ scales in the quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "( indeed , such an analysis , trying to establish the empirical adequacy of a theory with advanced interactions , is not without precedence . in their `` absorber theory '' , wheeler and feynman",
    "outline a statistical account of the radiative asymmetry based on a time - symmetric formulation of classical electrodynamics @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent , clarifying discussion . )",
    "the idea of accounting for quantum non - locality by admitting some form of retrocausality is not new , but has been advanced by various authors for many decades .",
    "nevertheless , it is rarely acknowledged as a possible implication of bell s theorem and even rarer to pass the threshold from a logical possibility to a serious option . on the one hand , this is quite understandable , considering how drastically the proposal contradicts our ordinary sense of time and causation . on the other hand",
    ", it would nt be the first time that new physics require a radical revision of our respective ( pre)conceptions .",
    "hence , the best way to challenge the status quo is to develop and discuss further physical models that can serve as an intuition pump and demonstrate that retrocausation , in the appropriate context , must be neither as incomprehensible nor as unbecoming as generally assumed .",
    "this is precisely what the present paper aims to accomplish .    by means of a simple toy - model , tailored , in particular , to the eprb experiment",
    ", we want to demonstrate , in a quantitative manner , that time - symmetric relativistic interactions can in principle account for violations of the bell inequalities _ without presupposing conspiratorial correlations _ between the experimental parameters and the variables related to the preparation of the system .",
    "while retrocausal models are in general very difficult to analyze , we will present an explicit statistical treatment , showing how and in what sense relevant predictions can be extracted .",
    "our toy - model , we emphasize , is neither able nor intended to reproduce all quantum spin statistics ( for instance , it will fail to do so for repeated spin - measurements in varying directions ) , but is used to explore the range of logical possibilities that is restricted by bell s theorem and to emphasize the chances and challenges associated with retrocausal accounts of non - locality .    finally , it should be needless to say , though we want to clarify nonetheless , that we do not engage in any futile attempt to evade the consequences of bell s theorem .",
    "the question today is no longer _",
    "if _ the principle of local causality is violated in nature but _ how _  and what this means for us as we move forward .",
    "the model is defined by the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the particles have an internal degree of freedom ( a `` hidden variable '' ) represented by a vector @xmath0 on the 2-sphere @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to this degree of freedom as the particle s _ spin_. 2 .",
    "a _ spin measurement _ in the direction @xmath2 can not determine the exact value of @xmath0 , but only its the orientation relative to @xmath3 .",
    "the result of a spin measurement is thus given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "+ we say that the particle has _ a - spin up _ if @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 and _ a - spin down _ if @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "+ we can disregard the special case @xmath11 , as it will have probability @xmath12 .",
    "one of the crucial lessons of quantum mechanics is that a measurement is not a purely passive process , but an invasive interaction that will in general effect the state of the measured system . here",
    ", in analogy to a projective measurement in quantum mechanics , we assume that a spin measurement influences the particle s hidden spin state by projecting it onto the respective direction in which it s being measured .",
    "that is , if the spin of the particle undergoing a spin measurement in the @xmath3-direction is @xmath0 , its spin immediately after measurement will be @xmath13 4 .",
    "we are interested in the statistics of the eprb - experiment concerning simultaneous measurements on a pair of entangled particles in the singlet state . to this end",
    ", we consider in our model an ensemble of pairs of particles whose initial spin - variables are prepared with opposite orientation in a random direction , which it equidistributed on the unit sphere @xmath1 . for any pair ,",
    "we denote @xmath14 a spin - measurement usually ends with the particles being absorbed in a screen or a detector shortly after passing the magnet .",
    "the spin state @xmath0 is subject to a",
    "_ pair interaction _ whose effect is such that a particle continuously rotates the spin of its partner towards the orientation antipodal to its own .",
    "this effect is manifested by an _ advanced and retarded _",
    "action of one particle on the other .",
    "this could mean e.g. that the interaction is transmitted by a medium  like a field or a massless particle  propagating with the speed of light towards _ past and future _ or that the particles interact _ directly _ along their _ past and future _ light - cones .",
    "+ to acknowledge the fact that epr correlations persist over very long distances @xcite  indeed , if quantum mechanics is correct , over _ arbitrary _ long distances  we will have to assume that the interactions in a particle - pair are _ unattenuated _ , i.e. unaffected by distance , and _ discriminating _ , i.e. unfazed and unscreened by any other matter , thus realizing two essential properties of what maudlin describes as the `` quantum connection '' @xcite or what , in other words , can be understood as a form of _",
    "entanglement_.    to realize this model , we can for instance consider an interaction of the following type : + for two unit vectors @xmath15 , their distance - vector is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the tangent - bundle of the sphere at point @xmath18 .",
    "then , assuming the particles have world - lines @xmath19 , we can set @xmath20    where @xmath21 are the _ advanced _ and _ retarded _ time , i.e. the solutions of    @xmath22    hence , the spin of particle @xmath23 at time @xmath24 is `` repelled '' by the spin of particle @xmath25 at the advanced and retarded times .",
    "this is an example of a direct particle interaction along past and future light cones ( fig .",
    "1 ) ( c.f . the wheeler - feynman theory of electrodynamics @xcite ) .    there is , however , one issue with this particular ( most simple ) example .",
    "being defined by a first order differential equation , the law is actually not time - symmetric in the sense of _ time - reversal invariant _ , thus undermining our best _ a priori _ argument for admitting advanced interactions in the first place . in principle",
    ", this flaw could be resolved by considering the analogous second order equation , while adding appropriate constraints on the initial condition , namely that @xmath26 ( on average ) . however , while qualitatively the same , the analysis of this interaction would be more complicated and our arguments will be considerably simplified by drawing on the first order differential equation . in general",
    ", however , there is a variety of conceivable interactions that could realize our model in the relevant respects , the most interesting of which might involve something like a quantum wave - function , though expanding on these possibilities would go beyond the scope of our discussion and , in fact , beyond the scope of this simple toy - model per se .",
    "figure 2 shows a sketch of the space - time diagram of the eprb - experiment as described by our model .        a pair of particles prepared with opposite spin move in different directions towards an apparatus ( a stern - gerlach magnet ) , where they undergo a spin measurement in directions @xmath3 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "these parameters can be freely chosen by the experimentalists right before the measurement . since the two measurements are assumed to happen simultaneously ( in the laboratory frame ) ,",
    "they occur in space - like separated regions of space - time , here denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 . according to our model ,",
    "the outcomes of these measurements are determined by the particles hidden spin state as they pass the device .",
    "we denote the corresponding values by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the result of the spin measurement on particle a in direction @xmath3 is then given by @xmath32 .",
    "the result of the spin measurement on particle b in direction @xmath27 is @xmath33 .    in the end",
    ", we are interested in the probabilities of the _ coincidences _ @xmath34 , respectively the _ anti - coincidences _ @xmath35 .",
    "we recall that the bell inequality ( in its simplest version , assuming `` perfect '' anti - correlations for spin - measurements in the same direction as predicted by qm as well as our model ) reads @xmath36 for arbitrary parameter - settings @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this inequality is violated for the correlations observed in the eprb - experiment ( for certain choices of @xmath37 ) thus implying , according to bell s theorem , that they can not be reproduced by any local theory .",
    "indeed , we can consider for starters the predictions of our hidden variable model _ without _ advanced interactions .",
    "this will serve as our point of reference as a completely _ local _ model .",
    "without advanced interactions , the initial configuration is a stationary point of the ( retarded ) dynamics and we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 , that is , the outcomes of the spin measurement depend only on the orientation of the initial hidden spin @xmath40 relative to those of the measurement devices . concretely ,",
    "we find : @xmath41 of course , we now know from bell s theorem that there can be no probability distribution of @xmath40 for which such a model will reproduce statistical correlations violating the above inequality . and indeed , a short calculation shows that for the assumed equidistribution of @xmath40 on @xmath1 and arbitrary ( coplanar ) angles with @xmath42 : @xmath43 and in general @xmath44 so that bell s inequality is always satisfied .",
    "( more precisely , one can see by a few geometric considerations that @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] is the acute angle between the vectors @xmath3 and @xmath27 . )",
    "let s now turn to the more interesting case and consider our model with retarded _ and _ advanced interactions .",
    "the key difference , of course , is that now the particles _ post measurement _ , whose states are affected by the external intervention of the measurement process , can have a retro - causal effect on the particles _ before _ measurement . to extract statistical predictions for this case",
    ", we will have to understand how the final spin states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , determining the experimental outcomes , result from the time - symmetric interactions between the particles .",
    "this will be essentially a combination of three different effects due to what is sometimes described as _ zigzag causality _ :",
    "1 .   _ feed - forward : _ particle a after undergoing measurement in space - time region @xmath28 exhibits an advanced action on its partner , reaching particle @xmath47 in space - time region 3 ( fig .",
    "the change in the spin - variable that particle @xmath47 experiences as a result is thus directed towards @xmath48 if the measurement on a yields _ a - spin up _ and @xmath49 if the measurement on a yields _ a - spin down_. the same holds vice - versa , with particle b in @xmath29 exhibiting an advanced action on an earlier version of particle a , rotating its spin towards the direction opposite to b s post - measurement state .",
    "we call this effect a _ feed - forward _ since , intuitively spoken , every particle receives a `` feedback '' of its partners future measurement result .",
    "2 .   _ preinforcement : _ after being affected by the _ feed - forward _ , the advanced back - reaction of particle b in space - time region 4 on particle a in region 2 will tilt the spin of particle a slightly towards the direction _ in which it is going to be measured in the future . _ the advanced action of particle a in space - time region @xmath50 has an analogous effect on particle b in space - time region 2 . for further reference",
    ", we call this effect _ preinforcement _  so to speak , a preemptive reinforcement of the future measurement result .",
    "+ of course , in a similar way , particle a in space - time region 2 has an advanced interaction with an earlier version of particle b , and so on ... but further down the worldlines , the advanced effects originating from the particles after measurement are more and more diluted and will affect the state of the early particles only marginally .",
    "inertia : _ since the early spins are largely unaffected by the retro - causal influences , the effect of the _ retarded _ action exhibited by the particles in space - time regions @xmath51 and @xmath52 is essentially to rotate the spins _ back _ towards their initial values @xmath40 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "in the course of these interactions , the hidden spin variable of particle a will vary within the convex set spanned by the vectors @xmath54 , while the spin of particle b will lie within the antipodal triangle on @xmath1 , spanned by @xmath55 .",
    "( for the first order equation , these configurations form an invariant set , since @xmath56 is always pointing into the interior of the respective triangle . for more general interactions",
    ", the following conclusion may hold only approximately or for short interaction times . ) hence , the spin configuration of particle a by the time it enters the measurement device will be of the form @xmath57 with positive parameters @xmath58 , whose precise values in every run of the experiment will depend on the details of the interactions and the experimental setting .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 can thereby be thought of as reflecting the effect of _ feed - forward _ and _ preinforcement _ , respectively . since _ feed - forward _ will , in general , act only for a brief period of time until the particles are absorbed in a detector and since _ preinforcement _ , in turn , is only the `` echo '' of feed - forwards , we assume @xmath61 .",
    "analogously , @xmath62 will be of the form @xmath63 and for simplicity we set @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    for the results of the spin measurements",
    ", we have to consider the projections of the final spins @xmath30 and @xmath31 onto the corresponding directions in which they are being measured , that is ( neglecting the normalization constant ) : @xmath66 yielding @xmath67    however , as we will see , this does not determine the outcomes unambiguously .",
    "the main technical and conceptual difficulty arising in theories with advanced and retarded interactions is that the laws of motion , in general , can not be formulated as _",
    "cauchy problems _ , meaning that the specification of _ initial conditions _ at one single moment in time ( respectively on a space - like hypersurface ) is not sufficient to distinguish a unique solution and thus to determine the system s complete time - evolution . in our model , this problem is manifested in the fact that while for any choice of @xmath68 there is a range of initial states @xmath40 determining unique final states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , there are also values of @xmath40 ( that is when @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 are small compared to the effects of _ feed - forward _ and _ preinforcement _ ) for which two or more _ different _ prescriptions for @xmath71 and @xmath47 correspond to consistent evaluations of equation and thus to possible solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "moreover , in these cases , there is a sense in which one could say that the measurement outcomes are _ retro - causally _",
    "responsible for their own occurrence .",
    "for further reference , we will call this phenomenon a _ self - fulfilling prophecy _ ( sfp ) .",
    "we emphasize that this underdetermination of the time - evolution by initial data is not a result of our analysis being too coarse , but an intrinsic feature of theories admitting retro - causal influences .",
    "we also note that while the possibility of _ self - fulfilling prophecies _ may be mind boggling , it need not imply the possibility of logical paradoxes ",
    "there is nothing inconsistent about the time - evolutions we consider here  though the thread of potential inconsistencies is something to be addressed in the context of a more mature theory .",
    "nevertheless , in addition to the philosophical headaches that might be caused by sfp , one very concrete difficulty that we have to face here is that theories in which solutions are not parametrized by cauchy data are in general not _ statistically transparent _ , in the sense that there is no obvious notion of a _ state - space _ on which one could implement a _ statistical hypothesis _ or define a measure of _",
    "typicality_. more simply put , in our case , since the measurement outcomes @xmath72 are not unambiguously determined by the initial state @xmath73 , their probabilities are not unambiguously determined by the statistical distribution of @xmath40 .    for this reason , we will have to resort to a more unconventional form of statistical analysis , leaving open the question what boundary conditions _ in addition _ to @xmath40 should be used to determine the time - evolution and how the resulting statistical description should look like in detail .",
    "while we can not assign to each @xmath74 a set of initial conditions @xmath40 _ sufficient _ to produce that outcome , thus implementing @xmath72 as a random variable on @xmath1 , we will consider for each possible outcome @xmath74 the _ necessary _ conditions in terms of the initial configuration @xmath40 , thus determining _ upper _ and _ lower bounds _ on its probability .      to this end , we will focus on the case @xmath75 , since quantum mechanics predicts that bell s inequality is always violated if the scalar product between any two of the ( coplanar ) vectors @xmath76 is negative , with the most pronounced violation for @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , observing that the problem is symmetric under @xmath78 together with an exchange of the particle labels ( and assuming that sfp respects this symmetry ) we can w.l.o.g .",
    "assume @xmath79 .",
    "now we can brake down all remaining cases corresponding to consistent solutions of eq . and",
    "thus to possible solutions of our assumed time - evolution . in the table",
    "below , we have listed for all @xmath80 the range of initial conditions @xmath40 that _ can _ produce the corresponding outcome :    .,width=529 ]    admittedly , this may still seem quite confusing , but the dust will settle in a minute .",
    "first , we note that unless @xmath81 is very close to @xmath12 or the ratio @xmath82 unreasonably large , we will always find that @xmath83 is greater or equal @xmath60 , meaning that we can disregard all the cases requiring @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , we recall that what we re ultimately interested in are the probabilities of the coincidences @xmath34 and the anti - coincidences @xmath85 . to this end , only the following cases remain to be distinguished : + 1 ) if @xmath86 then @xmath34 occurs ( almost surely ) .",
    "+ 2 ) if @xmath87 then : @xmath88    note , in particular , that our model predicts perfect ( anti-)correlations if the spins are measured in the exact opposite ( respectively the same ) direction .    comparing this to the local model without advanced interactions , where @xmath35 occurred if and only if @xmath89 , we see that now , in certain cases that would have been `` on the edge '' , i.e. where @xmath90 and @xmath70 have the same sign but either one of the terms is small in absolute value , the spin variable of the particles are rotated just enough by the retro - causal _ feed - forward _ to produce the coinciding event @xmath91 _",
    "instead_.    now a quantitative statistical analysis will , of course , require some information about the distribution of the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 . according to the specific form of the interactions",
    ", these parameters could vary in every run of the experiment , depending , in particular , on @xmath40 and the control parameters @xmath3 and @xmath27 .",
    "going forward , we will make the simplest possible _ ansatz _ which is that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not only the same for both particles in each pair , but constant throughout the ensemble of pairs , or , at least , distributed independently of the initial state @xmath40 for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath27 ( which is basically to say that the strength of the spin - interactions does not depend on the @xmath1-distance , i.e. the angle , between these spins ) . while one may object that this assumption is not only simple but somewhat simplistic , it will be fairly obvious that , qualitatively , our results will not depend on it too strongly . in any case , under this assumption , we can now determine an upper and lower bound on the probability of the anti - coincidences @xmath35 for given parameter choices @xmath3 and @xmath27 with @xmath92 .    * the _ maximal probability _",
    "@xmath93 is the probability of @xmath35 assuming that @xmath85 will occur whenever it is _ possible _ for an initial configuration @xmath40 ( or , in other words , that sfp always favors @xmath85 ) .",

    "we can conclude : @xmath95    where the factor of @xmath52 accounts for the case @xmath96 .",
    "this can be evaluated by means of the following identity that we derive in the appendix : @xmath97    for better illustration of the results , we will simplify things a bit further , still , by estimating the ratio of @xmath59 to @xmath60 , thus obtaining a parameterization of the final spin states @xmath30 and @xmath31 in terms of a single affine parameter @xmath98 $ ] . this is to say that we differentiate the analysis only by the _ strength _ of the advanced effects  represented by the parameter @xmath99  rather than by their dependence on distance or the duration of action , which could be dissected in a more fine - grained analysis by fitting the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "figure 7 below ) . setting @xmath100 ,",
    "a reasonable estimate is @xmath101 since _ preinforcement _ is a result of _ two _ advanced interactions , and hence @xmath102 .      in figure 6",

    "the growing spread between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is due to the fact that with increasing @xmath99 , the effects of _ preinforcement _ become more and more relevant and _ self - fulfilling prophecies _ thus more and more likely .    .",

    "median _ of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , corresponding to the probability of the anti - coincidence assuming that sfp is not biased between @xmath34 and @xmath85 .",
    "these values are plotted in figure 7  now , for greater generality , with the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 varying independently  to be compared with the predictions of the local model ( @xmath114 ) and of quantum mechanics ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "one of the most interesting things to note about this plot is that it does nt look particularly interesting  the values are rather steady except for the upward slope as @xmath60 and @xmath59 go to @xmath12 and the downward slope as they become very large  indicating a remarkable robustness of the predictions of the time - symmetric model against the details of the interactions .     and",
    "@xmath60.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] [ probminmax ]    finally , we note that there is no _ fixed _ choice of parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for which this particular evaluation reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics ( for the spin - singlet state ) for _ all _ values of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , that is @xmath118 of course , it wouldve been quite miraculous if it _",
    "did _ , given the overall crudeness of our statistical hypothesis .",
    "an interesting question might thus be whether by taking into consideration the possible dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath60 on the relevant physical variables , one could find a probability distribution @xmath119 for which the model reproduces eq . exactly .",
    "+ in conclusion , what our analysis shows is that the quantum non - locality we observe in nature in form of statistical correlations violating bell s inequality could really be understood as the signature of retro - causal effects due to time - symmetric relativistic interactions , rather than instantaneous ( or superluminal ) influences between space - like separated events .",
    "having seen that time - symmetric relativistic interactions can , in principle , account for the violation of the bell inequality , it is very instructive to reflect on how exactly such a model would fit into the framework of bell s non - locality theorem .",
    "we recall that the most general derivation of a bell inequality ( more specifically the chsh inequality @xcite ) is based on two ( and only two ) assumptions :    a.   _ the locality assumption _ : the statistical correlations + @xmath120 + between the outcomes of the space - like separated measurement events in the epr experiment are _ locally explainable_. by bell s definition , a candidate theory provides a _ local explanation _ of the correlations if conditioning on all the physical data in the ( causal ) past of @xmath71 and @xmath47 which , according to that candidate theory , could be relevant to the prediction of @xmath71 and @xmath47 , will _ screen off _ the correlations , meaning that the specification of @xmath71 and @xmath116 becomes redundant for the prediction of the probability of @xmath47 , and vice versa .",
    "formally , comprising all possible `` common causes '' of @xmath71 and @xmath47 in a set of variables @xmath121 , the _ locality condition _ reads : @xmath122 b.   the no - conspiracy assumption : the explanation of the correlations must not be _ conspiratorial _ , meaning that the experimental parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be chosen _ freely _ or _ randomly _ , independent of each other and of any other physical process that might be relevant to the system before measurement , hence independent of @xmath121 .",
    "formally : @xmath123        since our model violates the bell inequality ( as well as the chsh inequality ) it must violate at least one of these assumptions . in some discussions , a `` retrocausal explanation '' of the epr correlations",
    "is understood virtually synonymous with a `` conspiracy '' .",
    "however , the description provided by our toy - model is , all things considered , reasonable enough to show that the issue deserves a second look and indeed , on that second look things turn out to be a bit more subtle :    if , in our model , we condition the measurement outcomes on the relevant physical configurations in the _ past _ of @xmath28 and @xmath29  that is , on the particles initial spin - variables @xmath73  we find that the locality condition ( in form of `` parameter - independence '' @xcite ) is violated , i.e. @xmath124    this initial data , in other words , is not sufficient to screen off the correlations between the measurement outcomes on one side of the experiment and the parameter settings on the other . hence",
    ", a physicist seeking to explain the correlations between the distant events , as we usually do , by looking for a common cause in their past is bound to fail , and may reasonably conclude that there must be some sort of instantaneous influence between the two sides of the experiment . however ,",
    "if we lived in a world guided , on the microscopic level , by time - symmetric relativistic laws , this physicist , in doing so , would literally miss half the story , since the physical laws were such that the outcomes of the spin measurements were actually determined by the physical configurations in both past and future of @xmath71 and @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , if we condition @xmath125 on the initial states @xmath73 _ and _ the particle states _",
    "after _ measurement  which , in a time - symmetric model like ours , can actually be regarded as `` causing '' the outcomes  the probability , trivially , factorizes and the locality condition is , formally , satisfied .",
    "note that no assumption about the localization of @xmath121 actually enters the derivation of the chsh inequality , though it is only in the case that @xmath121 refers to configurations or events in the causal _",
    "past _ of @xmath28 and @xmath29 that we would speak of a local explanation in bell s sense .",
    "this is to say , in particular , that the concept of locality or local causality presupposes a distinguished direction of time . from a time - symmetric perspective",
    ", a more natural desideratum ( at least for theories that are not intrinsically stochastic ) would simply be the _ absence of direct influences between space - like separated events . _ and",
    "while our model is explicitly non - local in the conventional sense , it does satisfy the latter requirement which makes it arguably as relativistic as a non - local theory can get .    in any case , from _ this _ point of view , our model violates the bell inequalities  as it can not be otherwise  by violating the no - conspiracy condition .",
    "obviously , the physical variables screening off the correlations are not independent of the parameter settings , since they include the particle states _ post _ measurement which are collinear with the chosen orientations @xmath3 and @xmath27 of the measurement devices . however , we see no reason to deem such an account `` conspiratorial ''  at least not in the devastating sense argued by bell @xcite and others @xcite to essentially render futile the scientific enterprise .",
    "the fact that the state of the microscopic system after we have interacted with it reflects our experimental choices is hardly mysterious and in no way different from what we have anyway come to expect .",
    "more importantly , the advanced effects of the microscopic interactions do in no way infringe upon our freedom to choose the parameters of the experiment as we please ( or make the choice completely random ) , nor on the possibility to prepare a system ( it s initial state , that is ) according to a our liking and practical abilities . in other words , while formally violating the no - conspiracy condition , the account does not presuppose any dependence between the parameters associated with the preparation of the system and the parameters associated with the setup of the measuring apparatus .",
    "hence , it involves no conspiracy . +",
