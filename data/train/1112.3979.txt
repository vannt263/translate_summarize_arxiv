    "gravity in ads spacetimes is full of surprises .",
    "the presence of a negative cosmological constant manifests itself as an attractive harmonic gravitational potential well on test particles , leading one to visualise ( global ) ads spacetimes as a covariant gravitational box .",
    "one well - known consequence of this feature is the fact that the canonical ensemble for gravitational degrees of freedom is well - defined with ads boundary conditions @xcite .. ] another recent discovery is the fact that ads supports non - trivial geon solutions @xcite , which correspond to steady state non - dissipative condensates of bulk gravitons .",
    "some of these surprising features , such as black hole thermodynamics , are well understood using the ads / cft correspondence as a necessary consequence of the dual field theory dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , as exemplified by the geon solutions , in recent years various new surprises have been uncovered , mostly in the process of trying to model interesting exotic configurations in the boundary cft using the gravitational description .",
    "of primary interest to our considerations is the fact that asymptotically ads spacetimes admit solitonic configurations with non - trivial matter profiles .    to motivate the discussion of solitons in ads ,",
    "let us hark back to the view of ads as a gravitational box and consider linearised matter fields in this geometry .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that the eigenenergies of the single particle states are quantised @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the harmonic level and @xmath3 the rotational quantum number .",
    "@xmath4 is a zero - point energy from the bulk perspective and translates into the conformal dimension of the corresponding cft operator on the boundary .",
    "one naively imagines that it would be impossible to macroscopically populate the single particle energy levels to form a coherent condensate of such fields ( assuming they are bosons ) ; the harmonic gravitational potential will cause the particles to collapse to the center of ads and we should end up with a black hole .",
    "many examples prove this intuition to be incorrect . for one it is possible to balance the gravitational interaction by matter repulsion ( e.g. , by considering charged matter as we discuss ) or more simply by tuning the boundary conditions for fields at ads @xmath5 .",
    "since both of these ingredients will play a role in our considerations below , we now briefly review previous discussions of solitons in ads .",
    "the earliest construction of solitons in ads spacetimes was achieved in a very simple model of scalar fields coupled to gravity @xcite by allowing for non - trivial boundary conditions for the scalar field .",
    "these boundary conditions correspond to deformations of the boundary cft by multi - trace operators @xcite .",
    "once one is willing to relax boundary conditions , solitons can be made to order ; one demands that there be a soliton and works out what choice of boundary condition would allow it to exist .",
    "such constructions go by the name of designer gravity @xcite and have been extensively investigated in the context of positive energy theorems for ads spacetimes with multi - trace boundary conditions , @xcite .",
    "a different construction of solitons is to consider charged scalar fields in ads and allow the charge repulsion to compensate against the gravitational attraction .",
    "in fact , the equations for bps configurations preserving various fractions of supersymmetries in diverse dimensions have been known for a while @xcite and admit charged supersymmetric solitonic solutions .",
    "more recently , charged solitons which asymptote to global ads@xmath6 were constructed in a perturbative expansion in the scalar amplitude in @xcite within a simple phenomenological einstein - maxwell - scalar theory with negative cosmological constant .",
    "subsequently , @xcite and @xcite constructed a family of charged scalar solitons within a particular five dimensional truncation of type iib supergravity to five dimensions ( which is contained within the ansatz of @xcite ) . @xmath7 gauged supergravity in 4 + 1 dimensions , where equal charges were turned on in @xmath8 . ]",
    "our interest in this paper is with the global charged solitons in asymptotically spacetimes motivated by a multitude of observations .",
    "first of all , an interesting question is whether global charged ads solitons can get ` large ' i.e. , is it possible for the soliton size to be parametrically larger than the length scale @xmath9 set by the cosmological constant ?",
    "this question is not purely academic ; one of the surprises about gravity in ads is that when the characteristic size of gravitational configurations @xmath10 ( be they solitons or even black holes ) becomes large compared to the ads scale @xmath9 we can consider a scaling regime which takes us to solutions in planar ( poincar ) ads .",
    "this is of course well known in the context of asymptotically ads black holes and plays an important role in modelling thermal physics of the dual cft on minkowski space . in many of the known examples of solitons in ads",
    "this does not happen .",
    "for example , smooth charged solitons constructed in @xcite are always at most of ads scale and do not admit passage into the planar limit .. soltions which are charged under a single @xmath11 do get arbitrarily large  we are interested in understanding under what circumstances this can happen . ]",
    "this behaviour seems at face value consistent with the known results for self - gravitating fluids in ads @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of self - gravitating fluids it is known that there is a critical dimension beyond which the solitons can become parametrically large in ads units @xcite , indicating that weakening the gravitational attraction can lead to large solitons ( amusingly this critical dimension is around @xmath12 ) .",
    "a natural question then is whether one can have a different control parameter which allows solitons to get arbitrarily large .",
    "indeed one such parameter presents itself ; the charge of the bulk scalar field which controls the strength of the charge repulsion .",
    "a second motivation for our consideration is the fact that the proclivity of charged scalar fields in ads to condense , as originally shown in @xcite ( in the context of planar ads ) , plays a key role in the holographic modelling of superfluids .",
    "unburdened by the no - hair theorems which beset asymptotically flat black holes , planar ads black holes can be unstable to the formation of scalar hair as these authors demonstrated . in @xcite it was shown that black branes with charged scalar hair can be used to model the condensed phase of a superfluid .    in these studies and applications of ads / cft to finite density systems ( see @xcite for reviews of these developments ) one is interested in the behaviour of the cft in minkowski spacetime in the grand canonical ensemble , i.e. , at non - zero temperature and charge chemical potential ( both of which are held fixed ) .",
    "on the other hand , investigating such theories with global ads boundary conditions allows us to identify the cft states corresponding to the condensation of bulk charged fields .",
    "moreover , we can look at fixed charge sectors of the dual field theory and ask what the spectrum of cft states looks like from the bulk viewpoint i.e , chart out the microcanonical phase diagram .",
    "these considerations partly motivated the earlier work of global charged solitons @xcite , wherein it was argued that the global solitons are the true ground states of the theory with fixed charge .",
    "naively one would have expected that the ground state with fixed charge corresponds to a charged black hole in ads , but the fact that the scalars can condense implies that one exits the black hole phase and enters the phase of the charged solitons below a critical mass .",
    "however , the previous discussion of scalar solitons remaining bounded in size turns out to imply that the spectrum of smooth solitons terminates on a critical solution with maximal mass ( this happens even for the supersymmetric solitons of @xcite ) .",
    "equivalently in the microcanonical phase diagram one has a critical charge for the cft states .",
    "while one can certainly crank up the charge of the state beyond this value , it was conjectured in @xcite that for larger values of cft charge , one ends up with a singular global bulk soliton .",
    "given our earlier observation regarding the strength of the bulk scalar interactions ( equivalently the charge quantum number of the dual cft operator ) , it is interesting to ask what happens to the microcanonical phase diagram as we dial this parameter .",
    "returning to the context of the holographic superfluids , it is widely believed that solitons provide the zero - temperature limit of these superfluid black branes .",
    "for example , charged scalar configurations which asymptote to planar ads@xmath0 were constructed numerically for a restricted range of parameters in @xcite and were shown to back up this hunch .",
    "once again we have a poser : if for choice of bulk lagrangian one does not have a large global soliton , then how is it possible that we obtain a planar solution with a condensed scalar ?",
    "one possibility is that the planar solution descends from a singular global soliton as for instance argued in @xcite , but it is not clear if this is generic .",
    "more to the point , we need to address what class of singular global solutions are admissible .",
    "after all , if one was only interested in constructing solutions with desired ads asymptotics and was willing to be agnostic about the interior core region , then the problem is trivial .",
    "we would have solutions for any choice of boundary data by simply integrating in the asymptotic data to a timelike singularity . in this paper",
    "we provide numerical and ( some ) analytical evidence to connect global and planar solitons with hairy black holes and branes more generally .",
    "a final motivation for our considerations comes from studies of superfluid black branes within consistent truncations of supergravity ; the first examples of such in 3 + 1 dimensions were given in @xcite .",
    "many more truncations of @xmath13 @xmath14 gauged supergravity in 3 + 1 dimensions were studied recently in @xcite , where it was found that the behaviour and existence of solutions was highly dependent on the details of the truncation . for example , it was shown that within the truncation where equal charges were turned on in @xmath15 ( which is the analog of the truncation studied in @xcite ) , the hairless extremal reissner - nordstrm black brane dominates the grand canonical ensemble at low temperatures .",
    "this is despite the fact that one has new branch of hairy black hole solutions ",
    "these however turn out to be subdominant as they have larger free energy .",
    "the situation is in strong contrast to other truncations such as the one originally investigated in @xcite .",
    "during our study of solitons in these truncations we will also find clues to help explain this behaviour .",
    "one issue with consistent truncations is the lack of parameters that one can dial . while in phenomenological bottom - up models one has the advantage of using the bulk lagrangian parameters or equivalently positing the spectrum of the dual cft by hand , in supergravity consistent truncations these are a - priori fixed .",
    "however , the fact that we are interested in asymptotically ads spacetimes comes to our rescue ; we can relax boundary conditions on some fields ( and we shall mostly do so only for scalar fields ) to take advantage of multi - trace relevant operators ( if the cft admits such ) .",
    "for the examples we study this dial is present and as in the recent investigations of @xcite we can use this dial to explore the microcanonical phase structure ( albeit of the deformed cft ) . to a certain extent",
    "we will see that relaxing the boundary condition on scalar fields is tantamount to reducing the effect of the gravitational attraction ; its effect is qualitatively similar to increasing the charge repulsion or going up to higher dimensions .    with these motivations in mind",
    ", we undertake a study of charged scalar solitons in in three specific examples of bulk theories : ( i ) a phenomenological abelian - higgs model with a massive charged scalar , ( ii ) the consistent truncation of @xcite and ( iii ) a consistent truncation of 11-dimensional supergravity originally studied in @xcite ( and more recently in @xcite ) .",
    "we find a bevy of surprising results , most notably the fact that the spectrum of global charged solitons is a lot richer than what previous investigations would suggest .",
    "in particular , we show that even in theories where one encounters a family of solitonic solutions with a maximal mass , there appears to be a second branch of solitons , completely disconnected from the former branch .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the new branch of solutions is that they can not be ascertained by perturbation analysis about global ads as in @xcite ; in these solutions a macroscopic amount of scalar is turned on .",
    "moreover , in this new branch the mass of the soliton is unbounded from above .",
    "as we tune parameters of the bulk lagrangian or indeed modify boundary conditions , we see new critical behaviour ; the branches of solitons merge and subsequently split , leading to a rather rich structure .",
    "we not only tackle the behaviour of the global solitons , but also go on to show how these smoothly join up with the planar solutions constructed as zero temperature ground states for superfluids .",
    "furthermore , we also show where these solutions lie in microcanonical phase diagram , which itself exhibits interesting features .",
    "whilst it is tempting to conjecture that the solitons we construct are the ground states for the cft on @xmath16 at a fixed value of charge , this statement appears to depend sensitively on the theory in question . in particular , it can transpire in certain cases that one encounters global black holes with or without scalar hair which are lighter than a soliton at a given value of the charge @xcite",
    ". our focus will be primarily on solitons and we only briefly touch upon the nature of global black holes .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in with the basic set - up of the problem and describe the various theories we consider along with a discussion of the general features common to all examples .",
    "subsequently in we present a summary of our main results as a compendium for quick reference .",
    "we then move on to illustrate the details of our constructions in the following three sections : deals with the phenomenological abelian - higgs model , while and contain details of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 consistent truncations of 11-dimensional ( 11d ) supergravity .",
    "we conclude in with a discussion and our thoughts for further work .",
    "_ note added : _",
    "reference @xcite which appears simultaneously with our work on the archive explores in a comprehensive manner the microcanonical phase diagram of a phenomenological abelian - higgs model in .",
    "this work includes a detailed discussion of charged global scalar hair black holes , which we do not undertake in this paper .",
    "in this section we outline the general features common to all the theories we consider so as to set the stage for our discussion of solitons .",
    "we describe the bulk theories and the ansatz we work with , along with details of the choice of boundary conditions at our disposal . after a brief preview of known analytic solutions",
    ", we quickly review the planar limit of global solitons which forms a crucial component of our considerations in later sections .",
    "we will begin our exploration of gravitating global solitons in the familiar territory of phenomenological models for superfluid instabilities @xcite .",
    "this family of theories contains all the ingredients we require to build global soliton solutions , whilst providing some useful dials with which we can navigate the space of solutions . in detail",
    ", the family of theories are parameterised by the mass @xmath19 and charge @xmath20 of the scalar field @xmath21 supplemented by appropriate boundary terms .",
    "@xmath22 is the maxwell field strength and @xmath9 is the ads length",
    ". we will find it convenient to work with manifestly real and gauge invariant quantities , which can be achieved at the level of the action by absorbing the phase @xmath23 of the scalar @xmath24 into the gauge field , @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is real and @xmath28 .",
    "the equations of motion of this new action are the same as those arising from",
    ". follows from the maxwell equations , and is a consequence of conservation of the global @xmath11 current , @xmath29 .",
    "recall that @xmath23 is contained in @xmath30 in a gauge invariant manner . ] as we will see momentarily , the advantage of this form is that the action may be more readily compared with consistent truncations .    working with phenomenological models",
    "is instructive , but has a number of drawbacks .",
    "there is the concern that any interesting features might be artefacts of the chosen action .",
    "indeed , one could consider infinitely many alterations of the action . in a phenomenological context it is also more difficult to discuss consequences for any cft dual .",
    "for these reasons we also adopt two consistent truncations of 11d supergravity with the same field content . in previous work @xcite , global soliton solutions were constructed within a truncation of @xmath13 @xmath7 gauged supergravity in 4 + 1 dimensions , where equal charges were turned on in @xmath8 . here",
    "we will be interested in a lower dimensional analogue , employing truncations of 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath13 @xmath14 gauged supergravity .",
    "superfluid black branes for various truncations of this @xmath14 theory were considered in @xcite .",
    "we will consider the equally charged truncation @xmath15 @xcite and we will consider also a single field truncation first studied in @xcite ( the m - theory superconductor construction ) . whilst this latter single field truncation admits a @xmath31 invariance , it is part of a larger @xmath32 truncation @xcite explored in @xcite , as such we shall refer to this as the @xmath17 truncation .",
    "moving forward we employ a bulk action which is sufficiently general to encompass each of these theories : @xmath33 equations of motion for this action as well as the required boundary terms are presented in appendix [ sec : generaleoms ] .",

    "of particular interest to us will be the relevant double - trace operator @xmath68 which we will turn on to deform the cft , @xmath69 which is achieved by choosing @xmath70 such a deformation will be useful for exploring the structure of solutions arising in consistent truncations .",

    "however , for the single scalar truncation of @xmath17 there are two more located at @xmath83 . at this point",
    "we have another one - parameter family of exact solutions , @xmath84 which for @xmath85 is global ads@xmath0 with radius of curvature @xmath86 .",
    "we also find the following one parameter family of singular solutions in the @xmath18 truncation , parameterised by the @xmath87 scalar fall off , @xmath88 .",
    "the planar limit of this singular global solution will be discussed later and will play an important role in the supersymmetric solutions of this theory .",
    "@xmath89 this solution corresponds to a neutral soliton with no conserved charges , but has a non - trivial vev @xmath90  from the asymptotic scalar fall - off it is clear that there is no deformation in the dual cft .",
    "the solution above corresponds to a designer gravity soliton where the @xmath65 operator @xmath91 of the cft spontaneously acquires a vev breaking the @xmath11 global symmetry on the boundary .      in this paper",
    "we will be faced with families of global solutions ; indeed , we have already encountered some examples in .",
    "we will be able to construct planar solutions by taking a limit of these global families of solutions , if the appropriate limit exists .",
    "this will allow us to make comparisons with solutions in planar ads , many of which are already constructed .",
    "heuristically , the planar limit can be visualised as arising when the object of interest ( say the soliton ) becomes parametrically larger in size when compared with the ads scale @xmath9 ( here set to @xmath92 ) . in a sense",
    ", the object is reaching out towards the ads boundary and hence one can zoom into a local patch . as we do so , the effects of curvature become less significant and the boundary begins to look planar .",
    "of course , in the process of zooming we must ensure that masses , charges or vevs can be made sufficiently large , sufficiently fast in order that we do not end up in vacuum poincar ads .",
    "the goal of this section is to quantify this scaling limit .",
    "consider the simple example of the global solution , the @xmath93 case of : @xmath94 this is a one - parameter family of solutions ; a physical measure of the mass can be constructed by taking an appropriate ratio with the curvature scale of the boundary , for example . for a fixed solution on this branch",
    ", there is no analogue of the poincar ads scaling symmetry , which applied as a coordinate scaling @xmath95 alters the metric in the following way @xmath96 taking @xmath97 finite does not change the boundary curvature ; after all , we are only making a change of coordinates .",
    "however , if we take the singular limit @xmath98 of this coordinate transformation , then the boundary curvature becomes zero . in this limit ,",
    "curvature and mass terms disappear and we are left with poincar ads .",
    "if however , we simultaneously move along the branch of solutions , @xmath99 then in the @xmath100 limit a mass term survives @xmath101 namely , we have recovered planar .",
    "note that each choice of @xmath102 in is equivalent up to coordinate transformations , so it is a zero - parameter family .",
    "another way of saying this is that @xmath102 has scaling dimension @xmath103 , and without another parameter we can not construct a quantity invariant under the scaling symmetry ( where we now must include @xmath104 rescaling ) . it is important to emphasise that in order to obtain a non - trivial solution in the planar limit it was necessary to have a branch of solutions with an unbounded asymptotic coefficient . in doing so",
    "we have moved from a one - parameter family of global solutions to a single planar solution .",
    "similarly , we may obtain planar solutions by applying this procedure to the global solutions and .",
    "more generally we can consider a family of global solutions characterised by their asymptotic expansion .",
    "for concreteness we focus on a one - parameter family of solutions parameterised by @xmath105 .",
    "the asymptotic coefficients on these solutions will be functions of @xmath105 , and in general we will have five of them , may be set to zero by coordinate freedom in @xmath52 . ]",
    "@xmath106 with scaling dimensions @xmath107 respectively .",
    "if any one of these is unbounded from above , it is easy to show that a planar solution exists with a non - trivial asymptotic expansion .",
    "the global solution considered above is one example .",
    "the number of asymptotic charges that survive in the planar limit depends not only on whether that parameter is unbounded , but also on how fast it grows along the branch compared with other coefficients .",
    "let us work with scaling dimension @xmath92 quantities , @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the scaling dimension of @xmath110 .",
    "we require at least one coefficient to be unbounded along the branch , and in this regime we may study their growth assuming a power - law @xmath105 dependence , @xmath111 in particular we can choose our parameter along the branch , @xmath105 , to coincide with @xmath112 for the largest @xmath113 .",
    "then , in this new parameterisation , the coefficient @xmath112 will survive the planar limit if it scales as @xmath114 as we send @xmath115 .",
    "let us take the example of an unbounded mass , @xmath116 , growing fastest out of all five coefficients .",
    "we know at least that @xmath102 survives the limiting process . in order for the other coefficients to survive in the planar limit , they must grow as @xmath117 for example , the @xmath65 vev must be unbounded and grow @xmath118 at large @xmath102 , if we are to have a dimension @xmath92 vev in the planar theory .",
    "if at least two coefficients survive in the planar limit , they can be used to construct the physical parameters of the planar solution .",
    "for example , @xmath119 is a quantity with scaling dimension @xmath120 and is therefore a physical parameter on the space of planar solutions .",
    "the above results trivially generalise to higher dimensions : note that @xmath102 , the mass density , has scaling dimension @xmath121 in . from this",
    "we can infer an important point : for a conserved @xmath11 charge @xmath74 it is easy to show using the above that @xmath122 in .",
    "on the other hand the bps equations for supersymmetric solutions ( relevant in particular for @xmath123 ) imply that @xmath124 .",
    "thus if we had a global supersymmetric solution and consider scaling it to the planar limit , we will necessary end up with an @xmath85 planar solution . note that this general argument , based on scalings alone , does not exclude the possibility that a supersymmetric global solution can connect with a planar solution with @xmath85 and @xmath125 and in fact we will see an example of this in .",
    "of course , with such scalings there is a danger that the resulting solution with planar symmetry can be horribly unphysical : a case in point is the scaling limit of @xmath126 solution which leads to a zero mass , but non - zero charge planar singular solution .    in the following sections we will see examples of branches of solutions where all asymptotic coefficients are bounded , and therefore do not connect with the planar limit .",
    "we will also see cases where all coefficients grow in exactly the right way to survive taking the planar limit and an example where only the vev of the @xmath65 operator @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath88 , survives .",
    "the latter example will actually correspond to a supersymmetric solution scaled up to the planar limit consistent with the observation above .",
    "to guide the reader through the rest of the paper , we summarise the key results of our findings in this section , postponing the details to later sections . for brevity",
    "we denote the cft quantities characterizing the bulk gravitational solution ( parameterised by the core value of the scalar @xmath127 ) collectively via @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the adm ( boundary ) energy density , @xmath130 the maxwell charge density and @xmath131 the vev for the dual cft operator",

    "one is that they seem not amenable to a leading order perturbative construction about the vacuum ( see for the technical argument ) .",

    "those which were connected to the global geometry perturbatively . these objects were confined to an ads length scale , unless one countered the gravitational attraction by matter repulsion . in contrast",
    ", we showed the existence of new branches of solutions even for ` small ' amounts of matter repulsion . by examining the scaling - invariant quantities we were able to demonstrate explicitly that the planar limit of global solitons in phenomenological abelian - higgs theories matched up with the zero - temperature limit of planar black holes with charged hair .",
    "whilst these results were obtained for a particular value of the scalar mass , we believe them to be generic for other masses and also extend to higher dimensional geometries .",
    "we also showed that the features we see in the phenomenological models are also manifested in models that can be consistently embedded into 11d supergravity with minor modifications to account for the non - trivial matter interactions present in these examples .",
    "an important result of our numerical studies was the unveiling of critical behaviour in the family of solitonic solutions .",
    "this was particularly well - illustrated in the branch of solitons connected to the global vacuum .",
    "as we increase the charge of the scalar , the solitons go from being bounded in their asymptotic charges to large solitons that connect up to planar configurations . on the other hand one",
    "can directly study planar scalar hair solutions , which has been carried out extensively in the past few years , where one finds no peculiar behaviour as a function of the scalar charge .",
    "this observation led us to the discovery of a surprising branch of scalar soliton solutions : these have a planar limit but are disconnected from the global vacuum !",
    "we found a very intricate pattern of branchings in the soliton solution space as a function of the scalar charge ; solution branches underwent a series of deformations and even formed closed bubbles in solution space .",
    "such rich structure signals a rather intricate interplay of the non - linearities in the system and it would be intriguing to carry out a direct dynamical systems analysis to shed light on these features .",
    "there is by now a huge literature on asymptotically solutions in both phenomenological models and consistent embeddings of supergravity .",
    "we would like to propose that the method of constructing global solutions then ` blowing them up ' into the planar limit is a useful diagnostic in general .",
    "in particular , it serves as an efficient technique to find new connections between various solutions .",
    "we leave a study of this richer story to future work .    in the context of models that come from consistent truncations of supergravity / string theory ,",
    "the ability to choose multiple boundary conditions for the scalar field provided us with a different dial to tune in the consistent truncations we studied . in the context of holographic superconductors ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have already emphasised the role of this dial in providing access to new quantum critical behaviour . for the @xmath17 truncation discussed in",
    "we could show by using the double - trace deformations that the standard quantisation of the scalar field ( @xmath203 boundary condition ) was located at a critical point ; specifically , it exhibited features seen for the special value of charge , @xmath147 , in the abelian - higgs models .",
    "similarly , this same method also allowed us to elicit critical behaviour ( albeit of a slightly different kind ) in the @xmath18 truncation ( m2-brane theory discussed in ) for the supersymmetric ( @xmath65 ) boundary condition .    at the same time",
    "it should be emphasised that tuning of boundary conditions allows one to actually explore the phase space of solutions more completely .",
    "for example , in the m2-brane theory we would have not been able to find a new branch of non - supersymmetric solitons for dimensional one operators , without the ability to tweak the boundary conditions . more generally ,",
    "solutions that are disconnected from the vacuum are most easily obtained if we can access deformations by tweaking lagrangian parameters , boundary conditions , etc . , and then relaxing back to the undeformed theory .",
    "the hysteresis inherent in such relaxations enables one explore non - perturbative segments of the solution space .",
    "we should note that it is also possible to infer critical behaviour by other means : for example , for the m2-brane theory one can easily show that the supersymmetric solitons lie at a critical point simply by analytically continuing in the ` number of @xmath11 charges ' . to understand this consider which is the bps equation in the @xmath190-bps sector of the m2-brane theory with all four @xmath11 charges equal .",
    "the general bps equation for different values of the four @xmath11 charges was also derived in @xcite . in particular , we can specialise to solutions preserving higher amounts of supersymmetry by setting some of the charges to zero ; its effect if we restrict to the locus of equal non - vanishing charges is to modify the exponents in : for @xmath426 non - vanishing charges @xmath427 and @xmath428 .",
    "one can however study this theory for any @xmath429 and show that @xmath430 is a critical point ; for @xmath431 we see solutions that exhibit a slow but unbounded growth of the conserved charges as in , but solutions with @xmath432 have bounded charges in the branch connected with the vacuum .",
    "moreover , the toy model clearly shows how attractor solutions at large @xmath127 determine the phase space of solutions and also allows one to track the migration of the attractor solution itself as a function of the artificially introduced parameter @xmath429 .",
    "while such toy models have merit in enabling analytic studies , it is indeed useful for have more physical dials , such as the scalar boundary conditions , to explore the solution space .",
    "as an example of the utility of the global solutions , let us briefly mention an example on which we believe our results can shed some light . in a different sector of the @xmath17 truncation ,",
    "studied in @xcite , the authors found charged planar domain walls for one choice of scalar boundary condition but not the other .",
    "based on our results it seems likely that the two different choices should correspond to the planar limits of charged global soliton branches that have unbounded or bounded mass , respectively .",
    "it would indeed be interesting to verify this result , for while the specific truncation in question is more complicated than the single field truncations we have studied in this paper , it has the advantage that it allows interpolation between the vacuum of the m2-brane theory ( which preserves @xmath14 r - symmetry ) to a new supersymmetric vacuum preserving @xmath433 . in particular , we should be able to again see emergence of new global domain wall solutions interpolating between the two vacua .",
    "we have also discussed the location of solitons on the microcanonical phase diagram for various theories . for the supersymmetric quantisation of the m2-brane theory ,",
    "it is clear that global solitons form the microcanonical phase boundary because they saturate the bps bound .",
    "we have refrained however from making a similar conjecture for the abelian - higgs model because in certain cases one can find global hairy black holes that are lighter than a soliton at a given value of the charge ; a more compete discussion of this issue should appear in @xcite . whilst we have not explicitly studied global hairy black holes in the @xmath17 truncation , we suspect that they will have higher mass in comparison to a solitonic solution at a fixed value of the charge : we in fact conjecture that in this model that microcanonical phase boundary is set by the scalar solitons that we have constructed herein . more generally , it would be interesting to ascertain whether the exponential scalar potentials encountered in consistent truncations models necessitates the solitons being the minimal mass solution in a given charge sector .    as emphasised in the analysis of solutions in global",
    "has the advantage of allowing one to explore finite size effects in a large @xmath360 field theory .",
    "while much of the recent literature of applications of ads / cft to condensed matter systems has been restricted to the poincar patch , it would be useful to generalise the constructions to the global geometry where we have a covariant ir regulator in the spacetime .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to undertake the study of low temperature superfluid behaviour in a strongly - coupled theory on @xmath434 . similarly , it would be of interest to extend consideration of gravitationally interacting fermionic systems to the global setting .    the solitonic solutions discussed here are as elaborated in coherent condensates of bosons , carrying macroscopic charges in the dual field theory .",
    "in a strongly coupled system at finite volume , one generically expects that systems should thermalise ( in a microcanonical sense at fixed charges ) .",
    "it is rather curious that the non - linear interactions of gravity allow for non - thermal , i.e. , non - black hole solutions . which exhibit undamped collective oscillations ( oscillons ) @xcite ; for one our solutions are globally static . ]",
    "generic initial data for matter fields with asymptotically ads boundary conditions is expected to collapse into a black hole @xcite ; this has indeed be verified for neutral scalar fields in @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to delineate the class of fine tuned initial data which does not thermalise in the strongly coupled field theory dual .    finally , let us comment on an interesting application of our results to the study of supersymmetric states in the ads / cft correspondence . while solutions preserving 4 or more supercharges are by now well - understood , one interesting open issue in the ads / cft correspondence relates to the microscopic understanding of supersymmetric black holes , that preserve 2 supercharges .",
    "for example in the m2-brane theory discussed in this paper , these solutions would be @xmath435-bps",
    ". it would be interesting to ask whether there are solitonic solutions which preserve such low amounts of supersymmetry and if so what their role is in the dual field theory .",
    "for the specific case of this is an interesting challenge : the solutions by virtue of the bps condition are required to carry non - vanishing angular momentum , and this in particular makes them co - homogeneity two ( the metric and other functions depend on both the radial coordinate and the polar angle of the @xmath45 ) .",
    "preliminary investigations of a simpler set of examples in , where the presence of two rotation planes allows for co - homogeneity one solutions , was reported in @xcite , who studied such within perturbation theory .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the analysis to a full numerical investigation to flesh out the intricacies of supersymmetric objects in .",

    "the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the theories of interest are listed in table [ theorytable ] .",
    "we find @xmath436    we must supplement our bulk action with appropriate boundary terms : our total action is @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the collection of scalar and maxwell boundary terms necessary for a good variational principle ( we have explicitly indicated the gibbons - hawking term ) .",
    "@xmath439 is an expression covariant in intrinsic boundary quantities designed to render the on - shell action finite .",
    "the boundary terms for einstein - scalar theories with multi - trace boundary conditions for scalars were originally derived using the covariant phase space formalism in @xcite and extended to include maxwell fields in @xcite . by analyzing the asymptotic behaviour of various fields",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the counter terms of interest are independent of @xmath34 and depend only on the quadratic approximation to @xmath35 .",

    "we thus directly borrow the results of these references and quote the final answer without further derivation below .",
    "the main quantity we require is the adm energy density @xmath102 which we use to characterise our solutions .",

    "note that in exactly the dimension 1 and dimension 2 cases we have @xmath442 .",
    "the total energy of the solutions is @xmath443 ; we prefer to use the energy density since it is more naturally suited to analyzing the planar limit .",
    "the other conserved charge of interest , the charge density , is obtained simply from the fall - off of the gauge field  it is given by @xmath74 in .",
    "in this short appendix we explain the strategy to construct global solitons in a perturbation expansion around the vacuum .",
    "the first construction of such solutions was presented in @xcite and we will effectively be reviewing the same for our models .",
    "the general logic of our construction is independent of the details of the scalar field , though both @xmath35 and @xmath34 will enter into the details of the perturbation theory .",
    "the starting point for such a construction is the fact that the eigenmodes of the charged scalar field in global have frequencies @xmath444 with @xmath2 as long as we maintain spherical symmetry . actually , we will be interested in the ground state soliton , so we also have the luxury of setting @xmath445 .",
    "this ground state is then characterised by the zero - point energy @xmath4 which is of course determined solely by the scalar mass via the standard formula @xmath446 , where we are restricting attention to @xmath447 i.e. , .",
    "we will also have need of the scalar wave - function , which for @xmath448 takes a simple form : the scalar profiles which solve the linearised wave - equation are hypergeometric functions ] @xmath449 this wave - function is clearly regular at the origin and satisfies @xmath450 as @xmath50 .",
    "since we noted that the scalar field here has a nontrivial ground state energy , a neutral scalar field will also have a temporal oscillation with frequency @xmath451 which is a pure phase .",
    "for a charged scalar field this phase can be absorbed into a background gauge field ( by the same trick we used in writing the lagrangian in ) .",
    "essentially all we need to do is turn on a constant background gauge field tuned such that we mock up the phase .",
    "the upshot of this discussion is that there is a static perturbation around the global geometry ( with @xmath81 ) where @xmath452 assuming that for small @xmath27 , @xmath453 .",
    "this is all the data we need to set up the perturbation expansion .",
    "denote by @xmath454 the vev of the dual operator in the field theory ; i.e. , @xmath455  this will be the small parameter we will use to study perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbative solution ansatz can be written as ( treating both @xmath65 and @xmath64 together ) : @xmath456 where for brevity we define @xmath457 .",
    "it is a simple matter to iteratively solve for the corrections @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 , @xmath461 by recursively solving the equations order by order in powers of @xmath454 .",
    "most of the analysis is in fact analytical , because the linearised equations admit closed - form solutions .",
    "the integration constants are all fixed by the choice of boundary conditions : regularity at the origin and normalizability at asymptopia ( which we take to also include the scalar boundary condition provided in terms of the fall - off condition ) .",
    "we now simply quote the results of such a construction for the abelian - higgs model discussed in .",
    "the physical parameters characterizing the solution which are of interest are all expressed as functions of @xmath462 . for the @xmath64 boundary condition",
    "we find @xmath463 while the @xmath65 boundary condition leads to @xmath464 note that we have quoted here the results parameterised by the vev of the cft operator which is the natural parameter for the perturbation expansion .",
    "it is possible to set up the perturbation directly in terms of the core scalar value , @xmath127 but that appears to be a bit more cumbersome .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether solitons with multi - trace boundary conditions can be constructed using a similar perturbative expansion .",
    "one might naively have thought this to be possible ; after all the multi - trace operators correspond to multi - particle states in the bulk via the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "consider then the case where we impose a double - trace boundary condition @xmath465 .",
    "what we would like to do is find a regular two particle wave - function that in the linear approximation is regular at the origin and satisfies the asymptotic boundary condition mentioned above .",
    "this turns out to be impossible around the vacuum solution , viz . ,",
    "global , for reasons we explain below .",
    "previously , we wrote down the linear eigenmodes for the scalar wave operator , where we had imposed regularity at the origin .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath448 the solutions to the linear wave equations for static spherically symmetric configurations about are @xmath466 for the standard boundary condition ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) the ground state wave function was given by the first line with @xmath467 and @xmath468 while the alternate boundary condition ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) involved a seed solution with @xmath469 and @xmath470 .",
    "the double - trace deformation of the dual cft involves @xmath471 which should correspond to a two - particle state .",
    "the naive wave - function for this appears to be simply @xmath472 which can be viewed for the moment as @xmath473 .",
    "fortuitously , this is a static mode once we set @xmath474 ; this is natural since we are dealing with a two particle state ( so the net charge is doubled ) .",
    "however , this can not be the full story  the mode in question does not satisfy the asymptotic boundary condition . note that double - trace boundary condition requires that we have @xmath475 .",
    "inspecting it is immediately clear that there is no linearised solution that is both regular at the origin and satisfies the asymptotic fall - off ( for one we can not simply set @xmath476 and @xmath477 as it it irregular at the origin ) .",
    "the absence of a seed solution with correct boundary conditions makes it clear that it is not possible to set up a perturbation series analogous to the single trace boundary condition .",
    "we believe this is because of the peculiar nature of the multi - trace boundary conditions  while they naively correspond to multi - particle state in the field theory , such states rather than being described by a new bulk effective field ( which should roughly speaking be @xmath478 ) are rather described by imposing a local relation between boundary fall - offs .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of issues arising with double - trace fermonic operators as recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "we hope to return to a proper resolution of this issue in the future .",
    "conceptually , the breakdown of perturbation theory around global is not too hard to understand .",
    "while one can easily see this geometry ( and the dual cft vacuum ) being the appropriate state to expand around for single trace operators , it is no longer the case when we have an explicit deformation in the cft lagrangian .",
    "if one has a candidate ground state for the deformed cft , then we would be able to undertake a perturbation analysis about it .",
    "the trouble is that constructing the appropriate bulk geometry usually involves numerical solving of the field equations . in the bulk of the paper we have",
    "side - stepped this question by direct numerical integration of the field equations with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "it would indeed be interesting to find examples where we can adapt perturbation theory techniques to multi - trace deformed field theories .",
