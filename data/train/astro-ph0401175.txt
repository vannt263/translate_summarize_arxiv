    "to measure the mass profiles of early - type galaxies is not as straightforward as in the case of spiral galaxies , where a more or less orderly rotating disk allows a comparatively easy derivation of the rotation curve ( see sofue & rubin @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the inclination of a stellar or hi disk , which in principle can be measured by the axis ratio , leads to the deprojection of the observed radial velocities and almost circular orbits directly yield the circular velocities @xmath7 :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the constant of gravitation , @xmath10 the galactocentric distance , and @xmath11 the mass within @xmath10 .",
    "such favourable conditions do not exist for elliptical galaxies .",
    "an elliptical galaxy can in reality be axisymmetric when appearing round in projection .",
    "further complications can result from non - symmetric structure due to recent merger events .",
    "moreover , the distribution of stellar orbits is a priori unknown ( see de zeeuw @xcite for an introduction to the dynamics of elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "therefore , much effort has been devoted to develop more sophisticated stellar dynamical methods in order to derive @xmath11 for elliptical galaxies from the analysis of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( e.g. dejonghe @xcite , van der marel & franx @xcite , gerhard @xcite , bender et al .",

    "one of the most important objectives is to prove the existence of dark matter halos and to investigate their structure .",

    "one faces a further problem in the case of elliptical galaxies : while easily observable objects for determining the rotation curves of spirals sometimes extend to large galactocentric radii ( larger than 50 kpc ) , the rapidly declining brightness of the light profile of ellipticals rarely allows spectroscopic work beyond 1.5 effective radii .",

    "the spectroscopic observations have been performed in the period 11/30 - 12/2 2000 at the very large telescope of the european southern observatory at cerro paranal with unit telescope 2 ( kueyen ) .",
    "the instrument was the focal reducer fors2 equipped with the mask exchange unit ( mxu ) , which allows the use of up to ten slit masks during the night ( for details see http://www.eso.org/instruments/fors/userman/ ) .",
    "the grism in use was , for all but one mask , 600b , giving a spectral resolution of about 2.5  , based on the widths of the arc calibration lines . for one mask",
    ", we used grism 300v , which gave a resolution of about 5  .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on he - ar lamp spectra . the spectral range covered about 2000  .",
    "however , depending on the position of a given slit in the mask , the limiting wavelengths can be as short as 3500  and as long as 6500  . in most cases ,",
    "the grism efficiency degraded the signal - to - noise shortwards of 3800  drastically , so this region could not be used .",
    "we exposed 13 masks ( exposure times were either 1@xmath20 or 2@xmath2045 min per mask ) .",
    "the fwhm of objects along the slit ranged from 0.6@xmath21 to 0.9@xmath21 .",
    "the total number of spectra obtained is 1462 .",
    "this sample is composed of 531 sky spectra , 512 spectra of cluster candidates , 190 spectra of point sources of unknown nature at the time of mask preparation ( stars , unresolved galaxies or clusters not matching the selection criteria ) , 176 galaxies , and 53 `` bright '' objects , mainly stars needed to adjust the mask .",
    "since some objects ( about 80 ) have been observed in two different masks in order to assess the errors , the total number of objects is smaller by this number than the number of spectra .",
    "we anticipate here that the final sample of cluster velocities comprises 468 objects .",
    "we used two different techniques to measure the radial velocities : a cross - correlation technique and direct measurements of line positions .",
    "+ for cross - correlation , we needed a template with a high s / n and a spectrum resembling that of a globular cluster .",
    "ngc 1399 itself is not suitable due to its high velocity dispersion .",
    "we therefore chose ngc 1396 as a template , which has a high s / n ( about 30 ) and , as a dwarf elliptical galaxy , has a spectrum like a metal - rich globular cluster .",
    "regarding line - measurements , we defined a set of about 20 easily identifiable features ( for which only a few remained in faint spectra ) and used the iraf task `` rvidlines '' for measuring the radial velocities . in some cases , it was only possible to get a velocity by cross - correlation and not by lines . for a more detailed discussion of the errors ,",
    "we refer the reader to paper iii .",
    "[ errorplot ] plots our uncertainties against the cluster magnitude . for comparison",
    "we also include the m87 sample from hanes et al .",
    "the total number of clusters for which we have velocities is 508 .",
    "however , there are 40 objects for which we could not find a correlation velocity and 49 objects for which we could not derive a velocity by line positions due to low s / n . in the following , we prefer to use only the correlation velocities for reasons of homogeneity and because they have smaller uncertainties . however , in the case of low s / n , the uncertainty may be underestimated , since we used the width of the correlation peak to estimate the error .    for our template galaxy ngc 1396 , we derive a heliocentric radial velocity of 815 @xmath2 8 km / s .",
    "this is marginally in agreement with the value of 857@xmath237 km / s , given by da costa et al .",
    "@xcite , not in agreement with 894@xmath229 km / s from the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "better agreement is reached with 836@xmath232 km / s , the value from the nearby early - type galaxies survey ( enear , wegner et al .",
    "our value is in very good agreement with 808@xmath222 km / s given by drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite . as for ngc 1399 itself ,",
    "one finds 9 measurements of its radial velocity with quoted uncertainties consulting the nasa / ipac extragalactic database . after skipping two of them ( one has a discrepant value and the other a large uncertainty of 200 km / s ) , the weighted mean value is 1442@xmath29 km / s .",
    "the enear - value is 1425@xmath215 km / s .",
    "our mean radial velocity of the entire cluster sample is 1441@xmath215 km / s , so we are confident of our absolute velocity calibration .",
    "fig.[distribution ] shows the distribution on the sky of all clusters for which velocities could be measured by cross - correlation .",
    "since not all prepared masks could be observed , some gaps remain , most strikingly in the south - east quadrant . due to the increasing background of the galaxy light , we avoided targets with galactocentric distances smaller than about 2@xmath5 .",
    "our most distant object lies almost 10@xmath5 from the center of ngc 1399 .      because we use the bimodality in the color distribution of clusters to divide them into two populations , we briefly comment on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "a bimodal color distribution is a frequent feature of globular cluster systems ( for recent work see larsen et al .",
    "@xcite and kundu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of ngc 1399",
    ", it has already been seen by kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite , forbes et al .",
    "@xcite and ostrov et al .",
    "fig.[cmd ] gives the washington cmd for almost all of our spectroscopic sample . for 32 clusters",
    ", we have no photometry for various reasons , mainly because these objects were located in gaps of the undithered mosaic frames .    in this cmd ,",
    "the color bimodality is not visible .",
    "it is , however , very striking in the complete photometry of paper i. but also there , the bimodality disappears for objects brighter than r=21 mag and the majority of these bright clusters are found at intermediate colors .",
    "we note ( as discussed in more detail in paper i ) that the bimodality does not necessarily imply the existence of two and only two different populations : only the blue ( metal - poor ) peak lies on the linear part of the color - metallicity relation and corresponds to a peak in metallicity . on the red ( metal - rich ) end ,",
    "the relation between color and metallicity becomes non - linear and finally flat .",
    "this causes a peak at an almost universal color under a broad range of metallicity distributions and is not easily interpretable as a corresponding peak in metallicity .",
    "whatever the nature of the bimodality is , it is well known from many studies that metal - rich clusters behave differently from metal - poor clusters .",
    "for example , the blue clusters tend to show a flatter spatial distribution than the red clusters ( see harris @xcite for a review ) . furthermore",
    ", the kinematics tend to be different between the red and blue clusters . in the m87 cluster system , for instance , metal - rich clusters seem to show preferentially radial orbits , while the orbits of metal - poor clusters are more tangentially biased ( ct et al .",
    "@xcite , but see our corresponding remarks in section 5 ) .",
    "following paper i , we define @xmath22 = 1.6 as the distinguishing color between red and blue clusters . according to the washington calibration of harris & harris @xcite",
    ", this color corresponds to a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -0.6 dex .      in fig .",
    "[ disptot ] , we show the velocity distribution of the entire sample of 468 objects ( upper left panel ) . the bin size has been chosen to be 70 km / s , larger than the mean error , but still of satisfactory resolution .",
    "the upper right panel shows an error selected sample ( @xmath4 50 km / s ) demonstrating that the distribution keeps its shape under error selection .",
    "the lower panel shows an inner sample ( left ) and an outer sample ( right ) .",
    "obvious foreground stars with radial velocities of less than 300 km / s are omitted , but are listed in the accompanying data paper .",
    "for the full sample the mean velocity and its standard deviation are 1441 km / s and 329 km / s , respectively ( note that the velocity dispersions will turn out slightly different ) .",
    "this should be compared with the values [ 1429@xmath245 km / s ; 373 km / s ] given by kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite from their sample of 76 gcs .    at first glance",
    ", the shape of the distribution does not look very gaussian .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test gives a probability of only 0.1 that it is drawn from a gaussian with the above center and dispersion .",
    "the maximum probability of 0.57 is given by a dispersion of 298 km / s .",
    "one non - gaussian feature is that the distribution does not peak at its mean velocity , a fact also seen in the sample of kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite . in their fig .",
    "2 , a second peak appears at a velocity of 1800 km / s .",
    "also in our sample a small peak is found at this velocity .",
    "it remains there also with lower bin width , but its significance is doubtful .",
    "the only striking feature is that it is made up of predominantly blue clusters which are nevertheless evenly distributed over the whole field .",
    "fig.[disptot ] might suggest the existence of two peaks around the systemic velocity , caused by rotation of a subsample . as we will see , no further evidence for this",
    "furthermore , the distribution looks asymmetric in that it seems to contain a larger population of clusters on the low velocity side .",
    "this as well is marginally apparent in kissler - patig et al .",
    "( their fig.2 ) , although the authors do not mention it . to compare the low velocity part ( lower than the systemic velocity ) with the high velocity part , we mirrored both parts to produce two symmetric distributions and performed kolmogorov - smirnov tests . while the high velocities are drawn from a gaussian with 1440 km / s as systemic velocity and 308 km / s as dispersion with a probability of 0.99 , the k - s - test finds a probability of 0.63 for the low velocities using the same parameters .",
    "however , simple simulations of gaussian distributions , having the same number of objects , quickly show that a ks - test frequently gives low probabilities .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , fig.[gaussim ] shows 6 simulations with 470 objects each .",
    "the parent populations are gaussians with 1440 km / s as the  systemic  velocity and a dispersion of 300 km / s . indicated are the probabilities returned by a ks - test ( we used the command kstest/1sample under midas ) .",
    " peaks  occur frequently and one would conclude that the significance of peaks in fig.[disptot ] is doubtful as well .",
    "fig.[velorad ] plots the correlation velocities against projected radii in arcmin .",
    "the upper panel shows all clusters , while the middle panel selects those for which both correlation and line velocities are available and differ by less than 100 km / s .",
    "again , it appears as if the low velocity wing would be more extended , but also that the limit at high velocities at 2000 km / s is sharper than at low velocities .",
    "the lower panel shows those objects for which the difference between correlation and line velocities is less than 50 km / s .",
    "these are our best velocities and here a low velocity limit at about the symmetric velocity becomes visible as well .",
    "although one wants to determine the velocity dispersion with as many objects as possible , the existence of velocity limits symmetric to the systemic velocity suggests that the velocity dispersion should be determined within these limits .",
    "after we have discussed the dynamics , we will come back to this point and see that this sharp borders are about 140 km / s above the circular velocity ( 415 km / s ) .",
    "distinctly higher velocities can only be produced by objects on very elongated orbits near their pericenters and for which the radial velocity measures approximately the space velocity .",
    "these are expected to be rare , leaving more quantitative statements to a theoretical model of the system .",
    "possibilities are unbound objects and/or objects in the foreground , which will be discussed later on .    looking for further properties which may distinguish low and high velocities , we find their luminosity distribution quite different . with respect to velocities ,",
    "the cluster candidates have been selected randomly , and the distribution of magnitudes is accordingly expected to be similar and symmetric around the systemic velocity .",
    "[ velomag ] , in which the r - magnitudes are plotted versus the radial velocities , demonstrates that this is not the case .",
    "indicated by the vertical dashed lines are the systemic velocity ( middle line ) , a velocity of 2000 km / s , and the corresponding symmetric low velocity of 880 km / s . while the number of objects fainter than r=22 mag statistically agree on the high and low velocity sides , it is striking that only one object at r=21.6 mag is found with a velocity ( marginally ) higher than 2000 km / s while there are 10 objects with velocities of 880 km / s or lower with magnitudes brighter than r=22 mag .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that for both low and high velocities , we are biased towards bright objects .",
    "the suspicion may arise that some low velocity objects could belong to a population in the foreground , because such asymmetry should not be present in a spherical and more or less isotropic system .",
    "in that case , one would expect these objects not to be concentrated around ngc 1399 .",
    "unfortunately , our sample is not very suitable to search for differences in the radial distribution of subsamples , since the coordinate distribution is as much determined by the mask and slit positioning as by the true spatial distribution .",
    "selecting the objects with , say , less than 900 km / s results in 34 clusters , which must be regarded as the minimum for senseful statistical statements .",
    "we examined the radial cumulative distribution of these clusters together with a comparison sample of velocities higher than 1300 km / s and found no difference .",
    "[ redblue ] shows the velocity histograms of the red and the blue clusters .",
    "the total number now is 437 because we do not have colors for all objects .",
    "the distribution of red and blue clusters look rather different .",
    "the formal standard deviations of the velocities are 362 km / s and 289 km / s for the blue and red clusters , respectively .",
    "as will be discussed later on , this difference is attributed to their different surface density profiles . however , these values are larger than those that we will derive as velocity dispersions , pointing to the difficulty in deciding what the correct sample for the determination of the velocity dispersion is . with this sample ,",
    "which also includes the extreme velocities , we probably overestimate the true velocity dispersion by the existence of objects which may not belong to the ngc 1399 system .",
    "the detailed morphology of these histograms is somewhat dependent on the binning .",
    "however , the peak of the blue clusters near 1800 km / s is stable against varying the bin width and it is now clear that it is indeed composed of preferentially blue clusters .",
    "also the peak at 1550 km / s remains with smaller bin widths than the present 70 km / s .",
    "whether the central double peak of the red clusters is caused by rotation , will be investigated later on .",
    "the different velocity dispersions are also visible in fig.[veloradredblue ] , which shows radial distance vs. velocity for the red and the blue sample .",
    "furthermore , it appears that for distances smaller than about 3 arcmin , the velocity dispersion decreases towards the center , perhaps somewhat more distinctly for the red clusters than for the blue clusters .",
    "we will come back to this point when discussing the velocity dispersions .",
    "a fundamental kinematic question for our sample is whether we find signatures of rotation and whether these are different for different subpopulations of globular clusters .",
    "the diagnostic diagram which we have to analyse is a plot of radial velocities vs. the position angle .",
    "ct et al .",
    "@xcite give a useful discussion of the relation between the intrinsic and projected rotational velocity field of a spherical system and we do not repeat that here .",
    "if the intrinsic rotation velocity field is stratified on spheres , and the galaxy is not seen pole on , we measure radial velocities that depend sinusoidally on the azimuth angle .",
    "therefore , we fit the following relation : @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the projected radial velocity at the azimuth angle @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the systemic velocity , and a the rotation amplitude",
    ".    we select velocities between 800 km / s and 2100 km / s to omit the extreme ones .",
    "fig.[rotrev ] plots the radial velocities of three samples vs. the azimuth angle which goes from north past east .",
    "the uppermost panel is the full sample , then follow the blue and blue clusters .",
    "further selections are the outer blue clusters ( more distant than 6@xmath5 ) , the ",
    "double peak  from fig.[disptot ] for all clusters ( between 1280 and 1600 km / s ) and the same selection for the red clusters only , motivated by the right panel in fig.[redblue ] where the double peak is more prominently visible than for the blue clusters .",
    "these samples are shown in fig.[rotrot ] together with the outer blue clusters .",
    "least - squares fits for these samples return the values of a and @xmath27 as listed in table [ rot.tab ] . as the uncertainties ( the 1-sigma limits ) for the parameters show , only the blue outer clusters and the  peak  selection for the entire sample show rotation signals .",

    ", the outer blue clusters could still rotate around the major axis .",
    "however , the fact that the double peak formally shows a rotation signal according to eq.(3 ) does not necessarily mean that it is indeed caused by rotation .",
    "if this was the case then one should expect the rotation to be even more pronounced among the red clusters , where the double - peak is more prominent and symmetric with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "fig.[xyplot ] selects velocities in the intervals 1280 km / s - 1400 km / s and 1480 km / s - 1600 km / s and shows this sample in a x - y - plot ( arcmin ) .",
    "the horizontal line indicates the major axis .",
    "open hexagons are objects belonging to the lower velocity interval , open triangles to the higher interval .",
    "additionally , blue clusters are marked by crosses .",
    "this entire sample gives a rotation signal of 20@xmath28 km / s around the major axis .",
    "however , a large part of the signal comes from the concentration of blue clusters with low velocities in the south - east quadrant with only a few high velocity counterparts in the north - west quadrant .",
    "the dominance of blue clusters on the east side also causes a east - west asymmetry of the double peak . on the other hand",
    ", the red clusters do not show any rotation signal , but a pronounced double - peak .",
    "generally , rotation does not appear to be significant .    the rotation pattern , resp .",
    "its absence , seems to constitute a difference to m87 , where apparently the entire cluster system rotates ( kissler - patig & gebhardt 1998 ) . the work of ct et al .",
    "@xcite reveals an even more complicated pattern , where the red clusters rotate around the photometric minor axis , while only the outer blue clusters rotate around the minor axis and the inner blue clusters around the major axis .",
    "we refer the reader to ct et al . for the interpretation of this result .    that only the blue clusters show signs of rotation",

    "the most important observable which we want to extract from our data is the projected velocity dispersion and its dependence on radius .",
    "given the above considerations regarding the extreme velocities it is clear that neither measurement nor interpretation are completely straightforward .",
    "we employ the maximum - likelihood dispersion estimator shown by pryor & meylan @xcite .",
    "we fix the systemic velocity to 1441 km / s",
    ". then the velocity dispersion @xmath28 is calculated ( by iteration ) according to @xmath29 where the sum is taken over all velocities and where the @xmath30 denote the uncertainties of the individual velocities .",
    "the uncertainty of the resulting velocity dispersion is calculated according to the somewhat lengthy expression given by pryor & meylan .",
    "we can not be sure about possible contamination by objects not belonging to ngc 1399 .",
    "for example , a couple of objects may be associated with nearby dwarf galaxies and with ngc 1396 . moreover",
    ", foreground objects might be present .",
    "however , removing likely non - members of the ngc 1399 system would require a discussion of individual objects , which we can not give here",
    ". the global effect on the velocity dispersion will anyway be very small .",
    "this , however , is not true for the very extreme velocities around 600 km / s or 2400 km / s .",
    "fig.[dispvar ] shows the dependence of the velocity dispersion on a lower velocity cut - off ( always symmetric to the high velocity cut - off with respect to the systemic velocity ) for the total sample , the blue , and the red sample . particularly for the blue clusters , the effect is not negligible . since there is no obvious ",
    "way for defining , which objects should be considered and which should be discarded , we refer to the lower panel of fig.[velorad ] and define the upper velocity limit to be 2080 km / s and the corresponding low limit to be 800 km / s .",
    "however , we also shall show the effect of the full sample on the circular velocity and the mass profile .    we choose slightly overlapping radial bin widths of 3 arcmin , allowing reasonable statistics to be obtained even after subdividing the sample according to blue and red clusters .",
    "table [ dispersions ] lists the results .",
    "the correlation velocities were used to derive the numbers in table [ dispersions ] .",

    "the radial bins overlap to force some smoothing , so the values are not independent .",
    "the only bin which marginally deviates from a radially constant velocity dispersion is the innermost bin of the blue clusters .",

    "using the same velocity selection , the dispersion for radial bins of @xmath42@xmath5 , 2 - 2.5@xmath5 , 2.5 - 3@xmath5 are 219@xmath229 km / s , 211@xmath224 km / s , 292@xmath231km / s , respectively .",
    "using the entire sample , the corresponding values are 263@xmath234 km / s , 318@xmath234 km / s , 331@xmath235 km / s .",

    "their radial bin samples are very small and have large uncertainties , which individually overlap with our results . ignoring their innermost bin at 2 arcmin",
    ", their work also supports a constant dispersion , but at a value of 373@xmath31 km / s which we would not reach even without any selection .",
    "all differences are most likely due to their small numbers , large measurement uncertainties and also inhomogeneous data . in paper",
    "iii we show that the various sources of the velocities used by kissler - patig et al .",
    "have considerable systematic velocity shifts .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss these differences further .",
    "another point in fig.[dispdat ] is striking : the red clusters exhibit a systematically lower dispersion than the blue clusters .",
    "we shall see in more detail in the following section on dynamics that this can be explained by the difference in their spatial density profiles .",
    "our intention in obtaining this large velocity sample was to have a sufficient number of probes to derive the mass profile of ngc 1399 and the orbital structure simultaneously without having to make restrictive assumptions concerning spherical symmetry or isotropy .",
    "the most general models come from orbit - based axisymmetric analysis ( gebhardt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , these models require a significant parameter space to explore which we will consider in a subsequent paper ( gebhardt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we will first consider spherical models with different anisotropies , and discuss possible biases that this may create .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that ngc 1399 is well approximated by a spherical and more or less isotropic model .",
    "moreover , the fact that the projected velocity dispersion does not change with radial distance indicates that these properties as well do not change significantly with radial distance .",
    "a spherical model was also used by saglia et al .",
    "@xcite and kronawitter et al .",
    "@xcite which allows us to make a direct comparison .      to provide the nomenclature",
    ", we briefly introduce the spherical jeans equation .",
    "binney & tremaine @xcite showed how it can be derived from the collisionless boltzmann - equation .",
    "it reads :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the circular velocity , @xmath9 is the constant of gravitation , @xmath10 the galactocentric distance , @xmath11 the mass contained within @xmath10 , @xmath34 the radial component of the velocity dispersion , @xmath35 the density profile of clusters , and @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the tangential velocity dispersion .",
    "the azimuthal velocity dispersion @xmath38 is equal to @xmath37 in the spherical case .",
    "not all parameters are accessible from our observations , which only measure _ projected _ values .",
    "while we can determine @xmath39 from our wide - field photometry of the gcs ( paper i ) , we have no straightforward possibility to deproject @xmath40 , our observed projected velocity dispersion , because we only observed clusters out to 9 arcmin , while the wide - field photometry still finds cluster candidates at 20 arcmin distance .",
    "we assume ( as all previous workers did ) that ngc 1399 exhibits spherical symmetry .",
    "strictly , this is not true .",
    "the ellipticity of ngc 1399 ( @xmath41 ) is modest , but non - zero .",
    "it ranges from about 0.1 in the inner region and may increase to 0.2 ( caon et al .",
    "@xcite , paper i ) .",
    "if ngc 1399 deviates from our spherical assumption , the likely effect would be for us to underestimate the mass ( an oblate elliptical , supported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion , exhibits a smaller velocity dispersion than would correspond to its mass in a spherical configuration ) .",
    "as magorrian & ballantyne @xcite show , this situation is also expected to create a spurious radial bias . in the sample of 21 round elliptical galaxies of gerhard et al .",
    "@xcite , which they analyzed under the assumption of spherical symmetry , ngc 1399 has a central @xmath42 value of 10 , one of the highest occuring .",
    "it thus seems unlikely that this value for ngc 1399 is underestimated .",
    "however , gerhard et al .",
    "state that no correlation is seen between their central @xmath43-values and the anisotropy .",
    "a @xmath42-value of 10 may not be surprisingly high , but so far , old metal - rich populations like the galactic globular clusters ngc 6496 and ngc 6352 do not show the steep mass functions which are needed to produce such a value .",
    "evaporation of low mass stars also is no likely explanation ( pulone et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have seen that the red and the blue clusters have different velocity dispersions .",
    "they must trace the same mass . if we set @xmath44 , i.e. adopting a radially constant @xmath45 we have    @xmath46    the ( deprojected ) density slopes are @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the red and the blue clusters , respectively ( paper i ) .",
    "for the red clusters , these numbers are valid for a larger radial range than we are considering here , while the blue clusters assume the slope of the red clusters for r@xmath38@xmath5 .",
    "we see from the above equation that if @xmath49 would be zero for both populations , the difference in the velocity dispersion accounts for the different radial density profiles : the equation predicts @xmath50 , while the observed value is 0.88 .",
    "we can not deproject the velocity dispersions with our still noisy data and our incomplete coverage of the cluster system .",
    "as paper i shows , the cluster system extends to at least 100 kpc in radius ( recall that the most distant milky way globular clusters are beyond 100 kpc ) .",
    "but we could get a feeling about projection effects by projecting a model cluster system with different anisotropies and requiring it to give a constant projected velocity dispersion .",
    "doing so , we assume a cluster system with red and blue clusters , which has density profiles with power law exponents -2.64 and -1.8 , respectively .",
    "the following projection formula is used :    @xmath51    where @xmath40 and @xmath34 are the projected and radial velocity dispersions , respectively , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 the density profiles in the same sense .",
    "now we adopt @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a core radius , small compared with the inner limit of 10 kpc , so that a pure power - law density profile is achieved already at this radius .",
    "@xmath56 is an exponent which takes the above values for red and blue clusters , respectively .",
    "we also adopt an outer cut - off radius , @xmath57 , which is set to 100 kpc , corresponding to 18 arcmin .",
    "this choice is arbitrary and assumes that clusters outside this radius , if they exist , do not significantly influence the projection effects .",
    "we then assume for the two values of @xmath56 different , but radially constant values for the anisotropy in order to avoid a further extension of parameter space .",
    "@xmath34 is assumed to vary linearly between 10 kpc and the cut - off radius , i.e. @xmath58 . for the isotropic case , @xmath34 is radially constant .",
    "now we ask : for each value of the anisotropy , what radial dependence is required for @xmath34 to produce _ constant projected velocity dispersions of 291 km / s for the blue clusters and 255 km / s for the red clusters _ ?",
    "after having found ( by trial and error ) those values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 which in projection give constant velocity dispersions within a few km / s , we then can calculate the circular velocities according to the jeans equation .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig.[dispproj ] .",
    "the upper panel refers to the red clusters , the lower panel to the blue clusters .",
    "the different values for @xmath49 are indicated at the right hand side ( @xmath49 = 0.8 has been skipped for the blue clusters ) .",
    "we overplot the circular velocity resulting from the luminous component alone .",
    "table [ coeffs ] lists the corresponding values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we assume isotropy for the red clusters , we get a constant circular velocity of 415 km / s .",
    "to construct a mass model for the inner region of ngc 1399 , we need the ( deprojected ) luminosity density profile and the assignment of a @xmath43-value .",
    "neither of which can be achieved in a straightforward manner .    for the luminosity density profile",
    "we adopt the r - profile given in paper i. since the surface brightness profile itself is a composition of different observations done in different photometric bands , one has to adopt shifts depending on the color of ngc 1399 ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "our adopted r luminosity density profile ( kron - cousins ) is equation ( 2 ) , which corresponds to a distance of 19 mpc .",
    "saglia et al .",
    "@xcite quote from their dynamical modelling a @xmath42-value of 10 . to convert this into a @xmath61-value",
    ", one has to know the b - r colors of ngc 1399 and the sun ( cousins - system ) .",
    "b - r colors ( in various apertures ) are given by poulain @xcite ( 1.56 ) , sandage & visvanathan @xcite ( 1.47 ) , mackie et al . @xcite ( 1.4 ) , lauberts @xcite ( 1.62 ) .",
    "we adopt a value of 1.55 , omitting mackie et al.s measurement .",
    "regarding the sun we use the theoretical b - r color for the appropriate effective temperature of solar - like stars of houdashelt et al .",
    "@xcite and adopt @xmath62 .",
    "this gives a factor of 0.59 , by which @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "in the following , we use @xmath61=5.5 , taking into account the different adopted distances .    also overplotted are the total circular velocities resulting from the sum of the luminous potential and the best fitting dark halo model ( which we describe below ) .",
    "the main effect of varying @xmath49 for the clusters is that in the case of a radial anisotropy ( @xmath63 ) , little mass is needed to produce the required constant projected velocity dispersion , while more mass is needed when the anisotropy changes to tangential ( @xmath64 ) . that this effect is larger for the blue clusters than for the red clusters",
    "is a result of their shallower density profile ( the density profile and @xmath49 are additive in the jeans equation ) .",
    "we note that in reality the effect of @xmath49 on the blue clusters might be slightly less than indicated in the figure .",
    "the reason is that the density profile of the blue clusters becomes steeper and undistinguishable from that of the red clusters ( paper i ) beyond 50 kpc of projected radial distance , while for this calculation we extrapolated the shallower profile of the inner region out to the cut - off radius .",
    "the uncertainties of the derived circular velocities are difficult to formalize .",
    "apart from the dominant systematic effect of the application of velocity limits , they depend on the distance , on the uncertainty of the surface density profiles , on the assumption that @xmath49 really is constant for the entire cluster system and varies in the adopted manner .",
    "it is easier to follow the propagation of the observational uncertainty , represented by the uncertainty of the projected velocity dispersion . to give a number , an uncertainty of 15 km / s translates roughly into 30 km / s in the circular velocity .",
    "it is then interesting to note that for the red clusters the degeneracy between mass profile and orbital structure is not more important for the derivation of the mass profile than are the observational uncertainties . in other words : a population with a steep density profile is sensitive to mass , a population with a shallow density profile is sensitive to the orbit structure .",
    "the above mentioned relation between the @xmath49-values for the two populations is also visible in fig.[dispproj ] . for isotropy ,",
    "the blue clusters give , within the uncertainties , the same circular velocity as do the red clusters .",
    "the slightly stronger tangential behaviour of the blue clusters is not really significant .",
    "if the blue clusters were more tangential then also the circular velocities for @xmath65 would be displaced to higher values .",
    "so the different circular velocities for assumed isotropy measure the difference of the @xmath49-values .",
    "we therefore can say with some confidence that both populations are close to isotropic .",
    "how does the analysis of the globular cluster system compare with the analysis of the inner stellar body of ngc 1399 ?",
    "as did saglia et al .",
    "@xcite , we use for the dark halo a logarithmic potential of the form    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the asymptotic circular velocity and @xmath68 the halo core radius .",
    "because of @xmath69 , we have @xmath70    to represent the dark halo by a logarithmic potential , we choose the circular velocities derived from the red clusters because of their lower sensitivity to @xmath49 and assume isotropy .",
    "then we subtract the luminous component from the total mass and get the circular velocity curve for the dark halo alone at the four radii between 10 kpc and 40 kpc given by fig.[dispdat ] .",
    "a least - square fit is used to obtain @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we get @xmath71 km / s and @xmath72 kpc .",
    "the fit uncertainties are small and do not reflect the true systematic uncertainties , which are difficult to parametrize .",
    "but they do account for the observational uncertainty of the projected velocity dispersion .",
    "systematic uncertainties lie in the adoption of m / l and the determination of the circular velocity . small variations of m / l ( @xmath73 ) do not change @xmath67 within the above uncertainties , but have a stronger effect on @xmath68 : one gets @xmath74 .",
    "variations of the circular velocity change @xmath67 approximately by the same amount and let @xmath68 vary as @xmath75 .    the `` best fitting model '' of saglia et al .",
    "@xcite has @xmath76 ( 19.3 kpc ) and @xmath77 km / s as the dark halo parameters . for other models , which also fit well the saglia et al .",
    "data and even better to our circular velocities , no dark halo parameters are quoted .",
    "kronawitter et al .",
    "@xcite use the same data as saglia et al . , but different models and a different distance ( 21.9 mpc ) .",
    "they do not list their model parameters , but give the range of acceptable circular velocities at the last data point .",
    "these models seem to fit well , although the range still is appreciable .",
    "we note that the  best  @xmath42 of kronawitter et al . is 10.6 , i.e. larger than that of saglia et al.s in spite of the larger distance which would one let expect a proportionally smaller @xmath42 .",
    "if we use this interval as reference and find those halo parameters of logarithmic potentials which span the acceptable range , we get the following :    model 1 ( high ) : @xmath67 = 390 km / s , @xmath68 = 7.7 kpc + model 2 ( best ) : @xmath67 = 370 km / s , @xmath68 = 10.5 kpc + model 3 ( low ) : @xmath67 = 350 km / s , @xmath68 = 19.2 kpc + these dark matter models , to which we added our luminous component ( @xmath78 ) , are plotted in fig.[dispproj2 ] ( dashed lines ) together with our best model ( solid line ) and that of saglia et al .",
    "( dotted line ) .",
    "the latter one is slightly radial .",
    "the saglia et al .- model which is almost isotropic within our radial range , has a circular velocity of 404 km / s at 8.9 kpc .",
    "it is encouraging to see how well the results agree in spite of the completely different analyses .",
    "had we renounced any velocity selection , the agreement would be worse .",
    "the unselected samples of blue and red clusters have velocity dispersions of 350@xmath7914 km / s and 287@xmath7915 km / s , respectively .",
    "these values result ( for isotropy ) in a constant circular velocity of 465 km / s .",
    "a fit of a logarithmic potential gives @xmath67=412 km / s and @xmath68=9 kpc .",
    "the dashed - dotted line in fig.[dispproj2 ] shows this model .",
    "there is no hard evidence to reject it , but the difference to the stellar models is considerable .",
    "moreover , the increase of the circular velocity between 5 kpc and 20 kpc is more pronounced than in the other models . in order to have a constant projected velocity dispersion",
    ", the anisotropies of the blue and red clusters must therefore conspire .",
    "but again , the present data does not allow a firm exclusion .",
    "as mentioned before , there have been already some attempts to investigate the kinematics of the ngc 1399 gcs .",
    "the most recent work is that of kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite , who compiled the radial velocities of 74 gcs . a comparison of their velocities in common with ours can be found in paper iii .",
    "the main finding of kissler - patig et al .",
    "is that the dispersion increases from about 260 km / s at 2@xmath5 to almost 400 km / s at 8@xmath5 of radial distance .",
    "the similarity of the outer velocity dispersion with that of fornax galaxies leads them to conclude that the outer clusters might be moving in the overall fornax potential rather than in the potential of ngc 1399 . however , the uncertainties in the velocity dispersion , caused by the low number of objects and relatively large velocity uncertainties , are so large that even a constant velocity dispersion of the order 300 km / s is covered by almost all of their error bars .",
    "kissler - patig et al .",
    "note a marked turn - up in the dispersion between the stellar component and the clusters .",
    "we rather say that this depends on what cluster population is considered and also what source for the stellar velocities is used .",
    "kissler - patig et al .",
    "use older data by franx et al .",
    "@xcite , bicknell et al .",
    "@xcite , and winsall & freeman @xcite . the more recent study by saglia et al .",
    "@xcite finds about 250 km / s as the average of their outermost point which is in excellent agreement with the red clusters , as one would expect , because this population best represents the stellar component both in terms of color and radial profile , whose power - law exponent is -1.8 ( see paper i ) .",
    "the statement that the clusters are moving in the general fornax potential can have a dubious meaning .",
    "the equality of the velocity dispersions of gcs and galaxies , however , does not say much about the dynamical relationship of these components .",
    "for example , drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite give the quite different values of @xmath80 km / s and @xmath81 km / s as the velocity dispersions for giant and dwarf fornax galaxies , respectively ( they interpret this as the difference between virialization of the giants and infall of the dwarfs ) .",
    "of course , we assume that the majority of the clusters we observed are bound to ngc 1399 .",
    "but we do not know how far the dark halo extends and we can not exclude that ngc 1399 is located at the bottom of a `` cd dark halo '' which is the central substructure in a cluster - wide dark halo ( ghinga et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", the halo of ngc 1399 would be part of the cluster potential , but finding evidence for this is beyond the present observational possibilities .    turning to planetary nebulae , napolitano et al .",
    "@xcite re - analyzed older velocity data by arnaboldi et al .",
    "@xcite . in their sample of 37 pne",
    ", they see evidence for a disturbed velocity structure and assign this to a possible past encounter with ngc 1404 .",
    "we can not comment on that apart from saying that we do not see it , but it would be very interesting to have a larger sample of pne to prove or disprove it .",
    "ngc 1399 has been sometimes labelled as the central cd galaxy in the fornax cluster , expressing the fact that its surface luminosity falls off slower than a de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the derived total mass profile resembles that of an isothermal sphere : its total density falls off like @xmath82 .",
    "its luminous surface density in the r band falls off like @xmath83 ( paper i ) which is consistent with a deprojected mass profile describable by a uniform power law with an exponent of @xmath84 , if the color gradient is taken into account .",
    "no feature , which would indicate the onset of a  cd - halo  is discernible . as jaffe @xcite and white @xcite already have argued , a @xmath85 profile in the outer regions of elliptical galaxies emerges , if stellar orbits are scattered near the escape energy in the presence of a nearly keplerian potential . in projection , this behaviour well resembles a de vaucouleurs profile . in the case of ngc 1399",
    ", we have an isothermal sphere out to about 4 effective radii , and since the @xmath86 profile of ngc 1399 is realized out to at least 10 effective radii , one may conjecture that also the isothermal sphere extends to this galactocentric distance .",
    "under this view , ngc 1399 would be distinguished from `` normal elliptical galaxies '' with a de vaucouleurs profile by the fact that due to the huge dark halo , the keplerian regime sets in at much larger distances than we are able to investigate and most stars have energies much lower than the escape energy .",
    "we note that only a @xmath86 profile brings in agreement the velocity dispersions derived from the jeans equation and from the virial theorem ( see van den bosch @xcite for remarks on that matter ) in case of an isotropic tracer population in an isothermal sphere",
    ". it would be very interesting to also investigate the nearby central galaxies like m87 and ngc 3311 , but accurate wide - field photometry is not yet available for them .",
    "the question arises whether the dark halo of ngc 1399 could be identified with a dark halo predicted from cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations .",
    "such simulations make specific predictions regarding the structural properties , especially the density profile , of dark halos .",
    "however , in the context of galaxy formation one expects a cdm halo not to maintain its structure , but to be modified according to the dynamical details of the formation history .",
    "therefore our intention is not to prove or disprove cdm predictions , but to morphologically describe the dark halo in terms of parameters used in cdm simulations .",
    "we adopt the density profile as    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is a characteristic density and @xmath89 a characteristic radius .",

    "it is also noteworthy that no corresponding feature is visible in the stellar luminous profile .",

    "a comparison of fig.[massprof ] and fig.[dispproj ] leads to the conclusion that the global orbit distribution of the clusters should be close to isotropic as has been found also in the cases of m87 ( ct et al.@xcite ) and m49 ( ct et al.@xcite ) . we can not really constrain the anisotropy of the red clusters , but the blue clusters trace the same mass , which narrows down the permitted range of anisotropies . even without a detailed analysis of the higher orders of the velocity distribution ,",
    "a look at fig.[redblue ] suggests that the blue clusters are more tangential than the red clusters , certainly not the opposite . a true circular velocity of , say , 450 km / s instead of 415 km / s would fit even better at least to the rosat x - ray mass , but according to fig.[dispproj ] would cause the red clusters to gain a higher tangential bias than the blue clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "lowering the circular velocity would leave the blue clusters more tangential , but enhances the difference to the x - ray mass .",
    "it is interesting to extrapolate the mass profiles of the nfw halo and the logarithmic potential towards larger galactocentric distances in order to see how they would fit into the cluster mass profile .",
    "fig.[masslarge ] shows the mass profiles out to 500 kpc .",
    "the numbers 1,2,3 label the rosat mass profile , the mass profile of the fornax cluster derived from galaxy velocities ( drinkwater et al .",

    "labels 4 and 5 mark the logarithmic potential and the nfw halo .",
    "the latter two halos are hardly distinguishable out to 200 kpc .",
    "a comparison with the fornax cluster mass profile reveals that neither the logarithmic potential nor the nfw halo can be the dominant component of this mass , which at 500 kpc is ( 3@xmath21@xmath132 .",
    "more than 40 galaxies , roughly half of drinkwater et al.s sample , are projected within this radius .",
    "according to drinkwater et al .",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath133 ( b - band ) . even to achieve only marginal agreement one would need for these galaxies an average @xmath42 of 100 in case of the nfw halo and 50 in case of the logarithmic potential .",
    "these are lower limits considering that the true number of galaxies within 500 kpc is less than the projected number .",
    "the asca and rosat profiles ( disregarding their mutual disagreement in shape ) agree with drinkwater et al.s analysis .",
    "any nfw halo which could account for the mass of this analysis , is not consistent with the halo near ngc 1399 .",
    "several reasons for this discrepancy are thinkable : the dark halo of ngc 1399 is not of the nfw type or it is only a substructure within the global fornax potential , or the mass profiles are still not correct .",
    "the radial range 50kpc@xmath4r@xmath4100kpc seems to be sensitive for disciminating between the two x - ray profiles .",
    "again , the analysis of globular cluster velocities at larger radii will be of high interest .",
    "as already mentioned , one can suspect a few clusters to be members of dwarf galaxies close to ngc 1399 .",
    "interestingly , two of the objects with velocities higher than 2000 km / s seem to belong to fccb 1241 ( ferguson @xcite ) , which ferguson lists as a possible member of the fornax cluster .",
    "but also general considerations regarding the extreme velocities leads one to suspect that not all objects are members of the ngc 1399 system .",
    "radial velocities below 800 km / s or higher than 2080 km / s , which we observe out to 40 kpc galactocentric radii , mean velocities higher than 640 km / s relative to ngc 1399 .",
    "these velocities must belong to objects near their perigalactocentric distances .",
    "let us assume that they are exactly at their pericenters and that we observe their space velocities ( which by itself seems to be very unlikely ) .",
    "then with the knowledge of the potential we can ask what minimal apogalactocentric distances these objects must have .",
    "doing so we approximate the sum of luminous and dark matter by a logarithmic potential and find that the parameters @xmath134 km / s and @xmath135 kpc are a reasonable representation .",
    "moreover , we assume that this potential can be extrapolated to large radii out to , say , 400 kpc .",
    "considering only bound orbits , conservation of energy and angular momentum gives the apocentric and pericentric velocities and radii @xmath136,@xmath137,@xmath138,@xmath139 .",
    "if @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the respective values of the potential , angular momentum conservation reads @xmath142 and energy conservation @xmath143 .",
    "this gives @xmath144 and    @xmath145    for a logarithmic potential    @xmath146    for the above values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , fig.[orbits ] plots perigalactic velocities vs. pericentric distances for five indicated apocentric distances in kpc .",
    "overplotted are all objects with radial velocities lower than 800 km / s , interpreting their projected distances as pericentric distances and their radial velocities relative to ngc 1399 as pericentric velocities .",
    "these are the minimal pericentric velocities and the minimal apocentric distances .",
    "one concludes that the radius of the cluster system was at least 200 kpc , if indeed all clusters were bound to ngc 1399 .",
    "some of them are very faint and we have no independent confirmation by line velocities , so doubts may remain .",
    "but then also remains the question why there are not so many at the corresponding high radial velocities .",
    "can they belong to ngc 1399 ?",
    "relative velocities up to 200 km / s larger than the circular velocity can be easily produced by orbits with apocentric distances up to 50 kpc .",
    "but for the plotted objects , one needs distances of 200 kpc and more .",
    "if by some strange coincidence we would pick up 7 - 8 clusters with apocentric distances of 200 kpc , why then only 4 - 5 with distances of 100 kpc and not , say , 50 , considering the radial power - law number density profile of clusters ?    can the objects with the highest relative , i.e. lowest , radial velocities be stars ? the details of that discussion must be postponed , but an example can be given . the object 86:105 ( in the notation of paper iii )",
    "has a radial velocity of 570 km / s , an r - magnitude of 20.8 and a color of c - r=1.2 . the most favourable case , i.e. the nearest possible distance requires an extremely metal - poor main sequence star with an absolute magnitude of @xmath147 , corresponding to a distance of about 9 kpc .",
    "the distance to the galactic center then is roughly 12 kpc .",
    "the vector of galactic rotation towards the fornax cluster has the value -120 km / s .",
    "we thus would have a star at 12 kpc galactocentric distance with a radial velocity of + 420 km / s in the galactic standard of rest and would face a similar problem as before .",
    "given all this , we therefore call attention to the possibility that some of the objects with radial velocities lower than 800 km / s are objects in the foreground at an unknown distance and that their velocities have to be interpreted as recession rather than peculiar velocities .    the existence of a very diluted stellar population between the local group and the fornax cluster would be an extremely interesting matter for a number of obvious reasons .",
    "hst observations could perhaps resolve nearby objects into stars .",
    "the above cited example should have a distance of only a few mpc .",
    "if all this was true , one would expect a comparable number per area of low velocity objects at radii larger than 10 arcmin away from ngc 1399 , again a strong motivation to observe a distant cluster sample .",
    "another possibility is that some objects with extreme velocities are not bound to ngc 1399 . within a projected radius of 400 kpc ,",
    "there are more than 20 neighboring galaxies , making it plausible that an object coming from so far is not necessarily bound .",
    "but then one should expect that there are many more unbound objects with low inclined orbits .",
    "of course , the mass profile of ngc 1399 has to be derived under the assumption that indeed all clusters belong to ngc 1399 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the pure existence of high velocities relative to ngc 1399 requires the existence of dark matter .      in combination with the wide - field washington study of dirsch et al .",
    "( paper i ) we presently have the largest data set available for a gcs of a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "although , as we have seen , such a large sample produces a lot of new questions , can we formulate constraints for gcss formation scenarios currently discussed in the literature ?",
    "a compact summary of model predictions is given by rhode & zepf @xcite .",
    "they distinguish four different models : the  monolithic collapse  scenario ( e.g. larson @xcite , arimoto & yoshii @xcite ) , the merger model put forward by ashman & zepf @xcite , and the models by forbes et al .",
    "@xcite , and ct et al .",
    "the forbes et al .",
    "model let both metal - rich and metal - poor clusters form during a dissipational collapse and involves the capture of additional gcs by tidal effects from neighbouring galaxies or the accretion of dwarf galaxies .",
    "ct et al.s model suggests that only the metal - rich clusters have formed in a dissipational collapse , while the metal - poor clusters have been assembled hierarchically by dissipationless mergers . rather than to underline the merits of the above suggestions ( they are found in the respective papers ) we want to point to a few problems which may arise when interpreting the properties of the ngc 1399 gcs in the context of any of these scenarios .",
    "the global orbital distribution of the clusters is close to isotropic .",
    "this requires some kind of relaxation mechanism which works out to large radii .",
    "it is not plausible that a monolithic collapse model ( which otherwise has been successfully applied to explain many properties of elliptical galaxies , e.g. chiosi & carraro @xcite and references therein ) , can provide such a mechanism .",
    "moreover , in this model , one would expect rotation to be more pronounced in the inner regions , while there is only a weak signal for the outer blue clusters . a further argument from the photometric work",
    "is that the local specific frequency of the clusters is increasing outwards . on the other hand",
    ", there is evidence that it depends on the star formation rate ( see the remarks below ) .",
    "therefore , if the star formation rate increases inwards according to the gas density profile , one expects to see the cluster formation efficiency increasing inwards as well ( larsen & richtler @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this should not result in an outwards increasing local specific frequency , as is the case in ngc 1399 ( paper i ) , unless cluster destruction processes significantly shaped the cluster number density profile in our radial range .",
    "this , however , is unlikely .",
    "one then would expect an increasing tangential bias for both red and blue clusters , for which there is no evidence .",
    "we note that the remark on the uncertain anisotropy also applies to the analysis of ct et al .",
    "@xcite of the m87 cluster system .",
    "they find the red clusters to have @xmath148 and the blue ones to have @xmath149 , when they impose the mass profile taken from x - ray analyses .",
    "while the red clusters probably always stay more radial , both the absolute values and the difference are uncertain and may change strongly when the mass profile is changed only moderately .",
    "a similar approach in the case of ngc 1399 would have to face the contradicting mass profiles and therefore is prohibited , unless there is better agreement .",
    "can the blue clusters be accreted as in the scenario of ct et al .",
    "@xcite ? invented primarily to explain the phenomenon of bimodality , we note that one of its predictions , namely the high specific frequency of central galaxies , is questioned by the fact that ngc 1399 is probably more ",
    "normal  regarding its specific frequency than previously thought ( paper i , ostrov et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , ct et al . refer to m87 , where a wide - field study still has to come .",
    "furthermore , ct et al . do not expect to find a bimodal gc color distribution in dwarf ellipticals , while there is now the example of ngc 1427 , a low luminosity elliptical with bimodality ( forte et al .",
    "they also cite the near equality of the velocity dispersion of outer globular clusters with fornax galaxies found by kissler - patig et al .",
    "@xcite as evidence for the blue clusters to be tidal debris .",
    "our velocity dispersions are indeed similar to that of the fornax giant ellipticals , but distinctly lower than those of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "drinkwater et al .",
    "@xcite quote @xmath80 km / s for giants and @xmath81 km / s for dwarfs .",
    "globular clusters can not be accreted individually , for example from a free - floating intergalactic population , because neither dynamical friction nor tidal interaction with the accreting host are sufficient for those compact and low - mass objects to create a strongly bound population .",
    "they have to be brought in , as in the scenario of ct et al .",
    ", as members of the cluster system of an infalling galaxy .",
    "the question is whether the above processes are able to produce an isotropic or slightly tangential orbit distribution of gcs at galactocentric radii between 10 and 40 kpc .",
    "trustworthy answers must rely on n - body simulations .",
    "what we qualitatively can take from such simulations ( e.g. van den bosch @xcite ) is that infalling satellites of sufficient mass on circular orbits spiral inwards on a time scale of about a few gyr .",
    "but such satellites ( model 6 of van den bosch et al . has a mass of @xmath150 ) are not tidally destroyed until they reach small perigalactic distances , so they should still be visible .",
    "tidal disruption occurs effectively on strongly elongated orbits ( seguin & dupraz @xcite ) , where circularization of the orbits can occur ( tormen et al .",
    "however , clusters tidally released from those satellites and now found again at large galactocentric distances , must have been released at a very early stage in order to maintain their highly eccentric orbits . in total",
    "one would expect a radial bias and not isotropy or even a tangential bias .",
    "moreover , one would not expect to see any rotation , as possibly seen for the outer blue clusters .",
    "it thus seems improbable that a large fraction of the blue clusters have been accreted through the infall of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a kinematic study of the clusters at larger galactocentric radii may turn out to be more discriminative between the collapse , infall or merger scenarios .",
    "if the rotation of the outer blue clusters is confirmed , an infall scenario becomes less probable , while rotation can be understood as a relic of a major merger event , as in the case of m87 ( kissler - patig & gebhardt @xcite , ct et al .",
    "we obtained radial velocities for 468 globular clusters of the globular cluster system of ngc 1399 , the central galaxy in the fornax cluster .",
    "the clusters have projected radial distances between 2@xmath5 and 9@xmath5 , corresponding to 11 and 50 kpc .",
    "the main results emerging from this study are :    we do not find any signature of rotation except for the outer metal - poor clusters , where a marginal rotation amplitude might be present .",
    "the velocity distribution of the clusters is not easy to interprete . particularly under error selection",
    ", one finds an asymmetry with respect to the systemic velocity ( 1441 km / s ) .",
    "there are more objects with extreme low velocities down to 600 km / s than at the high velocity wing .",
    "a strong error selection produces velocity limits at radial velocities symmetric to the systemic velocity , suggesting that there are indeed only very few objects with velocities larger than 2080 km / s or lower than 800 km / s .",
    "we suggest that a foreground population of sources may contaminate the low velocity sample .",
    "another possibility is that they are not bound to ngc 1399 .",
    "when omitting the extreme velocities , the projected velocity dispersion of the sample is 274@xmath29 km / s .",
    "it remains radially constant within the uncertainties .",
    "for the non - selected sample , it rises to 325@xmath211 km / s , as well radially constant .",
    "this constancy stands in contrast to earlier investigations with smaller samples , which found a strong radial increase of the velocity dispersion .    dividing our sample into red ( metal - rich ) and blue ( metal - poor ) clusters , we find for the red clusters a velocity dispersion of 255@xmath213 and for the blue clusters 291@xmath214 , both radially constant .",
    "this difference is in agreement with the assumption of isotropic orbits and the observed surface density distributions .",
    "we adopted a spherical dynamical model on the basis of the radial jeans - equation , and tried to constrain @xmath34 , the radial component of the velocity dispersion . by projecting a model globular cluster system",
    ", we obtained circular velocity curves , which depend on the anisotropy , which we can not determine directly .",
    "however , for the red clusters the anisotropy does not influence the circular velocity much . adopting isotropy , we derive a radially constant circular velocity of 415@xmath230 km / s .",
    "if a @xmath61 value of 5.5 for the stellar component is adopted , the dark matter component is well described by a logarithmic potential with the parameters @xmath71 km / s and @xmath72 kpc ( the small error bars tell us that the shape of a logarithmic potential is a very good representation .",
    "the dominant uncertainty still is the observed velocity dispersion . ) within our radial range , this potential is indistinguishable from a cdm halo of the nfw type with a virial mass of @xmath151 and a concentration parameter @xmath119=15 ( using the definitions of bullock et al .",
    "observations of other central galaxies revealed much shallower density profiles .",
    "our mass profile disagrees with the x - ray analysis of paolillo et al .",
    "@xcite , which results in a mass profile increasing with @xmath152 instead of increasing linearly .",
    "one might suspect that the irregular shape of the x - ray halo is somehow related to this disagreement .",
    "it also can not , although less certain , duplicate the mass profile of ikebe et al .",
    "@xcite , which predicts the opposite , namely a shallower profile .",
    "although our sample of radial velocities is the largest so far obtained for any elliptical galaxy , important questions remain : is there really an asymmetry regarding the extreme velocities or would it disappear in a larger sample ?",
    "is there rotation ?",
    "out to what radius can the constant circular velocity be followed ?",

    "<S> we study the kinematics and dynamics of the globular cluster system of ngc 1399 , the central galaxy of the fornax cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the observational data consists of medium resolution spectra , obtained at the very large telescope with fors2 and the mask exchange unit ( mxu ) . </S>",
    "<S> our sample comprises 468 radial velocities in the magnitude range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest sample of globular cluster velocities around any galaxy obtained so far . </S>",
    "<S> typical velocity uncertainties are 50 km / s , significantly improving on earlier samples . </S>",
    "<S> the radial range is @xmath1 , corresponding to 11 kpc to 50 kpc of galactocentric distance .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the velocity distribution of the sample is compatible with being a gaussian distribution . however , under moderate error selection , a slight asymmetry is visible between high and low radial velocities . </S>",
    "<S> we find bright clusters with radial velocities below 800 km / s , while they are not found at the corresponding high velocity side above 2000 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> there is the possibility that unbound clusters and/or objects in the foreground contaminate the ngc 1399 cluster sample . under strong error selection , </S>",
    "<S> practically no objects are found with velocities lower than 800 km / s or higher than 2000 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> since the extreme velocities influence the velocity dispersion considerably , uncertainty regarding the exact value of the dispersion remains . with the above velocity limits , we derive a projected velocity dispersion for the total sample of 274@xmath29 km / s which within the uncertainties remains constant over the entire radial range . without any velocity restriction </S>",
    "<S> , it increases to 325 km / s .    guided by the bimodal color distribution of clusters , we distinguish between red clusters ( c - r @xmath31.6 ) and blue clusters ( c - r @xmath41.6 ) , and find velocity dispersions for these groups of 255 @xmath213 km / s and 291@xmath214 km / s , respectively , again radially constant .    </S>",
    "<S> any possible rotation of either of these cluster populations is below the detection limit with the exception of a weak signature of rotation for the blue clusters more distant than 6@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> spherical models point to a circular velocity of @xmath6 km / s , assuming isotropy for the red clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this value is constant out to 40 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred dark halo potential can be well represented by a logarithmic potential . </S>",
    "<S> also a halo of the nfw type fits well to the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital structure of the clusters can only be weakly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent with isotropy for the red clusters and a slight tangential bias for the blue clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> some mass profiles derived from x - ray analyses do not agree with a constant circular velocity within our radial range , irrespective of its exact value . interpreting the extreme low radial velocities as space velocities of bound clusters near their pericentric distances would require an extension of the cluster system of at least 200 kpc .    </S>",
    "<S> implications for formation scenarios of the cluster system are briefly commented on . </S>"
