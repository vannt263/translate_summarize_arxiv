    "while quantum - critical paramagnons reorganize the ground state of hotspot quasiparticles into the pseudogap state , the critical superconducting fluctuations play a very similar role at the antinodes and trigger in analogy a transition to another phase .",
    "this repeated triggering of orders thus constitutes a _ cascade _ of phase transitions .",
    "the order parameter formed at the antinodes is pure particle - hole pairing .",
    "it can not be a form of superconductivity because it has to be `` orthogonal '' to the superconducting fluctuations that mediate the effective interaction .",

    "thus , the charge density is modulated with the wave vectors @xmath217 and @xmath218 connecting two opposite antinodal points .",
    "this contrasts the modulations of the quadrupole - density  @xmath219 generated@xcite at the hotspots in the presence of qdw , @xmath220 qdw wave vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are turned by @xmath64 and longer than the cdw wave vectors by a factor roughly given by @xmath221 . both orders form checkerboards as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig02](c ) shows the type of particle - hole order , i.e. whether qdw or cdw , as a qualitative function of the position on the fermi surface .",
    "whereas within our model hotspot and antinodal regions are separated , we expect in realistic systems regions of small overlap of the two orders in between .",
    ", and upon lowering the temperature , the systems develops first at  @xmath6 the instability toward the fluctuating pseudogap state ( pg ) characterized by the order parameter of eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) . at lower temperatures  @xmath222 ,",
    "strong superconducting fluctuations induce a transition toward charge density wave ( cdw ) formed at the antinodes .",
    "finally , below  @xmath1 , the particle - particle suborder of the pseudogap prevails due to curvature effects and establishes @xmath3-wave superconductivity . ]",
    "we now address the phase diagram of cuprates in the proximity of the antiferromagnetic qcp .",
    "we emphasize that our theory applies only to the `` metallic '' side of the antiferromagnet ",
    "normal metal phase transition .",
    "the regions of too low doping are thus excluded in the following discussion . in the region of intermediate doping ,",
    "suppression of carrier density below a crossover temperature  @xmath6 observed in nmr measurements @xcite was the first evidence for the existence of a `` pseudogap '' in the electron spectrum .",
    "in contrast , @xmath3-wave superconductivity appears only below a considerably lower temperature  @xmath0 . in our theory , @xmath6 is associated with the crossover to the strongly fluctuating @xmath33-symmetric composite order ( superconductivity and qdw ) close to the hotspots .",
    "@xcite the phase diagram , see fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] , is further enriched by the formation of cdw order with wave vectors @xmath223 ( fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "also the emergence of the cdw order is ultimately due to the proximity to the qcp .",
    "the additional phase transition is expected to occur at a temperature  @xmath224 inside the pseudogap phase , @xmath58 .",
    "the charge modulation observed in various recent experiments @xcite has been attributed @xcite to the existence of qdw ( or `` bond order '' ) correlations .",
    "this picture is , in principle , in agreement with nmr results @xcite and sound propagation measurements @xcite .",
    "however , stm studies @xcite of bscco and experiments with hard @xcite and resonant soft @xcite x - ray scattering on ybco have revealed a charge modulation along the bonds of the cu lattice with modulation vectors close to @xmath223 , which are the cdw wave vectors .",
    "moreover , qdw has a vanishing fourier transform near even bragg peaks .",
    "therefore , stm and hard x - ray experiments can hardly be expected to detect the qdw modulation .",
    "the seeming contradiction is resolved when we include the cdw , eq .",
    "( [ c02 ] ) , in the cu lattice .",
    "then , this explains the experimental results @xcite .",
    "cdw appears below a critical temperature  @xmath224 that can be considerably lower than @xmath6 , in line with the results of the hard x - ray experiment of ref .  .",
    "in addition , hall effect measurements @xcite indicate a reconstruction of the fermi surface that is attributed to the formation of cdw .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath224 of these two experiments agree with each other .",
    "evidence for a transition below  @xmath6 and related to cdw has also been found recently in a raman scattering study .",
    "@xcite the dual effect of the two modulations ( qdw and cdw ) on the two species of atoms in the cuo plane is a characteristic of our theory and might be tested via resonant soft x - ray scattering .",
    "very recent stm and resonant elastic x - ray experiments @xcite on bscco confirm the cdw wave vectors orientation along the bonds but indicate that they connect hotspots rather than antinodes . in our model , we expect cdw to set in at wave vectors as soon as the qdw gap is small . in realistic systems",
    ", this may indeed happen already not very far from the hotspots , possibly enhanced by reconstruction of the fermi surface . details behind this physics are clearly beyond the range of our `` minimal model '' and left for a separate study .",
    "the emergence of various gaps in @xmath225-space around the fermi surface has been reported in raman scattering on bi-2212 and hg-1201 compounds .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that in overdoped samples the superconducting gap spreads all over the fermi surface .",
    "in contrast , in underdoped samples the coherent cooper pairs are observed mostly near the nodes , whereas the gap at the antinodes is mainly of a non - superconducting origin .",
    "this effect can naturally be explained within our picture because the hotspots move to nodes with decreasing the doping and the superconducting gap at the antinodes should decrease . at the same time , the cdw gap grows at the antinodes thus pushing away \" the cooper pairs .",
    "we note that after our work has been completed and distributed as a preprint on arxiv , a work discussing the issue of the rotation of the charge order wave vector by @xmath64 has appeared .",
    "@xcite a solution of mean - field equations for a new cdw suggested in the latter work , although very interesting , is not stable against formation of sc / qdw order of ref . below its transition temperature @xmath6 . as a result , new preemptive states predicted in ref .",
    "may be possible only in the vicinity of @xmath6 .",
    "extending the analysis of the spin - fermion model for the two - dimensional antiferromagnetic qcp to the antinodal regions , we find below the pseudogap temperature  @xmath6 another transition to a bidirectional cdw induced at the zone edge by superconducting fluctuations . the physics behind this transition is determined by pseudogap physics emerging at the hotspots .",
    "our theory thus shows how a complexity of offspring phases arises out of the single qcp .",
    "the results enable us to address recently observed charge order features in the phase diagram of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
