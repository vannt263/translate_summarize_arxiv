    "the phenomenon of gravitational lensing is firmly associated with the physics of a four - dimensional lorentzian spacetime that satisfies the einstein equations . yet",
    ", it has become a common practice in the study of lensing to break with the basic ideas of general relativity by using the linearized einstein equations off a fixed background , the thin lens approximation , and treating the bending of light as a linear phenomenon  without mention of its connection with the full theory .",
    "this point of view is very much justified by the accuracy in the comparison of contemporary observations with the resulting calculations , i.e. , general relativity does play an essential role in lensing but the weak field approach appears to be quite adequate for most discussions  @xcite .    however , it is now a fact that the strong field characteristics of general relativity _",
    "per se _ are observed in nature as well .",
    "black holes are possibly ubiquitous  @xcite , and a super - massive black hole may exist in the center of every spiral galaxy . here is where the full theory of general relativity takes the leading part . in order to describe bending of light by black holes or in high curvature regions ,",
    "it is necessary to write lens equations that respect the intrinsic nature of general relativity , namely : covariance and non - linearity .",
    "the difficulty in writing down a lens equation that respects covariance and non - linearity is very much of a conceptual type .",
    "in fact , even when such a lens equation is developed , it is hard to interpret .",
    "a spacetime containing a lens _ is not _ the superposition of two spaces , a background spacetime and a lens space .",
    "two different spacetimes are two different entities , and there are an infinite number of ways of identifying them point - wise . what is the meaning of the angular location of a source _ in the absence of a lens -",
    "_ an idea used extensively in the thin - lens approximation ?",
    "what are the preferred angular coordinates that give the thin - lens equation its meaning ?",
    "how do we refer to the distances between the observer , the source and the lens in a coordinate independent manner , or what is the preferred coordinate distance to use ?",
    "all these questions have perfectly good answers if a background spacetime is available to us and we are given leave to isolate the lensing action from the background .",
    "this is not so if there is no background . without reference to a background , some of these questions have no answers , and some do not even make sense . treating lensing phenomena strictly in the context of the full theory of relativity requires other ideas and approaches .",
    "we have recently introduced a proposal for a lens equation without reference to a background  @xcite .",
    "an exact lens equation on an arbitrary lorentzian spacetime can be written down , at least in principle , since it amounts , basically , to finding all the light - rays that reach the eye of an observer .",
    "however , for it to be meaningful , it is necessary to express the equation in such a way that it can be used in an astrophysical context ; it must be written or expressed in terms of observable quantities . to some extent",
    ", we believe that we have partially succeeded in doing that .    as an illustration ,",
    "we develop and interpret in full detail our lens equation in the case of a schwarzschild black hole ; explicitly working out quantities of astrophysical interest for lensing , such as the angular diameter distance and magnification factors .",
    "furthermore , we use our exact lens equation to test the effectiveness of other lens equations that can be written down in the case that a background is available , most notably the lens equation obtained recently by k. s. virbhadra and g. f. r. ellis  @xcite .    in sec.ii",
    "we discuss the idealized situation where , in principle , the null geodesic equations can be solved exactly for a static metric and stationary source and show , again in principle , how a set of lens equations can be constructed , while in sec.iii these ideas are then applied to the schwarzschild black hole lensing problem . in this section ,",
    "the important physical quantities such as the angular - diameter distance to a source and the magnification factor are explicitly calculated . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we compare the exact results with the thin lens calculations .",
    "we begin with a four - dimensional static spacetime @xmath0 with local coordinates @xmath1 and consider an observer , at rest in the local coordinates , on a world - line given parametrically by @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the observer s proper - time .",
    "the observer , looking out , sees null geodesics reaching him from all past null directions , @xmath4 .",
    "these observed directions , labeled by the spatial projections ( orthogonal to the observer s velocity vector , @xmath5 ) of the null vectors , can be taken as the two angular coordinates of the observer s ( past ) celestial sphere , @xmath6 the null geodesics of the past lightcones from the observer s worldline thus carry these labels ; the points on each null geodesic are further labeled by the parameter along the curve , which we take to be an affine parameter @xmath7 suitably normalized so that @xmath8 .",
    "thus the past lightcone of the observer has the form @xmath9    where the functions @xmath10 satisfy the geodesic equation @xmath11    with @xmath12    and the null condition    @xmath13    the local coordinates @xmath1 can be chosen so that one of them , say @xmath14 , is timelike and the remaining three @xmath15 are spacelike , @xmath16 . in this case , the function @xmath17 does not vanish at any point .",
    "although we are interested in the past lightcone , it is more straightforward to work in terms of the future lightcone .",
    "the direction in which the lightrays are traced is not important in the case of interest , namely , static spacetimes .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is everywhere positive .",
    "this means that @xmath14 increases monotonically with the affine parameter @xmath7 . because @xmath17 does not vanish anywhere , then , by ( [ nullcondition ] ) , at all points on a geodesic one of @xmath19",
    "is non - zero ( different @xmath20 possibly in different sections of the geodesic ) . for definiteness",
    ", we label this spatial coordinate by @xmath21 . from the implicit function theorem",
    ", we have that    @xmath22    can be inverted to obtain    @xmath23    the inversion will only be possible in patches , since it is possible that @xmath24 vanishes at isolated points .",
    "this means that @xmath7 will be , in general , a multiple - valued function of @xmath25 .",
    "still , this inversion allows us to reparametrize the geodesics in terms of just our coordinates and observation angles :    @xmath26    with @xmath27 .",
    "the idea is now to treat these equations as if they determine a source at the spacetime point * *  ( * * @xmath28 in terms of the observable quantities * *  ( * * @xmath29 where we have assumed , _ for the moment _ , that the coordinate value for @xmath25 can be determined from observation .",
    "we will treat the source as slow moving or effectively at rest . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) is defined as the lens equation .",
    "more specifically , we interpret this lens equation as follows .",
    "consider a source at a spatial location @xmath15 , emitting light at time @xmath14 .",
    "we can think of the coordinate @xmath25 as a type of radial coordinate .",
    "the remaining two coordinates @xmath30 are thus a type of angular coordinates .",
    "the emitted light arrives at the observer at a time @xmath3 , in a direction @xmath31 .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) expresses the angular location of a source at radial distance @xmath25 in terms of the observation angles @xmath31 . on the other hand , eq .",

    "the map breaks down at locations where the determinant    @xmath33    vanishes .",
    "@xmath34 defines the caustics ( a three surface in four - space ) of the family of past lightcones of the observer .",
    "the direct consequence of the break - down of the map is that multiple images of the same source can be observed .",
    "more specifically , often one can see an image , in direction @xmath35 , of an object that lies on a null geodesic before it reaches a caustic ( in affine distance ) , while simultaneously seeing a different image , in a different direction @xmath36 , from the same object along a different null geodesic , but , in this case , the object lies beyond the caustic in affine distance .",
    "the parity of the images is given by the sign of @xmath37 .",
    "in background dependent calculations , @xmath38 is often interpreted as a magnification factor with respect to the `` unlensed '' source , but , as we have no background , this would not be appropriate here .",
    "( note that @xmath39 could have been calculated holding @xmath7 fixed instead of fixed @xmath40 the vanishing of @xmath37 is independent of that choice .",
    "this follows from the general theory of lagrangian submanifolds and maps . )",
    "the lens equation , eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) , is not yet entirely usable since it involves the ( up to now ) unobservable quantity @xmath25 .",
    "however , @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of observable quantities through the use of the idea of distance .",
    "though there are many definitions of distance in use in general relativity and astrophysics , several of them can be considered to be observable and we thus explore the feasibility of inferring @xmath25 from the considerations of distance .",
    "we will investigate a definition of distance which is observable , namely the so - called angular - diameter distance - there being several closely related distance definitions  @xcite .",
    "since we have , in principle , exact expressions for the past lightcone of the observer in terms of parameters adapted to the null geodesic congruence , we have a natural way of expressing the angular - diameter distance to the source in exact form .",

    "the thin - lens approximation appears to do very well at these relatively small distances and will almost certainly do much better at galactic and extragalactic distances .",
    "one reason why eq .",

    "the other reason is , however , that the exact bending angle through infinite distances is used .",

    ", one might even find it justified to give up the thin - lens approximation in favor of the exact lens equation in the case of strong , spherically symmetric gravitational fields .",
    "a valuable , second comparison is the time delays predicted by the exact and thin lens approaches .",
    "time delays are now a very important tool in astrophysics and provide a means to estimate the hubble constant independent of previous methods .",

    ", @xmath98 is the euclidean length along the thin lens trajectory , and @xmath275 represents the euclidean distance from the origin to a point along the path .",
    "the thin lens time delay , @xmath276 , is the difference between the two times .    in the exact approach , there are an infinite number of pairs of geodesics connecting the source and observer because geodesics may wrap around the black hole many times . however , there are only two geodesics which do not circle the lens ; these geodesics , which can be distinguished from the others , are the analogue of the thin lens paths . the exact time delay , @xmath277 , is numerically computed from eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) by taking the difference between the times elapsed along these two geodesics .",

    "einstein rings are formed , and each time delay will be zero . as @xmath233 increases , the thin lens time delay slightly overestimates the true value , as seen in the figure .",
    "this represents the general behavior for a single schwarzschild lens at larger distances , but the effect remains fairly small . for a single schwarzschild lens with a mass of @xmath283 solar masses , at redshift @xmath284 with a source at @xmath285 and @xmath286 , the overall exact time delay is close to @xmath287 days , while the error introduced by using the thin lens approximation is less than an hour .",
    "the time delays computed in the thin lens approximation remain quite accurate in our comparisons because the light rays do not feel a strong gravitational field along their trajectories .",
    "this is why the thin lens fails so dramatically in the observation angle calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , while fairing well in the time delay comparisons .    despite these results",
    ", it may be incorrect to assume that the thin lens method of computing time delays remains accurate for more complex lensing situations .",
    "the first of two possible problems is that the weak field assumption may not always be valid along an observed null geodesic .",
    "it may be very difficult to identify lens candidates whose null geodesics have undergone interactions with strong gravitational fields , however , if such candidates are found , the thin lens methodology will most likely prove quite inaccurate .",
    "secondly , it is not known how accurate the time delay computations will be in more complex lensing scenarios , especially when the geodesics are bent in multiple lens planes .",
    "to date , virtually all applications of gravitational lensing have utilized the thin lens approximation .",

    "these analytic expressions can be used in comparison calculations or model building with great computational prowess , power , or time .",
    "the limited testing of the thin - lens methodology in this paper has indicated that there are regions ( possibly not yet observable ) where the thin - lens method fails in a highly symmetric case . in ongoing calculations",
    ", we are exploring the accuracy of the thin lens approximation under a broad range of conditions , including those in which there may be stronger fields or multiple lenses present .",

    "a precedent for this kind of work was set by rauch and blandford  @xcite , who studied the null geodesic equations ( or the exact lens equations in our terminology ) for kerr spacetime and found the caustics of the lightcone .",
    "our sense from these comparisons is that the error in the thin lens method for the time delays and observation angles will , in some cases , be appreciable  @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in an issue regarding the comparison of the sizes of two different types of corrections to the thin lens equations . on one hand , within the framework of the thin lens methodology , there are corrections due to the structure of the mass distribution ( of the lens ) over that of the monopole moment .",
    "on the other hand , even for the monopole case , there are differences between the predictions of the exact lens equations and the thin lens equations .",
