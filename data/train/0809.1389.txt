    "the high fluence values ( from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) and the enormous isotropic energy emitted ( @xmath10 ) at the peak in a single short pulse make gamma ray bursts ( hereafter grbs ) the most violent and energetic astrophysical phenomena . notwithstanding the variety of their different peculiarities , some common features may be identified looking at their light curves . although grbs have been traditionally classified as _",
    "short _ and _ long _ depending on @xmath11 being smaller or larger than @xmath12 ( with @xmath11 the time over which from @xmath13 to @xmath14 of the prompt emission is released ) , a recent analysis by donaghy et al .",
    "has shown that this criterion has to be revised .",
    "indeed , the existence of an intermediated class of grbs have also been studied @xcite . as a result , the long grbs are now further classified as _",
    "normal _ and _ low luminosity _ with the latter ones probably associated with supernovae @xcite .",
    "notwitstanding this classification , two phases are clearly visible in the grb lightcurve , namely the prompt emission , where most of the energy is released in the @xmath15-rays in only tens of seconds , and an afterglow lasting many hours after the initial bursts .",
    "early observations in the x - rays typically started several hours after the prompt emission so that only the late phase of the light curve could be characterized .",
    "it was then found that a phenomenological power - law , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , provided a reasonable fit to the observed data @xcite .",
    "however , the launch of the _ swift _ satellite , whose aim is also to observe grbs x - ray ( @xmath18 ) and optical ( @xmath19  ) afterglows starting few seconds after the trigger , revealed a more complex behaviour .",
    "the soft x - ray light curves must indeed be divided in two different classes @xcite according to the steep or mild initial decay .",
    "most of the observed grb afterglows belong to the first group , showing what has been called a _ canonical _",
    "behavior @xcite described by a broken power - law .",
    "after the initial steep decay ( with slope @xmath20 ) , the light curve shows a shallow decay ( @xmath21 ) followed by a somewhat steeper decay ( @xmath22 ) beyond @xmath23 .",
    "these power - law segments are separated by two corresponding break times with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a new systematic study using grbs observed with xrt reveals a still more complex behavior with different power - law slopes and break times @xcite .",
    "a significant step forward has been represented by the analysis of the x - ray afterglow curves of the full sample of _ swift _ grbs showing that all of them may be fitted by the same analytical expression @xcite .    finding out a universal feature for grbs is the first important step towards their use as distance indicator . to this aim",
    ", one has indeed to look for a universal relation linking observable grbs properties so that their intrinsic luminosity may be estimated from directly measurable quantities .",
    "previous attempts along this road are represented by the @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , three - parameter relations have also been proposed such as , e.g. , the @xmath32 @xcite and that proposed by firmani and collaborators ( firmani et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , some attempts have also been made to compare these empirical correlations with the model dependent ones @xcite .",
    "the above quoted two parameters correlations have then been used by schaefer ( 2007 , hereafter s07 ) to construct the first reliable grbs hubble diagram extending up to @xmath33 opening the way towards the use of grbs as cosmological probes ( see , e.g. , capozziello & izzo 2008 and refs . therein ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present a possible alternative route towards standardizing grbs as distance indicator . to this aim",
    ", we use the data in willingale et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to look for a possible correlation between the x - ray luminosity at the break time @xmath1 and the @xmath1 itself .",
    "the data used are presented in sect .",
    "2 , while sect . 3 deals with the statistical tools and the results .",
    "conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "willingale et al . ( 2007 , hereafter w07 ) have examined the x - ray decay curves of all the grbs measured by the _ swift _",
    "satellite then available .",
    "their analysis shows that all of them may be well fitted by a simple two components formula , namely :    @xmath34    where the first term accounts for the prompt @xmath15-ray emission and the initial x - ray decay , while the second one describes the afterglow .",
    "both components are given by the same functional expression :    @xmath35    where the transition from the exponential to the power , law decay takes place at the point @xmath36 where the two functional sections match in value and gradient .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 determines both the time constant of the exponential decay ( given by @xmath38 ) and the slope of the following decay , while @xmath39 marks the initial rise and the time of maximum flux occuring at @xmath40 . denoting with the suffix @xmath41 and @xmath42 quantities for the prompt and afterglow components , eq.([eq : fc ] )",
    "may be inserted into eq.([eq : fluxtot ] ) to give an eight parameters expression that can be fitted to the x - ray decay curve in order to both validate this expression and determine , for each grb , the corresponding parameters .",
    "such a task has been indeed performed by w07 using all the 107 grbs detected by both bat and the xrt on _ swift _ up to august 1st 2006 .",
    "the fit procedure and the detailed analysis of the results are presented in w07 , while here we only remind that the usual @xmath43 fitting in the @xmath44 vs @xmath45 provide estimates and uncertainties on the time parameters @xmath46 and the products @xmath47 .",
    "w07 also performed spectral fitting with xspec @xcite to bat ( for the prompt phase ) and xrt ( for later phases ) data to estimate the spectral index during different phases . due to the limited frequency range ,",
    "the grb spectrum may be simply described by a single power - law , @xmath48 , with the slope @xmath49 depending on the time when the spectrum is observed .",
    "w07 reported four different values of @xmath49 , namely @xmath50 ( for the prompt phase ) , @xmath51 for the prompt decay , @xmath52 for the plateau observed at the time @xmath1 , and @xmath53 for the afterglow at @xmath54 .",
    "actually , the data coverage is not sufficient to measure all of them for the full sample so that , for the weakest bursts , only @xmath50 and @xmath51 are available . provided @xmath49 is known , it is possible to estimate the grb luminosity at a given time @xmath55 as :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the luminosity distance at the grb redshift @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the flux ( in @xmath60 ) at the time @xmath55 , @xmath61-corrected @xcite as :    @xmath62    with @xmath63 set by the instrument bandpass .",
    "note that eq.([eq : lx ] ) is the same as eq.(8 ) in s07 the only difference being the integration limits of the integral at the numerator .",
    "actually , while s07 is interested to the bolometric luminosity , we are here concerned with the x - ray one so that we integrate only over this energy range .",
    "using the data in w07 , we compute the x - ray luminosity at the time @xmath1 so that we have to set @xmath64 and @xmath65 in eqs.([eq : lx ] ) and ( [ eq : fx ] ) .",
    "actually , rather than using eq.([eq : fluxtot ] ) , we set @xmath66 since the contribution of the prompt component is typically smaller than @xmath13 , much lower than the statistical uncertainty on @xmath67 . neglecting @xmath68 thus allows to reduce the error on @xmath69 without introducing any bias .",
    "this latter error is then estimated by simply propagating those on @xmath52 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 thus implicitly assuming that their covariance is null confidence ranges .",
    "following willingale ( priv .",
    "comm . ) , we have assumed independent gaussian errors and obtained @xmath72 uncertainties by roughly dividing by 1.65 the @xmath73 errors . moreover , we preliminary correct for asymmetric errors on @xmath71 and @xmath70 ( when present ) following the prescriptions in d agostini ( 2004 ) . ]",
    ". should this not be the case , we are underestimating the final error on @xmath0 .",
    "we have , however , checked that our main results are unaffected by a reasonable increase of the errors .",
    "as a final important remark , we note that the presence of the luminosity distance @xmath74 in eq.([eq : lx ] ) constrains us to adopt a cosmological model to compute @xmath0 .",
    "we use a flat @xmath75cdm model so that the hubble free luminosity distance reads :    @xmath76    in agreement with the wmap five year results @xcite , we set @xmath77 with @xmath78 the hubble constant @xmath79 in units of @xmath80 .",
    "in order to standardize grbs to use them as possible distance indicator , we need to find a correlation between the luminosity and a directly observable quantity .",
    "should such a relation be found , one can then use the observed flux and the estimated @xmath81 to infer @xmath57 and then construct the grb hubble diagram . let us suppose that a power - law relation exists between two quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 as @xmath84 . in logarithmic units ,",
    "this reads @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "typically , both @xmath82 and @xmath83 will be known with measurement errors ( @xmath88 so that the statistical uncertainties on @xmath89 will be given by @xmath90 respectively .",
    "these errors may be comparable so that it is not possible to decide what is the independent variable to be used in the usual @xmath43 fitting analysis .",
    "moreover , the relation @xmath84 may be affected by an intrinsic scatter @xmath91 of unknown nature that has to be taken into account . in order to determine the parameters @xmath92",
    ", we can then follow a bayesian approach @xcite thus maximizing the likelihood function @xmath93}$ ] with :    @xmath94    with @xmath95 and the sum is over the @xmath96 objects in the sample .",
    "note that , actually , this maximization is performed in the two parameter space @xmath97 since @xmath42 may be estimated analytically as :    @xmath98 \\left [ \\sum{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{int}^2 + \\sigma_{y_i}^2 + b^2 \\sigma_{x_i}^2 } } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\label{eq : calca}\\ ] ]    so that we will not consider it anymore as a fit parameter .",
    "[ fig : bfallplot ]    we use this general recipe to look for a correlation between the x - ray luminosity ( in @xmath99 ) at the time @xmath1 and @xmath1 ( in @xmath100 ) itself , i.e. we set @xmath101}$ ] and @xmath102}$ ] , where we divide time by @xmath103 to account for the cosmological time dilation .",
    "note that , since @xmath52 is needed to compute @xmath0 , we have to reject most of the 107 grbs reported in w07 because this is not known .",
    "we thus end up with a sample contanining @xmath104 with both @xmath2}$ ] and @xmath3}$ ] measured .",
    "the spearman rank correlation turns out to be @xmath105 suggesting that a power - law relation between @xmath0 and @xmath106 indeed exists thus motivating further analysis .",
    "we then apply the maximum likelihood estimator described above in order to determine both the slope and the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath7 correlation thus finding out :    @xmath107    defining the best fit residuals as @xmath108 , we can qualitatively estimate the goodness of the fit by considering the median and root mean square which turn out to be @xmath109 and @xmath110 indeed quite small if compared to the typical @xmath2}$ ] values .",
    "it is also worth noting that @xmath111 does not correlate with the other parameters of the fit flux , while the value @xmath112 between @xmath111 and @xmath58 favours no significative evolution of the @xmath7 relation with the redshift .",
    "the best fit relation is superimposed to the data in fig.1 where we also present the best fit obtained by the usual @xmath43 fitting technique . in this case , the best fit parameters are obtained by minimizing ( through a levemberg - marquardt algorithm with @xmath113 outliers rejection ) a @xmath43 merit function given by the second term in eq.([eq : deflike ] ) with @xmath114 , i.e. we ( erroneously ) assume that there is no scatter and that the errors on @xmath2}$ ] are negligible .",
    "this alternative method gives as best fit parameters :    @xmath115    in good agreement with the above maximum likelihood estimator so that we argue that our results are independent on the fitting method .",
    "however , since the bayesian approach is better motivated and also allows for an intrinsic scatter , we hereafter elige this as our preferred technique .    , but only using grbs with @xmath116 } \\le 5 $ ] and @xmath2 } \\ge 45$].,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] [ fig : bfbestplot ]    in an attempt to reduce the intrinsic scatter in the above correlation , we have analysed the best fit residuals noting that the higher ones are obtained for grbs with luminosities smaller than @xmath117 and time parameter @xmath3 } > 5 $ ] .",
    "we therefore repeated the above analysis using only 28 out of 32 grbs of the @xmath11 range .",
    "moreover , for grb060607a , the prompt component dominates over the afterglow one so that our approximation @xmath118 is not valid anymore .",
    "] satisfying the two selection criteria @xmath116 } \\le 5 $ ] and @xmath119 } \\ge 45 $ ] . using the maximum likelihood estimator , we get :    @xmath120    with @xmath121 and @xmath122 . the reduced intrinsic scatter and the smaller fit residuals suggest us that , whatever is the unknown mechanism originating the @xmath7 relation , this is better effective for the class of grbs satisfying the above selection criteria .",
    "the data and the best fit curve are shown in fig.2 where the dashed line refers to the results obtained with the @xmath43 minimization giving @xmath123 reported here for completeness .",
    "the bayesian approach used here also allows us to quantify the uncertainties on the fit parameters . to this aim , for a given parameter @xmath124 , we first compute the marginalized likelihood @xmath125 by integrating over the other parameter . the median value for the parameter @xmath124 is then found by solving :    @xmath126    the @xmath127 ( @xmath14 ) confidence range @xmath128 are then found by solving :    @xmath129    @xmath130    with @xmath131 ( 0.95 ) for the @xmath127 ( @xmath14 ) range respectively . for the fit to the full dataset , we get :    @xmath132    while it is :    @xmath133    for the selected subsample .",
    "the high spearman correlation coefficient , the low value of the fit residuals and the modest intrinsic scatter renders the @xmath7 relation presented above a new valid tool to standardize grbs .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath7 needs only two parameters and one of them is directly inferred form the observations minimizing the effects of the systematics errors .",
    "furthermore the redshift range covered is large extending from @xmath134 @xmath135 up to 6.6 for the selected ( full ) sample far beyond the maximum redshift affordable with type ia sne ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "should this correlation be confirmed by future higher quality data , one could then combine it with the other relations yet available in literature to work out a grbs hubble diagram deep into the matter dominated era thus representing an outstanding cosmological test .    to this end , it is worth comparing the @xmath7 relation with other ones quoted in literature .",
    "when performing such a comparison , however , one should take into account the differences in the cosmological model adopted and the fitting method used .",
    "in particular , the choice of how the best fit parameters are estimated may have an important impact on the estimate of the intrinsic scatter with the usual @xmath43 fitting leading to an underestimate of @xmath91 . on the other hand , changing @xmath5 in the framework of the flat @xmath75cdm scenario have a profound impact on @xmath91 with higher @xmath5 giving rise to lower @xmath91 values @xcite . in order to account for both these issues",
    ", one should therefore test all the above correlations using the same statistical tools and cosmological model , a task we will address elsewhere .    as is well known , the paucity of local ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) grbs represents a serious problem for any attempt to standardize grbs since it is very difficult to directly calibrate any relation .",
    "this problem may be partly overcome by fitting the correlation in a subsample of grbs lying at similar redshift @xcite .",
    "however , as a general rule , in order to evaluate the grb luminosity , a cosmological model has to be adopted thus leading to the circularity problem .",
    "although addressing this problem in detail will be the subject of a forthcoming work , we have here investigated what is the effect of changing the cosmological model by using our maximum likelihood estimator to determine the parameters @xmath138 as function of @xmath5 in a flat @xmath75cdm model running from @xmath139 to @xmath140 and adjust @xmath78 so that @xmath141 is fixed to the same value adopted above . ] .",
    "we find the remarkable result that both the best fit parameters @xmath97 and the rms residual @xmath142 are almost insensitive to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , @xmath143 runs from @xmath144 to @xmath145 , while @xmath91 increases from @xmath146 to @xmath147 for @xmath5 going from 0.2 to 1.0 . as a further test",
    ", we generalize the @xmath75cdm model varying not only the matter density parameter @xmath5 , but also the equation of state @xmath6 of the dark energy component ( with @xmath148 for the @xmath75cdm model ) . for @xmath149 ,",
    "neither @xmath143 nor @xmath91 significantly change confirming the qualitative results obtained for the @xmath75cdm scenario .",
    "although a more detailed analysis is needed , we therefore argue that the circularity problem is alleviated by the use of our @xmath7 relation .",
    "the encouraging results discussed above are serious arguments in favour of the @xmath7 relation as a further tool towards the standardization of grbs as distance indicator",
    ". should these first evidences be furtherly enforced by more data , the combined use of full set of grbs correlations discovered insofar could opened the road towards making grbs the high redshift analog of sneia as cosmological probes in the not too distant future .",
