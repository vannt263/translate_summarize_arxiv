    "one of the most important advances in high - energy astrophysics in recent years is the discovery of 271 persistent high energy @xmath0-ray sources by the egret instrument aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( _ cgro _ , hartman  1999 ) . while the detection of these sources is a major success , identification of their nature and origin",
    "has turned out to be a more challenging task .",
    "the principal method of identification , which relies on statistical evidence that blazars are the dominant population , is to find positional coincidences between egret sources and flat - spectrum radio / millimeter sources ( thompson  1995 , 1996 ; mattox  1997 ; bloom et al .",
    "1997 ) . by definition blazars",
    "are flat - spectrum , radio - loud agns with polarized and variable optical emission .",
    "although numerous efforts have been made at various wavelengths , only about one third of all egret sources have been identified with any degree of confidence . on the latest count",
    "these identifications include 66 blazars , , flat - spectrum radio quasars or bl  lac objects ( hartman  1999 ) , seven rotation - powered pulsars ( hartman  1999 , kaspi  2000 , ramanamurthy  1995 ) , the nearby radio galaxy cen a , and the large magellanic cloud . therefore approximately 196 egret sources remain unidentified with roughly half of these located at high galactic latitude , @xmath8 .    many difficulties attend the identification of egret sources close to the galactic plane , but even at high galactic latitude , the size of the typical error circle and the lack of a tight relation between gamma - ray flux and other properties such as x - ray flux and core radio flux prevent all but the brightest counterparts from being identified securely on the basis of position alone .",
    "the absence of obvious counterparts also admits the possibility that there is another population with characteristics unlike the identified egret sources . we have decided to explore the latter possibility by means of detailed work at other wavelengths , while in the long term the situation should improve considerably with the next generation high - energy @xmath0-ray mission _ glast _ , which will produce more precise source locations .",
    "we have chosen for a case study the unidentified egret source .",
    "this object may be the best candidate for the prototype of a new population different from blazars or pulsars .",
    "it is the brightest of the as - yet unidentified egret sources at high galactic latitude ( @xmath1 ) , and the one with the smallest error circle . because it is strongly detected and well away from the confusing diffuse emission in the galactic plane ,  is localized to within a radius of only @xmath9 at 99% confidence , which makes a deep multiwavelength search for a counterpart feasible .",
    "the latest analysis of the egret observations of  leads to the conclusion that it shows no strong evidence for variability ( reimer  2000 ) .",
    "its spectrum can be fitted by a power law of photon index 1.7 from 70  mev to 4  gev , with a turndown above 4  gev .",
    "such temporal and spectral behavior is more consistent with a rotation - powered pulsar than a blazar .",
    "unlike , blazars are highly variable , and exhibit steeper spectra .    prior to the observations reported herein , there were no known active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or pulsars in the error circle of .",
    "examination of existing catalogs finds no flat - spectrum radio source ( mattox  1997 ) , no 1.4  ghz radio source of any type brighter than 4  mjy in the nrao - vla sky survey catalog ( nvss , condon  1998 ) , and no 4.85  ghz source brighter than 20  mjy ( becker , white , & edwards  1991 ) .",
    "observations by nice & sayer ( 1997 ) find and no radio pulsar to an upper limit of 1  mjy at 770  mhz .",
    "furthermore , all of the known gamma - ray blazars and pulsars appear brighter in x - rays than the upper limit that we shall present for . in light of these facts ,  can not be a blazar unless it is a radio - quiet one ( requiring a redefinition of this concept ) , nor a pulsar unless , as we shall show , it is one with unprecedented characteristics .",
    "in this paper we present the results of radio , x - ray , and optical observations of the location of .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows :  2 describes our multiwavelength data acquisition and selection techniques .",
    " 3 describes the optical spectroscopy of candidates and the overall results .",
    " 4 details notable properties of individual objects and assesses their prospects as the identification of .",
    "multiwavelength comparisons with known @xmath0-ray sources are addressed in  5 , and the implications and conclusions of our work are discussed in   6 and 7 .",
    "the principal body of optical data for this study is a series of standard @xmath10 and cousins @xmath11 ccd images of the error circle of  which we obtained using the mdm observatory 1.3 m telescope during a photometric run in 1998 june and july .",
    "a thinned , back - illuminated @xmath12 site ccd was used to cover a @xmath13 field with multiple exposures .",
    "a mosaic of four such overlapping fields enabled us to observe a @xmath14 region centered on the most likely egret source position ( b. dingus , private communication ) .",
    "our images thus cover the entire 99% confidence region specified in the third egret catalog ( hartman  1999 ) , which can be approximated as an ellipse of major axis @xmath15 . in 1997",
    "july we had covered the same field in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands only , and all of the @xmath16-band images were used to search for variability on long ( year ) and short ( hours to days ) time scales .",
    "the images were processed using standard iraf / daophot procedures .",
    "approximately 5000 objects were measured inside a @xmath18 radius circle .",
    "the photometry described here was calibrated using landolt standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "typical limiting detections achieved were @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "galactic extinction in this field is small but not negligible ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) give @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "magnitudes quoted in this paper are observed , , not corrected for extinction .",
    "we derived a list of qso candidates from this photometry using the standard ultraviolet excess selection technique . following hall  ( 1996 ) , we required plausible quasar candidates to have either @xmath26 and @xmath27 , or @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this selection is effective in separating qsos from the stellar locus , and is efficient in detecting them out to @xmath30 ( hall  1996 ; fan 1999 ) .",
    "we note that of the current identifications in the 3eg catalog , which are unbiased by optical selection , the largest redshift is only @xmath31 , and all of their optical counterparts are brighter than @xmath32 .",
    "our color selection should also permit the discovery of any object that has a power - law continuum , which produces a uv excess , and especially a synchrotron spectrum which peaks above the optical band , , those blazars commonly referred to as high - energy peaked .",
    "thus , our technique is sensitive to most of the known egret blazars , and useful to search for a uv excess counterpart that might be expected on the basis of the absence of strong radio emission .",
    "the major complication in this search comes in separating quasars from white dwarfs , blue field stars , and compact emission - line galaxies which often have similar blue colors and are known major contaminants of quasar color surveys .",
    "further criteria can be applied using additional colors , but we decided to allow maximum freedom in the selection criteria in order to avoid excluding possibly interesting candidates .",
    "a total of 40 such candidates to a limiting magnitude of @xmath33 were selected for follow - up spectroscopy . in subsequent sections of this paper",
    "we discuss the eight qsos that were discovered in our spectroscopic observations .",
    "a total of three x - ray observations were made that cover the entire 99% error ellipse of , two by the  high resolution imager ( hri ) and one by .",
    "the first  observation took place on 1995 february 24 , with a total exposure time of 9,186  s. five point - like x - ray sources were detected in this image , which reached a minimum detectable intrinsic flux of @xmath34  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 in the 0.12.4  kev band , assuming a power - law spectrum with photon index 2.0 and galactic @xmath35  @xmath3 .",
    "a longer hri observation of the same field was obtained between 1997 december 15 and 1998 january 20 , with a total exposure time of 61,269  s. this deeper observation detected a number of fainter x - ray sources above a limiting unabsorbed flux of @xmath36  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , including four of the five previous sources , as well as 10 new ones .",
    "nine sources fall within the 99% confidence ellipse of .",
    "all of these sources are listed in table  1 , together with information about their optical identifications , which are radio - quiet qsos or coronal emitting stars .",
    "the hri astrometry was recalibrated using the optical counterparts of five well - localized x - ray sources , for which an average translation of @xmath37 was required . after this shift ,",
    "the five fiducial x - ray sources have a dispersion of only @xmath38 from their optical positions .",
    "in table  1 we list optical position , or recalibrated x - ray position in the case that no firm optical identification has been made .",
    "x - ray fluxes are calculated assuming a power law of photon index 2.0 and the full galactic @xmath39 for qsos and unidentified sources , and a raymond - smith thermal plasma of @xmath40  k and @xmath41  @xmath3 for stars .",
    "an  observation took place from 1998 april 2022 for a total clean exposure time of @xmath42  s in each of the two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the combined gis image . the detection threshold for this  observation was @xmath43  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ( 110  kev ) assuming a photon index of 1.7 .",
    "several sources are detected far from the egret error ellipse , and only one faint source falls within it , a radio - quiet qso at @xmath44 that was also detected by . in table",
    "1 we give information about this and four additional  sources outside the egret error ellipse that we were able to identify .    diffuse x - ray emission at the western edge of the  gis image appears to be coming from an uncatalogued cluster of galaxies that is evident on our ccd images .",
    "we have not attempted to measure the x - ray flux of this source as it is too close to the edge of the detector and may extend outside it .",
    "the brightest galaxies in this vicinity are members of the cluster at @xmath45 and have @xmath46 and @xmath47 , at j2000 coordinates @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this x - ray source is well outside the  error ellipse , and we have no reason to suspect that they are related .",
    "in particular , there is no evidence of an agn in this cluster .",
    "the field of view of the  solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) detectors , even when operated in 4-ccd mode during this observation , is too small to cover the egret error ellipse .",
    "no x - ray sources were detected in the sis images , so we do not discuss them further here .",
    "we reduced an archival vla observation of this field which was taken at a frequency of 1.4 ghz on 1995 february 21 in the d configuration .",
    "we found 14 sources stronger than 2.5  mjy in the neighborhood of .",
    "they have a positional accuracy of approximately @xmath50 for the fainter sources , and @xmath51 for sources stronger than 15  mjy . for completeness",
    ", we examined the nvss catalog at the same frequency to confirm six more faint sources that were marginally detected in the 1995 pointing . to incorporate information at other radio frequencies",
    ", we searched the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) , which covered this field to a limiting flux of 18mjy at 326 mhz ( rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the nrao 4.85 ghz catalog of becker  ( 1991 ) , which has a flux limit of 20  mjy at this location",
    ". a combined total of 20 radio sources were found inside and outside the error ellipse .",
    "their properties are listed in table  2 , and their positions are shown in figure  2",
    ". most notably , there are no flat - spectrum sources in this field , and there are only three sources within the 99% confidence error ellipse of , all fainter than 4  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "we used a number of spectrographs to obtain moderate - resolution spectra of candidate x - ray and radio counterparts as well as uv excess objects selected from our optical imaging survey .",
    "these instruments include the goldcam spectrograph on the kpno 2.1 m telescope , the mark iii spectrograph on the mdm 1.3 m mcgraw - hill and 2.4 m hiltner telescopes , the kast double spectrograph on the 3 m shane reflector at lick observatory , the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ) on the hobby - eberly telescope , and the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the keck ii telescope .",
    "most spectra were analyzed independently by two authors and an agreement on classification was reached after comparing separate findings .",
    "the spectra were analyzed for emission and absorption lines and classified as either as star , galaxy , white dwarf , agn , or uncertain .",
    "we have completed spectroscopy to a limiting magnitude of @xmath52 , which includes 43 out of 53 optical candidates .",
    "in addition we have spectra of two objects fainter than @xmath52 .",
    "finding charts for the classified objects are given in figures  3 and 4 , and their spectra are shown in figures  5 and 6 .",
    "thus far we have found eight qsos by the uv excess technique in the magnitude range @xmath53 .",
    "their redshifts range from 0.504 to 2.21 .",
    "these are listed in table  3 and their positions are shown in figure  2 . by design , they all fall within or very close to the  error ellipse .",
    "the efficiency of our color selection agrees fairly well with the number counts reported by koo & kron ( 1998 ) and hall  ( 1996 ) , which would predict that six qsos with @xmath54 and @xmath55 would be found within a region of this size .",
    "several additional candidates were found to have featureless blue spectra that we can not securely classify . since their colors are consistent with those of white dwarfs , we suspect that they are of the weak - lined ( dc ) variety .    of the x - ray sources , six have been identified with radio - quiet qsos , including five that were independently selected by uv excess colors .",
    "a seventh x - ray quasar is an  and radio source at @xmath56 that lies well outside the egret error circle .",
    "four more x - ray sources are identified with coronal emitting stars of types g , k , and dme whose x - ray fluxes are normal for their optical magnitudes .",
    "two radio sources outside the egret error ellipse are identified with bright , early type galaxies at redshifts of 0.106 and 0.156 , respectively , that lack any emission lines or evidence of non - stellar continuum in their optical spectra ( figure  6 ) .",
    "neither of these are promising @xmath0-ray source candidates .",
    "the lower - redshift galaxy is close to the x - ray emitting galaxy cluster that is west of the egret error ellipse and it is apparently a member of the cluster .",
    "we have had less success in identifying the faint radio sources within the egret error ellipse .",
    "bright optical objects near their positions have proven to be ordinary stars , indicating that their true optical counterparts are likely to be fainter than our limiting magnitude for spectroscopy .",
    "finding charts for both of the radio galaxies , as well as for several unidentified radio sources , are displayed in figures  3 and 4 .",
    "rx  j1834.1 + 5913 : this is the brightest quasar in the egret error ellipse ( @xmath57 ) and it is detected by both  and .",
    "its x - ray flux decreased between the two rosat observations , from @xmath58  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 in 1995 to @xmath59  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 in 199798 .",
    "however , we are cautious about this variability since the source was near the edge of the detector in the later observation .",
    "we have several optical measurements of it in 1997 , 1998 , 1999 which also show modest variability . the largest change of @xmath60 magnitudes occurred between 1998 june and 1999 september , but there is no evidence for rapid variability on time scales of days . in addition , the equivalent width of its mg  ii emission line did not vary in spectra taken at two different epochs .",
    "thus , the spectral and variability properties of rx  j1834.1 + 5913 offer no strong reason to argue that it is a candidate identification for .",
    "however , as the brightest qso in the egret error ellipse , it does warrant continued scrutiny . in  5 , we compare the properties of this source to those of the identified egret blazars in order to illustrate how unusual any agn counterpart of  must be .",
    "uvq j1834.3 + 5926 : at @xmath61 , this is the highest redshift qso that we have found near . its optical spectrum is somewhat unusual in that it is the reddest of all the qsos in this field , and its emission lines are broad but weak .",
    "we suspect that its ly  @xmath62 line , which falls just blueward of our keck spectrum , is responsible for boosting its @xmath63-band flux and helping it to meet the uv excess criterion .",
    "rx  j1834.4 + 5920 : this relatively bright  source ( @xmath64  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , assuming a @xmath40  k thermal plasma spectrum ) remains unidentified , although it lies near the edge of the hri detector where the point - spread function is very poor .",
    "an m star of magnitude @xmath65 has been suggested as a possible identification even though it lies @xmath66 from the x - ray position ( carramiana  2000 ) .",
    "vla j1834.7 + 5918 : this faint radio source of 3.7  mjy remains without spectroscopy , yet a blue optical object with @xmath67 falls just inside the western boundary of its error circle ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "although lacking x - ray emission , it is still a possible quasar or bl  lac object and worth further study , especially spectroscopy of the optical candidate .",
    "since this is the brightest and most promising radio source of those within the egret error ellipse , we adopt its radio flux as an upper limit for  in subsequent discussion .",
    "vla j1835.1 + 5906 : this is the brightest radio galaxy ( @xmath68 ) at the edge of the egret error ellipse .",
    "its optical spectrum was examined for any evidence of a bl  lac object in its nucleus , the principal indicator of which would be a shallower than normal break at 4000  . however , no such evidence is seen .",
    "this plus its steep radio spectrum , @xmath69 between 1.4 and 4.85  ghz and absence of x - ray emission argue against vla j1835.1 + 5906 being a bl  lac identification of .",
    "vla j1835.6 + 5939 ( = ax  j1835.7 + 5939 ) : this is a quasar at @xmath56 and the brightest radio source near , with a 1.4 ghz flux of 359 mjy . however , it is outside of the 99% error ellipse by @xmath70 , and this plus its steep radio spectrum , @xmath71 between 1.4 and 4.85  ghz , argue against considering it as a strong @xmath0-ray candidate .",
    "rx  j1836.2 + 5925 : this is perhaps the most intriguing object found in all of our searches .",
    "it was the brightest x - ray source within the error ellipse ( @xmath72  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ) , at least during the second  observation , but it was undetected in the first  pointing or in the  observation .",
    "thus , it must have varied by at least a factor of 2 in the long term , although it emitted steadily over the one - month span which comprises the second  observation .",
    "rx  j1836.2 + 5925 of interest here primarily because it does not have an optical counterpart in any color ( figure  7 ) to limits of @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "a red stellar object of @xmath75 is located @xmath76 west of the x - ray centroid , but it is not a viable candidate given the precision with which several other x - ray sources in this field line up with their established optical counterparts . as described above , the hri astrometry in this figure was recalibrated using the optical counterparts of five well - localized x - ray sources , for which an average translation of @xmath37 was required . after this shift",
    ", the five x - ray sources have a dispersion of only @xmath38 from their optical positions .",
    "thus , the illustrated error box which is @xmath77 on a side must include the true position beyond a reasonable doubt .",
    "none of the optical objects near the error box of rx  j1836.2 + 5925 show any proper motion which could account for their positional discrepancy with the x - ray source .",
    "we have not obtained spectroscopy for any of these faint neighbors , but a deeper and more exhaustive optical study of this x - ray source would be important to evaluate its qualifications as a possible new type of @xmath0-ray source counterpart . by the definition of stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , this x - ray source has an x - ray to optical flux ratio @xmath78",
    ". such a high ratio is found only among low - mass x - ray binaries and isolated neutron stars .",
    "as we argue below , neither of these object classifications would make  compatible with the broad - band spectra of the well - identified egret sources .",
    "if rx  j1836.2 + 5925 is not the counterpart of , then it might be similar to the newly discovered class of luminous soft x - ray transients that have been found by  in the nuclei of non - active galaxies .",
    "these are as luminous as @xmath79  erg  s@xmath4 and last for several months ( grupe , thomas , & leighly 1999 ; komossa & greiner 1999 ; komossa & bade 1999 ) .",
    "a promising interpretation of these events is tidal disruption and accretion of stellar debris by a central black hole .",
    "if rx  j1836.2 + 5925 is such an event , then it could reside in a host galaxy at @xmath80 which deeper optical imaging could detect .",
    "our radio , optical , and x - ray data on active objects in the field of  can be compared with other identified egret sources to evaluate whether can still fall within the multiwavelength parameters of any of the known classes of @xmath0-ray emitters . beginning with blazars ,",
    "figure  8 shows radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray fluxes of the sample of well - identified egret blazars defined by mattox  ( 1997 , and personal communication ) .  and",
    "_ einstein _ fluxes are taken from fossati  ( 1998 ) , and @xmath16 magnitudes and total 4.85  ghz radio fluxes from mattox ( personal communication ) .",
    "the egret spectral points from  are taken from reimer  ( 2000 ) .",
    "of the numerous candidate identifications which we could superpose , we chose two , namely , the brightest qso within the error ellipse ( rx  j1834.1 + 5913 , @xmath44 ) , and the brightest radio source within the error ellipse ( vla j1834.7 + 5918 ) .",
    "for the latter , we hypothesize that the suggestive @xmath67 optical identification is correct , and we graph an x - ray upper limit from the deeper  observation . for the qso , we assign an upper limit of 0.5 mjy at 1.4  ghz , from the vla image .",
    "the smooth curves fitted to these two candidates correspond to the sum of two empirical third - order polynomials as applied by comastri  ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is not a model of blazar emission , but only a guide to the eye in making empirical estimates of the peak fluxes at low and high energy . in doing",
    "so we assume the presence of two emission mechanisms , a low - energy synchrotron component and a high - energy component peaking in the @xmath0-ray band , possibly due to inverse compton scattering .    while the optical and x - ray properties of our brightest candidates are not unprecedented , they lie at the faint end of the distributions . in particular , the x - ray upper limit for vla j1834.7 + 5918 ( or any of the other radio sources in the error ellipse ) falls below the faintest blazars by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "more significant are their faint radio fluxes which , in the case of vla j1834.7 + 5918 is two orders of magnitude fainter than the faintest radio counterpart of any well - identified egret blazar .",
    "rx 1834 + 5913 is nearly three orders of magnitude fainter in the radio band .",
    "figure  9 , in which the ratio of 4.85  ghz flux density to the peak @xmath0-ray flux in the range @xmath81  mev is graphed as a function of @xmath0-ray flux for the mattox blazars , confirms the highly discrepant positions of any of the qsos or radio sources which are positionally coincident with  and candidates for identification with it .",
    "( we assume in this figure a flat radio spectrum for , since none of its faint candidates were actually detected at 4.85  ghz . )",
    "another property of the majority of egret blazars is their rapid and large - amplitude flux variations .",
    "the absence of such obvious @xmath0-ray variability from  already argues against a blazar nature for it ( reimer  2000 ) .",
    "we have also searched our @xmath16-band images obtained in 1997 and 1998 for objects with rapid or extreme optical variability , looking for variations of @xmath82 .",
    "apart from the modest variability of the @xmath44 qso rx  j1834.1 + 5913 described above , no optical candidates for blazar activity were discovered in this manner .",
    "similar to the comparison with known blazars , we can examine how  compares to the egret pulsars . in figure  10",
    ", we compare the 0.12.4 kev x - ray flux ( becker & trmper 1997 ) and average flux @xmath81 mev for egret pulsars ( fierro 1995 ; kaspi  2000 ; ramanamurthy  1995 ) . any possible pulsar counterpart of  should be assigned an x - ray flux upper limit equal to the flux of the brightest unidentified source in the error ellipse .",
    "this role is therefore properly assigned to rx  j1836.2 + 5925 , although the fact that it is variable in x - rays already places some doubt upon its credentials as a pulsar candidate .",
    "most of the soft x - ray flux observed from intermediate - age neutron stars is surface thermal emission , which should not vary from year to year .",
    "however , the additional nonthermal x - ray component which is present in geminga and other @xmath0-ray pulsars could in principle vary , and halpern & wang ( 1997a ) suggested that it does in geminga .",
    "therefore , we use the quiescent flux upper limit of this source ( from the 1995  observation ) for comparison in figure  10 .",
    "such a comparison strains the analogy with geminga . while the latter is a cooling neutron star with @xmath83  k at @xmath84  pc ,  is about 50 times fainter in x - rays , thus either @xmath85  kpc , or if it is to be located at a similar distance as geminga , its surface temperature should be less than @xmath86  k. the larger distance is problematic , since it implies a @xmath0-ray luminosity of @xmath87  erg  s@xmath4 if isotropic , which is at least 5 times larger than the spin - down power of geminga , @xmath88  erg  s@xmath4 . alternatively , if it is closer than 1  kpc , then its surface must be cooler and it is likely to be older than @xmath86  yr , which would also strain its @xmath0-ray efficiency .",
    "if  is a pulsar but rx  j1836.2 + 5925 is _ not _ its counterpart , then its x - ray flux upper limit is reduced to @xmath89 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , or 80 times fainter than geminga .",
    "younger pulsars such as vela , psr  b1951 + 32 , and psr  b1706 - 44 are egret sources with luminosities in the range @xmath90  erg  s@xmath4 , but  lacks the nonthermal x - ray emission and synchrotron nebulae that accompany those more luminous pulsars",
    ". furthermore , it would be highly unexpected to find a pulsar of characteristic age @xmath91  yr at @xmath92  pc from the galactic plane . since this would require a kick velocity @xmath93  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "an interesting possibility would be a recycled millisecond pulsar , which could be old yet energetic .",
    "but even such pulsars manage to channel at least @xmath94 of their spin - down power into either thermal ( halpern & wang 1997b ) or nonthermal x - rays ( becker & trmper 1999 ; mineo et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the case of",
    ", any pulsar counterpart would have @xmath95 , which places a uniquely low limit on the ratio of x - ray to spin - down power .",
    "in addition to the well established classes of @xmath0-ray blazars and pulsars , several associations have been suggested which are highly plausible even while not conclusively proven .",
    "most notable is the radio star and be / x - ray binary lsi  @xmath96 ( strickman et al .",
    "1998 ) , long associated with the @xmath0-ray source 2cg  135 + 01 .",
    "similar objects might be the 47  ms pulsar b125963 with a be star companion , detected up to 200  kev ( grove et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the be / x - ray binary sax  j0635 + 0533 in the error circle of 2eg j0635 + 0521 ( kaaret et al .",
    "since these systems all have neutron stars with be star companions , their @xmath0-ray emission is not necessarily confined to the pulsar magnetospheric mechanism , but may arise in the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind with the wind of the companion , or with its radiation .",
    "however , all of these systems have bright optical companions , as well as strong x - ray emission at least at some of the time .",
    "it is estimated that there are only 200 be / x - ray binaries within 5  kpc ( rappaport & van den heuvel 1982 ) ; these are young systems which are confined to the galactic disk .",
    "if a be star binary , the location of  well away from the galactic plane would probably make it the nearest such system , and virtually impossible to miss since its @xmath16 magnitude would be brighter than 9 if at @xmath97  kpc . since no such be star is present in this region , this scenario for  can safely be ruled out .",
    "the statistical issues concerning the identification of egret sources with flat - spectrum radio sources were rigorously addressed by mattox et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and it is hardly possible to improve upon that analysis at this time . to summarize , flat - spectrum radio sources are the only agns that have been detected by egret with any degree of confidence . unfortunately , while the egret survey is flux limited , the radio identifications of egret sources in figure  9 are _ not _ flux limited , but rather are plagued by source confusion due to the large size of the egret error circles and the large surface density of radio sources . thus , the statistical reliability of egret source identifications is lower than that in any other branch of astronomy . as mattox et al .",
    "calculate , the radio sources that are reasonably secure ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath98 confidence ) identifications of egret sources have 5  ghz flux densities @xmath99  mjy .",
    "that is why the correlation between radio flux and @xmath0-ray flux in figure  9 is weak and less than linear . below 50  mjy",
    ", it is not even possible to make a meaningful argument for identification because the mean separation of such radio sources on the sky is comparable to the size of the egret error circles .",
    "accordingly , there are _ three _ radio sources within the error circle of 3eg  j1835 + 5918 , and they are all fainter than 4  mjy .",
    "none is an x - ray source . if any one of these radio sources were the true counterpart of the egret source , its ratio of radio to @xmath0-ray flux would be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of any known blazar .",
    "we are not claiming that 3eg  j1835 + 5918 is unique in this regard .",
    "other unidentified egret sources may eventually prove to be similar .    even though we can not yet point to a likely identification of",
    ", it is apparent from our multiwavelength observations that the true counterpart must be physically different or extreme in its properties relative to the classes of egret sources that have been identified so far .",
    "this is true whether the counterpart is one of the candidates studied here , or an undetected fainter object .",
    "furthermore , it is unlikely that a systematic error in @xmath0-ray position has caused us to overlook a more conventional identification . in radio and x - ray",
    "we have explored a region approximately 4 times the size of the 99% confidence location , and even within this ample area there are no blazar or pulsar candidates .",
    "for example , even if the counterpart were the brightest radio quasar in figure  1 , which is @xmath70 from the edge of the 99% confidence region , that object is a steep - spectrum radio source , as are all of the other bright radio sources outside the egret error ellipse .",
    "thus , an error of this magnitude in the location of will not change the basic conclusion that a new or extreme type of counterpart is responsible .",
    "one possible implication of this result is that radio - steep or radio - quiet quasars could be counterparts of some of the unidentified egret sources , despite the analysis of mattox  ( 1997 ) which argues that such a new population is not needed . instead of interpreting the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum and lack of variability as pulsar - like",
    ", it might be that these properties are also characteristic of the less violently variable agns .",
    "the obstacle to identifying a potential radio - weak or radio - quiet egret source population is not sensitivity , but source overlap .",
    "there are simply too many such agns in any egret error circle . while it is almost certainly the case that weaker radio blazars will be identified with high - energy @xmath0-ray sources once their error circles are reduced by _",
    "glast _ , it remains to be seen whether or not qualitatively different types of agn will be also be represented .",
    "an interesting scenario for a new type of @xmath0-ray agn has been suggested by ghisellini ( 1999 ) , who posits the existence of blazars whose synchrotron spectrum peaks in the mev band , and an inverse - compton component that peaks in the tev .",
    "a variation of such a model could fit the multiwavelength spectrum of the @xmath44 qso rx  j1834.1 + 5913 or any of the fainter qsos in the field provided that the proper index for the power - law electron energy distribution can be accommodated , and only if the observed optical emission is dominated by the usual thermal accretion - disk emission so that it can represent an upper limit to the underlying synchrotron power law .",
    "in such a model the hard x - ray emission is due entirely to the synchrotron component .",
    "the absence of a radio counterpart is naturally explained by the form of the power law , which in this case requires a flat spectral index @xmath100 where @xmath101 , thus the power - law index of the electron energy distribution is @xmath102 .",
    "such a prediction can easily be tested by more sensitive hard x - ray spectra of the qso rx  j1834.1 + 5913 .",
    "radio - quiet blazars have been hypothesized theoretically ( ghisellini 1999 ; mannheim 1993 ; schlickeiser 1984 ) but so far none have been identified ( stocke  1990 ; jannuzi  1993 ) , and it is not even clear what such a phenomenon would mean .",
    "could the multiwavelength properties of  be evidence of the hadronic model , the so called proton blazar ? such a theory proposes to explain @xmath0-ray emission in blazars , relying on protons accelerated by shocks moving through the jet .",
    "the accelerated protons then interact with soft - photons which lead to the creation of pions that further decay and cascade into electron - positron pairs , @xmath0-rays and neutrinos .",
    "such a model ( mannheim 1993 ) could fit the observations of  if the energy density ratio of protons to electrons is greater than 10 .",
    "if  is a pulsar , it implies that highly efficient ( or highly beamed ) @xmath0-ray pulsars can avoid producing soft x - rays at a level below @xmath5 of their apparent @xmath0-ray luminosity .",
    "at least two mechanisms of x - ray emission have been observed to accompany all @xmath0-ray pulsars at such levels or higher ( wang et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the outer - gap model ,",
    "synchrotron emission from secondary pairs that are produced by conversion of @xmath0-rays in the inner magnetosphere where @xmath103  g can explain the nonthermal x - ray component from pulsars like geminga and psr  b105552 .",
    "the second mechanism is thermal emission arising from the heated polar caps that are impacted by the inward - going accelerated particles from the outer - gap accelerator .",
    "there is good evidence that polar - cap heating occurs even in recycled pulsars which are _ not _ detectable egret sources ( zavlin & pavlov 1998 ; halpern & wang 1997b ) .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to reconcile such a theory , as well as the observational fact that pulsars are x - ray sources of @xmath104 , with a pulsar origin for .",
    "if many of the unidentified egret sources are similar radio - quiet pulsars in the galactic plane , x - ray absorption makes them exceedingly difficult to identify , and perhaps they will be revealed only when @xmath0-ray observations are sensitive enough to detect their pulsations independently .",
    "we identified all but one of the x - ray sources in the field of  to a flux limit of approximately @xmath2  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",
    "these are radio - quiet qsos [ @xmath105  mjy ] , coronal emitting stars , and a cluster of galaxies .",
    "there are no flat - spectrum radio sources in the vicinity to a flux limit of @xmath106  mjy , and no radio sources in the egret error ellipse brighter than 4  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "in addition , we find no evidence of a bl  lac object hosted in any low - redshift galaxy .",
    "we also found several qsos , as one would expect , using purely optical color selection .",
    "multiple - epoch optical imaging of the entire egret error ellipse has not revealed any notable variability .",
    "the discovery of only radio - quiet quasars in the error circle of  is a sobering development in the search for its identification . although the @xmath0-ray properties of  are more similar to those of geminga and other egret pulsars , no other indirect evidence for a pulsar , apart from one unidentified x - ray source ( rx  j1836.2 + 5925 ) whose optical counterpart is probably fainter than @xmath107 , and @xmath20 , has been found . yet",
    ", the fact that this x - ray source is variable by at least a factor of 2 would make it unique among rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "taken together , these findings point to the possibility of a truly remarkable object , one that can not be matched by any known class of @xmath0-ray source .    even in the absence of a definite identification ,",
    "it is clear that  is lacking in one or more of the physically essential attributes of any known class of @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "its radio flux is at least two orders of magnitude fainter than any of the securely identified egret blazars , and its soft x - ray flux is at least 50 times fainter than that of geminga and similar egret pulsars . if it is an agn it lacks the beamed radio emission of blazars .",
    "if it is an isolated neutron star , it lacks the steady thermal x - rays from a cooling surface and the magnetospheric non - thermal x - ray emission that is characteristic of all egret pulsars . if a pulsar , must be either older or more distant than geminga , and probably an even more efficient or highly beamed @xmath0-ray engine .",
    "we have plans to complete the optical spectroscopy of fainter candidates in this field to @xmath108 and we will also study fundamental properties such as polarization and optical variability of the newly discovered agns .",
    "perhaps the most important technique which we have not yet applied is polarimetry .",
    "polarimetry provides a definitive test for synchrotron emission in an ordered magnetic field , and polarization is one of the essential properties of blazars .",
    "perhaps the blazar nature of a radio - quiet beam in an agn can only be demonstrated in this way .",
    "a deeper radio pulsar search would also be warranted .",
    "finally , we will pursue the optical identification of the  source rx  j1836.2 + 5925 to the faintest magnitudes that are necessary in order to find our whether or not it is a neutron star . in combination , these observations may result in the identification of an important egret source , and possibly the prototype of a new class of @xmath0-ray emitter .",
