    "in many tokamak devices discharge scenarios are studied with the aim of improving the performance of future reactor experiments over the current design values .",
    "essentially two ingredients enter in the optimisation : the energy confinement time and the magneto - hydro - dynamic ( mhd ) stability limit , represented by a critical pressure . both energy confinement time and obtainable pressure",
    "are measured in current experiments and then for scaling purposes expressed in dimensionless parameters .",
    "the confinement improvement is given by the so - called @xmath3-factor which measures the energy confinement time ( @xmath7 ) relative to a scaling law ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the obtainable volume averaged pressure ( @xmath9 ) is expressed in the normalised quantity @xmath4 h = _ e / _ e , scaling _",
    "n = . [ definitions ] in the equations above @xmath10 is the volume average of @xmath11 measured in % , @xmath12 is the minor radius in m , @xmath13 is the magnetic field in t , and @xmath14 is the plasma current in ma . for the extrapolation one assumes a constant @xmath3-factor and then uses the confinement scaling to determine the confinement time in a next step device .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that the working point of the reactor is at the same normalised pressure @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath3-factors describe our imperfect knowledge of the scaling of confinement , i.e. the confinement in current day experiments in some areas of the parameter space scales differently than the developed scaling laws suggest .",
    "of course , the use of a constant @xmath3-factor is a daring approach to correct for this lack of knowledge , but nevertheless can give some idea of how confinement could be different in the next step experiment .",
    "different scenarios for improved performance have been proposed ( see for an overview @xcite ) .",
    "these scenarios include the internal transport barriers ( itb ) as well as the different scenarios for the improvement of the h - mode .",
    "the results presented in this paper can in principle be applied to all scenarios , but as examples only the h - mode scenarios will be shown the latter scenarios are an active area of research with many contributions from different machines , for instance , asdex upgrade @xcite , diii - d @xcite , jet @xcite , and jt60-u @xcite .",
    "( although the original reference @xcite refers to an internal transport barrier it was shown in a later paper @xcite that the ion temperature profiles follow the same scaling as those of the standard h - mode ) .",
    "an improvement in confinement or mhd stability would allow to operate the next step tokamak experiment iter @xcite at a higher energy multiplication factor @xmath15 , a higher fusion power , or a higher bootstrap current fraction .",
    "we define the energy multiplication factor @xmath15 and the fusion gain @xmath5 as q = p_fusion p_aux , g = p_fusion 5 p_heat [ qdef ] where @xmath1 is the total fusion power , @xmath16 is the externally applied heating power , and @xmath2 is the total heating power of the plasma , which in steady state is equal to the loss power @xmath17 . since one fifth of the fusion power heats the plasma , @xmath18 and there is a direct relation between @xmath5 and @xmath15 g = q q + 5 [ qrelation ] the currently proposed next - step experiment iter @xcite is designed to reach @xmath19 , and any realistic scenario to be tested in this experiment should reach a @xmath15 value significantly larger than one . scenarios at sufficiently large @xmath15 might be further optimised to reach a higher fusion power , or to reach a higher bootstrap current fraction .",
    "the latter optimisation is known as the hybrid scenario .",
    "it aims at the extention of the pulse length at similar performance as the design value .",
    "it is important for the results presented in this paper to stress that improvements in fusion power or bootstrap fraction can only be of interest if the the energy multiplication factor is sufficiently high . in the opinion of the authors a good representation of the extrapolated performance of current discharges towards iter",
    "can only be obtained if one of the figures of merit is directly connected with @xmath15 .",
    "other figures could be used to measure the bootstrap current and fusion power .",
    "although @xmath15 plays a central role in the iter experiment their is no published simple scaling that allows a direct assessment of the extrapolated value of current discharges . a simple way to obtain a rough estimate",
    "can be extremely useful in assessing the progress made in this large area of research .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that our extrapolation formula aims at judging the performance in iter and is not necessarily applicable for more general purposes .",
    "in particular we use a fixed size and magnetic field .",
    "a reactor design can also be optimised through changes in these parameters .",
    "the fusion power is proportional to p_fusion v p^2 , [ fusionpower ] where @xmath20 is the plasma temperature , @xmath21 is the plasma volume , and @xmath22 is the cross section for the fusion reactions averaged over the velocity distribution . over the temperature range of interest @xmath23 ,",
    "such that the fusion power scales with the pressure ( @xmath24 ) squared . the power loss from the plasma ( @xmath17 )",
    "is measured by the energy confinement time @xmath7 , and under stationary conditions it is balanced by the total heating power p_loss = w _ e = 3 p v 2 _ e = p_heat , [ ploss ] where @xmath25 is the stored energy . combining the eqs  ( [ qdef ] ) , ( [ fusionpower ] ) , ( [ ploss ] ) , and ( [ qrelation ] ) one obtains g = q q + 5 = p_fusion 5 p_heat n t _ e , [ nttaueq ] where @xmath26 was used , and @xmath27 is the plasma density .",

    "note that we can not assume @xmath17 to be constant , since discharges at different beta will extrapolate to a different fusion power and , hence , to different plasma heating powers . since for fixed magnetic field and plasma shape @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the safety factor at 95%of the plasma radius , and redefining the constant @xmath31 to include all constant design quantities one obtains _",
