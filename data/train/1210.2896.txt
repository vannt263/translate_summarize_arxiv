    "many semiconductor - based two dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems have an intrinsic valley degeneracy ( @xmath0 ) in addition to the spin degeneracy ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this valley degeneracy , which arises from the bulk band structure of the corresponding 3d material , is usually exact within the effective mass approximation , but is only approximate in the experimental 2d systems where there could be small energy level splittings between different valleys ( the so - called `` valley splitting'')@xcite .",
    "if the valley splitting is `` small '' in some operational sense , the 2d system could be considered to have a total quantum degeneracy of @xmath2 with both spin and valley states being quantum degenerate .",
    "a well known example of valley degeneracy is graphene , which has a valley degeneracy of @xmath3 with equivalent dirac cones at @xmath4 and @xmath5 points of the brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "examples of semiconductor - based 2d electron systems with valley degeneracy @xmath6 are si(100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 111 ) electron inversion layers in mosfets@xcite as well as alas- and alsb - based 2d electron systems@xcite .",
    "many other 2d systems ( e.g. n - gaas and p - gaas 2d electron and hole systems ) have no valley degeneracy ( @xmath7)@xcite . valley degeneracy obviously has a profound effect on the electronic properties of the 2d system . the purpose of the current paper is a systematic theoretical investigation of the valley degeneracy effect on 2d electronic transport properties , using si - mosfet structure based n - inversion layers as the specific system under consideration ( since these typically have @xmath8 ) although our qualitative and analytical results would apply to all 2d semiconductor systems ( specifically si - ge 2d electron systems ) with @xmath9 .    the valley - dependent electronic properties of a 2d ( or 3d for that matter ) semiconductor system is best understood by considering the electronic density of states in the valley - degenerate ground state , which is given for the 2d ( 3d ) system by : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath2 is the ground state degeneracy arising from both spin ( @xmath12 ) and valley ( @xmath0 ) degeneracies .",
    "the linear proportionality of the electronic density of states with the valley degeneracy leads immediately to the following dependences of the fermi wave vector ( @xmath13 ) , the thomas - fermi screening wave vector ( @xmath14 ) , and the fermi energy ( @xmath15 ) on the valley degeneracy in 2d and 3d systems :    @xmath16    since @xmath17 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath18 all depend nontrivially on the valley degeneracy factor @xmath0 , all electronic properties , including 2d transport properties , depend nontrivially on the valley degeneracy .",
    "we note that the valley - dependent transport properties are in general nontrivial since @xmath0 enters independently through both @xmath14 ( and hence screening ) and @xmath13 ( and hence scattering wave vector ) .",
    "increasing ( decreasing ) the valley degeneracy enhances ( suppresses ) screening through @xmath14 , but at the same time it also affects @xmath13 , increasing it with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "bulk si has six equivalent conduction band minima located about 85% to the brillouin zone boundary , thus making bulk si a @xmath19 system .",
    "each valley corresponds to an ellipsoid with anisotropic effective mass along and perpendicular to the symmetry axes .",
    "there are thus three possible si - based 2d electron systems , depending on whether ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , or ( 111 ) surface is used for creating the 2d confinement . within the effective mass approximation",
    "these three distinct 2d si systems have different valley degeneracies : @xmath3 [ si(100 ) ] , 4 [ si(110 ) ] , and 6 [ si(111 ) ] .",
    "uniaxial stress would lift the 4-fold or the 6-fold valley degeneracy of si(110 ) or ( 111 ) system , making ground state of each a doubly degenerate @xmath3 system similar to the si(100 ) system ( but , of course , with a distinct effective mass for each 2d system ) .",
    "it is important to mention in this context the fact that essentially all si - based 2d systems studied in the literature , independent of the surface orientation , have almost universally always experimentally manifested @xmath3 , even for si(110 ) and ( 111 ) systems , which nominally should have @xmath20 and 6 , respectively .",
    "this is thought to be due to extensive random uniaxial stress universally present at the si - sio@xmath21 interface in si mosfet structures , which pulls down two equivalent valleys compared with the other valleys , making both si(110 ) and si(111 ) mosfets to have doubly degenerate ground states ( @xmath3 ) similar to the si(100 ) mosfets ( but with different effective masses ) .",
    "an early experiment @xcite did manage to observe a six - fold valley degeneracy in si(111)- sio@xmath21 mosfets , but the system had very poor mobility and was not useful for the investigation of valley - dependent transport properties .",
    "other than this one exception @xcite , all si - sio@xmath21 2d mosfets invariably manifest @xmath3 ground state , independent of their surface orientation in sharp contrast to the effective mass approximation based expectation of @xmath19 ( 4 ) for si(111 ) [ ( 110 ) ] systems .",
    "an exciting new experimental development in the subject , which is the direct motivation for our study , is the recent fabrication of very high quality si(111)-on - vacuum 2deg fet structures @xcite , which exhibit @xmath19 ground state in agreement with the si bulk band structure effective mass approximation .",
    "presumably the very high quality ( without any interface strain ) of the si - vacuum interface , leading to very high mobility ( @xmath22 @xmath23/vs ) , produce the expected 6-fold valley degeneracy .",
    "the fact that these si - vacuum 2d fet systems also have very high mobility is consistent with the high quality of the si surface leading to the @xmath19 si(111 ) 2d system .",
    "the absence of a si - sio@xmath21 interface may be the reason that these new si - vacuum based 2d systems satisfy the expected @xmath19 effective mass approximation prediction .",
    "the absence of a real solid interface may simply enable the bulk effective mass approximation to be valid at the surface leading to the si(111 ) 6-fold degeneracy .",
    "although similar 2d systems on si(110)-vacuum system have not yet been made , it is reasonable to expect that the corresponding si(110 ) 2d system will have @xmath20 valley degeneracy .",
    "we note that these si - vacuum 2d systems manifest , in addition to the expected valley degeneracy anticipated on the basis of the effective mass approximation , also extremely high 2d mobilities because of the lack of random impurities in the oxide layer which adversely affects the mobility in the si - sio@xmath21 2d systems .",
    "in particular , of course , the effective mass approximation is not exact and breaks down at an interface@xcite .",
    "thus , even the double degeneracy ( @xmath3 ) of the si(100 ) 2d system [ or of the si(110 ) and ( 111 ) systems as observed experimentally ] is only approximate and is lifted beyond the simple effective mass approximation leading to small ( @xmath24mev ) energy splitting between the two valleys .",
    "one can , therefore , think about an experimental single valley 2d si system where this ground state valley splitting is large enough so that the higher valley state is not occupied by electrons",
    ". thus , in principle , the valley degeneracy of si - based 2d mosfet or inversion layer system for any surface orientation can be thought to be a continuous variable ranging between 1 and 6 depending on the microscopic details of the interface .",
    "this is the approach we take in the current work where @xmath0 is assumed to be a free parameters to be determined experimentally .    motivated by the above considerations , we theoretically consider valley dependent 2d transport in si systems assuming the valley degeneracy @xmath0 to be a free rational variable  in reality , of course",
    ", @xmath0 can only be 1 , 2 , 4 , or 6 in si 2d systems depending on the situation .",
    "( in some cases , where the valleys are occupied by unequal number of electrons because of small valley splittings , it may be useful to think of the valley degeneracy being a fractional number . )",
    "we address the density , the temperature , and the in - plane magnetic field dependence of 2d transport in the presence of a variable valley degeneracy .",
    "the applied in - plane magnetic field is parallel to the 2d system and is therefore assumed to only affect the spin degeneracy of the 2deg since it gives rise to a zeeman splitting between up / down spin levels .",
    "we find remarkably strong valley - dependence of 2d transport properties , and believe that the interesting physics of valley - dependent 2d transport should be investigated experimentally .",
    "the recently fabricated high - mobility si - vacuum 2d electron systems @xcite should be particularly suitable in this context .",
    "we organize the rest of this article as follows : in section ii we provide the detailed transport theory and a background giving a physical picture for why 2d carrier transport should depend strongly on the valley degeneracy , followed by the numerical results ( iii ) . in section",
    "iv we provide our calculated mobility for the recently fabricated extreme high - mobility si(111 ) 2d samples .",
    "we conclude in section v with a discussion .",
    "to calculate the density , temperature , and in - plane magnetic field dependence of 2d conductivity , @xmath25 , we use the drude - boltzmann semiclassical theory for 2d transport limited by screened charged impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "we assume that the 2d carrier conductivity is entirely limited by screened impurity scattering , where the disorder arises from randomly distributed charged impurities in a 2d plane located at the interface between si - sio@xmath21 ( or si - vacuum ) and random background charged impurity centers ( i.e. unintentional dopants ) in the 2d layer itself .",
    "we neglect all phonon scattering effects as well as surface roughness scattering . in the low temperature limit ( e.g. @xmath26 regime of interest to us )",
    "phonon scattering is negligible for 2d electrons in mosfet structures and the short - range surface roughness scattering at the si - sio@xmath21 interface is only important in the high - density limit ( @xmath27 ) ( the roughness scattering can be neglected in si - vacuum systems ) . at low carrier densities ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) and at low temperatures ( @xmath26 ) the 2d transport in si - mosfets",
    "is dominated by the long - range coulomb scattering by unintentional random charged impurities present at the si - insulator interface and background unintentional dopants inside si .",
    "the background impurity density is low ( @xmath30 ) , but it may dominate all other scattering in high mobility si - vacuum systems since the interface scattering is strongly suppressed due to the absence of the oxide layer .",

    "however , in the realistic si - mosfet systems quasi-2d quantum form factor effects arising from the finite width of the 2d layer in @xmath49-direction must be included in @xmath58 and @xmath56 .",
    "for this purpose the usual howard - fang variational function @xcite is used in our numerical calculations .",
    "we will show that the quantum form factor effects are of considerable quantitative importance especially at low densities , where the system can not really be thought of as an almost zero - width 2d layer .    using 2d rpa screening function at @xmath39 we have the scattering time for charged impurity centers @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is a 2d thomas - fermi wave vector with effective bohr radius @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the background dielectric constant ) , and @xmath64 is given by @xmath65q_0 \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm for } \\;\\ ; q_0\\ll1 , \\nonumber \\\\      & \\approx & \\frac{\\pi}{2q_0 ^ 2 } \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm for } \\;\\ ; q_0 \\gg 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus in the strong screening limit ( or @xmath66 ) we have @xmath67 , and the conductivity becomes @xmath68 , i.e. , the conductivity increases quadratically with @xmath0 . in the opposite limit ( i.e. weak screening limit ,",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] we show our numerical results ( based on the theory given in section ii ) for the low - temperature mobility ( defined simply as the conductivity divided by @xmath145 , @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the carrier density and @xmath148 is the electron charge ) of the si(111 ) 2d system , both for @xmath3 and 6 , as functions of temperature and density for several different impurity configurations .",
    "the density dependence agrees very well with the unpublished work of kane@xcite , and shows that the disorder in this new batch of si(111)-vacuum samples is approaching the @xmath149 limit which is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the usual si 2d samples@xcite , thus explaining the very high mobilities of these new 2d systems .",
    "our results also demonstrate that the strong screening by the @xmath19 si(111 ) system , compared with the @xmath3 system , would lead to much stronger temperature dependence of the conductivity or the mobility , thus providing a clear means to distinguish the valley degeneracy .",
    "our calculated density dependence of the mobility is approximately consistent with the recent measurements@xcite .",
    "is shown ( a ) for @xmath3 and ( b ) for @xmath19 .",
    "the black dashed lines represent the results with only 3d bulk impurities with @xmath150 , and other three lines represent results with only 2d impurities ( no bulk impurities ) : @xmath151 with @xmath152 , @xmath153 with @xmath154 , and @xmath155  with @xmath156 .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) show the calculated mobility with only 3d bulk charged impurities as a function of density for different temperatures @xmath157 , 0.5 , 0.8 , and 1.1 k ( from top to bottom ) . in ( c ) @xmath3 and the bulk 3d impurities of density @xmath158 are used . in ( d ) @xmath19 and the bulk 3d impurities of density @xmath159 are used .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ]    based on these calculation we can approximately estimate @xcite the expected activation energy of the @xmath160 fractional quantum hall state of the si(111 ) 2d system ( in these high - mobility samples ) to be @xmath161 using the zhang - das sarma model@xcite ( and subtracting out the level broadening effect @xcite using our calculated mobility ) .",
    "the observation of the fractional quantum hall effect in si(111 ) 2d system here is only possible because of the incredibly high mobilities achieved through hydrogen passivation , and it is indeed a materials science breakthrough .",
    "the main purpose of this article is a systematic theoretical investigation of the valley degeneracy effect on 2d electronic transport properties in si - mosfet systems .",
    "we calculate theoretically charged - impurity scattering - limited 2d electronic transport in si(100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 111 ) inversion layers at low temperatures and carrier densities , where screened charged impurity scattering is important .",
    "the 2d mobility for a given system increases quadratically with increasing valley degeneracy , @xmath162 , in the strong screening limit ( @xmath163 ) for the same impurity configuration .",
    "we also show that the temperature and the parallel magnetic field dependence of the 2d conductivity is strongly enhanced by increasing the valley degeneracy .",
    "all our results are valid only at carrier densities above which localization effects become important , but we estimate that the transition to the insulating state occurs well below @xmath164 @xmath29 density in the high mobility systems of our interest @xcite in the current work .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing our findings in both si - sio@xmath21 and si - vacuum mosfets . the parallel magnetic field and the temperature dependence of the resistivity ( at zero parallel field ) manifest strong valley dependence regardless of impurity configurations . for @xmath7 both @xmath136 and @xmath139",
    "show weak temperature and magnetic field dependence by virtue of weak screening , and for @xmath19 due to strong screening ( i.e. large @xmath163 ) the resistivity shows both strong temperature and magnetic field dependence .",
    "our finding of remarkably strong valley - dependence of 2d transport properties in si - mosfets and the interesting physics of valley - dependent 2d transport should be investigated experimentally .",
    "similar strong valley degeneracy dependence is also apparent in the many - body effects of 2d systems , which have been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have also provided detailed calculations for the valley - dependent transport properties of 2d si(111 ) systems as a function of temperature and density in very high - mobility low - disorder samples , commenting on the possible activation energy for the fractional quantum hall effect in such ultraclean si system .",
