    "there is a growing interest in studying artificial agents - interacting models which are able to generate global behaviors found in social , biological and economical systems  @xcite .",
    "examples such as matching games  @xcite and ideal gas models of trading markets  @xcite show that this approach commonly used by physicists can be nicely applied to problems lay outside the discipline .",
    "one exciting fact is that these artificial models , although contain simple governing rules , can still generate non - trivial global cooperative behaviors  @xcite . in these self - organized complex systems",
    ", agents can reach equilibrium states through adaptation , a dynamical learning process initiated by the feedback mechanism present in these systems .",
    "people possesses _ inertia _ when making decisions and switching strategies in economical systems .",
    "conceptually , this inertia is similar to the one used by newton to describe the body motions in the physical world .",
    "it refers to how reluctant a person is going to drop his / her current economics plan and look for another one , just like an object is reluctant to change its motion state .",
    "inertia may originate from : ( 1 )  the cost needed to change strategies , ( 2 )  the low sensitivity towards a change in environment and ( 3 )  the loss - aversion behavior in human  @xcite  people loves to fight back from loss  @xcite . like",
    "different bodies may have different mass in classical physical systems , different people may carry different inertia in economical markets . in this paper , we introduce a simple model to study the idea of inertia .",
    "this model gives striking improvement of cooperative behavior , such as removal of maladaptation  @xcite and dynamically increase of diversity among agents , without any necessity to alter initial conditions and payoff mechanism .",
    "actually , studies of a few variants of mg also show improvement in cooperations  @xcite .",
    "we shall further discuss their results and compare with ours in section  [ s : previous ] after finished reporting our model and results .",
    "our model is a modification of a famous econophysical model known as mg , proposed by challet and zhang in 1997  @xcite .",
    "mg is a simple game model that captures the minority seeking behavior found in stock markets and resources competitions .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview of econophysics and mg . ) in mg , @xmath0 agents struggle to choose between two options repetitively , either buy ( 0 ) or sell ( 1 ) in each turn . those who have chosen the minority sides are winners at that turn and are awarded @xmath1 dollar , otherwise they lose @xmath1 dollar .",
    "the only information they received is the history of the game , which is a binary bit string composed of the minority choices of previous @xmath2 turns .",
    "a strategy is a map from the set of all possible histories to the set of two options .",
    "if a strategy predicts the minority correctly , it is added @xmath1 virtual score point , otherwise it loses @xmath1 virtual score point .",
    "each agent is assigned @xmath3 strategies once and for all at the beginning of the game in order to aid his / her decision . in standard mg",
    ", an agent makes decision based on his / her best current strategy at hand , namely , the one with the highest virtual score .",
    "clearly , there are @xmath4 possible histories and hence @xmath5 available strategies",
    ". however , out of the whole strategy space , only @xmath6 of them are significantly different .",
    "the diversity of the population is measured by @xmath7 , which is equal to @xmath8 .",
    "the smaller the @xmath7 , the more similar are the strategies hold by agents . up",
    "to first order approximation , the dynamics of mg is determined by this control parameter @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    the most sparkling macroscopic observable in mg is perhaps the variance of option attendance per agents @xmath9 .",
    "it represents the wastage of the system and fluctuation of resources allocation ; the smaller @xmath9 , the more the whole population benefits .",
    "researchers found that @xmath9 falls below the value that all agents make their choices randomly in a certain range of @xmath7 .",
    "this indicates that agents are cooperating although they are independent and selfish .",
    "more importantly , there is a phase transition at the critical point @xmath10 which divides the @xmath9 against @xmath7 curve into the so - called symmetric phase ( @xmath11 ) and asymmetric phase ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "to incorporate inertia into mg , we introduce a new modification  hypothesis testing minority game ( hmg ) .",
    "hypothesis testing is a standard statistical tool to test whether an effect emerged from an independent variable appears by chance or luck . in the standard version of mg ,",
    "the best strategy is defined as the strategy with the highest virtual score . in hmg",
    ", however , an agent @xmath13 determines his / her own best strategies by testing the following null hypothesis @xmath14 : the current strategy @xmath15 performs better than the other strategy @xmath16 available to agent @xmath13 .",
    "note that we have restricted ourselves to the simplest case @xmath17 , but the model can be easily extended to @xmath18 cases under the same formalism .",
    "this agent possesses an sustain level @xmath19 on his / her current strategy @xmath15 , which is the same as the confidence level on the validity of the null hypothesis we commonly use in hypothesis testing ( that is , the acceptance area of a standard normal ) .",
    "this @xmath20 defines how much he / she could sustain the under - performance of @xmath15 and thereby represents his / her inertia .",
    "the @xmath14 of a particular agent @xmath13 can be quantitatively written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the virtual score of a particular strategy @xmath24 at @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the number of time steps counted from his / her adoption of @xmath15 for that individual agent .",
    "the dominator @xmath26 represents the fluctuation of strategies performance the agent perceived .",
    "an agent @xmath13 would continue to stick on his / her current strategy @xmath15 until @xmath23 descends outside his / her sustain level .",
    "then he / she has to admit that @xmath14 is not likely to be true , rejects it and shift to the other strategy . after a change of strategy ,",
    "the virtual scores of both strategies are reset to @xmath27 and @xmath25 is set back to @xmath1 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath20 , the milder his / her response and the more reluctant for him / her in shifting strategies . in this way",
    ", @xmath20 plays the role of inertia of an agent in this game .",
    "agents with @xmath28 would be most similar to standard mg agent , they employ strategy with the highest virtual score .",
    "however , there are still two differences : these hmg agents would still stick on current strategy in case of a tie in virtual scores , and the virtual scores will be reseted after shifts in strategies .",
    "we remark that randomness are involved in only three places in hmg , namely , ( 1 )  the initial assignment of strategies and inertia ; ( 2 )  the choice of a new strategy in case of a tie in the virtual scores of the alternative strategies when a player has decided to drop the current one ; as well as ( 3 )  the determination of the winning side in case of a tie .",
    "thus , the dynamics of hmg is deterministic when played by an odd number of agents each carrying @xmath29 strategies .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical simulation on our model . with the presence of inertia among agents , every agent needs a longer time to make up his / her mind and the equilibration time in hmg",
    "is lengthened .",
    "we take the value of @xmath30 every 1,000 time steps and regard the system as having equilibrated if the percentage difference of successive measurement is smaller than @xmath31 . upon equilibration , we take our measurement by recording the dynamics of the next 25,000 time steps .",
    "furthermore , we repeat this data taking procedure 150 times , each with an independent set of initial conditions .    in a population where everyone tries to cling on the minority side as long as possible",
    ", agents may have different inertia @xmath20 , and some may have no inertia at all ( standard mg agents ) .",
    "we first study the behavior of hmg when every agent has the same @xmath20 .",
    "( we shall move on to study the mixed population case in later sections . )",
    "we begin our study by determining the value of @xmath26 , a perception of agents on the fluctuation of virtual score difference between two strategies .",

    "[ f : tmg ] shows a plot of the variance of attendance for a particular option @xmath9 against the control parameter @xmath7 for different inertia @xmath34 , with @xmath26 set to @xmath35 . there is a huge drop of @xmath9",

    "[ f : tmg_ac ] ) . not just the maladaptation in symmetric phase is greatly reduced , but the cooperation between agents is also improved in the asymmetric phase for certain values of @xmath34 .",
    "the reduction of system wastage in the asymmetric phase ( @xmath36 ) is believed to be resulted by increasing stickiness of agents on current strategies and elongating their observing time .",
    "this leads to an increase of frozen agents ( see fig .  [",

    "however , things become more complicated when @xmath37 . from now on , this article will focus on the striking improvement of cooperation in the symmetric phase .",
    "the removal of maladaptation in this region is directly related to the disappearance of periodic dynamics that normally present in the standard mg . the periodic dynamics is a result of oversampling of strategy space and common zero initial conditions among agents when @xmath37 , accounting for the high volatility in the symmetric phase .",
    "it is reflected in a prominent period @xmath6 peak in the autocorrelation of the attendance time series of a particular option @xcite .",
    "[ f : tmg_corr ] shows an evidence of this postulate : as shown from the autocorrelation function , periodic dynamics appears in the case @xmath34 = 0.53 which has high @xmath9 in figs .",

    "what is the critical limit of @xmath34 in order to remove the maladaptation ? to answer this , we have to look closely into the periodic dynamics that governs the maladaptation in the symmetric phase .",
    "earlier study stated that virtual scores of strategies are likely to reset to @xmath27 every @xmath6 number of steps through the periodic dynamics in the symmetric phase .",
    "initially all strategies have @xmath27 score point , whenever a strategy @xmath39 wins a bet in a particular @xmath40 , most agents would rush to @xmath39 which is @xmath29 score points ahead its anti - correlated partner @xmath41 in the next appearance of @xmath40 .",
    "it is likely that they would lose due to this overcrowding . in this manner ,",
    "the virtual scores of all strategies are reset at this stage .",
    "this loop repeats with interval @xmath6 and leads to the large fluctuation of option attendance in the symmetric phase .",
    "@xcite    therefore , the question becomes when this reset and oscillate mechanism will disappear .",
    "actually , the periodic dynamics is destroyed when agents are no longer sensitive enough to immediately shift to a strategy standing out after winning a bet .",
    "the criteria for this situation to occur is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ e : condition ] ) . if the value of @xmath34 satisfies the inequality  ( [ tmg_limit ] ) , agents would no longer be constrained by the periodic dynamics every @xmath6 steps .",
    "then , a re - recognizing process will draw in . in the standard",
    "mg , all identical strategies have same virtual scores throughout the game . however , in hmg agents would clear all virtual scores after changing strategies .",
    "this move is done in multifarious time steps for different agents , depending on the combination of strategies in their hands .",
    "hence , the scores of identical strategies eventually diverges if they are hold by different agents , and these strategies may be employed again in multifarious time in the future .",
    "the net effect of this re - recognizing process is diversifying strategies in the population intrinsically . in this way",
    ", both the oversampling and overcrowding found in the symmetric phase are relaxed , lowering the volatility .",
    "for instance , when @xmath2 = 5 , the limit @xmath44 equals @xmath45 ; that is , @xmath46 .",
    "this criteria is confirmed in figs .",
    "[ f : tmg_ac ] and  [ f : tmg_corr ]  all cases that show no periodic dynamics satisfies eq .",
    "( [ tmg_limit ] ) and have low variances .",
    "note that for the cases where @xmath34 does not exceed this limit , their correlation signals are much stronger than that of the standard mg ( see fig .  [",
    "f : tmg_corr]b ) .",
    "it is because the dynamics of hmg is more deterministic than that of the standard mg as hmg agents will continue to stick on current strategy when facing a tie in strategy virtual scores , which happens during a reset .",
    "that means their actions repeat during this reset and the system path is more likely to repeat , resulting in stronger correlation .",
    "this is like removing the random dice in standard mg when facing a tie in virtual scores , a periodic signal as strong as this case is also obtained .",
    "actually , the movement of the virtual score difference between two strategies is not likely to perform random walk .",
    "another possible way in perceiving @xmath26 is to put it as the actual standard deviation of this difference in runtime , which represents a more realistic market scenario .",
    "that is , @xmath47    the results are very similar to the previous case , which are shown in figs .",
    "[ f : varhmg][f : varhmg_corr ]",
    ". however , the critical value of @xmath34 for the system to escape from the grip of periodic dynamics appears to be higher . remind that the virtual score difference of two strategies performs random walk with following step sizes and probabilities @xmath48 : @xmath49 meanwhile , the presence of periodic dynamics ensure a reset every @xmath6 number of time steps . we can approximately calculate the average variance by considering all possible traveling paths , which equals @xmath50 ( detail mathematics is shown in the appendix ) . for instance , when @xmath2 = 5 , the critical value for the periodic dynamics to disappear is @xmath51 ; that is , @xmath52 .",
    "this value of @xmath34 is consistent with the data presented in figs .",
    "[ f : varhmg_ac ] and  [ f : varhmg_corr ] .",
    "again , we believe that after the breaking of periodic dynamics , the re - recognizing process mentioned in the previous section comes in and diversifies the strategy space , resulting in a drop of fluctuation .     against the system complexity @xmath7 for @xmath34 equals ( a ) 0.55 , ( b ) 0.6 and ( c ) 0.9 , with @xmath26 given by eq .",

    "it is already clear that a pure population of agents having inertia reduces system wastage .",
    "now it is instructive to study whether these agents ( sticky agents ) is advantageous over standard mg agents ( sensitive agents ) in a mixed population .    ,",
    "sensitive agents @xmath54 and the whole population @xmath55 against the fraction of sticky agents @xmath56 in the mixed race .",

    "the sensitive agents are believed to be tightened by the periodic dynamics , making them to keep on losing . on the other hand ,",
    "sticky agents are likely to win more frequently as they are resistant to follow the oscillation .",
    "note that the whole population also benefits from adding in more sticky agents ( see the triangles in fig .",
    "[ f : mix ] ) .",
    "when @xmath56 is increased up to about @xmath59 , @xmath54 starts to rise .",

    "the reduction of the volatility by modifying the rules or the initial conditions of the standard mg is not a new idea in the field , especially for the symmetric phase .",
    "a few previous studies have shown results quite similar to that of the hmg . here",
    ", we would like to first give a short review of these works and to compare them with our study .",
    "cavagna _ et al .",
    "_ proposed the thermal minority game ( tmg )  @xcite , which adds stochasticity into the standard mg . in tmg , an agent does not employ the strategy with highest virtual score strict a way , rather he / she would use a strategy with probability calculated according to its virtual score and a fixed inverse temperature @xmath60 . in other words ,",
    "the employment of strategies by agents become probabilistic with the degree of stochasticity depending on @xmath60 .",
    "they found that for certain range of @xmath60 , the volatility in the game is reduced in most range of the control parameter @xmath7 .",
    "that is , in both symmetric phase and asymmetric phases , tmg succeeds in raising the degree of cooperation between agents by introducing noises into the decision process of strategy selection for individual agents .    in search of the continuous time dynamics of tmg , garrahan _ et al .",
    "_ confirm by numerical simulation that the dynamics in the symmetric phase of mg is sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "in particular , they reported that the volatility would drop far from the original value if random initial conditions to strategies ( with @xmath61 initial virtual scores for a population of 100 agents ) are assigned at the beginning of the game .",
    "@xcite      in searching the replica solution and the nash equilibrium for the symmetric phase of the standard mg , challet _ et al .",
    "_ found that the nash equilibrium is not unique and agents at these equilibria use pure strategies ( that is , they either always choose @xmath1 or always choose @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xcite in nash equilibrium , agents perform much better than in the standard mg , the volatility is greatly suppressed in the symmetric phase .",
    "challet _ et al . _",
    "try to let the agents consider their own impact on the market during the evaluations of all strategies available to them .",
    "that is , the virtual score of a strategy is proportional to the cumulated payoff the agent would have received had he or she always played the strategy . although the difference between this evaluation of virtual score and the original one is believed to be small ( @xmath62 ) , the volatility is found to be far lower than the original mg .",
    "this difference is not negligible because of finite size effect and the high degree of over - sampling of the strategy space when @xmath37 .",
    "however , this setting is computational intensive and unrealistic , as people in real market usually can only obtain information on his / her own current wealth and unlikely to try out all strategies .",
    "@xcite      in batch minority game , the virtual score of a particular strategy is updated as discrete accumulated effect of order @xmath0 iterations in the standard mg model , whereas the mg having the original updating method can be viewed as a `` online '' minority game in the neural network sense . after adding in stochasticity , initial evaluations and generalizing these game to continuous time limit , coolen s group has extensively written out the analytical solutions of these two versions of mg .",
    "they found that in symmetric phase their theory pointed at the existence of a critical value for the initial strategy valuations above the system would revert to a state with vanishing volatility .",
    "@xcite      wong _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out in  @xcite that the maladaptation observed in the symmetric phase in the standard mg is originated from the fact that initial virtual scores of all strategies are the same .",
    "they then studied the effect of introducing diversity @xmath63 into the game , where @xmath64 is the range of randomly assigned initial scores to strategies at the beginning of the game and @xmath0 is the number of agents .",
    "they found that by increasing the diversity , the maladaptive behaviour observed in the symmetric phase @xmath65 is reduced and hence the cooperation among agents is promoted .      from the above studies",
    ", we can conclude that the volatility would suppressed under following conditions : ( 1 )  randomly allocating initial strategy score over a critical value , ( 2 )  adding in noise or stochasticity in choosing a strategy , ( 3 )  assigning pure strategy or ( 4 )  taking an agent s impact on market into account when evaluating all strategies .",
    "firstly , we would like to stress that the main focus in this article is to provide a simple formalism to incorporate inertia into a multi - agent system such as mg , as well as recording its influence to the dynamics of the game . in hmg",
    ", there is no prior preference in strategies for they have the same initial virtual score . unlike the standard mg ,",
    "soon after the commencement of hmg , the preference of a strategy is determined by both the virtual score differences between strategies at hand and inertia @xmath66 of agent @xmath13 . through the presence of inertia",
    ", each agent will gradually develop their own preference in strategies through dynamical adaptation . in this respect , even though the presence of inertia may eventually lead to difference views of an identical strategy between agents , this is achieved by an adaptive process through the dynamics of the system but not by artificially assigning a spread of initial virtual scores .",
    "this is a marked difference between hmg and the works of wong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , garrahan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite as well as coolen _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the spreading of initial virtual scores of strategies would only leads to a drop of volatility in the symmetric phase , but not the asymmetric phase . in hmg , however , there is a global improvement in both phases for certain value of @xmath34 .",
    "we believed the tmg presents results most similar to our game .",
    "in both case , the degree of cooperation are raised in most range of @xmath7 . however , as mentioned previously , tmg achieve this by adding stochasticity and noise into agents choice of best strategies .",
    "meanwhile , in hmg agents are deterministic when choosing their best strategies : they stick to their current strategy until it is outperform to certain threshold , this does not involve any stochasticity .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of hmg is deterministic when played by an odd number of agents each carrying @xmath29 strategies .",
    "lastly , we think that using pure strategies and taking agents themselves into account when evaluating all their strategies are impractical and unrealistic situations .",
    "our model provide a natural , realistic way to prompt cooperation , meanwhile demonstrating the effect of stickiness when people moving around investment strategies .",
    "we have successfully introduced the concept of inertia into the minority game , which shows a remarkable improvement of cooperation among agents in most range of @xmath7 , especially in the symmetric phase @xmath67 .",
    "we also compare our findings with a few variants of mg reported in the literature .",
    "we calculated the critical values of inertia needed to uplift the cooperation behaviors , which depends on how agents perceive the fluctuation of virtual score difference between strategies .",
    "this reduction of sensitivity among agents is found to be useful in removing maladaptation due to over - reaction .",
    "in contrast , if every action is smooth and all agents response to information in no time , they will suffer from a overcrowd loss easily .",
    "meanwhile , agents carrying stickiness seems to perform much better than sensitive agents .",
    "our findings suggest that inertia ( or stickiness ) is crucial and beneficial to a society .",
    "it is hoped that the role of inertia will be investigated in more detail based on our model hmg , such as the effect of giving a diversifying range of inertia to a population .",

    "<S> we consider a model that demonstrates the crucial role of inertia and stickiness in multi - agent systems , based on the minority game ( mg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inertia of an agent is introduced into the game model by allowing agents to apply hypothesis testing when choosing their best strategies , thereby reducing their reactivity towards changes in the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we find by extensive numerical simulations that our game shows a remarkable improvement of global cooperation throughout the whole phase space . in other words , the maladaptation behavior due to over - reaction of agents </S>",
    "<S> is removed . </S>",
    "<S> these agents are also shown to be advantageous over the standard ones , which are sometimes too sensitive to attain a fair success rate . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate analytically the minimum amount of inertia needed to achieve the above improvement . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation is consistent with the numerical simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we review some related works in the field that show similar behaviors and compare them to our work . </S>"
