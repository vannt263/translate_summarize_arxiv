    "ever since its initial discovery in the signals received from radio pulsars , interstellar scattering and scintillation has proved to be a useful tool in radio astronomy ( see rickett 1990 , 2001 ; narayan 1993 ; hewish 1993 for reviews ) .",
    "it provides unique information on small - scale turbulent fluctuations in the ionized interstellar medium ( e.g. , armstrong , cordes & rickett 1981 ; wilkinson , narayan & spencer 1994 ) and on the sizes of compact radio sources .",
    "the latter application has contributed to progress in several areas of astrophysics : radio pulsars ( e.g. , roberts & ables 1982 ; cordes , weisberg & boriakoff 1983 ; wolszczan & cordes 1987 ; gwinn et al .",
    "1997 ) , intra - day variables ( e.g. , rickett et al . 1995 , 2001 ; lovell et al . 2003 ) and gamma - ray burst afterglows ( e.g. , goodman 1997 ; frail et al . 1997 ; taylor et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the fundamental quantity in scintillation theory is the correlation of flux variations of a distant source observed at two positions separated by transverse distance @xmath0 on the observer plane .",
    "since each flux is the square of the local electric field , the quantity of interest is a fourth order correlation of the electric field ( see eq .",
    "[ gamma4def ] ) . to interpret scintillation data , we need to calculate the expectation value of this fourth moment as a function of the strength of the turbulent fluctuations in the scattering medium , the shape and size of the radio source , the observing frequency , etc .",
    "the scattering of radio waves in the interstellar medium may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters ( eq . [ pwrsf ] ) : @xmath1 which measures the strength of the scattering , and @xmath2 which describes the power spectrum of the fluctuations .",
    "the turbulence in the interstellar medium appears to be well - described by a kolmogorov scaling , which corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the scattering medium along any line of sight is determined by just @xmath1 ; however , @xmath1 varies from one direction to another , and also with frequency in a given direction ( see eq . [ ulambda ] ) .",
    "analytical results are available for the flux correlation function in the limit of both very weak scattering ( @xmath4 ) and very strong scattering ( @xmath5 ) ( e.g. , goodman & narayan , 1995 ; rickett 1990 ; and references therein ) . in the latter regime ,",
    "the scintillation is known to occur on two very different scales , determined by diffractive and refractive effects .",
    "while a great deal of interesting work on interstellar scintillation has been done using asymptotic results , many observations correspond to the difficult intermediate regime where @xmath1 is neither @xmath6 nor @xmath7 ; no analytical results are available in this transition regime . for typical high lines of sight through the interstellar medium at high galactic latitudes , the transition regime occurs at radio frequencies @xmath8 ghz , a frequency of much interest for both intra - day variables and gamma - ray burst afterglows ( but less so for pulsars which , because of their steep radio spectra , are usually observed at lower frequencies where asymptotic strong scattering results apply ) .",
    "some very approximate formulae have been proposed for the transition regime ( e.g. , walker 1998 ) . however , for accurate results",
    ", one has to resort to numerical computations of the scintillation correlation function , which is technically challenging and has been rarely attempted .",
    "we describe in this paper numerical computations of the scintillation correlation function for a wide range of values of the scattering parameter @xmath1 , spatial separation @xmath0 , source size @xmath9 ( defined in eqs .",
    "[ gaussian][rsdef ] ) and frequency difference @xmath10 ( defined in eq .",
    "[ etadef ] ) . using the numerical results",
    "we have developed a fitting function for the flux correlation that is valid for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "the function asymptotes to the appropriate analytical results in the limits @xmath11 ( very weak scattering ) and @xmath5 ( very strong scattering ) and agrees well with numerical results in the transition regime in between .    in  [ sec : screen ]",
    "we introduce the basic fourth order moment of interest to flux scintillation observations , and in  [ sec : numerical ] we explain how we numerically compute this quantity . in  [ sec : fitting ] we present our fitting formula , which agrees well with the numerical results .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : summary ] with a brief summary .",
    "we present in appendices [ appa]-[appc ] technical details , including some asymptotic results useful as checks of our fitting functions , and a discussion of parabolic arcs in secondary spectra .",
    "in the thin - screen approximation , one imagines that the turbulence affecting radio - wave propagation is concentrated in a narrow layer perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "this is sometimes not far from the truth , although it would usually be more accurate to assume a number of scattering screens ; but the opposite limit of homogeneously distributed turbulence is probably the exception rather than the rule .",
    "the observer lies in a parallel plane at distance @xmath12 from the screen , and the source is behind the screen at distance @xmath13 from it .",
    "waves propagate freely from the source to the screen , where they suffer a phase shift @xmath14 that depends upon the two - dimensional position @xmath15 within the screen , and thence travel freely again to the observer s plane .",
    "the distortion of the phase fronts at the screen leads to modulations of the flux on the observer s plane , through a combination of refractive focusing and diffractive interference .",
    "it is useful to define an _ effective distance _",
    "@xmath16 from observer to screen .",
    "this allows us to analyze the problem as if the source were infinitely distant and the wavefronts were planar before encountering the screen .",
    "we follow the notation of goodman & narayan ( 1989 , henceforth gn89 ) , who discuss the mutual coherence function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electric field due to a source of unit strength measured at vector position @xmath19 on the observer s plane ( a plane perpendicular to the line of sight to the source ) at radio frequency @xmath20 . as written above",

    ", we are interested in flux correlations rather than visibilities , so we set @xmath25 . positions @xmath26 and @xmath19 then represent two positions at which the flux is measured .",
    "the measurements may be done by two telescopes simultaneously , or by the same telescope at different times . in the latter case , the interstellar turbulence responsible for phase changes in @xmath27 is assumed `` frozen '' on timescales of interest , so that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the effective transverse velocity of the line of sight through the interstellar medium .",
    "the angle brackets denote an ensemble average over realizations of the turbulence .",

    "however , approximate analytic expressions can be obtained in the limits @xmath45 ( weak scattering ) and @xmath46 ( strong scattering ) , and these are given in appendix b. they are useful to check the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the integral ( [ wdef ] ) , and also to guide the choice of functional form for the fitting functions presented in  4 .",
    "the integral ( [ wtdef ] ) for the flux cross spectrum @xmath42 proved to be challenging to estimate accurately over the full ranges of @xmath1 , @xmath47 , and @xmath10 required .",
    "it is two - dimensional and extends to infinity .",
    "worse , it is only conditionally convergent since @xmath48 as @xmath49 . and the regions of the @xmath50 plane that dominate the integral vary with the scattering regime .",

    "a branch cut must be drawn from each point .",
    "unless @xmath64 is integral , these cuts must extend to infinity rather than join the branch points to one another .",

    ", we wrote the code in c , although that language has only recently supported complex arithmetic .",
    "recent versions of the gnu gcc compiler and mathematical library functions performed very reliably and were almost as convenient to use as their fortran counterparts .",
    "a typical contour of integration is shown in figure  [ contourfig ] .",
    "integration starts from @xmath69 , since the complete integral ( [ contour_int ] ) is twice its righthand half , but at @xmath70 , since there is no singularity to pin the contour to the origin .",
    "the contour is drawn adaptively , differentiating the argument of the exponential at each step to determine the direction in which its real part becomes negative most rapidly and its imaginary part is constant , until a branch cut is encountered .",
    "the contour then follows the lefthand side of the cut downward to the branch point , circumnavigates it , and then continues by steepest descent .",
    "special care must be taken when @xmath47 is small since there can be near - cancellation between the contributions from the cuts at @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; this is handled by applying a romberg quadrature scheme to the sum of the integrands at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "care must also be taken when @xmath75 because the terms of @xmath76 nearly cancel ; this is handled by expanding @xmath76 in powers of @xmath77 .",
    "the numerical estimate of ( [ contour_int ] ) becomes the integrand for integration over @xmath53 .",
    "this integrand decreases exponentially at large @xmath53 because the branch points of the inner integral move far from the real axis where their contribution is suppressed by @xmath78 .",
    "we use a straightforward midpoint quadrature along the real axis in the auxiliary variable @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a scale chosen according to the values of @xmath47 and @xmath1 . as is well known , numerical quadratures of smooth functions over infinite or periodic domains with schemes that use uniform steps and weights , such as midpoint or simpson s rule , converge faster than any power of stepsize .",
    "so there is no point in using a higher - order method for the outer integral .",
    "the present method for evaluating @xmath81 is efficient for moderate to large values of @xmath1 and @xmath47 because the @xmath52 integrand decreases rapidly along the steepest - descent path , but it has difficulty with very small @xmath82 .",
    "fortunately , the analytic weak - scattering approximation is then very accurate , so the code uses that approximation when @xmath83 .",
    "one test of the code is that the numerical results match smoothly onto the analytic ones in the weak - scattering regime .",
    "we have tested the code also against the asymptotic results of the previous section for strong scattering , @xmath5 .",
    "and we have tested it against an old code valid only for @xmath43 that uses a completely different strategy ( based on integrating @xmath50 in polar rather than cartesian coordinates ; see goodman & narayan 1985 ) .",
    "after tabulating @xmath84 for given values of @xmath1 and @xmath10 , we obtain the flux correlation function @xmath85 by numerical calculation of the hankel transform @xmath86 where @xmath85 and @xmath87 depend on the absolute values of @xmath19 and @xmath51 only .",
    "( this would not be true of the spectrum of phase fluctuations on the scattering screen were anisotropic . ) equation ( [ hankel ] ) is for a point source . in the general case , when the source observed at position @xmath88 has a circularly symmetric normalized intensity profile @xmath89 with root mean square size @xmath90 and that observed at position @xmath91 has profile @xmath92 with size @xmath93 , the flux correlation function becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the hankel transforms of the source profiles : @xmath97 in this paper , we consider two different source profiles , gaussian and tophat .",

    "in developing a fitting function for the correlation @xmath108 in equation ( [ finitesource ] ) , we have found that it is not necessary to consider the dependence of @xmath40 on the two sources sizes @xmath90 and @xmath93 independently .",

    "the particular function described in  [ weakscatt ] and  [ strongscatt ] could doubtless be improved , but it appears to fit the numerical results adequately over the entire parameter range of interest .",
    "we provide in  4 of this paper a fitting function for a fairly general correlation , @xmath124 , that describes the statistics of flux scintillations of compact radio sources .",
    "the function has been optimized for two source shapes , gaussian and tophat ; the latter may be appropriate for gamma - ray burst afterglows ( sari 1998 ) .",
    "we also allow for different source sizes and observation frequencies for the two flux measurements being correlated , which may again be useful for interpreting afterglow observations .",
    "we have not specifically allowed for the finite integration time or finite bandwidth over which each flux measurement is made .",
    "finite integration time causes any given flux correlation to correspond not to a single value of @xmath0 but to a range of values , i.e. , @xmath124 is smeared in @xmath0 by a convolution .",
    "similarly , finite bandwidth leads to smearing in @xmath10 .",
    "these effects can be modeled by convolving the fitting function with the appropriate broadening functions in @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , they could be incorporated directly into the fitting function itself through additional factors ( we have not attempted this here ) . in practice , with current technological limits ,",
    "finite bandwidth is unlikely to be important in the regimes of weak or moderate scattering ( @xmath184  a few ) .",
    "the results we have presented are for a single thin scattering screen .",
    "this is probably a reasonable model since the scattering regions in the interstellar medium tends to be clumpy .",
    "therefore , the scattering is dominated by one or at most a few distinct screens .",
    "the model is also specific to a kolmogorov spectrum of fluctuations in the scattering medium .",
    "this again is not unreasonable ( e.g. , armstrong et al . 1981 ) , although boldyrev & gwinn ( 2003 ) have recently challenged the usual assumption , which we have adopted , that the statistics of these fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "the most serious simplifying assumption in this work is that we have taken the scattering to be isotropic , so that the scintillation correlation function depends on separation @xmath0 but not on the particular direction of @xmath0 transverse to the line - of - sight . a number of observations ( e.g. , wilkinson et al .",
    "1994 ; dennett - thorpe & de bruyn 2003 ; and references therein ) have shown that the scattering irregularities in the interstellar medium are anisotropic , presumably because blobs are elongated parallel to the local magnetic field",

    "the delta function must be discarded since @xmath47 is large . when the remainder is used in ( [ s2def ] ) to calculate the secondary spectrum , the exponential in @xmath344 can be replaced by unity if @xmath345 because the complex exponential will then effectively limit @xmath10 to small values : @xmath346.\\ ] ] the parabolic arcs can now be recognized in the arguments of these delta functions , which are softened but not suppressed by the final integration over the transverse wavenumber : @xmath347 here @xmath348 as before , and the heaviside function keeps the argument of the square root positive .",
    "the heaviside function cuts off the power abruptly for @xmath349 , and the inverse square root concentrates power just inside this cutoff . both observations and numerical simulations confirm this general behavior @xcite , and this is the origin of the arcs .",
    "plausibly the arcs would be more prominent if the electron - density spectrum were anisotropic with stronger scattering along @xmath328 than along @xmath329 , because the integration ( [ s2p ] ) would have less of a smearing effect .",
    "presumably also , arcs should be more prominent when scattering is dominated by a thin `` screen '' rather than distributed along the line of sight , since integration over @xmath68 would further soften the final square root in eq .",

    "these points are made by @xcite .    in strong scattering ( @xmath5 ) , the conditions for validity of the final result ( [ s2final ] ) include not only eq .  ( [ fnulim ] ) but",
    "also @xmath350 so that the integration over @xmath50 is dominated by @xmath272",
    ". however , the same result obtains in weak scattering as well provided @xmath351 , since the same @xmath352 term appears in eq .",
    "( [ wtref ] ) and gives rise to delta functions in the @xmath353 transform of the 2d cross spectrum .",
    "in fact , regardless of the magnitude of the scintillation parameter @xmath1 , it appears that the arcs are due to weak large - angle scattering by inhomogeneities smaller than those that are responsible for the main part of the scatter - broadened image @xcite ."
