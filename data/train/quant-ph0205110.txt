    "the ideas of zero range potential ( zrp ) approach were recently developed to widen limits of the traditional treatment @xcite , the author accounts higher momentum partial amplitudes @xcite for a multi - center problem .",

    "as it is known , if we diminish the range and at the same time increase the depth of a pertinent spherically symmetrical potential then the only characteristic parameter of a potential may remain fixed ( usually it s a scattering length or a position of the bound - state energy level ) , others characteristic are lost .",
