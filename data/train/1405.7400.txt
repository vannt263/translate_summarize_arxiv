    "the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) by the first stars and quasars was likely a complex process .",
    "current evidence from observations of polarization of the cosmic microwave background implies a redshift for reionization of @xmath16 @xcite , while tracers at lower redshift suggest that the tail end of the process was still ongoing at redshifts @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) offer one of the most promising probes of this epoch due to their bright afterglows , which can be seen at cosmological distances and lack some of the complications of quasar observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this _ letter _ , we present our gemini spectrum of the afterglow of the long - duration grb  140515a . it reveals a sharp decrement in flux shortward of @xmath188900 , implying a redshift of @xmath19@xmath206.32 @xcite , which we refine below .",
    "this makes grb  140515a  the burst with the third largest spectroscopic redshift . only grbs 080913 ( @xmath19=6.733 ; @xcite ) and 090423 ( @xmath19@xmath208.23 ; @xcite ) are known to be more distant , although grb  090429b has a photometric redshift of @xmath189.4 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that at the time of our gemini observations , no optical observations or photometric redshift estimates had been reported in the gcn circulars , so the high-@xmath19 nature of the burst was purely serendipitous .",
    "we describe our spectroscopic observations in section 2 and analyze the spectrum to set constraints on the opacity of the igm at @xmath21 in section 3 .",
    "we fit the red damping wing of ly@xmath0  with three fiducial models in section 4 to set limits on the neutral fraction of the igm .",
    "we conclude in section 5 by placing these observations in the context of other constraints on reionization .",
    "grb  140515a  was detected by _",
    "swift _ at 09:12:36 ut on 2014 may 15 @xcite .",
    "we initiated followup observations with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the 8  m gemini - north telescope at 10:48 ut and discovered a faint optical source consistent with the x - ray afterglow position @xcite in our @xmath22 and @xmath19 acquisition images @xcite .",
    "we obtained a dithered pair of 900  s spectra starting at 11:42 ut on 2015 may 15 ( 2.5  hr after the bat trigger ; @xcite ) . during the observations , the source position increased in airmass from 2.38 to 3.00 .",
    "we oriented the 1@xmath23-wide slit at a position angle of 78@xmath243 , which was within 5@xmath25 of the parallactic angle , so differential slit losses should be minimal .",
    "we used the r400 grating with an og515 filter to cover the wavelength range 588810162   .",
    "the gmos focal plane has three abutting ccds and we were only able to obtain observations with a single grating angle , so our data have two gaps at 72757298    and 87098737   .",
    "in addition to the high airmass , the moon was @xmath2699% illuminated , so the sky background was extremely high .",
    "fortunately , the seeing was exceptional , with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 0@xmath2745 in the acquisition images @xcite and even in our final spectrum , the spatial fwhm of the object trace was only 0@xmath276 .",
    "the spectral fwhm of night sky emission lines are @xmath187   , but due to the excellent seeing , the object did not fill the slit and the resolution of the object spectrum is @xmath185  ",
    ".    we use iraf to perform basic two - dimensional image processing , remove cosmic rays @xcite , and shift and stack the two - dimensional frames prior to spectral extraction .",
    "we apply flux calibrations and correct for telluric absorption using our own idl procedures and archival observations of standard stars taken with a similar setup .",
    "the airmass of our data was substantially higher than any suitable standard star observations that we are able to locate in the gemini archive , so the overall spectral shape of the final spectrum is somewhat uncertain , although this does not affect any of our analysis .",
    "in addition , we are careful to manually scale the correction for telluric h@xmath28o absorption near 9400    because of the large airmass difference with the available standards .",
    "we also correct the spectrum for @xmath29  mag of galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "the final extracted spectrum is shown in figure  [ specfig ] .",
    "the sharp decrement in flux shortward of 8910    is evidence of ly@xmath0  absorption at @xmath1 .",
    "we fit a power law to the continuum flux at 90209870   , while excluding the region of the most uncertain telluric correction near 9400    and find a best fit of @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 , which is shown as the solid green line .",
    "the value for the slope has additional uncertainty due to low - level telluric absorption over most of the available continuum .",
    "we search the afterglow continuum for narrow absorption features from the host galaxy interstellar medium but find no plausible matches at wavelengths compatible with the approximate redshift of ly@xmath0 , so we are unable to make a precise measurement of the redshift of grb  140515a  ( @xmath33 ) , a point that we will return to below .",
    "instead , we find unresolved absorption lines at 8985.2 , 9000.0 , and 9697.9    that are consistent with the @xmath34 1548 , 1551 doublet and @xmath351670 from an intervening absorber at @xmath36 .",
    "a possible weak absorption feature at 9170.4   , with an observed - frame equivalent width ( @xmath37 ) of 2.1@xmath50.8   , does not match any other expected line from the absorber or the host galaxy3@xmath275 away from the grb afterglow .",

    "no strong absorption lines from that galaxy are expected in our limited continuum wavelength interval . ] .",
    "we first examine the transparency of the igm to ly@xmath0  photons over the redshift range @xmath38 . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of these data ( peaking in the continuum at @xmath1820 per 1.38    pixel near 9000   ) are not as high as for grb 130606a @xcite or for typical high-@xmath19 quasar observations but still place meaningful constraints .",
    "we inspect the sky - subtracted two - dimensional spectra and find no clear transmitted continuum over the wavelength range 81858905    ( corresponding to redshifts of 5.7336.325 relative to ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "we follow @xcite and define an effective optical depth to ly@xmath0 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the average transmission relative to the continuum in a bin . to compare to previously reported results from @xmath17 quasars and grb 130606a ,",

    "[ nhfig ] , we show the distribution of available @xmath14  measurements for @xmath19@xmath264 grbs ( mostly compiled by @xcite ) .",
    "it is striking that the four highest - redshift grbs include the three lowest values for @xmath14  in the sample .",
    "lower neutral hydrogen column densities imply a higher escape fraction .",
    "an anderson - darling k - sample test gives a probability of 1.8% that the distribution of column densities at @xmath46 comes from the same distribution as that at lower redshift .",
    "the redshift cut was not made blindly , so more data are needed to test whether the neutral hydrogen column distribution evolves to lower values at higher redshift .",
    "one concern is selection biases , particularly that sightlines with higher columns will potentially be associated with more dust extinction and thus less likely to have afterglows identified and spectra taken with adequate s / n , but it is not clear how much of a differential effect this could be between the @xmath47 and @xmath17 samples .    this result may be consistent with recent observations of a decreasing fraction of ly@xmath0-emitters among lyman - break galaxies at @xmath48 , which have also been modeled in terms of an increase in escape fraction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although an increase in the neutral hydrogen fraction ( @xmath10 ) of the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) is an alternative hypothesis .",
    "these are complementary observations , as grbs are superior tracers of star formation at high redshift compared to flux - limited samples of galaxies @xcite .",
    "our non - detection of narrow absorption lines from the host galaxy may be simply a consequence of the low neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "some of the strongest lines we expect in the limited wavelength interval of our continuum are @xmath351260 , @xmath351302 , and @xmath351334 .",
    "we use the noise in the spectrum to estimate conservative 3@xmath12 upper limits on the observed - frame ews of these lines of 1   , 2.5   , and 2.5   , respectively . assuming the optically - thin limit and the measured value of @xmath14 , these correspond to upper limits on the gas - phase abundances of [ z / h]@xmath11@xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively @xcite .",
    "if the igm contributes to the neutral hydrogen column , these limits would have to be relaxed .",
    "nevertheless , they are compatible with typical sub - solar abundance estimates for high-@xmath19 grb host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and we do not require unusually low abundances to explain the lack of detected absorption lines from the host .",
    "our second model ignores the likelihood of an absorber associated with the host galaxy and embeds a `` naked '' grb in a uniform medium of constant @xmath10 .",
    "we use the model of @xcite to approximate the effects of a partially neutral igm .",
    "the model requires a lower redshift bound for neutral hydrogen absorption , which we fix to @xmath19=6.0 because it has no effect on the results , and an upper redshift bound that we assume is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the best fit is shown as the red dot - dashed line in figure  [ specfig ] and has @xmath33=6.3282@xmath52 and @xmath10=0.056@xmath53 . at the 3@xmath12 level ,",
    "the maximum value allowed for @xmath10  is 0.09 .",
    "the two models above represent possible extremes of absorption from only the host or igm . if both are present , the situation is more complex",
    ". if we simply combine the models , the limits will relax and favor somewhat smaller values for @xmath10  and @xmath14  as the two sources of opacity are both allowed to contribute . however , more properly treating the inhomogeneity of the igm during of the end of reionization will considerably relax these constraints @xcite .",
    "we address this issue by fitting a hybrid model with absorption from both the host and the igm .",
    "this model has three free parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath10 , and @xmath33 ) .",
    "we place the grb in an ionized bubble and fix the radius of the bubble along our sightline to @xmath54=10 comoving mpc .",
    "this choice is motivated by the simulations of @xcite , who found regions of approximately this scale when @xmath10  was globally equal to 0.5 .",

    "the marginalized contours from our fit are shown in figure  [ igmfig ] . as expected ,",
    "this significantly relaxes the constraint on @xmath10 . even with the favorable assumption about the existence of an ionized bubble , @xmath10@xmath550.21 at the 2@xmath12 level .",
    "we do not take into account the effect of inhomogeneity on the expected shape of the damping wing from the igm @xcite .",
    "a larger bubble size would formally allow for even higher @xmath10 , but such bubbles are rare unless @xmath10  is low @xcite .",
    "smaller ionized bubbles would only tighten this constraint .",
    "the three fiducial models sample the range of variation of plausible reionization scenarios .",
    "all three models provide acceptable fits to the data , with reduced-@xmath56 values near 1.0 , although the igm - only model appears to be less adequate at the sharp edge of ly@xmath0 .",
    "the patchiness of the end of reionization will result in significant stochasticity along different sightlines @xcite and a statistical ensemble of grb sightlines will be necessary to measure cosmic variance and jointly constrain the models in more detail .",
    "we have presented an optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb  140515aat @xmath1 and used it to provide constraints on the opacity and ionization state of the igm .",
    "this is now the fourth high-@xmath19 grb for which a damping - wing analysis has been performed .",
    "@xcite found that for grb 050904 at @xmath19=6.295 @xcite , @xmath57 at the 95% confidence level , but that the high host hydrogen column density inhibited tight constraints .",
    "@xcite examined the same spectrum and argued that proper treatment of inhomogeneity will relax the constraint even further .",
    "@xcite were unable to place meaningful constraints on the sightline to the @xmath19=6.733 grb 080913 due to the low s / n of the data , but quoted @xmath58 at the 90% confidence level .",

    "set a 2@xmath12 upper limit of @xmath10@xmath550.11 for a model with igm absorption extending up to @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite argued that their spectra of the same burst disfavored a pure host - galaxy absorption model .",
    "if they allowed igm absorption at redshifts up to @xmath33 , they found @xmath10=0.086@xmath59 . lowering the upper redshift to @xmath19=5.83 allowed values for @xmath10  up to @xmath180.5 .",
    "however , their claims are based on a subtle 0.6% deviation from the pure host - galaxy model .",
    "quasars are the other major observational probe of the ionization state of the igm at these redshifts , but variations in intrinsic properties and difficulties in modeling quasar near zones make the interpretation more controversial ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "models with smaller or nonexistent regions will prefer even smaller values for @xmath10 .",

    "the reasonable quality of the constraint on @xmath10  from these data despite the short integration time is a result of the brightness of the afterglow and the low hydrogen column density of the host . a future sample of grbs at even higher redshift ,",
