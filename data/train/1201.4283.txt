    "various states of matter we know today are characterized by interactions and symmetry of their microscopic building blocks . local order",
    "is reflected in mesoscopic quantities , such as the phase of electromagnetic waves , crystalline order , nematic director , magnetization , dielectric tensor and others .",
    "we call these quantities order parameters . a prominent example of partially ordered matter are liquid crystals , which are characterized by orientational order and liquid - like positional freedom of the molecules .",
    "nematic liquid crystals exhibit topologically prescribed defects , which in combination with surface - treated colloidal particles @xcite , nanoparticles or general confinement @xcite , enable creation of complex materials with tunable optical response @xcite .",
    "the nematic order can be represented with an order parameter tensor that contains both the magnitude of the ordering and the directional information @xcite . in studies of defect topology ,",
    "the principal eigenvector of this tensor , the director , is a common choice to represent the average direction of molecular alignment .",
    "vectors with unit size lie on a sphere ( @xmath0 ) , which is a topologically nontrivial space .",
    "consequently , boundary conditions can exist that can not be smoothly interpolated in bulk without introducing defects @xcite .",
    "in contrast to heisenberg ferromagnets , which have the ground state manifold with exact topology of a sphere , nematic liquid crystals have an additional rule that opposite vectors represent the same state , as the molecules have no back - front distinction @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this property is that beside the point defects , nematics also allow line defects . beside that , the sign of the vector field representing the director is ambiguous and therefore the same holds for the invariants of the field which are odd in the director , such as the topological charge of point defects @xcite .",
    "the growing interest for controlled formation of complex defect structures in constrained nematic liquid crystals @xcite is increasing the demand for visualization and simple classification of complex nematic director fields .",
    "this stimulated us to derive a natural expression for the topological charge that does not involve integration and reflects its discrete nature .",
    "we accomplish this by decomposing the director field into a hierarchy of geometric primitives , which enables intuitive understanding of the topological charge based on the qualitative features of the director field .",
    "we extend the classification from strictly topological to a more general one that has the advantage of differentiating topologically equivalent states with different energies .",
    "we introduce a quantity called the defect rank and draw parallels with the topological charge and naming conventions for point defects .",
    "if the vector heads are artificially prescribed , the director field @xmath1 becomes a proper vector field .",
    "volumes of interest , such as those that include defects , can then be classified using the topological charge , which enumerates the defects with the elements of the second homotopic group @xcite . as topological properties are invariant to the specific shape of the surface that encloses the test volume ,",
    "a spherical volume is assumed from here on without the loss of generality . for a sphere , parametrized by the spherical angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the gauss integral for the topological charge @xcite reduces to the following expression , @xmath4     geometric decomposition of a surface texture on a sphere .",
    "( a ) any texture can be smoothly deformed to make the director perpendicular to the sphere everywhere except in narrow transition zones .",
    "this decomposes the surface into patches with perpendicular director , boundary loops with parallel director and point - like grains with the director rotating in - plane for half a turn .",
    "the inset shows the continuous texture of a grain .",
    "( b ) grains contribute @xmath5 to the topological charge , depending on the sense of the director rotation .",
    "the table shows four possibilities , together with corresponding @xmath6 parameters that define the director s orientation in patches , boundaries and grains , respectively .",
    "( c ) merging and dividing of patches by continuous transformations preserves the topology of the texture .",
    "the change in the number of patches is compensated by spontaneous creation of grains . ]",
    "this expression involves integration over all the details of the director field @xmath1 , which can be eliminated , if the director @xmath1 on the enclosing sphere ( the surface texture ) is decomposed into geometric primitives , over which the integration can be performed in advance . according to the component of @xmath1 along the surface normal , the sphere can be split into patches of outgoing vector field and patches of ingoing vector field .",
    "these patches are separated by a disjoint set of closed loops ( boundaries ) where the director lies tangentially to the enclosing sphere . on the boundaries ,",
    "the director still has one degree of freedom ",
    "its direction in the tangent plane . with the same approach as for the patches ,",
    "the boundary can be split into parts with a constant orientation along the normal to the boundary curve .",
    "these are separated by points ( grains ) , where @xmath1 is directed tangentially along the boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "degenerate cases , such as textures with touching boundaries or wide areas where director is parallel to the surface , can always be regularized by an infinitesimal perturbation of the director field .",
    "the parametrization of the sphere with the polar angle @xmath2 and the azimuth @xmath3 generates a local coordinate frame @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 lie parallel to the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) . within this",
    "coordinate frame , we introduce local spherical coordinates with angles @xmath10 and @xmath11 to express the director @xmath1 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 simplifies the calculation for director fields with reversed vectors . without the loss of generality , each angle can vary in only one of the directions : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    to calculate the contributions of patches , boundaries and grains to the topological charge ( eq .  [ eq : qdef ] ) , a model for @xmath16 and @xmath17 is needed . on every patch",
    ", the director @xmath1 can be combed perpendicularly to the surface without changing the topology , because the condition for the normal component to have a constant sign locally restricts the ground states to a half - sphere , which is topologically trivial ( contractible to a point ) .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath18 so that the director points directly outwards if @xmath19 and inwards if @xmath20 . for a single patch , shaped like a spherical cap bounded by a circle of constant latitude at @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) , the contribution to the topological charge follows , @xmath22 this contribution is proportional to the fraction of the sphere covered by the patch and its sign depends on whether the director points inwards or outwards from the surface , which is given by the signature @xmath13 .    on the boundary",
    ", the director makes a smooth turn from outward to inward direction .",
    "a boundary without grains is modeled by setting @xmath23 and choosing @xmath10 to do a half - turn within a narrow transition zone between the boundary and the patch , @xmath24 @xmath25 is the half - width of the transition zone around the boundary , and the boundary signature @xmath26 selects the in - plane orientation of the director at the boundary , @xmath27 ( fig .  [ fig : fig1]a ) . to simplify the calculation , the width @xmath25 of the transition zone is limited to zero , @xmath28",
    "the result does not depend on @xmath29 , therefore the orientation of the director on the boundary does not influence the topological charge .",
    "the contribution of a single grain is obtained in a similar fashion . the reverse of the in - plane orientation of the director is smoothly interpolated by @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being the half width of the transition in @xmath9 direction ( fig  [ fig : fig1]a , inset ) .",
    "parameter @xmath32 governs in which way the director points at the grain , @xmath33 .",
    "a limit @xmath34 yields the contribution of the grain .",
    "boundaries divide the texture into patches with arbitrary positioning , shape and hierarchical nesting order .",
    "if the texture is instead viewed as a superposition of layers , the boundaries can be counted together with patches . in such decomposition",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    consider a texture , divided by @xmath37 boundaries into @xmath38 patches of arbitrary shapes .",
    "every boundary can have an even number of grains , since the continuity requires an even number of director flips on a closed circuit .",
    "the topological charge @xmath39 of the entire texture then splits into a sum of elementary contributions ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qp],[eq : qb],[eq : qg ] ) ) , @xmath40 instead of adding patch contributions @xmath41 , which are proportional to the areas of the patches , multiplied by the signature @xmath42 ( eq .  [ eq : qp ] ) , we start with a uniform background sphere and progressively build the desired configuration . for convenience , we choose the background with the director pointing outwards , @xmath19 .",
    "to recover the desired configuration , @xmath37 patches must be added .",
    "each patch contribution is counted twice , once to cancel out the background and once to account for its own contribution . this way , all the patches are shaped as spherical caps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) and their contributions can be grouped with their respective boundaries , @xmath43 the background patch @xmath44 has the topological charge of a radial hedgehog , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the euler characteristic of the surface @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the polar angle @xmath2 has disappeared , since the shape and position of the boundaries are not topologically relevant .",
    "any number of boundaries can be nested one inside another , which results in patches with alternating @xmath42 being added to the sphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .    the grain contribution @xmath47",
    "can be associated with geometric features of the texture .",
    "the director @xmath1 rotates around the surface normal as we move along the boundary .",
    "there are two possible directions in which we can trace the boundary , but they are invariantly distinguishable , as there are patches of opposite signatures on each side . for a choice of the direction that has the positive signature patch on its left side ,",
    "the grain contribution is @xmath48 if the director rotates anticlockwise and @xmath49 otherwise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "the charge decomposition in the form @xmath50 applies not only to the nematic director , but to any medium that can be described with a unit vector order parameter .",
    "it works for spherical enclosing surfaces , with possible generalization to surfaces of arbitrary genus .",
    "we assumed the vector field on the enclosing surface is non - singular .",
    "singular objects , like boojums and other surface defects , contribute additional terms to the expression @xcite .",
    "patches , boundaries and grains are two- , one- and zero - dimensional geometric features of the surface texture .",
    "this decomposition is similar to the notion of domain walls and defect lines in ferromagnetic systems @xcite , except in our case we observe 2d texture on a closed surface instead of bulk 3d field .",
    "our boundaries are similar to cross sections of magnetic nel walls and the grains correspond to cross sections of bloch lines .",
    "however , in magnetic systems , the domain walls and lines naturally prefer narrow transition zones @xcite , whereas in nematics narrow transition zones are merely a computational tool .",
    "one of the reasons for calculating the topological invariants is to detect similarity between director fields .",
    "take two surfaces that enclose closed volumes in the bulk .",
    "if we cut out the volumes and exchange them , we can only reconnect them smoothly with the ambient director field if they are topologically equivalent .",
    "topological charge tests for compatibility of bulk volumes of the medium judging only by the director on their surfaces , so the charge can be assigned to the surface texture itself .",
    "compatibility of two surface textures neither implies additivity of the topological charge hidden inside nor the invariance to the choice of the enclosing surface .",
    "we are free to add further restrictions and thus refine the classification .    despite the topological equivalence of two volumes",
    ", the transition between them may not be possible due to the energy constraints , which depend on the medium and the choice of the enclosing surfaces .",
    "the structures can be deemed equivalent if one can be transformed smoothly into the other without deviating significantly from the local free energy minimum ( if there is a transformation that avoids major free energy barriers ) .",
    "the deformation part of the free energy is related to the spatial derivatives of the director .",
    "a general transformation can both deform the shape of the medium and independently rotate the director locally . however , if the director is treated like it is pinned to the underlying coordinate space and rotates with it , the neighborhood of each point stays approximately the same , except for the anisotropic distortions , which can be considered small . by allowing only the subset of all smooth deformations that obey this rule ,",
    "topologically equivalent states with different energies can be differentiated . in topology",
    ", such mappings are called push - forward mappings .",
    "this type of restriction is more natural for solids , where the underlying space corresponds to the crystal lattice .",
    "we can argue that two structures are similar if we could deform one into the other if they were elastic solids .",
    "the surface texture decomposition involves expressing the director in a coordinate frame aligned to the surface ( eq .  [ eq : npar ] ) . under a mapping that satisfies the restriction to push - forward transformations",
    ", the local coordinate system retains its relative position to the director and the decomposition does not change .",
    "the texture decomposition is therefore a property that classifies the surface textures into classes , where the representatives of the same class can be stitched together without significant change in free energy .",
    "the topological charge , which can be computed from the decomposition ( eq .  [ eq : qfinal ] ) , is only part of the information included in the full decomposition .",
    "other invariants , like the relative position of the boundaries and their boundary signatures @xmath51 , which have no effect on the topology , are also good for classification of the qualitative shape of the texture . in the following section",
    "we show that these quasi - invariants are relevant for nematics , where traditional topological charge is problematic due to the additional symmetries of the director .",
    "topological charge ( eq .  [ eq : qdef ] ) has an odd parity under inversion of the director @xmath52 .",
    "the additivity of the topological charge , which holds for true unit vector fields , may be violated because nematics allow line defects with half - integer winding number .",
    "these defects can not be represented as a vector field without explicitly introducing a branch discontinuity where the vectors flip sign . in the presence of line defects ,",
    "the topological charge of each individual point defect can be flipped just by bringing it across a branch discontinuity , without changing its physical shape @xcite .",
    "the topological charge of a cluster of point defects can not be determined from the individually measured charges of constituent point defects . instead , only even or odd parity of the topological charge is properly defined and conserved @xcite .    despite ambiguity ,",
    "the signs of topological charge are usually assigned by convention .",
    "the charge @xmath53 is assigned to all radial hedgehogs and @xmath54 to hyperbolic hedgehogs , regardless the orientation of the arrows on vectors , even though there is a 3d rotation in director space that can transform one into the other @xcite . in case the hedgehogs interact in the same medium , the continuity of the director field prescribes their relative signs of topological charge that may clash with this convention .",
    "the transformation from a hyperbolic to radial hedgehog involves a rotation of the director without simultaneous rotation of the underlying space .",
    "such transformation does not satisfy our condition to push - forward transformations and the incompatibility of the surface textures means they can not exist in the same surrounding director field without costly elastic deformations .",
    "the transition between the hedgehogs is thus restricted by an energy barrier , except in cases where the experiment is specifically designed to support the transition @xcite .",

    "the definition of the defect rank @xmath55 can be made consistent with the conventions if we find a matching integer expression involving the surface texture properties .",
    "earlier ( eq .  [ eq : alfass ] ) we introduced the boundary signature @xmath26 that describes how the director behaves on the boundary .",
    "the boundary signature @xmath56 corresponds to the director stream lines that touch the boundary from the outside of the sphere ( fig .",

    "this property is replicated by the defect rank , if we define it as @xmath59 if the surface has grains in its texture , the defect rank @xmath55 is not defined .",
    "the textures with grains can be understood as intermediate states through which the texture must pass in order to change its defect rank . for the defect rank to be a useful parameter , such intermediate states must have a higher energy , although the energy constraints are not absolutely prohibiting , like topological are .",

    "the latter should not even be assigned a sign when used in a description of a single defect structure , while the defect rank spans an entire integer range without ambiguities .",
    "this contrasts with the ferromagnetic case , which is fully described by the topological charge and does not require description with the defect rank .",
