    "in metals , enhanced paramagnetism is often observed as a large temperature - dependent paramagnetic susceptibility .",
    "various compounds @xcite as well as elemental metals @xcite have been reported to exhibit such intriguing behavior , motivating significant theoretical efforts towards developing understanding of these phenomena , leading to theoretical models such as self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) @xcite and other theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , the scr models have recently been applied to antiferromagnetic doped cuprates @xcite and itinerant magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the underlying context of these theories is the proximity to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "it has been recently predicted that dilute impurities , such as co , in a nearly ferromagnetic host , such as platinum ( pt ) , could serve as a test case for the behavior of magnetic droplets in the vicinity of a qcp @xcite .",
    "pt is an enhanced paramagnet that has magnetic properties unlike noble metals such as au , ag , or cu .",
    "instead , it is closely related to pd .",
    "pt has a strong electron exchange interaction that results in an enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility @xmath6 that is temperature dependent , exhibiting curie - weiss ( cw ) behaviour above @xmath9 k and saturation or possibly a weak maximum below this [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : squid](b ) ] , features shared with pd and other nearly ferromagnetic metals . the origin of the cw @xmath6 is still controversial .",
    "one line of theoretical explanation holds that it is purely a band structure effect related to the strongly energy dependent density of electronic states at the fermi level , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "another explanation relies on the importance of spin fluctuations @xcite , while a third gives priority to the electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "the low temperature saturation ( or peak ) in @xmath6 has also been debated extensively and may be explained in each of the above pictures . in the context of nearly ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "pt is less magnetic than pd , with susceptibility nearly an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "also , unlike pd , relativistic effects are important in its electronic structure @xcite .    here",
    "we report @xmath11li beta - detected nuclear magnetic resonance ( @xmath0nmr ) and relaxation rate measurements in pt .",
    "the @xmath0nmr technique gives us the unique opportunity to explore several aspects of the implantation of a spin polarized radioactive @xmath1li@xmath2 ion in pt .",
    "one question is whether the @xmath1li will locally perturb the pt host or whether it acts as a passive probe revealing the intrinsic properties of the host .",
    "second , the measurements presented here can provide a useful reference for future @xmath0nmr experiments on heterostructures with pt overlayers , finite size effects in low - dimensional pt ( including the recently reported magnetism in pt nanoparticles @xcite ) , as well as depth - controlled experiments on samples that use pt as a substrate , or a component layer in a multilayer structure .",
    "a detailed understanding of the interaction of alkali metals with pt may also help to clarify their role in chemical catalysis @xcite .",
    "our main findings are that both the @xmath11li spin - lattice relaxation rate and ( surprisingly ) knight shift vary linearly from room temperature down to 3 k , although the bulk susceptibility does not .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy and compare the @xmath0nmr results with another implanted local probe , the positive muon , by making similar muon spin rotation ( @xmath12sr ) measurements of the knight shift on the same sample .",
    "the @xmath12sr results are less accurate because of the much shorter muon lifetime , and they are compatible with either the bulk @xmath6 or the @xmath1li shift .",
    "the pt sample is a high purity ( @xmath13 ) foil ( 0.001 \" thick ) weighing @xmath14  mg @xcite , folded into a @xmath15 mm square .",
    "the foil was initially annealed @xcite at 800 @xmath16c for 5 hours in oxygen and , prior to the @xmath0nmr experiments , was thoroughly cleaned with methanol ( fisher scientific ) .",
    "the @xmath11li @xmath0nmr was carried out on the polarized low energy beamline at triumf s isac facility @xcite where highly polarized ( @xmath17 ) @xmath1li@xmath2 probe nuclei ( nuclear spin @xmath18 , lifetime @xmath19=1.21 s , gyromagnetic ratio @xmath20  mhz / t ) are implanted into the pt foil .",
    "the experiments were carried out at an implantation energy of @xmath21 kev , corresponding to a range of @xmath22 nm and a straggle of @xmath23 nm . the asymmetry @xmath24 of the @xmath0-decay electron emission , proportional to the @xmath11li nuclear spin polarization , is recorded . for the resonance measurements ,",
    "a continuous beam of @xmath25 ions / s is focused into a beam spot of @xmath26 mm in diameter . a small pulsed radio - frequency magnetic field ( @xmath27 t )",
    "is applied transverse to the spin polarization .",
    "the central frequency @xmath28 of the rf pulses is randomly swept through an interval , and resonance is achieved when the larmor condition , i.e. rf frequency equal to @xmath29 , is satisfied , manifesting itself as a loss of the time - averaged @xmath30 at that frequency .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath31 is measured in a pulsed experimental mode using a 4  s beam - on pulse , followed by a 12  s counting period with beam off .",
    "this cycle is repeated on the order of 100 times to accumulate statistics for each measurement . here , the rf field is off at all times , and the time dependence of @xmath24 is monitored both during and after the pulse .",
    "the @xmath12sr data were collected at the m15 surface muon beamline at triumf using a low background insert in the helios spectrometer with an applied transverse field of @xmath32 t .",
    "the precession signal was weakly relaxing and was fit to a single exponentially damped oscillation with a small damping rate ( @xmath33  @xmath12s@xmath34 ) that is largely due to the random dipolar fields of the host @xmath35pt nuclei .",
    "this rate was approximately independent of temperature ( within @xmath36% ) .",
    "reference spectra in pure ag were collected simultaneously and used as the reference for the shift , accounting for the known knight shift of @xmath37 in ag @xcite .",
    "bulk susceptibility measurements were performed using a quantum design magnetic property measurement system superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) under the same field as the resonance measurements ( @xmath38  t ) .",
    "the inset of fig . [ fig : delta ] shows typical resonance spectra of @xmath11li@xmath2 in pt at @xmath39  k and @xmath40  k. in contrast to previous @xmath0nmr studies on other fcc metals ( ag @xcite , au @xcite , cu @xcite and pd @xcite ) , we find a single narrow resonance at all temperatures , with no evidence of multiple sites for the @xmath11li@xmath2 below 300  k. the observation of a single narrow resonance close to the larmor frequency with no quadrupolar splitting establishes that @xmath1li is located at a cubic site , which , in the fcc lattice could be the substitutional , the octahedral interstitial , or the tetrahedral interstitital site . by analogy with the other fcc metals ,",
    "it is very likely that below 300  k , @xmath1li@xmath2 occupies the octahedral interstitial site .",
    "we expect that at higher temperatures , with sufficient thermal energy , the @xmath1li will find a nearby vacancy and become substitutional , i.e. the site transition observed in other fcc metals occurs above 300  k. this is similar to pd and consistent with the higher formation energy for a vacancy ( and lower vacancy mobility ) in pt compared to the other metals we have studied @xcite .",
    "the resonance at all temperatures is well - described by a lorentzian , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the amplitude , @xmath28 and @xmath43 are the applied rf and the pt resonance frequencies , respectively .",

    "( b ) in contrast , @xmath51 for @xmath37 fits the bulk @xmath52 ( red curve ) . using the same fit parameters with @xmath53 yields the steep dashed blue curve , while fitting instead over the full temperature range provides nearly as good a fit as @xmath52 ( shallow blue dashed curve ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : delta ] shows that @xmath54 is linear in @xmath5 and furthermore , it is negative and monotonically decreasing in magnitude with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "this is similar to pd @xcite but different from other noble metals where a positive @xmath5-independent shift is observed @xcite .",
    "the negative shift is attributed to the hyperfine coupling due to hybridization of the ( nearly ) vacant li @xmath55 orbital with the host @xmath8 band , i.e.  @xmath7-@xmath8 hybridization \" @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when the @xmath8 band is filled , as in ag , for example , where it lies significantly below the fermi level , the hyperfine coupling to the implanted between @xmath1li and the partly filled @xmath7 band is positive .",
    "the nmr shift provides a local measure of the spin susceptibility , and to analyze it further , we require an independent measurement of the bulk susceptibility @xmath49 . to this end",
    ", we carried out a squid measurement of @xmath6 on the same sample .",
    "the results , after subtracting a temperature independent sample holder contribution ( @xmath56 @xmath57/g ) , are shown in comparison to conventional values from the literature @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : squid ] .",
    "the measured @xmath6 is consistent with the standard temperature dependence , exhibiting a saturation of the high temperature cw law below room temperature .",
    "@xmath6 also shows a small curie - like upturn at low temperature ( below 20 k ) that is attributed to a low concentration of residual magnetic impurities . to facilitate comparison of our results with the bulk susceptibility",
    ", we fit @xmath49 to a cw law ( at high temperature ) and to a phenomenological form @xmath52 that accounts for the low temperature saturation @xcite , see curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : squid ] .",
    "we use the measured @xmath49 ( in fact , @xmath58 ) to obtain the knight shift by correcting for demagnetization . assuming the pt foil behaves as a thin slab @xcite , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the density and the molar mass of pt .",
    "@xmath51 thus calculated is about 200 ppm smaller in magnitude than @xmath54 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k](a ) . since @xmath6 is almost @xmath5-independent below 300  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : squid ] ) , the correction to @xmath54 is also nearly constant , and the temperature dependence of @xmath4 shows only a small difference , exhibiting a slight curvature .",
    "knowledge of @xmath51 enables determination of the local electronic structure around the implanted li through the hybridization of its local ( @xmath55 ) electron with the pt conduction band(s ) .",
    "this hybridization leads to a hyperfine coupling @xmath62 . in the nmr of transition metals",
    ", @xmath4 is usually decomposed into three ( assumed independent ) contributions @xmath63 the first term is from the broad @xmath7 band , the second from the narrow @xmath8 band , and the third , from orbital screening ( the chemical shift ) , see ref .",
    ", for example .",
    "only the second term is assumed to have any temperature dependence .",
    "we note that hybridization mixes the character of the conduction bands in pt .",
    "while three bands cross the fermi level , only two make a substantial contribution to the density of states .",
    "one of these ( the @xmath64 band ) is broad while the other ( @xmath65 ) is substantially narrower , contributing about 80% of the density of states at @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we identify these as the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands , respectively , in our simplified discussion .",
    "we expect a similar decomposition of the shift applies to the @xmath1li impurity hyperfine - coupled to the host conduction bands , but the relative magnitudes of each term will be substantially different than for the host nuclear spins . in particular , with a small nuclear charge and only a few electrons , the orbital shift for @xmath1li is generally small ( less than 10 ppm ) . in fcc metals with filled @xmath8 bands , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath1li",
    "is on the order of + 100 ppm @xcite , so we may expect such a shift from the @xmath7 band in pt . however , with the present data , rather than using an uncertain decomposition of the temperature independent terms , we adopt the following simplified relation @xmath69 where @xmath4 is the corrected knight shift and @xmath6 is the measured total susceptibility ( without the impurity contribution , see below ) .",

    "( [ jacc ] ) . however , as is evident in the raw data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] ) , the shift does not saturate to a constant value below 300  k , and the fit using @xmath58 ( not shown ) is poor . above 250  k , where @xmath58 starts to show some @xmath5 dependence ,",
    "we can obtain a reasonable fit and extract the hyperfine coupling , but the curve [ red curve in fig .  [ fig : k](a ) ] deviates from the data at lower temperature . using this same coupling [ @xmath62 and @xmath70 from the fit to eq .",
    "( [ jacc ] ) ] but @xmath53 instead , yields the blue dashed curve that fits the data well down to base temperature . from the fit ,",
    "the hyperfine coupling for @xmath1li is @xmath71 kg/@xmath72 . with the assumption that the temperature dependence of @xmath6 is entirely from the @xmath8 band",
    ", @xmath62 is the coupling of the @xmath1li to the @xmath8 band .",
    "note the value is not divided by the number of nearest neighbours to give a per neighbour atomic value , rather it is the net value for the @xmath1li at this site .",
    "@xmath62 is thus substantially smaller in magnitude than the couplings to the @xmath7 band in the noble metals @xcite , but is similar to pd , where @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling is also important @xcite .    in contrast ,",
    "the knight shift of the positive muon , though less accurate due to the short muon lifetime , fits well to the bulk @xmath6 [ red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : k](b ) ] , with a hyperfine coupling @xmath73 kg/@xmath72 , roughly consistent with a previous report @xcite and similar to the @xmath1li . using this fit and @xmath53",
    "yields the steep dashed blue line that clearly deviates from the data .",
    "it should be noted , however , that due to the significant scatter , one can also fit the muon shift to @xmath53 nearly as well as to the saturating @xmath58 , see the shallow blue dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] , with a substantially smaller hyperfine coupling @xmath74 kg/@xmath72 .",
    "the hyperfine couplings for both the charged implanted probes are thus small , negative , and ( at least for the saturating fit of the muon shift ) similar in magnitude .",
    "however , the @xmath1li , at least , clearly shows a distinct @xmath5 dependence to the shift that is not consistent with the bulk @xmath49 .",
    "if the small curie - like contribution in @xmath6 is due to dilute magnetic impurities it should not contribute to the shift .",
    "instead , it should cause an additional inhomogeneous magnetic broadening scaling with that term in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : k ] shows there is no significant contribution to the shift .",
    "we can roughly estimate the broadening effect by noting that this term in @xmath6 is consistent with the curie law for @xmath75 ppm fe impurities with moment @xmath76 .",
    "this yields an estimated magnetic dipolar line broadening of @xmath77 khz at 6 k @xcite , a small fraction of the observed @xmath1li resonance width , consistent with the observed temperature independence of the linewidth .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath1li spin - lattice relaxation that is determined by electronic spin fluctuations . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] we plot representative data at two temperatures , 25 k and 295  k , in 4.1 t applied field .",
    "clearly , the relaxation rate , @xmath31 , decreases with decreasing temperatures .",
    "recall that the data are collected during and after a 4 second @xmath1li@xmath2 beam pulse . assuming a single exponential spin lattice relaxation ,",
    "the observed polarization is fit to the bipartite relaxation function , during @xmath78 and after @xmath79 the pulse @xcite , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 s. the relaxation rates @xmath31 extracted from the fits are shown in the main plot of fig .  [ fig : t1 ] , indicating that the reduction in @xmath31 with @xmath5 is monotonic and linear . the slope , @xmath83 ,",
    "is found to be comparable to that in other noble metals @xcite .",
    "such a temperature dependence is characteristic of relaxation due to spin flip scattering between the nucleus and the conduction electrons of a metal , i.e. the korringa mechanism .",
    "note that analogous measurements for the muon are not possible as the korringa relaxation time is much longer than the 2.2 @xmath12s muon lifetime .",
    "the absence of saturation in @xmath51 for @xmath1li is puzzling .",
    "this feature is thought to be intrinsic to the electronic susceptibility of pt , so it should be reflected in the shift .",
    "this appears to be the case for the host @xmath35pt nmr shift @xcite , though detailed low temperature studies are still lacking .",
    "the shift of the implanted @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : k](b ) may show the saturation , but these results are ambiguous , since the shift can equally be fit to the cw dependence .",
    "the results from another implanted probe ( @xmath84b ) are also not sufficiently accurate to determine the low temperature behaviour @xcite .",
    "the implanted probes present similar charged perturbations to the host , and the hyperfine couplings imply a similar coupling to the host conduction bands . however , there are subtle differences between @xmath37 and li@xmath2 .",
    "first , li@xmath2 has a @xmath85 core ( absent for the @xmath37 ) that yields a repulsive interaction with the surrounding pt atoms that will cause an increased lattice distortion .",
    "on the other hand , the light @xmath37 exhibits a large zero point motion that may also enhance the surrounding lattice relaxation .",
    "perhaps more significant is the difference in the distribution of the screening charge induced by the pointlike charged defect .",
    "the screening response of the pt conduction electrons ( friedel oscillations ) consists of a balancing unit of charge in the vicinity of the defect ( friedel sum rule ) , but the significantly stronger potential @xcite for the @xmath37 indicates that its screening cloud is considerably more compact than that of the li@xmath2 .    in comparison ,",
    "the @xmath35pt nmr knight shift is also negative but much larger ( @xmath86  % vs. @xmath87  ppm at room temperature ) .",
    "this is due to the large negative core - polarization hyperfine coupling to the @xmath8 band @xcite .",
    "the orbital shift of pt nuclei is also large , estimated to be 0.38% @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 follows the bulk susceptibility over a wide range in temperature [ e.g. , see curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : k](a ) ] .",
    "previous muon @xmath88 measurements in pt claim the tracking of the @xmath88 and the bulk @xmath6 @xcite , consistent with our findings . because of the relatively weak coupling , the @xmath1li and @xmath37 shifts are less sensitive to any weak temperature dependence of the orbital shift . for the same reason",
    ", it may also be easier to interpret @xmath4 in terms of contributions from the @xmath8 and @xmath7 band components of @xmath6 .",
    "the low temperature saturation of the spin susceptibility of nearly magnetic metals is not fully understood .",
    "the relatively low saturation temperature indicates that it is connected with a correspondingly small energy scale ( much less than the fermi energy , @xmath66 ) .",
    "it seems reasonable that an impurity could alter both the magnitude and temperature dependence of this local magnetic response .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in pd , where the low temperature dip in @xmath6 is not reflected in the @xmath1li shift @xcite .",
    "it appears that , at low temperature , the @xmath1li@xmath2 in pt may also be sensing a perturbed magnetic behaviour .",
    "however , the defect response is surprisingly simple , appearing to restore the high temperature cw behavior of the susceptibility all the way down to low temperatures , i.e. simply relieving the tendency to saturate .",
    "this is a strong clue to the origin of the saturation of @xmath6 of pt .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for this effect of li@xmath2 on the local @xmath6 within any of the theories that attempt to explain pt s",
    "@xmath49 @xcite , with the possibe exception of the spin fluctuation model @xcite . here",
    "we propose an alternate explanation . in the absence of the li",
    ", @xmath6 has contributions from both the wide @xmath7 band and the narrow @xmath8 band .",
    "we assume the former is pauli - like and @xmath5 independent and the latter follows the cw law . at high temperatures ,",
    "these contributions remain independent , but we suggest a small interband coupling exists with a characteristic energy scale on the order of 200 k , such that below the corresponding temperature , the bands are no longer independent but are locked together . apparently the @xmath5 independent @xmath7 band dominates and @xmath6 becomes @xmath5 independent .",
    "this interband coupling must be weak enough that it does nt substantially alter the overall band structure that is consistent with low temperature quantum oscillations @xcite .",
    "saturation by this mechanism is reminiscent ( perhaps fortuitously ) of the kondo screening of a local magnetic impurity by a degenerate conduction band , where far below the kondo temperature , the cw - like @xmath6 saturates @xcite . in this context",
    ", consider the effect of the interstitial li@xmath2 .",
    "we suggest that the combined effects of lattice relaxation and electronic screening cause a local disruption in the interband coupling thereby restoring the @xmath8 band cw behaviour down to much lower temperatures .    in this context",
    ", it is interesting to compare with the effects of other impurities in pt .",
    "lithium - platinum alloys and intermetallic compounds are known @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 of pt is rapidly _ suppressed _ by alloying with li ( or other main group elements @xcite ) , in contrast to our @xmath4 . in a rigid band picture , this is attributed to a doping effect that moves the fermi level away from the narrow @xmath8 band density of states peak . in our measurements ,",
    "the number of implanted @xmath1li in the sample at any time is extremely small ( less than @xmath89 , i.e. the dilute limit ) , so we do not expect any measurable change in the overall e@xmath90 .",
    "however , @xmath6 may be altered locally . as mentioned above",
    ", the li@xmath2 attracts a screening cloud of one unit of charge to its vicinity ( the neighbouring pt ) altering the local electronic structure and thus the magnetic response .",
    "such behaviour is well - established for _ nonmagnetic _ transition metal substituents in pt .",

    ", pt nmr reveals this impurity effect on the pt host is inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "satellite lines of the spin 1/2 @xmath35pt nmr show the knight shift is modified over several near neighbour shells around the impurity , presumably due to a variation of the local density of states as it heals away from the impurity perturbation towards the bulk value . in nearly all cases , however ,",
    "the satellites have a knight shift that is _ smaller in magnitude _ than the bulk shift . presuming the pt hyperfine coupling is unaltered",

    "however , the temperature dependence of the local @xmath6 ( either from the perspective of the impurity or the nearby host ) has not been studied in detail .",
    "the relatively large changes in the pt shift near the impurity suggest that the temperature dependence might well be modified .",
    "theoretical studies show perturbative effects of nonmagnetic impurities are expected @xcite , but no detailed explanation of the local pt response has been advanced",
    ". it would be interesting to extend these meaurements to see if our finding of the recovery of the cw dependence is general .",
    "it would also be interesting to study intrinsic point defects in pt ( vacancies , interstitials ) in this regard .",
    "such defects , induced by irradiation , can yield superconductivity in closely related pd @xcite which is at odds with an increased magnetic response .    for spin lattice relaxation from a single band , the simplest case of the korringa law ,",
    "the korringa product , @xmath91 , is a constant independent of temperature @xcite .",
    "@xmath92 can be enhanced substantially , even in simple metals , by electronic correlations @xcite . for @xmath1li in pt , though @xmath4 is @xmath5 dependent , the enhancement is relatively modest ( @xmath93 ) at room temperature increasing to @xmath94 at low temperatures .",
    "stronger correlations in the form of spin fluctuations may be invoked to explain the @xmath5 dependent susceptibility of exchange enhanced paramagnetic metals such as pt and pd . as these effects become even stronger , on the approach to metallic ferromagnetism , one finds the korringa law itself",
    "is modified : the korringa slope @xmath83 acquires a temperature dependence that generally increases with decreasing @xmath5 @xcite . as for @xmath1li in pd , fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] shows no evidence of this latter effect .",
    "the @xmath5 linear korringa dependence of @xmath3 down to low temperature shows no indication of a deviation related to the distinct @xmath5 dependence of the shift , suggesting that , while spin fluctuations may be important to the static uniform @xmath49 , they are not playing a substantial role in the spin relaxation . since both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are linear in @xmath5 , @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath95 , an unexpected ( though simple ) result .    rather than a naive application of the single band korringa law",
    ", however , we should consider separately the contributions of different bands .",
    "when several bands cross @xmath66 , the korringa slope @xmath83 consists of approximately independent contributions ( similar to the shifts ) @xcite . in this case , the overall korringa slope should still follow a generalized korringa law , @xmath96 where the weights @xmath97 for each band , sometimes known as `` disenhancement '' factors , may be either larger or smaller than one @xcite . note that , although different contributions to the shift may have opposite sign [ eq .",
    "( [ shiftcomps ] ) ] , contributions to @xmath3 are all additive .",
    "we suspect this is the case for the shift in pt where the @xmath7 contribution is likely positive , partially cancelling the negative @xmath8 band shift .",
    "( [ genkor ] ) admits a particularly simple resolution to the problem of a simultaneous linear temperature dependence of both @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "namely , if the weighting factor @xmath97 for the @xmath8 band is much less than for the @xmath7 band , then @xmath3 is dominated by the @xmath7 band and remains linear in @xmath5 even though the shift from the @xmath8 band varies with @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath5 dependent @xmath8 band shift is effectively decoupled from @xmath3 .",
    "this is also consistent with the magnitude of the korringa slope for @xmath1li being comparable to the noble metals @xcite , but contrasts to the case of @xmath35pt nmr , where there are significant contributions from both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands as well as the orbital relaxation @xcite .    for magnetically enhanced metals like",
    "pt , the weighting @xmath97 can be small because the shift senses the enhanced uniform static susceptibility at infinite wavelength ( @xmath98 ) , while the spin lattice relaxation is determined by a sum over the entire brillouin zone of the low frequency dynamic susceptibility that may be substantially less enhanced .",
    "another factor determining @xmath97 in transition metals has to do with orbital degeneracy of the @xmath8 band .",
    "the @xmath8 electron core - polarization hyperfine coupling is approximately the same for each @xmath8 orbital , so only fluctuations that are in phase between degenerate bands contribute effectively to spin relaxation @xcite .",
    "a similar consideration may apply in the case of the @xmath7-@xmath8 coupling to the interstitial @xmath1li .",
    "indeed , such an analysis of the @xmath35pt nmr does predict @xmath97 for the @xmath8 band is less than 10% that of the @xmath7 band .",
    "detailed calculations are required to confirm whether such a small value of @xmath97 for the @xmath8 band is reasonable for li .",
    "to summarize , we measured the knight shift and spin - lattice relaxation rate of dilute @xmath1li@xmath2 implanted in high purity pt .",
    "below 300 k , the bulk susceptibility is approximately pauli - like ( @xmath5 independent ) , but exhibits a slight temperature dependence and , below @xmath99  k , a minor magnetic impurity contribution , consistent with previous measurements .",
    "in contrast , the knight shift varies approximately linearly with temperature .",
    "it does not scale with @xmath6 .",
    "this discrepancy suggests the magnetic response of pt is locally modified by the interstitial @xmath1li@xmath2 similar to the case in pd @xcite .",
    "local perturbation of pt s magnetic response is well established for nonmagnetic transition metals .",
    "however , we have found that ( at least for the case of @xmath1li ) the perturbed response adopts a particularly simple form , namely the extension of the high temperature curie - weiss behaviour down to low temperature .",
    "such a distinct isolated impurity response may shed light on the origin of the temperature dependent susceptibility of pt and to transition metals in general . from this , the single band korringa product @xmath92 that varies approximately as @xmath95 at low temperature .",
    "this unusual result might be explained by a detailed theoretical calculation of the exchange enhanced metallic state . on the other hand , the korringa slope , consisting of contributions from both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands ,",
    "may simply be dominated by the @xmath7 band . in this case",
    ", one can obtain @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are both linear in temperature .",
