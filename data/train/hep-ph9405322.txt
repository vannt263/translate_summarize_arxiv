    "despite the success of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , there is little faith that the sm is the final theory .",
    "the reasons behind this are fundamental and basic @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , the sm contains many arbitrary parameters with no apparent connections . besides , the sm provides no satisfactory explanation for the symmetry breaking mechanism which takes place and gives rise to the observed mass spectrum of the gauge bosons and fermions . in this work ,",
    "we study how to use the top quark to probe the origin of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of fermion masses .",
    "there are strong experimental and theoretical arguments suggesting the top quark must exist @xcite ; _",
    "e.g. _ , from the measurement of the weak isospin quantum number of the left  handed @xmath6 quark we know the top quark has to exist . from the direct search at the tevatron , assuming sm top quark , @xmath7 has to be larger than 131gev @xcite .",
    "recently , data were presented by the cdf group at fnal to support the existence of a heavy top quark with mass @xmath8gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies on radiative corrections concluded that the mass ( @xmath7 ) of a standard top quark has to be less than @xmath9gev @xcite .",
    "however , there are no compelling reasons to believe that the top quark couplings to light particles should be of the sm nature .",
    "because the top quark is heavy relative to other observed fundamental particles , one expects that any underlying theory at high energy scale @xmath10 will easily reveal itself at low energy through the effective interactions of the top quark to other light particles . also because the top quark mass is of the order of the fermi scale @xmath11gev , which characterizes the electroweak symmetry breaking scale",
    ", the top quark may be a useful tool to probe the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "since the fermion mass generation can be closely related to the electroweak symmetry breaking , one expects some residual effects of this breaking to appear in accordance with the generated mass @xcite .",
    "this means new effects should be more apparent in the top quark sector than any other light sector of the theory .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the top quark system as a direct tool to probe new physics effects @xcite .    undoubtedly , any real analysis including the top quark can not be completed without actually discovering it . in the sm , which is a renormalizable theory , the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons are fixed by the linear realization of the gauge symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "however , the top quark mass remains a free parameter in the theory ( sm ) .",
    "if the top quark is not a sm quark , then in addition to the unknown top mass , the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons are not known .",
    "also , the effective theory describing the top quark interactions at low energy can be non  renormalizable .",
    "therefore , to conclude the properties of the top quark from the radiative corrections is less vital and predictive .",
    "still , precision data at this stage are our best hope to look for any possible deviation in the top quark sector from the sm .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons from the precision data at lep and examine how to improve our knowledge about the top quark at the current and future colliders .",
    "also we will discuss how to use this knowledge to probe the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "generally one studies a specific model ( _ e.g. _ , a grand unified theory ) valid up to some high energy scale and evolves that theory down to the electroweak scale to compare its predictions with the precision lep data @xcite .",
    "such an approach provides a consistent analysis for low energy data .",
    "in addition to such a model by model study , one can incorporate new physics effects in a model independent way formulated in terms of either a set of variables @xcite or an effective lagrangian @xcite . in this work , we will adopt the latter approach .",
    "we simply address the problem in the following way .",
    "assume there is an underlying theory at some high energy scale .",
    "how does this theory _ appreciably _ manifest itself at low energy ? because we do not know the shape of the underlying theory and because a general treatment is usually very complicated , we can not provide a satisfying answer .",
    "still , one can get some crude answers to this question based on a few _ negotiable _ arguments suggested by the status of low energy data with the application of the electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "it is generally believed that new physics is likely to come in via processes involving longitudinal gauge bosons ( equivalent to goldstone bosons ) and/or heavy fermions such as the top quark .",
    "one commonly discussed method to probe the electroweak symmetry sector is to study the interactions among the longitudinal gauge bosons in the tev region .",
    "tremendous work has been done in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the subject of this paper . as we argued above",
    ", the top quark plays an important role in the search for new physics .",
    "because of its heavy mass , new physics will feel its presence easily and eventually may show up in its couplings to the gauge bosons . if the top quark is a participant in a dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism , _",
    "e.g. _ , through the @xmath13 condensate ( top mode standard model ) @xcite which is suggested by the fact that its mass is of the order of the fermi scale @xmath14 , then the top quark is one of the best candidates for search of new physics .",
    "an attempt to study the non  universal interactions of the top quark has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite by peccei _",
    "et al_. however , in that study only the vertex was considered based on the assumption that this is the only vertex which gains a significant modification due to a speculated dependence of the coupling strength on the fermion mass : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 parameterizes some new dimensional  four interactions among gauge bosons and fermions @xmath17 and @xmath18 . however , this is not the only possible pattern of interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ , in some extended technicolor models @xcite one finds that the non  universal residual interactions associated with the vertices , and to be of the same order . in section",
    "iv we discuss the case of the sm with a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath19 ) in which we find the size of the non  universal effective interactions and to be of the same order but with a negligible effect .    here is the outline of our approach",
    "first , we use the chiral lagrangian approach @xcite to construct the most general @xmath20 invariant effective lagrangian including up to dimension  four operators for the top and bottom quarks .",
    "then we deduce the sm ( with and without a scalar higgs boson ) from this lagrangian , and only consider new physics effects which modify the top quark couplings to gauge bosons and possibly the vertex . with this in hand ,",
    "we perform a comprehensive analysis using precision data from lep .",
    "we include the contributions from the vertex in addition to the vertex , and discuss the special case of having a comparable size in as in . secondly , we build an effective model with an approximate custodial symmetry ( @xmath21 ) connecting the and couplings .",
    "this reduces the number of parameters in the effective lagrangian and strengthens its structure and predictability . after examining what we have learned from the lep data ,",
    "we study how to improve our knowledge on these couplings at the slc , the tevatron , the lhc ( large hadron collider ) and the nlc ( next linear collider ) @xcite .",

    "in section v we discuss how the slc , tevatron , lhc and nlc can contribute to the measurement of these couplings . some discussion and conclusions",
    "are given in section vi .",
    "the chiral lagrangian approach has been used in understanding the low energy strong interactions because it can systematically describe the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "recently , the chiral lagrangian technique has been widely used in studying the electroweak sector @xcite , to which this work has been directed .",
    "the chiral lagrangian can be constructed solely on symmetry with no other assumptions regarding explicit dynamics .",
    "thus , it is the most general effective lagrangian that can accommodate any truly fundamental theory possessing that symmetry at low energy .",
    "since one is interested in the low energy behavior of such a theory , an expansion in powers of the external momentum is performed in the chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "in general one starts from a lie group g which breaks down spontaneously into a subgroup h , hence a goldstone boson for every broken generator is to be introduced @xcite .",
    "consider for example g  @xmath24 and h  @xmath25 .",
    "there are three goldstone bosons generated by this breakdown , @xmath26 which are eventually eaten by @xmath27 and @xmath28 and become the longitudinal degree of freedom of these gauge bosons .",
    "the goldstone bosons transform non ",
    "linearly under g but linearly under the subgroup h. a convenient way to handle this is to introduce the matrix field = exp(i ) , where @xmath29 are the pauli matrices normalized as @xmath30 . because of @xmath31 invariance @xmath32 , but is not necessarily equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the matrix field @xmath34 transforms under g as ^=exp(i ) exp(-iy ) , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the group parameters of g.    in the sm , being a special case of the chiral lagrangian , @xmath37gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson field .",
    "also @xmath38 arises from the approximate custodial symmetry in the sm .",

    "@xmath50 , @xmath51 and the goldstone bosons matrix field @xmath34 the usual linearly realized fields @xmath52 can be constructed .",

    "r= f_r = f_1_r .[psr ] out of those fields with the specified transformations it is straightforward to construct a lagrangian which is invariant under @xmath59 .",
    "since the interactions among the light fermions and the gauge bosons have been well tested to agree with the sm , we only consider new interactions involving the top and bottom quarks .",

    "the right  handed charged current contribution @xmath3 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) is expected to be suppressed by the bottom quark mass .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",
    "if @xmath6 is massless ( @xmath79 ) , then the left and right  handed @xmath6 fields can be associated with different global @xmath80 quantum numbers .",
    "( @xmath80 is a chiral group , not the hypercharge group . ) since the underlying theory has an exact @xmath59 symmetry at high energy , the charged currents are purely left  handed before the symmetry is broken .",
    "after the symmetry is spontaneously broken and for a massless @xmath6 the @xmath80 symmetry associated with @xmath81 remains exact ( chiral invariant ) so it is not possible to generate right  handed charged currents .",
    "thus @xmath3 is usually suppressed by the bottom quark mass although it could be enhanced in some models with a larger group g , _ i.e. _ , in models containing additional right  handed gauge bosons .",
    "+ we find that in the limit of ignoring the bottom quark mass , @xmath3 does not contribute to low energy data through loop insertion at the order @xmath4 , therefore we can not constrain @xmath3 from the lep data . however , at the tevatron and the lhc @xmath3 can be measured by studying the direct detection of the top quark and its decays .",
    "this will be discussed in    it is worth mentioning that the photon does not participate in the new non  universal interactions as described in the chiral lagrangian @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) because the @xmath31 symmetry remains an exact symmetry of the effective theory . using ward identities one can show that such non  universal terms should not appear . to be precise , any new physics can only contribute to the universal interactions of the photon to charged fields .",
    "this effect can simply be absorbed in redefining the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath82 , hence no new or interaction terms will appear in the effective lagrangian after a proper renormalization of @xmath82 .",
    "here is a final note regarding the physical higgs boson .",
    "it is known that the gauge bosons acquire masses through the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism . in the chiral lagrangian",
    "this can be seen from the last term in @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "( [ yeq4 ] ) ) , which only involves the gauge bosons and the unphysical goldstone bosons .",
    "this indicates that the chiral lagrangian can account for the mass generation of the gauge bosons without the actual details of the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the fermion mass term is also allowed in the chiral lagrangian , -m_f_if_i , because it is invariant under g , where the fermion field @xmath84 transforms as in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .    from this",
    "it is clear the higgs boson is not necessary in constructing the low energy effective lagrangian . indicating that the sm higgs mechanism is just one example of the possible spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios which might take place in nature .",
    "still , a higgs boson can be inserted in the chiral lagrangian as an additional field ( @xmath12 singlet ) with arbitrary couplings to the rest of the fields . to retrieve the sm higgs boson contribution at tree level",
    ", one can simply substitute the fermion mass @xmath85 by @xmath86 and @xmath14 by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the yukawa coupling for fermion @xmath49 and @xmath89 is the higgs boson field . hence , we get the scalar sector lagrangian _ h= _",
    "h ^ h -m_h h^2 -v(h ) + vhtr ( d_^d^ ) + h^2tr ( d_^d^ ) , [ higg ] where @xmath90 describes the higgs boson self  interaction .",
    "the coefficients of the last two terms in the above equation can be arbitrary for a chiral lagrangian with a scalar field other than the sm higgs boson .    in this analysis",
    ", we will discuss models with and without a higgs boson . in the case of a light higgs boson ( @xmath91 ) we will include the higgs boson field in the chiral lagrangian as a part of the light fields with no new physics being associated with it .",
    "in the case of a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath19 ) in the full theory , we assume the higgs boson field has been integrated out and its effect on low energy physics can be thought of as a new heavy physics effect which is already included in the effective couplings of the top quark at the scale of @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we will consider the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario without including a sm higgs boson in the full theory . in this case",
    "we consider the effects on low energy data from the new physics parameterized by the non ",
    "standard interaction terms in @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and contributions from the sm without a higgs boson .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , one possibility of new physics effects is the modification of the vertices , and in the effective lagrangian by the same order of magnitude @xcite . in this case",
    ", only the vertex can have large contributions to low energy data while , based on the dimensional counting method , the contributions from the other two vertices and are suppressed by @xmath92 due to their insertion in loops .    in this case , one can use @xmath93 ( the partial decay width of the @xmath28 boson to @xmath94 ) to constrain the coupling .",
    "denote the non  standard vertex as _ ( 1-_5 ) , which is purely left - handed . in some extended technicolor models , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this non  standard effect arises from the same source as the mass generation of the top quark , therefore @xmath95 depends on the top quark mass .",
    "as we will discuss later , the non  universal contribution to @xmath93 is parameterized by a measurable parameter denoted as @xmath96 @xcite which is measured to be @xcite _",

    "the contribution from @xmath95 to @xmath96 is _ b=- . within 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) , from @xmath96 we find that -22.9 ( 10 ^ 3 ) 4.4 .    as an example , the simple commuting extended technicolor model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that ^2 , where @xmath97 is of order 1 .",

    "this model predicts ( 10 ^ 3)24.3 ^2 .",
    "hence , such a model is likely to be excluded using low energy data .",
    "we will devote the subsequent discussion to models in which the non  standard coupling can be ignored relative to the and couplings . in this case",
    "one needs to study their effects at the quantum level , _",
    "i.e. _ , through loop insertion . we will first discuss the general case where no relations between the couplings are assumed .",
    "later we will impose a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 which are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) using an effective model with an approximate custodial symmetry .",
    "the chiral lagrangian in general has a complicated structure and many arbitrary coefficients which weaken its predictive power .",
    "still , with a few further assumptions , based on the status of present low energy data , the chiral lagrangian can provide a useful approach to confine the coefficients parameterizing new physics effects .    in this subsection",
    ", we provide a general treatment for the case under study with minimal imposed assumptions in the chiral lagrangian . in this case",

    "we note that the polarization of the @xmath234 boson can also be studied from the distribution of @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the polar angle of @xmath110 in the rest frame of the @xmath234 boson whose z  axis is the @xmath234 bosons moving direction in the rest frame of the top quark @xcite . for a massless @xmath6",
    ", @xmath255 is related to @xmath257 by .",
    "however , in reality , the momenta of the bottom quark and the charged lepton will be smeared by the detector effects and the most serious problem in this analysis is the identification of the right @xmath6 to reconstruct @xmath61 .",
    "there are two strategies to improve the efficiency of identifying the right @xmath6 .",
    "one is to demand a large invariant mass of the @xmath249 system so that @xmath61 is boosted and its decay products are collimated .",
    "namely , the right @xmath6 will be moving closer to the lepton from @xmath61 decay .",
    "this can be easily enforced by demanding lepton @xmath110 with large transverse momentum .",
    "another is to identify the non  isolated lepton from @xmath238 decay ( with a branching ratio @xmath258 ) .",
    "both of these methods will further reduce the reconstructed signal rate by an order of magnitude .",
    "how will these affect our conclusion on the determination of the non ",
    "universal couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 ?",
    "this can not be answered in the absence of detailed monte carlo studies .    here",
    "we propose to probe the couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 by measuring the production rate of the single ",
    "top quark events . a single  top quark event can be produced from either the @xmath234gluon fusion process @xmath259 , or the drell  yan type process @xmath260 .",
    "including both the single@xmath61 and single@xmath261 events , for a 2 ( 3.5 ) tev collider , the @xmath234gluon fusion rate is 2 ( 16 ) pb ; the drell  yan type rate is 0.6 ( 1.5 ) pb . the drell  yan type event is easily separated from the @xmath234-gluon fusion event , therefore will not be considered hereafter @xcite . for the decay mode of @xmath262 , with @xmath248 , the branching ratio of interest is @xmath263 .",
    "the kinematic acceptance of this event at @xmath242tev is found to be @xmath264 @xcite .",
    "if the efficiency of @xmath6tagging is 30% , there will be @xmath265 single - top quark events reconstructed . at @xmath253tev",
    "the kinematic acceptance of this event is @xmath266 which , from the above calculation yields about @xmath267 reconstructed events .",
    "based on statistical error alone , this corresponds to a 12% and 4% measurement on the single  top cross section .",
    "a factor of 10 increase in the luminosity of the collider can improve the measurement by a factor of 3 statistically .",
    "taking into account the theoretical uncertainties , we examine two scenarios : 20% and 50% error on the measurement of the single  top cross section , which depends on both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "( here we assume the experimental data agrees with the sm prediction within 20% ( 50% ) . )",
    "we found that for a @xmath268gev top quark @xmath2 and @xmath3 are well constrained inside the region bounded by two ( approximate ) ellipses , as shown in fig .",
    "these results are not sensitive to the energies of the colliders considered here .",
    "the top quark produced from the @xmath234gluon fusion process is almost one hundred percent left ",
    "handed ( right  handed ) polarized for a left  handed ( right  handed ) @xmath269 vertex , therefore the charged lepton @xmath250 from @xmath61 decay has a harder momentum in a right",
    " handed @xmath269 coupling than in a left  handed coupling .",
    "( note that the couplings of light ",
    "fermions to @xmath234 boson have been well tested from the low energy data to be left  handed as described in the sm . )",
    "this difference becomes smaller when the top quark is more massive because the @xmath234 boson from the top quark decay tends to be more longitudinally polarized .",
    "a right  handed charged current is absent in a linearly @xmath53 invariant gauge theory with massless bottom quark . in this case ,",
    "@xmath237 , then @xmath2 can be constrained to within about @xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) with a 20% ( 50% ) error on the measurement of the the single",
    " top quark production rate at the tevatron .",
    "this means that if we interpret as the ckm matrix element @xmath60 , then @xmath60 can be bounded as @xmath272 ( or 0.8 ) for a 20% ( or 50% ) error on the measurement of the single",
    " top production rate .",
    "recall that if there are more than three generations , within 90% c.l .",
    ", @xmath60 can be anywhere between 0 and 0.9995 from low energy data @xcite .",
    "this measurement can therefore provide useful information on possible additional fermion generations .",
    "we expect the lhc can provide similar or better bounds on these non  standard couplings when detail analyses are available .",
    "the best place to probe @xmath0 and @xmath1 associated with the coupling is at the nlc through @xmath273 .",
    "( we use nlc to represent a generic @xmath22 supercollider @xcite . ) a detail monte carlo study on the measurement of these couplings at the nlc including detector effects and initial state radiation can be found in ref .",
    "the bounds were obtained by studying the angular distribution and the polarization of the top quark produced in @xmath274 collisions . assuming a 50 @xmath244 luminosity at @xmath275gev",
    ", we concluded that within 90% confidence level , it should be possible to measure @xmath0 to within about 8% , while @xmath1 can be known to within about 18% .",
    "a @xmath276tev machine can do better than a @xmath277gev machine in determining @xmath0 and @xmath1 because the relative sizes of the @xmath278 and @xmath279 production rates become small and the polarization of the @xmath249 pair is purer .",
    "namely , it s more likely to produce either a @xmath280 or a @xmath281 pair",
    ". a purer polarization of the @xmath249 pair makes @xmath0 and @xmath1 better determined .",
    "( the purity of the @xmath249 polarization can be further improved by polarizing the electron beam . ) furthermore , the top quark is boosted more in a @xmath276tev machine thereby allowing a better determination of its polar angle in the @xmath249 system because it is easier to find the right @xmath6 associated with the lepton to reconstruct the top quark moving direction .",
    "finally , we remark that at the nlc , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be studied either from the decay of the top quark pair or from the single ",
    "top quark production process ; @xmath234photon fusion process @xmath282 , or @xmath283 , which is similar to the @xmath234gluon fusion process in hadron collisions .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the electroweak chiral lagrangian to probe new physics beyond the sm through studying the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons .",
    "we first examined the precision lep data to extract the information on these couplings , then we discussed how to improve our knowledge at current and future colliders such as at the tevatron , the lhc and the nlc .    due to the non  renormalizability of the electroweak chiral lagrangian , we can only estimate the size of these non  standard couplings by studying the contributions to lep observables at the order of @xmath284 , where @xmath285 tev is the cut  off scale of the effective lagrangian .",
    "already we found interesting constraints on these couplings .",
    "assuming vertex is not modified , we found that @xmath0 is already constrained to be @xmath286 ( @xmath287 ) by lep data at the 95% c.l .",
    "for a 150 ( 175)gev top quark . although @xmath1 and @xmath2 are allowed to be in the full range of @xmath288 , the precision lep data do impose some correlations among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath3 does not contribute to the lep observables of interest in the limit of @xmath79 . ) in our calculations , these non  standard couplings are only inserted once in loop diagrams using dimensional regularization .    inspired by the experimental fact @xmath21 , reflecting the existence of an approximate custodial symmetry , we proposed an effective model to relate @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "we found that the non  universal interactions of the top quark to gauge bosons parameterized by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are well constrained by lep data , within 95% c.l .",
    "the results are summarized in ( see also figs .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) and ( [ f6 ] ) ) .",
    "also , the two parameters @xmath289 and @xmath290 are strongly correlated . in our model , @xmath291 .",
    "we note that the relations among @xmath95 s can be used to test different models of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , a heavy sm higgs boson ( @xmath19 ) will modify the couplings and of a heavy top quark at the scale @xmath7 such that @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath237 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the upper bound on the top quark mass can be raised from the sm bound @xmath294gev to as large as 300gev if new physics occurs .",
    "that is to say , if there is new physics associated with the top quark , it is possible that the top quark is heavier than what the sm predicts , a similar conclusion was reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with a better measurement of @xmath229 at the slc ,",
    "more constraint can be set on the correlation between @xmath198 and @xmath199 . to constrain the size of @xmath198 and @xmath199 , we need a more precise measurement on the partial decay width @xmath295 .    undoubtedly , direct detection of the top quark at the tevatron , the lhc and the nlc is crucial to measuring the couplings of and . at hadron colliders ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 can be measured by studying the polarization of the @xmath234 boson from top quark decay in @xmath249 events .",
    "they can also be measured simply from the production rate of the single top quark event .",
    "the nlc is the best machine to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 which can be measured from studying the angular distribution and the polarization of the top quark produced in @xmath274 collision .",
