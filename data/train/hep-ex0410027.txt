    "a number of experiments have recently reported a narrow peak in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mass spectra near 1.54 gev/@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "negative searches have also been reported @xcite . a resonance in the @xmath5 system with strangeness + 1 and baryon number + 1 would require five quarks as constituents .",
    "the @xmath6 system , on the other hand , is ambiguous since the strangeness could be either @xmath8 requiring the system to be  exotic \" , or @xmath9 like the normal hyperons . the presumed pentaquark state is referred to as the @xmath10 . the width of the peak seems to be narrower than the experimental mass resolutions , which vary between about 9 and 27 mev/@xmath7 .",
    "however , cahn and trilling @xcite argue that the intrinsic width would have to be @xmath41 mev/@xmath7 based on the data of barmin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and @xmath11 cross section data .",
    "this is far narrower than any previously discovered hadronic resonance , and therefore the dynamics of the @xmath10 decay would have to be  exotic \" , as well as its quantum numbers . on the other hand , the production of @xmath10 , which involves the rearrangement of quarks , just as in any other hadronic production process",
    ", should not be exotic .",
    "thus , for example , a virtual _ n * _ produced diffractively from an incident proton could decay into a @xmath10 and @xmath12 , and a @xmath13 scattering off a neutron could produce @xmath14 .",
    "the general expectation is that the inclusive @xmath10 production cross sections should be fairly large , especially for @xmath13 beams @xcite , and approximately energy independent well above threshold , just as for any other hadronic state .",
    "the hypercp detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] ) is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it was designed principally to investigate _ cp _ violation in @xmath15 decays .",
    "a charged secondary beam was produced at 0@xmath16 by 800  gev protons interacting in a copper target .",
    "a collimator channel was embedded in a 6.0-meter - long dipole magnet with a field of 1.667  t that deflected the secondary beam upward at an angle of 19.5  mrad .",
    "the exit aperture of the collimator was 2  cm wide by 1  cm high made with machined tungsten blocks .",
    "the collimator selected a broad momentum band ranging from about 120 to 220  gev/@xmath2 . when a positively charged secondary beam was selected , the beam was a mixture of mainly protons and @xmath17 , with about 5% @xmath13 , and a smaller fraction of positively charged hyperons .",
    "most of the long - lived particles produced in the target passed through an evacuated pipe ( vacuum decay region ) and encountered only the thin windows of the vacuum decay region and wire chambers that were in the beam , while most hyperons decayed in the vacuum decay region or upstream of it .",
    "however , over half of the triggers recorded were from events produced in the tungsten near the exit of the defining collimator .",
    "events produced there were used in the pentaquark search .        the hypercp spectrometer employed two dipole magnets ( analyzing magnets ) with a total bending power of 4.72 t m. the analyzing magnets were preceded by four wire chambers and followed by five wire chambers .",
    "each chamber had two planes of vertical wires and planes with wires inclined at angles of @xmath18 and @xmath19 to the vertical .",
    "the wire pitches ranged from 1  mm for the upstream chambers to 2  mm for the larger downstream chambers .",
    "the momentum resolution of the spectrometer was 0.44% at 100  gev/@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer and data acquisition @xcite were designed for high rates , and in the course of the experiment , @xmath20 triggers were recorded on magnetic tape .",
    "the majority of the running was done using a positive - polarity secondary beam in order to obtain a sufficiently large sample of @xmath21@xmath22 decays for the _ cp _ violation test .",
    "the trigger used for the pentaquark search required a coincidence between hits in scintillation counter hodoscopes on either side of the beam .",
    "this trigger was prescaled by a factor of 100 , so that only 1% of the potential candidates were recorded .",
    "the experiment did not have particle identification .",
    "however , @xmath23 decays could be cleanly identified by reconstructing the two - pion mass and requiring that it be consistent with the @xmath24 mass",
    ". charged tracks with @xmath25 50% of the total momentum had a very high probability of being protons .",
    "thus the pentaquark search was restricted to the decay @xmath26 .",
    "for the pentaquark search , events were selected with vertices originating from the lower lip of the tungsten collimator .",
    "cuts on the vertex position along the beam direction were applied to select events originating in the last 20  cm of the collimator .",
    "the vertical position of the vertex was required to be within 4.0  mm of the top edge of the lower lip of the collimator .",
    "events were rejected if their total momentum vector traced back to the production target .",
    "events with three or more tracks were chosen with the total momentum of all tracks between 120 and 250 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "events containing @xmath27 or @xmath28 decays were rejected .",
    "cuts were also made to reject  ghost \" tracks which are near - duplicate tracks generated by the track - fitting program .",
    "( events with ghost tracks from @xmath29 decays that also fit the @xmath1 hypothesis were found to give a narrow peak at 1.54 gev/@xmath7 in the @xmath6 mass @xcite ) .",

    "( b ) monte carlo simulation of the @xmath32(0.892 ) produced in the last 20  cm of the collimator .",
    "the simulation assumes a breit - wigner shape with a full width @xmath33 = 51  mev.,width=288 ]    note that the high beam momentum and broad momentum spread in the beam are advantages in the pentaquark search because the mechanism proposed by dzierba _",
    "_ @xcite by which narrow enhancements in the @xmath34 mass distribution can be produced through kinematic reflections of mesons , such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , would not be effective . also , the kinematic reflection mechanism for producing false mass peaks involving @xmath24 and @xmath37 decay overlap , as suggested by zavertyaev @xcite , would not work .",
    "events with @xmath38 s were selected by requiring that the two lower momentum particles have opposite sign and reconstructing their mass under the @xmath39 assumption .",
    "events with @xmath40 s were used to search for @xmath41 decays that were produced in the collimator .",
    "figure  [ fig : k_star ] compares the @xmath32(0.892 ) signal with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the @xmath32 signal was isolated by subtracting the @xmath42 mass distribution for events with a @xmath39 mass in the @xmath40 mass sidebands from the @xmath43 mass distribution .",
    "a similar subtraction was used to isolate the @xmath44(1.385 ) resonance peak in @xmath45 events ; this also agreed with monte carlo expectations .",

    "the expected rms mass resolution is about 11  mev/@xmath7 with a non - gaussian distribution . in the total sample of 106000 @xmath6 and @xmath52 candidates",
    "there is no sign of a peak near 1.54  gev/@xmath7 .",

    "this shows the maximum number of events in the putative @xmath53 peak to be 317 at 90% confidence level .",
    "thus we find that at most 0.3% of the @xmath6 candidates could come from @xmath10 decays . by comparison , barmin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported 29 events in their @xmath10 peak among 541 @xmath6 events with a similar mass spectrum in the diana bubble chamber experiment . because of the large momentum spread and mixed beam composition , as well as the unknown production spectrum , it was not possible to estimate limits for @xmath54 production cross sections .",

    "the main differences between our experiment and those that reported @xmath3 peaks are the higher beam energy , a mixed beam containing @xmath58 and charged hyperons with a broad momentum spread , as well as better mass resolution and far more events .",
    "there is no fundamental reason why the ratio of @xmath10 to overall @xmath59 production should decrease significantly at higher beam energies . to produce a pentaquark",
    ", a beam proton has to pick up a @xmath60 quark pair from the sea . to produce a @xmath61",
    "quarks need to be created . naively one would expect @xmath10 production to be much larger than @xmath62 . yet",
    "the data sample used in the pentaquark search contained over 75000 @xmath62 decays and 70000 @xmath63 decays that originated from the lower lip of the collimator .",
