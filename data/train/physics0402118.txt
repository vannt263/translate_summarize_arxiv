    "can relativistic and quantum theories , these cornerstones of modern physics , actually fit together ?",
    "may quantum physics become , following by m.gell-mann @xcite , the real theory , but not `` an anti - intuitive discipline ... full of mysteries and paradoxes , that we do not completely understand , but are able to use ... limits , in which , as we suppose , any correct theory should be included '' ? + in spite of all successes of both relativistic and quantum theories , there are big `` clouds on the horizon '' @xcite in their correlation .",
    "a lot of experiments have confirmed these theories separately , but it looks like their backgrounds contradict to each other .",
    "for example , such effects as `` wave function collapse '' , epr - like effects contradict to the second postulate of einstein s relativistic theory @xcite .",
    "j.butterfield @xcite `` ... admits that the physics community at large does not worry so much about this cluster '' .",
    "but the physics community had worried about it so much before , from the beginning .",
    "a.einstein could not believe in the validity of quantum mechanics @xcite because of the epr - like effects .",
    "he has seen its incompatibility to the basic relativistic principles , which were confirmed experimentally . but",
    "further experiments @xcite also have confirmed the quantum mechanics conclusions .",
    "so , different experiments contradict to different theories , or more correctly to say that the physical backgrounds of these theories contradict to each other ! + there is more fundamental contradiction . from the special relativity point of view",
    ", the description of the quantum mechanical objects contradicts to the causal principle ",
    "the basic one in natural science , the background of our worldview .",
    "this is a very serious problem .",
    "it is not only physical , but philosophical , worldview question and that is why the physical community prefers to keep silence in this question , to keep all `` as is '' .",
    "the usual , `` official '' way to solve the problem in modern physics is do not solve it at all by declaring duality of particles , postulating uncertainty relations etc .",
    "the excuse is that on this level of investigation , the nature so differs from our everyday views that we can not even imagine it .",
    "do we know more than the ancient people explaining all events in nature by wills of their gods ? !",
    "i am sure , we need to search the answer , this is a way of science .",
    "the adepts of `` official '' views transform very easily `` can not imaging '' to `` may not '' . and",
    "this is quite dangerous , because science is transformed to religion .",
    "unfortunately , adepts of such views may be met at any level of `` the scientific hierarchy '' in physics , even at very high .",
    "such `` religious '' scientific communities may be really dangerous for investigators of this field of science .",
    "+ realizing all problems and difficulties mentioned above , we are going to introduce _ the space rotation theory _ ( srt ) .",
    "it seems to us , that this theory can overcome fundamental contradictions between the special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "as far as the worldview questions are involved , we will introduce the system of _ the physical reality description _ ( phrd ) from the srt point of view .",
    "after that , we will describe all involved to the phrd components : the sr frames of references ; the physical objects ( sr objects ) , which the srt operates with ; the physical laws and the space - time properties .",
    "we will analyze the correspondence between the space rotation theory with the special relativity , quantum mechanics and , briefly , with some modern theories .",
    "notwithstanding the incompatibility of the theory of special relativity and quantum mechanics , the possibility to coincide these theories , apparently , exists .",
    "it is based on the generalization , adaptation of the idea of relativity @xcite onto reference frames rotating in 3d - space .",
    "such adaptation bases on the idea of the equivalence of the sr frames .",
    "the equivalence is understood from point of view of constructing the system of the physical reality description .",
    "indeed , it concerns with not only the physical and mathematical questions , but also the philosophical , worldview ones . from the first view , it is well - known that physical laws are not invariant related to space rotations @xcite .",
    "the problem , however , may be brought to question : what really needs to be included into the system of the physical reality description ?",
    "it seems strange , but the revolution idea , which lets overcome contradictions mentioned above , is the idea to include the physical object by itself into this system .",
    "it means that in the physical space rotation theory the physical object `` perception '' may be changed in different sr frames .",
    "so , for example , the plane electromagnetic wave may be represented in the `` slow rotating '' frame as a set of the spherical waves @xcite .",
    "the rotating frame analysis in these works is limited by the case of `` slow rotating frames . '' in general , as it will be shown below , such a modification of the object `` perception '' in different sr frames may be more considerable and has a qualitative character @xcite .",
    "+ the idea of relativity introduced in special relativistic theory has changed our imagination about _ space - time properties _ , has declared the equivalence of the inertial _ reference frames _ from the point of an invariance of _ the physical laws _ in it . the new type of _ physical objects _ was introduced in quantum mechanics , that has caused the introducing of new postulates , new mathematical description , in other words , new _ physical laws_. these examples show us the interconnection between phrd components , so we can tell about the _ system _ of phrd .",
    "+ so , the components , we are going to include to the so - called `` system of the physical reality description '' are well known , but usually they were not used in `` system '' .",
    "we will consider that phrd consists of four interconnected components : _ the physical laws , physical objects , frames of references and space - time properties _ ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phrd ] ) . +    ( 450,100 ) ( 100,30)(120,30 ) ( 60,27)frame of references ( 100,80)(120,30 ) ( 70,77)physical laws ( 250,30)(120,30 ) ( 200,27)space - time properties ( 250,80)(120,30 ) ( 220,77)physical objects ( 100,45)(0,0)20 ( 160,30)(1,0)30 ( 250,45)(0,0)20 ( 160,80)(1,0)30 ( 157,40)(1,1)33 ( 157,70)(1,-1)33    unfortunately , there are no complete correspondence between quantum mechanical objects and laws with relativistic imagination of space - time properties .",
    "these `` clouds on the horizon '' are principal . in introduced terminology",
    "we can say that phrd s of special relativity and quantum mechanics do not correspond to each other .",
    "+ the special relativity idea of negation of the absolute reference frame leads to its logical extension .",
    "indeed , how to recognize the `` initial '' inertial frame ( or a system of inertial frames ) ?",
    "in other words : has the `` inertiality '' an absolute character , and if yes , but why ?",
    "the idea of relativity is `` selfextracting '' , so is needed to be continued or limited .",
    "such efforts to extract the idea of relativity to non - inertial frames ( but not rotating ones ) were made before .",
    "for example , a.logunov @xcite generalized the poincar s relativity principle @xcite in the form of : `` for any physical frame of references ( inertial or non - inertial ) , it is always possible to select the system of other frames , in which all physical processes are going similar to the initial frame , so we do not have and it is impossible to have any experimental possibilities to distinguish ",
    "what , exactly , frame from this infinite system we are in '' .",
    "+ the model of the local , material point ( or the point mass ) used for the physical object description in classical theories meets also the conceptual problems @xcite .",
    "we will also point to some additional problem on this way .",
    "we will call it the _ scale problem_. usually , the continuous space - time is considered in the relativistic theories . from the mathematical point of view , on this way , any local region in space - time has the same _ power of set _",
    "( by cantor ) as the whole space - time .",
    "it is not clear , why do we have some scale of the observed physical world .",
    "some additional postulates need to be introduced to fix the problem .",
    "one of the possibilities is the time or space discreteness .",
    "partially , the srt gives the answer to this question by explaining the so called visual discreteness .",
    "it will be described below in sect.[sec : law ] .",
    "+ from the introduced phrd point of view , the phrd of the quantum physics is not complete , and not compatible with the relativistic one .",
    "there are big problems in the relativistic phrd too .",
    "it was mentioned above in sect.[sec : phrd ] that the idea of relativity is `` self extracting '' , so should be continued or limited . as far as we want to extend it to space rotations , we need to declare the _ equivalence _ of the sr frames .",
    "so , we are introducing the basic principle of the space rotation theory  the principle of the equivalence of the rotating frames of references .",
    "the equivalence is considered from the point of view of creation of phrd .",
    "the `` mathematical '' rotating frames are equivalent to each other , but what does it mean from the physical point of view ? we will try to investigate this question here .",
    "we will consider three types of `` mathematical '' 3d - space rotations : the axis space rotation ( asr ) , the multiple space rotation ( msr ) and the sum space rotation ( ssr ) .",
    "+ we will call the space rotation ( sr ) of the @xmath0 frame of references related to @xmath1 in time @xmath2 with the frequency @xmath3 about some fixed space axis as an _ axis _ space rotation ( asr ) . we will also use notations : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a speed of light .",

    "the ssr transformations do not form a group . in distinguish to msr ,",
    "the ssr transforms the sphere in @xmath1 inside the full sphere in @xmath0 .",
    "the value @xmath23 is not constant and depends on @xmath2 .",
    "+ due to matrix properties , one can conclude that the transformation matrix of any space rotation with at least one common rotation point may be represented as a sum of products of the asr transformation matrices : @xmath24 the expression for the coordinate transformation without common rotation point one can get by replacing space coordinates @xmath25 by @xmath26 on the corresponding step , where @xmath27 is the origin coordinates displacement on this step .",
    "the first of all , the sr frames equivalence means that minkowski space - time can be built in any sr frame , so `` internal '' metrics can be introduced inside any sr frame . for some space rotation with the transformation matrix @xmath28 between @xmath1 and @xmath0 we will analyze the expression for `` interval '' in rotating frame @xmath0 in the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "together with the observed fourier expansion properties , the expr.([debroglie ] ) may have the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "in previous sections we have found some basic properties of the sr objects and sr frames .",

    "it means that sr frames on this infinite aggregate look like lorentz - invariant and so , we will consider , that they are _ measurable _ on @xmath142 .",
    "the frequency @xmath3 defines the _ scale _ between two frames of references @xmath1 and @xmath0 . on this approach , this parameter seems and needs to be very important in the physical object description in these frames .",
    "+ further , let s a physical object ( some of its property ) is described in @xmath0 by the function @xmath143 and in @xmath1 by function @xmath144 .",

    "so , it has a meaning of the sr function transformation .",
    "+ remind , that on @xmath142 : @xmath152 and we can consider @xmath158 .",
    "so , the lorentz invariant second order differential operator , called the dalembertian operator , will be invariant in frames @xmath1 and @xmath0 : @xmath159 we are able to apply the dalembertian operator to both parts of the eq.([psi ] ) .",
    "it will lead to equation : @xmath160 the third term right may be neglected in comparison with the second one in case of the stable particle , stable , at least , in comparison with the period of rotation @xmath161 : @xmath162 .",
    "if the physical object in @xmath0 ( it may be , for example , an electromagnetic wave ) is satisfied the equation @xmath163 , then supposing @xmath164 , one can get from ( [ kgf0 ] ) the _ klein - gordon - fock equation _ : @xmath165 the equation ( [ kgf ] ) is valid for any inertial to @xmath1 frames of references due to the lorentz invariance of the dalembertian operator , that was directly shown in @xcite .",
    "there was also shown the obtaining of the schrdinger equation in these papers , which is the non - relativistic approximation to the klein - gordon equation .",
    "as far as the @xmath3invariance gives the necessary symmetries , it is possible to obtain the dirac equation by the usual way @xcite .",
    "note , that ( [ n7 ] ) is not satisfied for ssr , so equations , created for ssr , apparently , will correspond to the qcd , qft equations .",
    "+ from the sr point of view , the equation ( [ kgf ] ) contains a new idea  an idea of connecting the physical object properties in different rotating frames of references .",
    "it is a consequence of the declared sr equivalence principle .",
    "+ we may conclude , that on numerable infinite aggregate @xmath142 ( discrete set ) , sr objects are both lorentz- and omega- invariant .",
    "so they looks like the quantum physics objects and also satisfy to special relativity .",
    "this principally coincide with the conclusion of v.petkov @xcite , about the work of a.anastasov @xcite of the possible `` structure '' of the quantum mechanics objects to correspond to the special relativity .",

    "+ @xmath35_the `` einstein s formula '' for the sr _ +",
    "the invariant @xmath166 given by the energy - momentum 4-vector of a particle @xmath167 in quantum mechanics corresponds to the kgf equation .",
    "an electromagnetic wave in @xmath0 gives for this invariant @xmath168 .",
    "for the stable and localized object in @xmath1 ( @xmath169 ) this invariant will be @xmath170 , so from ( [ kgf0 ] ) we can get the well - known einstein s formula : @xmath171 note that the `` influence '' of the sr object ( sect.[sec : object ] ) may be interpreted as an additional mass to ( [ e - mc ] ) , but it has another origin . here",
    "we can see some correspondence of the rotation frequency and the rest mass .",
    "this question needs to be analyzed in details , but not in this paper ( see also conclusions in sect.[sec : conclusion ] ) . +",
    "the equivalence principle of the space rotation theory leads to some new and interesting aspects of our understanding of space - time and its properties .",
    "+    * mathematically , any sr , considered in this paper , at any fixed time @xmath2 ( time is only a parameter of this transformation ) , transfers the @xmath172 space into itself . in special relativity time and space form a specific space - time as a whole , with own metrics and properties .",
    "that s why the uniform transformation in mathematics leads to some paradoxes in physics .",
    "we have seen above , that the `` physical space '' of @xmath0 consists of the internal , visible space and external , invisible one from the @xmath1 point of view .",
    "so , visible space of @xmath0 is included to the visible space of @xmath1 . because of the sr equivalence , considering @xmath1 from the @xmath0 point of view , one may conclude , that the visible space of @xmath1 is included to the visible space of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a physical paradox that may be considered as a new type of the space - time topology . *",
    "the considered sr intervals corresponds to the metric tensor with non - diagonal elements ( even averaged in time ) , so , generally , the rotating frames are immeasurable .",
    "the introduced omega  invariance hypothesis lets make them measurable , but , of course , with some limitations .",
    "these limitations are in a good agreement with the quantum physics postulates and paradoxes , that gives us some confidence on our way .",
    "we keep in mind that these limitations are coming from the sr theory ; they are not postulated or introduced .",
    "we may suppose , that `` new '' interactions , declared in quantum physics , such as strong or electroweak , are reflections of the `` usual '' forces , existing in rotating frames , to the observer frame .",
    "this is a way to the unification theory of these forces . *",
    "the correspondence of the sr object properties and quantum physics ones gives us another confidence of the legitimacy of the sr theory .",
    "for example , the quantification , spin etc .",
    "are essential parts of this theory , we do not need to declare something new , to introduce these object properties .",
    "as far as sr object is confined inside a very specific region ",
    "the horizon surface , some sr object characteristics , like spin for example , look like real `` internal '' , `` hidden '' parameters .",
    "it corresponds to real situation . also , the sr object types , we can imagine , are in a good agreement with known quantum physics objects .",
    "the quantification conditions correspond to the energy conservation law in the observer s frame .",
    "it is also object stability conditions . this way , such unstable elementary particles as resonancies may be interpreted as the sr objects , for which the quantification conditions could not be satisfied in time period , defined by @xmath3invariance .    at last",
    ", we would like to consider some philosophical consequences of the space rotation theory and its basic principle  the space rotation equivalence .",
    "after declaring this principle , one can ask a lot of questions , such as : are where an infinite set of `` parallel '' `` rotating worlds '' , and , if there are , so why do not we observe them in the everyday life and , is it possible , for example , to get to `` another world '' by rotating in centrifuge etc .",
    "+ @xmath35 _ rotating world . _ + the observer is connected with some phrd , so he is connected with all included components . if we consider a real man , as an observer , he is a part of the phrd and consists of the physical objects , existing in this phrd . on the other hand ,",
    "the observer creates the phrd , it is his product , as a child builds his own world after his birth .",
    "he builds his own `` projection '' of the real world . in another sr frame",
    ", it will be another physical objects , so the observer in one sr frame does not exist in other one as a physical object .",
    "but it does not mean that there are no any other `` observers '' in another sr frames .",
    "so , the question of existence of the `` parallel rotating worlds '' is open",
    ". it may be that our visible universe is only one projection of the real universe to our physical reality description system ( platon has said something similar long time ago ) .",
    "+ @xmath35 _ physical vacuum .",
    "_ + another possibility is that our universe is a result of a spontaneous symmetry breakdown ( in `` macro - scale '' ) of the real universe , so this symmetry is observable only in `` micro - scale '' , the scale of the elementary particles , vacuum etc .",
    "the difference between particles and vacuum is that physical vacuum is unrealized particles in observer s sr frame . in other words",
    ", vacuum looks like unstable particles that can not be identified as stable sr objects .",
    "such representation also coincides with modern understanding of the physical vacuum as a lot of virtual particles .",
    "+ we can observe the `` consistence '' of other rotating frames only in frames of @xmath3invariance , so all our experiments will give principally incomplete information .",
    "it seems that our attempt to create the system of the physical reality description applying to space rotations , undertaken in this paper , was successful enough and we may declare the result as a space rotation theory .",
    "the sr theory is based on the sr equivalence , the quantification principle and the @xmath3invariance hypothesis . + the sr equivalence principle is a generalization of the relativity principle by the extension it to the space rotation frames .",
    "it includes the special relativity principle as a particular case of the equivalence principle .",
    "also , the equivalence principle extends the conception of the space symmetry of the @xmath20 space rotation groups .",
    "this extended rotation group @xmath173 adds some very important physical characteristics to space - time and sr object descriptions .",
    "the stable - state objects , correlated with known quantum physics objects , are found .",
    "+ the quantification principle is based on the usual energy conservation law for found sr objects .",
    "it does not need any additional postulates to explain the quantum properties of existing particles and fields .",
    "+ the @xmath3invariance hypothesis makes sr frames measurable , but , of course , with some limitations .",
    "these limitations are coming from the sr theory ; they are not postulated or introduced .",
    "they are in a good agreement with the quantum physics postulates and paradoxes .",
    "+ from the srt point of view , quantum physics is an effort of the approximate description of the immeasurable sr systems , because in quantum physics the numerable infinite aggregate on @xmath2-axis is replaced by the continuous @xmath2-axis . at any , even very high values of @xmath3 , this approximation may be quite accurate , but always not complete .",
    "it looks like the reason of the _ uncertainties _ in quantum physics , its incompleteness and formalism .",
    "we may suppose , that `` new '' interactions , declared in quantum physics , such as strong or electroweak , are reflections of the `` usual '' forces , existing in rotating frames , to the observer s frame and also `` influence '' of the sr objects in our frame .",
    "this is a way to the unification of these forces .",
    "+ all these facts make us declare the `` initial '' , basic origin of the sr theory in comparison with the quantum physics . also , on other hand , the invariance of the special relativity looks like a particular case of the space rotation equivalence , the basic principle of srt .",
    "so , srt includes both special relativity and quantum physics basic principles , really let them fit together !",
    "+ we have not considered the general relativity in this paper , because it is not completely clear to us , what does gravitation mean from the srt point of view .",
    "but we believe that some correspondences mentioned above of rotation frequencies , potentials with the rest mass give us a way to further investigations of this question .",
