    "it is well established that when the paraxial approximation is valid , any electromagnetic beam with an azimuthal phase dependence of the form @xmath0 carries an orbital angular momentum @xmath1 per photon @xcite .",
    "interesting enough by itself due to its fundamental character , this fact also raises possibilities for technical applications .",
    "for example , in the rapidly developing field of quantum information , it has been pointed out recently that it is possible to increase the amount of information carried by a single photon by encoding qubits in the orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "laguerre - gaussian ( lg hereafter ) beams are the most known and studied examples of beams carrying orbital angular momentum .",
    "devices that discriminate the orbital angular momentum of laguerre - gaussian beams have been reported and experimentally tested for very low intensities , suggesting that they should work at the single photon level @xcite .",
    "an important potential application of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum is the generation of photon pairs with discrete multidimensional entanglement @xcite .",
    "this can be obtained by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) pumped by a lg beam . denoting by @xmath2 a one - photon state carrying an orbital angular momentum @xmath3 and by @xmath4 the azimuthal index of the the lg pump beam , the two - photon state generated by spdc can be written as @xmath5 this expression is based on the hypothesis that orbital angular momentum is conserved in spdc .",
    "some authors have studied this issue @xcite , and experimental results @xcite suggest that orbital angular momentum is in fact conserved .",
    "one has to consider , however , that although the process of down - conversion itself may conserve angular momentum , in most cases , the pump beam propagates in a birefringent nonlinear crystal as an extraordinary beam .",
    "the anisotropy of the medium causes a small astigmatism in the lg beam as it propagates , breaking its circular symmetry in the transverse plane .",
    "this symmetry breaking is equivalent to an exchange of angular momentum between the medium and the pump beam , so that the conservation holds only on average .",
    "this effect depends on both the angular momentum of the pump beam and on the crystal length , being negligible for thin crystals and low values of @xmath4 .",
    "a detailed account of this problem will be published elsewhere .    in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the phase matching conditions in spdc are responsible for a transfer of the amplitude and phase characteristics of the pump beam to the two - photon field .",
    "in fact , it is the plane wave spectrum , or the so - called angular spectrum of the pump beam that is transfered to the fourth - order spatial correlation properties of the down - converted field . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the conservation of orbital angular momentum as well as the multidimensional entanglement in the spdc process in the thin crystal paraxial approximation is a direct consequence of the transfer of the plane wave spectrum from the pump beam to the two - photon state . by means of a simple experimental setup based on fourth - order ( or two - photon ) interferometry",
    ", we show that our theoretical model provides a good description for down - converted fields carrying orbital angular momentum .",
    "in the monochromatic and paraxial approximations , the two - photon quantum state generated by non - collinear spdc can be written as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 are such that @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 depends on the crystal length , the nonlinearity coefficient , the magnitude of the pump field , among other factors .",
    "the kets @xmath11 represent one - photon states in plane wave modes labeled by the transverse component @xmath12 of the wave vector @xmath13 and by the polarization @xmath14 of the mode @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the polarization state of the down - converted photon pair is defined by the coefficients @xmath17 . the function @xmath18 is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the normalized angular spectrum of the pump beam , @xmath21 is the length of the nonlinear crystal in the propagation ( @xmath22 ) direction , and @xmath23 is the magnitude of the pump field wave vector .",
    "the integration domain @xmath24 is , in principle , defined by the conditions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , in most experimental conditions , the domain in which @xmath18 is appreciable is much smaller .",
    "if the crystal is thin enough , the sinc function in ( [ eq : state ] ) can be approximated by 1 .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 does not depend on the polarizations of the down - converted photons . in some cases ,",
    "this is not true , especially when one is dealing with type - ii phase matching , in which case the two photons have orthogonal polarizations .",
    "however , this dependence can be made negligible by the use of compensators in the down - converted beams @xcite .",
    "the two - photon detection amplitude , which can be regarded as a photonic wave function is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the field operator for the plane wave mode @xmath29 . in the paraxial approximation ,",

    ", we do not need to consider polarization .",
    "so , @xmath34 will be treated as a scalar function .",
    "in addition , we will work in the far field and make the following simplifications : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it is known that if the paraxial approximation is valid , the two - photon wave function is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normalized electric field amplitude of the pump beam and @xmath39 . in order to clean - up the notation ,",
    "we will omit the dependence on the @xmath22 coordinate hereafter .",
    "we see that the two - photon wave function @xmath40 carries the same functional form as the pump beam amplitude , calculated in the coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "the pump beam field @xmath42 is characterized by its wavelength @xmath43 and its waist @xmath44 . to be more precise , we will write @xmath45 as @xmath46 . since we are working with down - converted fields satisfying @xmath47 , it is convenient to write @xmath40 in terms of a beam with the same angular spectrum of the pump field , as required by eq .",

    "( [ eq : cdef ] ) : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "( [ eq : cdef2 ] ) , provided the order of the lg modes ( @xmath64 ) is not too large . in this case , the integral in @xmath65 is proportional to @xmath66 , that is , the convolution of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "numerical calculations show that in the worst case , that is , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , for a 1 mm - thick crystal , pumped by a laser with @xmath72 nm and a waist of @xmath73 mm , the mean square error is less than 1% for @xmath74 .",
    "since we are neglecting the effects due to the anisotropy of the crystal , as discussed before , there is no point in seeking exact solutions for large values of @xmath75 .    under the thin crystal approximation , eq .",

    "then , we have @xmath81 that is , @xmath82    thus , orbital angular momentum is conserved in the spdc process . in principle , this conservation could be satisfied by fields exhibiting either a classical or quantum correlation ( entanglement ) of orbital angular momentum .",
    "we will now show that the conservation leads to entanglement of orbital angular momentum of the down - converted fields .",
    "from ( [ eq : psif2 ] ) it is evident that , when @xmath83 , the biphoton wave function reproduces the pump beam transverse profile .",
    "let us assume that ( [ eq : psif2 ] ) ( with @xmath84 ) accurately describes the two - photon state from spdc and that the pump beam is a lg mode with @xmath85 .",

    "then , clearly @xmath92 and the coincidence detection probability @xmath93 satisfies @xmath94    now suppose that the down - converted fields exhibit a classical correlation that conserves orbital angular momentum .",
    "the detection probability @xmath95 for such a correlation can be written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent down - converted signal and idler fields with orbital angular momentum @xmath99 and @xmath100 per photon , respectively . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath101 satisfy @xmath102 and @xmath103 . now ,",
    "if ( [ eq : new3 ] ) accurately describes the two - photon state , then it must also satisfy the equivalent of ( [ eq : new2 ] ) : @xmath104 which gives @xmath105 since @xmath103 , a non - trivial solution to ( [ eq : new4 ] ) exists ( for the cases where at least one @xmath106 ) only if @xmath107 or @xmath108 for all @xmath109 , which implies that @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",

    "although direct coincidence detection provides information about the modulus of @xmath55 , its phase structure can only be revealed by some sort of interference measurement .",
