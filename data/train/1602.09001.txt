    "decentralized control is an essential feature in almost all large - scale networks such as the internet , surveillance systems , sensor networks , traffic and power grid networks .",
    "control in such networks is achieved in a distributed fashion by coordinating various actions and response signals of interest .",
    "communication between various parts of the network serves an effective means to establish coordination .",
    "there exist two modes of communication to enable the overall goal of coordination .",
    "* coordination of a system through _ explicit _ communication refers to settings in which communication signals extrinsic to the control and coordination of the system are sent from one part of system to another to specifically coordinate / control the system  @xcite . in this case , the signals used for communication are not part of the signals to be coordinated . *",
    "coordination of a system through _ implicit _ communication refers to scenarios in which the signals inherently sent from one part of the system to another in its natural operation are also used to coordinate / control the system  @xcite . in this case , some of the communication signals form a subset of the signals to be coordinated .",
    "the problem of coordination through ( either modes of ) communication is very closely tied to a slew of information - theoretic problems , including intrinsic randomness , resolvability , and random number generation  @xcite , channel resolvability , channel simulation and synthesis  @xcite , and distributed random variable generation  @xcite .",
    "consequently , many ideas for the design of codes for these problems heavily feature in the design of coordination codes .",
    "two notions of coordination have been studied in the literature :    * _ empirical _ coordination , where the aim is to closely match the empirical distribution of the actions / signals at network nodes with a prescribed target histogram / probability mass function ; and * _ strong _ coordination , where the aim is the generation of actions at various network nodes that are collectively required to resemble the output of a jointly correlated source . in this",
    "setting , by observing jointly the actions of the network nodes , a statistician can not determine ( with significant confidence ) as to whether the actions were generated by a jointly correlated source or from a coordination scheme .    a compendious introduction to the fundamental limits and optimal coding strategies for empirical and strong coordination in many canonical networks ( e.g. , one - hop , broadcast , relay networks )",
    "can be found in  @xcite . however , the majority of the networks considered therein comprised of two or and three terminals . the limits and means of the empirical coordination of a discrete memoryless source with a receiver connected by a point - to - point noisy channel",
    "was explored in  @xcite .",
    "the effects of causality of encoding and channel feedback were investigated in  @xcite , and the benefits of channel state information available acausally at the encoder was explored in  @xcite .",
    "coordination over the more general three - terminal setting in the presence of a relay was considered in  @xcite .",
    "inner and outer bounds of the required rates of communication for coordination were derived in  @xcite .",
    "note that  @xcite focuses on strong coordination and only one - way communication , whereas @xcite focuses on strong coordination and two - way communication with actions required only at the end terminals ( and not at the relay ) .",
    "inner and outer bounds for the required rates of communication for coordination over a noiseless triangular network with relay was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental limits and optimal schemes for empirical coordination with implicit communication over multiple - access channels with state were explored in  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we quantify the network resources required for achieving _ strong _ correlation in multi - hop line networks . by network resources , we mean three quantities required for establishing strong coordination : ( a ) the rates of hop - by - hop communication between network nodes ; ( b ) the rate of randomness locally available to each node ; and ( c ) the required rate of common randomness shared by all network nodes .",
    "this problem is closely related to those considered in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the strong coordination rate region for two- and multi - hop line networks is characterized under the secrecy constraint that an eavesdropper does not additionally learn anything about the joint statistics of the actions even when they observe the communication on the network links .",
    "this work does not consider this additional secrecy requirement .",
    "it presents a general achievability scheme that is proven to be optimal in the following cases :    * when there is sufficient common randomness shared by all the nodes in the network ; * when the intermediate nodes operate in a _",
    "functional _ regime in which intermediate - node processing is a deterministic function of the incoming messages and the common randomness alone ; and * when common randomness is absent , and the actions form a markov chain that is aligned with the network topology .",
