    "@xcite that the relation between noncommutative and commutative variables can be obtained by a linear transformation : @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfying the commutation relations as the usual commutative space .    a well - known result involving the spatial noncommutativity is the splitting on the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "other interesting result is the connection of the chiral oscillator with the noncommutative space , as was shown in ref .",

    "( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "some applications of the chiral oscillator , such as its connection with the electric - magnetic duality and the zeeman effect were then reported .    in another paper @xcite , the noncommutative versions of the klein - gordon and dirac oscillators were initially discussed . in both cases ,",
    "the relativistic equations of motion in a noncommutative space were determined and their similarities with those of a particle in a commutative space with a constant magnetic field have been reported .",
    "as claimed by the authors , in the case of a particle with spin the problem is not exactly soluble in three spatial dimensions .",
    "this fact , in the context of a perturbative treatment , opens the possibility of investigating the issue concerning the nonrelativistic corrections , induced by spatial noncommutativity on the energy spectrum of the system under consideration .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to answer the question whether such corrections are able to completely lift the degeneracy of the energy levels .",
    "the present work has as its main goal to examine the noncommutativity effects on the klein - gordon and dirac oscillators , with special emphasis to the nonrelativistic limit and possible modifications on the energy levels .",
    "our calculations are performed in the framework of the degenerate perturbation theory , by considering the @xmath0-modification as a first - order perturbation .",
    "we show that in both cases , the spatial noncommutativity is able to completely remove the degeneracy of the levels analyzed .",
