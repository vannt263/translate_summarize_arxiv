    "the expansion of the universe appears to have undergone a dramatic change in its recent past with most observations suggestive of the fact that cosmic expansion began to accelerate when the scale factor @xmath4 of the universe was about @xmath5 of its present value , i.e. at the redshift @xmath6 .",
    "although cosmic acceleration is a dramatic phenomenon , evidence for it is indirect and stems from data observed along our past light cone and involving either standard candles ( snia ) or standard rulers ( bao , cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the raison detre behind cosmic acceleration remains unknown and the fact that it might signal the need for new physics is partly responsible for the high levels of activity marking this field .",
    "possible drivers of acceleration range from the einstein s early suggestion of the cosmological constant @xcite to more elaborate constructions collectively called dark energy ( de ) which may equally well be based on the introduction of a new physical field ( physical de ) or on modifying the einstein general relativity ( gr ) ( geometrical de ) , or both @xcite . to distinguish between these widely varying alternatives , model independent diagnostic tools capable of differentiating different classes of de models are of great help @xcite . with this in mind",
    ", we introduced the @xmath0 diagnostic @xcite which successfully distinguishes evolving de from the cosmological constant on the basis of observations of the expansion history @xmath7 .",
    "the two - point @xmath0 diagnostic can be defined as follows om(z_2;z_1 ) = ,",
    "h(z ) = h(z)/h_0",
    "[ eq : om ] so that @xcite om(z;0 ) om(z ) =  . for a spatially flat universe",
    ", @xmath7 can be recovered from the luminosity distance via a single differentiation @xcite [ eq : h ] h(z)=^-1  , which makes @xmath7 more robustly determined than the equation of state [ eq : state ] w(x ) = ,  x = 1+z  , which involves knowing the second derivative of @xmath8 as well as the cosmological matter density @xmath2 .",
    "thus observational uncertainties in @xmath8 and @xmath2 muddy the reconstruction of @xmath9 to a much greater extent than @xmath7 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the expansion history , @xmath7 , can also be determined directly from ages of passively evolving galaxies @xcite , the time drift of the cosmological redshift @xcite , radial bao s @xcite or from a combination of the alcock - paczynski test and galaxy redshift space distortions @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of determining @xmath10 from a combination of data sets involving the low redshift universe ( @xmath11 ) , precisely where cosmic acceleration seems to have originated !",
    "the possibility of using @xmath0 as a _ null diagnostic _ follows from the fact that , for the cosmological constant om(z_2;z_1 ) = _ 0 m  .",
    "[ eq : lambdaom ] in other words , the value of @xmath0 is _ redshift independent _ for the cosmological constant , while for other models of cosmic acceleration @xmath10 is .",
    "this important property of @xmath0 can be used to considerable advantage by defining the _ difference diagnostic _ @xcite om_diff(z_1,z_2 ) : = om(z_1 ) - om(z_2 ) [ eq : om2 ] and the _ ratio diagnostic _",
    "om_ratio(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4 ) : =  .",
    "[ eq : om4 ] from ( [ eq : lambdaom ] ) one immediately finds that the following equalities must hold for the cosmological constant om_diff(z_1,z_2 ) = 0 ,   om_ratio(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4 ) = 1  .",
    "[ eq : defn1 ] a departure of @xmath12 from unity therefore serves as a ` smoking gun ' or _ null test _ for concordance cosmology : @xmath13cdm .",
    "if any two of the four redshifts in @xmath12 are identical then @xmath12 reduces to the _ 3 point diagnostic _",
    "@xmath1 om_ratio(z_1,z_2,z_1,z_3 ) : = om3(z_1,z_2,z_3 ) =  , [ eq : om3 ] where @xmath14 for @xmath13cdm.@xmath15 ( see @xcite for other discussions of the @xmath0 diagnostic . )    in this paper we focus on @xmath1 and show that the main difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is that these two diagnostics test the cosmological constant hypothesis using different cosmological observables . whereas @xmath0 is a powerful null diagnostic of the cosmological constant as it requires only a prior knowledge of the expansion history , @xmath16 , one should note that deriving @xmath16 directly from cosmological observables in a purely model independent and non - parametric manner is not always a simple task .",
    "although supernovae data do allow one to reconstruct @xmath16 in a model independent manner @xcite , deriving @xmath16 directly from large scale structure data seems to be considerably more difficult ( see  @xcite for detailed discussions ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 , the @xmath1 diagnostic is specifically tailored to be applied directly on baryon acoustic oscillation data , and depends on fewer cosmological observables than @xmath0 in this case .    combining bao information from the sdss , wigglez & 6df surveys with snia information from the union2.1 data set , allows us to determine the three point diagnostic , @xmath1 , at several independent redshift bins thereby placing robust constraints on the nature of dark energy .",
    "a key role in the determination of baryon acoustic oscillations is played by the ` dilation - scale ' distance @xcite d_v(z ) = ^1/3  ,  where  d(z ) : = =  , [ eq : dv ] and we have used @xmath17 to relate the luminosity distance @xmath8 to the angular size distance @xmath18 and also made the assumption that the universe is spatially flat .",
    "other important parameters which can be extracted from bao s include the acoustic parameter a(z ) = [ eq : a ] and the ratio d(z ) = where @xmath19 is the sound horizon at the epoch when cmb photons decouple from baryons .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dv ] ) allows us to relate the expansion history , @xmath7 , to @xmath20 and @xmath21 as follows h(z ) =  .",
    "independent measurements of @xmath20 and @xmath8 can therefore be used to reconstruct @xmath7 , as discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate that the _ ratio _ of the hubble parameter at two redshifts can play a key role in cosmological reconstruction . to see this note that h(z_i;z_j ) :",
    "= = ^2 ^ 3  , [ eq : frach1 ] equivalently h(z_i;z_j ) = ( ) ^2 ^ 2 ^ 3 = ^2 ^ 3  , [ eq : frach2 ] in other words , ratio s of bao parameters @xmath22 are related to the ratio of the hubble parameter . from ( [ eq : frach2 ] ) we find that @xmath23 does not depend either on @xmath24 , or even the cmb parameter @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore arrive at the following important result : the value of @xmath8 together with the value of _ either of _ the bao paramaters @xmath25 , determined at _ three independent redshifts _ , is sufficient to evaluate the @xmath1 diagnostic and",
    "define a null test of the cosmological constant hypothesis !",
    "this follows immediately from ( [ eq : om ] ) & ( [ eq : om3 ] ) , since , from the definition of @xmath1 in ( [ eq : om3 ] ) it follows that om3(z_1;z_2;z_3 ) = / ,  where  x = 1+z , [ eq : om3a ] where @xmath23 is determined using ( [ eq : frach1 ] ) or ( [ eq : frach2 ] ) .",
    "we should note that interchanging redshifts allows us to define different variants of @xmath1 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 should not be necessarily sorted in redshift ) .",
    "large galaxy redshift survey s including sdss , wigglez and 6dfgs have determined the bao parameters at several distinct redshift points @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall utilize these results to reconstruct @xmath1 , thereby obtaining useful constraints on the nature of dark energy .",
    "it should be stressed that the model independent method which we advocate does not rely on a knowledge of either the matter density @xmath2 or the hubble parameter @xmath3 .",
    "its scope and prowess is therefore likely to dramatically improve as new data is added to the burgeoning bao inventory by dedicated upcoming surveys such as boss @xcite , bigboss @xcite , j - pas @xcite and euclid @xcite .",

    "the background model is upgraded at each iteration step via @xmath41 and it is found that convergence is reached within a few steps , and that cosmological reconstruction is quite insensitive to the initial guess value @xmath40 , which is reassuring .",
    "one might note that cosmological reconstruction using the smoothing ansatz usually yields a better fit ( improved @xmath42 ) when compared with reconstruction using parametric methods @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of this method can be further enhanced by making the reconstruction error - sensitive via the substitution @xmath43 \\to \\left [ \\ln d_l(z_i)- \\ln \\ d_l^g(z_i ) \\right]/\\sigma^2_{d_l(z_i)}$ ] in ( [ eq : bg ] ) ; see @xcite for more details , and @xcite for other applications of the smoothing method .",

    "therefore , consists of finding three independently obtained values for the @xmath1 diagnostic constructed from ( [ eq : om3a ] ) & ( [ eq : frach2 ] ) and using the bao data in table 1 jointly with union 2.1 snia data .      in figure",

    "this property of @xmath1 serves as a null test of the cosmological constant hypothesis , since , if observations do indicate that @xmath1 evolves with redshift , then this would imply that @xmath58 for the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "we have shown that current bao and supernovae data are in agreement with standard @xmath13cdm , however the uncertainties on @xmath1 are still pretty high .",
    "this is mainly due to the quality of available bao data ( current bao data alone can not put tight constraints on the cosmological quantities  @xcite ) but future experiments , such as bigboss , can lead to much tighter determinations of @xmath1 .",
