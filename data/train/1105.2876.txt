    "in recent years , due to the relative simplicity and high efficiency in the generation , manipulation , and detection of optical continuous variable ( cv ) states @xcite , the corresponding entangled states have been successfully implemented in unconditional quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , and universal quantum computation @xcite among others . with the progress in the cv entanglement research ,",
    "the generation of more than a bipartite entanglement has attracted much attention .",
    "a truly @xmath1-partite entangled state generated by a single - mode squeezed state and linear optics @xcite along with the generation of cv tripartite entanglement using cascaded nonlinear interaction in an optical cavity without linear optics have been theoretically investigated @xcite and also experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of the entanglement for the three - mode system is a bit more subtle than that for a bipartite case , wherein , different classes of entanglement are defined based on how the density matrix may be partitioned @xcite .",
    "the classifications range from fully inseparable , which means that the density matrix is not separable for any grouping of the modes ( genuine tripartite entanglement ) , to fully separable , where the three modes are not entangled in any way . despite the challenge , fortunately , there is a large number of works that are aimed at devising ways of detecting a tripartite entanglement @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", there has been enormous effort in studying quantum optical systems that are capable of generating tripartite entangled light @xcite that includes the nondegenerate parametric oscillation and six - wave mixing in the nonlinear medium . as an alternative , the idea of generating a tripartite entanglement from various schemes of four - level atomic systems via coherent superposition has been under study recently @xcite . entangled photons from these systems",
    "are expected to have a potential applications in quantum memory @xcite and long distance quantum - communication @xcite , since the low frequency and narrow linewidth of the light can enhance efficient coupling between photons and atomic memories in a quantum network @xcite .",
    "some of the possible schemes include but not limited to @xmath2-type @xcite , @xmath3-type @xcite , cascade - type @xcite , and @xmath0-type @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the coherent superposition is induced by exciting an atom in a lower energy level to the upper ( using an external pumping mechanism ) from where the atom undergoes direct spontaneous emission that leads to a genuine tripartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "quite recently , shi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite extensively discussed the way of generating a tripartite entanglement applying a mechanism of six - wave mixing .",
    "the three external radiations they applied were believed to be responsible for creating the required nonclassical correlations .    however , in this contribution , following a similar kind of reasoning , it is proposed that the @xmath0-shaped four - level atomic scheme can be a reliable source of strong entangled light if the initial preparation of the atoms is assumed to be accountable for inducing coherent superposition . moreover , rather than placing the atoms in the cavity throughout the operation and expose them to thermal fluctuations , as usually the case , it is assumed that they are injected into the cavity at a constant rate . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "the amplification of the light due to reflection between the walls of the coupler mirror when photons with different frequency emitted in the forked four - level cascade transition are correlated by the coherence induced via initial preparation is dubbed as a nondegenerate @xmath0-shaped four - level correlated emission laser . since a large number of atoms , in principle ,",
    "can be injected into the cavity over a longer period of time and the direct spontaneous emission process can also be efficient , if the atoms are properly prepared initially , it would be reasonable expecting this system as a reliable source of bright light .    in order to study the dynamics of the entanglement employing the existing criteria ,",
    "it is found necessary and appropriate establishing the mathematical framework for solving the involved differential equations beforehand . to this effect , based on the involved structure of the atomic levels",
    ", the master equation is derived following the outline presented elsewhere for the corresponding two - mode case @xcite . due to the coherent superposition induced via initial preparation and cascading process , a significant correlation in the generated three modes is observed in the calculated master equation .",
    "moreover , with the intention of paving the way for in depth analysis , the procedure of solving the emerging coupled differential equations is outlined .",
    "it is found that the required solutions can be explicitly written down once the corresponding @xmath4 matrix constructed from the prefactors in the master equation is diagonalized and its eigenmatrix is constructed , which in principle is a surmountable task although the rigor may be somewhat lengthy .",
    "in earlier studies on the three - level cascade laser , it was observed that the spontaneous transition during the cascading process induces a coherent superposition that leads to enhanced quantum features including a bipartite cv entanglement @xcite .",
    "it can be asserted that initially preparing atoms in a certain coherent superposition and then allowing them to follow realistic spontaneous transition roots can yield a strongly entangled light @xcite . taking this as a motivation , the @xmath0-shaped four - level atomic system initially prepared in a coherent superpostion of the energy levels between which a direct electric dipole transition is forbidden",
    "would be considered . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "the lower energy level is denoted by @xmath5 , the intermediate energy level by @xmath6 , and the upper two energy levels by @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( please note that the schematic representation of the involved atomic energy levels is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in order to expedite the cascading process",
    ", it is assumed that the parity of the energy levels @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the same whereas that of @xmath6 is different .",
    "this entails that direct spontaneous transitions between energy levels @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath8 , @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath5 , and @xmath5 @xmath9 @xmath8 are electric dipole forbidden , but due to the parity difference , the transitions between @xmath6 @xmath9 @xmath5 , @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath6 , and @xmath6 @xmath9 @xmath8 are allowed .",
    "it is worth noting that if required the dipole forbidden transitions can be induced by an external pumping mechanism in a similar manner as in the three - level case @xcite .",
    "while the atom undergoes a direct spontaneous transition from energy level @xmath8 to @xmath6 , suppose it emits a photon represented by annihilation operator @xmath10 . in principle",
    ", it can still undergo a direct spontaneous emission and go over to the lower energy level @xmath5 ; in the process emits a photon described by @xmath11 . in the cascading transition from energy level @xmath8",
    "to @xmath5 via @xmath6 , a correlation between the two emitted photons ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) can readily be established . in a similar manner , it is not difficult to realize that there could be a correlation between the photons emitted ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) when the atom undergoes a spontaneous transition from energy level @xmath7 to @xmath5 via @xmath6 .",
    "these two processes , which are not entirely independent , are expected to initiate nonclassical correlations between the photons emitted while the atom cascades from the upper two energy levels to the lower via different forked roots . nevertheless , to establish a genuine tripartite entanglement as prescribed by the von loock and furusawa criteria",
    "@xcite , a correlation between the photons emitted from the upper two energy levels ( @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) is very crucial . in order to initiate this important correlation ,",
    "it is worth noting that in case the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of the upper two energy levels and the lower , it does not arbitrarily undergo the aforementioned spontaneous transitions due to the resulting population sharing .    if there is a triply resonant light in the cavity , the atom with energy level @xmath6 has three distinct alternatives to take except for the spontaneous decay to any other energy level that is not involved in the present consideration .",
    "the first and the most natural one is to continue with the direct spontaneous emission and then goes over to the lower energy level , or it can absorb a photon ( @xmath12 ) and excited to the upper energy level @xmath7 , or it can absorb a photon ( @xmath10 ) and excited to the upper energy level @xmath8 . in this description , if one manages to send a large number of initially prepared atoms through the cavity , the absorption - emission mechanism painstakingly follows different roots , which leads to additional correlation between emitted photons . in this scenario ,",
    "as long as there is a coherent superposition between the energy levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 initially , a meaningful correlation in a subsequent emission of photons denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath10 is expected .",
    "it is , hence , envisaged that this process can forge the required nonclassical correlation between the photons emitted from the upper two energy levels .",
    "the more general explanation and possible setup for practical utilization of similar schemes were provided earlier in refs .",
    "however , this contribution has one essential difference in which the initial preparation is assumed to be a prominent source of the atomic coherent superposition as opposed to the external pumping mechanism .",
    "although the initial preparation and injection process lead to some technical difficulties in practical utilization of the potential of this system , it is envisaged that the challenge would be less severe when compared to an external pumping mechanism that naturally initiates thermal fluctuations and atomic broadening .",

    "this indicates that the radiation emitted in the spontaneous transition between the lower two energy levels is not correlated with the corresponding upper two transitions .",

    "the way the atoms are initially prepared shows that coherently coupling the three atomic energy levels is very vital in generating a tripartite entangled light .",
    "it is unequivocally asserted that leaving one of the upper energy levels unpopulated at the beginning leads to a bipartite entanglement at best since there is no way for the atoms to go to the unpopulated level in the course of the process .",
    "however , initially preparing the atoms in the upper two energy levels other than in a possible maximum coherence leaving the lower energy level unpopulated can lead to the appearance of the tripartite entanglement since the upper two energy levels can be coupled to the lower via the cascade transitions .    in relation to the similarity of the result of preparing the atoms in the coherent superposition of the upper two energy levels with the corresponding three - level scheme",
    ", it is expected that an external driving mechanism can be used to improve the generated entanglement in some respect .",
    "furthermore , it may not be hard to realize that a highly intense light can be generated since the injection mechanism allows to send as many as required atoms through the cavity over a longer period of time without significantly exposing them to fluctuations and broadening associated with heating .",
    "hence , this study by and large tries to show that the nondegenerate @xmath0-shaped four - level scheme can be a source of reliable bright genuine tripartite entanglement with much more promise of flexible arrangement essentially by combining the initial preparation and external driving options . even though starting with the form of the master equation and the values of the involved prefactors yield encouraging outcomes , it is incontestable that in depth analysis is still lacking .",
    "owing to the involved rigor , length of the expressions , and complications of the different viable scenarios , a simpler and more specialized analysis is deferred to subsequent communications .",

    "i also acknowledge the valuable comments of klaus hornberger .",
    "in order to study the quantum features and statistical properties of the radiation , different auto - correlations , that refer to the pertinent mean photon numbers , and cross - correlations are required . in many instances , it is possible to obtain these correlations by making use of the master equation and then solve the resulting coupled differential equations . to this effect , employing eq . and the fact that @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an operator , the following essential correlations are obtained ( please note that the full list is unnecessarily long )",
