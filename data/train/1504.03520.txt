    "colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) encapsulate important properties of single or composite stellar populations .",
    "the most relevant are the age , metallicity , binary fraction and , perhaps , the initial mass function .",
    "these are followed by the foreground / background reddening , distance from the sun , differential reddening ( especially for embedded clusters ) , and even age spread ( for young clusters ) of the constituent stars .",
    "combined , these parameters contribute - in different degrees - to shaping and defining the cmd morphology of a star cluster . obviously , the definition of the evolutionary sequences of a single stellar population in a cmd increases with the number of member stars .",
    "a proper or robust determination of astrophysical parameters of star clusters is an important source of constraints for tracing the galactic structure and understanding its dynamics .",
    "fundamental parameters of young star clusters are important also for studies of dynamical state and cluster dissolution time scales ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , _ infant mortality ) phase in cluster evolution affected by significant disruption processes . ] _",
    "( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , star - formation rate in the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , among others .",
    "this kind of analysis started with @xcite and continues to date ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this context , the existence of methods to help in the extraction of parameters from cmds is fundamental .",
    "the simplest approach is to compare a given cmd with those built with stellar populations of previously known parameters .",
    "depending on the quality of the cmd ( basically , the definition of the evolutionary sequences ) , this exercise should yield relative values of the age , distance from the sun and metallicity . a more quantitative approach is trying to find one isochrone ( i.e. , a population of stars having the same age and metallicity but different masses ) that fits the overall cmd morphology of a star cluster . in principle , this can be - and has been - done _ by eye _ , but usually restricted to a small number of isochrones .",
    "this method is not practical for large sets of isochrones .",
    "however , a deeper interpretation of cmds in terms of intrinsic cluster properties such as mass , age , metallicity , binary fractions , etc , requires more than estimates or relative quantities .",
    "thus , several approaches have been built for extracting reliable parameters from cmds of star clusters .",
    "for instance , a bayesian technique to invert cmds of main - sequence and white dwarf stars has been introduced by @xcite and further developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite apply maximum - likelihood statistics to hess diagram simulations ( including binaries ) to derive distances from the sun and ages .",
    "however , they do not consider differential reddening , and their method appears to be more efficient for clusters older than @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite model cmds of star - forming regions and young star clusters by means of varying star - formation histories .",
    "@xcite include differential reddening , age spreads , and pre - main sequence stars to the @xcite method , but have to adopt distance from the sun and reddening values from previous works .",
    "@xcite use likelihood statistics to identify the synthetic cmd that best reproduces the observed one , with membership probabilities determined from comparison among cmds extracted from the cluster and a control field .",
    "more recently , @xcite simulated cmds including cluster ( stellar ) mass , age , distance modulus , star - formation spread , foreground and differential reddening , and binary fraction to reproduce the observed cmds of young star clusters .    in general , the above approaches are designed to provide a thorough description of the stellar population properties giving rise to an observed cmd .",
    "unfortunately , they usually invoke many free parameters and assumptions ; besides , they also tend to overlook some degree of degeneracy associated with , for instance , differential reddening , age spread and binaries .",
    "they also do not account for the fact that the low photometric completeness affecting mainly the faint ( low - mass ) stars - especially at the central region of populous star clusters - may mimic a flat mass function , thus leading to confusion between actual dynamical evolution and completeness effects .    in many - if not most - cases ,",
    "the interest is just to extract reliable values for the age , metallicity , reddening and distance from the sun of a star cluster , based only on the observed cmd and a set of isochrones .",
    "that s the perspective we ll explore in this work .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ approach ] we describe the new isochrone fitting approach . in sect .",
    "[ simcmds ] we test the parameter recovery efficiency with simulated cmds . in sect .",
    "[ realsc ] we apply the approach to actual star clusters and discuss the results .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "the first step of the approach consists in building the hess diagram from the photometric measurements of the observed stars in a given star cluster . as a compromise between resolution and computational time ,",
    "the hess diagrams used in this work are built with magnitude and colour cells of dimension @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . the smearing effect introduced by photometric uncertainties",
    "is explicitly considered in the hess diagrams . assuming that uncertainties follow a normal distribution around the mean values , we compute the magnitude and colour fraction ( summing for all stars ) that occurs in a given cell of the hess diagram . in practice",
    ", this value corresponds to the difference of the error functions computed at the cell borders .",
    "perhaps , this rather continuous nature is the most important advantage of hess diagrams over the discreteness of cmds . by definition ,",
    "the sum of the colour and magnitude density over all hess cells is the number of input stars .    in short ,",
    "the present approach consists in finding the isochrone ( or range of isochrones ) that best maps the high - density ridge occurring along the evolutionary sequences .",
    "quantitatively , this refers to the isochrone that crosses through the largest possible number of high - density cells in the hess diagram .",
    "this measure is quantified by means of the fit index ( ) , which contains the total hess - density sum of a given isochrone .",
    "specifically , for an isochrone ( characterized by a given age and metallicity ) displaced on the hess diagram by some amount of distance modulus and colour - excess , the fit index is quantified as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of magnitude points in the isochrone , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the magnitude and colour corresponding to the @xmath7th isochrone point , and @xmath8 is the respective hess density .",
    "additionally , this procedure naturally leads to lower values of  for secondary sequences ( i.e. lower - hess density ) occurring in , e.g. high binary fractions .",
    "given the wide - range coverage in age , metallicity , and mass - and the relative simplicity in obtaining them - we work here with the parsec isochrone set ( @xcite ) , version 1.2s . these isochrones are computed for a scaled - solar composition and follow the relation @xmath9 .",
    "they consider the solar metal content as @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that our approach works with any isochrone set , as long as the isochrones cover the ranges of age , metallicity and stellar mass expected to occur in star clusters .",
    "regarding ages and the total metal content @xmath11 , we consider isochrones distributed within @xmath12 and ages in the range @xmath13 , with higher resolution both for lower metallicity and younger ages . in summary , we work here with a base of 2808 isochrones . for clarity , the distribution of isochrones on the @xmath14age plane",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "obviously , the approach can be equally used with the full or restricted ranges of metallicity and age .",
    "once the metallicity and age ranges are selected , each isochrone belonging to those ranges is used to search for the values of apparent distance modulus ( dm ) and colour excess ( ce ) that produce the best fit to the hess diagram . in the present context , a fit represents the density sum over all hess cells crossed by the isochrone ( see eq .",
    "the search ranges for dm and ce must also be given at the start .",
    "thus , our procedure reduces to two the dimensionality of the problem , i.e. , finding the best values of dm and ce .",
    "this might lead to losing some information on the error propagation in both parameters .",
    "however , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ simcmds ] , the final errors in dm and ce ( and the remaining parameters ) are computed based on the morphology of the plane z@xmath15age as a function of . the search for the best values of dm and ce is carried out by the global optimisation method known as adaptive simulated annealing ( asa ) , which is relatively time efficient and robust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "asa is able to distinguish and escape from different local maxima in its search for the absolute maximum ( e.g. @xcite ) .    as a technical caveat , we remark that an isochrone is a discrete set of stellar mass , magnitudes and colour values .",
    "but , by construction , the number - and consequently , distribution - of these points is not the same for all isochrones .",
    "so , isochrones having a higher number of points would naturally end up being favoured by the present approach . to avoid this",
    ", each isochrone is regularised at the start , so that the line connecting 2 consecutive isochrone points is discretised with the same spacing as that adopted for the hess cells ; additionally , each cell crossed by an isochrone is counted a single time .",
    "the end result of applying the above procedure to all isochrones ( belonging to the selected age and metallicity range ) is the solution map , which contains the fit index for all values of @xmath11 and age . for visualisation purposes ,",
    "this map is first normalised by the  corresponding to the best solution . then",
    ", the map resolution is increased by means of a bi - cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the latter step is necessary to find the significant solutions and compute their uncertainties ( sect .",
    "[ simcmds ] ) . in the context of the present work",
    ", a solution would correspond to a region ( hot - spot ) in the map where the highest values of  are concentrated .",
    "then , the optimum values of age , metallicity , apparent distance modulus , and colour excess ( and , consequently , distance from the sun ) can be derived from the hot - spot morphology .",
    "in this section we employ simulated cmds to investigate the efficiency of our approach in retrieving the input values of relevant astrophysical parameters under very different numbers of stars .",
    "the model cmds correspond to relatively old star clusters with total stellar masses of 250(model#1 ) and 10000(model#2 ) , located at 1.1kpc from the sun . for the sake of realism , we assume that at this distance , b and v photometry obtained with typical ground - based telescopes would reach apparent magnitudes @xmath16 still with relatively small errors .    for consistency with the remainder of this work , photometric errors at given b and v magnitudes are simulated following the average error distribution as a function of magnitude observed for the star clusters m67 , ngc6791 and ngc2635 ( sect .   [ realsc ] )",
    ". formally , for stars fainter than @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the corresponding photometric uncertainties are computed according to @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; brighter stars have @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the simulated stellar mass distribution follows a @xcite mass function , with each star being attributed b and v magnitude values according to its mass .",
    "the mass / light relation was extracted from a specific parsec isochrone built according to the bessell & brett ( @xcite ; @xcite ) photometric system .    except for the total stellar mass ,",
    "the models are identically built with the isochrone corresponding to 3.5of age and total metallicity @xmath23 ; additional model parameters are the colour excess @xmath24 , and the binary fraction @xmath25 . at 3.5",
    ", the corresponding isochrone contains stars in the mass range @xmath26 . for more realism",
    ", photometric errors and scatter are also added to the stars . models#1 and # 2 end up having @xmath27 and @xmath28 stars brighter than @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the difference in number of stars , as well as the restricted photometric range , are useful for testing the efficiency of the approach under different morphology definition of the evolutionary sequences on the corresponding hess diagrams .    to test the approach we considered all isochrones having age and metallicity within the ranges @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( top panels ) shows the normalised , high - resolution solution maps for the three models .",
    "clearly , the convergence pattern on the age@xmath15metallicity plane gets tighter as the number of stars ( and so , the definition of the evolutionary sequences on the hess diagram ) increases , which should be reflected both on the number of secondary solutions and the scale of the fit parameter uncertainties ( see below ) .",
    "as expected , the best solution corresponds to the point with the highest  in the map . after locating it",
    ", we fit the map with a two - dimensional gaussian , with axes along the @xmath11 and age directions ; the values of age and @xmath11 at the maximum  are kept fixed .",
    "the free parameters , the gaussian amplitude together with @xmath11 and age dispersions ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are searched again with asa .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are taken as the global uncertainties of @xmath11 and age .",
    "this gaussian is subsequently subtracted from the map , and the new ( if any ) maximum is searched for , thus giving rise to a set of solutions ranked by the respective .",
    "each solution corresponds to a single value for dm and ce .",
    "then , considering all solutions occurring within @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we compute the weighted ( using  as weight ) average and @xmath36 dispersion for both dm and ce . as a caveat we remark that , although this approach has the advantage of allowing the detection and characterization of multiple solutions , the  morphology around the solutions in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] clearly deviate from a simple gaussianity .",
    "the extent to which the deviation affects the parameter uncertainties and alternative approaches for finding errors will be explored in forthcoming work .",
    "the simulated cmds and respective hess diagrams are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( middle and bottom panels ) , together with the isochrones and parameters corresponding to the best solutions .",
    "since the optimum @xmath11 and age are searched for on the interpolated , high - resolution map , the numerical values returned do not necessarily coincide with those of the input isochrones .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained in the simulations are given in table  [ tab1 ] , where we restrict to solutions having @xmath37 .",
    "reflecting the low number of stars and , thus , less constrained cmd ( and hess diagram ) morphology , model#1 has 3 solutions with @xmath37 .",

    "tests with simulated cmds show that our approach is efficient in recovering the input parameters and providing reasonable uncertainties .",
    "at this point we test our approach with actual star clusters . for this exercise we selected the relatively old open clusters m67 ( ngc2682 ) and ngc6791 , and the younger ngc2635 .",
    "they were selected for having relatively recent and uniform ccd photometry easily accessible through * vizier*. in addition , they are characterised by different ages , metallicities , number of stars , distances from the sun and amount of field - star contamination .",
    "both m67 and ngc6791 are older and closer to the sun and , perhaps , more populous than ngc2635 .",
    "one consequence is that both older clusters produce clearly discernible evolutionary sequences in cmds or hess diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "ngc2635 , on the other hand , has a more ambiguous ( less populated and more contaminated ) cmd morphology .",
    "thus , these three clusters provide some variety of conditions for testing our approach .",
    "the high galactic latitude of m67 ( @xmath82 ) is an advantage for minimising field - star contamination , which makes it a convenient cluster for this analysis .",
    "several works have come up with a nearly solar metallicity for m67 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the * webda * database provides @xmath83kpc , @xmath84 , and the 2.6of age .",
    "more recently , the study of @xcite assumed @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , with which they derived the significantly older value of 3.5as the the most probable age of m67 .",
    "our cmd of m67 consists of b and v photometry taken from the ground - based ccd astrometry catalog of @xcite .",
    "we selected stars lying closer than 20  from the cluster center , thus resulting in 446 stars brighter than @xmath88 .",
    "as expected , the evolutionary sequence of a relatively old open cluster stands out clearly in the cmd and hess diagram , with a minimum field contamination ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "solutions have been searched for isochrones having age within @xmath89 and metallicity within @xmath90 .",
    "our approach finds 2 solutions having @xmath37 for m67 .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab1 ] , and the corresponding solution maps , hess diagrams and cmds are shown in fig .",
    "the solution map pattern shows a rather tight distribution of ages around @xmath91 , but the metallicity distributes over the relatively wide range @xmath92 . within the uncertainty ,",
    "the age we find for m67 - corresponding to the best fit - is nearly the same as that found by @xcite , but our metallicity is about half theirs .",
    "the second - ranked solution is rather consistent in age , but presents an increase in metallicity .",
    "interestingly , the isochrone fit adopted by @xcite is recovered by our approach as the second - ranked solution , with @xmath93 . for comparison purposes , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the two solutions superimposed to the cmd and hess diagram of m67 .",
    "ngc6791 is closer to the galactic plane ( @xmath94 ) and somewhat older and metal richer than m67 .",
    "for instance , webda gives @xmath95kpc , @xmath96 , 4.4 , and @xmath97 for ngc6791 .",
    "more recently , @xcite ( and references therein ) use @xmath98\\sim0.3 $ ] ( thus implying @xmath99 ) and derive an age of @xmath100 for ngc6791 .",
    "the b and v photometry for ngc6791 was taken from the ccd catalogue of @xcite . to minimise field - star contamination , we only considered stars closer than 3  from the center and brighter than @xmath101 , resulting in @xmath102 stars .",
    "even so , the cmd and hess diagram of ngc6791 clearly contain some degree of field contamination ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "solutions were searched within the same age and metallicity ranges as for m67 .",
    "we find 4 solutions having @xmath37 for ngc6791 , and they all consistently confirm its older age with respect to m67 , probably reaching 8 . regarding the metallicity , the highest - ranked solutions indicate @xmath103 , but with a value as low as @xmath23 with a low probability .",
    "thus , the metallicity appears to be higher than solar , probably reaching nearly twice the solar value ( table   [ tab1 ] ) . these features ( i.e. the relatively narrow age range associated with some dispersion in metallicity ) are present in the solution map .    the three best - fit parsec isochrones produce an excellent description of the entire evolutionary sequence of ngc6791 .",
    "however , the difference in  among the first three solutions is rather small , which means that they are statistically significant as well .",
    "the weighted average of the 4 solutions ( using the respective  as weight ) yields the age @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107kpc . an age between 7.5and 8 ( in our case derived for most of the main sequence and rgb@xmath108agb stars ) is consistent with the value obtained by @xcite based on properties of the white dwarf cooling sequence of ngc6791 .      located in the third galactic quadrant and at @xmath109 , the field of ngc2635 is naturally more contaminated than both of m67 and ngc6791 .",
    "combined with a large distance from the sun and a small population , the available cmds of ngc2635 lead to somewhat discrepant values of its fundamental parameters .",
    "for instance , webda provides @xmath110 of age , @xmath111kpc , and @xmath112 .",
    "@xcite employ ccd broad band photometry and cmds to find @xmath113myr of age @xmath114kpc , @xmath112 , and the very - low metallicity @xmath115 for ngc2635 .",
    "photometry for ngc2635 was taken from the ccd broad band ubv catalogue of @xcite , via * vizier*. because of the previous evidence of a younger age and lower metallicity ( with respect to m67 and ngc6791 ) , solutions have been searched for isochrones with age within @xmath116 and metallicity within @xmath117 .",
    "the cmd and hess diagram of ngc2635 clearly reflect its small stellar content ( e.g. the rather discrete distribution of stars along the main sequence ) and unaccounted - for field - star contamination .",
    "nevertheless , our approach indicates @xmath118myr as the most probable age for ngc2635 , together with the low metallicity of @xmath115 .",
    "interestingly , this age corresponds to the average between those of webda and @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity , reddening , and distance from the sun agree with those of @xcite .",
    "the best - fit isochrone passes through the main sequence and a group of relatively red and bright stars that - in this case - would correspond to giants ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it s obvious that , if some field - star contamination is present among the giants , the end result of the age may change , but still probably within the @xmath119 uncertainty derived by our approach .",
    "nevertheless , the  map shows that age and metallicity are quite concentrated around @xmath120 and @xmath115 .",
    "finally , we note that the fit index patterns in the solution maps of m67 and ngc6791 present a high degree of similarity . basically , they are relatively constrained in age but somewhat wide in metallicity , which explains the @xmath11-distribution among the solutions for m67 and ngc6791 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the apparent degeneracy in metallicity associated with isochrones - especially the old ones - is a clear example of the difficulties related to deriving precise values of @xmath11 from photometry .",
    "ideally , isochrones covering a wider range of wavelengths - especially towards the blue / violet - should mitigate this degeneracy and , as discussed in previous sections , our approach is designed to work with any isochrone set .",
    "however , isochrones built with blue filters usually do not yet have the same accuracy as those in b and v in describing observed evolutionary sequences in cmds .",
    "this occurs especially because of the lack of a robust determination of molecular opacities , incorrect bolometric corrections and colour-@xmath121 relations , and incomplete convection description , mostly related to low-@xmath121 .",
    "this issue is explored and highlighted , for instance , in @xcite , and references therein .",
    "in this paper we describe a relatively simple and direct approach designed to extract astrophysical parameters ( specifically the age , metallicity , foreground reddening and distance from the sun ) from cmds of star clusters .",
    "central to the approach is the availability of isochrone databases covering wide ranges - and with a high resolution - in age and metallicity .",
    "for this reason , we work here with the parsec ( @xcite ) isochrone database , but any comprehensive ( in terms of age and metallicity ) isochrone set should work as well .",
    "the basic idea is to search for the isochrone that best maps the high - density regions of the hess diagram corresponding to the input cmd .",
    "this is accomplished by varying the apparent distance modulus and reddening for each isochrone . at each step , the fit index ( ) corresponding to the sum of the hess density spanned by the isochrone is computed .",
    "the best values of distance modulus and reddening are those that lead to the highest possible  for each isochrone .",
    "finally , a map of  is produced on the age@xmath15metallicity plane , in which the solutions and uncertainties are searched for .",
    "tests with simulated cmds show that the approach is efficient in recovering the input values .",
    "obviously , convergence ( and uncertainties ) depends somewhat on the hess diagram morphology .",
    "star cluster cmds containing large number of member stars tend to produce well - defined evolutionary sequences in hess diagrams .",
    "this , in turn , increases convergence of the approach and decreases the uncertainties in the retrieved parameters .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it s clear that our approach depends critically on the accuracy of the isochrones in describing the stellar evolutionary sequences at a given age and metallicity .",
    "right now this is a minor issue , because several groups are actively working on the development of isochrones based on state - of - the - art stellar physics .",
