    "optical identification of sources detected in deep x - ray images , particularly from the satellite , have , in recent years , proved a highly successful probe of the origins of the soft cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been seen that at bright fluxes , the major class of contributors is qsos . however , they are unlikely to contribute more than @xmath050% of the x - ray background at 1kev @xcite and , even were their contribution to increase greatly beyond the limits of current surveys , their characteristic x - ray spectrum is too soft to match the residual xrb @xcite .",
    "deeper x - ray surveys , however , are showing that at fainter fluxes , there is a new class of galaxies with narrow optical emission lines ( nelgs ) which have suitably hard x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "the deepest x - ray survey yet optically identified is the uk deep survey .",
    "this reaches a depth of @xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ( 0.5 - 2kev ) and is described in detail in .    within the `` complete '' sample area defined by , there are eleven unidentified sources ( out of a total of 70 sources ) . of the unidentified sources ,",
    "most ( 7 ) remain unidentified because adequate optical spectra have not been obtained for all likely candidates .",
    "however , for four of the x - ray sources there are no optical candidates brighter than @xmath7 .",
    "this is a puzzle since they are not primarily the faintest x - ray objects in the survey .",
    "one possibility is that the source of the x - rays are obscured agn  ",
    "long proposed as a contributor to the xrb ( see for example ) .",
    "the discovery of such objects would have important implications for the origin of the hard x - ray background .",
    "the x - rays could also be coming from distant clusters of galaxies , which can have high x - ray to optical luminosity ratios ( see , for example , ) .",
    "other possibilities include further nelg objects or very high redshift qsos , where the bright ly@xmath8 emission has been redshifted out of the r - band .",
    "all of these classes of objects , particularly the obscured agn , will have red optical / infra - red colours , so in 1996 we performed deep k - band imaging at ukirt of the four ` blank ' deep survey fields to identify candidate objects and try to determine their nature .",
    "the results of this imaging are presented in this paper .    in section  [ sec : survey",
    "] we briefly describe the x - ray and optical data that make up the deep survey , in section  [ sec : irdata ] we present the k - band images and in  [ sec : ident ] , we consider possible scenarios .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the possible significance of the results .",
    "the uk deep survey is a total of 115 ksec of position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observation of ra  @xmath9 dec  @xmath10 ( j2000 ) divided between two exposures    in june 1991 @xcite and june / july 1993 .",
    "this region of sky was selected because of its extremely low obscuration    @xmath11 . using these data ,",
    "sources were identified at more than 3.5@xmath12 significance down to @xmath13 .",
    "optical ccd images of the inner 15 arcmin radius of the rosat field taken at the university of hawaii 88inch telescope were then used to find potential optical counterparts and subsequent spectroscopy has enabled identification of the sources in a statistically complete subsection making up about 80% of the 15 arcmin survey area down to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the majority of these sources are identified with qsos , nelgs and galaxy clusters , and a small number with stars . however , of interest in this paper are four x - ray sources where the initial ccd imaging revealed no candidates within @xmath15 arcsec of the x - ray position brighter than @xmath16 .",
    "all four of these sources are towards the fainter flux end of this sample ( ie @xmath17 ) .    however , even down at these faint limits , we have found from the offsets between the optical and x - ray positions of identified sources as shown in figure  [ fig : offsets ] , that we would still expect the optical counterpart of the faintest of these sources to be within @xmath18 arcsec of the position ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the source searching in the deep survey was based on the cash statistic @xcite and is described in more detail in and .",
    "simulations showed that for sources detected at greater than 3.5@xmath12 significance , the survey is complete above a flux limit of 1.8 @xmath19 10@xmath20 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , even the faintest of the sources ( r130    see table  [ tab : candidates ] ) is detected at @xmath21 3.5@xmath12 .    in march 1995 ,",
    "the whole 15 arcmin radius survey region was again imaged in the r band to a greater depth , using the university of hawaii 8k@xmath198k ccd array @xcite on cfht with a 1 hour exposure .",
    "this image revealed some possible optical candidates in two of the fields at r@xmath023 , but nothing of note ( ie r@xmath2224 ) in the other two ( see the right hand panels of figures  [ fig : r73_piccies ] to  [ fig : r130_piccies ] ) .",
    "the k - band images were obtained in one night in may 1996 at ukirt using the ircam3 camera .",
    "the images in figures  [ fig : r73_piccies ] through  [ fig : r130_piccies ] were formed from multiple 9-point mosaics    hence the loss of quality towards the edges where fewer of the sub - images overlap .",
    "total exposure times range from just over 20 mins to 1 hour ( see table  [ tab : kimage ] ) .",
    "initial reduction was performed at the telescope using the ircam3_clred package , but the final images given here were re - reduced in iraf using purpose - built codes .",
    "the seeing for the night was just greater than 1 arcsec and the pixels are 0.286 arcsec ( the original k - band ircam3 images were 256@xmath19256 pixels , the mosaics created are 311@xmath19311 pixels ) .    the four k - band images are given in the left hand panels of figures  [ fig : r73_piccies ] to  [ fig : r130_piccies ] , the right hand panels being the deepest available r - band images of the same areas for comparison .",
    "it should be noted that exposure times vary from image to image , and the grey - scale shading of each has been chosen individually for each image for clarity .",
    "direct visual comparisons _ between _ the different k - band images should not , therefore , be made .",
    ".the details of the k - band images in figures  [ fig : r73_piccies ] to  [ fig : r130_piccies ] .",
    "the limiting magnitudes refer to the central 140@xmath19140 pixel square region where all the images in the 9-position sampling pattern overlap .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using the bcg calibration and k - corrections from we obtain the estimated redshifts and x - ray luminosities found in table  [ tab : bcg ] . estimated redshifts for the four objects are between 0.8 and 1.1 , with @xmath23 values all around @xmath24 erg sec@xmath6 .",
    "other clusters and galaxy groups in the survey have @xmath25 $ ] between 42 and 43.5 erg sec@xmath6 so all the candidates in the blank fields are compatible with these . in addition , from we find that model galaxy spectra of elliptical galaxies give r - k colours of @xmath05 at @xmath26 up to @xmath06 at @xmath27 which , given the scatter that is seen around the model value , is again consistent with the r - k values found for all the candidates ( refer to table  [ tab : candidates ] ) .",
    "therefore , a @xmath3 galaxy cluster origin can not be ruled out for any of the blank fields .",
    "typically , agn have fairly blue r@xmath1k colours of @xmath28 , rarely going above 3 ( see , for example , figure  2 ) .",
    "therefore , the very red colours of the candidate objects found , particularly of r82 , r112 and r130 , would seem to exclude agn as the source of the x - rays .",
    "however , such colours might be seen in agn under some circumstances .",
    "for example , it is possible that this colour is a result of a very high redshift . at @xmath29",
    ", ly@xmath30 passes out of the r band , giving a very red colour .",
    "this would make all four of the sources by far the most x - ray luminous in the deep survey .",
    "while this is not impossible , it is unlikely to be the case for all four sources and so , perhaps more realistically , we should consider the possibility of intrinsic reddening .",
    "it has frequently been suggested that obscured agn could contribute a significant part of the xrb at a large range of energies , not just the soft x - ray band ( eg  ; ) . the recent discovery by (; see also ) of an x - ray source with narrow optical emission lines , but a broad ir @xmath31 has provided a probable member of this class of object .",
    "the object ( object rxj13434 + 0001 is also reddened with r@xmath1k@xmath32 and an @xmath33 of @xmath0 0.45 in the same units as table  [ tab : candidates ] ) .",
    "this is similar to object r82 and r130 could be an even more highly obscured agn .",
    "the amount of reddening required to give the observed colour will depend to some extent upon redshift .",
    "for example , to produce an observed r@xmath1k colour of 6 for an object with an intrinsic colour of 2 requires an @xmath34 column of @xmath35 at a redshift of @xmath36 .",
    "( for this and subsequent calculations we assume a dust to gas ratio of @xmath37 taken from ) .",
    "this would take the intrinsic of r130 down to @xmath38    far too low for an extra - galactic object . on the other hand , the same observed colour for an object at @xmath39 would need @xmath40 which gives an intrinsic for r130 of only -1 , which although low is certainly acceptable for an agn ( see figure  [ fig : lxlopt ] ) .    for objects r82 and r112 a lower column is required to produce the observed r@xmath1k colours .",
    "a distance of @xmath41 would be reasonable to produce an intrinsic suitable for an agn with an @xmath34 of between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "alternatively , we could be looking at bl lacs .",
    "these have redder colours than other agn , typically in the range @xmath44 ( eg ) and high values ( see figure  [ fig : lxlopt ] ) .",
    "therefore , only the r@xmath1k of 6.1 for r130 is too red .",
    "however , bl lacs should be detectable in the radio , but deep 20 cm and 6 cm radio observations of the deep survey region at the very large array ( vla ) show no signs of radio sources down to the detection limit ( @xmath45 mjy ) for any of the four blank fields .",
    "we have used deep k - band imaging to attempt to identify the optical candidates of four faint x - ray sources with ` blank ' optical fields ( ie nothing within @xmath15 arcsec of the x - ray centroid with r@xmath2223 ) . of the four fields ,",
    "firm candidates have been found in three .",
    "the remaining field ( object r112 ; figure  [ fig : r112_piccies ] ) shows a collection of similar , red objects in the vicinity of the x - ray centroid .",
    "no firm conclusions about the nature of the candidates can be achieved with just the current photometric data but we have , nevertheless , been able to draw tentative conclusions .",
    "of the four x - ray sources , r73 has the least red candidate .",
    "in fact , both its r@xmath1k colour ( 3.2 ) and x - ray to optical luminosity ratio are entirely consistent with the narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) found in significant quantities at the fainter end of the uk deep survey @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , both r112 and r130 have candidates that are redder than in r73 ( r112 has an r@xmath1k of 4.2 , r130 has r@xmath1k of 6.1 ) .",
    "these objects are probably better described by high redshift ( @xmath3 ) galaxy clusters , the candidates having absolute magnitudes , r@xmath1k colours and ratios consistent with typical @xmath3 brightest cluster galaxys ( bcgs ) .",
    "the collection of red objects in r112 also supports this conclusion .",
    "the candidate object for source r82 also is also consistent with being a distant brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "however , in this case both the deep r and k - band images show an apparently point - like object .",
    "it may therefore also be explained as a distant ( @xmath46 ) intrinsically reddened agn .",
    "if this is the case , with this deep observation , and others like it , we are just starting to see the tip of the iceberg which has been proposed as a significant contributor to the cosmic x - ray background , not just in the soft band , but over a wide range of energies ( eg  ) .",
    "future observations will be required to confirm these tentative identifications .",
    "in particular , infra - red spectroscopy over a range of wavelengths would enable one to search for broad , redshifted emission lines characteristic of qsos ( a qso with a redshift of @xmath46 would have h@xmath8 redshifted into the h or k band ) .",
    "further ir photometry in other bands to give ir colours may also prove a useful diagnostic and deeper imaging with good seeing would allow spatial extension to be seen if any of the objects are nelgs or moderate redshift clusters ( ie  @xmath47 ) .    deep ir imaging , therefore , has shown itself to be a powerful tool in the study of the faintest x - ray sources . in all four of the optically blank fields containing x - ray sources which we have observed in the k - band , firm candidates have been found .",
    "in addition , consideration of the photometric and x - ray properties of the candidates has enabled us to make preliminary identifications of the types of objects producing the x - ray emission , and possibly identified an obscured qso    a much hypothesised but little observed contributor to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "thanks to tom marsh for discussions about possible galactic identifications and to the referee for his encouraging comments .",
