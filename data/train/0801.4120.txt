    "nanoelectronics , or molecular electronics , have been proposed as the alternative to silicon in future technical applications@xmath0 and have attracted much interest recently . especially , carbon based nanostructures , such as fullerene , graphene and nanotubes , are the most interesting structures because of their excellent physical and chemical properties .",
    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behavior with different diameter and chirality , and therefore they will be promising candidates for the new carbon - nanotube - based electronic devices , such as nanosensors,@xmath1 electric batteries,@xmath2 field - effect transistors,@xmath3 coulomb blockade devices,@xmath4 and field - emission displays.@xmath5    the quantum transport properties of cnt systems have been investigated experimentally by many authors.@xmath6 the coherent quantum wire behaviors of an individual single - walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt)@xmath7 between two contacts and the conductance quantization of multi - walled cnts@xmath8 have been observed , respectively",
    ". moreover , onac _",
    "et al._@xmath9 have used an on - chip to detect the high - frequency noise signals generated by quantum dot formed in a swcnt with photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "this result so far indicates no intrinsic frequency limitation due to the cnts themselves . using the long - wavelength approximation , mele _",
    "et al._@xmath10 have studied the coherent one - photon and two - photon electronic excitations for graphene sheets and swcnts .",
    "the optical dielectric function of a finite swcnt has also been studied early by gradient approximation@xmath11 and by first - principle calculations,@xmath12 respectively .",
    "furthermore , the conductances for microwave field irradiated multiwall cnt@xmath13 and swcnt@xmath14 connected to two leads have been investigated by photon - assisted transport model , in which the conductance oscillations evolve toward a well - defined step structure and its sensitive dependance on the field intensity have been expected.@xmath14 this study has been extended@xmath15 to optical selection rule for swcnt very recently .",
    "the question thus arises whether swcnts could be useful as terahertz ( thz ) detection , which is more important in the use of quantum control to nanostructures . to the best of our acknowledge ,",
    "this important case for a driven swcnt - based system has not been reported previously .    in this paper , we present a theoretical investigation of the electronic structure , transport and optical properties for a metallic zigzag chiral swcnt under a thz electromagnetic field ( emf ) irradiation since metallic cnts are known to be one of the ideal system exhibiting quantum mechanical nature of the electrical transport.@xmath13 the dependence of time - averaged electron density of states ( dos ) , conductance , dielectric function ( @xmath16 ) and electron energy loss spectrum ( eels ) on the irradiation field strength and frequency are demonstrated for the system , respectively .",
    "some different characteristics is obtained and the results are compared with those for the similar physical systems in the previous works.@xmath17    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the analytical expressions of the time - averaged dos , the conductance and the optical functions are calculated starting from the system hamiltonian by ngf approach in sec .",
    "ii . some numerical examples and discussions for the results are demonstrated in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv concludes the paper .",
    "the ngf approach has been employed in last decades to study transport problems involving variety of interactions beyond the linear response regime.@xmath18 meir _ et al._@xmath19 have derived a formula for the current through a region of interacting electrons using the nonequilibrium keldysh formulism .",
    "here we assume that the external high - frequency field only causes a rigid shift in the electron energy spectrum under the widely adopted adiabatic approximation .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian for an irradiated swcnt embedded between two normal conductor leads reads @xmath20 where the operator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with momentum @xmath23 in mode @xmath24 in either left ( l ) or right ( r ) lead , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at the state @xmath27 of the cnt with energy spectrum@xmath28 @xmath29=@xmath30^{1/2}$ ] , which is similar as that of graphene though the boundary conditions of swcnt are different from graphene , especially in the circle direction . where @xmath31 is the hopping integral of cnt in the tight - banding approximattion , @xmath320.71 is the half length of in - plane lattice constant with @xmath33=@xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are in - plane wavevectors of dirac electron .",
    "the coupling between the electrode leads and the cnt with strength @xmath37 is represented by the third term in hamiltonian ( 1 ) , and the last term describes the electron - photon interaction in the cnt , where @xmath38 is the interaction strength under dipole approximation and @xmath39 the incident field frequency .",
    "moreover , for simplicity , in the above hamiltonian we have neglected the spin and electron - electron interactions although much attention has been paid to the pseudospin - related effects in graphenes@xmath40 and swcnts.@xmath41    now we employ the usually defined retarded and correlated green s function ( gf)@xmath42 as @xmath43=@xmath44 and @xmath45=@xmath46 to the hamiltonian .",
    "when the unperturbed gf @xmath47 of the nanotube is obtained , one can obtain gfs of @xmath48 and @xmath49 from the dyson equation @xmath50=@xmath51^{-1}$ ] and the keldysh equation @xmath49=@xmath52 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the self - energies are @xmath53=@xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55=@xmath56 $ ] , where the linewidth function @xmath57=@xmath58 describes the influence of the leads and @xmath59 is the fermi distribution function . in the wide - bandwidth approximation,@xmath60 @xmath57",
    "is taken to be independent of the energy and energy levels .",
    "furthermore , the gf of a honeycomb lattice ( graphene ) can be written as @xmath61 for a @xmath62 chiral zigzag swcnt , the periodic boundary conditions@xmath63 requires that the transverse wave vector @xmath36 supplies @xmath64=@xmath65 with good quantum numbers for the subbands @xmath66=1@xmath672n , and the longitudinal wave vector @xmath35 is confined in the first brillouin zone @xmath68@xmath69@xmath35@xmath69@xmath70 . applying fourier transform to @xmath71 one obtains the unperturbed gf in the real space    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are respectively the length and width index in real space , once the integration over @xmath35 is done in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , one can obtain the analytical expression of @xmath48 from dyson equation .",
    "therefore , the real part of the zero - bias limit linear conductance@xmath75 can be derived as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath78th - order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the imaginary part of conductance , @xmath79 , can be calculated from @xmath80 by kramers - kronig transformation@xmath81 @xmath82 where * p * denotes the principal value of the integral . from the complex dielectric function @xmath83=1 + 4@xmath84 with @xmath85= @xmath80+@xmath79 , in principle one can obtain all other linear optical properties such as reflectivity , absorption spectrum and eels by @xmath86^{-1}$ ] at the long - wavelength limit,@xmath87 where @xmath88 represents the imaginary part of the quantity .",
    "the effective electron dos will be@xmath14 @xmath89 in the tight - banding approximation , the dos of a @xmath62 cnt in the absence of perturbing potential reads@xmath41 @xmath90\\nonumber\\\\ & -&[(\\epsilon+i0^+)^2 - 2\\cos(2\\pi j / n)-3]^2\\big\\}^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be pointed out that eq .",

    "photon absorption ( @xmath78@xmath910 ) or emission ( @xmath78@xmath690 ) can be viewed as creating an effective electron dos at sideband energies @xmath92=@xmath93 with a probability @xmath94 .",
    "one notes that the multi - photon processes will be suppressed more or less in the cases of @xmath95@xmath961 , and the enough strong em field ( @xmath95@xmath961 cases ) will split sharp singularities in the electron spectrum except for its affection on the electron distribution of the cnt.@xmath97 therefore , in this work we concentrate on the cases of the relatively high - frequency response under moderate irradiation field strength for the system .",
    "in the following , we present some numerical examples of the calculated normalized dos , linear conductance and optical properties for an external field irradiated ( 12,0 ) swcnt . the tight - banding approximation hopping integral @xmath31=2.75 ev",
