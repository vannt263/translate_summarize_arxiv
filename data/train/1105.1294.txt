    "the cat has been studied intensively as mentioned above , but there remain many things to be studied . for instance , in the above studies it has been supposed and taken as a matter of course that the momentum and hamiltonian in the cat have the same forms as those in the rat , and it has not been examined explicitly so far . in the rat , we first write the lagrangian @xmath15 in terms of a coordinate @xmath2 and its time derivative @xmath16 , and then define the momentum @xmath1 by the relation @xmath17 .",

    "we briefly review the complex coordinate formalism of ref .  .",
    "we begin with the delta function of a complex parameter .      in quantum mechanics",
    "the delta function is one of essential tools in a theory which has orthonormal bases with continuous parameters , and the parameters are usually real in the rat .",
    "on the other hand , parameters in the cat can be complex in general , so we need to define the delta function of complex parameters .",

    "we assume that @xmath45 is also complex but asymptotic value of @xmath45 is real . in this case",
    "we can take an arbitrary path running from @xmath35 to @xmath36 in the complex plane .",
    "we call such a path @xmath46 and define @xmath47 for complex @xmath2 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 in the first line of eq.([delta_c_epsilon(q ) ] ) we have introduced a finite small positive real number @xmath50 , and in the second equality we have assumed that @xmath51 goes larger than @xmath52 .",

    "we express the modified complex conjugate as @xmath72 .      for some state @xmath76 with some complex parameter @xmath77 , we define a modified bra @xmath78 by @xmath79 the modified bra is analytically extended bra with regard to the parameter @xmath77 .",

    "we can express the four relations simply as @xmath90 various examples of the usage of the modified complex conjugate , modified bra and modified hermitian conjugate are given in ref .  .      in this subsection following ref .",

    "since the annihilation operator of the coherent state is given by replacing @xmath25 and @xmath112 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 in eq.([annihilation ] ) , @xmath113 we obtain @xmath114    eqs.([coh_q])([coh_p ] ) inspire us to define @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath115 with the introduction of complex @xmath2 and @xmath1 as @xmath116 these expressions satisfy eqs.([qhatqket = qqket_new])([phatpket = ppket_new])([commutator_q_p_new ] ) , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are normalized so that they satisfy the following relations , @xmath117 where we have used the expression of eq.([delta_c_epsilon(q ) ] ) , and @xmath118 and @xmath119 are given by @xmath120 for sufficiently large @xmath121 the tamed delta function in eq.([m_qbranew_qketnew ] ) converges for complex @xmath2 and @xmath122 satisfying the condition like eq.([cond_of_q_for_delta ] ) , @xmath123 this condition is satisfied only when @xmath2 and @xmath122 are on the same path .",
    "similarly , for sufficiently small @xmath124 the tamed delta function in eq.([m_pbranew_pketnew ] ) converges for complex @xmath1 and @xmath125 satisfying the following condition , @xmath126 thus for sufficiently large @xmath121 and small @xmath127 eqs.([m_qbranew_qketnew])([m_pbranew_pketnew ] ) represent the orthogonality relations for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in the following we take @xmath121 sufficiently large and @xmath127 sufficiently small .",

    "it might help a tiny bit to accept @xmath11 and @xmath12 to have in mind that operators smooth in @xmath7 and @xmath8 like @xmath11 and @xmath12 have generically eigenvalues filling the whole complex plane , while hermitian operators like @xmath7 and @xmath8 have eigenvalues only along a certain curve say on the real axis in the complex plane .",
    "the consolation for our replacement is then that for our purpose of having general contours running through eigenvalues we replaced the special operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 by the more generic ones @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the philosophy should be that almost any small disturbance would anyway bring @xmath7 and @xmath8 into operators of the generic type with the whole complex plane as spectrum .",
    "the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are just concrete examples of such tiny deformation .",
    "so we stress that the hermitian operators as @xmath7 and @xmath8 are special by having their eigenvalue spectrum on a curve say on the real axis in the complex plane rather than distributed all over it .",
    "had we clung to the believe in curve - spectra , it would have been embarassing for our formalism that under heisenberg time development one could have feared that the curve spectra would be transformed into new curve - spectra which might not match at the free choice of contour from time to time in our scheme .",
    "now , however , as already stressed , if we use @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we have already from the beginning gone over to operators having any complex numbers as eigenvalues .",
    "so arbitrary deformation of the contour would a priori have no problem .",
    "thus we claim that the contours of integration can be chosen freely at each time @xmath37 , so that there is no need for any natural choice , which only has to run from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .    in this section",
    "we have briefly reviewed the complex coordinate formalism of ref .  .",
    "see ref.@xcite for the detail of the formalism . for our convenience",
    "we show the summary of the comparison of the rat and the cat in table [ tab1:comparison ] . in the next section",

    ".various quantities in the rat and the cat [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we study how the momentum and the hamiltonian are defined in the cat . before starting the explicit analysis",
    "we mention one of the general aspects of the cat .      as a simple case of the cat we consider a non - relativistic particle with position @xmath2 in one dimension with a potential energy @xmath140 , which can now be a complex function of the real variable @xmath2 at first .",
    "also the mass @xmath25 of this particle can be complex .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath141 and the functional integral takes the form @xmath142 \\pi_t \\left ( dq_t \\frac{m}{2\\pi",

    "we consider a theory such that the asymptotic values of dynamical variables such as @xmath2 or @xmath1 are on the real axis .",
    "the path @xmath46 denotes a set of arbitrary paths running from @xmath35 to @xmath36 in the complex plane at each time @xmath37 .",
    "since this regularized expression is analytical in all the @xmath34 for all different moments @xmath37 , we can arbitrarily deform the contour for each @xmath34 independent of each other , except for keeping some continuity in @xmath37 .    in the lagrangian , since @xmath146 is taken to be a small quantity in the denominator of @xmath16 , the kinetic term @xmath147 tends to dominate over the potential term @xmath140 .",
    "therefore a kind of restriction is needed for the kinetic term . in practice",
    "we impose on the mass the condition @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the imaginary part of @xmath25",
    ". then we can prevent the kinetic term in the integrand from blowing up for @xmath150 along real axis .",
    "we note that @xmath151 can be accommodated with this condition , since @xmath151 is obtained by taking an infinitesimally small limit of positive @xmath149 . therefore in the following we impose on @xmath25 the condition @xmath152 this is the wanted condition for @xmath149 in order that fpi of the cat is meaningful .",
    "we first consider the momentum . in classical mechanics of the rat",
    "the momentum is defined by the relation @xmath153 can we use eq.([def_p_delldelqdot ] ) as the definition of the momentum also in the cat ?",
    "it is not clear whether we can or not from a point of view of quantum mechanics because it includes @xmath144 , a quantity at time @xmath26 .",
    "the quantity @xmath144 is somehow unclear unless we define it properly including the fluctuation in the time - development from a quantity at time @xmath37 .",
    "hence we attempt to describe @xmath144 via fpi and derive the relation ( [ def_p_delldelqdot ] ) from fpi in the cat . in fpi the time - development of some wave function @xmath154 at time @xmath37 to time @xmath26",
    "is described by @xmath155 for the purpose to derive the relation ( [ def_p_delldelqdot ] ) we take the following approach .",
    "first we imagine that we have some wave function @xmath156 with some number @xmath0 which obeys @xmath157 for fixed @xmath0 eq.([phat_p_xi2 ] ) is a differential equation to be obeyed by @xmath156 .",
    "this is an eigenvalue problem of the momentum operator .",
    "if the set @xmath158 could be an approximately reasonable basis which has at least roughly completeness and orthogonality , @xmath159 we could expand the wave function @xmath154 into a linear combination of @xmath156 as @xmath160 where in the second equality for our convenience we have introduced the notation @xmath161 , which is the contributed part of @xmath154 from @xmath0-component . by solving eq.([phat_p_xi2 ] ) and using the expansion ( [ qbra_atket_exp_lc_xi ] ) we attempt to show that eq.([time_dev_qbraaket ] ) would give @xmath162 because this relation means that only the component with @xmath163 contributes a non - zero value to @xmath164 .",
    "the relation ( [ def_p_delldelqdot ] ) can be obtained by showing eq.([prompt_delta ] ) . in the following",
    "we take this strategy , and calculate @xmath164 explicitly . by expressing this quantity in terms of @xmath165 and looking at its time - development operator ,",
    "we can obtain the hamiltonian .      before going ahead",
    "we mention that the above approach can be presented in a more general prescription .",
    "not only the momentum but also other operators including the momentum can be dealt with as follows .",
    "we consider relations involving a wave function and a parameter @xmath0 going into the lagrangian at place of @xmath144 as eq.([phat_p_xi2 ] ) .",
    "we are thus motivated to think about a family of @xmath0-parameterized operators @xmath166 which operates on a wave function @xmath156 to give a vanishing value as @xmath167 if @xmath168 satisfies the following relation @xmath169 @xmath166 acting on @xmath156 effectively projects out the @xmath170 component .",
    "the strategy explained in the previous subsection is an example of this general prescription .",
    "indeed if we take @xmath171 , which is the difference between the two operators acting on both sides in eq.([phat_p_xi2 ] ) , eq.([phat_p_xi2 ] ) is reproduced from eq.([a_xi_ket ] ) .",
