    "we use shamir s formulation @xcite of lattice domain - wall fermions , which have exact chiral flavour symmetry for infinite 5th dimension ( @xmath0 ) , to study the chiral properties of quarks in high temperature qcd and their relation to topology .",
    "the chirally symmetric dirac operator should have a zero mode associated with each instanton , and obey the atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "in addition , these modes yield the disconnected contributions which distinguish the @xmath1 from the @xmath2 screening propagators and the @xmath3 from the @xmath4 propagators , and give related contributions to the connected propagators .",
    "since we use quenched configurations , we can not determine whether the anomalous @xmath5 axial symmetry is restored in the high temperature phase of the massless @xmath6 theory , but we can check relations required for the @xmath5 axial symmetry to remain broken .",
    "we measured eigenmodes of the domain - wall dirac operator as a function of @xmath0 on a set of quenched configurations in the high temperature phase .",
    "we check the atiyah - singer theorem for @xmath7 and calculate connected and disconnected scalar and pseudoscalar screening propagators .",
    "early results were presented at lattice98 @xcite .",
    "section 2 describes our analysis and tests of the index theorem .",
    "the meson screening propagators are discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 gives our discussions and conclusions .",
    "for our study of domain - wall quarks at high temperatures we use @xmath8 quenched configurations at @xmath9 ( 170 ) , @xmath10 ( 100 ) and @xmath11 ( 100 ) .",
    "( at @xmath12 , @xmath13 . ) on each configuration , we estimated the topological charge by the cooling method .",
    "we studied eigenvalue trajectories of the hermitian wilson dirac operator @xmath14 as the bare mass was varied .",
    "these vanish at would - be zero modes associated with instantons @xcite . based on these studies we chose the shamir domain - wall mass parameter @xmath15 for all 3 @xmath16 values .",
    "we calculated the lowest 2 eigenmodes of the hermitian domain - wall dirac operator @xmath17 for all @xmath9 configurations with non - trivial topology and for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 configurations , for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "( a third @xmath7 eigenmode was calculated for each @xmath11 configuration with topological charge @xmath22 . )    for @xmath9 , there is a clear separation between would - be zero modes whose eigenvalues decrease exponentially with @xmath0 and non - zero modes which rapidly approach a constant .",
    "by @xmath11 the situation is less clear . for @xmath9",
    ", @xmath7 appears adequate .",
    "we calculate the chiral condensates @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the case @xmath7 , using an eigenmode enhanced stochastic estimator . for each configuration ,",
    "exact chiral symmetry requires @xmath24 to obey the atiyah - singer index theorem : @xmath25 as figure  [ fig : as ] shows , the index theorem at @xmath9 is well approximated down to masses comparable to the eigenvalue of @xmath17 at @xmath26 of smallest magnitude .",
    "screening propagators , i.e. propagators for spatial separations , describe the excitations of hadronic matter and the quark - gluon plasma at finite temperature .",
    "we measure the connected and disconnected parts of these propagators for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons with zero momenta transverse to their separation ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the connected parts of these propagators are measured with a noisy point source on 1 @xmath28 slice for @xmath29 and on each @xmath28 slice for @xmath30 .",
    "the disconnected parts of these propagators are measured separating out the contributions of the eigenmodes ( projected on to the domain walls ) and approximating the remainder of the required traces with a stochastic estimator . for a discussion of stochastic estimators for staggered quarks",
    "see@xcite .    the @xmath9 disconnected propagators behave as expected . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the contribution is sizeable and increases as quark mass decreases ( it should diverge as @xmath32 if chiral symmetry were exact ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : disconnected ] .",
    "for @xmath29 the contribution is extremely small compared with the connected contribution ( on the scale of figure  [ fig : disconnected ] all points would lie on the horizontal axis ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the @xmath29 contribution vanishes in the chiral limit .",
    "for the connected propagators , we consider the combinations @xmath33 ( note : the connected part of the @xmath2 propagator is the @xmath1 propagator and the connected part of the @xmath34 propagator is the @xmath35 propagator ) . for @xmath29 , flavour chiral symmetry restoration and the absence of a disconnected contribution would make @xmath36 vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "the observed value is very small .",
    "the other combination , @xmath37 , is non - vanishing and has a finite chiral limit , as expected . in the @xmath31 sector",
    ", @xmath38 should equal the disconnected part of the @xmath34 and @xmath2 propagators in the chiral limit , for chiral flavour symmetry restoration with broken @xmath5 axial symmetry to be possible for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 is plotted in figure  [ fig : p+d ] .",
    "figures [ fig : p+d ] and [ fig : disconnected ] are consistent with this expectation .",
    "for quenched lattice qcd at @xmath12 , domain - wall quarks with @xmath39 are a good approximation to chiral quarks at @xmath9 and suggest an approach to chiral symmetry which is exponential in @xmath0 . the index theorem is well approximated and the @xmath1 , @xmath34 , @xmath2 and @xmath35 propagators show the correct behaviour for the restoration of chiral @xmath40 flavour symmetry for @xmath6 .",
    "the disconnected parts of the @xmath34 and @xmath41 propagators come entirely from the @xmath30 sector and have the behaviour needed to give a finite contribution when the @xmath6 determinant is included . isolating the lowest eigenmodes greatly improves our stochastic estimation of traces .",
    "our preliminary results for @xmath11 indicate a more complex behaviour .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this indicates that @xmath7 is too small , or that the condensation of instanton - antiinstanton pairs , as observed by heller et al . for @xmath42 using ginsparg - wilson fermions @xcite , is playing an important role .",
    "a dynamical simulation is needed to determine if , for @xmath6 , the @xmath5 axial symmetry remains broken above the transition .",
    "such simulations are being performed by the columbia group at @xmath42 @xcite , and preliminary indications are that it does remain broken .",
    "these pioneering results are limited by the strong couplings dictated by @xmath42 , and use of heavier quarks than would be desirable . to push closer to the chiral limit",
    "probably requires isolating the lowest eigenmode(s ) in the simulations .",
