    "quantum entanglement is one of the most challenging feature of quantum mechanics which has recently attracted much attention in view of its connection with the theory of quantum information and computation .",
    "it turns out that quantum entanglement provides a fundamental potential resource for communication and information processing , therefore , both characterization and quantification of the entanglement are important tasks in the theory of quantum information .    although entanglement is a global property of a state of bipartite system , originating from the superposition of different states , but the entanglement of a superposition of pure states can not be simply expressed as a function of the entanglement of the individual states in the superposition .",
    "recently , linden , popescu and smolin @xcite have raised the following problem : given a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 and a certain decomposition of it as a superposition of two others @xmath1 what is the relation between the entanglement of @xmath0 and those of the two states in the superposition ?",
    "they found an upper bound on the entanglement of @xmath0 in terms of the entanglement of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , using the von neumann entropy of the reduced state of either of the parties as a measure of entanglement @xcite .    in order to have motivation on this problem ,",
    "it is worth considering two simple examples of a two - qubit system @xcite .",
    "let us first consider a state of two - qubit system as @xmath4 .",
    "as we know , each term in the superposition is unentangled , yet the superposition is a maximally entangled state of the two - qubit system .",
    "on the other hand , consider @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", it is evident that each of the terms in the superposition is maximally entangled , yet the superposition itself is unentangled .",
    "it follows therefore that the entanglement of a superposition may be very different from the entanglement of the superposed states .",
    "several authors have generalized the results of @xcite to include different measures of entanglement @xcite , superpositions of more than two states @xcite , and superpositions of multipartite states @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use the notion of _ concurrence vector _ @xcite , as a measure of entanglement , and provide tight lower and upper bounds on the entanglement of superpositions of more than two pure states of a bipartite system .",
    "investigation of the entanglement of the superposition of two states , by using generalized concurrence as a measure of entanglement , are given recently in @xcite .",
    "we shall see that our definition of the generalized concurrence , based on the concurrence vector , is completely equivalent to the generalized concurrence introduced by rungta _",
    "@xcite , known as _ i - concurrence _ , so that we can directly compare our results with those of ref .",
    "we show that when the two superposed states are orthogonal , our lower bound is tighter than that given in @xcite , and also in the case that the two superposed states are not necessarily orthogonal , both lower and upper bounds are , in general , tighter than those given @xcite .",
    "an extension of the problem to include superpositions of more than two states is also presented . in the case that the states being superposed are biorthogonal",
    ", we obtain an exact solution for the concurrence of superpositions .",
    "in other situations , where the states in the superposition are one - sided orthogonal , orthogonal , and arbitrary , we present tight lower and upper bounds on the concurrence of superposition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section ii , we give a brief review on the concurrence vector , and show that this definition is equivalent to the so - called i - concurrence . in this section",
    "we also provide some definitions and useful lemmas , which will be used repeatedly in the subsequent sections .",
    "section iii is devoted to provide bounds on the concurrence of superpositions of two terms . in section iv",
    ", we extend our results and investigate the concurrence of superpositions of more than two states .",
    "the paper is concluded in section v , with a brief conclusion .",
    "we begin by introducing the generalized concurrence , based on the definition of the concurrence vector . the generalized concurrence for a bipartite pure state @xmath7",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the components of the concurrence vector @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 here @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are generators of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "for further use , we extend the above definition of the concurrence of a pure state to the concurrence of two pure states .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be two pure states of @xmath19 .",
    "we define @xmath20 as the concurrence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 by @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the components of the concurrence vector @xmath23 , defined by @xmath24 the second line indicates that this definition is symmetric in its arguments , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "notice that according to the above definition , we have @xmath26 .    before starting our study , it is worth making observation that the definition ( [ cpsi ] ) for the concurrence is equivalent to the definition of the i - concurrence given by rungta _",
    "_ @xcite . to do so , note that in eq . ( [ cpsi ] ) we need to calculate the expectation value of the term @xmath27 .",
    "motivated by this , we define the superoperator @xmath28 such that its action on an arbitrary operator @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 now , invoking the definition of @xmath31 , we find that eq .",
    "( [ superoperator0 ] ) can be written as @xmath32 this equation resembles the definition of the universal invertor superoperator , introduced in ref .",
