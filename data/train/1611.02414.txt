    "outflows and jets are ubiquitous in nature . they are observed both in local universe , mostly in black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) which are believed to harbour stellar mass bhs called microquasars [ 1 ] , as well as in powerful extragalactic radio sources [ 2 ] where well - collimated outflows or jets emerge continuously from the nuclear region of the host active galaxies ( agns ) or quasars harbouring supermassive bhs . the accreting hot plasma around bhs powered by extreme gravity of the central object results in the formation of outflow / jet which extracts mass , angular momentum and energy from the inner regions of the accretion flow . the outflows in microquasars are observed only in low - hard state of bhxrbs [ 3,4 ] which are radiatively inefficient .",
    "radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) are hot gas pressure dominated systems which are geometrically thick @xmath6 and optically thin , where @xmath7 is the scale - height of the accretion region .",
    "the dynamics of the flow is thus strongly sub - keplerian and advection dominated [ 5,6 ] .",
    "riafs occur when the mass accretion rate @xmath3 is very low ( presumably with @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 is the eddington accretion rate or the accretion rate corresponding to the eddington luminosity .",
    "outflows / jets are not likely observed in high - soft state of bhxrbs ( [ 4 ] and references therein ) , which are believed to be powered by geometrically thin and optically thick radiation pressure dominated keplerian accretion disk [ 7 ] .    theoretically speaking ,",
    "it has been argued [ 5,8,9,10 ] that a geometrically thick advective accretion flow has a strong tendency to drive bipolar outflows due to high thermal energy content of the hot gas .",
    "they may be additionally propitious to propel outflows / jets because its vertical thick structure enhances the large - scale poloidal component of the magnetic field , which plays a critical role in launching strong and collimated outflows [ 11 ] .",
    "apart from low - hard state of bhxrbs which power jets , at the other end of the spectrum , strong outflows and jets are observed in low excitation radio galaxies ( lergs ) harbouring supermassive bhs .",
    "lergs , a more generalization of low luminous agns ( llagns ) seem to be accreting gaseous plasma directly from the hot x - ray emitting phase of interstellar medium ( ism ) or from the hot x - ray halos surrounding the galaxy or from the hot phase of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) quasi - spherically in a radiatively inefficient mode with near bondi rate [ 12 ] .",
    "lergs thus resemble low - hard state of brxrbs having geometrically thick and optically thin gas pressure dominated strongly advective quasi - spherical accretion flow , accreting hot gas at a high sub - eddington accretion rate ( presumably with @xmath8 ) .",
    "this strongly advective radiatively inefficient accretion paradigm ( riaf ) or hot mode accretion having considerable geometrical thickness , is more prone to emanate outflows / jets and is very conducive to propel matter vertically outwards out of the accreting region .",
    "however , with the increase in @xmath3 as @xmath10 , the flow tends to be more centrifugally dominated and become moderately advective , with the central bh accreting relatively cold gas as compared to the hot mode accretion .",
    "incidentally the moderately advective accretion flow does not occur in a radiatively inefficient mode , but where considerable amount of both gas and radiation pressure seem to be present in the system , rendering the flow to have a moderate optical depth .",
    "geometrically , the inner advective region would then be relatively thinner than that correspond to riafs",
    ". the moderately advective accretion paradigm may also be susceptible to eject outflows .",
    "the difference between this paradigm and with the riaf , however , may lie in the acceleration mechanisms to eject bipolar outflows and jets , which we would eventually investigate in this study . nonetheless , with the increase in @xmath3",
    "as the flow tends to become more rotationally / centrifugally dominated with lesser geometrical thickness , the efficacy of the disk to eject outflows diminishes . beyond @xmath11 , the flow would eventually tend towards keplerian nature ( [ 13 ] ; paper ( in preparation ) ) .",
    "geometrically thin keplerian accretion disk plausibly fails to account for the launching and acceleration of outflows and jets ( [ 8,9,10 ] ; also see [ 14 ] for further discussion ) .",
    "extensive work has been pursued on the origin of outflow / jet , since the seminal work of blandford & payne [ 15 ] in studying accretion powered hydromagnetic outflows , which we like to focus upon in this study .",
    "physical understanding of the accretion powered hydromagnetic outflows have either been performed in stationary self-similar approximation [ 15,16,17 ] in quasi - analytical regime to demonstrate the importance of poloidal component of the magnetic field to launch outflowing matter from the keplerian accretion disk , or through magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations in both nonrelativistic as well as in relativistic regimes ( for details , see the introduction in [ 8,10 ] and references therein , also see [ 18 ] and references therein ) .",
    "in most of these studies the authors remain focused mainly on the launching of outflows / jets from the geometrically thin keplerian disk .",
    "the formation of the accretion powered outflow and jet is directly related to the efficacy of extraction of angular momentum and energy from the magnetized accretion flow .",
    "however , the exact mechanism by which the radial accretion is diverted into strong outflows and plausible jets still remains theoretically elusive .",
    "notwithstanding , jet launching is completely a magnetohydrodynamic process . accreting material diffuses across magnetic field lines threading the accretion region ,",
    "is then lifted upwards by mhd forces which then couples to the field and becomes accelerated magnetocentrifugally . however , if the accreting system is strongly gas pressure dominated , it may happen that the gas pressure gradient would play a more contributory role to lift the plasma vertically outwards along with the help of magnetic forces .",
    "in addition , turbulent reconnection of magnetic field lines may lead to flux annihilation [ 19 ] . magnetic energy dissipates through turbulent magnetic reconnection , may also power the outflow / jet emission ( [ 20 ] and references therein ) .",
    "most of the studies of accretion disk and outflow / jet have evolved separately , assuming these two to be apparently dissimilar objects . in the light of both deeper theoretical understanding and observational inferences [ 21,22,3 ]",
    "it is evident that the dynamics of outflow and the underlying accretion are strongly correlated ( for details see [ 8,9,10 ] and references therein ) .",
    "outflows and jets observed in agns and xrbs can only originate in an accretion powered system , where the accreting plasma around gravitating objects like bhs acts as a source , whereas outflow and then jet acts as one of the possible sinks [ 10 ] .",
    "the implicit coupling between accretion and outflow is then essentially governed by conservation laws ; conservation of matter , momentum and energy .",
    "the outflowing matter carries away mass , angular momentum and energy extracted from the accreting plasma [ 16 ] .",
    "we do not intend to investigate the physics of jet formation and its launching mechanism which is altogether a different field of research , but would like to focus entirely on the inter - correlating dynamics of the accretion and outflow within the coupled accretion - outflow region , and the conditions / criteria for jet launching .",
    "any proper understanding of the dynamics and the conditions of jet launching should necessarily require the robust understanding of the dynamics of the magnetized advective accretion region coupled to outflow , governed explicitly by the conservation laws .",
    "the relevant dynamical solutions at the accretion - outflow coupled surface ( the surface from where outflow decouples from radially inward accretion flow ) would then act as boundary conditions at the base of the jet .",
    "accretion disk - outflow / jet coupling has been studied on number of occasions from purely observational angle , in accretion powered systems [ 22,23 ] . from theoretical perspective",
    ", few self - similar studies have been attempted in the context to accretion - outflow coupling , both in non magnetized and in magnetized regime ( see [ 18 ] and references therein ; [ 8,9,10,24,25,26 ] ) .",
    "notwithstanding , theoretically , it is still difficult to construct reasonably satisfactory and definitive model of magnetized accretion - outflow / jet coupled region , owing to the complicated geometry and inconclusive understanding of the inflow - outflow coupled region . on the other hand , few simulations on disk - outflow / jet coupling",
    "have also been cultivated [ 27,28,29 ] . in these simulations",
    "how the matter gets deflected from the equatorial plane has been studied largely in the keplerian regime .",
    "casse and keppens [ 30 ] performed an advective , resistive mhd simulation of accretion - ejection structure with the inclusion of the energy equation , however neglecting the viscosity and radiative loss from the system .",
    "nonetheless , it is still difficult to simultaneously simulate the accretion and the outflow regions because the time scales of the accretion and outflow are in general very different .    in the present work ,",
    "we endeavour to develop a robust viscous , resistive and advective mhd accretion - induced outflow model in the 2.5 dimensional regime , in the mean field mhd approximation , in the context to accretion powered hydromagnetic outflows / jets , focusing entirely on the inter - correlating dynamics of the accretion and outflow within the coupled accretion - outflow region , without aspiring to explore the mechanism of launching and ejection of outflows and jets .",
    "a complete 2.5-dimensional viscous , resistive , advective global mhd numerical solution of such a system is left for further work , and which is beyond the scope at present ; we confine our treatment to quasi - analytical / quasi - numerical power law self - similarity ( e.g. , [ 5 ] ) in a quasi - stationary configuration , by upholding the conservation equations .",
    "all physical quantities are scaled as powers in @xmath12 and @xmath13 according to their dimensions , in the limit of higher order polynomial expansion .",
    "we will perform a critical analysis of accretion - outflow region and provide a complete quasi - analytical family of solutions .",
    "although the quasi - analytical self - similar solutions are approximate , they , however , can provide a strong physical intuitive picture of accretion dynamics coupled with the outflow , as well as physical criteria / conditions to eject outflows / jets . in the next section",
    ", we present the formulation of our model .",
    " describes the quasi - analytical / quasi - numerical procedure to solve the model equations of the accretion - induced outflow . in  , we evaluate the coefficients of our self - similar solutions and analyze them . in  , we investigate the nature and behaviour of the family of solutions for accretion - induced outflow within the bounded accretion coupled outflow region .",
    "finally , we end up in  with a summary and discussion .",
    "we formulate the accretion - outflow coupled model by considering a 2.5-dimensional viscous , resistive , advective accretion flow geometry in the mean field mhd regime as strong outflows / jets are more likely to eject from a geometrically thick , advective region of the accretion flow . the vertical flow is explicitly included in the system .",
    "we adopt the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath14 ) to describe a quasi - stationary , mean axisymmetric accretion flow . as we have incorporated outflow in our system , within the accretion - outflow coupled region in advective paradigm , all the dynamical flow variables ; namely , radial velocity ( @xmath15 ) , azimuthal velocity ( @xmath16 ) , specific angular momentum ( @xmath17 ) , vertical velocity or outflow velocity ( @xmath18 ) , isothermal sound speed ( @xmath19 ) , mass density ( @xmath20 ) , thermal pressure ( @xmath21 ) and magnetic field components ( @xmath22 ) vary in both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the dynamical equations are vertically integrated over an arbitrary scale height @xmath7 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath7 is not a hydrostatic disk - scale height but a photospheric surface within which accretion and outflow are coupled . above @xmath7 , the outflow decouples from the accretion flow ,",
    "gets further accelerated in the hot nonthermal magnetized corona and finally forms a relativistic jet .",
    "we focus on this accretion - outflow coupled region within which the flow is mostly bounded .",
    "we only include the @xmath25 component of turbulent stress , which is responsible for radial transport of angular momentum outwards ( angular momentum get transported due to the diffusion of turbulent eddies ) .",
    "vertical transport of angular momentum occurs mainly through large - scale magnetic stresses , where the outflowing matter magnetically extracts or removes angular momentum .",
    "the accreting mass is assumed to be much less as compared to that of the central object , and hence the flow is not self - gravitating . as the accretion flow is inherently turbulent ,",
    "we express all the dynamical variables in mean and fluctuating part .",
    "microscopic viscosity and resistivity are neglected compared to the large - scale diffusion of turbulent eddies .",
    "assuming that the fluctuation in the density is very less ; in the limit of boussinesq approximation , the generic ansatz follows as @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the mean flow which is either a time average or an ensemble average .",

    "statistical averaging of mhd equations generates large number of turbulent correlation terms . in the present study",

    "as one moves from strongly advective regime to moderately advective regime , there is a sharp fall in the value of the poloidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "this is owing to the fact that the geometrical thickness of the accretion region corresponding to moderately advective accretion flow is much less as compared to the case in strongly advective accretion paradigm , as shown in figures 2a , b .",

    "we choose the value of corresponding @xmath151 for different @xmath5 to be maximum as illustrated in  .",

    "it is found that initially @xmath219 increases rapidly in @xmath13 , however there is a sudden deceleration of @xmath219 as the flow approaches the coupled accretion - induced outflow surface .",

    "although the distinctive cause of the origin and launching of accretion powered hydromagnetic outflows is still inconclusive , however , it is certain that the dynamics of the outflowing matter should be intrinsically coupled to the accretion dynamics through the fundamental laws of conservation of ( matter , momentum and energy ) within the coupled accretion - induced outflow region , and should not be treated as dissimilar objects .",
    "conservation laws are the most valuable foundation in physics , and play a significant role in understanding astrophysical outflows and jets .",
    "this is because the physical dynamics of the coupled inflow and outflow are essentially governed by the laws of conservation .",
    "the nature of the dynamical solutions in the accretion - outflow coupled region should then reflect upon the physical conditions / criteria to eject outflows .",

    "the mean field approximation gives rise to the emergence of various turbulent correlation terms , where we restrict our study to first order turbulent correlation .",
    "note that turbulent magnetic diffusivity and turbulent viscous term in induction and energy conservation equation arises only from the kinetic part of the turbulent stress tensor through the reynolds stress .",
    "in this work , we have assumed isotropic turbulence and also neglected the contribution of other turbulent stress tensors apart from @xmath25 , which may be dynamically important .",
    "the contribution @xmath25 component would be dynamically more dominant as is responsible for the radial transport of angular momentum outwards .",
    "vertical transport of angular momentum occurs mainly through large - scale magnetic stresses .",
    "nonetheless , in future we would like to examine the possibility of their inclusion , as well as investigate the nature of the flow with anisotropic turbulence .",
    "the inflow and outflow are governed by eight coupled integro - partial differential mhd equations in the cylindrical geometry .",
    "limited observational inputs put constraint on the boundary conditions as well as the scaling relation between accretion and the outflow . owing to the fact that it is beyond the scope to have complete global numerical solutions of the said coupled partial differential mhd equations , motivated us to invoke necessary and proper quasi - analytical method to solve them . ever since the work of [ 5 ] , use of power law self - similarity in studying the accretion flow dynamics , especially the advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) to explain the nature of llagns has become widely popular .",
    "realistic strongly advective accretion flow preserves self - similarity reasonably well , within an appreciable region of the flow [ 5,38 ] , and has been widely used to explain observational features in llagns ( see [ 39 ] for a review ) .",
    "previously , self - similar methods had been indeed used to study outflow from the accretion disk on many occasions ( see the references in  in introduction ) . it is being found from many studies that self - similarity holds approximately well in context to outflows [ 40,18,28,29,41 ] .",
    "keeping the essence of power law self - similarity , we sought a generalized n@xmath77 degree polynomial expansion of all the dynamical variables in two dimensions , and solve the complete set of coupled integro - partial differential mhd conservation equations within the accretion - outflow coupled region self - consistently , in 2.5 dimensional viscous , resistive advective paradigm , where we have restricted up to order @xmath237 ^ 2 $ ] . in sections 4 and 5 , we have analyzed the nature and the behaviour of our mhd solutions in advective accretion paradigm with @xmath212 .",

    "we have mainly focused within the accretion - outflow coupled region where the flow is essentially bounded .",
    "we obtain solutions at a reduced vertical thickness irrespective of the nature of accretion paradigm which we have focused on .",
    "magnetic field tends to compress or squeeze the accretion region by counterbalancing the thermal pressure gradient .",
    "we found that the large - scale poloidal component of the magnetic field is enhanced with the increase in the geometrical thickness of the accretion flow , consistently . with the increase in @xmath3 as @xmath238 , with the accretion flow becoming less advective and more centrifugally dominated with lesser geometrical thickness i.e. , for the flow with moderate advection",
    ", there is a sharp fall in the value of poloidal component of the magnetic field , however with a strong enhancement in the value of the toroidal component of the magnetic field and consequently the differential magnetic torque ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this term ( differential magnetic torque ) is responsible for the magnetic extraction of the angular momentum to magnetocentrifugally accelerate the outflowing plasma out of the radial accretion flow , and this predominantly determines the outward flow of the matter in a moderately advective accretion paradigm which is more centrifugally dominated .",
    "however , with the decrease in @xmath3 as the flow becomes strongly advective ( @xmath193 ) and geometrically more thick with strong gas pressure and inefficient cooling , despite in the decrease in the value of @xmath2 , a consistent increase in the @xmath18 occurs , indicating that the gas pressure gradient might play a more contributory role to lift the plasma vertically outwards with the help of magnetic forces .",
    "the plasma in the accretion flow can be lifted outwards and ejected , only if some physical process can overcome the effect of the inward vertical force due to the central gravity .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of the solutions indicate that in the advective paradigm both magnetocentrifugal acceleration and thermal pressure gradient along with the magnetic forces , will help in lifting and accelerating the plasma vertically outwards , and the gas material will diffuse outwards across magnetic field lines . however , the effective contribution of either magnetocentrifugal acceleration or thermal pressure gradient to lift the plasma vertically outwards depends on the degree to which the flow is advective .",
    "in fact , with the increase in mass accretion rate as the flow tends to become less advective and more centrifugally dominated with lesser geometrical thickness , in general , the efficacy of the disk to eject outflows diminishes . in paper ( in preparation )",
    ", we have quantitatively demonstrated this aspect with the increase in @xmath3 from @xmath239 to @xmath240 ; the accretion flow with @xmath227 , least conducive to eject outflows .",
    "we obtain dynamical solutions in accretion - outflow coupled region only at high turbulent diffusive parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the accretion - induced outflow solutions have a profound dependence on turbulent diffusive parameter @xmath5 .",
    "it is being interestingly found from our solutions that the enhancement in @xmath5 renders the accretion - induced outflow region to attain a greater geometrical thickness .",
    "consequently , the poloidal component of magnetic field @xmath1 , as well as the differential magnetic torque ( @xmath2 ) get strongly augmented , enhancing the transport of vertical flux outwards . also the plasma beta @xmath4 increases steadily in the vertical direction , and its value gets strongly augmented with a small increase in @xmath5 , however , it always remains mostly below equipartition within the accretion - outflow coupled region .",
    "although we expect the accretion flow to have a large @xmath5 owing to advective nature of the flow , however , the values of @xmath5 that we have obtained in our solution may have been slightly overestimated .",
    "nonetheless , it is indeed being found from previous works [ 5,6,38,42 ] that strongly advective accretion flows , in general , are mostly plausible for large values of @xmath5 ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "gu and lu [ 43 ] also shown that the transition from an outer geometrically thin keplerian disk to an advection - dominated accretion flow is possible for @xmath242 .",
    "mckinney and narayan [ 29 ] , in their grmhd simulation of disk - outflow model , found to have large turbulent viscosity parameter in the accretion disk in the vicinity of the bh .",
    "further , king , pringle and livio [ 44 ] suggested a typical range of @xmath243 from observational evidence .",
    "one of the important approximation we have used in our study is to treat the scale - height of accretion - outflow coupled region as a parameter . in reality",
    "the physical conditions to launch outflow would consistently determine the vertical height of the inflow - outflow surface , from where the outflow decouples from the accretion region .",
    "moreover , in our study we have neglected the effect of spin of the bh in the accretion dynamics and its subsequent impact on the outflow , as the self - similar technique can only be used in the newtonian approximation .",
    "this restricts us of using this method to investigate the physical behaviour of the system in the extreme vicinity of the bh , where general relativistic effects are indispensable .",
    "although power law self - similarity is an analytical approximation , and the quantitative feature of the solutions may have been either overestimated or undervalued , the dynamical solutions show consistent and predictable behaviour , and do exhibit many physical insights on the nature of the accretion - induced outflow , as well reflect upon the relevant physical conditions to propel and eject plasma out of the accretion flow .",
    "power law self - similarity , thus , seems to be reasonably good approximation , within the accretion - outflow coupled region .",
    "nonetheless , more extensive study is required to understand the definitive criteria or condition in launching accretion powered outflows and jets .",
    "bh spin is a very important aspect that needs to be incorporated in the conservation equations atleast through the use of pseudo - newtonian potentials ( e.g. , [ 45 ] ) , while understanding accretion powered outflow dynamics or the correlated dynamics of accretion and outflow .",
    "it is found from the work of [ 10 ] that the spin of the bh significantly influences accretion powered outflows / jets ; for a rapidly rotating bh , the outflow power increases by @xmath244 two orders in magnitude .",
    "moreover , it is also essential that to have complete and a more realistic understanding of the dynamics of the accretion - outflow coupled region , a global numerical solution of such a system in advective paradigm should be performed .",
    "also , explicit inclusion of cooling / radiative processes is required for the completeness of energy conservation .",
    "the relevant dynamical solutions at the accretion - outflow coupled surface would then necessarily act as boundary conditions at the base of the jet .",
    "a more definitive understanding of the criteria to launch accretion powered outflows and jets , thus , requires a complete 2.5-dimensional viscous , resistive , advective global mhd numerical solution with the inclusion of bh spin , which is left for future work . in a subsequent work [ paper ( in preparation ) ]",
    "we will investigate in detail , the energetics of the magnetized accretion - induced outflows and study the spectral behaviour of accretion powered sources .",
