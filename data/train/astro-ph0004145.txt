    "more than 20 years ago it has been recognized that the modeling of the spectral energy distribution of ellipticals is affected by an ambiguity in age and metallicity ( faber 1972 ; oconnell 1976 ) , which has turned out to be a general complication in population synthesis ( renzini 1986 ) . however , considering simple stellar populations ( ssp ) in the two - parameter space of balmer and metallic lines , the age - metallicity degeneracy can be broken ( gonzlez 1993 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the major reason for the success of this strategy is that the balmer line strengths of ssps are predominantly age sensitive at metallicities above @xmath2 that are supposed to be the only relevant for elliptical galaxies .",
    "strong @xmath0  lines are thus taken as an indication for young ( intermediate - age ) populations , the observed scatter is interpreted as a considerable spread in age ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "an alternative path to obtain blue stars and hence strong balmer lines is to consider old _ metal - poor _ populations . in this paper",
    "we follow this approach and compute composite stellar populations that contain an old metal - poor subcomponent .",
    "the principal focus is to check if a combination of only old populations can reproduce strong @xmath0  without invalidating further constraints for ellipticals like metallic indices , colors and spectral energy distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ calsec ]",
    "we calibrate the ssp model indices and spectral energy distributions on globular cluster data .",
    "the composite models and their application to galaxy data are presented in section  [ resultssec ] . in sections  [ discusssec ] and  [ sumsec ]",
    "we discuss and summarize the results .",
    "we compute a new set of ssp models based on the population synthesis presented in maraston ( 1998 ) , in which the fuel consumption theorem ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) is adopted to evaluate the energetics of the post main sequence phases .",
    "the new ssp models cover the metallicities @xmath3}<0.5 $ ] and ages @xmath4  yr . the input stellar tracks are taken from bono et al .",

    "[ fehbssp ] ) .",
    "this observed feature is the key for the present analysis and is well reproduced by our ssps .",
    "the models from worthey ( 1994 ) , instead , predict a shallower trend , which implies that the very metal - poor globulars are younger than the more metal - rich ones .",
    "the synthetic fe5335 indices are in good agreement with the covino , galletti & pasinetti ( 1995 ) data , while for @xmath6}\\ga -1.5 $ ] burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and trager ( 1998 ) derive lower values .",
    "mgb indices seem slightly overestimated by the models at low metallicities .",
    "our synthetic metallic indices fe5335 , mgb and the balmer line @xmath0  for @xmath6}\\ga -1.5 $ ] agree well with the models from worthey ( 1994 ) , because both sets of models are based on the same fitting functions ( worthey et al .",
    "the uncertainty introduced by the use of different fitting functions is discussed in maraston , greggio & thomas ( 1999 ) and l.  greggio & c.  maraston ( in preparation ) .",
    "the low @xmath0  values given by worthey ( 1994 ) at very low metallicities are likely due to the assumption of too red horizontal branch morphologies in the models .",
    "as discussed in worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , iron indices are favorable as metallicity indicators , because the analysis with mg - indices is severely affected by @xmath8-enhancement  ( tripicco & bell 1995 ) : ssp models based on solar abundance ratios predict  for a given fe index  weaker mg indices than measured in elliptical galaxies ( worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; greggio 1997 ) . as at high metallicities the fitting functions of fe5270 are significantly more uncertain ( maraston et al .",
    "1999 ) , in the following analysis we focus on @xmath0  and fe5335 .",
    "we additionally consider the color @xmath9  as metallicity indicator which turns out to be in good agreement with fe5335 , while mgb systematically implies higher metallicities ( see section  [ resultssec ] ) .",
    "combining @xmath0  with fe5335 , for 47 tuc we obtain a ` spectroscopic age ' of 15  gyr ( fig .",
    "[ fehbssp ] ) in agreement with the age derived from the color - magnitude diagram ( @xmath10  gyr , richer et al.1996 ) .",
    "this example shows that the @xmath0-fe5335 plane is successful in breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy , when applied to simple systems like globular clusters .",
    "note that the high resolution balmer index h@xmath11 , instead , leads to a ` spectroscopic age ' in excess of @xmath12  gyr ( gibson et al .",

    "the evolutionary synthesis code of maraston ( 1998 ) is updated for the computation of the ssp spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the spectral library of lejeune , cuisinier & buser ( 1998 ) is adopted to describe the stellar spectra as functions of gravity , temperature and metallicity .",
    "the tightest constraint on the amount and the metallicity of metal - poor stars in elliptical galaxies comes from the flux in the mid - uv ( @xmath13   ) . in fig .",
    "[ sedcal ] we present the calibration of synthetic metal - poor seds on galactic globular cluster data in the wavelength range @xmath14    ( van albada , de boer & dickens 1981 ) .",
    "the model spectra are in excellent agreement with the data in the whole metallicity range .",
    "the increase of the flux shortward 3000    with decreasing metallicity is due to a hotter main sequence turn - off and a bluer horizontal branch .",
    "note , however , that there are globulars of intermediate metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath15 ) that show horizontal branches bluer than what it is expected with the canonical mass - loss on the red giant branch ( van albada et al .  1981 ) .",
    "this case is shown in the central panel of fig .",

    "m13 contains extreme blue horizontal branch stars ( ` blue tails ' ) , and exhibits an excess of flux shortward @xmath16    ( see section  [ m31sec ] ) .    as blue tails",
    "are preferentially found in denser and more concentrated globulars , it is likely that the particular dynamical conditions in such ` second parameter ' globular clusters lead to enhanced mass - loss and extremely hot horizontal branch stars ( fusi pecci et al.1993 ) , which may not apply to the average stellar field population in galaxies . since in early - type galaxies",
    "globular clusters contribute less than 0.6 per cent to the total @xmath17-light ( ashman & zepf 1998 ) , we adopt the canonical mass loss @xmath18 for [ fe / h]@xmath15 calibrated on ` normal ' globulars like ngc  5272 ( fusi pecci & renzini 1975 ) .",
    "in the following we compare old ( @xmath19  gyr ) composite stellar populations with data of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the models consist of two components : a major metal - rich population ( @xmath20 ) and a metal - poor subpopulation ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "more complex models with a continuum of metallicities will be subject of a future paper .      fig .",

    "the present set of composite models match the area that is covered by the majority of the galaxy data .",
    "note that the objects exhibiting @xmath28    are either classified as lenticular galaxies ( small open symbols ) or they are intermediate - mass _ field _ ellipticals ( ngc  1700 , ngc  3377 , ngc  5831 , ngc  6702 , ngc  7454 ) or dwarf ellipticals ( m32 ( ngc  221 ) , ngc  4489 ) from the gonzlez ( 1993 ) sample .",

    "[ fehb ] , instead , can be modeled with the old composite populations introduced above .",
    "it should be emphasized that the bulk of ellipticals scatter around @xmath29   , so that less than 10 per cent contribution from metal - poor stars is required in most cases .",
    "the observed range @xmath30  is then due to a spread in the metallicity and/or the weight of the metal - poor subcomponent .",
    "the analysis with simple stellar population models , instead , yields an _",
    "age_-spread of @xmath31  gyr .",
    "another striking feature of fig .",
    "[ fehb ] is that the positions of the galaxy data relative to each other are the same in the fe5335 and the @xmath9diagrams .",
    "moreover , the locations of the model grids relative to the data points in the two panels are in good agreement , so that both the metallic index fe5335 and the color @xmath9  consistently constrain the metallicity range for the major component to @xmath32 .",
    "this strongly reinforces the use of fe5335 as metallicity indicator ( see section  [ calsec ] ) . in fig .  [ mghb ]",
    "we show the same data and the same model grid in the @xmath0-mgb plane .",
    "as discussed in section 2.1 , mg lines of ellipticals are generally stronger than any ssp model .",
    "this feature is attributed to an enhancement of mg in luminous ellipticals . as a consequence",
    "the metallicities derived from the mg - indices are substantially higher and provoke severe inconsistencies with observed colors ( see also saglia et al .",
    "as the latter are much less affected by abundance ratio anomalies , the @xmath33-@xmath9plane represents the more reliable constraint on stellar population models .",
    "note that the @xmath0  line index additionally suffers from uncertainties in the correction for contamination by emission ( gonzlez 1993 ) , which can lead to an underestimation of the @xmath0  line strength .",
    "this effect may explain the low values @xmath34    that fall below the model grid in fig .",
    "[ fehb ] .",
    "the fluxes radiated by metal - poor stellar populations are high in the mid - uv ( @xmath13   ) , and decrease shortward 2000    ( fig .  [ sedcal ] ) .",
    "the so - called uv - upturn below 2000    observed in elliptical galaxies ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) , instead , is most likely due to late evolutionary phases of old metal - rich populations ( greggio & renzini 1990 ; dorman , oconnell & rood 1995 ; yi , demarque & oemler 1998 ; greggio & renzini 1999 ) . the amount of metal - poor stars in elliptical galaxies is therefore tightly constrained by the flux in the mid - uv around 2500   .",
    "a model based on the closed - box metallicity distribution is not compatible with the mid - uv flux of the elliptical galaxies ngc  4649 and ngc  1404 ( bressan , chiosi & fagotto 1994 ) and of the m31 bulge ( worthey , dorman & jones 1996 ) , which is referred to as the g - dwarf problem for ellipticals . on the other hand , lotz , ferguson & bohlin ( 2000 )",

    "as shown in table  [ modeltab ] we reproduce the observables of m31 ( for the colors see ngc  4472 ) with @xmath24 contributing 3 per cent to the total mass of the population , which corresponds to 6 per cent in @xmath17 , 9 per cent at @xmath0  and 61 per cent at @xmath61   .",
    "wu et al.(1980 ) , instead , claim that not more than 50 per cent contribution from a metal - poor component at @xmath61    is compatible with the mid - uv flux of m31 .",
    "the reason for this ostensible discrepancy is that the authors fix the metallicity of the metal - rich component to @xmath62 , which is lower than the value adopted here by more than a factor of 3 ( see table  [ modeltab ] ) .",
    "as the sed of a more metal - rich population has lower flux in the mid - uv , our composite model requires a larger contribution from the metal - poor component .",

    "( 1980 ) fails in reproducing the other observational constraints of m31 : it results in colors that are too blue ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , fe indices that are too low ( @xmath65 ) , and balmer line strengths that are too high ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the virgo elliptical ngc  4472 has virtually the same properties as m31 , wherefore it can be modeled with the same set of populations .",
    "the model given in the second line of table  [ modeltab ] is an alternative option for both objects assuming a higher contribution from the metal - poor subcomponent and a higher metallicity of the major population . as a consequence ,",

[ sedcal ] ) , which implies a lower @xmath17 over 2500    flux ratio .",
    "ngc  3379 exhibits equally high @xmath0 , but bluer colors and lower metallic indices .",

    "the principle idea of this paper is to enhance the balmer line strengths of old metal - rich stellar populations with a small fraction of metal - poor stars .",
    "the real metallicity distribution of the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies is difficult to assess observationally , as the stars can not be resolved .",
    "the _ hst _ color magnitude diagram of m32 ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) and the spectroscopy of k giants in the bulge ( rich 1988 ) show that these spheroids contain a tail of low metallicity stars .",
    "the closest giant elliptical for which color magnitude diagrams are available is ngc  5128 ( harris , harris & poole 1999 ) . analyzing deep _",
    "images in the outer halo of ngc  5128 , the authors find a differential metallicity distribution that is well reproduced by two closed - box - like chemical enrichment scenarios implying a large number of extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "in particular the differential shape of the distribution implies a formation picture in which a metal - poor and a metal - rich population are formed separately from each other .",
    "this picture gets further support from a number of studies that discover bimodal color and metallicity distributions of globular clusters in at least half of the early - type galaxy population ( zepf & ashman 1993 ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ) .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric investigations indicate that both populations are old ( cohen , blakeslee & ryzhov 1998 ; kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998 ; kissler - patig , forbes & minniti 1998 ; kundu et al .",
    "1999 ; puzia et al.1999 ) .",
    "more specifically , puzia et al .  ( 1999 ) find that the two populations in ngc  4472 are old and coeval , with metallicities @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in the framework of hierarchical structure formation galaxies",
    "are built by mergers of smaller objects ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) .",
    "a merger of coeval systems without newly induced star formation would result in a coeval composite population .",
    "the accretion of a dwarf galaxy by a larger system ( minor merger ) qualitatively explains the existence of a metal - poor subpopulation .",
    "there is an additional important effect that is independent of the assumed scheme of galaxy formation . as discussed by greggio ( 1997 ) ,",
    "a sizable fraction of metal - poor stars from the outer parts of a galaxy contaminate the light coming from the center due to projection and orbital mixing ( ciotti , stiavelli & braccesi 1995 ) .",
    "the authors find that projection effects lower the actual central metallicity by roughly 10 per cent .",
    "the metal - poor components in the composite models of m31 , ngc  4472 and ngc  3379 ( table  [ modeltab ] ) dilute the metallicities of the metal - rich populations by 3 , 6 , and 4 per cent , respectively .",
    "projection effects alone thus may be sufficient to explain the amount of metal - poor stars considered in the present analysis .",
    "there are observational indications from the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 , 1993 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ) and the color - magnitude relation ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) that limit the fraction of the young population to less than 10 per cent .",
    "as late star formation leads to low @xmath8/fe ratios ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ; thomas 1999 ) , the addition of a young population provokes inconsistencies with the high @xmath8/fe ratios observed in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , worthey et al .",
    "also the redshift evolution of colors ( aragn salamanca et al.1993 ) , of the mg-@xmath77 relation ( bender , ziegler & bruzual 1996 ) , of the kormendy relation ( ziegler et al.1999 ) , and of the color gradients in cluster ellipticals ( saglia et al .",
    "2000 ) leave little space for a significant contribution from a young subcomponent .",
    "the addition of an old , metal - poor population as discussed in this paper can reconcile these findings with strong balmer lines .",
    "disturbed field ellipticals that have strong @xmath0  absorption ( schweizer et al .  1990 ) and blue optical colors ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) do not show any signature of recent star formation activity in the infrared colors ( silva & bothun 1998a , 1998b ) . as discussed by these authors , recent mergers may not have been accompanied by significant star formation , but metallicity effects are favored to explain the enhanced @xmath0  line strengths .",
    "in this paper we show that strong balmer lines can be produced by composite populations that contain a small fraction of old _ metal - poor _ stars .",
    "the key to this result is that at low metallicities and old ages our ssp models show a steep increase of @xmath0  with decreasing metallicity , in accordance to what is observed in metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "we compute composite stellar population models that consist of an underlying old metal - rich population and a small fraction of an old metal - poor subcomponent . assuming a 10 per cent contribution from metal - poor stars , we construct a grid of models in the @xmath0-fe5335 and the @xmath0-@xmath9  planes that reproduce @xmath0  up to @xmath78    and covers most of the elliptical galaxy data .",
    "it should be emphasized that the same conclusion holds for all balmer lines , e.g.  h@xmath79 and h@xmath80 .",
    "more specifically , the data of all cluster and luminous field ellipticals can be explained by our models without invoking young ages .",
    "the scatter in balmer line strengths is then caused by a spread in the metallicity and/or the weight of the metal - poor component .",
    "most ellipticals can be modeled with less than 10 per cent of metal - poor stars as the data scatter about @xmath29   .",
    "we further show that the spectral energy distributions of the composite models that reproduce the indices and colors of representative examples agree well with the observed spectra in the wavelength range @xmath81   .",
    "our models are perfectly compatible with the observed minimum at 2500   , that tightly constrains the possible amount of metal - poor stars .",
    "we conclude that the age - metallicity degeneracy for complex systems like elliptical galaxies still remains to be solved .",
    "the perturbation with old _ metal - poor _ stars to obtain strong balmer lines is alternative to the addition of a _ young _ metal - rich population ( e.g. , de jong & davies 1997 ; kuntschner 2000 ; longhetti et al .",
    "the key to discriminate between the two options lies in the evolution of balmer lines with redshift .",
    "a young population of @xmath82  gyr should leave its fingerprints with a significant peak of balmer line strengths at redshifts @xmath83 , depending on the cosmology , which has not been detected so far ( ziegler & bender 1997 ) .",
    "the model presented here , instead , predicts balmer lines to become monotonically stronger with redshift .",
