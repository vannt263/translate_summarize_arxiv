    "recently , the study of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in disordered potentials , known as `` dirty boson problem '' @xcite , has paid a special attention .",
    "experimentally , it was first studied in the context of the motion of superfluid helium in porous vycor glass @xcite .",
    "the problem of boson localization , the superfluid - insulator transition , and the nature of elementary excitations in lattice models with random site potentials characterized by hubbard or equivalent models have been the object of several theoretical investigations @xcite and monte carlo numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "such random potentials suppress or may even completely destroy the long - range order related to bec @xcite leading to the transition to the so - called bose glass phase @xcite .",
    "this state is characterized by a finite compressibility , the absence of a gap in the single particle spectrum , and a nonvanishing density of states at zero energy .",
    "bose systems with disorder have also been addressed in the uniform system without lattices i.e. continuum regime using the bogoliubov model @xcite , hydrodynamic approximation@xcite , beliaev - popov diagrammatic technique @xcite , mean - field theory @xcite , and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the main finding of the above studies is that both bec and superfluidity are depressed due the competition between the two - body repulsive interaction and the random potential .",
    "the random potential can be created using different techniques for example , laser speckles which are produced by focusing the laser beam on a glass plate @xcite , wire traps represent magnetic traps on atomic chips @xcite .",
    "also , deep @xcite and incommensurable lattices provide a useful random medium@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there has been immense progress in creating becs with strong magnetic dipoles @xcite , and heteronuclear molecules with strong electric dipoles @xcite ( e.g. , rbcs ) as well as rydberg atoms in electric fields @xcite .",
    "what renders such systems particularly fascinating is that the atoms interact via a dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) that is both long - ranged and anisotropic which leads to the observation of novel phenomena in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "recently , uniform dipolar bose gas with a gaussian disorder correlation function @xcite and a lorentzian @xcite , have been investigated using mean field theory at zero temperature .",
    "most recently , a delta - correlated disorder is examined by the same group @xcite employing the bogoliubov theory at finite temperatures . the main result emerging from these explorations",
    "is that the anisotropy of the two - particle ddi is passed on to both bec and the superfluid fraction .    in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) homogeneous dipolar bose gas in a weak random potential with gaussian correlation by employing a perturbation theory at finite temperature .",
    "the gaussian - correlated disorder is defined by both the strength and the correlation length of the disorder ( see eq.([disp ] ) ) which permit us to well control the interplay between the disorder correlation length and the interaction strength .",
    "therefore , this makes our model completely different from that of ref.@xcite and thus , our results are also different in particular at zero temperature . among the advantages of the gaussian - correlated disorder potential",
    "is that its presence in 1d bose gas with short - range potential can undergo a finite - temperature phase transition between two distinct states : fluid and insulator @xcite . in 3d",
    "case , bec with a weak , gaussian - correlated disordered potential can constitute a good model to describe the bose glass phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , we investigate , for the first time , the behavior of the anomalous density of a dirty bec with ddi .",
    "this quantity which grows with interactions and vanishes in noninteracting systems@xcite , is important to fully understand the interplay of disorder and interactions .",
    "the anomalous density is often neglected in the literature without any physical or mathematical justifications .",
    "indeed , it is usually of order or even larger than the noncondensed density ( see eq.([heis ] ) ) regardless of the system in which it is studied namely bec with pure contact interaction @xcite , bec - impurity mixtures@xcite or dipolar bec @xcite .",
    "moreover , the absence of the anomalous averages renders the system unstable .",
    "we show , in addition , how the anisotropy of the ddi enhances quantum , thermal and disorder fluctuations as well as the superfluid fraction .",
    "we find that the thermal fluctuations contribution to the condensate depletion and the superfluid fraction coincide with those obtained in @xcite for a delta - correlated disorder .",
    "this is in fact natural since we assume that disorder , quantum and thermal fluctuations are too small that the hamiltonian of the system can be expanded in both leading order of disorder plus thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore , disorder and thermal fluctuations are additive and , thus , independent from each other .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we describe our model of the dipolar dilute bose gas in a general random potential . in section [ zerot ] , we derive analytical expressions for the condensate fluctuations , the second order correlation function and some thermodynamic quantities for external random potential with gaussian correlation at finite temperature and compare our finding with the mean field results of ref @xcite .",
    "we show that the competition between both contact interaction - disorder and ddi - disorder leads to enhance the condensate depletion , the anomalous density , disorder fluctuation and the ground state energy .",
    "we establish the validity criteria of the bogoliubov theory of disordered dipolar systems . in section [ superfluid ] ,",
    "the superfluid fraction is obtained and its characteristics are discussed . in section [ trap ] , we extend our results to the case of a harmonically trapped gas by making use of the local density approximation .",
    "finally , our conclusions remain in section[conc ] .",
    "we consider the effects of an external random field on a dilute 3d dipolar bose gas with dipoles oriented perpendicularly to the plane .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote , respectively the usual creation and annihilation field operators , the interaction potential @xmath3 , @xmath4 corresponds to the short - range part of the interaction and is parametrized by the scattering length as @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to mention here that the contact potential exhibits ultraviolet divergences in both 2d and 3d geometries .",
    "common ways to cure these inconsistencies is the use of either renormalization or a pseudopotential .",
    "+ on the other hand , the dipole - dipole component reads @xmath6 where the coupling constant @xmath7 is @xmath8 for particles having a permanent magnetic dipole moment @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the magnetic permeability in vacuum ) and @xmath11 for particles having a permanent electric dipole @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the permittivity of vacuum ) , @xmath14 is the particle mass , and @xmath15 is the angle between the relative position of the particles @xmath16 and the direction of the dipole .",
    "the characteristic dipole - dipole distance can be defined as @xmath17 .",
    "the disorder potential is described by vanishing ensemble averages @xmath18 and a finite correlation of the form @xmath19 .    passing to the fourier",
    "transform and working in the momentum space , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) takes the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a quantization volume , and the interaction potential in momentum space is given by @xcite @xmath22,\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the dimensionless relative strength which describes the interplay between the ddi and short - range interactions .",
    "+ assuming the weakly interacting regime where @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the healing length and @xmath26 is the total density , we may use the bogoliubov approach . applying the inhomogeneous bogoliubov transformations @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are operators of elementary excitations .",
    "the bogoliubov functions @xmath30 are expressed in a standard way : @xmath31 with @xmath32 is the energy of free particle , and @xmath33 the bogoliubov excitations energy is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the zeroth order chemical potential .",
    "+ importantly , the spectrum ( [ spec ] ) is independent of the random potential .",
    "this independence holds in fact only in zeroth order in perturbation theory ; conversely , higher order calculations render the spectrum dependent on the random potential due to the contribution of the anomalous terms ( see below ) . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the excitations are sound waves @xmath37 , where @xmath38 with @xmath39 is the sound velocity without ddi . due to the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction ,",
    "the sound velocity acquires a dependence on the propagation direction , which is fixed by the angle @xmath15 between the propagation direction and the dipolar orientation .",
    "this angular dependence of the sound velocity has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "therefore , the diagonal form of the hamiltonian of the dirty dipolar bose gas ( [ ham1 ] ) can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , + @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the total number of particles . @xmath44,\\ ] ] is the ground - state energy correction due to qunatum fluctuations .",
    "@xmath45 gives the correction to the ground - state energy due to the external random potential .",
    "the noncondensed and the anomalous densities are defined as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . then invoking for the operators @xmath48 the transformation ( [ trans ] ) , setting @xmath49 and putting the rest of the expectation values equal to zero , where @xmath50^{-1}$ ] are occupation numbers for the excitations .",
    "as we work in the thermodynamic limit , the sum over @xmath51 can be replaced by the integral @xmath52 and using the fact that @xmath53 , we obtain : @xmath54+n_r,\\ ] ] and @xmath55 the contribution of the random potential comes through the last terms in eqs ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) .",
    "these terms are defined as @xmath56 expressions ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) must satisfy the equality @xmath57 equation ( [ heis ] ) clearly shows that @xmath58 is larger than @xmath59 at low temperature irrespective of the presence of an external random potential or not .",
    "so the omission of the anomalous density in this situation is principally an unjustified approximation and wrong from the mathematical point of view @xcite .",
    "to proceed further in practical calculations , we must specify the type of random potential . for this purpose , we take the case of a spatially decaying disorder correlation @xmath60 . therefore , in what follows , we restrict ourselves to the case of a gaussian correlation with the fourier transform @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 with dimension ( energy ) @xmath63 @xmath64 ( length)@xmath65 and @xmath66 characterize the strength and the correlation length of the disorder , respectively . equation ( [ disp ] )",
    "makes the macroscopic wave function of bec not sensitive to disorder in and between pores , but instead depends on the disorder averaged over the coherence length .",
    "hence the ensemble - averaged system can become nearly uniform @xcite .    substituting ( [ disp ] ) in eq.([depdis ] ) , we obtain for the condensate fluctuation due to the disordered potential @xmath67 where @xmath68 is depicted in fig.[dis ] .",
    "+ the function @xmath69 - 2\\sqrt{2\\alpha/\\pi}$ ] with @xmath70/\\xi^2 $ ] , has the following asymptotics for small @xmath71 : @xmath72 .",
    "equation.([depdis1 ] ) is in good agreement with that obtained using the mean field theory @xcite .     from eq.([func ] ) , as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "black line : @xmath74 ( pure contact interaction ) , blue line : @xmath75 ( cr atoms ) , red line : @xmath76 ( er atoms ) , green line : @xmath77 and brown line : @xmath78 . ]",
    "we observe from fig.[dis ] that for a small disorder correlation length @xmath79 , the contribution of the ddi on the disorder fluctuation is not important whereas in the case of @xmath80 , the ddis tend to enhance the disorder fluctuation .",
    "+ on the other hand , for @xmath81 , we get from eq.([func ] ) that @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the disorder fluctuation ( [ depdis1 ] ) becomes identical to that obtained in 3d dipolar bec with delta - correlated disorder @xcite @xmath83 , where the contribution of the ddi is expressed by the functions @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "note that functions @xmath86 attain their maximal values for @xmath87 and become imaginary for @xmath88 @xcite . + for @xmath81 and @xmath74 , we read off from eq.([func ] ) that one obtains @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we should reproduce the huang and meng result @xcite for the disorder fluctuation in this limit .    upon calculating the integral in eq.([nor ] ) , we get for the noncondensate depletion @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a dimensionless disorder strength .",
    "the condensed fraction can be calculated employing @xmath92 .",
    "the integral in eq.([anom ] ) is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "this divergence is well - known to be unphysical , since it is caused by the usage of the contact interaction potential as we have mentioned in sec.[model ] . a general way of treating such integrals is as follows .",
    "first , one restricts to asymptotically weak coupling and introduces the beliaev - type second order coupling constant @xcite @xmath93 after the subtraction of the ultraviolet divergent part , the anomalous fraction turns out to be given as @xmath94 the leading terms in eqs.([dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) represent the qunatum fluctuation@xcite . the subleading terms which represent the thermal fluctuation@xcite , are calculated at temperatures @xmath95 , where the main contribution to integrals ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) comes from the region of small momenta ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the situation is quite different at higher temperatures i.e. @xmath97 , where the main contribution to integrals ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) comes from the single particle excitations .",
    "hence , the thermal contribution of @xmath59 becomes identical to the density of noncondensed atoms in an ideal bose gas @xcite , while the thermal contribution of @xmath58 tends to zero since the gas is completely thermalized in this range of temperature @xcite .",
    "the last terms in ( [ dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) describe the effect of disorder on the noncondensed and on the anomalous densities .",
    "equation ( [ anom1 ] ) clearly shows that at zero temperature , the anomalous density is three times larger than the noncondensed density for any range of the dipolar interaction as well as for any value of the strength and the correlation length of the disorder as it has been anticipated above .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 changes its sign with increasing temperature in agreement with uniform bose gas with a pure contact interaction @xcite . for @xmath74 , @xmath98 and",
    "thus , eqs.([dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) reproduce the short - range interaction results .",
    "furthermore , the ddi enhances the condensate depletion and the anomalous fraction for increasing @xmath99 .",
    "the condensate fluctuations manifest into the second - order correlation function as @xcite @xmath100 equation ( [ correl ] ) is obtained using wick s theorem . inserting then eqs.([depdis1 ] ) , ( [ dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) into ( [ correl ] ) , we obtain @xmath101 this equation is accurate to the first order in @xmath102 and @xmath103 and shows how the correlation function depends on the interaction parameter @xmath99 and the disorder length @xmath66 .    the energy shift due to",
    "the interaction and the quantum fluctuations ( [ fenergy ] ) are ultraviolet divergent .",
    "the difficulty is overcome if one takes into account the second - order correction to the coupling constant ( [ cc ] ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields@xcite @xmath104 however , the energy shift ( [ renergy ] ) due to the external random potential ( [ disp ] ) is not divergent and it can be evaluated as @xmath105 where @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is displayed in fig.[dis1 ] .",
    "+ the function @xmath108 -\\sqrt{1/2\\pi\\alpha}$ ] has the asymptotics behavior for small @xmath71 : @xmath109 . +",
    "as is seen from fig.[dis1 ] that for @xmath110 , the energy correction due to the disorder effect ( [ reng ] ) is negative which leads to lower the total energy of the system .",
    "note that this result still valid for any value of @xmath111 .",
    "another important remark is that the energy decreases with increasing @xmath99 .",
    "+ for a condensate with a pure contact interaction ( @xmath112 ) and in the absence of disordered potential ( @xmath113 ) , the obtained energy excellently agrees with the seminal lee - huang - yang quantum corrected ground state energy @xcite .",
    "+ for , @xmath114 , the energy shift due to the external random potential ( [ renergy ] ) becomes ultraviolet divergent .",
    "again , by introducing the renormalized coupling constant ( [ cc ] ) one gets : @xmath115 which well coincides with the result obtained with delta - correlated disorder of ref @xcite .    , from eq .",
    "( [ func1 ] ) as a function of @xmath73 for same values of @xmath99 as in fig.[dis ] . ]",

    "one can also calculate the shift of the sound velocity utilizing @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the bogoliubov approach assumes that fluctuations should be small .",
    "we thus conclude from eqs .",
    "( [ dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) that at @xmath120 , the validity of the bogoliubov theory requires inequalities @xmath121 and @xmath122 . for @xmath123 ,",

    "the functions @xmath140 , have the properties @xmath141 and become imaginary for @xmath88 ( see fig.[therm ] ) .",

    "it is evident that both thermal terms of @xmath148 coincide with the noncondensed density of an ideal bose gas .",
    "figure ( [ therm ] ) shows that the thermal contribution of @xmath149 is smaller than that of @xmath150 for @xmath151 , while the situation is inverted for @xmath152 .",
    "+ for @xmath81 and @xmath74 , both components of the superfluid fraction ( [ supflui1 ] ) and ( [ supflui2 ] ) reduce to @xmath153 , which well recove earlier results of refs @xcite for isotropic contact interaction .",
    "for @xmath81 , we have @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "consequently , the disorder correction to superfluid fraction ( [ depdis1 ] ) becomes identical to that obtained in 3d dipolar bec with delta - correlated disorder @xcite .",
    "we should stress also that for increasing @xmath99 , @xmath156 decreases , whereas @xmath157 increases for fixed @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , this reveals that there exists a critical value @xmath158 beyond which the system has the surprising property that the disorder - induced depletion of the parallel superfluid density is smaller than the condensate depletion even at @xmath159 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the localized particles can not contribute to superfluidity and , hence , form obstacles for the superfluid flow . for a large disorder correlation length",

    "the superfluid fraction can be either larger or smaller than the condensate fraction @xmath161 , depending on temperature , the strength of interactions , and on the strength of disorder .",
    "increasing @xmath162 leads to the simultaneous disappearance of the superfluid and condensate fractions .",

    "+ therefore , the bogoliubov approach should satisfy the condition:@xmath175 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether these results are still valid for @xmath176 in a range of densities where the difference between @xmath129 and @xmath161 can be significant and hence , the system yields a transition to a new quantum regime .",
    "the response to these questions requires either a non - perturbative scheme or numerical quantum monte carlo simulation , which are out of the scope of the present work .",
    "in this section , we discuss the case of a harmonically trapped dipolar bose gas with weak disorder .",
    "let us start by writing the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "these equations can be derived by factorizing the condensate wave function according to the madelung transformation @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the phase of the order parameter , it is a real quantity related to the superfluid velocity by @xmath179 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the properties of a dipolar bose gas in the presence of a weak random potential with a gaussian correlation at finite temperature . within the bogoliubov approach ,",
    "we have calculated the condensate fluctuation due to disorder , as well as the corresponding corrections to the noncondensed and the anomalous densities , second order correlation function , the ground state energy and the superfluid fraction in the homogeneous case .",

    "we have found that the presence of the ddi causes a weak anisotropy in the parallel component of the superfluid density while the perpendicular component becomes strongly anisotropic .",
    "we have also demonstrated that for a strong disorder strength the system introduces an unusual quantum regime where the superfluid fraction is smaller than the condensate fraction .",

    "<S> we investigate the properties of a three - dimensional homogeneous dipolar bose gas in a weak random potential with a gaussian correlation function at finite temperature . using the bogoliubov theory ( beyond the mean field ) </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the superfluid and the condensate fractions in terms of the interaction strength on the one hand and in terms of the width and the strength of the disorder on the other . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the disordered potential on the second order correlation function , the ground state energy and the chemical potential is also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for fixed strength and correlation length of the disorder potential , the dipole - dipole interaction leads to modify both the condensate and the superfluid fractions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for a strong disorder strength the condensed fraction becomes larger than the superfluid fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effect of the trapping potential on a disordered dipolar bose in the regime of large number of particles . </S>"
