    "objects should be detected in the @xmath42-band with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of at least ( s / n)@xmath58 .",
    "we also required that the object is detected in at least one other band .",
    "for all bands we use aperture - corrected magnitudes measured in an aperture with a radius of 10 ( labeled apermag3 in the catalogs ) .",

    "this selection makes sure that most real point sources are selected with a manageable fraction of galaxies ( see also section [ pscomp ] and * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   the aperture - corrected magnitudes in the @xmath42-band had to be independent of the size of aperture used to within 0.2mag .",

    "this criterion did not increase the number of candidate quasars , but did add more artifacts to our candidate lists .",
    "4 .   because @xmath28 quasars occupy a unique region in color space , we can isolate potential quasars in the catalogs by introducing color criteria .",
    "we applied two sets of color criteria to select @xmath28 quasar candidates , a conservative color selection and an extended color selection .",
    "the conservative color selection minimizes the number of foreground objects wrongly selected as candidate quasars and is based on the work of @xcite .",
    "the extended color criteria maximize the completeness of the high redshift quasar selection , without purposely selecting foreground objects .",
    "the conservative color criteria are as follows : + @xmath62 and @xmath63 and ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 and undetected in @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( when optical imaging is available ) .",

    "+ our color criteria are illustrated in figure [ cc_zyj ] .",
    "detector 16 has a time - varying quantum efficiency . as a result",
    "the flat fielding is not accurate and the detector produces a large number spurious detections .",
    "we therefore ignore objects that originated from detector 16 in one pawprint and were not independently confirmed in another pawprint .",
    "6 .   to check the magnitudes listed in the catalogs and especially nondetections in the @xmath41-band , we performed aperture photometry in each of the viking images at the location of the candidate .",
    "if the colors measured did not fulfill the color criteria listed above , the object was removed from our candidate list .",
    "the final step was visually inspecting all candidates in order to remove any remaining spurious objects .",
    "most of the eliminated objects were near the edge or just outside the @xmath41-band image , or on diffraction spikes .",
    "this step approximately halved the number of candidates on our lists .    with the conservative color criteria we selected 43 objects in the three different regions observed by viking : 7 objects in gama09 , 18 in the ngp , and 18 in the sgp .",
    "we applied our extended color selection to the ngp region and further selected another 42 objects .",
    "we loosely ranked the objects according to their @xmath76 color , i.e. , objects with a higher @xmath76 had a higher priority for follow - up observations .",
    "on 2011 june 2629 we observed quasar candidates from viking with the european southern observatory s faint object spectrograph and camera 2 ( efosc2 ; * ? ? ? * ) on the 3.58 m eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) .",

    "images taken with the @xmath78 filter were calibrated using stars within the efosc2 field of view . using the filter transmission curves , the ccd efficiency and stellar spectra from the bpgs spectroscopic atlas @xcite , we established a relation between the @xmath78 and the viking @xmath41 and @xmath42 magnitudes of @xmath79 . in fields with sdss coverage ( the ngp and gama09 regions ) ,",

    "individual images had an exposure time of either 600s or 900s , and the total exposure time per source varied from 600s to 8100s .",
    "we observed 45 objects in the @xmath77 filter , and 8 of those were also observed in the @xmath78 filter .",

    "the discovery of three black holes with masses @xmath216@xmath10  in the 2.9comoving gpc@xmath182 probed in this study implies a minimum density of @xmath12mpc@xmath13 .    to derive the space density of quasars in the volume probed by the viking data , we computed the efficiency of our selection criteria in order to correct for the incompletenesses in our quasar search .",
    "the volume density of quasars at @xmath11 that we derive agrees well with the extrapolated @xmath14 quasar luminosity function .",
