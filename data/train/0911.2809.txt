    "<S> we give a short elementary proof of tutte and nash - williams characterization of graphs with @xmath0 edge - disjoint spanning trees .    </S>",
    "<S> we deal with graphs that may have parallel edges and loops ; the vertex and edge sets of a graph @xmath1 are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath4 be a graph . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath5 is a partition of @xmath6 , we let @xmath7 be the graph on the set @xmath5 with an edge joining distinct vertices @xmath8 for every edge of @xmath4 with one end in @xmath9 and another in @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> tutte  @xcite and nash - williams  @xcite proved the following classical result :    [ t : main ] a graph @xmath4 contains @xmath0 pairwise edge - disjoint spanning trees if and only if for every partition @xmath5 of @xmath6 , the graph @xmath7 has at least @xmath11 edges .    </S>",
    "<S> an elegant proof of theorem  [ t : main ] is based on the matroid union theorem ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * corollary 51.1a ) ) . a relatively short elementary proof , due to w. mader ( personal communication from r. diestel ) , is given in  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 2.4.1 ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we give another elementary proof which is also short and perhaps somewhat more straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> the argument directly translates to an efficient algorithm to find either @xmath0 disjoint spanning trees , or a proof that none exist .    to give the reader an idea of the approach , </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly sketch the proof of the ` if ' part of theorem  [ t : main ] , restricting to the case @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the graph @xmath4 satisfies the density condition in the theorem . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath13 be a spanning tree of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we may assume that its complement @xmath14 is disconnected as a spanning subgraph of @xmath4 ( otherwise , we have two disjoint spanning trees ) . </S>",
    "<S> we seek a partition @xmath5 of @xmath6 with the property that both @xmath13 and its complement @xmath14 induce a connected subgraph on each of its classes . in order to find it , we start with the trivial partition @xmath15 and iteratively refine it ( in a suitable way ) until we reach the desired partition @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath16 denote the set of edges of @xmath4 joining different classes of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath17 $ ] is connected for each @xmath18 enables us to count the edges of @xmath13 in @xmath16 . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the assumption of the theorem gives us a lower bound on @xmath19 , and hence on the number of edges of @xmath14 in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the latter number is large enough to force a cycle in @xmath14 intersecting at least two classes of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here , we use the assumption that @xmath14 induces a connected subgraph on each class of @xmath5 . ) we can make use of this cycle by exchanging one of its edges for an edge of @xmath13 , obtaining a new spanning tree @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> when done correctly , the exchange ` improves ' the spanning tree @xmath13 in a well - defined way . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the initial spanning tree @xmath13 is chosen as optimal , then the basic assumption that @xmath14 is disconnected must fail , which gives us the desired disjoint spanning trees .    </S>",
    "<S> a variant of this approach has been used by kaiser and vrna  @xcite in connection with the conjecture of thomassen  @xcite that 4-connected line graphs are hamiltonian . in that context , the method is applied to hypergraphs instead of graphs , and yields a connectivity condition under which a hypergraph admits a ` spanning hypertree ' whose complement is , in a way , close to being connected . a significant difference from the above setup is that the situation in  @xcite is asymmetric ( unlike the packing of two spanning trees in a graph ) . it would be interesting to identify more general conditions allowing for the application of the method .    before we start with the detailed proof of theorem  [ t : main ] , we introduce some terminology . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-partition _ of a graph @xmath4 is an ordered @xmath0-tuple @xmath22 of spanning subgraphs of @xmath4 such that @xmath23 is a partition of @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> we define the sequence @xmath25 of partitions of @xmath6 _ associated with @xmath26 _ as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( see the illustration in figure  [ fig : seq ] . ) </S>",
    "<S> first , @xmath27 . for @xmath28 , </S>",
    "<S> if there is @xmath29 such that the induced subgraph @xmath30 $ ] is disconnected for some @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is defined as the least such @xmath33 and @xmath34 consists of the vertex sets of all components of @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath9 ranges over all the classes of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the process ends by setting @xmath37 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we also set @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ level _ @xmath41 of an edge @xmath42 ( with respect to @xmath26 ) is defined as the largest @xmath43 ( possibly @xmath44 ) such that both ends of @xmath45 are contained in one class of @xmath36 . to keep the notation simple , the symbols @xmath36 and @xmath41 ( as well as @xmath46 and @xmath32 ) will relate to a @xmath0-partition @xmath26 , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 will relate to a @xmath0-partition @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for instance , the level @xmath48 of an edge @xmath45 with respect to @xmath49 is defined using the partitions @xmath47 associated with @xmath49 .    1 2    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath50 are partitions of @xmath6 , we say that @xmath5 _ refines _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 ( and write @xmath52 ) if every class of @xmath5 is a subset of a class of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are distinct , we write @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> we define a strict order @xmath55 on @xmath0-partitions of @xmath4 . given two @xmath0-partitions @xmath26 and @xmath49 , we set @xmath56 if there is some ( finite ) @xmath57 such that both of the following conditions hold :    a.   for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , b.   either @xmath61 , or @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> the necessity of the condition is clear . to prove the sufficiency </S>",
    "<S> , we proceed by induction on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the claim is trivially true for @xmath64 , so assume @xmath65 and choose a @xmath0-partition @xmath66 of @xmath4 such that @xmath67 are trees and @xmath26 is maximal with respect to @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath68 is connected , then we are done . for the sake of a contradiction , suppose that @xmath68 has at least two components ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that there exists an edge of finite level ( with respect to @xmath26 ) which is contained in a cycle of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the graph @xmath72 $ ] is connected . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath73 is a tree and has exactly @xmath74 edges . by the assumption on @xmath4 , the graph @xmath75 has at least @xmath76 edges . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath75 has @xmath77 vertices and is disconnected , it must contain a cycle . </S>",
    "<S> but then @xmath68 contains a cycle as @xmath78 $ ] is connected for each @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> at least two edges of the cycle join different classes of @xmath5 , and therefore their level is finite as required .    3 4    let @xmath79 be an edge of minimum level that is contained in a cycle of @xmath68 , and set @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see figure  [ fig : change ] for an illustration with @xmath81 . ) </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath82 be the class of @xmath83 containing both ends of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath45 joins different components of @xmath84 $ ] , we have @xmath85 and the unique cycle @xmath86 in @xmath87 contains an edge with only one end in @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for an edge @xmath88 of @xmath86 of lowest possible level we have @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath90 be the class of @xmath91 containing both ends of @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> observe that @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> we will exchange @xmath45 for @xmath88 in the members of the @xmath0-partition to eventually obtain the desired contradiction .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath49 be the @xmath0-partition obtained from @xmath26 by replacing @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath68 with @xmath95 ; we set @xmath96 for @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> to relate the sequences of partitions associated with @xmath26 and @xmath49 , we prove the following two claims .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cl : connected ] let @xmath98 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 $ ] is connected </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath99 $ ] is connected unless one of the following holds :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath100 , @xmath9 contains both ends of @xmath88 and @xmath101 , or 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath102 , @xmath9 contains both ends of @xmath45 and @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> to prove the claim , suppose for contradiction that @xmath99 $ ] is disconnected . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath104 for otherwise @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> consider @xmath100 . since @xmath106 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 must contain both ends of @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath107 as @xmath108 $ ] would otherwise contain the path @xmath109 joining the ends of @xmath88 , which would make @xmath108 $ ] connected . a similar argument for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath110 completes the proof of claim  [ cl : connected ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cl : same ] for all @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by induction on @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath114 follows from @xmath115 and @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> let us thus assume that the assertion holds for some @xmath43 , @xmath117 , and prove it for @xmath118 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first prove that @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath120 be an arbitrary class of @xmath34 ; we assert that @xmath121 $ ] is connected . since @xmath122 $ ] </S>",
    "<S> is connected and since @xmath112 by the inductive hypothesis , we can use claim  [ cl : connected ] ( with @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) . </S>",
    "<S> condition ( a ) in the claim can not hold , because every class of @xmath34 which contains both ends of @xmath88 contains @xmath90 as a subset . for a similar reason , </S>",
    "<S> condition ( b ) fails to hold . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath125 $ ] is connected and hence @xmath120 is a subset of some class of @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath120 was arbitrary , it follows that @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> now by the choice of @xmath26 ( and the inductive assumption ) , we can not have @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that @xmath119 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we prove that @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath130 and @xmath131 . by the above , @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of @xmath133 implies that @xmath134 $ ] is connected . using claim  [ cl : connected ] as above </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath135 $ ] is also connected . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath136 , and by the maximality of @xmath26 once again , we must have @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of claim  [ cl : same ] is complete .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now easy to finish the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] . since @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the classes of @xmath140 are the vertex sets of components of @xmath141 $ ] , where @xmath142 . </S>",
