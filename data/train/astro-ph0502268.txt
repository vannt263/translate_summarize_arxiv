    "a number of anomalies , such as this high expansion velocity , a weak initial outburst , a very hot uv spectrum at early times , and subsequent rapid color evolution , indicated a compact progenitor envelope , typical of a bsg , rather than the expected red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitor .",
    "heavy mass loss could have driven sk @xmath8202 to the bsg stage ( mass loss being reasonable given the large number of wolf - rayet stars in the lmc ) , although evidence for a substantial envelope ( the long slow rise of the optical light source , the late appearance of near - ir h lines and a lack of early escape x and @xmath12-rays ) also exists . for a complete accounting ,",
    "see the review by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported narrow uv emission lines in _ international ultraviolet explorer _ spectra taken on day 80 , which they interpreted as arising from pre - existing cs material .",
    "an analysis of these spectra by @xcite revealed a large overabundance of nitrogen , suggesting both significant cno processing by the progenitor , and that a reasonable fraction of the progenitor s hydrogen envelope had to have been ejected to reveal such material .",
    "this argues that the star first evolved into a rsg before returning to the blue in a so - called `` blue loop '' @xcite .",
    "both rsg @xcite and bsg @xcite stars are known within the lmc , thus this evolutionary sequence is consistent with known populations .",

    "the er ( central ring ) surrounds the ejecta from the sn ( center ) , and is flanked by the north and south ors ( nor and sor , respectively ) . the companion stars 2 and 3 @xcite are positionally coincident along the line of sight .",
    "to increase the display range , the er has a separate color stretch . [ pcmap ] ]    since the sn lightcurve was strongly peaked for a finite duration , and the progenitor is surrounded by a structured cse , we expect that the light pulse will scatter off of surrounding reflective material ( e.g.,dust ) , producing `` light echoes '' that are observable long after the sn has faded @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite discovered a light echo at @xmath14 whose position agrees well with the predicted location of a contact discontinuity ( cd ) between the rsg outflows and the interstellar bubble formed by the early - type blue ms progenitor s winds @xcite .",

    "observation and modeling of this circumstellar environment provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the mass - loss history of the progenitor .",
    "the sn  1987a nebula is one example of a much larger class of bipolar outflows , which occur in nearly all evolved stars ( e.g.,luminous blue variables , b[e ] stars , agb mass loss , bipolar and asymmetric planetary nebulae ) .",
    "this `` stellar paleontology '' is of immense importance for understanding bipolar - outflow and bipolar - nebula formation mechanisms , not just of this object or in intermediate - to - high mass stars , but in stars of all masses .",
    "we summarize in this paper an observational effort , at the highest sensitivity and resolution to date , to understand more fully the entire circumstellar environment of sn  1987a , and to recreate a more complete history of the progenitor s mass - loss , as revealed by light echoes in 16 years of optical imaging . after introducing echoes in  [ sec - le ] , we summarize the data and reduction in  [ sec - echodata ] .",

    "we use the light - echo data to constrain the parameter space of these models , and we qualitatively sketch a hybrid formation sequence for the entire cse in  [ sec - evol ] . it is our hope that the results presented here will serve as a significantly - improved set of constraints for hydrodynamic models of the cse formation , for stellar - evolution models of the progenitor , and for addressing the general question of asymmetric and bipolar stellar outflows .",
    "when a light pulse is scattered by dust into the line of sight , an observable echo is produced , provided the pulse is sufficiently luminous and the dust sufficiently dense .",
    "an echo observed a given time after the pulse must lie on the locus of points equidistant in total light travel from the source and observer , that is , an ellipsoid with known foci .",
    "this simple geometry , shown in figure [ echo_toon ] , directly yields the line - of - sight depth @xmath17 ( and hence the three - dimensional , or 3-d , position ) of an echo , uncertain only by the assumed distance @xmath18 to the source . for @xmath19 ,",

    "[ dimages ] , these have been color coded red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "however we also found additional echoes between the hourglass and napoleon s hat , arbitrarily colored cyan for those looping to the north of the sn , or gold to the south . in later epochs , many of these southern echoes have positions that are more consistent with a counterpart to napoleon s hat , and have been marked purple .",
    "that diffuse structure exists between the inner hourglass and napoleon s hat has been previously reported by @xcite and ckh95 .",
    "these are consistent with the cyan and yellow echoes identified in the same region of the current data , which now map out a much more extensive volume of the innermost cse .",
    "contact - discontinuity echoes have been previously reported in observations only up to day 1028 , while we are able to trace this structure through day 3270 .",
    "napoleon s hat was imaged as early as day 850 and up to day 1650 by @xcite , while we detect its signal from day 659 to 2095 .",

    "[ 3de_parab],title=\"fig:\",width=312 ]    the region of space probed by a light echo is an unusual geometric function , and we are generally unfamiliar with viewing structures by their intersection with parabloids . to facilitate the understanding of this mapping ,",

    "these are intended to guide the reader in visualizing such intersections , and in translating from 2-d data on the sky ( left column ) to 3-d positions in real space ( right columns ) .",

    "echo positions in 3-d are computed from their epoch and 2-d image positions using equation ( [ sec - le - sb1 ] ) , assuming the echo center is produced by the light pulse maximum at day 87 .",

    "the top , middle , and bottom rows show the contact discontinuity ( cd ) , napoleon s hat ( nh ) , and the inner circumstellar ( cs ) material , respectively .",
    "colors correspond to those indicated in figure [ dimages ] , except for the yellow points in the cd , which were identified in wfpc2 images very close to a bright star cluster northwest of the sn ( p.a.300 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "we distinguish these data because large residuals from the closely - spaced , bright stars made it impossible to verify the echoes in ground - based images .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the 3-d structure of the light echo data is presented in paper ii , ",
    "[ i - sec - cd][i - sec - cs ] , however we describe the results in the following subsections .",
    "we begin with the reasonable assumption that the echoes lie on continuous surfaces , only subsets of which have been illuminated .",
    "echo brightness decreases with increasing scattering angle and distance from the illuminating source , and increases with dust number and column density .",
    "that echoes were not observed in some regions between the parabolae in figure [ 3dle ] need not imply lack of scattering dust , but may result from unfavorable geometry , or limitations in the data quality .",
    "when examined in spherical - polar coordinates , the cd echoes ( fig.[3dle]_a  c _ ) appear to trace two different geometric shapes .",
    "points east and west of the sn form a shell - like feature at roughly constant radius , while points south of the sn ( p.a.150210 ) form a radial feature at roughly constant inclination . in both cases ,",
    "the points appear to lie on a surface with some degree of symmetry , such as a spheroidal or conical structure .",
    "since only a partial cross section of the cd nebula has been illuminated , finding its inclination through numeric minimization of a merit function ( e.g.  the best - fit cone or line ; see appendix b of paper ii ) was not highly successful .",
    "we supplemented those results by testing how the echo points compared to geometric figures observed at different orientations , and conclude that the cd echoes lie roughly on a surface of rotation about a single axis inclined 40south and 8east of the line of sight .",
    "this axis may also be offset east of the sn by @xmath28 ly .",
    "the cross section gives some indication of an ellipticity of @xmath29 , with the major axis aligned toward north , however this is not a robust measurement .",
    "the data are transformed into a `` primed '' cylindrical coordinate system about this axis , designated by @xmath30 along the axis and @xmath31 the radius .",
    "figure [ plcd4 ] shows the resulting radial profile @xmath32 . assuming these data trace a structure that ( 1 ) has rotational symmetry about @xmath30 , and ( 2 ) is symmetric about the equator ( @xmath33 ) , an average radial profile of @xmath34 versus @xmath30 can be constructed by binning the points along the axis .",
    "this ( and standard deviations in each bin ) is shown over the individual data .",
    "some circles located at @xmath35 and @xmath17=48 ly appear disconnected from the rest of the shell - like material .",
    "these points , which we call the `` spurs , '' were treated separately when making the average radial profile .",
    "the probable cd structure is visualized by revolving this function about the symmetry axis , reflecting it about the equator , and reinclining it to the favored orientation , as shown in figure [ 3dpl]_a  b_. colors are the same as figure [ 3dle ] , only the southern echoes have been colored red and green to distinguish points marked with `` @xmath36 '' and `` + '' in fig .",
    "[ plcd4 ] .",
    "figure [ 3dpl]_c  d _ shows the complete structure in monotone grey , overlaid with the actual echo points from figure [ 3dle ] , to show exactly which parts of the complete structure were sampled .",
    "the complete structure is fairly complicated , and can not be described by a single geometric function .",
    "figure [ toons]_a _ shows a scaled cartoon of the salient features .",
    "a `` shell '' lies along a prolate spheroid with a polar axis of 20 ly and equatorial axes of 11 ly .",
    "however , the ends of this spheroid have been drawn out into tapering , `` radial '' cones with opening angles of about 35 , extending from 16 to 28 ly from the sn .",
    "embedded within this prolate structure are narrower , tapering cones ( the `` jet '' ) extending from 1026 ly from the sn , with an opening angle of about 20 , and a maximum radius of 3 ly .",
    "the `` spurs '' lie along a cylindrical annulus that smoothly encircles the cd .",
    "it is unclear whether the prolate shell is continuous in @xmath30 along its equator ( dashed equatorial lines in fig .",
    "[ toons]_a _ ) , since no echoes were observed from that region .",
    "whether this is due to shadowing from material closer to the sn is addressed in ",
    "[ i - sec - density - density - shadowing ] of paper ii .",
    "the northwestern - wfpc2 echoes are positioned at @xmath37 ly along the axis , and at roughly 8 ly in radius .",
    "this could suggest the prolate shell is pinched at its waist to a smaller radius of 8 ly .",
    "however given the very limited spatial sampling of these inner echoes , there is little evidence that they lie on a uniform structure .",
    "similarly , very little signal was detected from the spurs which may suggest that they are isolated clumps , rather than a uniform feature .",
    "figures [ 3dle]_d__f _ show the 3-d positions of the nh echoes .",
    "the northern ( green ) points forming the familiar bow - shape for which this structure was named @xcite appear to lie on a thin , cylindrical shell that is completed by the newly - discovered southern points .",
    "to avoid confusion between this and previous work , we will keep the name `` napoleon s hat , '' by which we refer to the entire ensemble of echoes . despite the temptation to call the southern points `` napoleon s collar",
    ", '' we will simply refer to these as nh - north and nh - south , when needed .",
    "two nearly - horizontal features protrude from this shell toward the observer , appearing horn - like when viewed from above ( panel _ f _ ) . in the following discussion",
    ", we refer to these as the `` horns , '' to distinguish them from the rest of the nh material .",
    "these are the echoes seen in early imaging that bridged between nh - north and the larger - radii cd echoes ( fig .",
    "[ dimages ] ) .    viewed in spherical - polar coordinates ,",
    "the nh echoes are consistent with a cylinder or hourglass .",
    "we measured the shape and inclination of such structures by fitting a biconical frustum to all points , as explained in appendix b.4 of paper ii .",
    "the best fit is an hourglass with elliptical cross section , oriented 40south and 7east of the line of sight .",
    "the semi - major and minor axes are 4.6 and 3.8 ly , with opening angles at the axes of 28 and 40 , respectively , and the major axis is rotated @xmath38 east of north . that the cross - section is elliptical is unexpected , and we reverified this by directly examining the data looking down the axis of inclination .",
    "the best - fit ellipse ( appendix b.2 of paper ii ) to the resulting distribution has negligible offset from the origin , and @xmath39 with the major axis rotated @xmath40 east of north .    removing this ellipticity from the radial values of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath30 yields the distribution shown in figure [ plnh4 ] .",
    "also shown is the average radial profile of the nh echoes , generated by binning the points along the inclination axis and computing the average radius about that value . as with the cd , we visualize the probable structure containing these echoes by reflecting this average radial profile about the equator and revolving it around the axis .",
    "the result is an inclined hourglass , as rendered in figure [ 3dpl]_e ",
    "h_.    an examination of figure [ 3dpl]_h _ shows that very little of the hourglass was actually probed by the horns .",
    "we show in  [ i - sec - nh - geom - horns ] of paper iithat such limited illumination was a natural result of the scattering geometry of this complete structure .",
    "the hourglass therefore flares to a radius ( or semi - minor axis if the cross section remains elliptical ) of @xmath41 ly about 7 ly from the sn along the axis of symmetry .",
    "the complete cross section is shown in the cartoon sketch in figure [ toons]_b_. of note are the radial features in , and about 1.5 ly above / below , the equatorial plane .",
    "ckh95 reported a small set of echoes within 3 ly of the sn that are coincident with the er plane , which they interpreted as evidence for an extended circumstellar equatorial disk .",
    "these nh equatorial echoes appear to extend this disk to a radius of 5 ly , with a thickness of @xmath42 ly .",
    "we note that this structure is inconsistent with nh being a parabolic bow - shock north of the sn , as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "although the red echo points in figure [ 3dle]_g  i _ appear to lie along such a surface , we can not immediately explore this feature in our data since it is unclear which extended - flux echoes ( cyan and gold points ) are associated with an hourglass .",

    "hourglass to the ckh95 data , we find the structure is inclined 45south and 8east of the line of sight .",
    "this compares favorably to the orientation they reported using a minimization - of - scatter estimator . adopting this as a preliminary orientation , we transformed our cs echo points into cylindrical coordinates about this axis , which revealed an additional subset consistent with those initially identified as part of the hourglass .",

    "only a small arc along the southernmost limb of of the southern lobe was probed by the earliest observed echoes .    a combination of fitting biconical hourglasses to these data , and ensuring that the inner waist of this hourglass reproduces the observed shape of the er , yields the 3-d geometry of both structures .",

    "a large subset of the extended - flux echoes ( circles ) are concentrated within 1 ly of the equatorial plane @xmath49 , between 1.54 ly from the sn , and appear to form a thick equatorial waist or belt circumscribing the hourglass . as in the previous two sections , we measure the average radial profile of these points in bins along @xmath50 .",
    "there is much structure to these data , which required the fitting of six profiles .",
    "we again visualize the nebula by reflecting each profile about the equator , and revolving it around the cylindrical axis , as rendered in figure [ 3dpl]_i  p _ , and sketched in cross section in figure [ toons]_c_. we identify five features in this data , discussed below .    the innermost radial structure is the hourglass , colored red in figure [ 3dpl]_i  p_. this is fairly cylindrical ( opening angle @xmath1612 ) , with a semi - minor axis of 1.2 ly , tapering close to the equator and opening just slightly at large @xmath30 .",
    "a very small number of points suggest that it also tapers around @xmath51 ly and flares at @xmath52 and 1.4 ly , but these features are marginal .",
    "consistent with ckh95 , we do not see evidence for a `` capping surface '' to this structure , as would be expected from a peanut - like nebula . to distinguish this hourglass from the larger one containing the nh echoes , we refer to each by their association , i.e.,the former",

    "as predicted above , we do find an extended equatorial overdensity in figure [ all_toon2 ] .",
    "however , compared to this newly - revealed cse , the models all have significant shortcomings .",
    "foremost , nearly all the predicted cs nebulae are quite flattened and oblate ( mushroom shaped ) , inconsistent with the prolate , hourglass shape we have mapped out . to generate roughly the right shape ,",
    "the equatorial expansion velocities become far too large , while matching these velocities can lead to rsg mass - loss rates that are too high .",
    "although these models can explain the formation of the er , they fail to explain the existence of the ors .",
    "this may be linked to the fact that almost all model hourglass nebulae have solid capping surfaces , which we do not observe .",
    "finally , the adoption of a pre - existing rsg asymmetry is entirely _ ad hoc _ , and these models make no attempt to explain _ how _ such an asymmetry formed , nor to model what geometry its interface with the ms bubble should be .",
    "@xcite have attempted to address one shortcoming in previous work by assuming that the rsg wind forms a wcd from which the density asymmetry is derived .",
    "in contrast to the above work , they also allow for a velocity asymmetry in the rsg wind , as defined by the disk .",
    "a wcd is characterized by the rotation parameter @xmath120 , the ratio of the stellar rotation rate to the break - up speed . for rotations less than a threshold value @xmath121 , the star forms a wind - compressed _ zone _ with an equator - to - pole density contrast of 310 , while for @xmath122 a wcd forms with density contrasts @xmath123 . by varying the wcd parameters , @xcite varied the rsg - wind environment surrounding the star , establishing the initial conditions for a bsg wind .",
    "this they addressed using self - similar solutions of wind - blown bubbles from @xcite .    for their fiducial model ( a rsg with 20@xmath5 , which is too high from stellar - evolution arguments ) , they find @xmath124 , which produces a density contrast of 25 .",

    "again , the peanut shape does not fit the observed cs hourglass , however they address this by noting that in simulations @xcite , the bsg wind can be shock - focused into the polar direction , resulting in a substantially - more prolate structure than that predicted from a self - similar solution .",
    "a few results stand out from this work .",
    "( 1 ) the wcd is a straightforward explanation for the observed equatorial density enhancement .",
    "( 2 ) the authors do not find the need to invoke unusually low bsg wind momentum or rsg velocity , although the rsg mass - loss rate is much higher than we deduce in  [ sec - evol - rsg ] .",
    "( 3 ) a single rsg star can not rotate at @xmath130 without the influence of a binary companion .",
    "@xcite estimate that a lower limit of 0.6@xmath5for the companion is sufficient to produce the necessary rotation speeds for this model .",
    "if rotation is to be invoked as a formation mechanism , then the progenitor had to have been a binary system .",
    "binarity has been invoked by @xcite and @xcite among others to explain the observed characteristics of the sn .",
    "a companion could have been engulfed by sk @xmath8202 during a common - envelope phase ; however , for lower mass primaries , the secondary can cause dynamical instabilities that eject the primary envelope @xcite , a process that is not suggested from the sn evolution .",
    "@xcite invokes the influence of a binary companion to produce the observed three - ring nebula , but his results are inconsistent with the ensemble of data presented here .",
    "@xcite suggest that the collision of winds between the primary and secondary spread out the wind into a truncated double cone . this is a novel formation mechanism for the hourglass feature we observe",
    "; however , their geometric model further predicts that napoleon s hat lies on the northern - half of the cone , which we now know to be false .",
    "@xcite suggest a variant on the double - cone scenario , in which the bsg wind sweeps up the base of the cones , leaving the end surfaces as the ors .",
    "furthermore , dynamical friction causes the secondary to coalesce into the primary , ejecting the envelope , thereby forming the er . again , this model is attractive as it suggests that a single mechanism formed all three rings .",
    "a testable prediction is that extensive rsg double - cone material should exist at and beyond the ring positions , however we see no evidence for such material in light echoes .",
    "if binarity is to explain the formation of the three rings , these models must be revisited to be consistent with the new picture of the complete cse .",
    "all the above models have neglected the effects of ionization on the evolution of isws .",
    "the progenitor ms star is expected to emit an ionizing flux of @xmath131 s@xmath7 , while the b3 i bsg star should emit @xmath132 s@xmath7 @xcite , both of which are sufficient to drive an ionization front ahead of the outer shock .",
    "@xcite have addressed the role of ionization in the to explain the reappearance of radio emission three years after outburst @xcite .",
    "their model of a pre - sn region suggests that the bsg had a mass loss of only @xmath133 @xmath5  yr@xmath7with @xmath134 @xmath115 .",
    "furthermore , the ionization front that formed this region would move rapidly through the lower - density polar regions of the hourglass , and could have broken out of the lobes , thereby eliminating any capping - surface to the cs hourglass .",
    "this is a particularly interesting scenario for explaining the observed geometry of the cs hourglass , as well as the evolution of the sn remnant across the spectrum .",
    "@xcite has proposed that an ionization front in the bsg phase induces hydrodynamic motions in the pre - existing asymmetric rsg wind .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the birth of a supernova remnant ( snr ) , both spatially resolved and in real - time .",
    "this event thus serves as a vital test to models of sn evolution , radiative shock processes , and snr formation .    as noted in the introduction",
    ", the ejecta - cse interaction will directly illuminate the structures it impacts , and the high - energy emission from the resulting hot gas will illuminate many other regions of the cse via photoionization .",
    "the results from this work will be tested by this interaction , and be critical in interpreting the panchromatic spectacle that will ensue .",
    "already , the `` hot spots '' detailing the impact of the ejecta with the inner edge of the er @xcite confirm the observed spatial offset between the sn and inner nebulae .",
    "@xcite show that roughly @xmath164 of the hot spots are located along the eastern half of the er , while spots toward that half of the ring are also closer to the sn than those to the west . both of these are suggestive of an er that is offset to the west of the sn , consistent with our findings in  [ sec - cs ] .",
    "an alternative interpretation to the hot spot positions and order of appearance is that the circumstellar medium into which the ejecta propagate is asymmetrically denser to the east @xcite .",
    "is such an imprint visible in light - echo data ?",
    "stellar winds propagating into uniform media travel faster and farther with increasing mechanical luminosity @xmath165 @xcite",
    ". a higher wind density to the east would imply that the cd boundary separating the rsg wind from the ms bubble should be more distant from the sn in that direction . in  [ sec - cd ] , we find that the cd does appear marginally offset from the sn toward the east .",
    "although by no means conclusive , this is suggestive that an eastern asymmetry was present in the stellar winds as early as the rsg .",
    "if the rsg outflows had been denser toward the east , then the inner cavity which the bsg wind carved out would be closer to the central star in that direction as well .",
    "this would have resulted in an observed er and cs hourglass that are offset west of the sn , and an overall density enhancement within the equatorial plane to the east .",
    "this qualitative argument is again consistent with the observed geometry of the inner cs structures (  [ sec - cs ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the inferred densities from  [ sec - density ] are too uncertain to permit a meaningful study of azimuthal asymmetries .    in keeping with the binary - star hypotheses to explain the observed cse , one could also invoke binarity as the cause for the east - west wind asymmetry .",
    "for example , a secondary in a resonant , eccentric orbit could tidally distort the primary when near pericenter , and from the von zeipel theorem ( 1924 ) , the radiative flux would temporarily drop at this distortion , with an associated local drop in wind momentum ( for a radiatively - driven wind ) , yielding a longitudinal wind asymmetry .",
    "another mechanism that could cause a longintudinally asymmetric wind is proper motion of the mass - losing star through the ism .",
    "this was first treated by @xcite and more recently by e.g.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "a slow , westward motion of the progenitor through the ism would pile up more material at the western wind - ism contact discontinuity than to the east .",
    "similarly , the star would be closer to this western discontinuity than to the west .",
    "such an effect has been seen for pne @xcite and for the lmc luminous blue variable s119 @xcite . a proper motion of less than 0.1 @xmath115is required to produce the observed offets , however , this scenario is predicated on the progenitor not blowing an ism bubble during its ms that is larger than any of the cs structures revealed in this paper .",
    "we look forward to a new generation of hydrodynamical models that will readdress the mechanisms of mass loss in sk @xmath166  202 , and subsequently the phenomena of bipolar mass loss in many more systems .    b.e.k.s . wishes to thank alex bergier , eric blackman , roger chevalier , adam frank , peter lundqvist , geralt mellema , and robert uglesich .",

    "<S> the 3-d geometry of the three circumstellar rings is studied , suggesting the northern and southern rings are located 1.3 and 1.0 ly from the sn , while the equatorial ring is elliptical ( @xmath0 ) , and spatially offset in the same direction as the hourglass . </S>",
    "<S> dust - scattering models of the observed echo fluxes suggest that between the hourglass and bipolar lobes : the gas density drops from 13 @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xmath1 ; the maximum dust - grain size increases from @xmath3to 2 ; and the silicate : carbonaceous dust ratio decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the nebulae have a total mass of @xmath4@xmath5 , yielding a red - supergiant mass loss around @xmath6 @xmath5  yr@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these results to current formation models , and find that no model has successfully reproduced this system . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results suggest a heuristic evolutionary sequence in which the progenitor evolves through two `` blue - loops , '' perhaps accompanied by a close binary companion . </S>"
