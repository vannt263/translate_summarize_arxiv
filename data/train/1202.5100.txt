    "solving of dirac equation in a curve spacetime is not a simple problem . at the moment we know only the solutions for a spinor field propagating on a curved background ( for details , see ref .",

    "the solutions describing a bound state of a charged particle on the background of either a black hole or a gravitational singular point will be physically interesting because they will describe bohr atom - like configuration created by electron wave function being in a strong gravitational field . in this case",
    "the electron undergoes a gravity attraction and coulomb attraction / repulsion created by gravitational mass and charge .",
    "the interesting questions arising in this connection are following : what force ( gravitational or coulomb ) influences more strongly on a charged particle , the influence of the event horizon for the existence of the solution and so on .",
    "let us note that at the moment not too much solutions of both dirac equation in a curve spacetime and self consistent solutions in einstein - dirac gravity are known .",
    "in the first case there are well known spinor solutions propagating on a curved background ref .",

    "there are cosmological solutions with a spinor field , see refs .",

    "but from we see that it should be @xmath19 why it happened ?",
    "why we have obtained two different dirac operators ? in our opinion it happens because we have an arbitrariness in the choice of dirac matrices @xmath16 .",
    "let us note that if we rewrite dirac operator in as @xmath20 \\frac{1}{r \\sqrt{\\sin\\theta } } =       i \\left (          \\gamma^0 \\partial_t + \\gamma^1 \\partial_r +           \\gamma^2 \\partial_\\theta +           \\gamma^3 \\partial_\\varphi      \\right ) \\label{2 - 30a}\\ ] ] then both dirac operators and are the same .",
    "it allows us to propose the following receipt .",
    "we introduce a canonical conjugated covariant derivative in the form @xmath21 where the operator @xmath22 is chosen in the form to do dirac equation invariant under the change of dirac matrices @xmath16 . in this case the canonical conjugated dirac equation is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the potential of the maxwell electromagnetic field .",

    "now we would like to investigate two cases : reissner - nordstrm black hole with @xmath46 and reissner - nordstrm naked singularity with @xmath47 .",
    "in this case we have two event horizons @xmath48 let us consider the behavior of the spinor field on the event horizon @xmath49 . from eq",
    "s we see that the spinor field near the event horizon have to be as following @xmath50 the substitution into gives us the constraint on the parameters @xmath51 @xmath52 from it follows that @xmath53 .",
    "it means that the condition of the wave function normalization will be destroyed because the corresponding integral @xmath54 diverges .      near the singularity @xmath55 the solution of eq s",
    "is given as @xmath56 where @xmath57 are constants .",
    "we will solve eq s numerically .",

    "[ fg ] the profiles of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are presented for attractive @xmath66 and repulsive @xmath67 cases .",
    "it is necessary to note that for both cases ( whether the coulomb interaction is attractive or repulsive ) we have the solution describing a bound state of a charged particle .",
    "it happens because the attractive gravitational interaction is much stronger the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is interesting to compare these solutions with bohr atom solution : the corresponding solution is presented in fig .",
    "[ fg ] also .    at the infinity",
    "eq s are @xmath68 whose asymptotical solution is @xmath69 which is the same as for the bohr atom solution because asymptotically the solution is controlled only by @xmath70 parameter .",
    "here we have considered relativistic quantum mechanics ( dirac equation ) on the reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "such consideration is very useful because it can shed light on the problem of quantum gravity .",
    "the matter is that quantum mechanics in a curved spacetime may have some problems and solving these problems may help to understand the problems arising the development of quantum gravity theory .",
    "the relativistic quantum mechanics on a curved background can be considered as a toy model for the investigation of quantum gravity problems .",
    "we have shown that there is some problems for using the spin connection formalism by the calculation with the dirac operator . in order to avoid these problems",
    "we have proposed to introduce a canonical conjugated covariant derivative .",
    "we think that in this case the dirac operator will be invariant under the choice of flat dirac matrices .    in our knowledge at the moment do not exist solutions describing a bound state of a relativistic charged particle with spin on the reissner - nordstrm background . here",
    "we have obtained solutions for dirac equation on the background of reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "we have shown that the solution does exist for the reissner - nordstrm naked singularity and does not exist for the reissner - nordstrm black hole",
    ". such solution describes a ground state of an electric charge placed in the reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "we see that this quantum state does exist whether the electric charge is positive or negative .",
    "it is explained by the fact that the gravitational attraction is much stronger coulomb repulsion / attraction .",
