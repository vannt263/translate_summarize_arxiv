    "in the rotating frame , and for slow rotations , the stationary solution in an elliptical trap is an elliptical condensate @xcite , with the size of the ellipticity depending not only on the trap ellipticity @xmath21 but also the rotation frequency @xmath1 .",
    "such a state can be reached by adiabatically ramping up the rotation frequency from @xmath41 to the chosen value , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this technique has been implemented experimentally @xcite . in our case , however , the rotation is suddenly turned on with frequency @xmath1 and maintained at this value .",

    "the two - fold symmetry of our system implies that only even angular momentum modes will be excited , and we expect the lowest order mode to dominate , i.e. the @xmath44 quadrupolar mode with frequency @xmath45 .",
    "when driven resonantly at half this frequency , i.e. at @xmath46 , this mode is predicted to be dynamically unstable @xcite , leading to vortex lattice formation .",

    "the times of the snapshots in ( a)-(b ) are indicated . , width=491 ]    we first consider the case of the stable quadrupolar mode .",
    "figure [ stable_quad](a)-(b ) shows the condensate density and phase throughout a cycle of the quadrupole oscillation for a rotation frequency @xmath56 .",
    "note that , due to the rotating trap , the two primary axes of the quadrupole continuously rotate over time at the rotation frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the condensate density initially has a circular shape . over time",
    "it becomes elongated ( figure [ stable_quad ] ( a)(i ) ) up to some maximum point ( figure [ stable_quad](a)(ii ) ) .",
    "the elongation then decreases ( figure [ stable_quad](a)(iii ) ) and the condensate returns to a circular state ( figure [ stable_quad](a)(iv ) ) .",
    "the phase distribution initially , and after one complete cycle , is uniform . as the condensate becomes elongated ( figure(b)(i)-(iii ) )",
    ", the phase develops a quadrupolar structure of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the rotating coordinates of the ellipse .",
    "this corresponds to a flow of fluid towards and away from the trap centre in different quadrants of the ellipse , as indicated by the arrows in figure [ stable_quad](b)(i)-(iii ) .",
    "although the condensate _ appears _ to be rotating , the combined effect of the quadrupole cycle and the rotation of the quadrupole axes ensures that the fluid remains irrotational at all times @xcite . when the condensate is highly elongated ( figure [ stable_quad](ii ) ) , the phase structure is dense , i.e. the fluid velocity is high , as required to maintain the irrotational flow .",
    "the condensate energy ( figure [ stable_quad](c ) ) oscillates sinusoidally at the quadrupole frequency @xmath60 between @xmath61 , representing the circular , ground state condensate , and a maximum value @xmath62 , corresponding to the fully elongated , excited state .",
    "this is analogous to a vortex cycling in and out of a condensate driven by a narrow optical stirrer @xcite , and to the rabi oscillations of an atom in a light field .",
    "note that the energy shows no additional behaviour : we do not detect higher order modes ( e.g. @xmath63 ) , and the orientation of the quadrupole ( oscillating at @xmath1 ) does not affect the energy .      the sinusoidal energy evolution in figure [ stable_quad](c ) is a general feature of the quadrupole mode , characterised by the quadrupole frequency @xmath60 and amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "we now examine the variation of these quantities with rotation frequency @xmath1 .",
    "first , consider the quadrupole frequency , shown in figure [ quad_mode](a ) . in the limit @xmath65",
    "the quadrupole frequency approaches @xmath66 , which corresponds to the analytic prediction in a non - rotating system @xcite . for a system rotating at frequency @xmath1",
    "the hamiltonian features an additional centrifugal term @xmath67 @xcite , where @xmath68 is the _ z_-component of the angular momentum .",
    "this adds a shift of @xmath69 to the dispersion relation . for the quadrupole @xmath44 mode",
    "this gives , @xmath70 this equation is plotted in figure [ stable_quad](a ) ( grey / brown line ) and fits the numerical data well for rotation frequencies away from the quadrupole resonance at @xmath71 .",
    "however , close to this resonance , the data deviates from the linear trend and never reaches zero .",
    "this is the unstable region of the quadrupolar mode , which ultimately leads to vortex lattice formation @xcite .",
    "note that the unstable regime lies in the vicinity of , but not necessarily centred around , the analytic prediction of @xmath72 .",
    "this shift is due to the elliptical perturbation on the system .",
    "the extent of this unstable region and how it compares to experimentals will be discussed in section [ sec : expts ] .",
    "the amplitude of the quadrupole mode , shown in figure [ quad_mode](b ) , increases towards the region of instability .",
    "close to and within this region , the amplitude becomes extremely large .",
    "the unstable quadrupole region is therefore associated with when the quadrupole mode has a frequency close to zero and a large amplitude .",
    "in the experiment of madison _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , lattice formation was observed in the region @xmath73 . below this",
    "no vortices were observed , while above this the condensate became turbulent .",

    ", we only count a vortex if it resides in a region of significant density , which we take to be where the density is greater than @xmath74 .",
    "this also avoids the counting of the phase singularities at very low density which have negligible energy .",
    "the range of rotation frequencies over which we observe lattice formation , @xmath75 , is comparable to the experimental observations . within this region , we observe the final number of vortices to increase with rotation frequency up to 12 vortices .    both below _ and above _ the lattice - forming region we observe stable quadrupolar oscillations , with no indication of a turbulent regime .",

    "fragmentation : : :    the quadrupole mode becomes over - excited and atoms are ejected .",
    "partial quadrupole oscillations occur ( where the condensate does not    fully return to its circular state ) , with the energy undergoing    partial oscillations . symmetry breaking and turbulence : : :    when the system asymmetry has grown to macroscopic levels the    quadrupole oscillations cease .",
    "energy is rapidly coupled into the    condensate up to some maximum value . at this point",
    "the condensate is a    turbulent state of vortices and sound waves .",
    "note it also returns to    having an approximately circular shape .",
    "crystallisation : : :    the total energy stays approximately constant , while vortex - sound    interactions allow the vortices to settle into a lattice    configuration .    as apparent in figure [ madison ] , the length of the fragmentation stage is highly sensitive to the trap rotation frequency . in the shortest case ( solid black line in figure [ madison ] ) , the fragmentation stage persists for a time of around @xmath91 ( or @xmath92ms ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the timescale for the symmetry - breaking / turbulent stage is insensitive to these effects , and typically extends for a time of around @xmath93 ( or @xmath94ms ) .",
    "the crystallisation phase in our simulations is also independent of these effects and remains a slow process , typically taking @xmath95 ( or @xmath96s ) to form a well - ordered lattice .",
    "+    in the experiments @xcite , the condensate is observed to undergo partial quadrupole oscillations ( where the condensate does not fully return to a circular state ) , become disordered , and finally form an ordered vortex lattice .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the stages of lattice formation described above .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the elliptical deformation of the condensate is measured as a function of time , and bears the same qualitative features as in figure [ madison](b ) .",
    "we now compare our simulations to the experimentally - observed timescales , where possible . in @xcite",
    ", the partial shape oscillations occur for approximately @xmath97ms .",
    "subsequently , the experimental shape oscillations cease and the condensate returns to an approximately circular shape .",
    "this occurs over a time of around @xmath98ms .",
    "these timescales are comparable with the quickest evolution in figure [ madison ] ( solid lines ) .    in the experiments , a lattice is observed after @xmath99s of trap rotation , where in our simulations @xcite it takes the equivalent of approximately 10 seconds for the lattice to become well - ordered .",
    "we have shown that the timescale for the fragmentation , symmetry - breaking and turbulent phases are consistent with experimental observations , and so this time anomaly must lie with the crystallisation phase .",
    "this discrepancy in the crystallisation rate may be due to thermal dissipation ( although results in section [ sec : thermal ] would contradict this ) or 3d effects such as kelvin wave excitation and damping @xcite , both of which are not present in our simulations .",
    "in the classical field interpretation @xcite , the gpe describes both the mean - field condensate _ and _ the fluctuating thermal field of random excitations .",
    "the thermal excitations typically have high energy and momenta in comparison to the condensate .",
    "as described in @xcite , an integral part of the lattice formation process is the irreversible generation of a highly - energetic outer cloud , which we will interpret as thermal atoms .",
    "the numerical grid on which the simulations are performed naturally imposes a momentum cutoff into the system . in our square 2d system , with isotropic grid spacing @xmath100 , the @xmath101-values are restricted to a square region @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "we employ an isotropic grid spacing @xmath104 , which is sufficiently small that it does not restrict directly the dynamics of the condensate",
    ". however , it will affect the thermal component of the system .",
    "high energy atoms will ` evaporate ' from the system when they exceed this cutoff .",
    "for example , consider the total energy and norm during the lattice formation process ( figure [ mom ] , solid black lines ) .",
    "the total norm does not visibly decrease , yet a very small proportion of thermal atoms are lost .",
    "these are the most energetic atoms , causing a gradual decrease in the energy at later times ( figure [ mom](a ) , solid black line ) .",
    "we investigate the role of the classical thermal cloud in the lattice formation process by varying the cutoff in _ k_-space . to impose a cutoff at @xmath105 ,",
    "we fourier transform into _",
    "k_-space , set @xmath106 for values which satisfy @xmath107 , and then inverse fourier transform to obtain the modified spatial wavefunction .",
    "this is repeated regularly throughout the simulation ( every 100 time steps ) .",
    "note that the imposed cutoff is circular in _",
    "k_-space , in contrast to the square cutoff induced by the grid .",
    "figure [ mom ] also shows the dynamics for various imposed circular cutoffs : @xmath108 ( grey / brown solid line ) , @xmath109 ( grey / brown dashed line ) , and @xmath110 ( grey / brown dotted line ) .",
    "these cases exhibit some common features . despite the reduction in the population of thermal atoms , a vortex lattice forms in all cases .",
    "importantly , the lattices contains approximately the same number of vortices ( figure [ mom](c ) ) .",
    "the peak condensate energy ( figure [ mom](a ) ) is slightly lower than the case of no imposed cutoff ( black line ) . in the crystallisation phase",
    "the energy decreases exponentially , and at a faster rate than the case of no imposed cutoff .",
    "similarly , for the norm ( figure [ mom](b ) ) , atoms are lost during the lattice formation process , and the rate of loss increases as the cutoff is reduced .",
    "these features are to be expected since lowering the cutoff ` evaporates ' more energetic atoms from the system .",
    "however , the number of vortices in the condensate does not visibly decrease , indicating that this energy / particle loss has little or no affect on the vortex dynamics in the central condensate .",
    "what is somewhat surprising is the significant difference in the energy curves between the square cutoff ( figure [ mom](a ) , black solid line ) and the circular cutoff with the same width ( figure [ mom](a ) , grey / brown solid line ) .",
    "clearly a large amount of energy must acculumate in the high-_k _ corners of _ k_-space .    for the imposed cutoffs , the energy has very similar dynamics , despite the large variations in the cutoff .",
    "in particular , the exponential decay of the energy during the crystallisation stage occurs on similar timescales .",
    "furthermore , the number of vortices in the final lattice is insensitive to the cutoff .",
    "this suggests that the formation of the lattice is independent of the number of thermal atoms , and therefore independent of temperature .",
    "experimental evidence to suggest that the crystallisation stage is temperature - independent has been presented in @xcite .",
    "so far we have considered a condensate in a trap which is under _ continuous _ rotation . here",
    "we study the effect of terminating the rotation after some time .",
    "we first consider the case of the stable quadrupole mode ( described in section [ sec : quad ] ) .",
    "this cycle is driven and maintained by the continuous trap rotation . terminating the rotation freezes the energy and elongation of the condensate .",
    "the quadrupole mode ceases although the elongated condensate stills rotates at the rotation frequency .",
    "+    figure [ termination ] presents results for the unstable quadrupole regime . here the energy for the case of continuous rotation ( black line ) is compared with cases where the rotation is turned off at various times ( grey / brown lines ) .",
    "once the rotation is terminated , no more energy can be coupled into the system , and the total energy becomes approximately fixed ( some energy is lost due to the finite momentum cutoff - see section [ sec : thermal ] ) . in all cases shown a vortex lattice is ultimately produced , including the case where the rotation is terminated after just one quadrupole oscillation .",
    "this implies that once the instability has been started , i.e. the fragmentation during the first quadrupole oscillation , the full vortex formation process will occur .",
    "an interesting effect of terminating the rotation is that , because the energy of the system becomes fixed , it allows control over the number of vortices in the final lattice .",
    "for example , under continuous rotation the final state in figure [ termination ] ( black line ) contains a maximum value of 11 vortices .",
    "however , for the cases where the rotation is terminated ( grey / brown lines ) the final state contains @xmath111 and @xmath112 vortices . in principle using this technique it should be possible to generate final lattices containing any number of vortices up to the maximum value .",
    "the fast rotation of condensates at the critical frequency @xmath113 and above is of current interest , with the prospect of ultimately generating exotic phenomena such as vortex melting and a quantum hall state of bosons @xcite . for a gas of classical non - interacting particles under critical rotation",
    "the centrifugal force equals the trapping force , and the particles are no longer confined @xcite .",
    "super - critical rotation has been studied experimentally in a harmonic trap featuring an additional quartic term to avoid this singularity @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated critical rotation in a rotating trap both experimentally and theoretically , and showed that , while the non - interacting ( non - condensed ) gas explodes , repulsive interactions can hold the condensate together .",
    "this occurs if the trap ellipticity does not exceed a critical value ( of the order of @xmath114 ) .",
    "then the centre of mass of the condensate is destabilised and spirals away from the trap centre . however , if @xmath21 exceeds the critical value , the condensate also undergoes explosive dynamics .",

    "is predicted to be @xmath121 , giving @xmath122 , which is in good agreement with our observations .",
    "the irregular centre - of - mass motion occurs in the lower part of this range , for @xmath123 , where the condensate is excited to the highest energies .    above this critical region ,",
    "the centre - of - mass oscillations cease and the dominant excitation in the condensate returns to being the quadrupole mode , albeit with very low amplitude ( see figure [ quad_mode ] ) .",
    "we have also considered the critical rotation of a condensate which contains vortices , both by forming a vortex lattice at @xmath3 and suddenly switching the rotation to @xmath113 , and by slowly ramping the rotation , through the unstable regime , up to @xmath113 . in both cases , we observe the condensate to undergo centre - of - mass oscillations in the trap",
    ". however , here the oscillating condensate typically has a diffuse and disordered appearance , and contains several vortices .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamics of an atomic bose - einstein condensate in a weakly - elliptical rotating trap using the two - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this was performed over a wide range of rotation frequencies relevant to current experiments .",
    "the quadrupole mode of the condensate plays a key role in the dynamics , with the fate of the system depending crucially on the rotation frequency .",
    "we resolve the stable and unstable regimes of the quadrupole oscillations .",
    "the unstable regime occurs around the resonant frequency of the quadrupole mode , @xmath124 , and rotation within this range ultimately leads to vortex lattice formation . indeed , over the large range of rotations investigated here , we only observe vortex nucleation to occur within this range , i.e. vortex nucleation in elliptical traps only occurs through the dynamical instability of the quadrupole mode .",
    "we compare with lattice experiments and find good qualitative , and sometimes quantitative , agreement , despite the limitations of the model we employ ( two - dimensional and zero - temperature ) .",
    "this reinforces the idea that lattice formation is at heart a two - dimensional effect .",
    "furthermore , we find that the process is insensitive to the cutoff of ` thermal ' atoms in the system , suggesting that lattice formation is a zero - temperature phenomenon .    by terminating the trap rotation during the lattice formation process",
    "we show that it is possible to control the number of vortices in the final lattice . finally , we considered the response of the system to critical rotation at the trap frequency , and observe large centre - of - mass oscillations of the condensate , without the explosive dynamics expected for a classical particle .",
