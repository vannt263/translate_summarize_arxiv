    "@xmath5 let @xmath0 be an integer , such that @xmath6 .",
    "the weak symmetry breaking task for @xmath0 processes is an  inputless task , where the possible outputs are @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a  distributed protocol is said to solve the weak symmetry breaking task if in any execution without failed processes , there exists at least one process which has value @xmath7 as well as at least one process which has value @xmath8 .    in the classical setting ,",
    "the processes know their i d s , and are allowed to compare them .",
    "it is however not allowed that any other information about i d s is used .",
    "the protocols with this property are called _ comparison - based_. in practice this means that behavior of each process only depends on the relative position of its i d among the i d s of the processes it witnesses and not on its actual numerical value . as a  special case , we note that each process must output the same value in case he does not witness other processes at all .",
    "weak symmetry breaking is a standard task in theoretical distributed computing , and its solvability in the standard computational models is a  sophisticated question which has been extensively studied .    for the rest of this paper we shall fix the computational model to be the layered immediate snapshot model , see  @xcite .",
    "in this model the processes use two atomic operations being performed on shared memory .",
    "these operations are : _ write _ into the register assigned to that process , and _ snapshot read _ , which reads entire memory in one atomic step . furthermore , it is assumed that the executions are well - structured in the sense that they must satisfy the two following conditions .",
    "first , it is only allowed that at each time a  group of processes gets active , these processes perform a  write operation together , and then they perform a  snapshot read operation together ; no other interleaving in time of the write and read operations is permitted .",
    "such executions are called _ immediate snapshot _ executions .",
    "second , each execution can be broken up in rounds , where in every round each non - faulty process gets activated precisely once .",
    "even though this computational model is seemingly quite restrictive , it has been proved , see , e.g. , @xcite , that most of the commonly used shared memory computational models are equivalent , in the sense of which of the tasks are solvable , to this one .",
    "as we will see , this model has the major advantage that the protocol complexes have a comparatively simple topological structure .",
    "@xmath5 several groups of researchers have studied the solvability of the weak symmetry breaking by means of comparison - based layered immediate snapshot protocols . due to primarily work of castaeda and rajsbaum , @xcite , it is known that the weak symmetry breaking is solvable if and only if the number of processes is not a  prime power ; see also @xcite for a  counting - based argument for the impossibility part .",
    "this makes @xmath9 the smallest number of processes for which this task is solvable .",
    "the combinatorial structures arising in related questions on subdivisions of simplex paths have been studies in @xcite .",
    "the specific case @xmath9 has been studied in @xcite , who has proved the existence of the distributed protocol which solves the weak symmetry breaking task in 17 rounds .",
    "we refer to the classical textbook  @xcite , as well as the more recent monograph @xcite , for general background on theoretical distributed computing , and specifically on impossibility results .",
    "a  general reference for topological methods in distributed computing is  @xcite . a  general reference for combinatorial topology is  @xcite .",
    "finally , we recommend the survey @xcite for background on symmetry breaking tasks .",
    "@xmath5    our main mathematical result is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : main - math ] there exists a compliant binary labeling @xmath10 of the vertices of @xmath11 , such that the restriction of @xmath10 to any @xmath12-simplex of @xmath11 is surjective .",
    "this immediately implies the following theorem in theoretical distributed computing .",
    "[ thm : main - cs ] there exists a  comparison - based layered immediate snapshot distributed protocol solving the weak symmetry breaking task for @xmath3 processes in @xmath4 rounds .",
    "we also present the associated explicit distributed protocol .",
    "because of the standard reduction to a mathematical question , see theorem  [ thm : red ] , we can derive theorem  [ thm : main - cs ] as a  direct corollary of our main mathematical statement given in theorem  [ thm : main - math ] .",
    "our central method is the in - depth analysis of the simplicial structure of the second chromatic subdivision of a  simplex . to this end",
    ", we need to develop the apropriate combinatorial language , in order to formalize and to work with standard chromatic subdivisions .",
    "this is done in sections  [ sect:2 ] and  [ sect:3 ] , yielding as a  byproduct the combinatorial framework which is applicable in a  much bigger generality .",
    "once the combinatorics is clear , the plan of our proof is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sect:4 ] , we define some specially designed binary labeling on the vertices of the second chromatic subdivision of @xmath13 , calling this the _ initial labeling_. this labeling is compliant , but it has many 1-monochromatic 5-simplices . in the next step , we find a  perfect matching on the set of 1-monochromatic 5-simplices , such that whenever two 5-simplices are matched , they share a  4-simplex .    in section  [ sect:4 ] we describe the standard matching , which is easy to define , but which is not perfect . in section  [ sect:5 ]",
    "we modify this standard matching by connecting unmatched simplices by augmenting paths .",
    "this is a  standard technique from matching theory , and it yields a  perfect matching .",
    "once we have a  perfect matching , it is easy to use that to achieve a  binary compliant labeling of the vertices of @xmath11 without any monochromatic simplices .",
    "this is done in the end of section  [ sect:5 ] , and it proves our main theorem  [ thm : main - math ] .",
    "the remaining two sections are dealing with further specific issues . the explicit protocol for solving weak symmetry breaking task for @xmath3 processes in @xmath4 rounds",
    "is given in section  [ sect:5 ] .",
    "we finish with section  [ sect:6 ] , where we give a  very short argument for impossibility of solving weak symmetry breaking task in @xmath8 round for any number of processes .",
    "while the focus of this paper has been on the case of 6 processes , it is possible to refine our analysis to a  much more general setting , yielding new bounds for the symmetry breaking function , as well as producing distributed protocols for other numbers of processes .",
    "however , there is a  number of technical issues which need to be resolved , and there is a  number of new ideas which need to be introduced , since giving the simplex paths explicitely , as was done in table  [ table:21paths ] , is prohibitive for higher values of  @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , the extension of the techniques from this paper to higher values of @xmath0 will appear in a  separate article , see  @xcite .",
