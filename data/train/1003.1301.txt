    "transiting extrasolar planets are the vip s ( very important planets ) of the extrasolar planet community ( exoplanets ) , being the key to the understanding of the physics and various processes in the interior and atmospheres of substellar objects .",
    "the orientation of their orbits in space with respect to the observer is so fortunate that they allow us to observe the transit of the planet in front of the parent star as a dip in the light curve .",
    "photometric observations of these transits ( in combination with spectroscopy ) provide us with important parameters of the system : orbital period , inclination , mass and radius of the planet .",
    "the planet radius is a complicated function of the planet mass , age , chemical composition as well as properties of its orbit and the parent star ( guillot & showman 2002 , burrows et al .",

    "wasp-10b is one of the 80 so far known transiting extrasolar planets ( schneider , 1995 ) . it was discovered in 2008 by the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) consortium ( christian et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the exoplanet orbits the parent star gsc 2752 - 00114 ( spectral type k5 ) at the distance of 0.0369au and has the mass of @xmath8 ( christian et al .",
    "wasp-10b has one of the deepest transit depth , cca 39mmag ( poddany et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this results in the planet radius of about @xmath9 ( christian et al .",
    "this radius is quite large and an additional internal heat source is required to understand such large radii .",
    "unfortunately , their most precise observations do not cover the whole transit events .",
    "soon after the discovery the properties of the exoplanet were revisited by johnson et al .",
    "they obtained superb observations with the uh 2.2 m telescope which covered the whole transit and significantly improved the precision of the radius determination .",
    "however , contrary to the discovery paper , they determined a very different radius of the planet : @xmath10 , which is 16 percent smaller than that given in the discovery paper .",
    "the origin of the difference was not entirely clear . nevertheless , the new radius is consistent with previously published theoretical radii for irradiated jovian planets .",
    "miller et al . ( 2009 ) could explain its new radius without any additional heat sources .",
    "our observations were made with the newton 508/2500 mm telescope with the ccd camera sbig st10 xme in r band ( ubvri system ) .",
    "the telescope is located in star lesn in the high tatra mountains in slovakia .",
    "the transiting system was observed during four nights  4/11/08 , 31/8/09 , 4/10/09 and 7/10/09 ( dd / mm / yy ) .",
    "the time base for our observations was provided by the gps device motorola - oncore m12+t .",
    "we performed the standard correction procedure ( bias , dark and flat field correction ) and subsequently aperture photometry with our data using the c - munipack software package .",
    "we carefully chose a few comparison stars and created one `` artificial '' comparison star for each image as an average of individual fluxes of all comparison stars . by means of such procedure",
    "we obtain a @xmath11 accuracy of about 3 - 5mmag per 1 ccd exposure depending on observing conditions .",
    "we also removed the linear trend in the out - of - transit data .",
    "the resulting light curves from the four nights are depicted in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "to obtain an analytical transit light curve we used the formulae from mandel & agol ( 2002 ) assuming the quadratic limb darkening in the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface , @xmath14 is the intensity at the place defined by @xmath13 , @xmath15 is the intensity at the center of the disk and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the coefficients of limb darkening .",
    "the limb darkening coefficients were linearly interpolated from claret ( 2000 ) for the following star parameters : @xmath18=4675k , @xmath19 and @xmath20=0.0 $ ] ( based on the results of christian et al .",
