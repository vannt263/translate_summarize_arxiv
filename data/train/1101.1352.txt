    "the study of correlated electrons on honeycomb lattice has attracted much interest recently .",
    "the honeycomb lattice has the smallest possible coordinate number of 3 for a two dimensional lattice and hosts dirac - type dispersion at half filling .",
    "it is interesting to understand how the electron correlation effect will manifest itself in such a background .",
    "a comparison with the square lattice case is of particular interest .",
    "both lattices are bipartite and the antiferromagnetic long range order is unfrustrated in the strongly correlated limit .",
    "however , at half filling , the honeycomb lattice has a dirac - type dispersion and a finite correlation strength is needed to induce antiferromagnetic order on honeycomb lattice , while on square lattice , the system form antiferromagnetic long range order immediately as we turn on interaction as the half filled system has a nested fermi surface .",
    "more recently , it is discovered that the transition from the semimetal phase to the antiferromagnetic ordered state on honeycomb lattice may take place in a two step manner , leaving a small but finite intermediate correlation range in which the system may enter a spin liquid state with unconventional characteristics@xcite .    on square lattice , the antiferromagnetic order is destroyed by charge carrier doping .",
    "the resultant state is believed to have d - wave superconducting pairing and may be responsible for the superconductivity of the high-@xmath5 cuprates . what is the analogy of these doping effect for the correlated electron system on honeycomb lattice ?",
    "more specifically , what is the pairing symmetry of the resultant superconducting state , provided that the doped system does enter some kind of unconventional superconducting state .",
    "this inquire is even more attractive on honeycomb lattice than on square lattice , as the undoped honeycomb system already show signature of spin liquid ground state , which is nothing but a undoped version of the pairing state , the rvb state .",
    "superconductivity on system with a honeycomb lattice , especially that on graphene , has been studied by many researchers from both theoretical and experimental perspectives@xcite .",
    "however , in most of these studies , the electron correlation effect does not play an essential role and the related pairing state has either s - wave or extended s - wave pairing symmetry , originated from exchanging phonon or other excitations .",
    "when the electron correlation effect is taken into account , the chiral d - wave pairing state@xcite has been proposed as a generalization of the d - wave pairing state on square lattice to honeycomb lattice(see fig.1 ) .",
    "however , it is not clear how the time reversal symmetry broken chiral state are connected to the antiferromagnetic ordered state at half filling .    at this point",
    ", it is quite useful to recall how the pairing symmetry of the superconducting state is determined in the strong correlation limit on square lattice . here",
    ", a rvb state called staggered flux phase is found to be the best variational state at half filling in the restricted space of fermionic rvb state@xcite , although it is known that the half filled system inevitably has an antiferromagnetic long range order .",
    "the staggered flux phase has the virtue that the antiferromagnetic short range correlation is greatly improved by the introduction of a non zero staggered flux .",
    "up to a su(2 ) gauge transformation , the introduction of the staggered flux is found to be equivalent to the introduction of d - wave pairing between the fermionic spinons , especially , when the pairing and hoping order parameter becomes identical , the staggered flux becomes @xmath1 . for general value of the staggered flux ,",
    "the pairing amplitude and the flux is related by the relation @xmath6 .",
    "it is thus quite natural that the doped system will choose the d - wave pairing state as its superconducting state as the antiferromagnetic superexchange is already optimized by the staggered flux .",
    "thus , a natural questions arises as what is the analog of the staggered flux phase on the honeycomb lattice , which can hopefully improve the superexchange interaction by some kind of pairing(flux ) . however , except for the @xmath1-flux phase , a naive generalization the staggered flux pattern for general flux value to the honeycomb lattice is impossible as a result of the geometric frustration between the neighboring hexagonal plaquette(see fig .",
    "such a difference with square lattice originates from the frustrated nature of the dual lattice of the honeycomb lattice , which is the triangular lattice .",
    "thus a generalization of the staggered flux phase to honeycomb lattice in the space of @xmath3 staggered flux is impossible .",
    "however , generalization of the staggered flux phase in the larger space of @xmath7 flux is still possible . in this paper",
    ", we show that the rvb state with chiral d - wave pairing just fit such a need .",
    "more specifically , we show that the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice can be taken as a generalized staggered flux phase .",
    "it actually describes a spin liquid state with the full symmetry of the heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice and evolves in exactly the same way as the staggered flux phase on square lattice as a function of the parameter @xmath0(see fig.3 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 , the state reduces to the uniform rvb state on honeycomb lattice , which has dirac - type spinon dispersion . when @xmath9 , the state is gauge equivalent to the @xmath1 flux phase on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "when @xmath10 exceed @xmath11 and approaches infinite , the state again evolves back to the uniform rvb state with zero flux .",
    "it is interesting to note that in an earlier work on symmetric spin liquid state on honeycomb lattice , the chiral d - wave rvb state is classified to be a z@xmath12 spin liquid in the neighborhood of the uniform rvb state@xcite . as its cousin on square lattice",
    ", the introduction of the staggered flux improves the antiferromagnetic correlation and we find the chiral d - wave rvb state stands as a rather good variational state for the heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice . unlike the staggered flux phase on square lattice , for general flux value , the mean field ansatz for the chiral d - wave rvb state posses a @xmath4 rather than @xmath3 gauge structure .",
    "we also find that as a result of the bipartite nature of the lattice , both the staggered flux phase on square lattice and the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice satisfy the marshall sign rule for unfrustrated antiferromagnet .",
    "such sign structure will prohibit the system to show topological degeneracy in the @xmath4 sense , no matter what is the gauge structure of the mean field ansatz for the rvb state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next two sections",
    ", we will review some well known results about the rvb state in general and the staggered flux phase on square lattice in particular to set up the stage for our discussion . in section iv",
    ", we present our results for the chiral d - wave rvb state .",
    "section v contains a detailed comparison between the staggered flux phase on square lattice and the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb and a discussion of some related issues .         staggered flux on the honeycomb lattice.,width=302 ]",
    "the rvb states studied in this paper are those derived form gutzwiller projection of bcs - type mean field ground state of the following general mean field ansatz@xcite @xmath13 in which @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "eq.(1 ) can also be taken as the saddle point approximation of a field theoretical description of the rvb state , in which @xmath17 and @xmath18 are interpreted as two types of rvb order parameters . in the field",
    "theoretical formulation , the gutzwiller projection into the subspace of no double occupancy amounts to integrating over the time component of the gauge fluctuation .",
    "it is important to note that within the subspace of no double occupancy , a description of the rvb state in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 becomes redundant as a result of the gauge degree of freedom in the mean field ansatz@xcite .",
    "such redundancy is accompanied by an underlying gauge structure of the rvb state so constructed . to see more clearly , it is better to rewrite the mean field ansatz in the nambu form @xmath19",
    "in which @xmath20 is a two component spinor .",
    "@xmath21 is a @xmath22 matrix .",
    "it is clear then that the system is invariant under the following @xmath7 gauge transformation @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is a site - dependent @xmath7 matrix .",
    "as only the @xmath7 gauge singlet survive the gutzwiller projection , @xmath25 and @xmath26 actually describes the same rvb state .",
    "although @xmath25 is not gauge invariant and thus unphysical , it does contains important gauge invariant information on the structure of the rvb state . to uncover such internal gauge structure of the rvb state",
    ", it is a common practice to construct the loop operators@xcite , @xmath27 , in which @xmath28 denotes the starting point of the loop @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the remaining sites along the loop . under the @xmath7 gauge transformation ,",
    "a loop operator transform as @xmath31 and thus its trace form a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "a rvb state is called to have @xmath7 gauge structure if all loop operator are proportional to the identity matrix @xmath32 .",
    "otherwise , it is called to have a @xmath3 gauge structure if all @xmath33 starting from any given site @xmath28 commute with each other .",
    "if there are more than two loop operators starting from the same site do not commute with each other , the rvb state is called to have @xmath4 gauge structure .",
    "the gauge structure of the rvb state is closely related to the existence of soft gauge mode in the long wave length limit in the effective field theoretic description of the rvb state .",
    "for example , if the gauge structure of the rvb state is @xmath7 , then there will be @xmath7 soft gauge mode in the long wave length limit . while if the gauge structure of rvb state is @xmath4 , then there is no soft gauge mode at all in the long wave length limit .",
    "in such a case , the predictions made at the level of saddle point approximation is believed to be more reliable than those cases in which the rvb state has a @xmath3 or @xmath7 gauge structure .",
    "in addition , the system with @xmath4 gauge structure is argued in the effective field theory to support topological order and topological degeneracy - existence of degenerate ground states that can not be differentiated from any local probe@xcite .",
    "the rvb state is generated from gutzwiller projection of the bcs - type mean field ground state @xmath34 such a state can in general be rewritten in the form of condensed spin singlet pairs @xmath35 in which @xmath36 is the so called rvb amplitude and satisfy the relation @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the number of lattice site . as gauge",
    "equivalent mean field ansatz @xmath25 lead to identical rvb state , a rvb state is said to be symmetric if and only if the new ansatz after symmetry transformation is gauge equivalent to the old one .",
    "the projective symmetry group(psg ) provides a convenient scheme to classify the symmetric rvb state@xcite .    for rvb state with @xmath4 gauge structure , which is argued to posses topological degeneracy from effective field theory , a @xmath4 topological excitation called vison",
    "can be constructed by reversing the sign of rvb amplitude on bonds that crossing a branch cut line originated from the center of the vison an odd number of times .",
    "the topological nature of the vison excitation can be seen from the fact it acts as a @xmath1 flux tube located at its origin for spinon traveling around it .",
    "especially , when the rvb state is defined on a torus and a vison is trapped in one of the holes of the torus , one is left with a state that globally distinct from , but locally indistinguishable(and thus degenerate in the thermodynamic limit ) from the original rvb state .",
    "this is nothing but the topological degeneracy .",
    "however , on bipartite lattice , the topological degeneracy predicted by the effective field theory can be lifted as a result of some special phase structure on the rvb state .",
    "the detection of the @xmath4 topological degeneracy is simplified by the fact that trapping a vison in the holes of the torus is gauge equivalent to change to boundary condition from periodic to anti - periodic or vice versa in the mean field ansatz@xcite .",
    "thus to see if a particular rvb state does posses topological degeneracy in practice , we only need to calculate the overlap between rvb states generated from mean field ansatz with different boundary conditions around the holes of the torus and extrapolate the result to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if the overlap extrapolate to zero in the thermodynamic limit , then the rvb state is said to posses topological degeneracy .",
    "the staggered flux phase(or d - wave rvb state ) on square lattice plays a very important role in our understanding of the high - t@xmath39 superconductivity in cuprates . in the following",
    "we will review briefly some of the most important properties of this state@xcite for a comparison with the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice .",
    "the staggered flux phase on square lattice is generated from the following mean field ansatz @xmath40 in which the phase factor @xmath41 is introduced to guarantee that each plaquette of the square lattice is threaded by a @xmath3 flux of value @xmath42 arranged in a staggered pattern .",
    "although the mean field ansatz breaks the time reversal symmetry for general value of @xmath43 , it is well known that the staggered flux phase is gauge equivalent to the d - wave rvb state generated from the following time reversal symmetric d - wave bcs mean field ansatz @xmath44 in which @xmath45 for nearest neighboring sites @xmath28 and @xmath46 in the x / y direction . here",
    "both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real and is determined from @xmath43 by @xmath49 in the following , we will use the d - wave gauge .",
    "the spinon excitation spectrum in the staggered flux phase has the dirac - type linear dispersion and is given by @xmath50 , in which @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the nodes are located at @xmath53 . as we will be concerned with the spin structure factor of the rvb state below",
    ", we present the mean field prediction for it here .",
    "the spin structure factor is defined as @xmath54 the spin structure factor in a bcs mean field ground state is given by @xmath55 since the square lattice is bipartite and @xmath56 , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , we find @xmath59 in the mean field theory .",
    "the spin structure factor is thus independent of the value of the staggered flux in the mean field theory .",
    "it also extrapolates to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the loop operator around the elementary plaquette of the square lattice in the staggered flux phase is given by @xmath60 in which @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "here @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the three pauli matrixes in the internal @xmath7 space .",
    "when @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath68 , the loop operator is proportional to @xmath69(here we assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath70 ) . by induction we can show that all loop operators are proportional to @xmath69 at these three points .",
    "the state with @xmath68 and that with @xmath66 are in fact gauge equivalent and is the well known uniform rvb state on square lattice .",
    "the state with @xmath67 is the so called @xmath1-flux phase on square lattice .",
    "thus , both the uniform rvb state and the @xmath1-flux phase posses a @xmath7 gauge structure . for general value of the staggered flux ,",
    "the loop operator is not proportional to @xmath69 and gauge structure can be shown to be @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of the gauge structure with @xmath0 in the staggered flux phase is summarized in fig.3(a ) .",
    "the staggered flux actually respects all the physical symmetries of the heisenberg model on square lattice .",
    "while translational symmetry and inversion symmetry is manifest in the d - wave gauge , the four - fold lattice rotational symmetry can be shown as follows .    under the four - fold lattice rotation ,",
    "the mean field ansatz transform as follows : @xmath71 , @xmath72 . a global @xmath7 gauge transformation with @xmath73 suffices to recover the original ansatz .",
    "the rotated ansatz and the original ansatz thus describe the same rvb state .",
    "this prove the rotational symmetry of the staggered flux phase .",
    "the four - fold rotational symmetry of the staggered flux also implies the gauge equivalence between the state with staggered flux @xmath43 and @xmath74 .",
    "as the gauge flux is defined modula @xmath75 , the state with staggered flux @xmath43 and @xmath76 are gauge equivalent . in the d - wave gauge",
    ", this indicates that the state with @xmath77 and the state with @xmath78 are gauge equivalent .      in an ising basis for the spins ,",
    "the staggered flux phase can be expanded as follows @xmath79 in which @xmath80 denotes an ising basis . then the wave function @xmath81 can be shown to be real and satisfy the marshall sign rule@xcite for unfrustrated antiferromagnet , namely , the sign of @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 , with @xmath84 denoting the number of down spins in @xmath85 sublattice .",
    "although the mean field ansatz of the staggered flux phase has at least a @xmath3 gauge structure , it is still possible to construct a state with a trapped vison in the holes of a torus and check its orthogonality with the state with no trapped vison .",
    "such a calculation has been done in previous studies@xcite and it was found that the overlap extrapolates to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit , indicating no topological degeneracy for the staggered flux phase .",
    "this result is claimed to be a strong support of the effective field theory argument .",
    "however , a later investigation@xcite indicates that the marshall sign rule satisfied by the staggered flux phase plays a more essential role in removing the topological degeneracy .",
    "both the short range and the long range spin correlation are seen to reach extreme at the uniform rvb state and the @xmath1-flux phase .",
    "this is a result of the gauge equivalence between states with staggered flux @xmath43 and @xmath74 and that between states with staggered flux @xmath43 and @xmath76 , from which one can easily show that the spin correlation function should reach their extreme in the uniform rvb state and the @xmath1-flux phase .",

    "in fig.6 , we present the result for @xmath90 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the spin structure factor decrease monotonically with the staggered flux for @xmath91 .",
    "the small peak close to the uniform rvb state is a finite size effect and it moves toward the uniform rvb state with increasing lattice size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit .    in a recent work@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the uniform rvb state on square lattice actually describe a state with antiferromagnetic long range order as a result of the nested spinon fermi surface .",

    "the staggered flux has no magnetic long range order and the spin correlation function decay algebraically with distance with an exponent depending on the value of the staggered flux .",

    "it is also argued that the marshall sign structure will remove from the projected wave function the topological degeneracy , even if the mean field ansatz has a @xmath4 gauge structure .",
    "the absence of the topological degeneracy on bipartite system can be argued as follows . as changing",
    "the boundary condition around the hole of a tours will not change the bipartite nature of the mean field ansatz , both the projected state with trapped vison and without trapped vison will be positive definite in the sense of marshall sign rule .",
    "it is just this insensitivity of the sign structure to the trapped @xmath4 gauge flux that is responsible for the absence of the topological degeneracy . in a recent work@xcite",
    ", we have shown through vmc that the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice does not support topological degeneracy .",

    "such oscillation is caused by the complex nodal structure of the chiral d - wave rvb state , which move continuously in the momentum space with @xmath0 .",

    ", the difference in energy between the uniform rvb state and the optimized variational state in this class of rvb state is seen to be small .",
    "as the exact ground state energy is estimated to be @xmath166 per site from exact diagonalizition studies@xcite , we see the chiral d - wave rvb state in fact represents a rather good variational state for the heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice .",
    "the spin structure factor at the antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector for the chiral d - wave rvb state is plotted in fig.13 as a function of @xmath0 . as a comparison we also plot the value calculated from the mean field ground state(@xmath167 ) , which is independent of the pairing strength .",
    "the spin structure factor is seen to be reduced at the uniform rvb state and the @xmath1 flux phase , both of which having a @xmath7 gauge structure at the mean field level .",
    "this can be taken as a evidence that the @xmath7 gauge fluctuation will reduce rather than enhance the spin correlation .",
    "we have also calculated the size dependence of the spin structure factor at @xmath66 , @xmath168 and @xmath2 to see how the gauge structure affects the spin correlation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the results are shown in fig.14 .",
    "we find in all of the three states the spin structure factor decay algebraically with the linear scale of the lattice , indicating no magnetic long range order in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is different from square lattice , where the uniform rvb state is found to posses antiferromagnetic long range order .",
    "a fit to the date with the formula @xmath169 shows that the exponent @xmath170 varies with the value of @xmath0 .",

    "it is reduced to @xmath172 at @xmath168 and return to @xmath173 at @xmath2 .",

    "from the above discussion , we see the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice indeed stands as a natural generalization of the staggered flux phase on square lattice .",
    "the two states shares the following properties .",
    "\\(1 ) both states respect the full symmetry of the heisenberg model on respective lattices and have a positive definite wave function in the sense of the marshall sign rule .",
    "\\(2 ) both states evolves with @xmath0 in the same manner . with the increase of @xmath0 , both states evolve from the uniform rvb state to the @xmath1-flux phase and then back to the uniform rvb state .",
    "the uniform rvb state and the @xmath1-flux phase on both lattices have a promoted gauge symmetry of @xmath7 .",
    "( 3)the introduction of the gauge flux on both lattice improves the short range spin correlation and both the staggered flux phase on square lattice and the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice are rather good variational description of the heisenberg model on respective lattices .",
    "( 4)as a result of the bipartite nature of the lattice and the resultant marshall sign rule of the rvb state , both the staggered flux phase on square lattice and the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice do not support topological degeneracy , although the latter posses a @xmath4 gauge structure at the saddle point level .    however , there are also important differences between the staggered flux phase on square lattice and the chiral d - wave rvb state on honeycomb lattice .",
    "the following is a list of the main differences .",
    "( 1)on square lattice , the intermediate state connecting the uniform rvb state and the @xmath1-flux phase has a @xmath3 gauge structure .",
    "however , on honeycomb lattice , the two states are connected by intermediate state with @xmath4 gauge structure .",
    "this difference originates from the frustrated nature of the dual lattice of honeycomb lattice .",
    "related with this difference is the difference in the staggering pattern of the gauge flux on the two lattices . on square lattice , the gauge flux form a two sublattice collinear pattern . on the other hand , the gauge flux on the honeycomb lattice form a three sublattice non - collinear pattern .",
    "( 2)as a result of the non - collinear nature of the gauge flux in the chiral d - wave state , the states with gauge flux @xmath43 below @xmath2 are not gauge equivalent to the states with gauge flux @xmath76 above @xmath2 , except the special case of the uniform rvb state .",
    "thus in principle the @xmath1-flux phase on honeycomb lattice need not be a extreme of physical properties as functions of @xmath0 , although we find both the variational energy and the spin structure factor do reach their extreme at the @xmath1-flux phase . on the other hand , on square lattice , the @xmath1-flux phase must be an extreme of physical properties as functions of @xmath0 as protected by the @xmath174 symmetry .",
    "( 3)on square lattice , the uniform rvb state posses antiferromagnetic long range order .",
    "however , on honeycomb lattice , no magnetic order is detected in the uniform rvb state .",
    "this difference can be induced by the difference in their spinon dispersion .",
    "while the uniform rvb state on square lattice has a large and nested spinon fermi surface , which is unstable toward antiferromagnetic ordering , the uniform rvb state on honeycomb lattice has an isotropic dirac - type spinon dispersion , just as the @xmath1-flux phase on square lattice .",
    "indeed , the spin structure factor of the uniform rvb state on honeycomb lattice is found to show the same scaling behavior as the @xmath1-flux phase on square lattice@xcite .",
    "( 4)although the variational energy can be improved by introducing gauge flux on both square lattice and honeycomb lattice , the amount of improvement is quite different . on square lattice , the introduction of staggered flux will lead to a @xmath175 improvement in the variational energy of the heisenberg model . on the other hand ,",
    "the same energy gain on honeycomb lattice is less than @xmath176 .",
    "this difference can also be induced by the difference in the spinon dispersion on the two lattices .",
    "as the staggered flux phase plays such a central role in our understanding of the high - tc superconductivity in cuprates from the perspective of rvb theory , it is quite natural to expect that the chiral d - wave rvb state will play the similar role , if the doped honeycomb system in the strongly correlated regime does support some kind of superconductivity . after doping ,",
    "the time reversal symmetry will be broken and the state will become truly chiral .",
    "a full gap will also be opened in the doped system , as can be shown by including a chemical potential term in eq.(13 ) .",
    "there will be many interesting issues concerning this novel superconducting state , especially on its topological properties .",
    "however , as the condensation energy is much smaller than system on square lattice , the superconductivity on the honeycomb system should be weaker than high t@xmath39 cuprates .",
    "it is interesting to see if this state can be realized in experiment .",
