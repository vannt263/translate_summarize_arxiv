    "hence , eq .   shows that strong local fluctuations induce a pairing among electrons .",
    "this argument is valid in the case of weak interactions , where no local moments are formed . in this regime ,",
    "the relation @xmath92 holds ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the main text for the definition of @xmath93 ) .        in the above argument",
    ", the local susceptibility can be identified as the magnetic and charge susceptibilities , which have the same value in the weak - coupling limit . with increasing repulsive coulomb interactions ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is enhanced and the charge one is suppressed . hence we expect that in the regime considered in the main text , the local magnetic fluctuations primarily contribute to the pairing among electrons in the multi - orbital hubbard model . indeed our dmft+ctqmc calculations demonstrate a clear connection between superconductivity and local spin susceptibility .",
    "we note that the present discussion can not be applied to the local - moment regime with @xmath94 . in this case",

    "[ fig : interaction](c , d ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are not much modified , while @xmath91 is strongly reduced with increasing fluctuations and finally becomes attractive .",

    "we also define the fourier transformation with respect to time by @xmath100 where @xmath15 denotes ` @xmath101 ' or ` @xmath102 ' . since we are interested only in static susceptibilities , we set the bosonic frequency to zero .",
    "now we employ the bethe - salpeter equation which relates the two - particle green function and vertex parts .",

    "<S> futhermore , ising - type spin - fluctuations are important for the superconductivity , since a magnetic field along the magnetic moment destabilizes the pairing , while it is much more robust against fields perpendicular to the moment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 5@xmath65 electrons in the u ions , which play a central role in the low - temperature behavior , have a relatively itinerant nature and are strongly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> although a realistic description should involve an anderson lattice , the local interaction is of the slater - kanamori type , and hence we expect the same spin - triplet sc state . </S>",
    "<S> we thus believe that our mechanism could be realized in these uranium - based superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is another candidate compound which might exhibit a fluctuating - moment induced superconductivity . here </S>",
    "<S> , the spin - orbit coupling is nearly 100 mev @xcite , and as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : alpha_depend ] the spin anisotropy need not be very large to realize a sc state at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> also , the estimated @xmath66 @xcite and the filling @xmath67 ( same as @xmath58 due to particle - hole symmetry ) place this material in the parameter regime where the sc state is found near a fm phase ( figures  [ fig : phase](b ) and ( c ) ) . a related compound , srruo@xmath68 , with a larger @xmath12 , becomes a ferromagnet @xcite and exhibits the non - fermi liquid behavior associated with spin freezing in the high - temperature phase @xcite .    in the iron pnictides , the coulomb interactions and fillings on the fe sites </S>",
    "<S> can also be close to the spin - freezing crossover values @xcite , and for lifeas , in particular , the experimental signatures fully support this interpretation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the 3@xmath69 electrons have weak spin - orbit coupling , and hence a small spin anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for iron pnictides ( including lifeas ) , one can expect other types of pairing driven by e.g. fermi - surface nesting mechanisms to dominate .    </S>",
    "<S> for an experimental detection of the present superconductivity , it is necessary to measure both the spin and spatial parts of the pairing state . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - part can be determined by measuring the magnetic susceptibility , e.g. with nmr . </S>",
    "<S> if it is identified as spin - triplet , one still has to distinguish between @xmath2-wave pairing and the proposed @xmath3-wave inter - orbital pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the difference lies in the presence / absence of a node in the gap function which will be reflected in a power - law / exponential temperature dependence of physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides a general guiding principle in the search for new unconventional multi - band superconductors , namely the combination of emerging local moments in the spin freezing crossover regime and spin anisotropy in heavy elements .    </S>",
