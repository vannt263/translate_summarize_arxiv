    "bound states of a heavy quark @xmath2 and an antiquark @xmath3 have been the subject of extensive theoretical studies since the early days of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "relatively less attention has been paid to bound states of three heavy quarks ( @xmath4 ) , also referred to as triple heavy baryons , as a consequence of their still missing experimental evidence .",
    "nevertheless there is an ongoing theoretical activity devoted to their study mostly driven by lattice computations  @xcite , but also by phenomenological analyses ( for a review see  @xcite ) and more recently by effective field theory methods  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interest is mainly triggered by the geometry of these systems , which allows to address questions that are inaccessible with two - body systems .",
    "examples are the minimal energy configuration of three quarks in the presence of a confining potential or the origin of a three - body interaction . in this paper",
    "we will further explore the geometrical properties of the three heavy - quark system .",
    "systems of heavy quarks are conveniently studied within an effective field theory ( eft ) framework , a treatment motivated by the observation that these systems are non - relativistic and , therefore , characterized by , at least , three separated and hierarchically ordered energy scales : a hard scale of the order of the heavy - quark mass , @xmath5 , a soft scale of the order of the typical relative momenta of the heavy quarks , which are much smaller than @xmath5 , and an ultrasoft ( us ) scale of the order of the typical binding energy , which is much smaller than the relative momenta .",
    "we further assume that these scales are much larger than the typical hadronic scale @xmath6 , in this way justifying a perturbative treatment for all of them . by integrating out modes associated with the different energy scales one goes through a sequence of efts  @xcite : non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , obtained from integrating out hard modes  @xcite and potential non - relativistic qcd ( pnrqcd ) , derived from integrating out gluons with soft momenta from nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "potential nrqcd provides a formulation of the non - relativistic system in terms of potentials and us interactions ; for this reason it has proven a convenient framework for calculating us corrections .",
    "although originally designed for the study of @xmath7 bound states , i.e. quarkonia , pnrqcd has been subsequently applied also to baryons with two and three heavy quarks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the symmetry properties of three heavy - quark systems under exchange of the heavy - quark fields and their implications for the form of the pnrqcd lagrangian .",
    "we also calculate the us corrections of order @xmath1 to the singlet static energy and of order @xmath0 to the singlet static potential of a triple heavy baryon .",
    "whereas this has been achieved for the case of @xmath7 systems more than ten years ago  @xcite , the result for @xmath4 systems will be new .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : construction ] is devoted to set up pnrqcd for systems made of three static quarks .",
    "the explicit construction and color structure of the heavy - quark composite fields , pnrqcd is conventionally formulated in , is outlined in detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] , we discuss the symmetry under exchange of the heavy - quark fields and analyze its implications for the various matching coefficients , i.e. the potentials , of pnrqcd . in sec .",
    "[ sec : singlet ] , we determine the correction of order @xmath1 to the singlet static energy . restricting ourselves to an equilateral configuration of the heavy quarks , we finally solve in sec .",
    "[ sec : towardsmuinv ] the renormalization group equations for the singlet , octet and decuplet static potentials at leading logarithmic accuracy .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we shortly review the basic steps that lead to pnrqcd for systems made of three static quarks .",
    "finite mass corrections may be systematically added to the static lagrangian in the form of irrelevant operators , some of which have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic nature of the system ensures that , apart from the kinetic energy , which is of the same order as the static potential , @xmath9 corrections are small .",
    "our starting point is nrqcd in the static limit . in the quark sector",
    "the lagrangian is identical with the heavy - quark effective theory lagrangian  @xcite and reads @xmath10 the heavy - quark fields @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) , which annihilate ( create ) a heavy quark , are described by pauli spinors , whereas @xmath12 are the dirac spinors that describe light ( massless ) quarks of flavor  @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 denotes the time component of the covariant derivative , where @xmath15 is the strong gauge coupling , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the time component of the gauge field .",
    "the lagrangian is insensitive to the flavor assignment of the heavy - quark fields , a property known as heavy - quark symmetry .",
    "we have omitted the heavy - antiquark sector , as it is irrelevant to our scope .      for the purpose of studying heavy - quark bound states , it is convenient to employ an eft where the heavy - quark potentials are explicit rather than encoded in dynamical gluons , as it is the case in nrqcd .",
    "such an eft is pnrqcd , which is obtained from nrqcd by integrating out gluons whose momenta are soft .",
    "the degrees of freedom of pnrqcd are heavy - quark fields , light quarks and us gluons .",
    "as it is unnecessary to resolve the individual heavy quarks , pnrqcd is often formulated in terms of heavy - quark composite fields .",
    "the matching coefficients of pnrqcd multiplying operators bilinear in the composite fields may then be interpreted as the heavy - quark potentials in the corresponding color configurations .",
    "the derivation of pnrqcd involves identifying the heavy - quark composite fields in nrqcd , matching them to pnrqcd , and explicitly ensuring that the resulting pnrqcd field content is ultrasoft .",
    "we start with the construction of the heavy - quark composite fields .",
    "this is the point where the specific heavy - quark state that the eft is meant to describe has to be specified . in our case",
    ", this is a @xmath4 state .      to characterize the geometry of a @xmath4 state , we call @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the positions of the quarks and define the vectors @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) as follows ( cf . fig .  [ triangle ] )",
    ", @xmath23 note that the three vectors are not independent , for @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , for three quarks of equal mass or static , it is useful to define the vectors @xmath25    , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the vector @xmath26 points from the heavy quark at @xmath20 to the center of mass of the two heavy quarks at @xmath18 and @xmath19.,width=151 ]      quarks transform under the fundamental representation , @xmath27 , of the ( color ) gauge group su(3)@xmath28 .",
    "hence , a generic three ( heavy ) quark field made of fields located at the same point , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 denote color indices ) , transforms as a representation of @xmath31 .",
    "the direct product can be decomposed into a sum of irreducible representations of su(3)@xmath28 , namely @xmath32 in general , however , the three quarks are located at different spatial positions @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . under an su(3)@xmath28 gauge transformation ,",
    "each heavy - quark field @xmath33 transforms as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 $ ] , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) denote the eight generators of su(3)@xmath28 in the fundamental representation ; @xmath38 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the decomposition ( [ prodinirreps ] ) requires the fields to be linked to a common point  @xmath39 . for a multi - quark system",
    "a natural choice is the system s center of mass .",
    "a way to link the quark fields to another point is through an equal - time straight wilson string , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the color gauge field , and @xmath42 denotes path ordering of the color matrices . due to its transformation property under su(3)@xmath28 gauge transformations , @xmath43 @xmath44 , the wilson string acts as a gauge transporter , and @xmath45 @xmath46 indeed transforms like a quark field located at @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the following three - quark field , @xmath47 transforms as a @xmath31 representation of the su(3)@xmath28 gauge group , and , following eq .",

    "( [ phiijk ] ) we may express the three - quark field @xmath85 in terms of the composite singlet , octet and decuplet fields .",
    "the next step will consist in matching these composite fields to the corresponding ones in pnrqcd .",

    "one can match nrqcd to pnrqcd by equating the expectation value of the nrqcd hamiltonian in the state @xmath90 with the pnrqcd hamiltonian ( see @xcite for the matching in the @xmath91 case ) .",

    "the gluons in pnrqcd are explicitly rendered us by multipole expanding the gluon fields in the relative coordinates @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) with respect to the center of mass coordinate @xmath39 .",
    "the reason is that the center of mass coordinate ( the `` location '' of the three heavy - quark system ) scales like the inverse of the recoiling total momentum of the three quarks , which is of the order of the us energy scale , while the relative coordinates of the three quarks ( describing the `` extension '' of the triple heavy baryon ) scale like the inverse of the typical relative momenta of the heavy quarks , which are of the order of the soft scale . as a result , ultrasoft gluons in pnrqcd are invariant under us gauge transformations , i.e. gauge transformations localized in @xmath39 .",
    "a legendre transform of the pnrqcd hamiltonian finally provides us with the pnrqcd lagrangian .    in the same way as nrqcd can be understood as an expansion of qcd in terms of the inverse of the heavy - quark masses , pnrqcd can be understood as an expansion of the gluon fields of nrqcd , projected onto the specific ( two or three ) heavy - quark fock space , in powers of the relative coordinates of the heavy quarks .",
