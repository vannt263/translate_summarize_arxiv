    "( [ bur1 ] ) and ( [ kpz ] ) , respectively . as discussed in paper ii these distributions are basically given by the martin - siggia - rose path integral weighted by the effective action for the appropriate paths .",
    "in the weak noise limit only the paths governed by the saddle point equations contribute to the distributions and , as will be discussed here , we can actually circumvent the path integral formulation entirely by a more direct approach based on the fokker - planck equation . in the weak noise limit",
    "this equation takes the form of a hamilton - jacobi equation implying a symplectic structure and immediately lending itself to a canonical phase space formulation .",
    "we are thus able in a very direct manner to map the stochastic processes described by the kpz - burgers equations to a conserved dynamical system with orbits satisfying deterministic canonical hamilton equations , identical to the saddle point equations in the path integral approach .",
    "the stochastic nature of the langevin equations is reflected in the peculiar topology of the energy surfaces .",
    "it turns out that the stationary probability distribution is determined by an infinite - time orbit on the zero - energy manifold whereas the time - dependent distribution , approaching the stationary one at long times , corresponds to a finite - time orbit .",

    "\\(i ) in the generic case of a general nonlinear langevin equation for a set of stochastic variables driven by white noise , the weak noise limit of the associated fokker - planck equation takes the form of a hamilton - jacobi equation , which in turn implies a symplectic structure with a _ principle of least action _ , an action , an associated hamiltonian , and hamilton equations of motion .",
    "this formulation is equivalent to the saddle point discussion in the martin - siggia - rose approach in paper ii .",
    "\\(ii ) the ensuing canonical phase space formulation allows for a discussion of the time - dependent probability distributions , i.e. , the weak noise solutions of the fokker - planck equation , in terms of phase space orbits on conserved energy surfaces , governed by hamilton equations of motion .",
    "the action associated with an orbit plays the role of a weight function in much the same way as the hamiltonian entering the boltzmann factor in the description of thermodynamic equilibrium . in the kinetic nonequilibrium problem defined by the langevin equation",
    "the dynamic action yields the probability distributions .",
    "\\(iii ) in the canonical phase space formulation the underlying stochastic nature of the langevin equation and the relaxational character of the solutions of the fokker - planck equation are reflected in the topological structure of the energy surfaces . a structure which differs markedly from the energy surface topology for ordinary dynamical problems in particular , the zero - energy manifold which determines the stationary state , i.e. , the stationary probability distribution , has a two - fold submanifold structure , including a hyperbolic stationary point , which in the simple case of a single stochastic variable corresponds to the unstable maximum of an _ inverted _ potential .",
    "moreover , the _ waiting time _ for the orbits passing close to the stationary point accounts for the markovian behavior of the probability distributions .",
    "finally , the long - time orbit close to the zero - energy manifold determines via the action the time - dependent probability distribution .",
    "\\(iv ) in the case of a few degrees of freedom the canonical phase space approach yields the established results following from an analysis of the fokker - planck equations . on the other hand , in the case of many degrees of freedom , i.e. , the field theoretical case , the fokker - planck equation becomes an unwieldy multi- dimensional differential - integro equation , and the canonical phase space approach , replacing the fokker - planck equation ( in the weak noise limit ) with coupled canonical field equations yields , in addition to providing an alternative point of view of the stochastic processes in terms of dynamical system theory , a methodological advantage ; particularly in the case where we can determine the zero - energy manifold explicitly .",
    "\\(v ) in the field theoretical cases of the noisy burgers or kpz equations in one dimension , we can for special reasons identify the zero - energy manifold and determine : ( 1 ) the stationary distribution , ( 2 ) the long - time diffusive mode contribution to the time - dependent skew distribution and ( 3 ) a heuristic expression for the short - time ( transient ) soliton mode contribution . in the interesting case of higher dimensions we are only able to make some general statements .",
