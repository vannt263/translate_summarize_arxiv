    "pairing effects in metallic nanoparticles have been investigated extensively since the experimental work by black , ralph , and tinkham @xcite in the mid 90 s .",
    "intensive theoretical studies of pairing interactions in nanometric particles followed the experimental work .",
    "@xcite these studies focused mainly on the influence of size quantization of the electronic levels on the paired state .",
    "the systems considered were relatively large ( radius larger than 3 nm ) containing more than @xmath0 valence electrons , and having irregular shapes , such that the only symmetry of the problem is time reversal symmetry .",
    "smaller irregular grains are expected to be unpaired , since their average energy - level spacing exceeds the bulk pairing gap , breaking the anderson criterion .",
    "@xcite    more recently , kresin and ovchinnikov @xcite investigated the possibility of pairing in smaller metallic atomic clusters containing tens of atoms .",
    "such clusters are known to exhibit a shell structure in their electronic spectrum .",
    "@xcite this energy structure arises from the approximate spherical symmetry of the effective potential felt by the valence electrons in the nanoparticle .",
    "the near degeneracy of these shells may be considered as a narrow peak in the electronic density of states ( dos ) which enhances both the energy gap and the critical temperature compared to the bulk material .",
    "kresin and ovchinnikov predicted a large enhancement in both parameters ( @xmath1 between 100k to 200k and an energy gap of tens of mev ) for specific examples of individual aluminum and gallium clusters containing a few tens of atoms .",
    "similar results were qualitatively predicted by friedel in 1992 .",
    "@xcite the effect of shell structure in larger spherical nanoparticles , together with modifications in the effective interaction due to alteration of the electrons wave functions , as well as a nonuniform gap parameter , were considered in a recent study .",
    "@xcite a large and strongly size dependent energy gap and critical temperature were predicted for these particles .",
    "the effect of shell structure on pairing was also discussed in the context of fermionic atoms in harmonic atomic traps .",
    "@xcite    a high dos at the highest occupied shell ( hos ) of the atomic cluster ( or nanoparticle ) is maintained as long as the particle retains spherical symmetry .",
    "however , clusters ( and nanoparticles ) with a non - full hos undergo a jahn - teller deformation @xcite , which lifts the degeneracy of the hos and reduces the high dos . therefore , kresin and ovchinnikov @xcite considered clusters in which the deformation is minimal ( _ i.e. _  either clusters with completely full electronic shells , or with an almost full outer shell ) and in which the energy difference between the hos and the lowest unoccupied shell ( lus ) is small , as the most favorable scenario for the observation of pairing correlations .    the energy gap and the critical temperature measured in `` large '' irregularly shaped nanoparticles of various superconductor metals are larger than the corresponding values of the bulk material .",
    "evidence for this increase is found in measurements preformed with single aluminum particles .",
    "@xcite additional support for this behavior comes from past work done with several types of superconducting thin films .",
    "@xcite these films were composed of superconducting grains embedded on top of an oxidized substrate , and separated by the dielectric barriers formed by the oxidized substrate .",
    "evidence for a pairing energy gap was found in tin grains as small as 2.5 nm .  @xcite    the increase in both energy gap and critical temperature was usually attributed to a larger effective phonon - mediated electron - electron interaction , due to `` soft '' surface phonons of the individual particles .",
    "@xcite there are also some indications for enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling in some molecular devices .",
    "@xcite however , kresin and ovchinnikov @xcite as well as friedel @xcite assumed a constant phonon - mediated pairing interaction , which was taken to be equal to the corresponding values in the bulk material .",
    "the increase in the energy gap in larger irregularly shaped nanoparticles was also explained as being due to finite size modifications in the bulk electronic dos @xcite , and to modifications in the bulk electronic wave functions which induce alteration in the effective interaction between the electrons .",
    "@xcite however , possible changes in the underlying electron - phonon interaction , which may be important in smaller nanoparticles , were ignored in these works .",
    "furthermore , a semi - classical approximation , together with an assumption of a small ratio between the mean level spacing and the bulk gap , were used in these works . in the present work ,",
    "we consider much smaller nanoparticles ( containing only hundreds of atoms ) for which the semi - classical approximation may not be appropriate , and the mean level spacing even within the hos is larger than the bulk energy gap .",
    "therefore , in what follows we propose a somewhat different approach which , although limited to simple geometries , is more appropriate for the description of pairing in nanoparticles with few hundreds of atoms .    in this work we present a calculation of the energy gap in nanoparticles at zero temperature , taking into account the finite size effects on both electrons and phonons .",
    "the nanoparticles are assumed to be isolated both electrically and mechanically from the outer environment .",
    "we treat spherical or nearly spherical particles . for this type of particles",
    "we explicitly evaluate the electron - phonon interaction , the resulting pairing interaction , and the coulomb interaction .",
    "thus , we are able to predict deviations from the results obtained using the average bulk values of these interactions .",
    "non - zero temperature and the transition between the paired and the unpaired state as temperature is varied are not addressed in this paper .",
    "we note that the transition is expected to be a `` smeared '' unlike the one found in an infinite system .",
    "furthermore , the usual bcs ratio between the energy gap and critical temperature should not be used in order to calculate the characteristic temperature of the transition .",
    "three types of materials are considered as examples  aluminum , zinc , and potassium .",
    "aluminum is a typical low - temperature , weak - coupling superconductor with the second highest critical temperature ( in the bulk ) of the five superconducting metals ",
    "al , ga , in , zn , and cd , that exhibit electronic shell structure in their atomic clusters and ultra - small nanoparticles .  @xcite furthermore , aluminum nanoparticles ( albeit larger than the ones we are considering ) are used in experiments examining the properties of superconducting nanoparticles .",
    "although potassium is a non - superconducting metal in the bulk its atomic clusters and nanoparticles exhibit a pronounced electronic shell structure .",
    "@xcite therefore , the effect of the shell structure , together with modifications in the phonon - mediated electron - electron interaction , may enable the formation of a paired electronic ground - state .",
    "finally , we expect zinc particles to be less susceptible to janh - teller deformations than the other four superconducting metals mentioned above , due to the larger shear modulus of zinc .",
    "pairing was proposed as a mechanism that may explain the apparent odd - even staggering in the ionization potential spectra ( meaning that the ionization potential of a cluster with an even number of atoms is larger than that of the neighboring odd clusters ) and in the abundance spectra of alkali clusters containing up to a few tens of atoms .",
    "@xcite pairing interaction was also proposed as an explanation for some of the discrepancies between the calculated ionization spectrum ( obtained by using independent particle models ) , and the measured spectra of sodium clusters containing tens of atoms .",
    "@xcite however , it was found that , at least when considering these extremely small metal clusters ( with up to about 100 atoms ) , the strong fluctuations in the ionization potential could be explained by the deformation of open shell clusters @xcite and by the effect of spin degeneracy in the deformed clusters @xcite ( where the only remaining degeneracy is the double degeneracy due to the spin ) without resorting to the effects of pairing interaction .",
    "therefore , we avoid the regime of very small atomic clusters and concentrate on nanoparticles containing hundreds of atoms .",
    "the general scheme of our calculation is as follows :    1 .   using a simple and crude model , the single - electron and single - phonon states and spectra",
    "are evaluated .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is calculated assuming a static thomas - fermi screened interaction .",
    "the phonon - mediated pairing interaction is evaluated using either the frhlich transformation or the similarity renormalization .",
    "4 .   the splitting of the electronic degenerate levels caused by deviations from spherical symmetry of the particles is estimated .",
    "5 .   as a reference",
    ", the modification of the electronic spectrum due to the pairing interaction is calculated in spherical particles .",
    "the reduction in the effects of pairing on the low energy excitations of the electronic spectrum due to small deformations is evaluated .",
    "finally , the reduction of the pairing interaction due to coulomb repulsion is also taken into account .",
    "we note that the effective interaction is initially calculated by applying the frhlich transformation @xcite to the system s hamiltonian .",
    "this method is easy to apply and it describes correctly some of the features of the pairing interaction .",
    "however , it produces unrealistic results when applied to a system with non - degenerate electrons .",
    "it therefore can be used only for the spherical particles . in order to account for the effect of deformations , we use the similarity renormalization method .",
    "@xcite this method is known to give accurate results for the transition temperature and the energy gap in strong coupling bulk material superconductors within the framework of a hamiltonian theory .",
    "@xcite    the pairing hamiltonian of the deformed particles involves varying coupling coefficients and non - uniform energy level distribution .",
    "we are unaware of an exact solution to such a hamiltonian . therefore",
    ", we use the simple bcs grand - canonical approximation to investigate this hamiltonian , although , in principal , a canonical ensemble approach , such as fixed - n projection of the bcs state @xcite , is more appropriate .",
    "several authors @xcite have pointed out that finite level spacing should modify the bcs solution , leading to a smaller lowest pairing excitation energy compared to the one obtained by the bcs approximation .",
    "this reduction is found to be approximately equal to the level spacing of the single - electron spectrum as long as the relevant level spacing ( the level spacing within the hos in our model ) is smaller than the lowest pairing excitation energy . in our model we find that the lowest excitation energy is several times larger than the hos level spacing , and therefore this finite - level - spacing correction can be neglected as long as one is merely interested in a rough estimate of the modifications to the lowest excitation energy .",
    "therefore , for our purposes the simplicity of the bcs approximation makes it an adequate choice for calculating the excitation energy ( see some additional comments on this subject in section [ subsec : the bcs model ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a more accurate description of the pairing correlations should involve a canonical ensemble treatment .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "the electrons , the phonons , and the interaction between them ] we describe the single particle states of both electrons and phonons in spherical particles , as well as the interaction between them .",
    "the derivation of the effective electron - electron interaction and the resulting approximate model pairing hamiltonian is given in section [ sec : the effective electron - electron interaction ] .",
    "the deformation of the spherical particles is estimated in section [ sec : small deformation of the spherical particles ] , while the effect of coulomb repulsion is discussed in section [ sec : the effect of the coulomb interaction ] .",
    "the modification of the free electrons spectrum is addressed in section [ sec : modification of the electrons spectrum ] .",
    "numerical results concerning both the degenerate and the non - degenerate scenarios are presented in section [ sec : results ] . some measurable quantities , which may be used to identify pairing in such small nanoparticles , are briefly discussed in section [ sec : additional possible measurable quantities ] .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the delocalized electrons of a nanoparticle are modeled as free particles within an infinite spherical potential well .",
    "alternatively , one may use a spherically symmetric harmonic potential .",
    "the former effective potential corresponds to complete screening of the electrostatic potential of the particle s positive ionic background , while the latter reflects a complete lack of screening . as we comment later",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the screening picture of the bulk material essentially persists even in nanoparticles that contain hundreds of atoms .",
    "thus , we may expect that the electrostatic interaction is almost completely screened .",
    "furthermore , the major features of the shell structure observed in the abundance and ionization spectra of atomic clusters , reflect the filling of major energy shells that are characterized by an angular quantum number @xmath2 and a radial quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite this fits well with the spherical box approximation , although a deformed 3d oscillator gives an even better fit .",
    "@xcite the realistic effective potential lies somewhere between these two extremes , and includes deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "@xcite note , however , that the 3d harmonic potential introduces an artificially high degeneracy of the energy levels , which would lead to an enhancement of the pairing effects we are exploring .",
    "this additional degeneracy is lifted even by a small amount of screening .",
    "thus , the infinite well approximation captures better the physics of the true potential .",
    "the energy levels of electrons in a spherical box are given by @xmath4 and their corresponding wave functions are @xmath5 where @xmath2 and @xmath6 are the usual angular momentum quantum numbers , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "also , @xmath9 are the spherical bessel functions , @xmath10 is the @xmath3th zero of the function @xmath9 divided by the radius @xmath11 of the sphere , @xmath12 is the effective mass of the electrons , and @xmath13 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "we assume that the effective mass of the electrons remains the same as in the bulk metal .",
    "@xcite the normalization constant @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 we note that , including spin degeneracy , each energy level may contain up to @xmath16 electrons .",
    "the electron field operator is given by @xmath17 and the second quantized hamiltonian takes the usual form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spin index .",
    "acoustic phonons are described as elastic disturbances in the positive ionic background of the nanoparticles , which we model by using linear elasticity theory . since the typical nanoparticles we are dealing with contain few hundreds of atoms , the use of an elastic description could be questioned . however , the applicability of elasticity theory for nanoparticles is supported by a reasonable description of the low frequency acoustic modes for nanometer size particles .",
    "@xcite also , phonon related phenomena in nanomechanical systems are often modeled by using an elastic model for the description of the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite therefore , although in principle one may solve the discrete equations of motion for the few hundred atoms , we prefer the simple elastic model that enables an analytic expression for the effective interaction between the electrons .",
    "the small size of particles under consideration leads inevitably to effective elastic constants that deviate from the bulk material values .",
    "generally , nanometer size systems tend to exhibit smaller elastic coefficients compared to the bulk .",
    "however , ab - inito density functional theory calculations of the effective modulus of dilation of small silicon , tin , and lead atomic clusters and the effective young modulus of ultra - thin si nanowires @xcite , indicate that the softening of the elastic constants is quite restricted . for example , the calculated reduction of the effective modulus is about a factor of two for silicon clusters containing as few as 15 atoms , and about 25% for tin and lead particles with the same number of atoms .",
    "the calculated variation in the young modulus of silicon wires is even smaller .",
    "we also note that experimental studies have found that the young modulus of gold nanorods ( with diameters varying between 10nm-20 nm ) is either lowered by 20%-30% @xcite or remains essentially unchanged @xcite compared to the bulk material .",
    "we therefore use both the lam constants of the bulk material , as well as 25% smaller lam constants for comparison .",
    "we solve the linear elasticity equation of motion under stress - free boundary conditions imposed on the surface of the sphere .",
    "the relevant results of the elastic solution are given in appendix [ app : the longitudinal phonon sub - system ] based on the treatment by eringen .",
    "@xcite the normal modes of vibration can be divided into two types : spheroidal modes containing both longitudinal and transverse components , which are coupled through the boundary conditions , and torsional modes consisting solely of transverse components .",
    "similar to the electronic wave functions and energy levels , the vibrational modes are characterized by two angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath6 , and by a radial quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "as will be explained in the following section , we are interested only in the longitudinal component of the spheroidal modes .",
    "this component can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the solution of the scalar helmholtz equation @xmath22 which for stress - free boundary conditions takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the bulk longitudinal sound velocity of the material ) .",
    "the boundary conditions impose a discrete spectrum , where the eigenfrequencies are characterized by the angular quantum number @xmath2 and by the radial quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the ratio between the amplitude @xmath26 of the longitudinal component and the amplitude @xmath27 of the transverse component are uniquely determined by the boundary conditions @xcite ( see appendix [ app : the longitudinal phonon sub - system ] ) .",
    "we note that a continuum approach results in an infinite number of normal modes . in order to account for the atomistic discreteness of the nanoparticles ,",
    "we take into account only the lowest @xmath28 modes of the entire spectrum , where @xmath29 is the number of atoms in the nanoparticle .",
    "we define the debye energy of a nanoparticle as the energy of the most energetic phonon mode .    in order to quantize the vibrational modes we write the spheroidal displacement field as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the material density of the cluster and @xmath32 @xmath33 are the phonon creation ( annihilation ) operators .",
    "the second quantized hamiltonian is obtained by inserting the quantized displacement field into the linear elastic hamiltonian , thus obtaining @xmath34 the amplitude of the longitudinal component @xmath26 is uniquely determined by the normalization condition imposed by the quantization procedure @xmath35 and by the ratio @xmath36 .",
    "we assume a screened interaction between the electrons and the density disturbance in the ionic background , _",
    "i.e. _  the phonons .",
    "this interaction is added to the free hamiltonian composed of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we take into account only the static electronic screening when considering the interaction between the electrons and the phonons .",
    "@xcite this approximation is reasonable since the maximal frequency of the phonons is two orders of magnitude smaller than the fermi energy of the electrons . in order to keep the calculation as simple as possible we assume static electronic screening also when considering the direct coulomb interaction between the electrons ( see section [ sec : the effect of the coulomb interaction ] ) .",
    "we apply a unitary transformation to the basic hamiltonian ( @xmath39 ) in order to account for the contribution of the phonons ( or the phonon screening ) to the effective interaction between the electrons , as in the original work of frhlich .",
    "@xcite    we utilize the thomas - fermi approximation in order to describe the static screening .",
    "this approximation should still be reasonably valid for particles containing hundreds of atoms , since the typical bulk thomas - fermi screening length is an order of magnitude smaller than the diameter of such particles .",
    "therefore , the screened electrostatic interaction hamiltonian between the electrons and the phonons takes the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 is the electronic local density , @xmath43 is the local variation in the ionic background charge density due to the presence of the phonons , @xmath44 is the thomas - fermi wave number , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the modified spherical bessel functions , @xmath47 and @xmath48 when @xmath49 , and vice versa .",
    "considering small deformations , the relative change in an infinitesimal volume element is given ( to first order in the displacement field ) by @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite therefore , to first order in @xmath51 , the effect of the transverse component of the spheroidal phonons on @xmath43 vanishes .",
    "thus , we can take into account only the longitudinal component of the spheroidal modes when considering the interaction with the electrons .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is therefore given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of valence electrons per atom , and @xmath54 is the atomic density of the cluster , which is taken to be equal to its bulk value . using eqs .",
    " ,  , and we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , and where the angular momentum quantum numbers satisfy @xmath59 the coupling coefficient @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 \\label{eq : rln}\\\\ \\theta_{l}&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(2l_{1}+1\\right)\\left(2l_{2}+1\\right)}{4\\pi\\left(2l_{3}+1\\right ) } } c\\left(l_{1},l_{2},l_{3};0,0,0\\right),\\label{eq : thetalm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are clebch - gordan coefficients ( adopting the notation of rose @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed derivation of @xmath60 is given in appendix [ app : the detailed derivation ] .",
    "we can summarize the total hamiltonian as @xmath64",
    "we apply the unitary frhlich transformation @xcite to the hamiltonian , @xmath65+\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(h_{e - p}+\\left[h_{0},s\\right]\\right),s\\right ] + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[h_{e - p},s\\right]+o\\left(m_{lmn}^{3}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is an anti - hermitian operator defined by @xmath67 the coefficients @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 and are chosen so as to eliminate the electron - phonon interaction up to second order in @xmath60 .",
    "specifically , the particular choice of @xmath70 ensures that @xmath71=0 $ ] , and thus the lowest non - vanishing term in the transformed hamiltonian is @xmath72.$ ]    the interaction term contains a sum of operator products , most of which still involve the phonon operators .",
    "however , it also contains a purely electronic term , which represents the effective electron - electron interaction resulting from the original electron - phonon interaction ( up to second order in @xmath60 ) . calculating explicitly this interaction term we obtain the following effective electron - electron interaction @xmath73 where the primed indexes stem from the operator @xmath66 .",
    "the summation over @xmath74 is restricted only by the finite number of modes in each branch of the phonon spectrum ( defined by the a specific value of @xmath75 ) , due to the finite number of normal modes supported by the nanoparticle .",
    "we note that the numerator in ( [ eq : the general electron - electron interaction ] ) is not always positive , unlike the numerator appearing in the similar result obtained for translationally invariant system .",
    "@xcite    following cooper s argument @xcite , the electrons in the paired state are paired in a manner that `` uses '' the attractive part of @xmath76 in the `` most efficient way '' .",
    "first , we note that the difference between adjacent electronic energy levels is typically larger than the maximal typical phonon energy by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "therefore , we can expect to obtain a maximal attractive interaction between electrons belonging to the same energy level .",
    "thus , we neglect inter - level phonon - mediated interaction .",
    "next , we assume , as in the ordinary bcs theory , that the electrons are paired in a singlet state implying @xmath77 . finally , due to the properties of the clebch - gordan coefficients appearing in , we find that , in order to ensure the negativity of the intra - level interaction , we must assume that the cooper pairs are composed of electrons with opposite @xmath78 component of angular momentum .",
    "this restriction means that @xmath79 eqs .  -",
    "ensure that the numerator appearing in is always positive for time - reversed pairs of electrons of the form @xmath80 .",
    "since inter - level interaction is ignored , all fully occupied levels , or levels with one electron or one hole , are considered to be inert and the phonon - mediated interaction acts only within the hos .",
    "this approximation holds as long as the temperature of the nanoparticle is much smaller than the level spacing around the fermi level .",
    "since this level spacing is typically of the order of 0.1ev for the particles we are considering , the approximation is reasonable up to a temperature of a few hundred kelvins .",
    "therefore , we are left with the effective hamiltonian @xmath81^{2}(-1)^{m - m^{'}}c^{\\dag}_{lm^{'}n\\sigma}c^{\\dag}_{l - m^{'}n-\\sigma}c_{l - mn-\\sigma}c_{lmn\\sigma},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 characterize the highest occupied electronic level .",
    "the structure of the effective hamiltonian in may have been anticipated in advance , since the coupling between time - reversed pairs is a common characteristic of the pairing phenomenon .  @xcite our numerical calculations for the three materials under consideration , show that the coefficients @xmath68 in are always much smaller than 1 , when one considers the interaction within a degenerate hos . therefore , neglecting higher - order terms in is justified .      in this section",
    "we introduce an alternative derivation of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the above calculations work well for exactly degenerated hos .",
    "however , in the next section we want to study the effects of the splitting of the initially degenerate electron energy levels due to static deformations of the spherical particles .",
    "we expect the splitting to reduce the effective electron - electron interaction compared to the spherical system .",
    "the effects of splitting can not be accounted for correctly in the framework of the frhlich transformation .",
    "using and introducing the energy splitting due to deformations , one obtains an artificial enhancement ( and even divergence ) of the effective interaction , when the energy splitting @xmath82 is of order @xmath83 . note that even if no actual divergences are encountered , the second order expansion is invalid if the denominators in are smaller than the values of @xmath60 .",
    "another deficiency of the frhlich interaction lies in the fact that it includes terms that represent coupling of electronic states by a virtual phonon whose energy is smaller than the energy separating the electronic states . in the usual bcs treatment these ( repulsive ) terms",
    "are avoided , since the interaction is assumed to be constant in @xmath84-space , with an artificial cutoff at the debye energy of the material .",
    "lastly , using a frhlich type interaction within the bcs formalism results in a large overestimate of the size of the energy gap and critical temperature of bulk superconductors .  @xcite    an alternative derivation of the effective interaction relies on the application of the similarity renormalization method to the initial hamiltonian .",
    "although its application is more complex , it avoids the appearance of vanishing energy denominators .",
    "furthermore , the resulting interaction is reduced between electrons with different energies , and it is automatically cut - off at the right energy scale . also , the obtained effective interaction is always attractive . as shown by mielke @xcite this approach yields the correct critical temperature and energy gap for strong - coupling bulk superconductors within the framework of the bcs model .",
    "the derivation of the effective interaction is given in appendix [ app : detailed ] , where we follow the treatment by mielke .",
    "@xcite we obtain the following effective electron - electron interaction between electrons belonging to the same energy shell @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the heaviside function and @xmath87 are the single - electron energies in the hos of the spherical or deformed nanoparticles .",
    "the heaviside function in ensures that a phonon can mediate interaction between two electron states only if its energy is larger than the energy separation between the two states .",
    "we note that and coincide if the deformations are neglected .",
    "corrections to the wave functions of both electrons and phonons due to deviation from spherical symmetry are neglected in .",
    "this is justified because it affects the numerator in only to second order in the perturbation .",
    "the effect of deformation on the phonon spectrum is minor , as deformations are small compared to particles radii ( see section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our result differs from mielke s interaction in the cutoff function appearing in @xmath88 .",
    "the source of the difference between our cutoff function and mielke s cutoff function is explained in appendix [ app : detailed ] .",
    "however , our interaction and mielke s coincide for the physical scenario considered by mielke .",
    "this scenario consists of an effective interaction mediated by non - dispersive einstein phonons , whose frequency is much larger than the electron energies .",
    "our result is similar to the one obtained by hbsch and becker @xcite using a different perturbative renormalization scheme .",
    "finally , we note that the electron energies are renormalized by the electron - phonon interaction , and that the effective interaction should depend on the renormalized electron energies .",
    "@xcite the renormalization is especially important in describing properties of strong - coupling bulk superconductors .",
    "@xcite this is another deficiency of the frhlich interaction , which depends on the non - renormalized energies .",
    "by contrast , the energies appearing in eq .",
    "are in fact the renormalized energies . however , renormalization of the single - electron energies is not important in our model since the electron - phonon interaction can not lift the degeneracy of the electron shells in the spherical particles .",
    "the contribution of renormalization to the splitting of the hos in the deformed particles is small , since it is of the order of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 parameterizes the deviation from spherical symmetry [ the definition of @xmath91 is given in eq .   in the following section ] .",
    "therefore , we neglect the effect of renormalization on the electron energies and instead use the non - renormalized electron energies . in appendix",
    "[ app : detailed ] we show that the renormalization of the phonon energies due to the electron - phonon interaction can also be neglected .",
    "the energy shift due to renormalization does depend on the shell quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the electron filling .",
    "therefore , in a more detailed treatment that takes into account inter - shell effects ( like the one carried out by kresin and ovchinnikov @xcite ) renormalization effects should be considered , especially when dealing with nearly degenerate hos and lus . in appendix",
    "[ app : detailed ] we give the expression for renormalization of electron energies due to electron - phonon interaction within the hos , which is responsible for most of the hos shift .",
    "the expressions for the renormalization of electron energies and phonon energies are similar to the ones obtained for the bulk system by mielke .",
    "deviation from spherical shape leads to a splitting of the degenerate electron levels and to a decrease in the total energy in the free electrons of the nanoparticle .",
    "on the other hand , deviation from a spherically symmetric shape leads to an increase in the elastic energy of the nanoparticles .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation is determined by the balance between the increase in the elastic energy and the decrease in the electronic energy .",
    "a similar type of calculation was used by kresin and ovchinnikov @xcite in order to estimate shape oscillations of aluminum atomic cluster ( with 14 atoms ) , in which an electron from the full hos is raised to the lus .",
    "the general expression for the elastic energy density is @xcite @xmath92 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 are the lam coefficients , and @xmath94 is the displacement field . for simplicity , we assume that the local density in the nanoparticles remains the same as in the bulk material regardless of the shape of the particles . therefore , we need to consider a distortion of the spherical shape for which @xmath95 choosing such a displacement field eliminates the first term in .",
    "we also assume an axially symmetric distortion of the surface of the spherical particles .",
    "this distortion can be parameterized as follows @xmath96,\\label{eq : rtor}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 are the legendre polynomials .",

    "is varied .",

    "@xcite measured the heat capacity of aluminum atomic clusters containing between 43 and 48 atoms .",
    "they found a peak in the heat capacity of clusters containing 44 and 47 atoms around @xmath193 .",
    "these peaks are claimed to represent the transition between the paired and the unpaired state as the temperature of the clusters is varied .",
    "the experimental results are somewhat higher , but are still in accordance with the calculations of kresin and ovchinnikov .",
    "@xcite we note that when evaluating the energy gap of the nanoparticles at such a temperature , it may be necessary to take into account finite temperature broadening of the sharp , almost degenerate , single - electron levels .",
    "we investigated the possibility of pairing interaction in metallic nanoparticles containing a few hundreds of atoms at zero - temperature .",
    "three materials were considered  aluminum , zinc and potassium .",
    "we started from a simple model of non - interacting phonons ( quantized normal modes of vibration of a stress - free elastic sphere ) and electrons ( fermions in a spherical potential box ) in the nanoparticles .",
    "we introduced an electrostatic screened thomas - fermi interaction potential between the electrons and the phonons , using the thomas - fermi screening length in bulk materials .",
    "we then derived an effective phonon - mediated electron - electron interaction , resulting from the underlying electron - phonon interaction .",
    "we found that the strongest attractive interaction was between time - reversed electron pairs within the same energy shell .",
    "we neglected the rest of the effective interaction and assumed a model pairing hamiltonian consisting only of the interaction between electrons in the hos .",
    "the effective interaction was derived by means of either the frhlich transformation @xcite or the similarity renormalization .",
    "@xcite the application of the frhlich transformation was more straightforward but restricted to particles with degenerate hos .",
    "however , the degeneracy of the hos is lifted due to deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "the effects of deformations on the effective interaction between the electrons were taken into account within the framework of the similarity renormalization method .",
    "our application of this technique followed the work of mielke .",
    "@xcite however , the interaction we obtained includes a different cutoff function than the one obtained by mielke .",
    "@xcite our cutoff function , which resembles more the result obtained by hubsch and becker @xcite , reflects the fact that a phonon can not mediate the interaction between electron states with an energy separation larger than its own energy .",
    "we also included a screened coulomb interaction in our model hamiltonian , and found that it plays a significant role in reducing pairing effects .",
    "unlike the frhlich interaction , the effective interaction obtained by the application of the similarity transformation depends on the renormalized electron energies due to the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the size of the renormalization was also obtained using the similarity renormalization method . however , within the framework our model , in which inter - shell interactions are neglected , the renormalization is unimportant since ( for spherical particles ) it shifts all of the states within the hos by the same amount . however",
    ", renormalization may play a more important role when inter - shell interactions are taken into account , especially when the non - renormalized hos and lus are nearly degenerate .    on average , there was no large difference between the average phonon - mediated interaction we obtained and the extrapolation from bulk interaction . however , finite size effects induced variation in the values of the average interaction in contrast to the smooth monotonic behavior of the extrapolation .",
    "finite size effects also caused a large scatter between the detailed effective interaction matrix elements for a given particle .",
    "this scatter was further enhanced in deformed nanoparticles , and it was important to take it into account when we evaluated the energy gap in those particles .",
    "we also found that the entrance of an additional single phonon to the effective interaction between the electrons resulted in small jumps in the average effective interaction , and in more pronounced jumps in the energy gap of spherical particles .",
    "however , it was hard to observe the fingerprints of this effect in the calculated energy gap of deformed nanoparticles .",
    "the effect of the pairing hamiltonian on the electronic spectrum was evaluated by using the seniority model ( when we considered particles with degenerate hos ) or by solving the bcs gap equation for the hos .",
    "when coulomb interaction and deformations were ignored , we found that aluminum particles exhibit an average energy gap ( _ i.e. _  the lowest excitation energy of the paired electrons ) of about 0.14ev , while the average gap in zinc and potassium particles was found to be 0.07ev and 0.02ev respectively .",
    "the addition of coulomb interaction , together with deformations , reduced the energy gap by a factor of 5.5 on average in the aluminum particles and by a factor of 10 in the zinc particles . on the other hand , the same effects reduced the energy gap to zero in the potassium particles . despite the large reduction ,",
    "our calculations indicate that a large portion of both aluminum and zinc particles should exhibit pair correlations and modifications in their electronic spectrum .",
    "we found that within the framework of our approximate model , the resulting energy gap is on average intermediate between the lseee and the energy difference between the hos and the lus .",
    "additionally , if pairing is present , then we expect that the magnetization of nanoparticles with certain fillings of the hos ( namely , two electrons at the highest sub - shell within the hos ) to be different from the magnetization of the unpaired ground - state . therefore , magnetization may serve as an additional fingerprint of the existence of pairing correlations in metallic nanoparticles .",
    "our results indicate that the size ( and maybe even the existence ) of the modifications in the electronic energy spectrum are sensitive to several factors such as the effective elastic constants of the particles , the details of the energy splitting of the hos ( which may be affected by additional mechanisms such as disorder , non - axially symmetric deformations , and surface roughness ) , and maybe the detailed description of the coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , it is probably necessary to consider these aspects more accurately in order to reliably predict whether pairing correlations do exist in specific metallic nanoparticles .",
    "an additional improvement involves applying a canonical - ensemble treatment of the pairing hamiltonian instead of the grand - canonical bcs approximation .",
    "the simplest fixed - n treatment for the energy gap @xcite is obtained by projecting the bcs ground state , as well as the bcs ground state with two `` blocked '' single electron states , onto the subspace of states with a fixed number of electrons in the hos and calculating the energy difference between them .",
    "this method yields results that are quite close to the ones obtained by an exact solution of the pairing hamiltonian for aluminum particles with constant interaction strength@xcite and uniform or random level structure .",
    "therefore , it is probably sufficient in order to evaluate the accuracy of the bcs approximation results for our case , where an exact approach is inapplicable .",
    "more sophisticated methods could also be used , but their application should be considered in light of the approximations involved in deriving the effective interaction between the electrons and in estimating the single - electron level structure .    finally , we note that the standard approach for calculating properties of superconducting bulk material relies either on the application of eliashberg theory @xcite or density functional theory @xcite instead of a bcs approach based on an effective model hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , density functional theory was already used to describe pairing in the nucleus @xcite and in nanometric superconductors .",
    "@xcite specifically , the application of density functional approach to equally spaced @xcite or randomly distributed @xcite electronic spectrum ( both with constant pairing interaction ) reproduced remarkably well the results of the exact richardson solution .",
    "it would be interesting to see how our simple bcs approach would fair compared to a density functional approach applied to non - constant pairing interaction and an approximate electronic shell structure .",
    "on the other hand , the adaption of the eliashberg theory to the problem of pairing in ultra - small nanoparticles will enable an alternative ( and indeed a far more widely used one in the context of bulk material ) to our similarity renormalization + bcs solution approach , for the calculation of pairing correlations from the underlying electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the details of the solution of the linear elasticity equation of motion can be found in many references @xcite , here we shall cite only the relevant results .",

    "the renormalization is carried out perturbatively and in a manner which avoids small - energy denominators that may appear in ordinary perturbation expansions , or in a single unitary transformation of the initial hamiltonian such as the frhlich transformation ( for more details see @xcite )",
