    "cg  j1720 - 67.8 ( z = 0.045 ) is an ultracompact galaxy group @xcite , whose members have a median projected separation of 6.9 kpc ( h@xmath0 = 75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) , a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath2 65 km s@xmath1 , and show strong signs of mutual interactions .",
    "our previous studies @xcite suggest that this group is very evolved and therefore it offers us the rare chance to study the final evolutionary phases of compact groups ( cgs ) .",
    "we give below a brief description of the group s components , which are labeled in fig .  1 ( top - left ) onto a r - band image obtained at the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "_ galaxy 1 : _ a blue ( b@xmath3v = 0.47 ) starburst galaxy with an exponential bulge and a bulge - to - total light ratio b / t @xmath2 0.4 , whose general properties are consistent with an sc type . since no spiral arms are visible , the galaxy could have lost its outermost layers in the interaction . a bridge of matter",
    "apparently connects this galaxy to galaxy 2 .",
    "_ galaxy 2 : _ an s0 galaxy ( b@xmath3v = 0.88 ) with a de vaucouleurs bulge , which dominates its light ( b / t @xmath2 0.7 ) , and traces of central star formation .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models @xcite suggest that this galaxy might be the result of a @xmath2 1 gyr old merger .    _ galaxy 4 : _ a disk dominated ( b / t @xmath2 0.2 ) , moderately blue ( b@xmath3v = 0.55 ) , starburst galaxy with an exponential bulge .",
    "no obvious spiral arms are visible , but the galaxy shows internal structures , is in close interaction with galaxy 2 , and appears connected to object 3 + 9 , at the base of an outstanding tidal structure ( `` arc '' ) .    _ objects 3 + 9 and 7(+8 ) : _ these objects are actively starforming , blue condensations ( b@xmath3v @xmath2 0.3 ) , a few kpc in size , located at the opposite tips of the group s tidal arc",
    ". they are promising tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) candidates @xcite .",
    "_ objects 10 and 12 : _ these are moderately blue , less concentrated structures located in the central part of the tidal arc .",
    "star formation activity is spectroscopically confirmed for object 10 .",
    "these could be complexes of giant h  ii regions or tdgs in the process of formation .",
    "_ object 11 : _ this knot is embedded in a ring - like structure in the group s optical halo .",
    "is it maybe a vestige of a faded tail formed in the merging process of galaxy 2 ?",
    "integral field spectra in the range 650 - 710 nm have been obtained in june 2002 at the aat with spiral for two 9@xmath4.8@xmath510@xmath4.5 regions with the 14@xmath515 microlens array positioned as in fig .  1 , top - left panel .",
    "each lens imaged 0@xmath4.7@xmath50@xmath4.7 of the source .",
    "the images , reconstructed by integrating the flux between 680 and 690 nm ( h@xmath6+continuum ) , are shown in fig .  1 ( top and bottom central panels ) after magnification and projection onto a 60@xmath556 pixel grid",
    ". the bridges of matter connecting galaxies 1 , 2 , and 4 are evident .",
    "radial velocities were measured in every spectrum , where the h@xmath6 emission line was detected .",
    "the reconstructed velocity fields are shown in fig .  1 ( right - hand panels ) .",
    "galaxy 1 shows a distorted velocity pattern , although the observed velocity gradient across the galaxy is very small ( @xmath2 50 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "galaxy 2 , with a velocity gradient of @xmath2 120 km s@xmath1 in ne - sw direction , shows a counter - rotation with respect to galaxy 1 .",
    "the bridge of ionized gas between the two galaxies shows an intermediate radial velocity , as expected in case of a flow of matter .",
    "a considerable velocity gradient ( @xmath2 200 km s@xmath1 ) is found across the tdg candidate 3 + 9 .",
    "such a gradient , especially at the location of this object , i.e. at the base of the tidal tail , could be a consequence of projection effects or streaming motion along the tail , but it could also indicate the presence of a rotational motion .    a complete coverage of the group with integral field spectroscopy is still needed for a complete view of the complicated group dynamics .",
    "the galaxy group , previously undetected in the radio regime , has been observed with atca in january and february 2002 in the two configurations 750a and 1.5a at the central frequency 1360 mhz with a bandwidth of 8 mhz .",
    "after 2@xmath512 hours synthesis ( synthesized beam fwhm @xmath2 20@xmath4 ) the group still remained undetected in the 21 cm line .",
    "this gives an upper limit to the integrated hi mass of a few 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 , which suggests that the group is hi - deficient , consistent with it being in an advanced evolutionary state @xcite .",
    "instead an extended source with a deconvolved size of 15@xmath9 and an integrated flux of 3.6 mjy , centered on galaxy 4 , was detected in the 20 cm continuum .",
    "a high resolution map ( beam fwhm @xmath2 6@xmath4 ) was obtained by combining the wide - band continuum data with the two atca configurations and including data from the 6 km antenna .",
    "the result , overlapped with the optical image of the group , is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the radio emission approximately follows the optical morphology of the group and has a secondary peak in correspondence of object 7 , one of the most promising tdg candidates .",
    "following haarsma et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we derived an overall star formation rate of @xmath2 17 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 .",
    "+ the new data presented here provide further confirmation of the advanced evolutionary state of cg  j1720 - 67.8 and give additional evidence of the dynamical complexity of this strongly interacting system ."
