    "state - of - the - art quantum technology can trap and experiment with individual atoms , image brains as well as generate structural and dynamical information of biological macromolecules .",
    "numerous applications arising from such emerging techniques involve controlling a large quantum ensemble , e.g. , on the order of avogadro number ( @xmath0 ) , by use of the same control field @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the elements of the ensemble show variations in the values of parameters characterizing the system dynamics , and hence the system hamiltonians of different elements of the ensemble are distinct .",
    "this phenomenon results in a dispersion in the system dynamics .",
    "for example , in magnetic resonance experiments , the spins of an ensemble may have large dispersions in their natural frequencies ( larmor dispersion ) , strength of the applied radio frequency ( rf ) field ( rf inhomogeneity ) , and the dissipation rates of the spins @xcite . in solid state nmr spectroscopy of powder",
    ", the random distribution of the orientations of internuclear vectors of coupled spins within an ensemble leads to a distribution of coupling strengths @xcite .",
    "a canonical problem among these applications is to develop excitations ( control signals ) that will steer such an ensemble of systems with different dynamics from an initial state to a desired final state in finite time using a time - varying electromagnetic pulse . from the perspective of mathematical control theory",
    ", this is a very challenging state transfer problem because it requires steering a continuum of dynamical systems between points of interest in an infinite dimensional state space with the same control function .",
    "this motivates the study of * ensemble control * and the notion of ensemble controllability @xcite described as follows .",
    "consider a parameterized family of control systems @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a smooth function of its arguments and @xmath3 is a compact subset of @xmath4 .",
    "different values of the parameter @xmath5 in ( [ eq : dxs ] ) correspond distinct members of the ensemble @xmath6 showing variations , but we are constrained to use the same open - loop control @xmath7 to steer the whole ensemble .",
    "the existence of such a control raises fundamental questions of _ ensemble controllability_. the formal definition will be given in section [ sec : basics ] . in practice ,",
    "such control designs are called _ compensating pulse sequences _ as they can compensate for or are insensitive to the dispersion in system dynamics .",
    "typical applications include the design of excitation and inversion pulses in nmr spectroscopy in the presence of larmor dispersion and rf inhomogeneity @xcite , the transfer of coherence between a coupled spin ensemble with variations in the coupling strengths @xcite , and the construction of slice selective pulses in mri , where some spins of the ensemble are excited or inverted while the others remain unaffected @xcite .",
    "practical considerations , such as power constraints and signal or information losses due to relaxation effects , make it desirable to construct pulses that achieve a desired level of compensation with minimum energy or in the shortest possible time .",
    "these considerations give rise to problems in _ optimal control of ensembles_. these pulse design problems are widely studied in nmr spectroscopy on the subject of composite pulses that correct the dispersion in system dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic study of the design of compensating pulse sequences has been missing .",
    "the research in ensemble control will give explicit answers to the questions of when a compensation for the system dynamics is possible and how , if possible , to achieve the desired level of compensation .",
    "more generally , ensemble control provides a framework to devise open - loop controls that are robust to parameter uncertainties , namely , they are insensitive to parameters . in many control applications ,",
    "an accurate model is not available and systems have unknown parameters .",
    "they either have some level of uncertainty or are not deterministic , however , there are instead bounds or distributions that describe these parameters .",
    "for example , systems biology models have numerous parameters , such as kinetic constants , which are unknown or only weakly constrained by existing experimental knowledge @xcite . in chaotic dynamics , the problem of parameter uncertainties is unavoidable in synchronizing chaotic systems @xcite . in such scenarios ,",
    "one aims to design controllers that are robust to these parameter uncertainties .",
    "subjects on robust control theory and sliding mode control are well studied to design controllers that can control or stabilize such systems using `` feedback '' @xcite .",
    "while effective , these controllers are closed - loop and dependent on measurement of the system state - at times a difficult , or impossible requirement .",
    "ensemble control , rather , provides a systematic framework for the design of open - loop controls that are immune to parameters and robust to uncertainties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we review ensemble control problems and the notion of ensemble controllability .",
    "we summarize our previous work of steering an ensemble of systems evolving on so(3 ) to highlight the basics of ensemble control .",
    "simple examples of ensemble control of linear systems are addressed to motivate the need of developing ensemble controllability conditions . in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present our main results of necessary and sufficient controllability conditions for ensemble control of finite - dimensional time - varying linear systems . finally , we study optimal control of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators as a demonstration of our main results as well as provide an insight of how ensemble control framework can be adopted to deal with systems with parameter uncertainties .",
    "we show that this system is ensemble controllable and the optimal control of such a system is pertinent to the study of time - frequency limited signals and prolate spheroidal wave functions ( pswf ) .",
    "we present both analytical and numerical solutions .",
    "in this section , we review the basics of the ensemble control and the notion of ensemble controllability @xcite .",
    "ensemble control involves problems of simultaneously manipulating a continuum of dynamical systems with different internal and external dynamics by use of the same open - loop control input .",
    "the general form of an ensemble control system is shown as in ( [ eq : dxs ] ) , and standard linear and bilinear ensemble control systems are of the respective forms @xmath8x(t , s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the investigation of what kind of dispersions @xmath5 in the system dynamics can and can not be corrected is a subject of fundamental and practical importance .",

    "figure [ fig : constrained](b ) shows the @xmath19 distance between the final state and the origin of each harmonic oscillator following the corresponding designed control laws .",
    "in this paper , we studied ensemble control of general time - varying linear systems and derived the necessary and sufficient controllability conditions .",
    "the key idea of understanding controllability relies on investigating the solvability of the integral equation associated with the system dynamics , and it is of fredholm equations of the first kind .",
    "we highlighted the role of singular systems and spectral theorem in designing ensemble control laws , and an analytical optimal control is provided .",
    "the work on computing singular values and eigenfunctions of operators will be pursued .",
    "another interesting topic is to characterize the researchable set for the system under the constrained controls , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "we plan to continue working on extending and generalizing our current results towards the goal of developing a theory of ensemble control .",
