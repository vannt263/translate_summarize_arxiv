    "gravitational recoil during mergers can lead to the ejection of growing seed bhs from their parent halos and can exacerbate the problem @xcite .",
    "an additional difficulty is that models successfully producing the several@xmath28 smbhs by @xmath27 tend to overproduce the number of lower  mass bhs @xcite .",

    "since lw photons propagate nearly unobscured through the high - redshift ( neutral ) intergalactic medium until they redshift into one of the lyman - series transitions of atomic hydrogen , each halo simultaneously sees a large number of lw - sources .",
    "each halo is therefore expected to be exposed to approximately the same lw - flux , close to the global mean level of the background , which is likely to be significantly lower than @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "however , some variation in the lw - flux that irradiates individual dark matter halos is expected .",

    "while this paper was being completed , we became aware of related work by @xcite , who studied the inhomogeneity of the lw background with cosmological simulations .",

    "hence , in order for such a halo to produce a local flux of @xmath179 , it must be @xmath180 times brighter than average .",
    "since this corresponds to @xmath181 , this implies we are not very sensitive to the tail - end of the assumed log  normal distribution of the uv - luminosity of star forming halos ( indeed , in fig .",

    "this is because the highest values of @xmath112 require lyman - werner luminosities that are @xmath191 erg s@xmath10 hz@xmath10 .",
    "hence , producing these fluxes requires the presence of a source that is forming stars at a minimum rate of @xmath192 yr@xmath10 .",
    "prolonged star formation rates of this magnitude can only occur in halos that are more massive than @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , any variation of @xmath108 has a negligible impact on the flux pdf at @xmath154 , as long as @xmath194 ( which seems likely prior to the completion of reionization , e.g. mesinger & dijkstra 2008 ) .",
    "the dissociation of h@xmath18 molecules follows photoexcitation of their electronic states .",
    "there are @xmath195 of these lyman  werner transitions , the majority of them having energies that lie blueward of the ly@xmath196 resonance ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of photons that are capable of dissociating h@xmath18 molecules have therefore redshifted into the ly@xmath196 resonance over a distance that is much smaller than the @xmath106 that was used in our model .",
    "in fact , @xmath106 should have a strong frequency dependence ( for example , some of the lw lines are just on the red side of an atomic h lyman line ; photons could not have suffered significant redshift before reaching such frequencies without scattering , implying small @xmath106 at the frequency of these lw lines ) .",
    "the overall conclusion is that the total photodissociation rate due to far - away sources is reduced , and that our simple modeling which ignores radiate transfer in the igm overestimates the value of the global mean lw - background .",
    "additionally , a trace fraction of molecular hydrogen in the igm ( @xmath197 ) is sufficient to produce an effective optical depth in the lw lines of @xmath198 @xcite",
    ". furthermore , @xmath199 may be enhanced inside `` relic h2 regions '' , which increases the volume - averaged effective optical depth of the igm in the lw lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see shapiro & kang 1987 ) .",
    "@xcite have shown recently that x - rays produced by the first generation of accreting black holes may boost the fraction of intergalactic h@xmath18 by a factor of @xmath200 around such `` miniquasars '' .",

    "[ fig : lywrt ] the _ red - dotted histogram _ shows the lw - flux pdf that is obtained when taking into account this strong frequency dependence of @xmath106 .",
    "we modeled this frequency dependence by computing the maximum distance @xmath202 from which lw[k ] photons ( the k@xmath203 lw transition , when the 76 lw lines are ranked simply in order of increasing energy ) can be received , that is , @xmath204 . here",
    ", @xmath205 denotes the wavelength of the k@xmath203 lw transition .",
    "lw[k ] photons can not by received from sources at larger radii , as these photons redshifted through the lw[k+1 ] resonance first , which makes the igm effectively optically thick to sources beyond @xmath202 .",
    "a source at radius @xmath50 then contributes the following flux to the local lw - background : @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the total photodissociation rate as summed over all 76-transitions , and where @xmath208 is the photodissociation rate that one obtains if one sums over only over those lines for which @xmath209 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lywrt ] shows that in the above , conservative , optically thick limit , our neglect of lw radiative transfer overestimates the value of the mean lw - background by about an order of magnitude , and underestimates the width of the flux pdf .",
    "however , the high-@xmath45 tail of the flux pdf depends entirely on the statistics and nature of very nearby star  forming halos ( within a few to a few tens of kpc )",
    "radiative transfer effects from the igm do not affect this tail of the @xmath45 probability distribution at all , even in this extreme limit .",
    "we also note that lw photons dominate the @xmath12dissociation rate when the medium is optically thick and lacks radiation above 13.6ev .",
    "indeed , the critical value of @xmath210 corresponds to the photo  dissociation time _ due to lw radiation _ being shorter than the free  fall time of the gas . in our case , the column density of neutral hi out to the nearby star ",
    "forming neighbor is likely negligible , and direct photo ",
    "dissociation by photons with energies @xmath211 ev will boost the total @xmath12dissociation rate ( the latter dominates for neutral hi column densities @xmath212 ; @xcite ) . this may help to keep the halo gas @xmath213-free , at least during the early stages of its collapse ( until contraction results in a column density exceeding @xmath214 ) .",
    "lastly , it is worth pointing out that since the tail of the flux pdf is due to a single neighbor , the impinging lw radiation field is highly anisotropic .",
    "the impact of an anisotropic radiation field on the gas could be quite different from that of an isotropic background ( e.g. , perhaps the far side can be shielded more efficiently against the impinging photodissociating flux , which could allow gas to cool and fragment ) , but a quantitative assessment of this 3d behavior is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have found that a fraction of a few @xmath132 of all @xmath59 dark matter halos with @xmath215 k are irradiated by a lw flux that exceeds @xmath36 ( fig .",

    ", we implicitly assumed that @xmath221 ( since we only assumed that a fraction @xmath222 of all halos are actively forming stars ) .",
    "the overall likelihood for a combination of two halos in which one prohibits fragmentation in the other is given by the fraction of occasions in which one halo formed within a time @xmath223 prior to the other during a time @xmath220 .",
    "if the formation times of both halos are uncorrelated , then this probability is given by @xmath224 .",
    "if we write @xmath225 , then we find that @xmath226 . in this case , the reduction due to the synchronization requirement is small for @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , the reduction is significantly less , if the formation times of the two halos are correlated ( which is very likely , since both the collapsing and the star  forming halo formed in the same large",
    " scale overdense region of the universe ) .",
    "the halos of interest that are irradiated by a large lw - flux are also illuminated by ionizing radiation , with an ionizing flux that is lower by a factor of @xmath228 ( the escape fraction of ionizing photons ) than @xmath45 .",
    "this escape fraction is highly uncertain : recently , @xcite have derived a distribution function for @xmath228 from the cumulative hi - column density distribution along sightlines to ( long - duration ) @xmath229-ray burst ( grb ) afterglows .",

    "] by @xcite .    from the above we",
    "conclude that the halos of interest may be irradiated by a ionizing flux that likely has a broad distribution between @xmath233 , with @xmath234 .",
    "to investigate the impact of this photoionizing flux on the dynamics of the gas in collapsing halo , we performed a 1-d hydrodynamical simulation with a code that was originally written by @xcite and modified as described in dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2004 , where it was used to study the impact of photoionization feedback on the formation of dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "we illuminated a gas cloud of mass @xmath235 with an ionizing flux having amplitudes of @xmath236 and @xmath237 , and spectral index @xmath238 ( i.e. the ionizing flux density is given by @xmath239 erg s@xmath10 hz@xmath10 @xmath11 sr@xmath10 ) .",
    "this ionizing flux was switched on at a time @xmath240 before the cloud would have collapsed to @xmath128 in the absence of pressure .",

    "the figure shows that even when @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) , still @xmath241 ( @xmath242 ) of the gas was able to collapse , which implies that photoionization feedback does not prevent the gas from collapsing , even with extremely high uv fluxes .",
    "the main reason for this is that photoionization feedback is most efficient when it can operate for a prolonged time : e.g. in our spherical collapse model , this feedback mechanism has the largest effect when the radiation field is switched on when ( or before ) the gas completely decouples from the hubble flow and starts to collapse .",
    "however , in the final @xmath100 of the cloud s collapse , the gas in the halo has already collapsed to densities that greatly exceed the mean cosmic gas density in the universe , and cooling processes are more efficient .",
    "furthermore , at these high gas densities self - shielding , which is ignored in our simulation , will become important which would make photoionization feedback even less important .",
    "lastly , it is worth pointing out that halos form , and cluster strongly , at intersections of filaments .",
    "the dominating lw - flux will therefore be emitted by halos along the filaments .",
    "on the other hand , their ionizing flux will most likely escape into the low density regions , perpendicular to the filaments .",
    "this argues for a value of @xmath243 that is lower than @xmath244 .",
    "furthermore , the simulations by @xcite suggest that the escape fraction of ionizing photons varies significantly from sightline - to - sightline , with a small fraction of sightlines having @xmath245 , and a significant fraction having @xmath246 ( mainly because of intervening hi and hei ) .",
    "this also implies that it is likely that @xmath247 .",
    "even if a @xmath248 black hole forms as a direct result of the collapse of a gas cloud that was irradiated by a lw flux that exceeded @xmath36 , the black hole still needs to grow to @xmath249 .",
    "this requires the black hole to consume a tremendous amount of gas over @xmath250 gyr ( the total time that elapsed between @xmath59 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "this implies that the original host halo in which the black hole formed , must merge with other halos into a massive @xmath251 host halo ( which also agrees with the mass of the host halos of the @xmath68 quasars ; see , e.g. , the review by haiman & quataert 2004 ) .",
    "interestingly , we found that those @xmath235 halos that are exposed to a lw flux exceeding @xmath36 , are the ones with a nearby star forming galaxy .",
    "the halo mass of this nearby galaxy is possibly as large as @xmath252 ( see   [ sec : param ] ) , and the @xmath248 black hole is likely to end up inside this larger dark matter halo .    utilizing ( * ? ? ? * eq .",

    "this fraction is much larger ( by a factor of @xmath256 ) than the fraction of halos that have close and massive neighbors and are irradiated by a critical flux .",
    "this is strongly suggestive that essentially all of these strongly irradiated halos are in the highly clustered tail of the spatial distribution , and will end up in massive halos , such as those hosting the sdss quasars , by @xmath87 . for reference , we also note that the @xmath253 halos contain a fraction @xmath257 of the total mass at @xmath59 , while @xmath258 halos at @xmath87 have a mass  fraction of @xmath259 at @xmath87 .",

    "while the above discussion shows that a non  negligible fraction of halos may be kept @xmath12free by a strong lw background , another possible effect that could invalidate the direct  collapse black hole formation scenario is the presence of heavy elements in such halos .",
    "indeed , most high  redshift dm halos with @xmath262k may be already enriched with at least trace amounts of metals and dust produced by prior star  formation in their progenitors .",
    "@xcite recently studied the thermal and chemical evolution of low  metallicity gas exposed to extremely strong uv radiation fields .",
    "they find that these metals and any accompanying dust can catastrophically lower the gas temperature , producing an effective equation  of  state index of @xmath263 , even in the presence of a uv background as strong as @xmath264 , which keeps @xmath12 photodissociated .",
    "they suggest that gas fragmentation may thus be inevitable above a critical metallicity , whose value is between @xmath265 ( in the absence of dust ) and as low as @xmath266 ( with a dust - to - gas mass ratio of about @xmath267 , also see omukai 2000 , bromm et al .",
    "2001 , schneider et al .",
    "when the metallicity exceeds these critical values , dense clusters of low  mass stars may form at the halo nucleus . while relatively massive stars in such a cluster could then rapidly coalesce into a single more massive object ( which may produce an intermediate  mass bh remnant with a mass up to @xmath268 )",
    ", the formation of much bhs as massive as @xmath269 by direct collapse is likely to require  in addition to being exposed to a large @xmath36  that the halo gas is also essentially metal  free .",
    "metal enrichment by the nearby star forming galaxy ( that is responsible for the large local lw flux ) , is not necessarily a problem , since the expelled metals most efficiently mix in the outer edge of the collapsing halo , while leaving the inner core pristine @xcite .",
