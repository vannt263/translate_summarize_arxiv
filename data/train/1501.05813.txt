    "the aim of this expository paper is to show that a number of landmark results of nonlinear functional analysis can be quickly obtained from a particular version of the kkm principle at little cost .",
    "this `` elementary kkm  principle '' is due to a. granas and m. lassonde in the framework of super - reflexive banach spaces [ 10 ] .",
    "it is extended to arbitrary topological vector spaces , under a more general compactness hypothesis , with a simpler proof based on the separation of closed convex subsets in a euclidean space ( a result usually discussed in a first course of continuous optimization ) and an intersection theorem of v. l. klee [ 17 ] .",
    "a similar approach is followed to formulate a coincidence theorem for so - called _ von neumann relations_.    the methods outlined here allow for a shorter and simpler alternative treatment of existence results of functional analysis that avoids involved and deeper principles that require sophistication and investment in time .",
    "the kkm  principle is a striking example of such fundamental results . indeed , using the sperner lemma as a starting point , three of the greatest topologists of all times , polish academician s. mazurkiewicz and two of his former  doctoral students , b. knaster and k. kuratowski published in 1929 the celebrated kkm  lemma : a remarkable intersection theorem for closed covers of a euclidean simplex [ 18 ] .",
    "they used the kkm lemma to provide a combinatorial proof of the brouwer fixed point theorem ( the two results being in fact equivalent ) . in 1961 , ky fan extended the kkm  lemma to vector spaces of arbitrary dimensions in what became known as the kkm  principle [ 12 ] .",
    "the kkm  principle inspired countless mathematicians , yielding a formidable body of work in nonlinear and convex analysis ; a production known today as the kkm  theory .",
    "the reader is referred to dugundji - granas [ 7 ] , park [ 20 ] and yuan [ 22 ] for surveys of results , methods , and applications of the kkm  theory .",
    "the particular version of the kkm  principle discussed here , which we call the _ convex kkm  principle _ , is more than sufficient to prove in a direct and economical way , such fundamental results as the stampacchia theorem on variational inequalities , the mazur - schauder theorem on the minimization of lower semicontinuous quasiconvex and coercive functionals , and the markov - kakutani fixed point theorem for commuting families of affine transformations ( see e.g. , brzis [ 6 ] ) .",
    "it is well - known , since kakutani [ 16 ] , that the hahn - banach theorem can be derived from the markov - kakutani fixed point theorem .",
    "thus , the equivalence between the hahn - banach theorem , klee s intersection theorem , the convex kkm  principle , and the markov - kakutani fixed point theorem is thus established .",
    "the fundamental tool for our proof of the convex kkm theorem is the separation of a point and a closed convex set in a finite dimensional space . for the sake of completeness ,",
