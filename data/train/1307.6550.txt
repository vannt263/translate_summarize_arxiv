    "<S> we consider the optical properties of finite systems composed of a series of graphene sheets separated by thin dielectric layers . </S>",
    "<S> because these systems respond as conductors to electric fields in the plane of the graphene sheets and as insulators to perpendicular electric fields , they can be expected to have properties similar to those of hyperbolic metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> we show that under typical experimental conditions graphene / dielectric multilayers have enhanced purcell factors , and enhanced photonic densities - of - states in both the thz and mid - ir frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors can be traced to the coupled plasmon modes of the multi - layer graphene system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these results can be obtained with just a few layers of graphene . </S>"
