    "adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) was proposed by farhi et  al.@xcite in 2000 .",
    "the aqc model is based on the _ adiabatic theorem _ ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "informally , the theorem says that if we take a quantum system whose hamiltonian `` slowly '' changes from @xmath3 ( initial hamiltonian ) to @xmath4 ( final hamiltonian ) , then if we start with the system in the _ groundstate _",
    "( eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue ) of @xmath3 , then at the end of the evolution the system will be `` predominantly '' in the ground state of @xmath4 . the theorem is used to construct _",
    "adiabatic algorithms _ for optimization problems in the following way : the initial hamiltonian @xmath3 is designed such that the system can be readily initialized into its known groundstate , while the groundstate of the final hamiltonian @xmath4 encodes the answer to the desired optimization problem .",
    "the complete ( or _ system _ ) hamiltonian at a time @xmath5 is then given by @xmath6 for @xmath7 $ ] where @xmath8 increases monotonically from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the total running time of the algorithm .",
    "if @xmath11 is large enough , which is determined by the minimum spectral gap ( the difference between the two lowest energy levels ) of the system hamiltonian , the adiabatic theorem guarantees the state at time @xmath5 will be the groundstate of @xmath12 , leading to the solution , the ground state of @xmath13 .",
    "it is believed that aqc is advantageous over standard ( the gate model ) quantum computation in that it is more robust against environmental noise  @xcite . in 2004 , d - wave systems inc . undertook the endeavor to build an adiabatic quantum computer for solving np - hard problems .",
    "kaminsky and lloyd  @xcite proposed a scalable architecture for aqc of np - hard problems .",
    "note that aqc is polynomially equivalent to the standard quantum computation , and therefore aqc is universal .",
    "farhi et  al . in their original paper",
    "@xcite showed that aqc can be efficiently simulated by standard quantum computers . in 2004 , aharonov  et  al  @xcite proved the more difficult converse statement that standard quantum computation can be efficiently simulated by aqc . in this paper , however , we will focus on a subclass of hamiltonians , known as _ ising models in a transverse field _ , that are np - hard but not universal for quantum computation .",
    "this subclass of hamiltonians has been implemented by d - wave systems inc .",
    "d - wave s quantum hardware architecture can be viewed as an undirected graph @xmath1 with weighted vertices and weighted edges .",
    "see figure  [ fig : extendedgrid ] for an example .",
    "denote the vertex set of @xmath1 by @xmath14 and the edge set of @xmath1 by @xmath15 .",
    "each vertex @xmath16 corresponds to a qubit , and each edge @xmath17 corresponds to a coupler between qubit @xmath18 and qubit @xmath19 . in the following",
    ", we will use qubit and vertex , and coupler and edge interchangeably when there is no confusion .",
    "there are two weights , @xmath20 ( called the qubit _ bias _ ) and @xmath21 ( called the _ tunneling amplitude _ ) , associated with each qubit @xmath18 .",
    "there is a weight @xmath22 ( called the coupler _ strength _ ) associated with each coupler @xmath23 . in general",
    ", these weights are functions of time , i.e. , they vary over the time , e.g. , @xmath24 .    the hamiltonian of the ising model in a transverse field thus implemented is : @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( the @xmath27 is in the @xmath18th position ) , similarly for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath31 identity matrix , while @xmath27 and @xmath32 are the pauli matrices given by @xmath33    in general , the transverse field ( i.e. @xmath34 ) encodes the initial hamiltonian @xmath3 , while the other two terms encode the final hamiltonian : @xmath35 one can show ( see appendix ) that the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath4 are encoded in the following energy function of ising model : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , called a _ spin _ , and @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath4 corresponding to the minimum of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 corresponds to its eigenvector ( called _ ground state _ ) of @xmath4 .",
    "when there is no confusion , we use the energy function of ising model and ising hamiltonian interchangeably .",
    "hereafter , we refer the problem of finding the minimum energy of the ising model or equivalently the groundstate of ising hamiltonian as the _ ising problem_. it can be shown that the ising problem is equivalent to the problem of quadratic unconstrained boolean optimization ( qubo)(see  @xcite and references therein ) , which has been shown to be a common model for a wide variety of discrete optimization problems .",
    "more specifically , finding the minimum of @xmath39 in is equivalent to finding the maximum of the following function ( which is also known as quadratic pseudo - boolean function  @xcite ) of qubo on the same graph : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the correspondence between the parameters , @xmath44s and @xmath45s will be shown in section  [ sec : qubo - ising ] .",
    "therefore , given an ising / qubo problem on graph @xmath0 , one can thus solve the problem on an adiabatic quantum computer ( using an ising spin-1/2 system ) if @xmath0 can be embedded as a subgraph of the quantum hardware graph @xmath1 .",
    "we refer this embedding problem as _ subgraph - embedding _ , to be defined formally in section  [ sec : embed ] .",
    "in general , there are physical constraints on the hardware graph @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", there is a _ degree - constraint _ in that each qubit can have at most a constant number of couplers dictated by hardware design .",
    "therefore , besides the possible difficulty of the subgraph - embedding problem , the graphs that can be solved on a given hardware graph @xmath1 through subgraph - embedding must also be degree - bounded .",
    "kaminsky  et  al .",
    "@xcite observed and proposed that one can embed @xmath0 in @xmath46 through ferromagnetic coupling `` dummy vertices '' to solve maximum independent set ( mis ) problem .",
    "] of planar cubic graphs ( regular graphs of degree-3 ) on an adiabatic quantum computer . in particular",
    ", they proposed an @xmath47 square lattice as a scalable hardware architecture on which all @xmath48-vertex planar cubic graphs are embeddable .",
    "the notion of embedding here follows naturally from physicists intuition that each _ logical qubit _ ( corresponding to a vertex in the input graph ) is mapped to a subtree of _ physical qubits _ ( corresponding to vertices in the hardware graph ) that are ferromagnetically coupled such that each subtree of physical qubits acts like a single logical qubit .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] , the logical qubit @xmath49 ( in orange color ) of the graph @xmath0 is mapped to a subtree of physical qubits ( labelled @xmath49 ) of the square lattice .    informally , a minor - embedding @xmath2 of a graph @xmath0 in the hardware graph @xmath1 is a subgraph of @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is an `` expansion '' of @xmath0 by replacing each vertex of @xmath0 with a ( connected ) subtree of @xmath1 , or equivalently , @xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath2 by contracting edges ( same color in figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] ) . in graph theory",
    ", @xmath0 is called a ( graph ) _ minor _ of @xmath1 ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the minor - embedding will be formally defined in section  [ sec : embed ] .",
    "( remark : the embedding in @xcite is a special case of minor - embedding , known as _ topological - minor _ embedding . )    by _ reduction through minor - embedding _ , we mean that one can reduce the original ising hamiltonian on the input graph @xmath0 to the embedded ising hamiltonian @xmath50 on its minor - embedding @xmath2 , i.e. , the solution to the embedded ising hamiltonian gives rise to the solution to the original ising hamiltonian .",
    "the intuition suggests that the reduction will be correct provided that the ferromagnetic coupler strengths used are sufficiently strong ( i.e. , large negative number ) .",
    "however , how strong is `` strong enough '' ? in",
    "@xcite , they do not address this question ,",
    "i.e. what are the required strengths of these ferromagnetic couplers ? in section  [ sec : easy - upper ] , we will show that it is not difficult to give an upper bound for the ferromagnetic coupler strengths and thus explain the intuition .",
    "however , there are indications  @xcite that too strong ferromagnetic coupler strengths might slow down the adiabatic algorithm .",
    "furthermore , an adiabatic quantum computer is an analog computer and analog parameters can only be set to a certain degree of precision ( a condition much more stringent than the setting of digital parameters ) .",
    "hence , the allowed values of coupler strengths are limited .",
    "therefore , from the computational point of view , it is important to derive as small ( in terms of magnitude ) as possible sufficient condition for these ferromagnetic coupler strengths .",
    "furthermore , what should the bias for physical qubits be ?",
    "there are two components to the reduction : _ embedding _ and _ parameter setting_. the embedding problem is to find a minor - embedding @xmath2 of a graph @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "this problem is interdependent of the hardware graph design problem , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the parameter setting problem is to set the corresponding parameters , qubit bias and coupler strengths , of the embedded ising hamiltonian . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the minor - embedding @xmath2 is given , and focus on the parameter setting problem ( of the final hamiltonian ) .",
    "note that there are two aspects of efficiency of a reduction .",
    "one is how efficient one can reduce the original problem to the reduced problem .",
    "for example , here we are concerned how efficiently we can compute the minor - embedding and how efficiently we can compute the new parameters of the embedded ising hamiltonian .",
    "the other aspect concerns about the efficiency ( in terms the running time ) of the adiabatic algorithm for the reduced problem . in general",
    ", the latter depends on the former .",
    "for example , the running time of the adiabatic algorithm may depend on a `` good '' embedding that is reduced to . according to the adiabatic theorem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "the running time of the adiabatic algorithm depends on the minimum spectral gap ( the difference between the two lowest energy levels ) of the system hamiltonian , which is defined by both initial hamiltonian and final hamiltonian .",
    "that is , the running time ( and thus the efficiency of the reduction ) will depend on both the initial hamiltonian and the final hamiltonian . in this paper ,",
    "our focus is only on the final hamiltonian , and therefore we are not able to address the running time of the adiabatic algorithm .",
    "furthermore , the estimation of the minimum spectral gap of the ( system ) hamiltonian is in general hard .",
    "consequently , analytically analyzing the running time of an adiabatic algorithm is in general an open question .",
    "finally , let us remark that there is another different approach based on perturbation theory by oliveira & terhal  @xcite for performing the reduction .",
    "in particular , they employed perturbative gadgets to reduce a 2-local ( system ) hamiltonian to a 2-local hamiltonian on a 2-d square lattice , and were able to show ( as in the pioneering work @xcite ) that the minimum spectral gap ( and thus the running time ) of the system hamiltonian is preserved ( up to a polynomial factor ) after the reduction , for any given initial hamiltonian .",
    "however , besides the ineffective embedding , as pointed out in @xcite , the method is `` unphysical '' as it requires that each parameter grows with the system size .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : qubo - ising ] , we recall the equivalences between the qubo problem and the ising problem . in section",
    "[ sec : embed ] , we introduce the minor - embedding definition and mention related work in graph theory . in section  [ sec : parameters ] , we derive the new parameters , namely values for the qubit bias and the sufficient condition for the ferromagnetic coupler strengths , for the embedded ising hamiltonian such that the original ising problem can be correctly solved through the embedded ising problem . in section  [ sec : wmis ] , we show the embedded ising hamiltonian for solving the ( weighted ) mis problem . finally , we conclude with several related algorithmic problems that need to be investigated in order to facilitate the design of efficient adiabatic algorithms and aqc architectures in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we recall the equivalences between the problem of qubo ( maximization of @xmath51 in eq .  ) and the ising problem ( minimization of @xmath39 in eq .  ) .",
    "notice that @xmath52 , that is , @xmath53 corresponds to @xmath54 , and @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 . using a change of variables",
    ", we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 , the neighborhood of vertex @xmath18 , for @xmath59",
    ".    therefore , @xmath60 in eq .   is equivalent to @xmath61 in eq .",
    "where @xmath62 , or @xmath63 for @xmath59 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : new - parameters ] for the correspondences between parameters in qubo and the ising model .",
    "let @xmath1 be a fixed hardware graph .",
    "given @xmath0 , the _ minor - embedding _ of @xmath0 is defined by @xmath64 such that    * each vertex in @xmath65 is mapped to a connected subtree @xmath66 of @xmath1 ; * there exists a map @xmath67 such that for each @xmath68 , there are corresponding @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "given @xmath0 , if @xmath72 exists , we say that @xmath0 is _ embeddable _ in @xmath1 . in graph theory , @xmath0 is called a _",
    "minor _ of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath72 is clear from the context , we denote the minor - embedding @xmath73 of @xmath0 by @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , one can think of a minor @xmath0 of @xmath1 as a graph that can be obtained from a subgraph of @xmath1 by contracting edges .",
    "see figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] for an example .",
    "in particular , there are two special cases of minor - embedding :    * _ subgraph - embedding : _ each @xmath66 consists of a single vertex in @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath2 ( a subgraph of @xmath1 ) . * _ topological - minor - embedding : _ each @xmath66 is a chain ( or path ) of vertices in @xmath1 .",
    "minors are well - studied in graph theory , see for example  @xcite .",
    "given a _ fixed _",
    "graph @xmath0 , there are algorithms that find a minor - embedding of @xmath0 in @xmath1 in polynomial time of size of @xmath1 , from the pioneering @xmath74 time algorithm by robertson and seymour  @xcite to recent nearly linear time algorithm of b.  reed ( not yet published ) .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to reiterate that these algorithms are for _ fixed _ @xmath0 , and their running times are _ exponential _ in the size of @xmath0 . here",
    "the minor - embedding problem is to find a minor - embedding of @xmath0 ( for any given @xmath0 ) while fixing @xmath1 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only known work related to our minor - embedding problem was by kleinberg and rubinfeld  @xcite , in which they showed that there is a randomized polynomial algorithm , based on a random walk , to find a minor - embedding in a given degree - bounded expander .",
    "our embedding problem might appear similar to the embedding problem from parallel architecture studies .",
    "however , besides the different physical constraints for the design of architectures , the requirements are very different . in particular , in our embedding problem",
    ", we do not allow for _ load _ @xmath75 , which is the maximum number of logical qubits mapped to a single physical qubit .",
    "also , we require _ dilation _ , which is the maximum number of stretched edges ( through other qubits ) , to be exactly 1",
    ". however , all of the existing research on embedding problems for parallel processors  @xcite , at least one of the conditions is violated ( namely either load @xmath75 or dilation @xmath75 ) . in this paper , our focus is on parameter setting such that the reduction is correct , and not on the minor - embedding algorithm and/or the related ( minor - universal ) hardware graph @xmath1 design .",
    "these problems will be addressed in a subsequent paper .",
    "let the qubo problem , specified by @xmath51 and @xmath0 , be given as in eq . , and the corresponding @xmath39 in eq",
    ".. suppose @xmath2 is a minor - embedding of @xmath0 , and let @xmath76 be the embedded energy function associated with @xmath2 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "our goal is to find out the requirement for new parameters , @xmath79s and @xmath80s , such that one can solve the original ising problem on @xmath0 by solving the embedded ising problem on its embedding @xmath2 , or equivalently , such that there is an one - one correspondence between the minimum of @xmath39 ( and thus the maximum of @xmath51 ) and the minimum of @xmath76 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the idea that we can solve the original ising problem ( i.e. finding the groundstate of the ising hamiltonian ) on the input graph @xmath0 by solving the new ising problem on the embedded graph @xmath2 in @xmath1 is that one can use ferromagnetic couplers to connect the physical qubits in each @xmath66 of @xmath2 such that the subtree @xmath66 will act as one logical qubit @xmath18 of @xmath0 .",

    "+ + + + + + + + +    first , we recall that @xmath81 and @xmath82 we distinguish the edges within @xmath66s from the edges corresponding to the edges in the original graph . denote the latter by @xmath83 ,",
    "that is , @xmath84 . ( the black edges in @xmath2 of figure  [ fig : example - embedding ] correspond to @xmath83 . ) for convenience , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "note @xmath88 .",
    "the above intuition suggests that we use the same coupler strength for each original edge , i.e. , @xmath89 for @xmath90 , and use ferromagnetic coupler strength , @xmath91 , for each edge @xmath92 , and redistribute the bias @xmath20 of a logical qubit @xmath18 to its physical qubits in @xmath66 .",
    "that is , we choose @xmath93 for physical qubit @xmath87 such that @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath95      in this section , we derive an easy upper bound for the ferromagnetic coupler strengths .",
    "the derivation is based on the _ penalty or multiplier _ method , in which a constrained optimization is reduced to an unconstrained one by replacing the corresponding expression into the objective function as a penalty term with a large multiplier .",
    "for example , this was used in the reduction from general ( higher - order ) unconstrained binary optimization to the quadratic one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "notice that by construction ( i.e. , @xmath0 is a minor of @xmath2 and @xmath93s are chosen such that @xmath96 ) , minimization of @xmath39 in is equivalent to @xmath97 where the condition @xmath98 for all @xmath99 is equivalent to requiring the spins of physical qubits that correspond to the same logical qubit @xmath18 to be of the same sign .",
    "the corresponding unconstrained minimization is thus @xmath100 which is equivalent to solving eq .",
    "as @xmath101 is a constant .",
    "we are interested in how large ( in terms of magnitude ) @xmath102s are sufficient to guarantee that the solution of eq .",

    "for instance , when @xmath203 , any ( adjacent ) two vertices also has the minimum energy of @xmath204 .",
    "note that we thus can conclude that the ising problem is np - hard because wmis is np - hard .",
    "indeed , barahona  @xcite showed the np - hardness of a special ising problem through the reduction of mis problem on cubic graph ( which remains np - hard ) . notice that for wmis on a planar graph , there is a ptas algorithm  @xcite .",

    "@xcite applied the same technique to obtain a ptas algorithm in @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the approximation ratio .",

    "there are many algorithmic problems related to minor - embedding in aqc that remain to be addressed .",
    "in particular , the problems relate to the efficiency of the reduction .",
    "these problems in turn relate to the running time or complexity of quantum adiabatic algorithms . recall that according to the adiabatic theorem , the running time of an adiabatic algorithm depends on the minimum spectral gap of the system hamiltonian , which however might be as hard as solving the original problem . despite several serious investigations ,",
    "the power of aqc remains an open question  @xcite .",

    "the effect of the embedding and its consequential initial hamiltonian on the complexity of adiabatic algorithms remains to be investigated . in the following we state several main problems that need to investigate in order to facilitate the design of adiabatic algorithms and aqc architectures .",
