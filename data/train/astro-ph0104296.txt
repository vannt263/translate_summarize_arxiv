    "for more than ten years , much effort has been made to understand the properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter ulirgs , see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) , and it is now widely accepted that this population of objects represents an important evolutionary stage triggered by strong galaxy interactions / mergers , especially major mergers between gas - rich spirals with mass ratio smaller than 3:1 ( e.g. , bendo & barnes 2000 ) .",
    "these ulirgs may represent an important stage in the formation of qsos and powerful radio galaxies , as well as an essential step in the formation of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , sanders _ et al . _",
    "1988a ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ) .",
    "although the nature of ulirgs is believed to be understood in general terms , it is still not clear whether these objects originate from the interactions / mergers of galaxy pairs or galaxy groups .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "numerical simulations have successfully reproduced global and even some fine structural properties of elliptical - like galaxies as the results of pair mergers ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; white 1978 ; farouki & shapiro 1982 ; negroponte & white 1983 ; barnes 1992 ; hernquist 1992 ; heyl _ et al .",

    "_ 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; springel & white 1998 ) .",
    "however , the pair merger model can not account for all the observed properties of elliptical galaxies , which leads people to consider the multiple merger scenario ( e.g. , mamon 1987 ; barnes 1984 , 1985 , 1989 ; schweizer 1989 ; weil & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations of multiple mergers do produce remnants different from those produced by pair mergers in both morphological and kinematic properties ( weil & hernquist 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there is increasing observational evidence to support the multiple merger scenario .",
    "for example , the co - existence of three oh maser components in the typical ulirg arp  220 is of possible multiple merger origin ( taniguchi & shioya 1998 ) . and",
    "lipari _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) reported detailed evidence for multiple merger in the luminous infrared galaxy ngc  3256 based on high resolution imaging by _ hst _ and _ eso - ntt_. furthermore , borne _",
    "( 1999a , 1999b ) carried out a thorough ulirgs imaging survey by _ hst _",
    "wfpc2/nicmos , of which they displayed about 20 ulirgs either with multiple nuclei or representing interacting groups ( borne _ et al .",
    "based on their results , borne _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) suggested that a possible progenitor of the ulirg population is compact groups of galaxies .    in optical and near infrared images of luminous merging galaxies , such as ulirgs",
    ", there always exist many kpc or sub - kpc scale intense star - forming regions ( lutz 1991 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; holtzman _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; zepf & ashman 1993 ; surace & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "it has often been argued that these star clusters may form during violent collisions between gas clouds induced by tidal interactions ( hutchings 1995 ) , and that their formation may be linked directly to intense starbursts occurring at the very centers of ulirgs ( taniguchi _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . compared with numerous star - forming regions in nearby interacting systems or starburst galaxies such as ngc  4038/9 ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) , ngc  3310 and ngc  2415 ( gallagher _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , star clusters in ulirgs are generally more luminous and massive , with bolometric luminosity , @xmath0 , sometimes ranging up to @xmath1 and their masses are typically a factor of 100 greater than galactic globular clusters ( scoville _ et al .",
    "a likely explanation is that these objects are associations of star clusters seen in more nearby systems ( surace _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , since the typical intercluster separation in nearby starburst regions is too small ( @xmath2 , see meurer 1995 ) to be resolved at high redshift . since both such star cluster associations and galactic nuclei may appear as local brightness enhancements on ulirg images and the luminosities of the largest associations",
    "can be comparable with those of galactic nuclei , it is necessary to find a feasible criterion to distinguish these two types of objects of different physical nature .",
    "hereafter for convenience , we adopt a nomenclature in which the luminous star - forming regions alone are named as _",
    "knots _ or _ star cluster associations _ , while they are named as _ clumps _ together with galactic nuclei .",
    "although there exists observational evidence for multiple merging from investigations on both individual targets and large samples , most of these works are based on qualitative analysis and use somewhat subjective criteria .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate this issue on a quantitative basis ; this becomes more requisite considering the possibility of mistaking star cluster associations as galactic nuclei in ulirgs , since they are similar in many aspects .",
    "this comprises the main subject of the present paper ; in our work , we perform a careful photometric analysis on a large _ hst _ snapshot imaging survey sample of ulirgs ( borne _ et al .",
    "_ 1999a , 1999b ) , in order to find evidence for multiple merger based primarily on a quantitative criterion of _ i_-band luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , there are still no detailed comparisons of multiple mergers with other populations of ulirgs ( e.g. , double mergers and single nucleus galaxies , see sec . 5 ) .",
    "this provides the second motivation for our paper .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : sec .",
    "2 includes basic information about the ulirg sample and their observations . in sec . 3 , we describe details of our data reduction .",
    "in sec . 4 , we detail our quantitative criterion for identifying putative galactic nuclei . in sec . 5",
    ", we present our main results , i.e. , evidence for multiple mergers and a comparison of different ulirg populations .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our results in sec . 6 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume an einstein - de  sitter cosmology ( @xmath3 ) and adopt @xmath4 . at the typical redshift ( @xmath5 ) of the sample galaxies , @xmath6 ( about 1 pixel )",
    "corresponds to roughly 200pc .",
    "for our purpose , we use archive data from an _ hst _ snapshot imaging survey of ulirgs ( borne _ et al . _ 1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "the sample images were taken using the _ wide field planetary camera 2 _ ( wfpc2 ) in the _ i_-band pass ( f814w ) , including 120 targets all centered in the wf3 chip , of which the resolution is 0.0996per pixel and the fov is @xmath7 pixels .",
    "for each target in this survey , two 400s exposures were taken .",
    "most of the observed targets were selected from the qdot sample ( leech _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; lawrence _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , the rest were selected from the brightest samples of sanders _",
    "( 1998a , 1998b ) and melnick & mirabel ( 1990 ) .",
    "apart from some sources which are saturated , mis - focused or contaminated by bright foreground stars , we make use of 97 independent targets for our study . in addition , all these sources are selected to possess projected nuclear separations less than 20kpc ( for galaxies with more than two putative nuclei , only minimum nuclear separations are considered ) .",
    "this is because generally speaking , _ strong interactions _ between galaxies are induced in systems with nuclear separations below this value , i.e. , the distance adequate for two interacting galaxies to obtain a substantial disturbance down to their nuclear radii of 1 - 2kpc within the lifetime of the encounter ( e.g. , lin _ et al .",
    "basic information for all the targets is listed in table 1 in the order of increasing _ ra _ , including _",
    "hst _ visit no .",
    ", target name , _ ra _ , _ dec _ , redshift , far - infrared luminosity and our classification ( see sec .",
    "the redshifts of these objects range from 0.04 to 0.35 .",
    "the sample images were first preprocessed through the _ standard space telescope science institute _ ( stsci ) pipeline , using a standard wfpc2-specific calibration algorithm and the best available calibration files ( holtzman _ et al .",
    "the preprocessing consists of mask and analog - to - digital correction , bias and dark subtraction , as well as flat - fielding , etc .. our post - pipeline calibrations include detection and removal of warm pixels and cosmic ray events .",
    "the additional steps of data reduction are discussed below .",
    "we use the standard _ iraf _ task _ imexamine _ to carefully browse the sources in the ulirg sample . for each target",
    ", three plots are displayed and compared with each other  the contour plot , the surface plot and the snapshot image .",
    "the image is adjusted to different greyscale levels until it renders the best visualization .",
    "the surface plot is always checked from several different angles to get a full view .",
    "a set of ceiling values are tried until the contour plots yield a clear view of the weak structures of the targets . by careful comparison ,",
    "common local brightness enhancements appearing on each plot are marked as putative clumps . on surface plots , such clump candidates are identified on the basis of detectable brightness peaks ; while on contour plots , they are identified on the basis of closed isophotal contours . as for snapshot images , it is hard to resolve them by greyscale adjustment to present all the clumps detectable in surface or contour plots , except for those very bright or compact clumps with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , snapshot images are especially useful in that interacting structures in ulirgs are more perceptible in these plots , and such structures are very useful for determining whether or not several distinct separate regions near the target position belong to a single dynamically related system .",
    "this is done based on the existence of detectable tidal streamers connecting separate regions .",
    "otherwise , we identify the object nearest to the iras position as the target we need , and its nearby objects are considered to be either foreground or background ones ( see also sec .",
    "hence our method will give a ( conservative ) lower limit on the fraction of multiple merger objects .    in order to distinguish true physical clumps from poisson fluctuation peaks in the images , we make rough",
    "fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) measurements on the marginally detectable brightness peaks , and fluctuations are identified to be those peaks with fwhms smaller than the typical value of observed psf ( point spread function ) of _ hst _ wf3 chip with f814w filter .",
    "furthermore , it can not be ruled out that foreground stars may coincidently fall onto the target and are thus mistaken as ulirg clumps .",
    "a rough estimation of this probability is made using all the 7 ulirgs in the sample at relatively low galactic latitude ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "we use the standard _ iraf _ task _ daofind _ to search for star - like objects in these 7 ulirgs which are brighter than the minimum clump flux we have identified in the sample ( about 22.5mag ) . and by multiplying the star number by the ratio of the target area to the whole field area , we obtain an average contamination number of about 0.1 for one galaxy , hence the influence of star contamination on our results is negligible . here the area occupied by each target is determined by counting the number of pixels with adu values at least @xmath9 above the sky background .",
    "this is a conservative upper limit , since the sub - sample we treat is contaminated by foreground stars to the greatest extent due to low galactic latitude .",
    "we perform surface photometric measurements on the selected clumps to determine their _ i_-band fluxes and luminosities . for well - separated clumps ,",
    "we apply standard aperture photometry programs in which aperture widths are set to different values according to their actual sizes , ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 .",
    "the size is estimated from the surface brightness profile when it reaches an approximately constant value , i.e. , the local background value .",
    "in addition , estimates are made of the underlying background galaxy flux by using the mean of the pixels in a 1-pixel annulus immediately outside the photometric aperture . however , some clumps in ulirgs are so close that their profiles overlap notably , hence standard procedures do not function well . in such cases",
    "we perform surface photometry in the following way : we apply a large aperture size to encircle all the overlapping clumps and the magnitude , @xmath10 , measured this way is considered to be the combined _ i_-band magnitude of encircled objects ; at the same time we apply a small aperture size to measure the magnitude , @xmath11 , of the protrudent part ( i.e. , non - overlapping region ) of each encircled clump , and the flux ratio of these parts is approximated as that of the corresponding true clumps , assuming that these overlapping clumps possess similar profiles . using @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we can estimate the true magnitude of clumps from the following expression , @xmath14 @xmath15 in all our surface photometry , the photometric calibration is performed using published photometric solutions for wfpc2 and f814w filter ( holtzman _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "simulations are performed in order to estimate the uncertainty of the measured fluxes for overlapping clumps . using the standard _",
    "task _ mkobjects _ , we automatically produce two objects ( artificial clumps ) with different flux ratios and separations .",
    "their fwhms are fixed to be 5pixels . for convenience , only de  vaucouleurs",
    "brightness profiles are considered . in addition",
    ", poisson noise is added to the simulated objects and the effects of detector gain , readout and psf are all modeled using the appropriate parameters for the _ hst _ wf3 chip .",
    "table 2 lists details of each simulation run . from the table",
    ", we can see that the largest photometric uncertainty occurs when the separations between clumps are small and the corresponding magnitude difference of simulated clumps is high . since there are no overlapping clumps in this sample with very different _",
    "i_-band magnitude , the typical photometric uncertainty introduced by our technique is less than 0.2mag , and the largest uncertainty in our measurements , corresponding to run 12 in table 2 , is around 0.5mag .",
    "hence the introduced photometric uncertainty does not affect our results significantly .",
    "as mentioned in sec . 1 ,",
    "one of the remarkable features of ulirgs is that there always exist many kpc or sub - kpc scale luminous clumpy structures ; and the key issue in our work is to distinguish putative nuclei from star cluster associations",
    ". it is found that typical masses for both galactic nuclei in ulirgs and the giant elliptical cores are several times of @xmath16 ( sakomoto _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; lauer 1985 ) .",
    "this is typically larger than the mass found for star formation knots . in detailed studies of nearby starburst galaxies such as m82 ( de grijs _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , no star - forming knots have been observed to possess masses as high as @xmath16 . and",
    "for the nearest ulirg , arp  220 , its most massive knot was found to possess a mass of @xmath17 ( shioya _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . on the theoretical side , complexes with masses greater than @xmath16 may suffer from disintegration ( noguchi 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , taniguchi _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that a large mass of @xmath16 corresponds to a maximum star formation efficiency of 1 for knots evolving from superclouds in gravitationally unstable gas disks .",
    "since the real star formation efficiency must be smaller ( e.g. , 0.1 from observations of the galaxy ) , observed knots are always less massive than @xmath16 .",
    "given these , we conservatively adopt @xmath18 as the lower mass limit to pick out putative nuclei from bright clumps in the first step .    to express the above threshold in an observational quantity",
    ", the lower mass limit is converted to _ b_-band luminosity using a constant mass - to - light ratio of 6.5 appropriate for spheroids ( fugukita _ et al .",
    "and the resultant value of @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath20 . adopting the statistical results of surace _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) that the typical @xmath21 color index for putative nuclei in ulirgs is 2.0 with a root mean square of 0.7 , we obtain the lower @xmath22 limit of @xmath23mag as a quantitative criterion to pick out putative nuclei from bright clumps .",
    "this is consistent with the argument that bright knots may have an upper luminosity limit for intense star - formation in a star cluster ( hutchings 1995 ) .",
    "we caution that this quantitative criterion may not be sufficient to pick out ulirg nuclei in some cases .",
    "this is mainly due to two reasons .",
    "first , the brightest knots and relatively faint nuclei in ulirgs may have comparable luminosities .",
    "second , the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of ulirgs are heavily obscured  as a result , a single nucleus may emerge as multiple condensations due to complex obscuration patterns . in order to eliminate the influences of these two effects ,",
    "we take further morphological considerations , which are discussed below .      generally speaking , in order to distinguish those extremely bright knots from the putative nuclei , color information is needed ( e.g. , surace _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , scoville _",
    "et al . _ 1999 ) .",
    "however , we do not incorporate color index in this paper , because the ulirgs imaging survey sample we used was performed only in the _ i_-band .",
    "in addition , the results of @xmath21 color show that this index covers a rather wide range from @xmath240.3 to 5.2 for star - forming knots ( surace _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . considering the relatively narrow span of 0.5 to 3.1 for putative nuclei ( surace _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , it is obvious that knots can be either bluer or redder than nuclei , as was also pointed out by hutchings ( 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , the color index is not an ideal indicator to distinguish putative nuclei from star formation knots .    on the other hand ,",
    "although the luminosities of some super star clusters are comparable to or even greater than those of putative galactic nuclei , this luminosity overlap is relatively insignificant compared with the overlap of color index . among all the 57 knots in surace s sample , less than 30% are brighter than our _ i_-band luminosity threshold of @xmath2417.0mag ( see fig 1 for the magnitude distribution of all these 57 knots ) .",
    "furthermore , we suspect that some of these very bright knots in surace s sample are possible galactic nuclei ( see sec",
    ". 6.1 ) .",
    "star - forming knots with large _ i_-band luminosities ( i.e. , comparable to those of putative nuclei ) may also exist in the current ulirg sample . to rule them out on a single wavelength basis , we take into account the dynamical information provided by interacting signatures of the targets .",
    "this technique led lipari _",
    "( 1999 ) to detect three galactic nuclei in ngc  3256 based on _ hst _ and _ eso - ntt _ observations . therefore , after applying the quantitative criterion of @xmath22 , we carefully examine the local ( such as nuclear arms and disks ) as well as global ( such as tidal tails , plumes , rings ) environments of the sample targets to confirm whether or not clumps brighter than @xmath25 are actual descendents of progenitor bulges .",
    "both numerical simulations and observations show that each piece of such signatures is connected to at least one nucleus residing at its starting position ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; wright 1972 ) . because of this",
    ", some very bright clumps ( i.e. , brighter than @xmath23mag ) are still treated as massive star - forming regions if they are located in the outer parts of the sample targets ( e.g. , at the tips of tail structures ) .",
    "such objects are more likely to be tidal galaxies produced by merging ( fellhauer & kroupa 2000 ) , hence they are not included in our work . in our sample , there are 22 such clumps brighter than @xmath23mag in the _",
    "i_-band which are removed due to these morphological considerations . compared with the total number of putative nuclei of nearly 200 , this step ,",
    "although important , should not affect our statistical results .",
    "this morphological consideration works fairly well , since in most of our cases , such interacting signatures are easy to identify and their geometrical connections to bright clumps in the same images are explicit .",
    "thus this technique eliminates at least some of the uncertainties in our identification of putative nuclei due to the luminosity overlaps between nuclei and knots .",
    "however , it should still be notified that some levels of subjectivity can not be avoided in the morphological considerations mainly due to two reasons .",
    "the first is that faint interacting signatures may be buried in the background noise and are not detectable , especially for the targets at relatively high redshift .",
    "the second is that the starting positions of these structures are unclear in some cases .",
    "e.g. , it is not clear how to pick out the putative nuclei from a group of clumps located along a tidal ring , purely from morphological signatures .",
    "since some features of interacting systems may be due to quirks of pre - encounter disks and do not lead to fundamental insights ( barnes 1999 ) , it is not surprising that we sometimes have ambiguous circumstances . in such cases",
    ", we simply apply our quantitative magnitude criterion to identify putative nuclei .      since the high far - infrared luminosity of ulirgs results from thermal re - radiation from dust ( sanders & mirabel 1996 )",
    ", there is no doubt that ulirg morphologies tend to be affected by dust obscuration .",
    "images taken at longer wavelength are needed to examine the extent to which the morphologies of the sample targets are influenced .",
    "for the near infrared images of 9 ligs plus 15 ulirgs taken by hst nicmos camera ( at 1.1 , 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath26 m ) , it was stated that although new interacting features as well as new super star clusters could be found at longer wavelengths , no new nuclei were seen in these images ( scoville _ et al .",
    "this fact suggests that global morphologies are not greatly affected by dust obscuration effects at optical wavelengths , and hence our identification of putative nuclei should be reasonably secure .",
    "in fact , to further minimize the above - mentioned effect , some targets in the sample were treated separately , as in the cases of ir09427@xmath271929 , ir06361@xmath246217and ir04024@xmath248303 , etc .",
    "although these targets show signs of separate nucleus components , the combined shapes of their brightness profiles and loss of any nearby signatures of on - going interactions suggest that they are more likely to be a single nucleus split by a foreground dust lane .",
    "( 1998 ) have reported such cases in their warm ulirg sample , e.g. , ir05189@xmath242524 .",
    "this procedure is also consistent with borne _",
    "_ s criterion that only cases with clearly separated optically luminous galactic components were selected ( borne _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) .",
    "to summarize , the identification of putative galactic nuclei in our reduction includes two steps .",
    "the first step is to apply directly an _ i_-band luminosity criterion , in which all the ulirg clumps brighter than @xmath2417.0mag were considered as nucleus candidates for further consideration .",
    "the second step is to include morphological information ( primarily , the existence and characteristics of tidal features ) , in order to remove some super star clusters with _",
    "i_-band luminosities comparable to those of putative nuclei .",
    "only nuclei which pass through these two criteria are considered as putative galactic nuclei . in the next section ,",
    "we present statistical analyses of this group of objects .",
    "based on the quantitative criterion discussed in sec . 4 as well as morphological structures , we pick out all the putative galactic nuclei from clumpy structures in each sample galaxy . and",
    "all the 97 ulirgs can be classified as three categories according to the number of their nuclei :    * multiple nuclei ulirgs ( multiple mergers ) * double nuclei ulirgs ( double / pair mergers ) * single nucleus ulirgs ( single remnants )    note that for the double nuclei category , two galaxies with projected nuclear separations of more than 20kpc are excluded ( ir13156@xmath270435 and ir15168@xmath270045 ) .",
    "hence these three categories compose a nearly complete sample of _ strong interacting systems and their remnants with ultraluminous far - infrared luminosities_. note that here we adopt a working assumption that every nucleus present in merging systems corresponds to a single progenitor nucleus ( bulge ) , i.e. , we assume that dynamical processes ( such as tidal disruption ) can not produce compact regions with masses beyond @xmath28 .",
    "we caution that this assumption , while reasonable , needs to be verified using numerical simulations .",
    "photometric results of all the putative nuclei in the sample are listed in tables 3 , 4 and 5 for the three categories , respectively , including positions and _ i_-band absolute magnitudes . in all these tables ,",
    "nucleus positions are expressed by _",
    "ra _ and _ dec _ relative to the corresponding target positions given in table 1 , which are fixed to pixel coordinate of ( 420,424 ) in the _ hst _ wf3 chip . for multiple and double mergers",
    "( see tables 3 and 4 ) , projected nuclear separations as well as luminosity ratios are included , and we only give minimum separations for the multiple nuclei category .",
    "furthermore , some basic information about the targets are also listed in these tables , including tail lengths , brief comments on morphology and available spectral types .",
    "our results show that among all the 97 ulirgs of the treated sample , 17 are multiple nuclei systems , 38 are double nuclei systems , while the remaining 42 have only one identifiable galactic nucleus .",
    "this gives plausible fractions of ulirgs with multiple , double and single nucleus / nuclei as 18% , 39% and 43% , respectively .",
    "these results evidently support the multiple merger scenario as a possible origin of ulirgs , in addition to the widely - accepted pair merger picture .",
    "this argument was put forward by borne _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) based on the same sample .",
    "however , our results are obtained in a more objective way due to our mainly quantitative criterion . comparisons between borne",
    "s results and ours are presented in sec .",
    "in addition , further statistical studies on this large sample reveal some differences among the three ulirg categories in our taxonomy , some of which give hints to a possible evolutionary sequence from multiple mergers to double mergers and then to single merger remnants ( hereafter m@xmath29d@xmath29s sequence , see sec .",
    "these results not only support our classification scheme , but also give some insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions / mergers ( see sec .",
    "besides putative nuclei , there often exist several bright knots in most of the sample galaxies .",
    "one of the significant characteristics of these bright knots is that they tend to distribute around nuclear regions , or in regions between / among separate nuclei .",
    "this is consistent with the argument that star - forming concentrations are preferentially situated along the overlapping areas of interacting galactic disks ( scoville _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . besides these nuclear knots",
    ", there are also cases with circum - nuclear knots , or even with knots residing at the tips of tidal tails . as pointed out by weilbacher _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , a possible descendent of such objects at the tips of tidal tails is tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "another tendency is that bright knots are less frequently seen in single nucleus ulirgs , compared with multiple / double mergers .",
    "we plan to study the properties of these bright knots and investigate their formation mechanisms and evolutionary fates in a future work .",
    "table 3 gives the information on each nucleus for all the 17 multiple mergers , while the _ hst _ _ i_-band images , surface plots and contour plots are shown in figs . 1 - 17 ( arranged from left to right , respectively ) .",
    "we put plus marks on each image to indicate the positions of putative nuclei , and the orientation of the image is indicated by the headed north arrow and the unheaded east arrow . since pixel spacings are not always the same for the two axes , the north and east directions may sometimes be oblique .",
    "the orientation of each contour plot is selected to be the same as the snapshot image for direct comparison .",
    "for the three - dimensional surface plot , we rotate it along both horizontal and vertical viewing directions until it renders the best sight to view each nucleus clearly . in addition , for each multiple merger candidate , the snapshot image and the contour plot both contain distance scale rulers , and the scale of the surface plot is selected to be the same as that of the contour plot . for the 17 multiple merger systems , the morphologies , the relative positions and numbers of putative nuclei as well as knots",
    "are very different .",
    "we give a description of each target in turn .    this galaxy is mainly composed of two parts separated by 4.3kpc . the northeastern part contains a single nucleus , while the southwestern part consists of two close nuclei with a projected separation of only 570pc .",
    "bright knots of the system preferentially distribute to the southwest of each nucleus .",
    "there is a 45kpc tidal tail starting from the northeastern nucleus and curving to the south .",
    "in addition , the contour plot of ir00161@xmath240850presents distinct arm structures connected to both parts of the system .",
    "these structures may be remnants of progenitor spiral arms which have not been completely destroyed by the merging process .    the western part of ir02364@xmath244751contains the brightest nucleus of the system , while the eastern part is composed of two close nuclei separated by 540pc .",
    "the projected distance between the two parts is about 2.6kpc and several bright knots can clearly be seen between them .",
    "a 50kpc tidal tail starts at the eastern nucleus pair and curves from the east to the west .",
    "a faint plume structure can also be seen starting from the western nucleus and stretching to the southwest .",
    "a possible evolutionary scenario is that two spirals merge first and produce the long tail we see ; before they finally evolve into a single object , a third galaxy approaches from their western side , which makes up a system with three putative nuclei .",

    "these putative nuclei are also connected with a 14kpc tail curving from the east to the west .",
    "a possible explanation of this peculiar morphology is that two galaxies interact to produce a tidal tail , and before their bulges finally merge together , a third galaxy impact on them perpendicular to their disk planes , which results in the ring structure we see now .",

    "in addition , two other nuclei brighter than @xmath31mag are located along the two spiral arms .    surface and contour plots of ir14575@xmath273256show clearly that there are three distinct putative nuclei in the system . a close pair separated by 1kpc",

    "in fact , there are two closely separated clumps in the southwestern _ bar _ which are both brighter than @xmath33mag .",
    "however , due to their contour shapes , these two clumps appear to be a single nucleus split by a foreground dust lane ( as in the case of ir05189@xmath242524 , see surace _ et al .",
    "hence we conservatively take them as a single object , and the @xmath22 value listed in table 3 is the combined magnitude of these two objects .",

    "the projected separation between these two parts is about 5kpc .",

    "the southwestern part of this system consists of two close nuclei separated by 600pc and their connecting line is perpendicular to the northeastern ring plane .",
    "in addition , there exists a tidal bridge connecting these two parts .",
    "this is a three nuclei ulirg with very peculiar morphology .",
    "the bright object located in the center is composed of two close nuclei separated by 1.2kpc , while another much fainter nucleus resides to their northeast . a clear tidal bridge can be seen connecting these two parts , and several bright knots are distributed just along the bridge .",
    "two plume structures of length 6kpc and 18kpc start from the central nucleus pair and curve in opposite directions .",

    "i_-band luminosity as high as @xmath36 .",
    "the nucleus located 1.2kpc to the southeast of the central bright nucleus and the one 2.4kpc to the west are much fainter .",
    "in addition , bright star - forming knots of the system are preferentially distributed around the western nucleus . a multiple merger scenario of this system is also supported by its complex morphology with a 11kpc tidal tail and two other plume structures .",
    "from the snapshot image , this is a galaxy with a relatively simple and regular morphology .",
    "a distinct tidal tail about 19kpc long starts from the central bright object and stretches from the northwest to the southeast .",
    "the central object is in fact composed of three close nuclei all brighter than @xmath37mag , and around them there are several bright star - forming knots of the system .",
    "the three progenitor galaxies of this system are likely to have begun to merge almost simultaneously .",
    "as described above , all of the targets listed in table 3 encompass at least three putative nuclei and most of them clearly show signs of strong interaction activities . such large scale tidal features coined as _ tidal traumas _ ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ) include tails , bridges , rings , plumes , etc . in some systems with very peculiar morphologies , different types of tidal features may co - exist , such as several tails or plumes ( e.g. , ir22206@xmath242715 in fig .",
    "15 ) . borne _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) suggested that merging pairs of spirals alone can not account for all the dynamical diversities of ulirgs , and numerical simulations also support that such complex structures tend to appear in multiple merger systems ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "the _ i_-band magnitude distributions of putative nuclei for the whole sample and the three different categories are presented in figs .",
    "18a - d , respectively .",
    "the faint side cutoff in figs .",
    "18b and 18c ( multiple and double nuclei galaxies ) is set by our criterion . in fig .",
    "18d ( single nucleus galaxies ) , the faint side cutoff is at @xmath33mag .",
    "this might be due to the merger - induced formation of massive and bright bulges in these systems .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a distinct high luminosity tail above @xmath38 in fig .",
    "this corresponds to a seyfert  1/qso excess in single nucleus ulirgs , since most nuclei brighter than @xmath39mag ( 9 out of 13 with available spectra ) belong to galaxies with seyfert  1/qso spectra ( see tables 3 , 4 and 5 ) .",
    "in addition , seyfert  1/qso nuclei can occasionally be found in multiple / double mergers ( e.g. , ir20037@xmath241547and ir00204@xmath271029 ) , and there is either likelihood that these bright nuclei are primordial objects before merger or in fact evolutionary descendents of previous merging steps .",
    "the magnitude distributions of multiple / double mergers and single nucleus galaxies give a median _",
    "i_-band magnitude of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , respectively .",
    "the high median luminosity for the single nucleus category is partly due to the merger - induced formation of massive , bright bulges , and partly due to the triggering of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) phenomenon in a substantial fraction of merger remnants , as mentioned above .",
    "in addition , these three categories do not show much difference in the @xmath44 distribution width .",
    "although magnitude distributions of multiple and double mergers do not present much differences , it is obvious from the comparison of figs .",
    "18b and 18c that bright nuclei ( i.e. , from @xmath37 to @xmath45 ) tend to appear more often in double nuclei systems ( nearly twice as often than in multiple mergers ) .",
    "this gives some hints to a possible evolutionary sequence from galaxy groups to merger remnants with a single nucleus , along which the double nuclei systems remain as intermediate products ( m@xmath29d@xmath29s sequence ) .    to check this m@xmath29d@xmath29s merger sequence ,",
    "we calculate the luminosity ratio of each nucleus to the brightest one in the same target .",
    "our results show that nearly 40% of the double merger ulirgs contain two nuclei with mass ratio more than 3:1 ( assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio for bulge ) .",
    "although spiral galaxies might possess rather different bulge - to - disk mass ratios , it can not be ruled out that a substantial fraction of putative nuclei in pair merger are likely to be merger remnants of previous galaxy encounters , since ulirgs are postulated to arise from mergers of two comparably massive gas - rich spiral galaxies ( e.g. , mihos 1999 ) .",
    "this gives further support to a possible m@xmath29d@xmath29s evolutionary sequence .",
    "further investigation based on the optical spectra available in the literature ( lawrence _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; veilleux _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) as well as the information from ned and our observations shows that about 64% ( 7/11 ) seyfert  1/qso in this _ hst _ snapshot imaging survey sample belong to galaxies with a single nucleus .",
    "this gives an important hint that the seyfert  1/qso phenomenon tend to appear at the final stage of galaxy interactions / mergers when separate nuclei have merged together .",
    "table 6 gives the detailed statistics of different spectral types for the three categories .",
    "it shows that the proportions of region - like spectra are 64% ( 9/14 ) , 35% ( 8/21 ) and 20% ( 5/25 ) for multiple , double and single nucleus / nuclei galaxies , respectively . while the agn proportions for these three categories are 36% ( 5/14 ) , 65% ( 13/21 ) and 80% ( 20/25 ) .",
    "this clear trend of gradually changing proportions of different spectral types suggests that the m@xmath29d@xmath29s sequence is also one with changing energetics : from starburst - dominated to central agn - dominated .",
    "of course , it should be mentioned that the -like spectra in some objects may be due to the super star clusters rather than the identified putative nuclei , which is consistent with the fact that the images of these targets are distributed by knotty structures in their circumnuclear regions ( e.g. , ir14202@xmath272615and ir18580@xmath276527 ) .",
    "tables 3 and 4 list the projected nuclear separations for multiple and double nuclei ulirgs .",
    "we present the corresponding distributions in fig .",
    "given the _",
    "wfpc2 resolution limit , our measurements can not probe separations below several hundred parsecs , except for some low redshift galaxies . at the maximum redshift in the sample , @xmath46 , our measurements",
    "can only probe nuclear separations larger than 1.5kpc . therefore the distribution of nuclear separations less than this value is incomplete .",
    "this incompleteness is particularly serious at separations below 0.5kpc , since very few targets in this sample are at low redshift ( i.e. , less than 20% with redshift smaller than 0.1 ) .",
    "this is shown by the sharp decrease below 500pc in fig .",
    "we also give the same distribution based on results from the literature ( surace _ et al _ 1999 ; evans 1999 ; rigopoulou _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; murphy _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; clements _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) in fig .",
    "19(b ) for comparison .",
    "one significant feature of our results is that there is a high fraction ( 3/4 ) of nucleus pairs with projected separations less than 5kpc , which is much higher than the result from the literature ( 1/3 ) .",
    "the reason for this large difference is mostly due to the low resolution limit of ground - based observations in previous works .",
    "this result supports that systems at late merging stage preferentially host ulirg galaxies ( mihos 1999 ) .",
    "20 displays the correlation between nuclear separations and tail lengths .",
    "most of the data points are distributed in the lower left conner of the plot . however , considering that both the minimum separations and tail lengths applied here are projected values , the distribution profile of data points is more instructive .",
    "20 shows a weak trend of smaller nuclear separations coupled to longer tidal tails .",
    "simple qualitative analysis suggests a picture that when galaxies first encounter at a relatively large distance , their mutual tidal field is not strong enough to produce long tail structures ; and when they are drawn closer as the merging process proceeds , disk stars in each galaxy are catapulted farther out and tidal tails continue to lengthen .",
    "this picture is consistent with numerical simulations ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; wright 1972 ) .",
    "however , there do exist several examples with both long tails and large nuclear separations ( e.g. , ir21547@xmath245823 ) .",
    "this might imply that at least one nucleus in such systems is in fact an evolutionary descendent of a previous merging process , or merely that the resolution limit of _ hst _ prevents us from probing fine structures at its very center . considering this , the multiple merger fractions we determined at the beginning of sec .",
    "5 might be an under - estimate of the true fraction .",
    "in addition , relatively short tail structures can occasionally be found in single nucleus ulirgs .",
    "this further strengthens the case that these systems are merger remnants of previous galaxy encounters .",
    "of course , our measurements of tail length carry an obvious bias : the observable tidal tails at a given surface brightness in distant galaxies tend to be shorter than their nearby counterparts even if they have the same physical lengths , due to the @xmath47 surface brightness dimming .",
    "however , since the sample targets do not cover a wide range of redshifts ( 0.04@xmath290.35 ) , this effect should not influence our statistical results significantly .",
    "based on our quantitative criterion as well as morphological features , we obtain the fractions for multiple , double and single nucleus / nuclei ulirgs as 18% , 39% and 43% , respectively .",
    "a question is why there is no report of multiple merger cases in other sample studies on ulirgs , e.g. , in the sample of surace _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) . to test the consistency between these two results",
    ", we directly apply an upper mass limit of @xmath16 on their results of ulirg knots as well as putative nuclei , and find that two targets in their sample ( ir12071@xmath240444 and ir15206 + 3342 ) should be classified as multiple mergers , namely , there are at least three clumps too massive to be explained as star cluster associations in each of these two targets . considering this ,",
    "the fraction of multiple nuclei ulirgs in surace s sample is 22% , very close to our result of 18% .",
    "the main reason why surace _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) did not choose these objects as multiple merger systems might be that only the one or two brightest clumps in their sample were believed to plausibly represent putative nuclei .",
    "this means the pair merger origin was considered to be the only evolutionary picture for ulirgs",
    ". this assumption may sometimes give rise to some inconsistencies or ambiguities .",
    "this is especially true in the case of ir12071@xmath240444 . for this system",
    ", there are three bright objects that have comparable masses ( several times @xmath16 ) , but only one of them was selected as a putative nucleus . furthermore , this identified nucleus also possesses @xmath48 , @xmath44 and @xmath21 values just between those of the other two bright clumps ( see table 2 of surace _ et al .",
    "this means that at least this putative nucleus does not show distinguished features compared with some other clumps in the same target .",
    "thus it is possible that any of the three brightest clumps in ir12071@xmath240444 represent putative nuclei . on the other hand , in our work",
    ", the putative nuclei were identified independent of the evolutionary origin for ulirgs , in order to check the possibility of the multiple merger scenario proposed by some researchers .",
    "based on the same sample , the multiple merger candidates selected by borne _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) include 9 ulirgs classified as multiple nuclei galaxies and 8 ulirgs classified as interacting groups ( three multiple mergers in borne s classification are absent from our subsample , and are therefore not discussed here ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "snapshot imaging survey sample does include a fraction of ulirgs which are very likely to be located within galaxy groups from their images , since there are several bright or dwarf galaxies surrounding them .",
    "however , we did not consider them as multiple merger systems except when the central target contains at least three putative nuclei or is connected with some of its companions by obvious interacting signatures .",
    "this is because further redshift observations need to be performed for confirmation .",
    "these group candidates include ir00335@xmath242732 , ir01031@xmath242255 , ir06268@xmath273509 , ir13342@xmath273932 and ir22546@xmath242637 .",
    "in fact , we have carried out some spectroscopic observations using the 2.16 m telescope at the xinglong station of beijing astronomical observatory and identified several luminous / ultraluminous iras galaxies located in galaxy groups ( zou _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; wu _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . however , for two multi - merger ( group ) candidates in table 1 ( ir02459@xmath240233 and ir12202@xmath271646 ) , neither of them belong to an interacting group since the surrounding galaxies are either foreground or background objects ( zheng _ et al .",
    "considering that the evolutionary sequence from galaxy groups to ulirgs and then to ellipticals is attractive from both theoretical and observational points of view , further detailed multi - wavelength observations on these group candidates have been scheduled .    as for the remaining 12 multiple mergers in borne s classifications , six of them are consistent with our classifications ( ir13539@xmath272920 , ir16007@xmath273743 , ir18580@xmath276527 , ir20100@xmath244156 , ir20253@xmath243757and ir23515@xmath242421 ) .",
    "we carefully examined the six discrepant targets , of which five of them contain only one or two clumps brighter than @xmath49 in the _ i_-band .",
    "therefore they are classified as single or double nucleus / nuclei ulirgs .",
    "the case for ir14337@xmath244134 is somewhat confusing .",
    "this target seems to reside in a group composed of several bright galaxies as well as star - like objects , of which the biggest galaxy indeed contains three obvious nuclei .",
    "however , the star - like object located in the center is the nearest target to the iras position .",
    "in addition , the qdot redshift survey ( lawrence _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) reveals that its optical spectral type is seyfert  1 and the calculation of far - infrared luminosity for ir14337@xmath244134 is also based on the redshift of this seyfert galaxy . considering this , borne _",
    "_ ( 2000 ) may have identified the wrong target on the wfpc2 snapshot image .",
    "putting aside ir14337@xmath244134 , we suggest that the remaining five multiple mergers in borne s identification which are absent from our results are due to different selection criteria involved",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) identified several targets with very complex tidal features to be multiple merger cases with no regard for the exact numbers of their observable nuclei .",
    "although it is likely that a very complex morphology does point to a possible multiple merger origin , we identify multiple mergers simply based on the exact number of clumps brighter than @xmath23mag , because any tight correlation between morphologies and nucleus numbers needs to be verified by further numerical simulations of merging processes .      1 .",
    ": :    from luminosity distributions in sec .",
    "5.2 , it is obvious that putative    nuclei in single nucleus ulirgs tend to be more luminous than those in    multiple / double mergers .",
    "statistical studies on available spectral    information also reveal that there is a seyfert  1/qso excess in the    single nucleus category .",
    "therefore , our results strongly support the    argument of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) that bulge and supermassive    black holes may both grow in galaxy merging . and",

    "peculiar morphologies frequently emerge in    double / multiple nuclei ulirgs , such as long tidal tails and distinct    ring structures .",

    "<S> , there is a high luminosity tail in the luminosity distribution , which corresponds to a seyfert  1/qso excess . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that active galactic nuclei tend to appear at final merging stage . for multiple / double nuclei galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we also find a high fraction of very close nucleus pairs ( e.g. , 3/4 for those separated by less than 5kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this strengthens the conclusion that systems at late merging phase preferentially host ulirgs . </S>"
