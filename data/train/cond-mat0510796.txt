    "it was realized long ago that dislocations play an important role in determining the mechanical properties of a crystal  whether periodic or not . as a consequence ,",
    "ever since the discovery of quasicrystals much effort has been invested in the experimental and the theoretical study of their dislocations  @xcite , leading to interesting observations such as the special role played by phasons in the motion of dislocations .    here",
    "we study the behavior of dislocations in a model system based on the dynamical equation of lifshitz and petrich  ( * ? ? ? * henceforth lp ) , which is a modification of the well - known swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the lp equation is relaxational , @xmath0 , driving a continuous 2-dimensional density field @xmath1 towards a minimum of the lyapunov functional , or `` effective free energy '' , @xmath2 ^ 2    - \\frac13 \\rho^3 + \\frac14 \\rho^4 \\bigr\\},\\ ] ] yielding a dynamical equation of the form @xmath3 among their results , lp showed that if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 and @xmath7 is sufficiently small , stable steady - state patterns are obtained ( from random initial conditions ) with long - range order and square , hexagonal , or dodecagonal symmetry , respectively .",
    "although the lp equation can not describe the dynamics of real solid - state quasicrystals and is probably more appropriate for soft matter or fluid phenomena such as faraday waves , it offers a unique opportunity for the quantitative study of dislocations in a system  exhibiting both periodic and quasiperiodic long - range order  whose dynamics is exactly known .",
    "the lyapunov functional @xmath8 in  ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) is clearly invariant under any translation or rotation of space .",
    "the steady - state solutions that are obtained are symmetry - broken ground states of @xmath9 , whose fourier transform has the form @xmath10 where the ( reciprocal ) lattice @xmath11 is a finitely generated @xmath12-module , _ i.e. _ it can be expressed as the set of all integral linear combination of a finite number @xmath13 of @xmath14-dimensional wave vectors . in the special case where @xmath13 , called the rank of the structure , is equal to the physical dimension @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the structure is periodic .",
    "any particular ground state @xmath16 of @xmath8 is _ indistinguishable _ from a whole set of ground states that are related by so - called gauge transformations @xmath17 where @xmath18 , called a _ gauge - function , _ has the property that @xmath19 , possibly to within an additive integer , whenever @xmath20 and @xmath21 are in @xmath11 .",
    "as described in detail by drger and mermin  @xcite , gauge functions form a vector space @xmath22 of all real - valued linear functions on the lattice @xmath11 . because @xmath11 has rank @xmath13 , any linear function is completely specified by giving its values on @xmath13 integrally - independent lattice vectors .",
    "the space @xmath22 is therefore a @xmath13-dimensional vector space over the real numbers .",
    "the space @xmath22 contains , as a subset , all the integral - valued linear functions on @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "gauge functions in @xmath23 leave the ground - state density invariant .",
    "gauge functions that belong to the quotient space @xmath24 take the ground state described by @xmath25 into a different , yet indistinguishable , ground state described by some other density function @xmath26 .",

    "as we traverse in a loop around the position of the dislocation , say the origin , we locally change the ground state @xmath27 by a gradually varying gauge function which winds around the @xmath28 direction of the @xmath13-torus @xmath29 times , and returns back to the original point .",
    "this is most readily accomplished by using an angle - dependent local gauge function @xmath30 that assigns to the @xmath28 basis vector @xmath31 of @xmath11 the value @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the most general dislocation is characterized by a set of @xmath13 integers ( @xmath33 ) , which for a periodic crystal reduces to the familiar @xmath14-dimensional burgers vector .",
