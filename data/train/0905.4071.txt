    "the prediction and the discovery of stellar mass black holes certainly were a great achievement of the last century . however , it is still unclear if astrophysical black holes can possess a significant electric charge .",
    "the main objection is related to common observation that there is no charge in the standard astrophysical objects like stars and planets .",
    "we know anyway that all these objects have an electric charge which is nonzero . as an example , the sun charge computed following rosseland ( 1924 ) is equivalent to a few hundred of coulombs .",
    "however , from the point of view of relativistic astrophysics , it is insignificant .",
    "there is also a theoretical objection@xcite , related to the fact that a compact object with a net charge greater than @xmath3 , would be rapidly discharged by interaction with the surrounding plasma .",
    "+ the critic remarks , we can address to the two objections , are the following : + 1 ) regarding the observations , we know that it is related to criteria and precision of the experiment . in fact , new space - based missions will be able to measure the position of stars with a precision of @xmath4",
    ". this will be sufficient to scrutinize the possible gravitational lensing and evidence the part due to the charge of the black hole .",
    "+ 2 ) from the theoretical point of view , we know that the reissner - nordstrm metric allows a maximum charge given by : @xmath5 .",
    "we want to stress that the objection@xcite is not a theoretical limit since it depends on the modelization of the local environment and presupposes that this charge is static .",
    "we can not exclude a peculiar situation when we could dynamically form a charged black hole that could evolve after formation to a complete or partial discharge . here",
    "the key assumption is related to a dynamical approach . without this fence of a static charge for an astrophysical object",
    "we can explore how a compact object could acquire a net charge . in this article",
    ", we propose an astrophysical scenario in order to obtain a charged black hole .",
    "our basis is that we have observed numerous compact objects with a high magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) and with high rotation velocity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the aim of this article is to show that there is no reason to believe that the charge of a new - born black hole is negligible .",
    "as it is believed , stellar black holes are born most likely as a result of supernova explosions of massive stars@xcite . at the later stages of evolution",
    "this sort of a star consists of a compact and dense core and an extensive rare envelope .",
    "finally , the core loses stability and collapses into a black hole .",
    "the envelope is erupted out and observed as a supernova phenomenon .    during all the process",
    "the collapsing core is surrounded by some plasma which is a very good conductor .",
    "usually , it is considered as a critical argument that the core and , consequently , the new - born black hole can not have any significant charge .",
    "however , it disregards that the core rotates and possesses a strong magnetic field .",
    "if the resistance of the substance is negligible , the electric field in the comoving frame of reference must be zero . in the static frame of reference the electric field is defined by the lorentz transform : @xmath8}{\\sqrt{1-\\dfrac{\\upsilon^2}{c^2}}}\\label{lifsh1 } \\\\",

    "consequently , the core charge need not be obligatory equal to zero .    in order to estimate the charge of the core we use the following procedure :    1 .   magnetic field calculation around the collapsing core .",
    "determination of the surface velocity and electric field calculation in accordance with ( [ lifsh1 ] ) .",
    "the charge calculation from the maxwell equation @xmath10    we make several assumptions to simplify the solution .",
    "first of all , the core and the substance surrounding the core are supposed to have infinite conductivity ( see substantiating calculations in the _ discussion _ ) .",
    "we presume the gravitational field around the core to be the schwarzschild one and the collapse to be spherically symmetric",
    ". of course , for the rotating core it can not be precisely correct .",
    "however , if the rotation is not very rapid , the deviation from the schwarzschild metric should not be very big .",
    "acceptability of the supposition will be discussed in the _",
    "discussion_. we presume that the magnetic field has only the dipole component during the collapse and the axis of rotation coincides with the axis of the magnetic dipole .",
    "we make also some more assumptions , but they will be mentioned during the solution itself .",
    "hereafter @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the standard schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath15 .",
    "we use the orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath16 the corresponding coframe of differential forms looks like : @xmath17 with this choice of the frame the metric has the lorentz form @xmath18 .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are three - vectors ; their components are given in the spatial orthonormal triad set of basis three - vectors , corresponding to the chart  ( [ frame ] ) .",

    "@xmath25 is a coefficient proportional to the dipole momentum of the system .    in order to obtain the magnetic field around the collapsing core we assume@xcite the collapse to be quasistatic",
    "of course , this supposition is artificial , especially of the last stages of collapse , but it gives us the opportunity to proceed a strict examination of the problem in the framework of general relativity .",
    "if the collapse is quasistatic , the magnetic field around the core is always described by ( [ magn1],[magn2 ] ) but the coefficient @xmath25 is no longer constant@xcite , it depends upon the radius of the collapsing core @xmath12 .",
    "we can deduce the dependence from infinite conductivity of the star and continuity of the normal component of the magnetic field on the surface of the core . in our case",
    "it can be written in the form ( see ref .  ,",
    "equation(24 ) for more details ) : @xmath26 .",
    "since the collapse is radial , @xmath13 coordinate of a surface element considered remains constant during it and , consequently , ( @xmath27 ) and ( @xmath28 ) are also constant .",
    "we define a new quantity @xmath29 which thus remains constant during the collapse ( in contrast to @xmath25 ) . it should be derived from the initial conditions .",
    "we obtain from ( [ magn1 ] ) : @xmath30= d\\\\ & a = d\\left [ -\\dfrac{r^2}{r^2_g}\\ln\\left(1- \\dfrac{r_g}{r}\\right)-\\dfrac{r}{r_g } -\\dfrac12 \\right]^{-1 } \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this @xmath25 into ( [ magn1 ] ) and ( [ magn2 ] ) , we get the formulas describing the magnetic field around the collapsing core :    @xmath31      tangential velocity of a particle falling on a black hole is defined by the angular momentum conservation condition@xcite . for a non - relativistic particle falling in the equatorial plane with small angular momentum @xmath32",
    "we have : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "since the angular momentum of the collapsing core also remains constant , by analogy we can suggest the tangential velocity of the surface to be @xmath35 here @xmath36 provides solid body rotation of the surface , and @xmath37 is as before a constant which should be derived from the initial conditions .    in order to calculate electric field intensity",
    ", we should make some assumptions about the substance surrounding the collapsing core .",
    "it is most likely hot but respectively rare plasma .",
    "as it was already mentioned , we consider it as a perfect conductor .",
    "since the magnetic field of the core is very strong at the late stages of the collapse , we can expect that the plasma is frozen to the magnetic field and corotates .",
    "consequently , its tangential velocity @xmath38 ( just around the surface of the core ) is equal to ( [ tangen ] ) .",
    "the question of @xmath39 and @xmath40 components of the plasma velocity is not so clear .",
    "we speculate that they are equal to zero . properly speaking ,",
    "in the nonrelativistic case they can not make a contribution to the electric field flux ( since @xmath41 ) , but if they are relativistic , they contributes to the @xmath42 in ( [ lifsh1 ] ) .",
    "hence , in our case the supposition @xmath43 , @xmath44 means only that the velocities are much less than the speed of light .",
    "finally , for the substance velocity we have : @xmath45    since we presume the rotation of the core to be slow , the ratio @xmath46 is small and @xmath47 ; in any case near the gravitational radius @xmath48 . we can therefore use ( [ lifsh2 ] ) to calculate the electric field . combining ( [ magth ] ) and ( [ velocity ] )",
    ", we obtain for the electric field just above the core surface : @xmath49 integrating it over the sphere surrounding the core and using equation ( [ maxwell ] ) , we obtain for the charge : @xmath50 the charge is positive if the angular velocity of the core and its magnetic moment are codirectional .",
    "the charge described by ( [ charge ] ) , reaches its maximum at @xmath51 and drops to zero as @xmath52 when @xmath12 tends to @xmath53 .",
    "seemingly , it should mean that the charge of the formed black hole is zero .",
    "however , we have not yet taken into account gravitational force and its influence on the discharge processes .",
    "let us consider a resting probe particle of mass @xmath54 and charge @xmath55 ( let us denote its specific charge by @xmath56 ) .",
    "electric field acting on the particle consists of several components : electric field ( [ lifsh1 ] ) produced by the plasma rotation in the magnetic field and electrostatic field created by the excess of nonequilibrium charge ( with respect to ( [ charge ] ) ) which has not discharged .",
    "magnetic field impedes the discharge ( equilibrium quantity of charge , described by ( [ charge ] ) , is always nonzero ) .",
    "however , since the equilibrium charge approaches zero when @xmath57 , we can ignore for simplicity the influence of the magnetic field at the last stages of the collapse .",
    "the electrostatic force acting on the probe particle can be taken as : @xmath58 gravitational force acting on the particle is@xcite : @xmath59 both the forces directed radially . the discharge ( by particles with specific charge @xmath56 )",
    "will be stopped by the gravitational field , when @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 the last equation represents the charge which can be held by the gravitational field .",

    "the equilibrium charge described by ( [ charge ] ) is represented by the solid line .",
    "the graphs have the only crossing point .",
    "when it is reached , the discharge is stopped by the gravitational field .",
    "consequently , we can take the charge of the collapsar at this point as an estimation of the charge of new - born black hole .",
    "we equate expressions ( [ charge ] ) and ( [ gcharge ] ) : @xmath62 introducing a new dimensionless constant @xmath63 we finally obtain : @xmath64 in order to find the charge we should solve this equation and substitute the obtained radius @xmath12 into ( [ gcharge ] ) or ( [ charge ] ) . if @xmath65 is very small ( @xmath66 ) , then @xmath67 , and the equation can be simplified : @xmath68",
    "let us estimate the electric charge of a real new - born black hole .",
    "we have already mentioned that a sun mass black hole is born by the collapse of a massive star central part .",
    "as it is believed , neutron stars are also born as a consequence of massive star core collapses , but of lower masses .",
    "consequently , the characteristic physical parameters of the core can be estimated from the parameters of neutron stars .",
    "the radius of a neutron star is @xmath69  km , the mass is @xmath70 .",
    "pulsars have the magnetic field @xmath71  gs , the shortest known period of revolution@xcite of a pulsar is @xmath72  ms .",
    "we take the mass of the collapsing core @xmath73 ( @xmath74  cm ) .",
    "it is heavier than a neutron star to form a black hole .",
    "hence , we should consider its physical parameter when its radius is bigger .",
    "using the above - mentioned analogy , we presume that when the radius of the collapsing core is @xmath75  km its period of revolution is @xmath76  s and the magnetic field intensity on its pole is @xmath77  gs . as the specific charge @xmath56",
    "we take the specific charge of electron ( or positron ) . if the charge @xmath78 is negative ( the angular velocity of the core and its magnetic moment are oppositely directed ) , it is obvious .",
    "but even in the case when the charge of the core is positive , the temperature at the last stages of the collapse is so high that the positron concentration is sufficient to provide the discharge . from this",
    "we calculate @xmath37,@xmath79 and @xmath65 .",
    "the formula for the period of revolution coincides with the classical one : @xmath80 .",
    "subtracting @xmath38 from ( [ velocity ] ) , we finally find @xmath81  km .",
    "we find @xmath82 .",
    "as soon as @xmath83 we can use ( [ mainsimple ] ) . solving the equation , we have : @xmath84 the maximum charge of the core is reached ( in accordance with ( [ charge ] ) ) , when the radius is @xmath51 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath85  coulombs , thirty times higher than the final one .",
    "the foregoing calculations may provoke several objections .",
    "first of all , the radius ( [ rad ] ) , where the discharge is stopped by the gravitational field , is too close to the schwarzschild sphere .",
    "the disturbance of the sphere produced by the core rotation is much stronger , and the adduced solution is certainly not valid for this region .",
    "moreover , we used a lot of strong simplifying suppositions , such as the calculation of the magnetic field on the assumption of quasistatic collapse .",
    "these remarks are correct , but they do not affect significantly the conclusions of the article .",
    "the purpose of the work was to show that a new - born black hole can possess a big electric charge .",
    "the charge of the core surpasses @xmath86  c since the radius of the collapsing core becomes less than @xmath87 , where the departure of the metric from the schwarzschild one is not so significant .",
    "moreover , the final charge depends weakly on the parameter ( [ rad ] ) and , consequently , on the details of the discharge processes .",
    "of course , the estimation ( [ q ] ) can be inaccurate , but nevertheless we have strong reasons to presume the final charge to be bigger than @xmath77  c.    initially , the star is not electrically charged .",
    "as we have shown , because of the magnetodynamical processes a charge separation appears",
    ". then what happens with the charge separated from the forming black hole ?",
    "of course , it is emitted to the substance of the envelope ; a further destiny of the charge depends on the envelope evolution .",
    "the collapse of a core of a massive star is considered numerically in ref .  .",
    "it is shown that the differential rotation of the envelope appears resulting in the magnetic field generation . at some moment",
    "magnetohydrodynamical instability arises ; it leads to the twisting of the magnetic lines and closed magnetic vortex generation .",
    "the magnetic field structure becomes very complex .",
    "finally , magnetic pressure increases so that it ejects the envelope to the outer space producing a supernova explosion .",
    "the charge evolved from the core moves along the magnetic lines and is trapped by the forming vortexes . during the supernova explosion the envelope substance",
    "is erupted out together with the charge frozen in the magnetic vortexes .    in the _ model description",
    "_ we presumed that the core and the substance surrounding the core have infinitive conductivity .",
    "this statement can be proved numerically .",
    "conductivity of the totally ionized plasma depends only on its temperature and does not depend on the density@xcite : @xmath88\\nonumber\\ ] ] let us consider a sphere of the radius of @xmath75  km ( characteristic for the collapsing core ) and with electric charge @xmath89  c merged into the plasma with the temperature @xmath90  k. then electric field intensity around the sphere is @xmath91  @xmath92 , current density is @xmath93 , and the total current is @xmath94 .",
    "the sphere would be discharged in @xmath95  s. of course , this time has not a direct physical meaning , but this proves the negligibility of the electrical resistance in the considered task .",
    "it is important to notice that though the obtained charge of an astrophysical black hole is big , the charge to mass ratio is small @xmath96 , and it is not sufficient to affect significantly either the gravitational field of the star or the dynamics of its collapse .",
    "the numerical collapse of a charged star in the reissner - nordstrm space - time was computed@xcite .",
    "they considered spherical symmetry with distribution of an electric charge proportional to the distribution of mass .",
    "for the numerical computation they assumed a polytropic equation of state with @xmath97 .",
    "they concluded that for low values of @xmath98 no departure from unpolarized collapse was found . in our case @xmath99 , which satisfies the criteria@xcite , and it also justifies our approach of using a schwarzschild metric .",
    "in the article , we considered a collapsing core with a moderate magnetic field .",
    "the electric charge of the new - born black hole turns to be sizable , but its electrostatic field ( @xmath100  gs ) is lower than the critical one ( @xmath101  gs ) .",
    "however , in the case of magnetars , the magnetic field of the collapsing core can also be extremely strong ( @xmath102  gs ) .",
    "then the charge of the black hole can be so big that the electric field will surpass the critical . in this case a new effect appears@xcite : a very large number of @xmath103 pairs is created in the region with overcritical electric field , which finally leads to the formation of a strong gamma - ray burst .",
    "interaction of the accreting substance with the energetic @xmath104-ray emission of a black hole can also induce an electric charge into it@xcite .",
    "the compton scattering of @xmath104-photons kicks out electrons from the accretion flow , while for the protons this mechanism is not so effective because of higher mass - charge ratio . as a result ,",
    "the black hole should obtain a significant charge .",
    "however , one can see@xcite that in the system considered the charge induced by this process is approximately 100 times lower than ( [ q ] ) .",
    "actually , in our case the mechanism is not effective .    in ref .",
    ", processes in the force - free magnetosphere of an already formed black hole are considered .",
    "as it was shown , because of accretion the black hole acquires a significant electric charge : @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the magnetic field intensity in the accreting substance near the black hole .",
    "this quantity is big and quite correlates with ( [ q ] ) .",
    "thus , an astrophysical black hole can possess a big electric charge , either getting it during the birth or owing to the accretion .",
