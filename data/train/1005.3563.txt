    "fermions on graphene s honeycomb lattice can in principle find themselves in a plethora of insulating phases , depending on the relative magnitudes of different components of a finite - range repulsive interaction , for example @xcite .",
    "if the net interaction would have an attractive component , on the other hand , there would be a variety of superconducting states available to dirac quasiparticles for pairing and condensation .",
    "some of them are quite conventional : the on - site attraction would clearly favor the usual s - wave singlet pairing @xcite .",
    "others are already less so ; the second - nearest - neighbor attraction , for example , leads to an f - wave superconductor @xcite , which changes sign six times around the brillouin zone .",
    "another exotic superconducting state on honeycomb lattice was argued to arise from the nearest - neighbor attraction @xcite : instead of gapping the dirac points it lowers the energy of the dirac - fermi sea by effectively increasing the fermi velocity . only away from half - filling",
    "does this state acquire a finite superconducting gap , which is then proportional to the chemical potential .",
    "a closely related superconducting ground state was also discussed in the context of the t - j - u model and graphite @xcite .",
    "hidden _ superconducting order is otherwise a spin - singlet , and even under the exchange of the two sublattices and/or the dirac points .",
    "since the electrons in graphene have three sets of discrete indices , the sublattice , valley , and real spin , possible superconducting states may exhibit various symmetries with respect to spatial and time inversions @xcite . together with the observation of superconductivity in graphite @xcite , the intricate structure of the superconducting vortex @xcite , novel proximity phenomena @xcite and the quantum criticality @xcite , this makes the problem of superconductivity in graphene or in an optical honeycomb lattice engaging from theoretical as well as experimental points of view .    in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the forms of the superconducting condensate on the honeycomb lattice at , and therefore also near , half - filling . as a convenient point of departure",
    "we consider the problem of graphene with the chemical potential right at the dirac point and with the attraction only between the electrons residing on the nearest neighbors of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the motivation for studying such a pairing interaction of a finite range comes in part from the theories of boson - fermion mixtures in optical lattices , where the nearest - neighbor attraction between fermions arises upon integration over the bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite . also , since the fermions in reality certainly experience a strong repulsion when they find themselves on the same site , the attraction between the nearest neighbors appears to be the simplest reasonable assumption that would still lead to pairing .",
    "our conclusion about the superconducting ground state that arises as the bcs mean - field solution in this model is unusual and qualitatively different from the previous study @xcite . within the standard mean - field approach",
    "we find the superconducting state with the lowest energy to be the spin - triplet , _ non - uniform _ condensate , which is odd under the exchange of the two sublattices .",
    "the spatial kekule pattern @xcite of bonds between the paired electrons on nearest - neighbors has the periodicity of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the dirac points , which allows it to connect the two dirac valleys and that way open the mass - gap in the bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "it is an example of fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinikov @xcite type of superconducting phase appropriate to the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we argue that the development of such a non - uniform superconductor at t=0 may preempt the formation of the previously proposed hidden order , which in our approximation we indeed find to be suppressed at all couplings .",
    "the kekule superconductor breaks the exact particle - number and the spin - rotational symmetries , and exhibits three massless and three massive modes in the ordered phase .",
    "it also rather weakly breaks the internal and approximate @xmath2 symmetry between various kekule patterns . near the semimetal - superconductor transition we find the p - kekule state , odd under the valley exchange , to have the lowest energy , with an additional discontinuous transition _ within _ the superconducting phase into the s - kekule state , even under the valley exchange , at a stronger attractive interaction .",
    "the target space of the kekule order parameter is @xmath3 , the surface of sphere in four dimensions .",
    "the topology of this space implies that there are no stable topological defects in our two - dimensional system , and therefore presumably no sharp finite temperature phase transition .",
    "explicit breaking of the rotational symmetry , by an external magnetic field or the spin - orbit interaction , for instance , changes the target space for the order parameter and restores the possibility of topologically distinct defects .",
    "the cases of easy plane and easy axis , introduced by the two terms mentioned above , are both discussed .",
    "we also list all other gapped and hidden ( gapless ) superconducting states on the honeycomb lattice , and briefly comment on their competition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we write the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian in the dirac form , and introduce the non - uniform kekule ansatz for the superconducting bond order parameters .",
    "the minimization of the mean - field energy for the simplest non - uniform state and the resulting s - kekule superconductor is presented in section iii . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the competition between the kekule and hidden orders . in sec . v a more general kekule pattern",
    "is considered , and the p - kekule state is defined .",
    "the other possible superconducting orders are discussed in sec .",
    "vi , and the issue of topological defects and the target space for the kekule order parameter in sec .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "consider the usual tight - binding hamiltonian for spin-1/2 fermions on honeycomb lattice at half - filling , with an attractive interaction between the nearest neighbors , @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the fermionic operators at the two triangular sublattices of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "decoupling the interaction term in the particle - particle channel yields the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian @xmath9 with the superconducting order parameters to be determined self - consistently as @xmath10    assuming the order parameters to be much smaller than the bandwidth the condensation energy comes mainly from the pairing of the quasiparticle states near the two dirac points .",
    "let us form a 16-component dirac - nambu fermion @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xmath15 the tight - binding hamiltonian at low energies then becomes @xmath16 with @xmath17 as the dirac hamiltonian in two dimensions , which in our construction and in the first quantization assumes a particularly simple form , @xmath18 here , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , are the usual four - component anticommuting hermitian gamma - matrices @xcite .",
    "the two - component pauli matrices @xmath22 operate on nambu s , and @xmath23 on the spin indices .",
    "we will also define the remaining two gamma - matrices as @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . for convenience , hereafter we also set the fermi velocity @xmath26 and the lattice spacing @xmath27 to unity .",
    "next , we define the _ kekule ansatz _ for the superconducting order parameter : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 the components of the triplet are assumed to be spatially periodic , with the periodicity of @xmath0 , whereas the singlet component is simply uniform .",
    "the  angle \" @xmath31 parameterizes different spatial patterns of the order parameter .",
    "the unit cell of the kekule lattice is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "we determine first the optimal kekule ground state for @xmath32 , and then consider a more general solution . with the above ansatz",
    "the bdg hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath33 where the two matrices appearing in the last term are @xmath34 \\tau_1 + i m [ \\delta ' ] \\tau_2 ) \\otimes \\sigma_0 \\otimes i \\gamma_0 \\gamma_3 ) h_d,\\ ] ] and    @xmath35 \\otimes \\gamma_0 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38    before proceeding with the diagonalization of the bdg hamiltonian it is worth pausing to register its symmetries .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian commutes with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which in our representation stand for the particle - number operator and the generator of translations .",
    "it also commutes with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , when accompanied with the axis inversions @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the latter two operations represent the exchanges of the two dirac - points and the two sublattices , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 also commutes with all three generators of rotations of electron spin , @xmath45 .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 does not commute with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , but , for @xmath32 under consideration at the moment , it does commute with @xmath50 .",
    "it therefore represents a spatially _ non - uniform _ superconducting condensate , which is odd under the sublattice exchange and even under the exchange of dirac points",
    ". we will call it the _ s - kekule superconductor_. since it violates the spin - rotational symmetry , the matrix @xmath46 represents a triplet superconducting state , which breaks two generators of spin rotations .",
    "the matrix @xmath51 , on the other hand , is a product of the dirac hamiltonian and another matrix which , in our representation , by itself would represent the singlet s - wave order parameter @xcite . since the two factors anticommute the presence of the imaginary unit in eq . ( 13 ) makes the matrix @xmath51 hermitian .",
    "the matrix @xmath51 represents the hidden superconducting order @xcite .",
    "this superconducting state , however , suffers from an energetic disadvantage : since @xmath51 vanishes precisely at the dirac points , opening of the order parameter @xmath52 seems like an ineffective way to lower the energy of the filled dirac - fermi sea .",
    "we will argue shortly that in competition with the kekule triplet the hidden order is likely to be energetically inferior .",
    "therefore we set @xmath53 for the time being , to return to the issue of the hidden superconducting order only after we determine the optimal triplet s - kekule order parameters .    setting then @xmath54 one finds @xmath55 where the vector @xmath56 has the components : @xmath57 and the mass - gap is @xmath58 the mean - field ground state energy per site of honeycomb lattice is therefore @xmath59 where @xmath47 is the number of points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "we also assume an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath60 in the integral over momenta , which is here performed only near the two dirac points . differentiating with respect",
    "to @xmath61 immediately shows that for any value of the mass @xmath62 the minimum of energy lies at @xmath63 .",
    "we set therefore @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "viewed as a set of two linear equations for the variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 they will have a non - trivial solution only if @xmath68 which also happens to be the remaining equation @xmath69 .",
    "the trivial solution @xmath70 will be discussed separately in sec .",
    "the condition @xmath63 yields therefore only two , and not three independent equations .",
    "the last equation then implies @xmath71 and the remaining condition constrains the order parameter s phases as @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "finally , the minimum of energy is at the value of the mass - gap @xmath75 determined by the gap equation : @xmath76 which has a solution for @xmath77 . at the minimum , after some straightforward algebra the matrix @xmath46 can be written as :    @xmath78 \\otimes \\gamma_0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . at the minimum of the energy the kekule state has three hard and three soft modes : the angles @xmath81 determine the preferred spin axis for the triplet state , and @xmath82 is the superconducting phase .",
    "note that the condition for the energy minimum @xmath63 eliminated three out of six linearly independent matrices that appear in the matrix @xmath46 in eq .",
    ". the remaining three matrices anticommute among themselves as well as with the dirac hamiltonian and therefore enter as a sum of squares into the expression of the ground state energy .",
    "this quite generally appears to be the optimal way for the filled dirac - fermi sea to lower its energy .",
    "another example of this rule is the emergence of the easy plane for the nel order parameter for the antiferromagnetic state on the honeycomb lattice in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "further consequences of this rule for the form of the order parameter in the presence of the terms that break rotational symmetry will be discussed in sec .",
    "let us now restore the possibility of the hidden superconducting order , while retaining the energy - minimum condition @xmath83 .",
    "the mean - field energy per site is now modified into : @xmath84 ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in writing this expression we assumed the relative phase between the hidden and the kekule order parameters to be @xmath85 , so that the matrices @xmath51 in eq . ( 13 ) and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( 26 ) anticommute and enter the energy expression as a sum of squares .",
    "the relative factor of two in the first term derives from the sum of order parameters over a kekule unit cell ( fig .",
    "the critical interaction for the appearance of the s - kekule order is therefore @xmath86 , whereas for the hidden order , in absence of the kekule state , _ it would be _ @xmath87 . choosing the cutoff @xmath60 even as big as unity , which , for instance , would represent the interval of the energies over which the tight - binding density of states is approximately linear , we see that by increasing the interaction at @xmath88 the system first becomes the kekule superconductor , with @xmath89 . upon further increase of the interaction the amplitude of",
    "the order parameter @xmath90 grows , and then suppresses any appearance of the hidden order .",
    "we believe the reason for this outcome of the competition to be quite physical : given the choice whether to open the gap in spectrum or increase the velocity of excitations , all the rest being equal , the system chooses the former option as energetically preferable . the reader should be warned , however , that this conclusion could in principle be overturned upon inclusion of the states farther from the fermi level into the energy calculation . the pure hidden order , or even the coexistence of the two orders , seem conceivable as well .",
    "since the presence of the residual repulsive interactions in a real system will always broaden the single - particle states away from the fermi level , it is difficult to say anything more definite on this issue beyond the low - energy approximation we employed .",
    "we have checked , nevertheless , that our conclusion remains unaltered within the present mean - field calculation that keeps _ all _ quasiparticle states perfectly sharp , upon inclusion of the states from the entire first brillouin zone . this way we find the two critical interactions defined above to be @xmath91 and @xmath92 , in qualitative agreement with the conclusion based on the linear approximation to quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "for further details of this computation the reader should consult the appendix .",
    "we turn to a general kekule state with the parameter @xmath93 next .",
    "select the spin axis so that @xmath94 by setting the angle @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( 26 ) . without a loss in generality one may choose then the order parameter @xmath96 to be real , and write the bdg hamiltonian _ in real space _ as @xmath97 \\phi(\\vec{x}_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 belong to the same sublattice , and",
    "@xmath100 @xmath101 is one of the three vectors that connect the nearest neighbors of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the elements of the connectivity matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 represent the uniform and kekule hopping integrals between the nearest - neighbors , respectively . by rotating @xmath104 in the second term into @xmath105 then , we find that the energy of the dirac - fermi sea in presence of a superconducting kekule order parameter @xmath103 is given by the sum of the energies of the _ two _ copies of the dirac - fermi seas for the spinless fermions : one in presence of the kekule hopping pattern @xmath106 , and the other in the pattern @xmath107 . we have therefore computed the energy @xmath108 for the single copy as a function of the parameter @xmath31 at various values of the amplitude @xmath109 .",
    "the typical result is depicted in fig .",
    "2 . the function @xmath108 may be shown in general to be even , and periodic with the period @xmath110 , which reflects the rotational symmetry of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the computation shows that its absolute minimum is always at @xmath32 , in agreement with the recent work @xcite , and the maximum at @xmath111 .",
    "we then find that @xmath112 , as long as @xmath113 .",
    "the transition from the semimetallic phase is therefore into the superconducting kekule phase with @xmath114 , which we therefore name _ p - kekule_. for @xmath115 , deep within the superconducting phase , we find @xmath32 solution to eventually become energetically favorable , with a discontinuous transition between the s - kekule and p - kekule superconductors .",
    "let us also recognize the other gapped superconducting states , as the possible mass - terms that anticommute _ both _ with the dirac hamiltonian @xmath17 and with the number operator @xmath47 :    \\a ) the standard s - wave superconductor with the on - site pairing , @xmath116   \\psi \\rangle,\\ ] ] which is translationally invariant , even under the valley and/or sublattice exchange , but odd under the exchange of spin labels ( spin singlet ) .",

    "( 4 ) . since the hermitian matrix @xmath120 by construction then anticommutes with the dirac hamiltonian @xmath17 while at the same time being proportional to it , its addition to @xmath17 will effectively only renormalize the velocity of the bogoliubov excitations , as manifest in eq . ( 27 ) .",
    "of course , one can imagine many other matrices that do not commute with the number operator , and will therefore represent some superconducting order , which nevertheless do not fall into any of the categories listed above .",
    "these fail to anticommute with the dirac hamiltonian , and as such neither gap out , nor increase the velocity of the dirac fermions .",
    "development of these order parameters would not therefore be particularly energetically advantageous , which is the reason behind their omission here .",
    "one can expect the gapped superconducting states to compete in the phase diagram for attractive interactions in a close parallel with the competition between insulators when the interactions are repulsive @xcite . as an illustration , in fig .",
    "3 we present the mean - field phase diagram in presence of both the on - site and the nearest - neighbor attractions at half filling . in analogy with the insulating case , there is a discontinuous transition between the ordered phases , whereas the transitions out of the semimetallic phase may be expected to be continuous @xcite .",
    "one novel feature is that because of the @xmath2 symmetry in the superconducting phase the matrices representing different superconducting states can be chosen so as to _ anticommute_. consider the above p - kekule state with the phase @xmath121 and the spin axis along z - direction , for example .",
    "choosing the uniform s - wave state with @xmath122 makes the two representative mass - matrices anticommuting , so that right at the boundary between the two phases the system acquires a larger symmetry @xmath123 . adding the third axis for the second - nearest neighbor attractive interaction introduces then a region of the f - wave order , with the discontinuous transitions between any two of the three phases .",
    "interestingly , there is a unique anticommuting f - wave state , with @xmath122 and with the spin axis along z - direction , that may be added to the above combination of the already anticommuting kekule and s - wave order parameters . at the point in the phase diagram where the three phases would meet , an even larger , @xmath124",
    ", symmetry emerges .",
    "if the preferred non - uniform superconducting state is the s - kekule , on the other hand , the possible anticommuting states are again the uniform s - wave and f - wave condensates , but this time both with the same phase as the one of the s - kekule state .",
    "in the ordered phase , the mass - matrix for the kekule order parameter in eq . ( 26 ) lives on the @xmath125 target space , but with opposite points identified . in other words , the order parameter space is the product of @xmath126 for the spin direction and half of @xmath127 for the superconducting phase , which is equivalent to @xmath3 , the sphere in four dimensions . that this is",
    "indeed the target space becomes clear upon recalling that the minimum with @xmath83 , the mean - field free energy in eq .",
    "( 21 ) depends only on the mass @xmath128 , where the two complex order parameters @xmath96 and @xmath129 are constrained only by the condition that @xmath62 is the solution of the gap equation .    since the first and the second homotopy groups of @xmath3 are trivial , @xmath130 , there are no stable topological defects , and the massless fluctuations in the ordered phase",
    "should be correctly described by the @xmath131 non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not expect a true finite temperature phase transition from a semimetal into the kekule superconductor , but only a crossover when the superconducting correlation length @xmath132 , with @xmath133 as a ( non - universal ) numerical constant , reaches the size of the sample @xcite .",
    "a reduction of the rotational symmetry would change the target space and allow stable vortex excitations .",
    "let us consider the case of a possible easy plane first .",
    "such an anisotropy may be introduced most simply by placing the kekule superconductor into a magnetic field .",
    "the zeeman term representing the coupling of the magnetic field to the electron spin will be proportional to the generator of rotations along the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath134 , for example . since this matrix commutes with the dirac hamiltonian and with the third term in the kekule mass - matrix @xmath46 in eq . (",
    "14 ) that is proportional to @xmath96 , while it anticommutes with the two other terms in @xmath46 that are proportional to @xmath135 , the minimization of the energy in the presence of zeeman coupling is formally equivalent to the problem of nel ordering in graphene catalyzed by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the result is that @xmath136 , since that way the kekule mass matrix anticommutes with the zeeman term . the way to understand this physically is to realize that in such a state the spins of paired electrons are all orthogonal to the magnetic field , so it becomes easier for them to tilt and provide a finite magnetization in the field direction .",
    "the minimum condition @xmath83 then translates into @xmath137 , the same as without the magnetic field , but without a further constraint on the phases of the two complex order parameters . the s - kekule mass - matrix in eq .",
    "( 14 ) for such an easy plane may be then rewritten differently as    @xmath138    the target space with the easy plane anisotropy is thus @xmath139 , with the factors corresponding to the two phases @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "since the first homotopy group of @xmath127 is non - trivial , @xmath142 , there are different types of topologically distinct vortex excitations .",
    "for example , winding just one of the phases by @xmath143 causes both @xmath144 and @xmath145 to change from zero to @xmath146 , i. e. both the first , phase term , and the second , spin - axis term in the above matrix make half a circle .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as  half - vortex \" @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "winding both the phases @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the same sense by @xmath143 leaves the angle of the spin - axis intact , and produces the standard full vortex in the superconducting phase . finally , winding the two phases @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the opposite sense by @xmath143 produces a third type of vortex , this time in the direction of the spin - axis only .",
    "an easy axis , on the other hand , is introduced by the spin - orbit coupling , for example .",
    "consider adding a weak perturbation to the dirac hamiltonian proportional to @xmath147 , which in our representation corresponds to the third component of the spin - triplet version of the time - reversal symmetry breaking mass , introduced by haldane @xcite and discussed in the context of spin - orbit interaction in graphene by kane and mele @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a term would again select the piece of the kekule mass matrix that anticommutes with it , but due to the @xmath105 matrix in the first , nambu s factor , this now implies that @xmath148 .",
    "the s - kekule matrix assumes the form as in eq .",
    "( 26 ) , with @xmath149 .",
    "the target space therefore in this case reduces to the usual @xmath150 , with only the standard vortices as the topological excitations .",
    "the internal structure of such a vortex has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , it should be understood that we discussed the breaking of the rotational symmetry in the s - kekule state for simplicity only , and that everything said applies equally to the p - kekule state as well .",
    "to summarize , we introduced the non - uniform superconducting state on graphene s honeycomb lattice , and argued that it is the mean - field solution of the simple model with nearest - neighbor attraction .",
    "the order parameter for this state lives on the bonds of the lattice , and forms the kekule lattice with the period three .",
    "competition between different such kekule superconducting states , as well as between the kekule and the other possible gapped and gapless superconducting states was discussed .",
    "the kekule superconductor has a spin - triplet order parameter , which lives on the surface of the @xmath3 sphere .",
    "target spaces for the order parameter and the topological defects in presence of some simple symmetry breaking terms were determined .",
    "a kekule insulator which breaks the translational invariance of the honeycomb lattice has been previously proposed and discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that this state is not the ground state of the simplest model with only the nearest - neighbor repulsion , since there is an energetically superior charge - density - wave that breaks the sublattice exchange symmetry available .",
    "this should be contrasted with the situation for the attractive interactions considered here , where the competing superconducting state is the gapless superconductor , which we argued should have a higher energy .",
    "it was argued recently , however , that the kekule insulator does become the mean - field ground state when there is a balance between the nearest - neighbor and the second - nearest - neighbor components of the repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "we described here only the problem at half - filling in detail , where a finite interaction is needed to cause the superconducting transition . at a finite chemical potential",
    "the density of states at the fermi level also becomes finite , and there is the usual bcs instability at an infinitesimal attraction . for small deviations from the half - filling ,",
    "however , the symmetry of the superconducting state is essentially determined by the solution at the dirac point .",
    "for the nearest - neighbor attraction as the dominant component of the interaction one should therefore expect the non - uniform kekule state we discussed to persist at a finite doping as well .",
    "as long as the fermi surface around the dirac points stays circular @xcite the states with the momenta @xmath151 and @xmath152 may both be near the fermi surface and be paired up by the kekule order parameter with the momentum @xmath0 , essentially the same way as right at half - filling .",

    "<S> a spatially non - uniform superconducting phase is proposed as the electronic variational ground state for the attractive interactions between nearest neighbors on graphene s honeycomb lattice , close to and right at the filling one half . </S>",
    "<S> the state spontaneously breaks the translational invariance of the lattice into the kekule pattern of bond order parameters , and it is gapped , spin triplet , and odd under the sublattice exchange . with the increase of attractive interactions </S>",
    "<S> we first find the transition from the semimetallic phase into the p - kekule superconductor , defined as being odd under the exchange of dirac points , with the additional discontinuous superconductor - superconductor transition into the even s - kekule state , deep within the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> topological excitations of the kekule superconductor and its competition with other superconducting states on the honeycomb lattice are discussed . </S>"
