    "the higgs sector in the standard model is a linear sigma model .",

    "winding configurations shrink to some small size and then unwind via a higgs zero when allowed to evolve by the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "these winding configurations can be stabilized if one introduces four - derivative higgs self - interaction terms which are not present in the standard model @xcite .",
    "the motivation typically cited for introducing such terms is that one may treat the higgs sector of the lagrangian as an effective field theory of some more fundamental theory which only manifests itself explicitly at some high energy scale .",
    "the stabilized configurations have phenomenological consequences in electroweak processes and provide an arena for testing nonperturbative aspects of field theory and the standard model .",
    "the presence of gauge fields leads to the instability of these solitons @xcite , and their decay , whether induced or by quantum tunnelling , is associated with fermion number violation @xcite . in turn , such a mechanism for fermion number violation may have an effect on the early universe and electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the procedure just described for stabilization is inconsistent .",
    "first , treating the higgs sector as an effective theory requires the inclusion of all higher - derivative terms of a given dimension rather than just a few .",
    "moreover , using an effective field theory to stabilize solitons creates difficulties .",
    "effective field theories are equivalent to derivative expansions",
    ". solitons that are stabilized by introducing the leading - order terms in a derivative expansion imply that the following orders in the expansion will contribute equally as the leading orders . truncating the derivative expansion",
    ", then , is not legitimate .",
    "we will take a different approach ; we wish to see whether just the quantum fluctuations of a _ renormalizable",
    "_ @xmath7-higgs theory can stabilize winding configurations .",
    "we will take the higgs sector to be that found in the standard model .",
    "consider just the mode associated with the size of a given winding configuration .",
    "that mode may be parametrized by the quantity @xmath9 , the spatial size of the object ( which must be positive ) .",
    "the potential for that degree of freedom goes like @xmath10 and energetically favors configurations of zero size .",
    "classically , the degree of freedom will evolve towards @xmath11 while losing its energy to radiative modes .",
    "now let us quantize this mode . even though the system would favor being at @xmath12",
    ", that would also imply the momentum conjugate to that degree of freedom would also be zero .",
    "heisenberg uncertainty would puff out the expectation value of the size degree of freedom .",
    "note that the size of the soliton will be proportional to planck s constant to some power .",
    "the mechanism described is analagous to that which stabilizes the atom , which is classically unstable .",
    "of course , there are other modes that couple into our situation , making the analysis more complex .",
    "work has been done @xcite that investigates quantizing breathing modes in sigma models such as the higgs sector of the standard model .    in this paper , we identify the quantum effects on the energy of static winding configurations by evaluating the effective action .",
    "if quantum effects stabilize solitons , that effect should be reflected by some extremum in the effective action .",
    "if we take the weak gauge - coupling limit , @xmath13 , we shall see that an analytic expression is available for the effective action that is a controlled approximation in the regime where we have confidence in @xmath7-higgs theory as a renormalizable field theory .",
    "the weak coupling limit is equivalent to the semiclassical limit when fields are scaled properly . when planck s constant is small , we need only focus on small field configurations .",
    "this observation follows from the scenario described above for stabilizing winding configurations by quantum fluctuations : the size of a stabilized object will be proportional to planck s constant , and therefore , will be small if it exists .",
    "evaluating corrections to energies via the effective action is not a new approach .",
    "it has been a focus of investigation in effective meson theories @xcite and other areas @xcite .",
    "although , they elucidate important effects , such as bosonic and fermionic back - reaction as well as valence fermion effects , these studies treat the effective action to one - loop order only .",
    "we will see that there is a difficulty with simultaneously examining small configurations and neglecting higher - loop effects .",
    "we begin by spelling out the action and types of configurations under consideration .",
    "when configuration sizes are small , we can employ renormalization - group techniques to ascertain the asymptotic behavior of the one - particle irreducible green s functions which , in turn , allows us to determine the leading - order size dependence of the effective action",
    ". we will find our results to be reliable until the size of our configuration becomes extremely small , on the order of the inverse momentum of the landau pole associated with the higgs sector .",
    "thus our results are valid when the size of our configuration is not on the order of the cutoff necessary to avoid a trivial renormalized higgs self - coupling .",

    "we can see by comparing ( [ energy ] ) with ( [ expansion ] ) that loop contributions to the effective action beyond one loop can only be neglected when @xmath78 .",
    "however , that is precisely the condition where the one - loop contribution can be neglected relative to the classical action .",
    "thus , drawing conclusions concerning solitons based on one - loop results may be difficult .",
    "when dealing with small configurations , one still needs to include higher - loop contributions , even in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we expect the expression ( [ energy ] ) to be valid so long as we can neglect high - loop contributions to the beta functions ( [ beta_g][beta_alpha ] ) , the anomalous dimension ( [ gamma ] ) , and the renormalized greens functions ( [ 1pi - n][1pi-234 ] ) .",
    "higher loop contributions to these quantitities will be negligible if the running couplings associated with the gauge coupling , @xmath79 , and that associated with the scalar self - coupling , @xmath80 , are small . the first criterion is relatively easy to adhere to , since the gauge coupling is asymptotically free and will run to zero with increasingly small sized configurations , subject to @xmath80 being small .",

    "thus , our expression ( [ energy ] ) is valid for configurations whose size , @xmath9 , satisfies @xmath90 when @xmath91 .",
    "recall from our discussion at the end of the last section that the quantum corrections to the energy will be as significant as the classical contribution when @xmath92 .",
    "now we can see from our condition @xmath93 and figure [ fig : figure2 ] that there exists some @xmath94 such that if @xmath95 , the energy ( [ energy ] ) will be both reliable and significantly different than the classical result .",
    "when @xmath96 the quantum corrections are bound to be small where our result is valid .",
    "when the size of the configuration is near the inverse momentum associated with the landau pole , higher - loop contributions to the beta and gamma functions become important and potentially change the size - dependence of the energy . however ,",
