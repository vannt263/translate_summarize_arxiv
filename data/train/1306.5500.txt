    "with the advent of general relativity , the notions of the energy and momentum ( linear and angular ) of a system became elusive .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "firstly , when the spacetime geometry is treated as a dynamical field , energy and momentum are no longer local concepts , i.e. , there is no such thing as an energy or momentum per unit volume , which when integrated over a finite volume yields the total energy or momentum inside that volume .",
    "as we will discuss below , this non - localizable nature applies to both gravitational _ and _ matter fields . in other words , the local stress - energy - momentum tensor of matter",
    ", @xmath4 , is not , in any fundamental way , related to the matter energy or momentum of a finite system .",
    "secondly , energy and momentum are frame - dependent constructs . in newtonian space - time",
    "we have the concept of an inertial reference frame that allows us to define the energy and momentum of a point particle or an extended system _ relative _ to such a frame .",
    "we can even use a frame that is accelerating or rotating , provided we properly account for non - inertial effects .",
    "thus , the key concept is not that of an _ inertial _ frame , but that of a _ rigid _ frame , that is , one in which the distances between all nearest - neighboring pairs of observers comprising the frame are constant in time . in newtonian space - time",
    ", such rigid frames have precisely six arbitrary time - dependent degrees of freedom : three for linear velocity and three for angular velocity .",
    "such rigid frames also exist in special relativity , but their degrees of freedom are restricted to either arbitrary time - dependent linear velocity with _ no rotation _",
    "(  plane motions \" ) , or motion of the frame generated by a killing vector of the flat spacetime (  group motions \" ) , e.g. , constant rotation with one point fixed  @xcite . in general relativity",
    "the situation is worse : in general , _ no _ such rigid frames exist .",
    "this presents a serious obstacle to constructing physically sensible and useful definitions of energy and momentum in the context of general relativity , and their related conservation laws .",
    "the solution to the first problem ( failure of the notion of local energy or momentum ) involves shifting from a local to a _ quasilocal _ way of thinking . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath5 $ ] denote an action functional for a set of dynamical matter fields , @xmath6 , in a spacetime @xmath7 with non - dynamical ( fixed ) background metric @xmath8 .",
    "since the metric is not treated as a dynamical field , @xmath5 $ ] is the _ total _ action functional .",
    "if , as is usually done , we define the total local stress - energy - momentum tensor of the system as the functional derivative of the total action functional with respect to the metric , we have @xmath9=\\int_\\mathcal{m}\\epsilon_\\mathcal{m } \\,t^{ab}\\,\\delta g_{ab}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath10 is the spacetime volume form ) , and so the total local stress - energy - momentum tensor of the system is just the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 .",
    "insofar as a conservation law constructed from @xmath4 will be homogeneous in @xmath4 , it will be essentially blind to any interesting gravitational physics .",
    "however , in general relativity the metric is treated as a dynamical field , and we must add to @xmath5 $ ] the action functional of the gravitational field . using the usual first order action functional for gravity",
    "we then find @xmath11=\\int_\\mathcal{m}\\epsilon_\\mathcal{m } \\",
    ", \\left(t^{ab}-\\frac{1}{\\kappa}g^{ab}\\right)\\,\\delta g_{ab}+\\int_{\\cal b}\\epsilon_{\\cal b } \\ , \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\pi^{ab}\\right)\\,\\delta \\gamma_{ab}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the einstein tensor ) , which tells us that the total local stress - energy - momentum tensor of the system is the sum , @xmath14 , which is just zero by the einstein equation , i.e. , there is no nontrivial local notion of total stress - energy - momentum in general relativity .",
    "note that this statement applies to both gravitational _ and _ matter fields , not just gravitational .",
    "this argument is not new .",
    "the idea that @xmath15 is the local stress - energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational field was independently put forward by both lorentz and levi - civita , but was rejected by einstein on various physical grounds , e.g. , gravitational waves in vacuum could then not transport energy , and einstein and others continued to use a pseudotensor to represent local gravitational stress - energy - momentum  @xcite . we know today that what saves us is the boundary term . on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ t_matter_and_gravity ] )",
    ", @xmath16 is the gravitational momentum conjugate to the three - metric @xmath17 induced on the boundary , @xmath18 . in the spirit of identifying the stress - energy - momentum tensor as the functional derivative of the action with respect to the metric",
    ", one identifies @xmath19 as the _ quasi_local total stress - energy - momentum tensor in general relativity .",
    "it is defined only on the boundary ( energy and momentum per unit _ area _ ) , and includes contributions from both the matter and gravitational fields .",
    "@xmath4 is no longer involved .",
    "this is the essence of what brown and york did in 1993  @xcite .",
    "the solution to the second problem ( failure of the general existence of rigid frames ) also involves shifting from a local to a quasilocal way of thinking .",
    "local thinking suggests that a finite reference frame is a three - parameter family of observers who fill a finite volume of space , and whose worldlines sweep out a four - dimensional worldtube volume of spacetime with three - boundary @xmath20 . to say that this frame is _ rigid _ is to say that the orthogonal distances between all nearest neighboring pairs of observers worldlines remain constant in time .",
    "this represents six differential constrains ( the vanishing of the symmetric spatial strain rate tensor ) on three functions ( the three independent components of the observers four - velocity ) , which is an over - determined system that in general has no solutions .",
    "however , in a newtonian space - time , where the orthogonal distance between worldlines is just the instantaneous spatial distance , the rigidity condition _ does _ have solutions , namely , the six - parameter family of ( not necessarily inertial ) rigid frames we are familiar with in newtonian mechanics .",
    "in special relativity , on the other hand , the orthogonal distance is measured with respect to the flat lorentzian metric , and problems arise due to the relativity of simultaneity , problems which are exacerbated in the curved lorentzian metric of general relativity . as we discovered in references  @xcite ,",
    "the solution is the concept of a _ rigid quasilocal frame _ ( rqf ) . if we consider not the _",
    "three_-parameter family of volume - filling observers , but just the _",
    "two_-parameter family of observers on the boundary of the volume , who sweep out the three - dimensional lorentzian spacetime manifold @xmath20 , the rigidity condition reduces to only _ three _ differential constraints on the same three functions , which always admit solutions , even in general relativity . remarkably , the solutions are precisely analogous to the six - parameter family of rigid frames of newtonian mechanics .",
    "they arise because the two - sphere boundary of any finite spatial volume ( with the topology of a three - ball ) always admits precisely six conformal killing vector fields ( three boosts and three rotations ) that generate an action of the lorentz group on the sphere  @xcite .",
    "physically , an rqf is a congruence with zero expansion and shear , meaning the size and shape of the system boundary do not change , despite the fact that the boundary may be accelerating or rotating .",
    "this allows us to cleanly identify the most relevant energy and momentum fluxes crossing the system boundary ( i.e. , eliminate those fluxes due merely to changes in the size or shape of the boundary ) and , moreover , to obtain simple , exact definitions for the elusive _ gravitational _ versions of those fluxes in terms of operationally - defined geometrical quantities on the boundary .",
    "this paper is a fusion of these two solutions : brown and york s quasilocal stress - energy - momentum tensor and our notion of an rqf .",
    "as we shall see , the real significance of the rqf approach is that it allows us to construct conservation laws for energy and momentum _ without relying on any spacetime symmetries_. in reference  @xcite we constructed a completely general matter plus gravity rqf energy conservation law for spatially finite systems that does not rely on the existence of a timelike killing vector field . in this paper",
    "we do the same , but for linear and angular momentum , without relying on the existence of a spacelike killing vector field .    in  [ local ] we begin with a local momentum conservation law based on the identity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a spatial vector field determining the particular component of linear or angular momentum we are interested in . in general relativity , @xmath23 , and the local conservation law reduces to @xmath24 .",
    "we argue that this differential conservation law integrated over a four - dimensional worldtube volume makes no physical sense unless two conditions are satisfied : ( 1 ) the frame ( three - parameter bundle of worldlines ) must be rigid in the sense discussed above , and ( 2 ) @xmath22 must be a killing vector field of the spatial three - metric on the quotient space of the geometrically rigid bundle of worldlines .",
    "neither of these conditions is satisfied in general , and so such an integrated local momentum conservation law is not general .",
    "we argue that , ultimately , this failure results because the local approach , based on only the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 , does not ( and can not ) properly account for gravitational effects . as an example to close the section",
    ", we specialize this law to a stationary context and construct a general relativistic version of archimedes law .",
    "while archimedes law  @xcite forms the foundation of hydrostatics and has broad applications in a number of disciplines , its application in a general relativistic context has remained almost completely unexplored .",
    "we compare our general relativistic version of archimedes law to a similar law constructed by eriksen and grn  @xcite in the context of accelerated observers in rindler space ( or equivalently , a uniform gravitational field ) .    in  [ quasilocal ]",
    "we properly account for gravitational effects by replacing @xmath4 with brown and york s quasilocal matter plus gravity stress - energy - momentum tensor , and the identity @xmath21 with an analogous identity defined in the boundary spacetime , @xmath20 [ see equation  ( [ differential_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) ] .",
    "the vector field @xmath22 becomes a vector field @xmath25 tangent to @xmath20 .",
    "we argue that the integrated form of this differential conservation law always makes physical sense because : ( 1 ) the rigid quasilocal frames ( rqfs ) discussed above always exist , and ( 2 ) the six conformal killing vector fields discussed above also always exist , and @xmath25 can always be taken to be one them ( three boosts , corresponding to the three components of linear momentum , and three rotations , corresponding to the three components of angular momentum ) .",
    "moreover , the resulting completely general matter plus gravity rqf momentum conservation law for spatially finite systems tells us something new about the physics of momentum conservation .",
    "firstly , it reveals a simple , exact operational definition for gravitational momentum flux ( mentioned above ) that allows us to understand more deeply a wide variety of physical phenomena , including the simple example of a falling apple . secondly ,",
    "while both the local and quasilocal laws handle tangential ( shear ) stresses similarly , the quasilocal law treats stresses normal to the spatial boundary on a different footing , in a novel way that involves the quasilocal _ pressure _ , which can have both matter and gravitational (  geometrical \" ) sources .",
    "we show that the quasilocal law reduces to the local law in the limit of a small - sphere rqf , but in general it involves completely new gravitational effects that are not accounted for in the local law .",
    "we close the section by deriving a quasilocal version of archimedes law which , unlike the local version we constructed at the end of  [ local ] , is as general as such a law can be .",
    "we apply this law to an example of electrostatic weight and buoyant force in the context of the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "we present a brief summary and conclusions in  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section we follow the standard _ local _ conservation law approach to construct an integrated momentum conservation law for matter fields in a finite volume of space in the context of general relativity .",
    "we argue that for this integrated law to make sense , physically , we must impose two conditions ( a rigidity condition in time and a killing vector condition in space ) that _ can not _ always be satisfied . when they _ can _ be satisfied , and when we can further specialize to a certain _ stationary _ context , we can construct a general relativistic version of archimedes law for matter fields ( e.g. , electromagnetism ) , which illustrates how maxwell stress - like buoyant forces support the matter weight contained in a non - inertial reference frame .",
    "we compare this law with that constructed by eriksen and grn  @xcite for electromagnetism in the context of uniformly accelerating ( rindler ) observers in flat spacetime .      given a smooth , four - dimensional lorentzian manifold , @xmath26 , with metric @xmath27 and associated derivative operator @xmath28 , the identity @xmath29 provides the differential form of a local conservation law for the current @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor . in the context of general relativity , @xmath23 . to integrate this conservation law",
    ", we consider a spatially finite three - parameter family of observers with four - velocity vector field @xmath31 tangent to their congruence of worldlines .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the three - dimensional lorentzian manifold boundary of this bundle of worldlines .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote two finite spacelike three - surfaces slicing through the bundle ( respectively the initial and final volumes of space ) , and @xmath34 denote the section of @xmath20 lying between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "finally , let @xmath35 denote the finite spacetime four - volume contained within these boundaries .",
    "see figure  1 . integrating equation  ( [ differential_local_conservation_law ] ) over @xmath35 yields the integrated form of this differential conservation law : @xmath36 here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the timelike future - directed unit vector field orthogonal to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath38 denotes the spacelike outward - directed unit vector field orthogonal to @xmath20 .",
    "follows a timelike worldline @xmath39 with tangent four - velocity vector @xmath31 , which is not necessarily parallel to the timelike vector field @xmath40 orthogonal to @xmath41 .",
    "the one - parameter family of spatial volumes , @xmath41 , foliate the four - dimensional spacetime region , @xmath42 , whose timelike worldtube boundary , @xmath43 , has spacelike unit normal vector field @xmath44 . ]    roughly speaking , for a suitably - chosen spacelike vector field @xmath22 , this is a momentum conservation law that says that the difference in the matter three - momentum contained in the finite volumes @xmath32 and @xmath33 equals the flux of three - momentum that entered through the system boundary @xmath43 , plus a bulk @xmath45 contribution arising when @xmath22 is not a killing vector field .",
    "we will be more precise later in this section .    to make the physical content of this law more transparent we decompose @xmath4 as : @xmath46 where @xmath47\\;\\;{\\rm ( e.g.,\\ ; maxwell\\;stress)}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 is the projection operator into the vector space orthogonal to the worldlines of the congruence , and",
    "@xmath49 is the corresponding volume form in this space .",
    "the last equality corresponds to the example of electromagnetism , which will be used later when we compare our results with that in reference  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are the proper electric and magnetic fields seen by the observers with four - velocity @xmath31  @xcite .    to get a momentum conservation law we set @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is orthogonal to ( the worldlines of ) the congruence .",
    "we then arbitrarily choose a time function on @xmath54 , i.e. , a foliation of @xmath54 by spacelike three - surfaces , @xmath41 , of constant time parameter , @xmath55 ( that coincide with @xmath32 and @xmath33 at times @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , and set @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the lapse function .",
    "we naturally extend the definition of @xmath60 to all @xmath41 surfaces ( as opposed to on just @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is orthogonal to the congruence , and @xmath63 is a lorentz factor .",
    "@xmath62 represents the three - velocity of fiducial observers who are ` at rest ' with respect to @xmath41 ( whose hypersurface - orthogonal four - velocity is @xmath60 ) as measured by our congruence of observers ( whose four - velocity is @xmath31 ) .",
    "we will refer to these as the @xmath60- and @xmath31-observers , respectively .",
    "note that while @xmath60 is hypersurface orthogonal , @xmath31 need not be , i.e. , we are allowing for a twisting congruence . with these definitions , the conservation law in equation  ( [ integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) reads : @xmath64.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath65 is the proper three - volume element seen by the @xmath31-observers .",
    "it is constructed from @xmath66 , the ` radar ranging ' metric that measures the orthogonal distance between neighboring worldlines of the congruence .",
    "similarly , @xmath67 is the proper two - surface element constructed from @xmath68 , the ` radar ranging ' metric between neighboring worldlines of the congruence restricted to @xmath20 . in expanding the term @xmath69 in equation  ( [ integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) we made use of the following definitions associated with properties of the @xmath31-congruence : the observers four - acceleration",
    "is defined as @xmath70 ; the strain rate tensor ( i.e. , expansion and shear ) of the congruence is defined as @xmath71 , and the twist as @xmath72 ; and the derivative operator induced in the vector space orthogonal to the congruence is defined as @xmath73 .    the left - hand side of equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) is the change ( between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) in the @xmath53-component of the matter ( e.g. , electromagnetic ) momentum in the @xmath41 system , as measured by the @xmath31-observers .",
    "one might wonder why there is a maxwell stress - like term in the integrand .",
    "recall that the integrand started as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the matter four - momentum per unit volume as measured by the @xmath78-observers , who are co - moving with the @xmath41 system ( i.e. , their four - velocity is orthogonal to @xmath41 ) .",
    "multiplying by @xmath79 gives the amount of matter four - momentum ( again , as measured by the @xmath78-observers ) contained in their proper volume element @xmath79 of @xmath41 .",
    "contracting the resulting four - vector with @xmath80 yields the @xmath53-component of three - momentum as seen by the @xmath31-observers along _ their _ space axes . finally , integrating over @xmath41 yields the total @xmath53-momentum in the @xmath41 system , as measured by the @xmath31-observers at time @xmath55 , who see the @xmath41 system as being in motion .",
    "so we are calculating the right thing .",
    "the @xmath62 in @xmath78 then results in the extra maxwell stress - like term in the integrand .",
    "similarly , it is easy to see that instead of just @xmath81 we will have @xmath82 in the integrand when we choose @xmath83 , and are dealing with an energy ( instead of a three - momentum ) conservation law  @xcite .",
    ", from our previous papers to match the sign convention in references  @xcite .",
    "] this _ covariant _ definition of matter four - momentum is the same as rohrlich s 1960 definition of electromagnetic four - momentum  @xcite , which solved the infamous  @xmath84 problem \" in the classical theory of the electron ( which was solved in essentially the same way by fermi in 1922  @xcite , but apparently forgotten ) .",
    "compare rohrlich s equation  ( 17 ) with our equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) .",
    "we are just seeing rohrlich s electromagnetic four - momentum in special relativity generalized to arbitrary matter four - momentum in general relativity . to help clarify the parallel between our work here and rohrlich s work on the electron , our @xmath31-observers ( who will be moving _",
    "rigidly_see next subsection ) correspond to rohrlich s _ at rest _ observers ; they are observing a _ moving _ @xmath41 system that corresponds to rohrlich s moving electron .",
    "our @xmath78-observers correspond to the observers co - moving with rohrlich s electron .    to understand the extra maxwell stress - like term physically , consider for example a set of @xmath31-observers who see the @xmath41 system moving with velocity @xmath62 in the azimuthal direction ( i.e. , rotating relative to them ) , and choose @xmath53 also in the azimuthal direction .",
    "then the additional stress term is of the form @xmath85 . in relativity theory",
    ", pressure makes a relativistic contribution to inertia ; indeed , @xmath86 has the dimensions of mass per unit volume .",
    "so matter ( e.g. , electromagnetic ) pressure in a rotating system is equivalent to a rotating mass , which must contribute to the momentum ( _ angular _ momentum in this example ) .",
    "hence the @xmath87 term in equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) .",
    "so far , our analysis has been completely general .",
    "before discussing the terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) it will be helpful to first simplify the equation by specializing it to the case of _ rigid motion _ ,",
    "which , as we shall see , is ultimately necessary to achieve a physically sensible matter momentum conservation law for a finite - sized system .",
    "for reasons that will be made clear shortly , suppose that the @xmath31-observers are moving _ rigidly _ ,",
    "i.e. , that the orthogonal distance between the worldlines of all nearest neighboring pairs of @xmath31-observers is constant in time .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath88 , i.e. , we have a congruence with zero expansion and shear . since this represents six differential constraints on three functions ( the three independent components of @xmath31 ) ,",
    "this can not always be realized .",
    "( however , as we will discuss in  [ quasilocalrigidmotion ] , the quasilocal analogue of this condition _ can _ always be realized . ) in the sequel we will simply assume we are in a context in which this rigidity condition _ is _ satisfied .",
    "as a first consequence , we obviously have that the spatial integration measures @xmath89 and @xmath67 in equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) are time - independent .",
    "now let @xmath90 denote any vector field orthogonal to the congruence , which the @xmath31-observers would consider to be purely spatial , i.e. , to lie along their space axes . for this vector field to appear _ stationary _ to the rigidly - moving @xmath31-observers ( i.e. , not change with time ) , @xmath90 must be lie - dragged along the fibres , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "contracting both sides with @xmath92 reveals the proportionality factor , and we find that we require : @xmath93 we will call spatial vector fields satisfying this condition _",
    "stationary_. in a context in which the rigidity condition holds , such stationary vector fields can be uniquely constructed throughout @xmath45 given their specification on any one spatial three - surface , e.g. , @xmath74 .",
    "our conservation law is for the @xmath53-component of the matter momentum .",
    "obviously , we would certainly want @xmath53 to be stationary , and will assume that such a choice has been made . using equation  ( [ stationary_vectors ] ) with @xmath94",
    "we find that @xmath95 , and so two of the terms in the @xmath45 integrand in equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) can be combined into one : @xmath96 = -2\\epsilon_{abc}\\nu^a\\mathbb{p}^b\\phi^c.\\ ] ] recalling the usual vector formula for a coriolis force , @xmath97 , equation  ( [ coriolis ] ) is clearly the @xmath53-component of a matter coriolis force density , which is associated with a change in the @xmath53-component of the matter momentum as seen by our @xmath31-observers in the case that they are rotating ( twisting congruence ) .",
    "notice that it includes the correct factor of @xmath98 : half of the effect arises from the position - dependence of the relative velocity of points in the rotating frame ( the first term on the left - hand side ) , and the other half arises from the rate at which the rotating frame coordinate axes change direction ( the second term on the left - hand side ) .",
    "relatedly , the @xmath99 $ ] term in equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) includes the @xmath53-component of the sum of the matter euler (  @xmath100 \" ) and centrifugal (  @xmath101 \" ) force densities , written in a covariant form that does not involve a radial vector (  @xmath102 .    finally , we consider the term @xmath103 in equation  ( [ explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) . if we introduce",

    "equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) is a completely general matter momentum conservation law in the context of general relativity .",
    "it says that the change ( between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) in the @xmath53-component of the matter momentum contained in the system , as measured by the @xmath31-observers , is equal to the @xmath53-component of the impulse imparted to the system by matter stresses acting on the system boundary over that time interval ( the @xmath43 integral ) , plus a correction due to the non - inertial motion ( acceleration and rotation ) of the rigid @xmath31-frame ( the @xmath45 integral ) .",
    "before we move on , there is an important subtlety in equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) worth pointing out . in the context of special relativity ( and also newtonian space - time ) , we sometimes come across the integral of a vector field  e.g .",
    ", imagine equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) without the contraction of the integrands with @xmath113 .",

    "of course such an integral makes no sense in the context of general relativity , where we can not add vectors with different base points .",

    "if we start at a given point and integrate @xmath53 to two different points on the same neighboring fibre ( by following two different paths ) , the resulting @xmath53 will satisfy equation  ( [ stationary_vectors ] ) . ] in the case of our three - parameter family of worldlines , this integration data corresponds to six discrete degrees of freedom , resulting in six linearly independent killing vector fields ( three translational and three rotational ) corresponding to six components of momentum ( three linear and three angular ) that can be analyzed in equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) . so requiring",
    "that @xmath53 be a killing vector field with respect to @xmath66 is not only  natural \" ( word used earlier ) , it is _ crucial _ for equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) to make any physical sense ( which , in turn , is predicated on the rigidity condition being satisfied ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath66 must admit the _ maximal _ number of killing vector fields .",
    "the fact that this condition generically _ can not _ be satisfied is a serious problem , not to mention the fact that the rigidity condition , too , generically _ can not _ be satisfied .",
    "we emphasize this point because ( as mentioned earlier ) , both the killing ( actually , _ conformal _ killing ) vector and rigidity conditions can always be realized in the quasilocal context , as we will discuss in  [ quasilocalrigidmotion ] .",
    "we now turn to formulating an archimedes law in general relativity .",
    "archimedes law is usually envisioned in a static , or at most a stationary context , which is certainly the simplest case , and the one we will explore here .",
    "but at this point , the rigid frame defined by the @xmath31-observers may still be undergoing time - dependent acceleration and/or rotation .",
    "so to formulate an archimedes law , it is natural to further assume that we are in a context in which @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( which are both orthogonal to the congruence ) are stationary .",
    "it is easy to show that the spatial coordinate components of @xmath123 and @xmath124 are : @xmath125 and the time coordinate components identically vanish . assuming rigidity of the @xmath31-frame , stationarity of @xmath121 and @xmath122 is equivalent to @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "naturally , we assume that @xmath62the three - velocity of the @xmath60-observers relative to the @xmath31-frame  is also stationary , i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath129 since equation  ( [ definition_of_hso_u ] ) implies @xmath130 . with @xmath129 , the acceleration",
    "@xmath131 is a pure gradient . demanding stationary acceleration then implies both a time - independent lapse function ( so the _ full _ integration measures in equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) are time - independent ) and a stationary twist .",
    "having imposed conditions on the congruence of observers ( rigidity , plus stationary acceleration and twist ) , and specified the @xmath53 the observers will use ( a stationary @xmath66 killing vector field ) , we have established a suitable , stationary framework in which the measurements of the matter ( e.g. , electromagnetic ) field will be made .",
    "the final step is to assume that the matter field itself is stationary , which means @xmath81 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 in equation  ( [ maxwell_stress ] ) are stationary .",

    "it basically says that the weight of the matter field in a non - inertial reference frame ( right - hand side ) is supported by a maxwell stress - like buoyant force acting on the field inside through the boundary of the system ( left - hand side ) .    in the case that the matter field is electromagnetism , this result is essentially identical to the main result , equation  ( 6.15 ) , in eriksen and grn s beautiful paper  @xcite , except for three key differences : ( 1 ) we have generalized the result from _",
    "static _ to _ stationary _ contexts by allowing for stationary rotation ( the addition of the coriolis term ) .",
    "( 2 ) we do not incorporate the lapse function , @xmath59 , into the definition of the ( electromagnetic ) stress , energy , and momentum densities .",
    "for example , eriksen and grn s definition of the maxwell stress ( @xmath135 in their equation  ( 6.12 ) ) in multiplied by @xmath59 ( @xmath136 in their notation ) , compared to the standard definition in our equation  ( [ maxwell_stress ] ) .",
    "we prefer to show the lapse function explicitly to highlight an important aspect of the actual _ mechanism _ of the buoyancy . in ",
    "[ example ] we will exhibit a simple example in which @xmath137 , i.e. , the maxwell stress on one side of the surface balances that on other side , and so one might expect zero net buoyancy . that the net effect is _ not _ zero follows from the fact that the acceleration induces an inhomogeneous time dilation ( encoded in @xmath59 ) , so observers on one side of the surface experience the _ same _ ( magnitude of ) proper force , but for a _ longer _ proper time , than on the other side , resulting in a net buoyant impulse acting on the system .",
    "similar consequences of an inhomogeneous time dilation were noticed in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) eriksen and grn work in the context of rindler observers in special relativity .",
    "here we work in the context of accelerating and/or rotating rigid frames in general relativity .",
    "this is not to say , however , that equation  ( [ local_archimedes ] ) ( or more generally , equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) ) is describing what is really happening in the general relativistic context .",
    "we believe it is not , because it does not properly account for gravitational effects .",
    "to do so requires not a local , but a quasilocal approach , which we turn to presently .",
    "in this section we will use a quasilocal approach to construct an integrated momentum conservation law for both matter and gravitational fields contained in a finite volume of space .",
    "such an approach was initiated by brown and york  @xcite , and we have further developed the approach in references  @xcite , in particular through the novel idea of a _ rigid quasilocal frame _ ( rqf ) .",
    "recall that the integrated local matter momentum conservation law in equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) required two key conditions to make it physically sensible : a rigid motion condition and a killing vector condition , neither of which can be satisfied in general . here",
    "we show how these two serious obstacles , inherent in the local approach to constructing a momentum conservation law , are overcome in the quasilocal approach using rqfs , yielding a conservation law of general validity .",
    "the essence of the solution is the proper inclusion of gravitational effects .",
    "we begin with an identity analogous to equation  ( [ differential_local_conservation_law ] ) , except constructed in the three - dimensional lorentzian manifold , @xmath20 , the boundary of the bundle of worldlines defined in  [ local-1 ] ,",

    "the matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , initially absent in equation  ( [ integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) , will enter once einstein s equation is invoked , in which case the first term on the right - hand side becomes @xmath153 .",
    "this term looks very much like @xmath154 , the matter stress term in the local conservation law in equation  ( [ integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) .",
    "however , there are two important differences .",
    "first , the origins of these two terms are completely different . unlike @xmath154 , @xmath155 does _ not _ come from integrating a divergence .",
    "it comes from the fact that @xmath156 ( in contrast to @xmath23 ) , and so is analogous to the lorentz force density in electrodynamics ( except that , unlike in electrodynamics , where the lorentz force density acts only on the sources of the electromagnetic field , @xmath157 acts on _ all _ of the fields in the system , matter and gravitational ) .",
    "the second important difference is that @xmath25 in @xmath155 is _ tangent _ to @xmath20 , whereas @xmath22 in @xmath154 need not be  it can ( and often does ) have a component in the normal direction , @xmath44 . to see the significance of this ,",

    "while there is no problem setting @xmath159 in the local conservation law , in the quasilocal law @xmath25 can accommodate only the _ tangential _ component of @xmath158 , not the normal component .",
    "so the quasilocal law seems to be missing the normal ( pressure ) contribution to the external matter force , @xmath160 .",
    "however , through an application of the ` radial ' hamiltonian constraint of general relativity , we will show that this  missing \" normal matter force is found in the @xmath161 term in equation  ( [ integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) .    before proceeding further with the analysis of equation  ( [ integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) ,",
    "let us first introduce a more transparent notation for @xmath162 .",
    "following brown and york  @xcite , we resolve the quasilocal stress - energy - momentum tensor into components adapted to the @xmath31-observers : @xmath163 where @xmath164 here @xmath165 is the projection operator into the vector space tangent to @xmath20 and orthogonal to the fibres of the congruence , and @xmath166 is the corresponding volume form in this space .",

    "on the other hand , this would _ not _ be the right thing to do , since a two - dimensional space admits at most three killing vectors , corresponding essentially to three components of angular momentum  we would be missing the the three components of linear momentum .",

    "summarizing , in the quasilocal approach it is always possible to choose the @xmath31-observers to be in _ rigid _ motion ( i.e. , to comprise an rqf ) , and to choose a spatial vector field , @xmath171 , that is a stationary conformal killing vector field ( ckv with respect to @xmath199 , not @xmath17 ) .",

    "this completely general rqf momentum conservation law for matter _ and _ gravitational fields is to be compared with the less general ( valid only in special spacetimes that admit both a rigid three - parameter congruence and a spatial killing vector field orthogonal to the congruence ) and incomplete ( includes matter fields only , not gravitational ) local momentum conservation law in equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) .",
    "there are two key differences between equations  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) and ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) .",
    "the first is the obvious shift from integrations over volume densities to integrations over surface densities . to understand the physical significance of this shift ,",
    "consider a simple problem in relativistic mechanics .",
    "imagine being inside an accelerating box in flat spacetime that contains a freely - floating , massive object that appears to accelerate toward us ; the object s momentum ( relative to us ) changes due to the acceleration of our frame .",
    "if the instantaneous proper acceleration of our frame is @xmath211 , a simple calculation reveals that the change in momentum during an infinitesimal proper time interval @xmath212 is given by @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is the instantaneous relativistic energy of the object ( and the minus sign reflects the fact that @xmath215 and @xmath211 are in opposite directions ) .",
    "this explains the bulk term , @xmath216 , in the local law , equation  ( [ rigid_kv_explicit_integrated_local_conservation_law ] ) .",
    "but since momentum is a conserved quantity we now must ask : where does this new momentum in the system come from ? this might sound like a silly question  after all , momentum is frame - dependent , and we are just changing the frame ! however , the question is perhaps not so silly when we ask it in the context of the equivalence principle . instead of being inside an accelerating box",
    ", we could imagine that the box is at rest in a uniform gravitational field , and that the object is experiencing an acceleration toward us due to the  force \" of gravity .",
    "this  force \" acting over time imparts an impulse to the object , i.e. , it represents a transfer of the momentum of _ something _ to the momentum of the object . if it was an electromagnetic force we would say that the  something \" is the electromagnetic field ( and ultimately , the source of that field ) . since the  force \" is gravitational , the  something \" must be the gravitational field ( and ultimately , the source of that field ) .",
    "there must be some kind of surface flux representing _ gravitational _ momentum entering the box from the outside . according to the general relativistic equation  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) , that gravitational momentum flux is @xmath217 , which has dimensions of momentum per unit area per unit time",
    ". so the  mass times acceleration \" bulk term , @xmath218 , in the local conservation law has become a bona fide gravitational momentum flux term , @xmath217 , in the quasilocal conservation law , exactly as anticipated in our equivalence principle argument .    in the context of general relativity ,",
    "the presence of mass - energy ( matter or gravitational ) inside a system causes a change in the spatial trace of the extrinsic curvature , @xmath219 , of the two - sphere the rqf observers reside on . since @xmath220 , measuring this change in extrinsic curvature ( using a ruler ) is operationally how the rqf observers measure the mass - energy in the system . for an everyday mass , @xmath221 , and areal radius of the rqf , @xmath222 ,",
    "the magnitude of this change is exceedingly tiny , of order @xmath223 ( as one can see by dimensional analysis ) .",
    "nevertheless , multiplying this usually tiny general relativistic effect by the large number @xmath224 ( and then integrating over the sphere ) converts it into what we understand in classical mechanics as the mass of the object inside our frame of reference .",
    "this everyday mass , times an everyday acceleration , integrated over an everyday time interval , then gives an everyday change in momentum .",
    "but it is important to appreciate that the mass of an object times the acceleration of the frame in classical mechanics really represents a general relativistic transfer of gravitational momentum through the boundary of our reference frame , effected by a coupling between extrinsic curvature and acceleration . in other words , we claim that the simple expression , @xmath217 , is actually the exact operational definition of gravitational momentum flux in general relativity ( and similar comments apply to the @xmath225 expression ) .",
    "so the rqf momentum conservation law in equation  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) leads us to a deeper understanding of physics : it explains in detail what is actually happening with regards to momentum transfer when , say , an apple falls .",
    "we discovered an exactly analogous result for energy transfer in reference  @xcite , except in place of a tiny change in extrinsic curvature we had a tiny frame dragging effect . but both are _ general relativistic _ effects .",
    "the second key difference between the local and quasilocal momentum conservation laws is the extra @xmath226 term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) . in the next subsection",
    "we will show that it is this term that contains , in a subtle and interesting way , the missing normal ( @xmath227 pressure ) contribution to the external matter force acting on the system , as alluded to earlier .",
    "( remember that in equation  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) , @xmath228 was replaced with @xmath229 , and so we are comparing @xmath230 in the local law with @xmath231 in the quasilocal law .",
    "the _ difference _ , we claim , is contained in the extra @xmath226 term . )      general relativity imposes four constraint equations that intertwine the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of @xmath20 with matter .",
    "the rqf momentum conservation law in equation  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) represents two of these constraint equations . the rqf energy conservation law ( see reference  @xcite ) represents the third .",

    "( note that , since the vacuum energy density is _ negative _ , this weight is ` up ' and the buoyant force is ` down ' . ) of course such a cancelation _ must _ happen because there are no other terms in the conservation law at this order in @xmath222 , and the conservation law is an identity .",

    "first , note that to lowest order in @xmath222 , the lapse function must have the form @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the acceleration of a fiducial point at the center of the small round - sphere rqf in usual boldface vector notation .",

    "a bit of thought ( and experience with rqfs ) shows that the @xmath281 and @xmath282 terms will not play a dominant role , but the other two terms will .",
    "a short calculation reveals that , in the context of an rqf , the ricci scalar associated with @xmath17 ( the intrinsic geometry of @xmath20 ) can be written as @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the ricci scalar associated with @xmath199 ( the geometry of the two - sphere quotient space ) , which , for the case of a round - sphere rqf of areal radius @xmath222 , is @xmath285 ( exact ) .",
    "the next - to - leading order term is @xmath286 , and the rest are higher order . combining these results with the series expansion for @xmath167 given in equation  ( [ quasilocalenergyexpansion ] ) we find : @xmath287 the dominant term for small @xmath222 is a negative _ vacuum pressure _ , whose existence is intimately connected with the existence of the vacuum energy density through the geometrical identity @xmath288 discussed more fully in reference  @xcite .",
    "if we think of the negative vacuum pressure as a positive surface tension in the balloon analogy used earlier , then a similar calculation shows that the system must do an amount of positive work equal to @xmath289 to expand the areal radius by an amount @xmath290 , which is exactly the amount by which the ( negative ) vacuum energy of the system is reduced during this expansion .",
    "so the two vacuum entities are logically self - consistent .",
    "given that the vacuum pressure is _ uniform _ over the surface of the sphere ( no gradient ) one might assume that it does not create a buoyant force",

    "( this is due to the acceleration - induced inhomogeneous time dilation mechanism mentioned in the last paragraph of  [ localarchimedes ] . )",
    "the next - to - leading order term in @xmath247 is a dipole term that accounts for the other half of the buoyant force supporting the vacuum weight . putting all of these results together we have : @xmath291\\,\\hat{d}_b\\phi^b.\\ ] ] integrating @xmath292 by parts results in equation  ( [ vacuumbuoyancy ] ) with @xmath293 $ ] .",

    ", the quasilocal law reduces to the local one ; but as the system gets larger , the quasilocal law clearly departs from the local law in what it is saying .",
    "thus , the local law _ does not explain what is really happening_. the local law treats the tangential ( shear ) components of force and weight on the same footing as the normal components .",
    "the quasilocal law does not .",
    "the normal components are accounted for in an entirely different way  through the quasilocal pressure term , @xmath295 , which has no analogue in the local law .",

    "similarly , regarding the boundary ricci scalar in equation ( [ ricciscalar ] ) , we verify that we can neglect the last two terms on the right - hand side since @xmath377 ( and @xmath378 ) , while @xmath379 ( exactly ) and @xmath380 starts at order @xmath280 . with these details",
    "confirmed , we arrive at equation  ( [ vacuumbuoyancyactual ] ) , which verifies that the sum of the left - hand sides of equations  ( [ vacuumweight ] ) and ( [ vacuumbuoyancy ] ) vanishes at orders @xmath376 and @xmath280 , modulo spherical harmonic terms that integrate to zero . using maple we take the analysis two orders in @xmath222 higher , up to and including the order at which matter begins to contribute .",
    "the expressions contain a large number of spherical harmonic terms , but upon integration we arrive at a simple result for the ( effective ) weight of the electrostatic field inside the rqf : @xmath381= \\frac{\\mathbb{e}_\\mathtt{em}}{c^2}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3 } r^3\\right ) a_0 + \\mathcal{o } ( r^4),\\ ] ] in agreement with the effective buoyant force in equation  ( [ lhs_quasilocal_archimedes ] ) .",
    "the local approach to constructing integrated energy and momentum conservation laws begins with the differential identity given in equation  ( [ differential_local_conservation_law ] ) , which reduces to @xmath24 in general relativity .",
    "the problems with this approach are essentially two - fold : ( 1 ) being local , this approach can not account for gravitational effects , which are nonlocal ( this is reflected in the fact that the identity is empty when @xmath382 ) , and ( 2 ) we get the intuitive form of a conservation law ( namely , that the change in a physical quantity over time equals the net corresponding flux through the system boundary during that time ) only when @xmath22 is a killing vector field , i.e. , the approach relies on the existence of spacetime symmetries , which rules out spacetimes with interesting matter or gravitational dynamics .    a natural solution to the first problem is to replace the local matter stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 , with the brown and york quasilocal stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath152 , which represents both matter _ and _ gravitational fields , and which satisfies the differential identity @xmath383 [ equation  ( [ differential_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) ] in the boundary , @xmath20  @xcite . the solution to the second problem is to replace the notion of a rigid local frame ( which , we argued , is required to make sense of an integrated conservation law , but does not always exist ) with a rigid quasilocal frame ( rqf ) ( which always exists )  @xcite . if @xmath25 is chosen to be @xmath384 ( where @xmath31 is the rqf observers four - velocity ) we get a completely general rqf _ energy _ conservation law for matter and gravitational fields in a finite system in general relativity ( discussed in our previous paper  @xcite ) . as shown in the present paper , if @xmath25 is chosen to be @xmath385 , where @xmath171 is a stationary conformal killing vector ( ckv ) field orthogonal to @xmath31 ( the full set of six of which always exists ) we get the completely general rqf _ momentum _ conservation law given in equation  ( [ reduced_integrated_quasilocal_conservation_law ] ) : @xmath386\\right\\},\\ ] ] which is a conservation law for linear or angular momentum according to whether @xmath171 is one of the three boost or three rotation ckv fields .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation gives the change in the momentum contained in the system as measured by the rqf observers between the initial and final times .",
    "the right - hand side is the flux of momentum ( including the gravitational momentum flux , @xmath217 ) entering the system from the outside during this time . in short ,",
    "we have constructed completely general energy  @xcite and momentum conservation laws that _ do not rely on any spacetime symmetries_. the notion of an rqf plays a crucial role in the construction of these laws .",
    "these new energy and momentum conservation laws teach us some new physics .",
    "they allow us to identify simple , exact , operational definitions for fluxes of gravitational energy  @xcite and momentum ( linear and angular ) , and these fluxes in turn provide a deeper insight into what s really happening in a wide variety of physical phenomena .",
    "for instance , some simple , everyday effects in newtonian mechanics are actually very tiny , subtle general relativistic effects multiplied by a large number ( like @xmath224 or @xmath387 ) to become effects we see in the everyday world .",
    "when we drop an apple , for example , the apple gains energy and momentum relative to our accelerated frame of reference at rest on the earth .",
    "the gain in energy is due to a gravitational energy flux involving the general relativistic effect of frame dragging  @xcite ; the gain in momentum is due to a gravitational momentum flux involving the general relativistic effect that mass - energy has on the extrinsic curvature of the boundary of the reference frame .",
    "insofar as energy and momentum have traditionally been useful concepts in physics , we hope that these new , completely general rqf energy and momentum conservation laws will further deepen our understanding of energy and momentum , and find useful applications . towards this end , we derived a general relativistic version of archimedes law , which we applied to understand how the weight of a small volume of electrostatic field , located a fixed distance from a reissner - nordstrm black hole , is supported by the maxwell stress buoyant forces of the surrounding electrostatic field . to our surprise",
    ", we found that the net buoyant force is actually zero , but the net buoyant _ impulse _ is not .",
    "the nonzero buoyant impulse is due to an acceleration - induced inhomogeneous time dilation at the boundary of the reference frame , as revealed by the rqf momentum conservation law .",
