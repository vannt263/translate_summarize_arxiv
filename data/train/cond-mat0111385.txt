    "in a recent paper eremets _ _ et al.__@xcite reported experiments where boron transforms from a non - metal at normal pressures to a superconductor at very high pressures above 160 gpa .",

    "assuming that the fcc phase is the real high pressure structure in the experiments of eremets _ _ et al.__@xcite , this indicates that the simple rmt theory accounts for high - pressure superconductivity in boron .",
    "in this work we have applied the rmt theory@xcite to calculate the hopfield parameter @xmath2 given by the expression :      where @xmath5 is the scattering phase shift at the fermi energy @xmath6 and angular momentum @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the single - scatterer density of states which , as defined in ref .  , is an integral involving the radial wave functions .",
