    "recently , optical rogue waves attracted a lot of attention , owing to their strange properties @xcite . as a pheonomenon , rogue wave originated in oceans , as an extreme localized wave that suddenly appears and disappears without a trace .",
    "however , it is now accepted that , as a _ nonlinear _ phenomenon , it can be well described by the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "the cubic nlse possesses a variety of solutions @xcite , some of which can serve as prototypical rogue waves .",
    "these include peregrine solitons @xcite , kuznetsov - ma breathers @xcite , akhmediev breathers ( abs ) @xcite , higher - order rogue waves @xcite , and fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) recurrent pulses @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that these solutions are _ not _ rogue waves _ per se _ but can be used to model ones .",
    "the true rogue waves are extreme wave phenomena that sporadically appear in the interaction of solutions of different nlses and require statistical description for evidence and confirmation .",
    "the solutions mentioned above are by and large exact solutions to nlse that contain solitary or trains of pulses , ride on finite backgrounds , and are prone to modulation instabilites .",
    "it is in the devlopment of unstable wavefronts that extreme or freak waves may appear .    on the other hand ,",
    "talbot effect represents a self - imaging phenomenon in the near - field diffraction of plane waves , first observed by h. f. talbot @xcite and theoretically explained by lord rayleigh @xcite .",
    "this effect is a spatial recurrence phenomenon : if one records directly beyond a narrow diffraction slit the beam intensity along the propagation direction , one sees a series of periodic diminishings and revivals , generated by the interference of diffracted secondary wavelets coming from different slits .",
    "stretched in the transverse dimension , one observes the so - called talbot carpet .",
    "the greatness of the effect lies in the fact that essentially all one needs to observe periodicity along the longitudinal direction is the periodicity of input in the transverse direction .    owing to its potential applications in image preprocessing and synthesis , photolithography , optical testing , optical metrology , spectrometry , and optical computing ,",
    "talbot effect has been reported in , but not confined to , atomic optics @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , waveguide arrays @xcite , photonic lattices @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , x - ray imaging @xcite , and in an interferometer for c@xmath1 fullerene molecules @xcite .",
    "recent research indicates that talbot effect can also be obtained using spherical waves @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned talbot effect represents various linear cases @xcite , even the so - called `` nonlinear effect '' from ref . @xcite .",
    "although the nonlinear talbot effect was apparently previously investigated @xcite , it is different from the one that will be described here .",
    "the topic is still in need of further exploration , because interdisciplinary research  in this case of rogue waves , talbot effect , and self - fourier transformation  tends to induce new ideas and applications .",
    "therefore , we will restrict our attention to just one basic rogue wave solution that displays the nonlinear talbot effect  the akhmediev breather",
    ". however , we will consider other inputs as well .",
    "an ab wave is periodic along the transverse coordinate and decays along the longitudinal coordinate ",
    "it is a transverse train of single optical pulses .",
    "when such a train is launched into a nonlinear kerr medium , owing to modulation instability and nonlinear interference of propagating pulses , a talbot recurrence phenomenon is observed .",
    "hence , if the medium is nonlinear , then one obtains the nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "there exists a similar nonlinear recurrence phenomenon in fibers  the fermi - pasta - ulam recurrence ; it s 60th birthday was just celebrated @xcite . nevertheless , the two effects are different in nature .",
    "even though both can be described by the nlse , fpu is a temporal phenomenon , whereas the nonlinear talbot effect is a spatial phenomenon .",
    "the nonlinear talbot effect of rogue waves has recently been reported @xcite .",
    "although a periodic initial condition is always required for a talbot effect , the nonlinear talbot effect is in stark contrast to the linear one .",
    "the linear talbot requires real gratings or periodic diffracting structures for generation , it forms in linear homogenous media , and can be generally explained by the fresnel diffraction theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the nonlinear talbot effect requires periodic inputs that ride on a finite background , happens in bulk nl media , and possesses no adequate theoretical explanation .",
    "in this paper , we report both linear and nonlinear talbot effects in two dimensions , but focus on the nonlinear talbot effect formed from rogue and other waves in a bulk nonlinear medium .",
    "the two - dimensional nonlinear talbot effect is investigated here for the first time , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) talbot effect is essentially a 3d optical phenomenon ; it results in the formation of 3d periodic optical structures . in passing",
    ", we also note that talbot effect can be regarded as a self - fourier transform of input beams .",
    "we first construct the incidence from a product of two 1d ( doubly periodic ) abs , and then propagate it in a linear and nonlinear kerr medium .",
    "the result is a 3d stack of talbot carpets .",
    "similar to the nonlinear 1d talbot effect reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which not only originates from an exact rogue wave but also requires bulk nl medium to form , such 1d and 2d nonlinear talbot effects are different from those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we briefly introduce the theoretical model and construct the input from rogue wave solutions . in sec .",
    "[ lineartalbot ] linear talbot effect ( coming also from rogue waves ) is reviewed theoretically and numerically , as a background for the nonlinear talbot effect . in sec .",
    "[ nonlineartalbot ] we numerically investigate in some detail the nonlinear talbot effect from rogue wave solutions , as well as from other periodic inputs .",
    "the paper is concluded with sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the propagation of a beam with envelope @xmath2 in a kerr medium can be generally described by the normalized cubic nlse @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transverse laplacian ; in one dimension it is @xmath5 and in two dimensions @xmath6 .",
    "the transverse coordinates are measured in units of some characteristic transverse length , whereas the longitudinal coordinate is given in terms of the corresponding rayleigh range .",
    "one of the rogue solutions of the 1d nlse is the akhmediev breather @xcite @xmath7 \\times \\exp(iz),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a free parameter ranging from 0 to 1/2 .",
    "this solution is periodic in the transverse direction and dies fast in the propagation ( @xmath11 ) direction .",
    "the period of @xmath12 along @xmath13 axis is @xmath14 and the maximum of @xmath15 is @xmath16 we have previously demonstrated that a beam with the profile of ab at @xmath17 [ viz .",
    "@xmath18 will not die away when propagated according to the 1d nlse , but thanks to modulation instability and nonlinear interference it will display the nonlinear talbot effect @xcite .",
    "a question naturally arises , can this be generalized to 2d ?    even though various rogue wave solutions are reported for the 1d nlse @xcite , unfortunately there exist no analytical breather or periodic solutions of the 2d nlse",
    ". it would be nice if such an eigenfunction of 2d nlse exists in the transverse plane ; then it would be possible to check directly if it produces the 2d nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "since this is not the case , the next best possibility is to use the product of two 1d abs as a planar diffraction pattern , to see if it produces the effect .",
    "this product is not the solution of 2d nlse , nonetheless it is useful in investigating the nonlinear talbot effect . in a latter section , we discuss the possibility of obtaining nonlinear talbot effect from simpler periodic 2d inputs .",
    "thus , the incident wave for the 2d nlse is chosen in the form @xmath19 which is the product of two perpendicular 1d abs @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath22 is periodic both along @xmath13 and @xmath23 cooridinates .",
    "the periods along @xmath13 and @xmath23 directions are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . generally , @xmath26 , but if @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",

    "( [ akh2 ] ) makes the maximum amplitude equal to that of eq .",
    "( [ akh1 ] ) , if @xmath30 .",
    "note that the initial beam can be formed by other periodic functions in the transverse plane , not only by the product of two abs .",
    "however , we believe that not all periodic functions can be used to produce nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "we choose the product of two abs with @xmath17 , because ab is the solution of 1d nlse and exhibits convenient properties in comparison with other solutions @xcite , that is , it is periodic along both transverse coordinates and has a constant nonzero background .",
    "another solution of the cubic nlse that possesses similar properties is the doubly - periodic ab @xcite @xmath31 }   \\exp(iz),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for jacobian elliptic functions , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 . because @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are all periodic and the corresponding periods are @xmath40 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , with @xcite @xmath42 the solution described by eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is periodic along both @xmath13 and @xmath11 directions .",
    "the transverse period is @xmath43 as a result , one can also construct a viable initial 2d beam by using the product of two doubly - periodic abs at @xmath17 .    in the following sections , we study the propagation and dynamics of the product of two rogue waves , in both linear and nonlinear bulk media . we also consider talbot effect coming from simpler periodic inputs . to guarantee high numerical precision ,",
    "we utilize a fourth - order split - step fast fourier transform ( fft ) method @xcite in double precision . to make beams of finite energy and",
    "prevent fft spillover effects , we use an aperture with a diameter large enough to enforce fast convergence of beam intensity to zero at the transverse infinity .",
    "we discuss first the linear propagation equation [ that is , the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ nls1 ] ) is eliminated ] . using the separation of variables method ,",
    "one ends up with the following coupled equations @xcite :    @xmath44    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the separation constant . if we set @xmath47 and @xmath48 , eqs .",
    "( [ ceq1 ] ) and ( [ ceq2 ] ) can be recast into    @xmath49    @xmath50    which are the same as the 1d case investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the initial fields are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the 2d problem is reduced to the two independent 1d problems , which greatly decreases the complexity of the problem .",
    "the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ ceq3 ] ) and ( [ ceq4 ] ) have the same format , which can be written as @xcite @xmath53 \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{x}{z}\\xi\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 stands @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) describes the fresnel diffraction @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can obtain the analytical expressions of the talbot length corresponding to the two components @xcite , @xmath57 since the 2d linear talbot effect can be treated as a product of two independent 1d linear talbot effects , the talbot length of the 2d linear talbot effect would be the _ least common multiple _ of two 1d talbot lengths .",
    "in addition , based on eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) , the initial periodic beam can be arbitrary .",
    "therefore , we can investigate the linear talbot effect from a product of two abs , two doubly - periodic abs , or any other kind of periodic beams . in light of the formation being",
    "quite similar , for the linear case we only focus on the product of two abs with equal periods . for convenience , we set @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) we display the transverse intensity isosurface distribution of the propagating beam with @xmath61 , at different propagation distances .",
    "it is immediately seen that the incident rogue wave reappears at @xmath62 .",
    "this distance defines the talbot length @xmath63 . at @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    ", the fractional talbot images also form .",
    "similar to previous research @xcite , the fractional talbot image at @xmath65 exhibits a @xmath0 phase shift in comparison with the incidence , while for the @xmath64 fractional talbot image , the transverse period is halved . to see the talbot effect more clearly , we also plot the intensity carpet versus @xmath13 and @xmath11 in the plane @xmath66 , in fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the talbot images at @xmath64 and @xmath63 are quite apparent , while the one at @xmath65 is missing .",
    "the reason is that because of the @xmath0 phase shift , the talbot image at @xmath65 is shifted for half of the period transversely and can not be seen in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "supplementary material @xcite provides a clear animated 2d version of this propagation . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , the intensity profiles at @xmath17 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 along the @xmath70 axes are displayed . in conclusion ,",

    "( d ) relationships between @xmath75 and @xmath63 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . ]",
    "it is clear that the linear talbot effect does not change with different incident intensities .",
    "therefore , one can check the influence of @xmath76 ( also of the transverse period ) on the formation of linear talbot effect , even though the intensity of the incident beam changes with @xmath76 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , we display the relation between @xmath75 and talbot length , as shown by the solid curve and circles , which correspond to the analytical and numerical results , respectively .",
    "it is seen that these results agree with each other quite well .",
    "the same figure also displays the relationship of @xmath75 vs @xmath76 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath75 vs @xmath77 ( dash - dotted curve ) .      for a moment , let us go back to eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the integral can be viewed as a fourier transform of @xmath78 with the spatial frequency @xmath79 .",
    "at the talbot length @xmath63 , the initial beam is reproduced @xcite , i.e. , @xmath80 which means that the fourier transform of @xmath81 with the frequency @xmath82 is the initial beam @xmath83 .",
    "this result extends to the two - dimensional case straightforwardly .",
    "therefore , the talbot effect can be viewed as a _ self - fourier transform _ of input periodic beams that are periodically reconstructed during propagation .    at an arbitrary @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) can be scaled through variable substitution @xmath84 and @xmath85 , as @xmath86 \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{x'}{z_t}\\xi'\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a result , the fractional talbot effect is the self - fourier transform of the scaled transverse initial periodic beam .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scaling is equivalent to a @xmath0 phase shift at @xmath68 , due to the periodicity of the initial beam .",
    "in fact , the linear talbot effect can be interpreted as a _",
    "fractional _ self - fourier transform @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinear talbot effect can not be described as such , because it does not contain fractional images .",
    "the nonlinear talbot effect can be classified only as a regular self - fourier transform , in the sense that it only contains the original image at @xmath63 and the shifted original image at @xmath65 .",
    "this question will be addressed in the following section .",
    "when the nonlinearity is included , the practical problem is that the model can not be treated by the method of separation of variables . nonetheless ,",
    "following the same numerical procedure as in the linear case , the 2d nonlinear talbot effect can be investigated and demonstrated .",
    "we first take the product of two abs with equal transverse periods as the initial beam , then a product of two doubly - periodic abs , and at last a relatively simple periodic function .",
    "results for a product of abs are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which follows the same setup as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but with a perturbation added to the input beam .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the perturbation is @xmath87 of the product of abs .",
    "the perturbation is added to check the stability and robustness of the beams in propagation , which is necessary for nonlinear propagation . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we show the isosurface intensity plots that display the formation of 2d nonlinear talbot effect at @xmath61 .",
    "together with the isosurface plot , the intensities at certain distances are also shown .",
    "one striking difference with the linear talbot effect is immediately apparent : the fractional talbot images are gone .",
    "one can only observe the secondary and primary talbot images at @xmath65 and @xmath63 .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the 2d linear talbot effect .",
    "we also display the intensity carpet in the @xmath66 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , from which one can verify that there are no fractional talbot images .",
    "it is evident that in the propagation range @xmath88 $ ] a structure similar to the fractional talbot image appears , but this is not a fractional talbot image , because of the following reasons : ( 1 ) the transverse period is the same as that of the input ; ( 2 ) the position is not at @xmath89 .",
    "these structures are just the consequence of modulation instability .",
    "such images also exist in the range @xmath90 $ ] , however one can not see them in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) because the maximum is shifted from the plane @xmath66 , similar to the image at @xmath68 .",
    "more clear details about the nonlinear , as well as linear evolution of talbot images , can be seen in the movies provided in the supplemental material.(a ) and [ fig2](a ) . ]    , but for the 2d nonlinear talbot effect . ]",
    "the intensity profiles of the beam at @xmath17 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 along the @xmath70 axes are shown in fig . [ fig2](c ) .",
    "even though the intensity carpet in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) is not entirely symmetric about @xmath68 , the image at @xmath69 is the same as the input , and that at @xmath65 has a @xmath0 phase shift ( and is absent from the figure ) .",
    "the intensity profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) demonstrate the formation of the 2d nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "note that the modulation instability in the kerr nonlinear medium results in the formation of a 2d nonlinear talbot carpet that is not perfect  the intensity maximum is a bit smaller than that of the incidence and small humps appear between the neighboring peaks .",
    "however , the formation of 2d nonlinear talbot effect of rogue waves in bulk nonlinear medium is clearly demonstrated , because the required images at @xmath65 and @xmath63 appear .",
    "again , one should check the evolution displayed in the movie in the supplementary material @xcite , to ascertain the formation of 2d nonlinear talbot effect more convincingly .    since @xmath76 ( or the transverse period )",
    "is related to the intensity of the input beam and optical response of the nonlinear medium is sensitive to the beam intensity , the formation of 2d nonlinear talbot effect with different transverse periods will be much more complex than that of the 2d linear talbot effect . in fig . [",
    "fig2](d ) we show the changing trend of the talbot length versus the transverse period .",
    "the relationships between the transverse period and @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 are also displayed , which are similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "phenomenologically , the talbot length increases slowly with the increase in @xmath91 for @xmath92 , while for @xmath93 the relation is more steep . viewed as a whole ,",
    "the relation between @xmath91 and @xmath63 is parabolic .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained from a scaling point of view : rescaling transverse coordinates by a factor scales the longitudinal coordinate by the factor squared . in the linear case",
    "the relation can also be explained by the same scaling law , as depicted by eq .",
    "( [ tl ] ) .",
    "similar to the linear talbot effect , the nonlinear talbot effect can be also viewed as a self - fourier transform . at @xmath69 ,",
    "one obtains the initial beam , while at @xmath68 one obtains the same beam but transversely shifted . at other places ,",
    "the `` fourier transform '' still gives a periodic image , but it is different from the initial beam even when the transverse scaling is taken into account .",
    "hence , it can not be viewed as the fractional talbot effect .",
    "the nonlinear talbot effect proceeds from an initial beam to the fourier transform at @xmath68 ( which is the shifted beam ) and back to the original beam at @xmath69 .",
    "thus , it can be described as a genuine self - fourier transform .",
    "the amplitude of the incident 2d ab in eq .",
    "( [ akh2 ] ) can be adjusted by changing the value of @xmath94 , so we investigate numerically the relationship between the intensity and talbot length for the same transverse period .",
    "this is important because of the potential wave collapse in 2d .",
    "we fix @xmath76 ( by correspondingly fixing @xmath91 and @xmath95 ) and change the amplitude of the incident beam , to calculate the talbot length ; the results are depicted in fig .",
    "three values of @xmath76 are chosen , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , the bigger the @xmath76 , the larger the talbot length @xmath63 , so that in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the talbot length is the biggest when @xmath99 , for the same @xmath94 . with @xmath94 increasing ,",
    "the talbot length also increases , and such increment becomes quite fast when @xmath100 .",
    "the reason is that higher intensity leads to stronger modulation instability , which demands a longer distance to adjust itself during propagation .",
    "since the nonlinearity is kerr in nlse , the value of @xmath94 can not be chosen very high .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the propagation will collapse in a short distance when @xmath101 , even with a small perturbation .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that the beam will always collapse in such a medium when the propagation distance is long enough ; the occurrence of collapse does not depend of the value of @xmath94 only , but on the value of @xmath76 as well . choosing proper @xmath94 can only help us demonstrate nonlinear talbot effect over a relatively long distance  in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the beam could robustly propagate over 8 rayleigh lengths .",
    "finite longitudinal extension of the talbot effect is also a consequence of the finite transverse window over which the propagation is considered .",
    "the wider the window  the longer the carpet .",
    "the longitudinal periodicity of talbot images is the consequence of the transverse periodicity of input beams .",
    "finally , we touch upon the touchy subject of wave collapse .",
    "it is clear that the well - known `` catastrophic self - focusing collapse '' may occur in cubic nonlinear medium during the development of nonlinear talbot effect , i.e. , the beam will always collapse during propagation if the input power is high enough and the propagation distance long enough .",
    "therefore , to obtain a relatively stable recurrence , one should use not too high input intensity .",
    "an interesting topic would be to address the questions of threshold intensity and generally the stability of nonlinear talbot effect when different parameters in the model are varied .",
    "these questions , however are beyond the scope of this paper . to check for an eventual development of collapse",
    ", we only added a small amplitude perturbation to the initial beam .",
    "as mentioned , in numerical simulations we introduce white noise , whose maximum amplitude is up to @xmath87 of the input beam .",
    "we find that the figures reported in this paper remain the same .",
    "[ htbp ]   in the plane @xmath102 .",

    "the formation of the 2d talbot effect from a product of two doubly periodic abs is evident . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , we display the intensity evolution in the plane @xmath102 , so as to depict the generation of the talbot carpet clearly .",
    "we can see that the beam is robust in propagation over such a long distance , even though the perturbation is included .",

    "what about the simpler periodic initial conditions ?",
    "is rogue wave a necessary condition ? to answer these questions , we construct a transversely periodic and longitudinally localized beam as follows @xmath104 which possesses a nonzero background . by making a product of @xmath105 and @xmath106 ,",

    "[ fig4 ] . ]",
    "the propagation of the input ( [ cosine ] ) with a small perturbation ( the maximum amplitude @xmath109 of the input ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . from the figure",
    "one can see that the nonlinear talbot recurrence forms during propagation ( at @xmath110 ) , even though the peak intensity increases with the distance .",
    "it is also seen that the nonlinear talbot effect still does not exhibit the fractional talbot images , and that the evolution is similar to those shown in waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that a rogue wave solution is not a necessary condition to realize nonlinear talbot effect . in other words , nonlinear , as well as linear , talbot effect",
    "is not limited to very specific initial conditions .    on the other hand , if @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ cosine ] ) is chosen as a simple 2d pattern @xmath111 , one can not realize the nonlinear talbot effect ( not shown here ) . therefore , one can say that not only rogue wave solution is not a necessary condition , but also the initial condition can not be an arbitrary 2d periodic pattern .",
    "the common condition is that the input should be constructed from periodic functions with nonzero background , as displayed in eqs .",
    "( [ akh1 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ cosine_input ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the 2d nonlinear talbot effect theoretically and displayed the effect numerically , for the first time to the best of our knowledge . for the effect to be seen ,",

    "thus , the 2d talbot effect results in the formation of 3d periodic optical structures . different from the 2d linear talbot effect , there are no fractional talbot images in the 2d nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "numerical experiments demonstrate that the smaller the transverse period and the smaller the amplitude of the incident beam , the shorter the talbot length in 2d nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations also demonstrate that a rogue wave solution is not a necessary condition for the realization of the 2d nonlinear talbot effect .",
    "it may be realized from other , simpler periodic inputs , but with a general requirement that they possess a finite background .",
    "last but not least , talbot effect can be viewed as self - fourier transform of the initial periodic beams occurring during propagation . we hope that our research has broadened up the potential applications of talbot effect  in particular , for possible fabrication of 3d photonic crystals  and has deepened the understanding of rogue waves .",
