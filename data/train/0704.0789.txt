    "the evolution of stars in close binary systems leads to interesting stellar end - products such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , type 1a supernovae , and helium  core white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "the period in which an evolved star ascends the asymptotic giant branch and engulfs a close companion in its evolving atmosphere , referred to as the common envelope phase , probably plays a dominant role in the evolution of these systems and as yet is poorly understood .",
    "the angular momentum of the system is believed to aid in the eventual ejection of the common envelope to reveal the remnant wd and close companion .",

    "limited samples like the palomar  green @xcite .",
    "however , the same paper notes that magnetic wds may generally have smaller radii than non  magnetic white dwarfs , due to higher mass . in a given volume , the density of magnetic wds may be @xmath3% of all wds @xcite .",
    "the sdss is also a magnitude limited sample so we assume a similar expected value for the close binaries . our sample ( as discussed in detail in  2 ) contains 1253 potential close binary systems",

    "possible implications of the small radii for magnetic wd + main sequence pairs will be discussed in  5 . however , more than 25% of the wds in the currently identified cv population are classified as magnetic , and many have magnetic fields in excess of 10 mg ( see * ? ? ?",

    "as discussed by @xcite , this implies essentially no overlap between the close binary and magnetic wd samples .    a new class of short  period , low accretion  rate polars ( larps ) identified by @xcite may explain , in part , these `` missing '' magnetic wd systems . in these systems , the donor star has not filled its roche lobe . the wd accretes material by capturing the stellar wind of the secondary .",

    "more close binaries are being targeted in the sdss  ii ( segue ) survey which will continue to increase the sample through 2008 .",
    "the list of 1253 potential close binary systems given in table  [ wdmcat ] includes objects from all plates released with the public dr5 , thereby superseding the s06 dr4 catalog .",
    "the technique used to search for these objects is the same as described in s06 . as with that study , we do not include systems with low signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n @xmath12 ) and do not search for systems with non  da wds .",
    "we emphasize that our sample is not complete ( or bias free ) due to the selection effects imposed by our detection methods and due to the sporadic targeting of these objects in the sdss spectroscopic survey as discussed in s06 .",
    "thus , our sample represents primarily bright , da  wd  +  m dwarf binary systems . as evidenced by @xcite",

    "it is possible that some of these pairs may contain a magnetic wd ; however , much higher s / n spectra are required to adequately characterize the blue component of these systems .",
    "similarly , the thirty nine objects identified as wd+ : or wd+:e ( see figure  8 of s06 ) have either some excess flux in the red or have emission at balmer wavelengths indicative of a faint , active , low  mass or sub  stellar companion . the companion to the magnetic wd in @xcite was first identified by emission at h@xmath16  in the sdss discovery spectrum .",
    "other than the emission at h@xmath16  this object had no other optical signature of a companion .",

    "most are classical wd  +  m dwarf close binaries as shown in figure  [ example ] . of interest",
    "are the lower quality spectra , where the features of the wd are less obvious because of low s / n and/or contamination by the spectral features of the close m dwarf companion .",
    "these effects make it difficult to identify small magnetic field effects on the wd absorption features .",
    "thus , relatively low magnetic fields ( @xmath19 mg ) are not easily recognized in the combined spectrum .",
    "given the difficulties associated with visually identifying features in these systems , we developed a method to search for the characteristic zeeman splitting of the da wd absorption features that is also sensitive to low magnetic field wds .",
    "we use a program that attempts to match absorption features in magnetic da wd models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for details on the models ) through an iterative method of smoothing and searching the stellar spectrum . to develop a robust program to search for magnetic wds in close binaries we first tested our program on wds of known magnetic field strength",
    "we used the magnetic da wds with field strengths between 1.5 mg @xmath20 mg from @xcite and @xcite as our test sample .",
    "we then constructed model spectra at every half  mg between 1.5 mg @xmath21 mg , each with magnetic field inclinations of 30 , 60 , and 90 .",
    "the program was able to match ( using a @xmath22 minimization ) the magnetic field strength of each of the magnetic wds to within @xmath23 mg of the value quoted in @xcite .",
    "we then constructed a sample of simulated sdss spectra of magnetic binary systems .",
    "the simulated binaries were created by adding the spectra of magnetic wds used in our initial test from @xcite and @xcite to the m star templates of @xcite .",
    "we first normalized all spectra at a wavelength of 6500  , and then combined them with flux ratios of 1:4 ( wd : m dwarf ) to 4:1 to replicate the range of flux ratios observed in the close binary sample ( see figure  [ comp ] ) .",
    "in reality the sdss spectra extend to below 3900   and to nearly 10000  . ] .",
    "this created a sample of binaries which represent the average brightness and spectral type distribution of the majority of the systems in table  [ wdmcat ] ( i.e. da wds and m0m5 dwarfs ) .",
    "figure  [ fake ] is an example of one of the simulated magnetic binary systems .",
    "the upper left hand panel is the sdss spectrum of a 13 mg magnetic wd , the upper right hand panel is the spectrum of a template m4 dwarf star .",
    "the bottom panel is the addition ( superposition ) of the two spectra with a flux ratio of 1:1 at 6500  .",
    "as shown , this wd with a relatively moderate magnetic field , when combined with the spectrum of an average m dwarf , is clearly detected at the resolution of the sdss spectra ( r @xmath24 ) .",
    "we found that detecting the presence of a wd magnetic field depends most strongly on the spectral type and relative flux of the m dwarf companion .",
    "due to the selection effects of the close binary sample ( see s06 for details ) , the majority of the m dwarfs in these binaries have spectral sub ",
    "types between m0m4 . in sdss spectra ,",
    "early m dwarf spectral types contribute nearly as much flux in the blue portion of the spectrum ( 40007000  ) as they do in the red ( 700010000  ) .",
    "the spectrum of the blue magnetic wd is then superimposed onto the numerous blue molecular features of the m dwarf .",
    "this makes the small absorption features stemming from the subtle influence of a weak magnetic field difficult to detect .",
    "we plot a subset of our simulated pairs to demonstrate some of these issues in figure  [ earlymwd ] and figure  [ latemwd ] .",
    "in figure  [ earlymwd ] we selected four early  type template m dwarfs ( wd+m0 = open squares , wd+m1 = open circles , wd+m2 = open triangles , and wd+m3 = crosses ) from @xcite and added them to a range of magnetic wds from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the quoted value from @xcite for the magnetic field strength of each of these wds represents the `` literature @xmath25 '' value on the x  axis .",
    "the `` measured @xmath25 '' is the value returned by the program .",
    "values returned by the program that matched the literature values fall along the solid line .",
    "the dashed lines represent @xmath23 mg of the literature value .",
    "figure  [ latemwd ] is the same except we add the same magnetic wds to later  type m dwarf templates ( wd+m4 = open squares , wd+m5 = open circles , wd+m6 = open triangles , and wd+m7 = crosses ) .",
    "the solid triangles represent the tests using the isolated wd spectra .    in both figures",
    "[ earlymwd ] and [ latemwd ] the program returns the value of the single wd to within @xmath26 mg for the large majority of the systems .",
    "the uncertainty of the fitted value and the spread in values increases for magnetic fields of 3 mg or less when the magnetic wd is paired with an m dwarf of comparable brightness .",
    "the flux minima associated with the zeeman features for such low field strengths are just barely resolvable in high s / n spectra of isolated sdss wds ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". the added complexity of the m dwarf molecular features and the generally lower s / n spectra make it difficult to measure the magnetic features for low magnetic field strengths . however , wds with magnetic fields @xmath27",
    "mg were easily measured at all m dwarf spectral types .    in both figures , the largest discrepancies between the literature and measured values occur when the wd s magnetic field is between 12 mg @xmath28 mg ; this is true when the wd is paired with both early and late ",
    "type m dwarfs .",
    "inspection of the model results indicates that at these field strengths , the zeeman features overlap on wavelengths with strong m dwarf molecular features , causing confusion in the identification of the feature .",
    "however , wd spectra with these and larger field strengths are quite easily recognized visually so we are confident that no systems with @xmath29 mg have escaped notice , though the exact value of the field strength would be more uncertain .    in figure  [ abg ] , we demonstrate the effect of the relative flux ratio ( wd : m dwarf [ dm ] ) on the identification of the magnetic field strength of wds in the simulated binary sample .",
    "the figure gives the relative flux ratio versus the difference between the magnetic fields quoted in the literature and those returned by the program .",
    "we use the same @xmath25 distribution in figure  [ abg ] as used in figure  [ earlymwd ] and figure  [ latemwd ] .",
    "the literature values ( @xmath30 ) are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the three panels show ratios determined using h@xmath16  ( top ) , h@xmath31(center ) , and h@xmath32  ( bottom ) .",
    "the program consistently returns the quoted @xmath25 as determined from h@xmath31  until the flux contribution from the m dwarf is nearly double the flux contribution from the wd",
    ". the program returns the magnetic field from the h@xmath16feature to within @xmath23 mg until the flux contribution from the m dwarf is nearly 1.5@xmath33 the flux from the wd .",
    "the @xmath25 as measured by h@xmath32  is consistently 1525 mg larger than the @xmath25 value in the literature at any flux ratio .",
    "the contribution of a relatively clean spectral region near h@xmath31 , together with the fairly strong zeeman signal at this wavelength makes h@xmath31  a reliable indicator of wd magnetic field strength for binaries with flux ratios up to 1:2 .",
    "the method employed by s06 to split the binary system into its two component spectra through an iterative method of fitting and subtracting wd model atmospheres and template m dwarf spectra was not used on these objects .",
    "there are no obviously strong magnetic wds in the sample , suggesting that any possibly magnetic wds must possess relatively weak fields .",
    "the subsequent fitting and subtraction of model wds and template m dwarfs adds noise to the spectrum which would make detection of an already weak magnetic field even more difficult .",
    "also , we would be subtracting a non  magnetic wd model from the spectrum of a potentially magnetic wd in our attempt to improve the m dwarf template fit .",
    "this adds absorption features where none actually exist , further corrupting the wd spectrum .",
    "given these complications , we chose to work with the original composite sdss discovery spectra .",
    "table  [ maybemags ] lists the properties of the only two close binary systems flagged by our program as containing potential magnetic wds : sdss j082828.18 + 471737.9 and sdss j125250.03@xmath34020608.1 .",

    "the best fit model for sdss j082828.18 + 471737.9 has a magnetic field strength of 8 mg and an inclination of 90 , while the best fit model for sdss j125250.03@xmath34020608.1 has a magnetic field strength of 3 mg and an inclination of 90 .",
    "h@xmath31  appears to be distorted in both systems , indicating a potential broadening of a few mg field , however h@xmath32  and h@xmath36 would show more splitting than h@xmath31 but both appear to be relatively sharp in comparison .",
    "h@xmath31may be affected by tio features from the m dwarf and there does appear to be a minor glitch in the blue portion of the spectrum , indication difficulty with sdss flux calibration .",
    "of the 1253 potential close binary systems in the dr5 catalog , there were 168 systems that we could not measure with our program .",

    "our automatic detection methods are sensitive to magnetic fields between 3 mg @xmath37 30 mg ; field strengths larger than this are easily identified by visual inspection . therefore , there is a significant shortage of close binary systems that could be the progenitors of the large intermediate  polar and polar cv populations .    as mentioned in  1 , @xcite discuss six newly identified low accretion rate magnetic binary systems as being the probable progenitors to magnetic cvs .",

    "these objects are clearly pre - polars and provide an obvious link between post  common envelope , detached binaries and polars .",
    "the existence of these objects , however only adds to the mystery .",
    "if observations of these objects are possible then why have no detached binary systems with large magnetic field wds been detected ?",
    "perhaps selection effects are to blame .",
    "@xcite discuss the various selection effects associated with targeting these pre  polars with the sdss .",
    "as is the case with the majority of the close binary systems , the pre  polars were targeted by the sdss qso targeting pipeline @xcite which accounts for the narrow range of magnetic field strengths found in these objects . in the case of significantly lower or higher magnetic field strengths , the pre ",
    "polars resemble an ordinary wd  +  m dwarf binary in color  color space and are rejected by the qso targeting algorithm .",
    "it is possible that this selection effect accounts for the lack of close binary magnetic systems targeted by the sdss as well . arguing against this explanation is the large number of detached close binary systems in our sample , and the fact that the pre  polars were observed by the sdss .",
    "it is quite surprising that a detached system with a wd magnetic field in the range required to detect these pre  polars has not been observed , if such objects exist .",
    "another selection effect discussed by @xcite argues that magnetic wds , on average , are more massive than non  magnetic wds ; this implies smaller wd radii and therefore less luminous wds .",
    "faint , massive wds in competition with the flux from an m star companion might go undetected in an optical survey because they are hidden by the more luminous , non  degenerate companion .",
    "this would imply an unusually small mass ratio ( q = m2/m1 ) for the initial binary if the progenitor of the magnetic white dwarf were massive ( 3 - 8 m@xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , the magnetics may usually have been paired with an a - g star . however , the vast majority of polars and intermediate polars with strongly magnetic primaries have m dwarf companions .",
    "perhaps they were whittled down from more massive stars by mass transfer .",
    "the larps are selected for spectroscopy because of their peculiar colors , which arise because of the isolated cyclotron harmonics .",
    "as @xcite point out , the wds in larps are generally rather faint ( cool ) and , in one case , undetected .",
    "so the large mass / small radius selection effect would also apply to the pre  polars which have been observed by sdss .",
    "we present a new sample of close binary systems through the data release five of the sdss .",
    "this catalog includes more than 1200 wd  +  m dwarf binary systems and represents the largest catalog of its kind to date .",
