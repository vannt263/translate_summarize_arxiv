    "it is widely known that special functions constitute invaluable mathematical tools in most fields of natural sciences and engineering . in the area of telecommunications",
    ", their utilization often allows the derivation of elegant closed - form representations for important performance measures such as error probability , channel capacity and higher - order statistics ( hos ) .",
    "the computational realization of such expressions is typically straightforward since most special functions are built - in in popular mathematical software packages such as maple , matlab and mathematica . among others ,",
    "the marcum @xmath0function , @xmath2 , the nuttall @xmath0function , @xmath3 and the incomplete toronto function ( itf ) , @xmath4 were proposed several decades ago and have been involved in analytic solutions of various scenarios in information and communication theory .",
    "more specifically , marcum @xmath0function was firstly proposed by marcum in @xcite but it became widely known in digital communications , over fading or non - fading media , by the contributions in @xcite .",
    "its traditional and generalized form are denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and their properties and identities were presented in @xcite .",
    "respective upper and lower bounds were reported in @xcite while an exponential integral representation was proposed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , useful closed - form representation for the @xmath6 function for the special case that the order @xmath7 is an positive odd multiple of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 , were derived in @xcite .",
    "likewise , the nuttall @xmath0function is a special function that emerges from the generalization of the marcum @xmath0function @xcite .",
    "its definition is given by a semi - infinite integral representation and it can be expressed in terms of @xmath6 and the modified bessel function of the first kind , @xmath10 , for the special case that the sum @xmath11 is an odd integer @xcite .",
    "establishment of monotonicity criteria for @xmath12 along with the derivation of tight lower and upper bounds and a closed - form expression for the case that @xmath13 and @xmath14 were reported in @xcite . in the same context ,",
    "the incomplete toronto function is a similar special function which was proposed by hatley in @xcite .",
    "it is a generalization of the toronto function , @xmath15 , and includes the @xmath2 function as a special case .",
    "its definition is also given in non - infinite integral form while alternative representations include two infinite series @xcite .",
    "its application has been used in studies relating to statistics , signal detection and estimation , radar systems and error probability analysis @xcite .    nevertheless , in spite of the evident importance of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 functions , they are not adequately tabulated while they are not included as standard built - in functions in popular software packages .",
    "motivated by this , the authors in @xcite derived explicit expressions for the @xmath3 and @xmath16 functions .",
    "specifically , a closed - form expression for @xmath3 was derived in @xcite for the specific case that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a similar expression for the @xmath19 was subsequently derived in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simple series representations for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 functions were derived in @xcite .",
    "these series are particularly useful since their algebraic form is relatively simple , which render the functions convenient to handle analytically .",
    "however , their form is infinite and thus the determination of adequate truncation needs to be taken into consideration for ensuring acceptable levels of accuracy for any given application .",
    "motivated by this , this work is devoted to the derivation of novel upper bounds for the truncation error of the above functions .",
    "the derived representations are expressed in closed - form and have a relatively simple algebraic form .",
    "in addition , simple upper bounds are derived in closed - form , which are shown to be quite tight and in certain cases they become remarkably accurate closed - form approximations .",

    "for the special case that @xmath26 it follows that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath7 and @xmath29 are integers , the following recursion equation was reported in ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , an efficient way that will determine effectively after how many terms the above series can be truncated without loss of accuracy , is undoubtedly necessary .",
    "the accuracy of is proportional to the value of @xmath49 and the series converges quickly .",
    "however , deriving a convenient closed - form expression that is capable of determining the involved truncation error analytically is particularly advantageous .    for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the following closed - form upper bound for the truncation error holds ,    @xmath52    @xmath53    where ,    @xmath54^{l + 1 } \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{l + 1}{2 } , \\frac{(b - a)^{2}}{2 } \\right )    \\right\\rbrace , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath55    denoting the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "the truncation error of is expressed as ,    @xmath56    which can be equivalently expressed as    @xmath57    as already mentioned , since the series in @xmath58 tends to infinity , the terms @xmath59 vanish , yielding    @xmath60    it is recalled that the normalized nuttall @xmath20-function can be upper bounded by ( * ? ? ?",
