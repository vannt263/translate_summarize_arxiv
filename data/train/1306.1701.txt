    "thermodynamic properties of gauge theories are of common interest in various fields of physics  @xcite , including the baryogenesis and leptogenesis , the physics of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , neutrinos physics in big - bang nucleosynthesis and in compact stars , and many others .",
    "a novel ingredient in the dynamics at finite temperature ( @xmath0 ) is due to the existence of thermally excited particles , with which a probe particle is scattered in the classical level , leading to a damping known as landau damping and a modification of the spectral properties of the probe particle . in this paper , partly motivated by the recent development of the resonant leptogenesis scenario @xcite , we study the spectral properties of neutrinos at finite @xmath0 , specifically in the electroweak - scale , in a way where the gauge ( in)dependence is manifestly checked .    although the standard model ( sm ) seems to fail to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , an extension of the sm by adding right - handed majorana neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) may have a chance to account for the bau .",
    "indeed , a thermal leptogenesis scenario based on such an extended model @xcite gives a simple and promising account of the bau . in this scenario ,",
    "a decay of @xmath5 out of equilibrium via yukawa interactions generates a net lepton number , which is partially converted into the baryon numbers through sphaleron processes @xcite in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "furthermore , if the mass difference between two right - handed neutrinos is on the order of their @xmath6-violating decay width , the @xmath6 asymmetry is dynamically enhanced and so is leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "this resonant leptogenesis scenario implies that @xmath5 with a tev - scale or electroweak - scale mass is relevant to the bau and thus has opened a possibility to create a lepton number at electroweak - scale temperature .    ) , width=113 ]    to a standard model lepton @xmath7 and a standard model higgs doublet @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : nr_decay ]    figure  [ fig : nr_decay ] shows the @xmath6-violating decay process of @xmath5 , which gives one of the most important contributions to lepton number creation , where both the higgs particle and leptons are involved . in the present work , we suppose that the relevant processes occur at finite @xmath0 of the electroweak - scale . in this @xmath0 region , the following two finite-@xmath0 effects come into play : 1 )  the landau damping of the higgs particle and leptons by thermally excited particles including massive gauge bosons ; 2 )  the @xmath0 dependence of the masses of the involved particles , generated by the englert - brout - higgs - guralnik - hagen - kibble mechanism @xcite , which will be called simply the higgs mechanism from now on in this paper . if the standard model leptons have nontrivial spectral properties due to the aforementioned two effects , lepton number creation via the @xmath5 decay in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr_decay ] will be significantly modified .    the important role of the landau damping for modifying the fermion spectral properties is known and established in qed and qcd in the context of qgp physics .",
    "a fermion interacting with thermally excited gauge bosons and antifermion admits a novel collective excitation mode known as a ( an anti ) plasmino as well as the normal quasiparticle excitation with thermal mass @xcite .",
    "such collective excitations in the qgp at extremely high @xmath0 are shown to exist and their dispersion relations are obtained in a gauge - invariant way , at least at one - loop order , which is now known as the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation @xcite .",
    "a full spectral property beyond the dispersion relations of massive electrons in qed plasma is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a physical account of the interplay between the electron - mass and temperature - effects that leads to a landau damping were presented .    as first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect that the leptons appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr_decay ] should also admit nontrivial collective excitations at finite @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the neutrino spectral properties at electroweak - scale temperature in the broken phase have been investigated by using the htl approximation in the unitary gauge @xcite .",
    "a remarkable finding there was the possible existence of a novel branch of the dispersion relation with a collective nature in the ultrasoft - energy region . here , an important question is whether such an ultrasoft mode is physically significant with regards to the gauge invariance , which can not be checked within the unitary gauge .",
    "in fact , the gauge ( in)dependence of the spectral properties of neutrinos in the ultrasoft - energy region has not been fully investigated yet , except for those at @xmath9@xmath10 mev  @xcite .    here",
    ", we note that the gauge ( in)dependence of the spectral properties of massless fermions ( quarks ) in the ultrasoft - energy region has been discussed in the physics of qgp .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the spectral function of massless quarks coupled to massive vector soft modes in qgp can have a novel peak in the ultrasoft - energy region as well as those corresponding to the normal and the antiplasmino modes , and it was later demonstrated  @xcite that their properties are gauge independent by using the stueckelberg formalism  @xcite .",
    "now , one should recognize that the relevant ingredients for the description of hot neutrinos at the electroweak - scale temperature are the same as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ , a massless fermion and a massive vector boson with a mass comparable with @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a natural and intriguing question is whether the neutrino spectral density at @xmath0 of the electroweak - scale should also develop a three - peak or three - bump structure including an ultrasoft mode without gauge dependence , as quarks do in the qgp @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate in a gauge - invariant way the spectral properties of neutrinos at weak coupling , without restricting ourselves to their dispersion relations , in the full energy - momentum plane at finite @xmath0 around the electroweak - scale .",
    "we show that the neutrino develops an ultrasoft excitation mode as well as the normal and plasmino ones without recourse to the htl approximation .",
    "we shall employ the @xmath1 gauge  @xcite for examining the possible gauge - fixing dependence of the spectral density in both broken and symmetric phases .",
    "furthermore , we also discuss the implications of the resulting neutrino spectral properties to the cosmology by considering the electroweak - scale resonant leptogenesis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",

    "@xcite , the absence of the first - order transition indicates that the weak - boson masses in electroweak plasma @xmath3 smoothly go to zero .",
