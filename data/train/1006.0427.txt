    "quantum scattering of strongly interacting few - nucleon systems is complicated and requires careful treatment of asymptotics , antisymmetrization effects as well as the dynamics generated by nuclear forces .",
    "full treatments of antisymmetrization with correlations have become routine in bound - state and quasi - bound - state solutions of light nuclei using _ ab - initio _ techniques based on nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) and three - nucleon interactions ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "techniques , such as the no core shell model ( ncsm ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the coupled cluster ( cc ) approach ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are used to calculate ground and excited states of light nuclei .",
    "the precision of these calculations has reached a point where further progress is now limited by the fidelity of the input interactions .    in reaction calculations of scattering properties of light nuclei",
    ", progress has been less pronounced , though nonetheless significant .",
    "r - matrix analysis ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) has been historically the empirical workhorse , providing impressive fits to a range of experimental data .",
    "more microscopic approaches to the scattering of light nuclei are based on the resonating group method ( rgm )  @xcite .",
    "a promising avenue for _ ab - initio _ calculations of scattering of light ions comes from the coupling of the rgm reaction method with the ncsm bound - state technique  @xcite . for this method , the large computational resources required to achieve convergence provide the limiting constraint on reliably calculating scattering parameters for processes with @xmath5",
    ". it would be significant if existing bound - state techniques , and their accompanying precision , could be further exploited to reliably determine scattering amplitudes for multi - nucleon systems .    during the last twenty years",
    "the general technique of effective field theory ( eft ) has been developed and applied to multi - nucleon systems .",
    "effective field theory provides a description of observables , consistent with the approximate chiral symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , in terms of a small number of expansion parameters within a plane - wave basis .",
    "these expansion parameters are used to relate the experimentally determined scattering parameters and bound - state properties of few - nucleon systems to the coefficients of operators at a given order in the eft expansion . in principle , this allows for systematically improvable calculations of multi - nucleon observables . applying the eft framework within an oscillator basis has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that the eft framework might be fruitfully applied to multi - fermion systems confined in a harmonic potential  @xcite , and might be usefully married with the ncsm calculational scheme . in ref .  @xcite it was suggested that the scattering properties of certain complex nuclear systems could be calculated from the spectrum of the same systems confined to a harmonic potential .",
    "this was demonstrated for two confined particles at the unitary limit in ref .",
    "a lattice formulation of eft coupled with an external harmonic potential is currently being developed  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the simple two - nucleon system confined in a harmonic potential of the form @xmath6 , and interacting via nuclear forces in uncoupled partial waves . since two - body techniques are well established for both scattering and bound states , this system is ideal for determining the extent to which continuum scattering amplitudes can be recovered from bound - state information . an analytic expression that relates the eigenvalues of two interacting particles moving in a harmonic potential to the scattering phase shift at those energies , analogous to `` lschers method ''  @xcite that is used in lattice qcd , allows for the scattering phase shift to be determined in the limit that the oscillator length is large compared to the range of nuclear forces . as the latter is characterized by the compton wavelength of the pion , with increasing confinement this leads to modifications to nuclear forces due to the harmonic potential that must be systematically removed in order to accurately predict the scattering amplitude .",
    "this is achieved by calculating the energy - eigenvalues over a range of harmonic frequencies , @xmath7 , determining the scattering amplitude over this range of @xmath7 , and then extrapolating to the @xmath8 limit .",
    "we verify the extracted phase shifts by comparing them to the results of an independent scattering calculation .",
    "the two methods are found to yield the same phase shifts within the uncertainties of the calculations .",
    "it is well - established that the energy - eigenvalues of an interacting system of particles confined to a finite volume can be used to determine the scattering phase shift ( at the energy - eigenvalues ) when the size of the confining region is much larger than the range of the interactions between the particles .",
    "for instance , relating the scattering phase shift to the energy - eigenvalues of two - nucleons confined to a spherical region by solving the schr@xmath9dinger equation with a dirichlet boundary condition is a problem that appears in standard texts on nuclear physics , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this method has been successfully employed in the latticization of low - energy eft s to predict ( to a given level of precision ) the ground state energies of light nuclei and their volume dependence  @xcite .",
    "volume dependence is also used to determine meson - meson , meson - baryon and baryon - baryon elastic scattering phase shifts from the energy - eigenvalues of these systems calculated with lattice qcd   ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "lattice qcd calculations are generally performed in spatial volumes with cubic symmetry and with periodic boundary - conditions ( bc s ) imposed upon the fields at the edges .",
    "this reduces the number of momentum modes , and hence reduces the kinetic - energy contributions to the calculated processes .",
    "the non - relativistic relation between the energy - eigenvalues and the scattering amplitude ( the `` lscher relation '' ) has been shown to be valid even in quantum field theory  @xcite . given the energy - splitting , @xmath10 , between the two - hadron state and the hadron masses , @xmath11 , the real part of the inverse scattering amplitude below inelastic thresholds is @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the energy - dependent phase - shift , and the limit @xmath15 is implicit .",
    "the @xmath16-function is the green function , @xmath17 , for two - hadron plane - wave eigenstates ( and straightforwardly generalizes to hadrons with different masses ) .",

    "corrections to the relation are found to behave as @xmath19 , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "if , in the continuum ( infinite - volume ) limit , a system contains a shallow bound state , as is the case in the nn @xmath20-@xmath21 coupled channel , the periodic bc in a finite volume increases the binding energy of the state .",
    "the finite - volume corrections scale as @xmath22  @xcite , where @xmath23 is the binding momentum in the continuum .",
    "in contrast , the continuum scattering states have power - law dependences upon the lattice extent for @xmath24 , with energies that behave as @xmath25 for the ground state and @xmath26 for the higher - energy states .",
    "the systems that we considered in this work are comprised of two nucleons in a harmonic potential ( with oscillator frequency @xmath7 ) interacting through nn forces .",
    "we will consider the jisp16 potential  @xcite , which reproduces the low - energy nn scattering data with a @xmath27 , but our results are general and the technique can be applied to other nn interactions .",
