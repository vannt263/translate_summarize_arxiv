    "furthermore , in the susy grand unified theories the unification of the standard gauge couplings can be realized .",
    "however , overviewing the cosmology of the susy model , we are faced with various difficulties .",
    "one of the cosmological problems is the gravitino problem @xcite .",
    "this problem still exists even if the universe experienced a primordial inflation , since the gravitino is reproduced by scatterings with particles in the thermal bath at the reheating epoch . in the hidden sector susy breaking ( hssb ) models @xcite",
    "the gravitino has a mass of the order of the electroweak scale : @xmath4@xmath5 gev , and it decays soon after the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . since high energy photons produced by the gravitino decay might destroy the light elements ( d , @xmath6he , @xmath7he ) synthesized by the bbn , the reheating temperature of the primordial inflation should be low enough not to conflict with the observations ( e.g. , see a recent analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite predict a light gravitino of mass @xmath8  ev@xmath9 gev .",
    "if the gravitino mass is @xmath10kev @xcite , a low enough reheating temperature of the inflation is also required to avoid the overclosure by the stable gravitino @xcite .    furthermore ,",
    "when one considers the susy models in the framework of the superstring theories @xcite , they suffer from a more serious problem , i.e. , `` cosmological moduli problem '' @xcite . as a general consequence of the superstring theories , various dilaton and modulus fields appear .",
    "( we call them as `` moduli '' throughout this paper . )",
    "these moduli fields @xmath11 are expected to acquire masses of the order of the gravitino mass ( @xmath12 ) from nonperturbative effects of the susy breaking @xcite . their lifetimes ,",
    "since they have only the gravitationally suppressed interaction , are roughly estimated as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the number of the decay channels and @xmath15 is the planck scale @xmath16 gev .",
    "the existence of moduli @xmath11 with such long lifetimes leads to various cosmological difficulties , because a large number of moduli particles are produced as the coherent oscillations after the primordial inflation . in the hssb models",
    "@xmath11 decay soon after the bbn as the gravitino , and hence the light elements might also be destroyed @xcite . on the other hand , for the lighter stable moduli predicted by the gmsb models ,",
    "say @xmath17 mev , the energy of the oscillation lasting until the present overcloses the universe .",
    "moreover , moduli with masses @xmath18  mev@xmath9 gev give too much contributions to the x(@xmath19)-ray background spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore , moduli particles typically predicted by both hssb and gmsb models bring a cosmological disaster .    one way to evade these difficulties due to the string moduli is to give heavy masses ( @xmath20 tev ) to all moduli , so that the decays of moduli take place before the bbn @xcite and the lightest superparticles produced by the moduli decays do not overclose the universe @xcite .",
    "although a large entropy is produced by the moduli decay , the present observed baryon asymmetry can be naturally explained by the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite as shown in ref .",
    "however , such heavy moduli masses ( i.e. , a heavy gravitino mass ) could be only achieved by some specific models .    here",
    "we would like to emphasize that this cosmological moduli problem could not be solved by the primordial inflation , even if one assumed an extremely low reheating temperature about 10 mev which is limited from below by the bbn observation .",
    "this is a crucial difference from the gravitino problem .",
    "therefore , we require some extra mechanism other than the primordial inflation to dilute the moduli mass density sufficiently .",
    "one of such dilution mechanisms is the thermal inflation model proposed by lyth and stewart @xcite .",
    "the thermal inflation occurs before the electroweak phase transition and produces tremendous entropy ( just ) before the bbn epoch , which leads to sufficient dilution of the moduli density . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the moduli problem in the hssb models can be solved by the thermal inflation .",
    "on the other hand , the attempts to solve the problem in the gmsb models by the thermal inflation were done in refs .",
    "it was shown by ref . @xcite",
    "that it can solve the overclosure problem for the stable moduli whose masses are @xmath1  ev@xmath21 gev .",
    "however , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the stringent x(@xmath19)-ray background constraint was found to exclude the modulus mass region @xmath22@xmath9 gev .",
    "thus the thermal inflation can cure a part of the cosmological difficulties of the string moduli predicted by both hssb and gmsb models .    however , most of previous works ( except ref .",
    "@xcite ) assumed that the reheating process of the primordial inflation be completed before the moduli oscillations start , i.e. , only the inflation models with relatively high reheating temperatures were considered . even in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reheating process is assumed to end before the thermal inflation starts . without this restriction",
    "one might obtain wider allowed region for the modulus mass . in this paper , therefore , we make a comprehensive study whether the thermal inflation can solve cosmological problem of the moduli particles with masses @xmath1  ev@xmath2  gev ( i.e. , the whole modulus mass region predicted by both hssb and gmsb models ) , especially taking into account the inflation model whose reheating temperature is low enough so that its reheating process finishes after the thermal inflation ends .",

    "[ sec - mpmti ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec - dis ] , we discuss two extra problems when one assumes the tremendous entropy production enough to dilute the string moduli , i.e. , problems of baryogenesis and dark matter .",
    "we find that the problem of the baryon asymmetry is so serious that we have only two possible solution so far ; ( i ) sufficient baryons can be generated through the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite for the modulus mass region @xmath26 mev and ( ii ) for @xmath27@xmath2 gev the electroweak baryogenesis can produce the present observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "first of all , we explain the cosmological difficulties due to the string moduli particles . in the following analysis",
    "we assume only one modulus field , @xmath11 , with the mass @xmath28 to derive the conservative constraints , although we can easily extend the analysis for more general cases .",
    "after the primordial inflation ends , the modulus field @xmath11 is considered to be displaced from the true minimum and the displacement is of the order of @xmath29 ( @xmath29 is the reduced planck scale @xmath30 gev ) .",
    "this is because of the additional susy breaking effect due to large vacuum energy of the inflaton .",
    "then , when the expansion rate of the universe ( i.e. , the hubble parameter @xmath31 ) becomes comparable to the modulus mass , the modulus starts to oscillate around its true minimum with the initial amplitude @xmath32 . at this time",
    ", the energy density of this oscillation is given by @xmath33 and the cosmic temperature of the universe is estimated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 counts the effective degrees of freedom of the radiation .",
    "thus the ratio between @xmath36 to the entropy density @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 here it should be noted that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are both diluted like @xmath39 ( @xmath25 is the scale factor of the universe ) as the universe expands .",
    "thus this ratio takes a constant value until today ( or until the modulus decays ) if `` no '' extra entropy is produced .",
    "since , at @xmath40 , the energy density of the radiation , @xmath41 , is comparable to that of the modulus ( @xmath42 ) and is diluted faster as @xmath43 , the modulus oscillation soon dominates the whole energy of the universe .    in deriving eq .",
    "( [ rp1 ] ) we have assumed that the reheating process of the primordial inflation be completed before the beginning of the modulus oscillation , i.e. , the decay rate @xmath44 of the inflaton be larger than @xmath45 . given by eq .",

    "] on the other hand , when @xmath46 , the energy of the modulus oscillation is expected to be diluted by the entropy production of the primordial inflation . where @xmath47 denotes the hubble parameter during the inflation and @xmath48 with the inflaton s vacuum energy @xmath49 .",
    "] in this case , when the reheating process completes at @xmath50 , the ratio @xmath51 is estimated as @xmath52 here @xmath53 denotes the reheating temperature of the primordial inflation which is given by @xmath54 in order to keep the success of the bbn it should be higher than about 10 mev and we obtain @xmath55 comparing with eq.([rp1 ] ) , it is seen that the primordial inflation with a low @xmath53 does dilute the modulus energy significantly . however , even if we assume the primordial inflation with extremely low reheating temperature , the energy of the modulus oscillation is still large .",
    "it leads to disastrous effect on the thermal history of the universe after the bbn if the modulus lifetime is long enough .",
    "the modulus , in fact , has a very long lifetime since it has only gravitationally suppressed interaction . from the naive dimensional analysis the modulus lifetime is estimated as shown in eq .",
    "( [ tp_naive ] ) .",
    "then we can roughly say that the modulus with a mass @xmath56 mev has a longer lifetime than the present age of the universe @xmath57 sec .",
    "we can say more precisely about the modulus lifetime for the dilaton particle which is the most plausible candidate among various moduli .",
    "the dilaton has the following couplings to the kinetic terms of the gauge fields : @xmath58 where we introduce an order one parameter @xmath59 which is determined by the string model and its compactification .",
    "for example , the dilaton has a coupling @xmath60 @xcite in some compactification of the m - theory @xcite .",
    "if the dilaton mass is light enough , say @xmath61 1 gev , it dominately decays into two photons @xcite and the lifetime of the dilaton is estimated as @xmath62 moreover , the dilaton could decay into two gluons similarly if kinematically allowed .",
    "then the dilaton lifetime becomes shorter by a factor of 1/9 counting only the number of the final states .",
    "in addition , if @xmath45 is heavier than the electroweak scale , various decay modes may arise through the gravitational interaction with the susy standard model particles , and its decay lifetime becomes shorter . comparing with the naive estimation eq .",
    "( [ tp_naive ] ) , the both results are not different very much .",
    "thus , in the present analysis we assume that the modulus lifetime be the same as the dilaton one and it decay into only two photons and two gluons if possible through the interaction ( [ lint - pgg ] ) with @xmath63 for simplicity .",
    "we turn to see constraints on the modulus energy from various cosmological observations .",
    "first of all , the stable modulus of mass @xmath17 mev is constrained from the overclosure limit .",
    "the present energy density of the modulus oscillation should be smaller than the critical density of the universe @xmath64 .",
    "this requirement leads to to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the present entropy density and @xmath67 denotes the present hubble parameter in units of 100 km / sec@xmath68mpc@xmath69 .",
    "note that even if the modulus is unstable , we obtain similar upper bound on the modulus abundance requiring that the decay products ( i.e. , photons or gluons ) should not overclose the universe .",
    "since the decay products are relativistic and its energy density decreases faster than the modulus one , the constraint on the abundance becomes weaker than eq .",
    "( [ overclose ] ) .",
    "if the lifetime of the modulus is longer than the time of the recombination @xmath70 sec , i.e. , @xmath71 gev , a stringent constraint comes from the the observed cosmic x(@xmath19)-ray background spectrum @xcite .",
    "the photon flux produced by the modulus decay directly contributes to the x(@xmath19)-ray backgrounds and we obtain the upper bound on the modulus abundance by requiring that they should not exceed the present observed spectrum .",
    "( one may find the detail analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in fact this gives us a more stringent constraint than the above overclosure limit ( [ overclose ] ) for 1 gev@xmath72 kev .",
    "therefore , this is very stringent constraint on the models of the gmsb where @xmath73 gev as first pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the modulus abundance is also constrained from the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "if the modulus lifetime is about @xmath74 sec @xmath75 sec , extra radiation energy produced by the modulus decay may cause the spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background from the blackbody one .",
    "the observation by the cobe satellite @xcite gives the following upper bounds on the modulus abundances : @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the density parameter for baryons .",
    "furthermore , the bbn plays a significant role to set limits to the moduli abundance .",
    "first , if the modulus oscillation exits at the cosmic temperature about 1 mev , its extra energy accelerates the expansion of the universe and the weak interaction freezes out earlier .",
    "this leads to higher neutron - proton number ratio and overproduction of @xmath78 . to keep the success of the bbn",
    ", the modulus energy density should be smaller than that of one neutrino species [ e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ] , i.e. , @xmath79 for @xmath80  sec .",
    "furthermore , when the modulus mass becomes larger than about 10 gev , the modulus decays soon after the bbn .",
    "if the lifetime of the modulus is longer than about @xmath2  sec , the high energy photons emitted from the modulus may destroy or overproduce the light elements of the universe synthesized by the bbn . not to spoil the success of the bbn , the modulus abundance is stringently constrained [ e.g. , see the resent work @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , when the modulus lifetime becomes shorter than about @xmath2  sec , the hadronic cascade processes associated with the modulus decay may modify the primordial abundances of light elements .",
    "this also puts the upper bound @xcite .",
    "although we have neglected the modulus decay into the susy standard model particles , the stable lightest susy particle ( lsp ) produced by the modulus decay is potentially dangerous , since its energy density might overclose the universe .",
    "however , from the present mass limit of the lsp , we find that this constraint , if exists , is weaker than those from the distortion of the cmbr and the photo ( hadronic ) dissociation of the light elements .",
    "it should be noted that the modulus with @xmath81 tev is cosmologically viable @xcite . from eq .",

    "( [ rp1 ] ) and ( [ rp2 ] ) with @xmath91 mev are also found in those figures .",
    "one can easily see that the string modulus with a mass from @xmath92 ev to 10 tev is excluded by the various cosmological observations .",
    "since @xmath28 , the whole gravitino mass region typically predicted by both gmsb and hssb models is not cosmologically allowed .",
    "this difficulty is often referred as `` cosmological moduli problem '' . here",
    "we would like to stress that this problem could not be solved by choosing the model of the primordial inflation , i.e. , even if one assumes the extremely low reheating temperature @xmath93 10 mev .",
    "this is very different from the gravitino problem .",
    "therefore , we required some extra mechanism to dilute the modulus mass density sufficiently other than the primordial inflation . in the following , we consider the thermal inflation model proposed by lyth and stewart @xcite as such a dilution mechanism .",
    "in this section we review an original thermal inflation model proposed by lyth and stewart @xcite .",
    "the thermal inflation is caused by a scalar field ( called `` flaton '' ) , and the flaton supermultiplet @xmath94 which is a singlet under the standard model gauge groups has the following superpotential : @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the coupling constant and we take @xmath97 .",

    "therefore , the vev of the flaton @xmath117 should be smaller than their masses . however , in the original thermal inflation model , this constraint is always satisfied when we estimate the minimum of the modulus abundance in the next section .",

    ", we expect @xmath130 and the flaton might not decay into @xmath25-axions .",
