    "in the past two decades , there has been an explosion of interest in the study of solitary waves in spatially discrete nonlinear systems .",
    "prominent examples , where one expects important phenomena to be intrinsically associated with spatial discreteness , are : the motion of dislocations in solid - state physics @xcite , the transmission of kink - like bits of information in josephson junction arrays @xcite , the propagation of pulses in nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite ( where they present great potential for applications such as all - optical switching , steering and demultiplexing see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , or even in chemical @xcite and biological @xcite ( and references therein ) applications .",
    "recent experimental work confirming the relevance of such models has appeared in @xcite .",
    "the models arising in many of these studies , governing the behavior of a field @xmath1 depending on a continuous time variable @xmath2 and discrete spatial variable @xmath3 , are :    _ the discrete sg equation _ ( dsg ) @xmath4 _ the discrete @xmath0 equation _",
    "( @xmath5 ) @xmath6    and the _ discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation _",
    "( dnls ) @xmath7 we have used the standard notation where @xmath8 is the inverse spatial lattice spacing and @xmath9 is the coupling constant .    an important phenomenon associated with spatial discreteness is the role of the spatial lattice sites as `` defects '' to which propagating states can be `` trapped '' or `` pinned '' @xcite . at a structural level , this is a result of the breaking of translational invariance .",
    "indeed , the spatially continuous variants are lorentz invariant ( sg , @xmath0 ) and galilean invariant ( nls ) ; a stationary coherent structure can be  boosted \" , i.e. , transformed , into one traveling with a constant velocity .",
    "the main coherent structures of interest in these equations ( see _ i.e. _ , @xcite ) are kink - like excitations in dsg and @xmath5 and time periodic , exponentially localized in space pulse like excitations in dnls ( solitary waves ) .",
    "the latter are frequently referred to as _",
    "discrete breathers_.    in the analytical and numerical work on these discrete systems @xcite two main steady states have been identified ; there are actually many other steady states @xcite .",
    "one is centered on a lattice site and one is centered between consecutive lattice sites . in the case of dsg and @xmath5 kinks , the stable configurations ( energy minimizers ) are those centered between sites , while for the breathers of dnls , stable configurations ( constrained energy minimizers ; the constraints are imposed by the additional conserved quantities such as the @xmath10 norm of the solution @xcite ) are those pulses which are centered at a lattice site .    until recently",
    ", it was believed that an initial condition , which for the translation invariant systems leads to a coherent structure propagating to infinity at a uniform speed , would in these discrete systems result in a state radiating energy which would eventually get trapped by the `` peirels -nabarro '' potential @xcite associated with the lattice and subsequently approach a time independent state .",
    "however , it was established in @xcite that , depending on the parameter regime ( lattice spacing ) , the asymptotic state may , in fact , be time - periodic .",
    "it may also consist of a time quasiperiodic state which slowly decays to a time - periodic state .",
    "the rate at which the system relaxes to its asymptotic state is controlled by resonances of `` localized internal modes '' with radiation modes .",
    "internal modes are spatially localized modes associated with the linearized operator about the coherent structure with corresponding discrete eigenfrequencies ( point spectrum ) , which are not related to an underlying group invariance ( zero modes ) .",
    "they give rise to time periodic solutions of the linearized evolution equation , of the form @xmath11 .",
    "radiation modes are those associated with the continuous spectrum of the linearization .    in a recent paper @xcite , using a methodology developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we gave a systematic approach for deriving details of the decay to an asymptotic state .",
    "we now briefly describe these results .",
    "suppose @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two internal mode frequencies associated with a coherent structure of ( [ tprleq1 ] ) , ( [ tprleq2 ] ) or ( [ tprleq3 ] ) .",
    "consider initial conditions which are a small perturbation of the coherent structure and that the perturbation ( of @xmath14 ) consists of components in the direction of the internal modes , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "as time evolves , nonlinearity generates various linear combinations of these frequencies so we investigate where such combinations land relative to the so - called phonon band ( pb ) .",
    "suppose that a combination of frequencies @xmath17 falls inside the pb with @xmath18 .",
    "for dsg and @xmath5 , pb is , respectively , the purely imaginary interval @xmath19 , \\pm i[\\sqrt{2}/d,\\sqrt{4 + 2/d^2}]$ ] and for dnls it is @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the time - frequency of the ground state discrete solitary wave . in this case we showed in @xcite that the time evolution of the internal mode powers ( squared amplitudes ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is controlled by a system whose normal form is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the set of resonant frequency combinations . the `` damping coefficients '' @xmath26 can be computed @xcite , are always nonnegative and are generically strictly positive . from ( [ tprleq4])-([tprleq5 ] ) , one concludes that the decay rate is controlled by the appropriate harmonic e.g. , if @xmath27 pb , then the ( long time asymptotic ) decay of @xmath28 goes as @xmath29 , if @xmath30 pb , it goes as @xmath31 and so on . as the parameters of the problem ( such as the lattice spacing ) vary , the set of resonances @xmath32 may vary and therefore so will the normal form equations and the nature of the asymptotic state dynamics ; see @xcite for examples of such transitions .",
    "what are the possible asymptotic states ? consider the discrete nonlinear wave equations ( [ tprleq1 ] ) and ( [ tprleq2 ] )",
    ". there is , of course , the ground state kink but one may ask whether there are additional time - periodic or even quasi - periodic states associated with the time - periodic internal modes . , e.g. , solutions of the nonlinear equation of the form : @xmath33 c.c . plus higher order corrections . here , @xmath34 denotes the ground state or least energy kink and @xmath35 denotes the set of localized internal mode frequencies . in @xcite",
    "we prove the existence of time - periodic solutions ( only _ one _ contribution to the above sum is present ) in certain parameter regimes .",
    "no quasi - periodic solutions exist since for any internal mode frequencies @xmath36 , there always exist integers @xmath37 such that @xmath38 pb . there are however metastable , very long - lived states of this type .    for dsg ,",
    "depending on parameter regime , we have between one and three possible asymptotic states from among @xmath34 ( the ground state kink ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , each with their own basin of attraction . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are time - periodic solutions associated with perturbed translational modes ( i.e. , bifurcating from the origin of the spectral plane ) and edge ( bifurcating from the edge of the continuous spectrum ) internal modes ( theorem 5.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "see table i.    for @xmath5 , we have between one and three from among @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "the additional periodic solution @xmath42 , is associated with the additional _ shape mode _ present in the point spectrum of the @xmath0 model .",
    "see table ii .",
    "the above periodic solutions are localized time - periodic excitations on a kink ( spatially inhomogeneous ) background , `` breathers on kinks '' ( bok s ) ; see fig .",
    "their dynamic stability in various regimes of the discreteness parameter @xmath43 was numerically investigated in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to dnls .",
    "seek solutions of the form @xmath44 this gives rise to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations for @xmath45 @xmath46 a variational approach to the questions of existence , excitation thresholds and nonlinear lyapunov stability of the ground states of ( [ bnls ] ) is presented in @xcite .",
    "solutions can also be constructed by iterative methods implemented numerically in @xcite .",
    "linear stability analysis proceeds by seeking a solution of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the perturbation about the ground state .",
    "this leads to the spectral problem    @xmath49    the analysis of the modes for different values of the relevant parameter @xmath50 is given in @xcite .",
    "there it is found for the stable ( site - centered ) pulses of dnls that there are two modes , a perturbed translational internal mode ( the `` pinning '' mode ) and an edge mode ( the `` breathing '' mode ) . the picture for dnls",
    "is derived in @xcite and is analogous to that described above and in @xcite for equations ( [ tprleq1])-([tprleq2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "2 , the relevant ( localized ) eigenmode frequencies are given and compared with those of the pb .",
    "the analysis of @xcite shows that the methodology of @xcite can be applied in this case , even though the basis of eigenfunctions is not orthonormal ( the breathing mode has non - vanishing overlap with the rotational symmetry eigenmodes with @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , a pseudo - scalar product can be used @xcite in the spirit of @xcite to perform the same analysis .",
    "johansson and aubry do this in two alternative ways ( higher order perturbation theory and a conservation law approach ) but nonetheless reach a special case of the result of @xcite proving that when the @xmath52-th harmonic of a mode is inside pb , then the amplitude of the mode decays as @xmath53 asymptotically , as is suggested also by eqns .",
    "( [ tprleq4])-([tprleq5 ] ) . however , in the dnls case , they found , additionally , that the existence of the additional two - dimensional manifold of eigenmodes with zero frequency , in order to avoid unphysical divergences of higher order perturbations ( due to projections on this manifold ) , causes an increase of the breather mode frequency according to @xmath54 .",
    "the methods of @xcite can be used to extend the picture developed in @xcite . using the information , displayed in figure 2 , on the location of linear combinations of internal mode frequencies associated with the ground state of equation ( [ bnls ] ) , relative to the phonon band pb",
    ", we can conclude :    * for any value of @xmath50 for which the edge mode exists ( @xmath55 ) , initial conditions close to it decay as @xmath29 since its second harmonic is always inside pb . * the perturbed translational mode ( which disappears around @xmath56 as is noted in @xcite ) , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 is inside pb , hence the decay in this range goes as @xmath29 .",
    "however , for @xmath59 , the third harmonic resonates with pb and hence the decay goes as @xmath31 .",
    "subsequently @xmath60 for @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 for @xmath63 $ ] are implied by principle resonance occurring for higher harmonics .",
    "therefore , for any value of the coupling there are harmonics of the individual modes that are in the phonon band and hence cause decay of the internal mode oscillations .",
    "hence , no genuinely periodic solutions along eigendirections can survive in this case ( in the frame co - rotating with the discrete breather frequency @xmath21 ) .",
    "the decay however can be extremely slow as we now explain .",
    "the perturbed translational mode , the neutral oscillatory mode to which the translation zero mode is perturbed for @xmath64 , approaches zero very fast for small @xmath65 , the continuum limit .",
    "this approach has been shown to be exponentially fast as @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) in @xcite . therefore , as seen in figure 2 and can be derived from the above estimates , for very small values of @xmath50 , only _ very _ high harmonics will fall inside pb . by the analysis of @xcite this corresponds to very slow time",
    "decay rates of the internal mode oscillations , which may be hard to detect numerically .",
    "an example of this sort is given in figure 3 .",
    "the numerical experiment is performed for dnls , with @xmath68 and for the perturbed translational mode of @xmath69 , the @xmath70-th harmonic is the leading one in the phonon band . the initial condition is taken to be the exact breather profile with a small perturbation along the perturbed translational mode eigendirection .",
    "the background oscillations are clearly discernible as time - dependent side wobbles in the evolving profile .",
    "our simulations show very slow decay of these oscillations , in accordance with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the analysis of @xcite implies that these modes will decay to the ground state standing wave breather but only over very long time scales .",
    "modes such as the one that is observed in figure 3 are very long - lived time - periodic and spatially localized . in view of ( [ tprleq6a ] )",
    "they correspond to slowly decaying ( metastable ) quasi - periodic oscillations of dnls ( which are periodic in the rotating frame ) .",
    "the periodic oscillation is mounted on a breather background .",
    "hence these modes are ( metastable ) breathers on breathers ( bob s ) .",
    "we note that there are other constructions of quasiperiodic modes in discrete systems .",
    "such attempts ( see , for example , @xcite ) exploited continuation from the anti - continuum limit of two oscillators with different frequencies . also , for polaron",
    "type models such as the holstein model , a proof of existence of quasiperiodic solutions was give in @xcite .",
    "our analysis above is not restricted to the regime where the sites are weakly coupled .",
    "however , it should be noted that very close to the continuum limit , logarithmic effects similar to the ones described in @xcite for generalized _ continuum _ nls equations may become relevant .",
    "the work presented herein mainly focuses in the regimes of large or moderate discreteness and the mechanisms described will still be present even for very small discreteness .",
    "the work of @xcite , however , raises the interesting question as to whether there is a crossover point beyond which ( in approaching the continuum limit ) logarithmic effects become dominant over power law ones . such issues will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "are there time quasi - periodic states which are non - decaying ?",
    "we now display a family of ( non - decaying ) time quasi - periodic and spatially localized bob states .",
    "our point of departure will be the modes introduced in @xcite , which we call twisted localized modes ( tlm s ) .",
    "these modes are solutions of dnls of the form ( [ ansatz ] ) with @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "they can be viewed as soliton - antisoliton bound pairs which can exist due to discreteness @xcite .",
    "there is no continuum analog since in the continuum case a soliton - antisoliton initial condition naturally repels .    henceforth , for simplicity we will fix @xmath73 and vary @xmath74 only .",
    "we construct these modes numerically by solving equation ( [ bnls ] ) and subsequently solve numerically eqs .",
    "( [ tprleq7])-([tprleq8 ] ) to determine their linear stability .",
    "we find that    * tlm s are stable for @xmath75 .",
    "their spectrum for this parameter range consists of two modes at @xmath51 and an additional internal mode with frequency @xmath76 in the gap between @xmath77 and edge of pb .",
    "* for values @xmath78 a series of instabilities arise giving quite interesting phenomena that have been analyzed elsewhere @xcite .    for @xmath74 in the range of stability",
    ", the location of multiples of the single non - zero frequency ( @xmath76 ) relative to pb is displayed in figure 4 .",
    "it can be seen that    * for @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 pb and hence implying decay of the internal mode oscillation about the tlm with a rate : @xmath60 . for @xmath81",
    "$ ] , @xmath82 pb implying @xmath31 decay and for @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath84 pb implying a @xmath29 decay rate . * more interestingly , as figure 4 suggests , the gaps between the above coupling parameter intervals constitute parameter regimes for which no multiples of @xmath76 lie inside pb .",
    "hence an initial condition consisting of the exact mode plus a perturbation along the @xmath76 eigendirection encounters no evident decay mechanism .",
    "indeed , the proof of theorem 5.1 of @xcite can be carried through in this case to obtain the existence of time - periodic solutions of the nonlinear perturbation equation governing @xmath85 . in this way ,",
    "we have constructed genuine time quasi - periodic solutions ( bob s ) of dnls of the form ( [ tprleq6a ] ) , where @xmath85 is time periodic .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 5 , where we display the results of a numerical experiment for @xmath86 , where the internal mode frequency is @xmath87 .",
    "we observe the very regular oscillations on top of the breather amplitude due to the bob s quasi - periodicity .",
    "we saw in the previous section that tlm s can be thought of as a pulse and an antipulse whose `` backs '' have merged .",
    "the question that then stems from this analogy is whether genuinely quasiperiodic solutions of dnls arise naturally in such multipulse setups where two or more pulses have been concatenated .",
    "a general analysis of such configurations for discrete setups has been given in @xcite for two pulses and generalized in @xcite for multiple pulses .",
    "in these works it has been found that in order for multipulses to be stable , the nearest neighbor ones have to possess opposite parity , i.e. , a phase difference of @xmath88 .",
    "hence , we will consider only such configurations hereafter .    in order to understand the possibilities for quasiperiodic solutions of multipulse type ,",
    "let us return to the linearization picture for a single pulse .",
    "as is well known , for the single pulse , there are two pairs of eigenvalues near the origin of the spectral plane , the rotational modes ( of zero frequency ) and the translational modes of frequency dependence ( on @xmath89 ) as @xmath90 . for a concatenation of n pulses , there will be @xmath91 pairs near the origin .",
    "@xmath92 of them will be translational ( stemming from the linear combinations of the translational eigenmodes of the individual pulses ) , 1 pair will be the rotational one of @xmath51 and @xmath93 pairs will pertain to the so - called interaction eigenmodes @xcite , whose frequencies will , in general , behave as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the ( typical ) pulse separation . it should be noted that for such multipulse configurations to occur , it necessary for the pulses to have a separation larger than a minimal one @xmath96 .    for values of @xmath97 ,",
    "as was found in @xcite , it is generically true that for @xmath96 , the interaction eigenvalues have frequencies typically lower than the translational ones .",
    "hence , since as we saw in section ii , quasiperiodic solutions can not be formed for such regimes of the lattice spacing , as the translational eigenvalues resonate with the continuous spectrum , hence such solutions will also not be but metastable for the multipulse configurations as well .    from the above argument",
    ", it can be seen that for multipulse configurations , as was the case with the tlm s of section iii , only strong discreteness contexts @xmath98 provide the possibility for quasiperiodic solutions . in such regimes of strong discreteness ,",
    "the translational eigenmodes have already merged with the continuous spectrum @xcite and only the interaction eigenmodes ( and their harmonics ) relative position to the continuous spectrum has to be accounted for .    in order to understand",
    "the behavior of multipulses , a natural continuation parameter that we will use in this context is the separation between the pulses @xmath95 . in the case of the tlm s",
    ", this separation will be considered @xmath89 , i.e. , the distance between the pulse maximum and the antipulse minimum . in this case",
    ", the form of the solution is shown in the top left panel of fig .",
    "6 and the form of the evolution of @xmath99 as a function of @xmath50 is given in the top right panel . in the middle two and lower two panels of fig . 6 ,",
    "similar results are shown for @xmath100 , and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "what can be clearly observed is that in these cases , the dependence of the internal ( interaction ) eigenmode on the coupling constant is such that _ for any value of @xmath89 _ , there are harmonics of the internal mode frequency _ inside _ the pb . hence , the tlm s are very special in the sense that the relation of their centers positions is such that it permits for a set of intervals of coupling constants to have no resonances of internal modes with the pb and , thus , quasiperiodic solutions .",
    "to show the generality of the above conclusion , we performed similar numerical experiments for @xmath102-pulse configurations ( in which the middle one was of opposite phase than the two outer ones ) .",
    "the case of @xmath103 is once again shown in the top left panel of fig .",
    "7 and the corresponding resonance diagram of @xmath99 as a function of @xmath50 appears in the top right panel of the same figure .",
    "the same plots for @xmath100 and @xmath101 are shown in the middle and lower rows of fig .",
    "7 respectively . in this case , as per the general discussion presented above , there are two pairs of interaction eigenmodes . in the case of @xmath103 , it can be observed that their frequency increases as a function of @xmath50 and hence gaps appear in the presence of the modes harmonics in the pb .",
    "such gaps for instance are found for @xmath104 , @xmath105 for the first frequency ( in solid line ) or for @xmath106 for the second internal mode ( in dashed line ) .",
    "excitation of one of these internal modes in the respective intervals will give rise to genuinely quasiperiodic solutions .",
    "on the other hand , it can be observed that already for @xmath100 , once again the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath50 is monotinically decreasing and that harmonics will always be present inside .",
    "the same picture of course in maintained for @xmath101 and for larger interpulse distances .",
    "these results lead us to the conclusion that generically quasiperiodic solutions of the tlm variety ( and its multipulse generalization ) will be present in dnls type systems . however , this is a rather `` delicate '' result of the interplay between the lattice spacing @xmath89 and the interpulse separation @xmath95 which has been found to be quite special to such .",
    "more general multipulse solutions of larger interpulse distance are invariably found to possess internal modes whose harmonics are resonant with the pb and hence in the latter case only metastable quasiperiodic configurations will be present .",
    "in this paper , we have given theoretical justification as well as numerical evidence of the existence and asymptotic stability of breather - like modes which consist of ( depending on parameter regime ) infinitely long lived or very long lived spatially localized and time - periodic oscillations on a kink background ( bok s ) or on a breather background ( bob s ) .",
    "these modes are different from previously reported ones in that they reside on a non - uniform ( coherent structure ) background rather than on a uniform background . because of their relevance to asymptotic states for a wide range of initial conditions ( possibly in experimental situations of interest ) further study and understanding of these modes as well as analytical investigation of their stability are challenging questions worth pursuing .",
    "the existence of genuinely quasi - periodic solutions is apparently rare for nonlinear conservative wave equations on infinite spatial domains .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of nonlinear wave equations on finite domains .",
    "the discrete case corresponds to finite dimensional kam theory .",
    "the continuum case ( that of vibrations , strings and membranes ) is studied in @xcite , where such solutions have been constructed .",
    "the non - generic nature of such quasi - periodic solutions was however demonstrated for discrete systems in the infinite domain , and their generalization to multipulse type configurations was also considered ."
