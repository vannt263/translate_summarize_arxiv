    "@xcite shown in table  [ tab : ewdata ] for convenience ; aside from the @xmath105 mass , the 14 data are all @xmath106-pole quantities .",

    "in a grand unified model based on su(15 )  @xcite each generation of quarks and leptons is represented by a fundamental * 15*. to cancel anomalies of three generations , three generations of mirror fermions are needed . since these mirror fermions obtain their masses from the vev which breaks standard su(2)@xmath25u(1)@xmath26 symmetry they necessarily are close to the weak scale in mass and give significant contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "even if we assume that members of the same su(2)@xmath13 doublet have degenerate masses , and hence the mirror fermions give no contribution to @xmath1 , they do give a very large contribution to @xmath0 parameter ; @xmath160 .",
    "then one might think that this model is already excluded by the precision electroweak analysis ? however , there are many extra particles including bileptons and leptoquarks in the model",
    ". these extra particles could give non - negligible contributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 as discussed in the previous sections . as is easily read from eqs .",
    "( [ stbl : sf ] ) and ( [ sptp ] ) , there is a negative contribution to @xmath0 coming from bileptons if the singly - charged bilepton ( @xmath107 ) is heavier than the doubly - charged one ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this negative contribution can cancel the large positive contribution coming from mirror fermions . on the other hand",
    ", such a mass difference of bileptons gives a large positive contribution to the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "but this could , in turn , be canceled by a negative contribution of leptoquarks without affecting the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the vertex and box corrections are quite negligible in this su(15 ) case where the @xmath161@xmath162 mass difference is large .",
    "we have explicitly checked that there exists an extended region of parameter space where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are acceptable : su(15 ) grand unification is not yet excluded by experiment !",
    "the continued robustness of the standard model with respect to more and more accurate experimental data gives tight constraints on any attempt at ornamentation of the theory by additional `` light '' physics .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 provide a very convenient measure of compatibility with the precision electroweak data .",
    "additional states give , in general , postive contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 and hence rapidly lead to a possible inconsistency .",
    "it is therefore of special interest to define what architecture can contribute negatively to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "here we have discussed two examples : bileptons and leptoquarks . for bileptons",
    "we have derived a lower bound of @xmath163gev for the singly - charged bileptonic gauge boson , assuming that bileptons are the only states additional to the standard model ; this improves considerably on the mass bound available from direct measurement .    if we identify the putative leptoquark at hera with a mixture of scalar doublets of su(2 ) having different hypercharge , this can also improve agreement with data .",
    "finally we have addressed the exaggerated reports of the death of su(15 ) grand unification due to the large positive @xmath0 value from its three generations of mirror fermions .",
    "because of the simultaneous presence of both bileptons and leptoquarks in su(15 ) , there is an extended neighborhood in parameter space where @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) can be acceptably small in magnitude .",
