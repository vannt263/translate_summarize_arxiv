    "today the casimir effect is being actively investigated not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "historically the first measurement of the casimir force between metals was performed in 1958 @xcite and confirmed the existence of the force with an uncertainty of about 100% . in the following decades",
    "the experimental output was painfully low and only one experiment with metal test bodies was made @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in the last few years",
    "many measurements of the casimir force have been performed using torsion pendulums , atomic force microscopes , micromechanical torsional oscillators , and other laboratory techniques [ 416 ] .",
    "most authors ( see refs .  [ 114 ] ) have used the concept of the root - mean - square deviation between experiment and theory to quantify the precision of the measurements . however , for strongly nonlinear quantities , such as the casimir force which changes rapidly with separation distance",
    ", this method is not appropriate because it may lead to different results when applied in different ranges of separations .",
    "this was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite although no better method was suggested .",
    "the present paper contains the comparison analysis of the precision and accuracy in two recent experiments @xcite using rigorous methods of mathematical statistics .",
    "the distinctive feature of our approach is that both total experimental and total theoretical errors are determined independently of one another at some accepted confidence level .",
    "then , the absolute error of differences between calculated and measured values of the physical quantity is found at the same confidence as a function of separation , serving as a measure of the precision in the comparison of experiment and theory .",
    "in experiment @xcite the casimir pressure between two au coated parallel plates was determined dynamically by means of a microelectromechanical torsional oscillator within the separation region from 160 to 750 nm . in experiment",
    "@xcite the casimir force was measured between a si plate and a large au coated sphere using an atomic force microscope within the separations from 62.33 to 600.04 nm . in our error analysis",
    "we use the notation @xmath0 which denotes either the measured casimir pressure @xmath1 or force @xmath2 as a function of separation @xmath3 between the test bodies .",
    "usually several sets of measurements , say @xmath4 , are taken within one separation region ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is done in order to decrease the random error and to narrow the confidence interval . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath6 , and in ref .",

    "each set consists of pairs @xmath8 $ ] where @xmath9 in ref .",

    "different @xmath14 may be different ( this was the case in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for such measurement results",
    "it is reasonable to divide the entire separation range ( @xmath5 ) into partial subintervals of length @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the absolute error in the measurement of separations equal to 0.6 nm and 0.8 nm in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "in so doing , each subinterval @xmath17 contains a group of @xmath18 points @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath18 ranges from 3 to 13 ) . inside each subinterval",
    "all points @xmath21 can be considered as equivalent , because within the interval of width @xmath15 the value of absolute separation is distributed uniformly .",

    "\\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    direct calculation shows that the mean values @xmath27 are uniform , i.e. , change smoothly with the change of @xmath28 .",
    "the variances of the mean , @xmath29 , are , however , not uniform .",
    "to smooth them , we have used a special procedure developed in mathematical statistics @xcite . at each separation @xmath30 , in order to find the uniform variance of a mean , we consider not only one subinterval containing @xmath30 but also several neighboring subintervals from both sides of @xmath30 ( 4 or 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or about 30 neighboring points in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the number of neighboring subintervals or points is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "then the smoothed variance of the mean at a point @xmath30 is given by @xcite @xmath32 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are the statistical weights .",
    "the maximum in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is taken over two sets of coefficients , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 where the constants @xmath36 are determined from @xmath37 .",
    "note that max in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) leads to the most conservative result , i.e. , overestimates the random error .",
    "finally , the confidence interval at a confidence probability @xmath38 takes the form @xmath39 , \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where the random absolute error in the measurement of the quantity @xmath22 at a separation @xmath30 is given by @xmath40 here the value of @xmath41 can be found in tables for the student s @xmath42-distribution .",

    "table 1 [ columns 4 and 10 labeled ( c ) ] contain the total experimental error of the casimir pressure and force measurements in the experiments @xcite , respectively .",
    "as seen in column 4 of table 1 , in the experiment @xcite at @xmath48 nm the total experimental error is equal to 1.4% , but in a wide separation range from 170 to 300 nm , it is practically flat and within the range from 0.54 to 0.59% .",
    "even at @xmath86 nm it is equal to only 5.4% . in the experiment @xcite ( column 10 in table 1 ) the smallest total experimental error of 0.87% is achieved @xmath53 nm and increases up to 5.3% at @xmath87 nm .",
    "this is mainly due to the large contribution of the random errors .",
    "the theoretical values of @xmath0 ( both the pressure and force ) are computed using the lifshitz formula ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which takes into account the effects of finite conductivity and nonzero temperature .",
    "the lifshitz formula contains the reflection coefficients at imaginary matsubara frequencies . at zero matsubara frequency",

    "@xcite the reflection coefficients at all matsubara frequencies were expressed using the free electron plasma model ( the plasma model approach ) .",
    "one error in the theoretical computation arises from sample to sample variations of the optical data for the complex index of refraction .",

    "as is seen from these columns , the errors @xmath93 depend only slightly on separation and take similar values between 0.55 and 0.70% .",
    "in addition to the major theoretical errors @xmath94 , there exist other uncertainties in calculations which are not taken into account in the lifshitz formula .",
    "some of them were shown to be negligibly small ( like the contributions from patch potentials , nonlocal effects and finite sizes of the plates @xcite ) .",
    "as to the contribution from the surface roughness , it was calculated using the atomic force microscope images of the interacting surfaces and taken into account as a correction [ 1416 ] .",
    "this is why these factors do not contribute to the balance of theoretical errors .",
    "there is one more error which can be considered together with the theoretical errors if one is going to compare the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this arises from the fact that @xmath3 is determined experimentally with an error @xmath16 ( see sec .  2.1 ) , and this error results in the additional uncertainties @xmath95 in computations . bearing in mind the leading theoretical dependences of the pressure and force on separation , we obtain @xmath96 in ref .",

    "<S> in most experiments on the casimir force the comparison between measurement data and theory was done using the concept of the root - mean - square deviation , a procedure that has been criticized in literature . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a special statistical analysis which should be performed separately for the experimental data and for the results of the theoretical computations . in so doing , </S>",
    "<S> the random , systematic , and total experimental errors are found as functions of separation , taking into account the distribution laws for each error at 95% confidence . </S>",
    "<S> independently , all theoretical errors are combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the same confidence . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the confidence interval for the differences between theoretical and experimental values is obtained as a function of separation . </S>",
    "<S> this rigorous approach is applied to two recent experiments on the casimir effect . </S>"
