    "( in such cases the more conventional 2hdm rgm is appropriate . ) too small",
    "scalar - quark ( diagonal ) masses break down the expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite and too large scalar threshold - corrections can break down the epm approximation .",
    "indeed , one has to ensure that the scalar quarks are not heavier than about 1 tev in order not to invalidate the loop expansion which underlies the ep , as these large logarithms would be multiplied by large couplings ( see , for example , ref .",
    "we checked that the points in the parameter space where the rgm and epm are in sharp disagreement ( e.g. , in figs .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] and [ fig : f5 ] ) correspond to either one of these cases .      in this work",
    "we do not carry out a two - loop calculation of @xmath75 .",

    "in fact , an hybrid algorithm between the epm and rgm is required .",
    "we received recently two interesting papers where ( partial ) two - loop analyses were presented @xcite . in this section",
    "we compare those results with the residual two - loop terms we identified above .",
    "we will take a somewhat critical point of view emphasizing that though the above studies ( as well as the discussion here ) pave the way to understanding @xmath75 beyond one - loop order , they are not complete . we conclude that the one - loop leading - logarithm result is most probably an upper bound on the two - loop result , but we doubt whether any stronger conclusions can be drawn at the present .",
    "above , we presented the leading - logarithm result . in the epm",
    "this is given by @xmath223 and in the rgm one solves the rge s to that order .",
    "we found no significant difference between the two methods .",
    "next , we proceeded to calculate beyond the leading order and integrated the rgm rge s numerically , summing the leading logarithms to all orders in perturbation theory , and , in particular , to two - loop order .",
    "we then found a @xmath442 correction to @xmath75 . on the other hand",
    ", we identified in the epm expressions next - to - leading two - loop logarithmic terms .",
    "those terms come about from the scale dependence of the running parameters , and introduce a similar ( but positive ) correction to @xmath75 .",
    "also , we noted the important ( @xmath443 ) effect of @xmath444 $ ] [ e.g. , @xmath445 .",
    "it is then suggestive that the two - loop leading logarithms and @xmath60 corrections would diminish the one - loop ( leading - logarithm ) result , while the next - to - leading logarithms would partially counter - balance that effect .",
    "thus , we reach the conclusion that the one - loop leading - logarithm prediction for @xmath64 ( which contain some next - to - leading logarithms ) is an upper bound on the two - loop prediction .",
    "any stronger conclusion would require a detailed consideration of the issues listed above .",
    "furthermore , the significance of a detailed two - loop study in the context of sgut s is not clear unless complemented by similar studies of threshold effects near the high - scale boundary .",
    "let us proceed with the issue of the orders in perturbation theory .",
    "it was already pointed out by chankowski @xcite that the inclusion of @xmath223 in ( [ pot ] ) with only one - loop rge s for the ( rg - improved ) potential parameters is an inconsistent procedure when counting powers of couplings .",
    "these issues have recently received great attention in the context of theories with a single scalar field ( i.e. , @xmath446 or the sm ) @xcite .",
    "it was explicitly shown that a rg - improved l - loop effective potential is consistent when the parameters are calculated using ( l+1)-loop rge s @xcite .",
    "the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite were recently applied to the mssm by kodaira et al .",
    "@xcite who extended a previous work of espinosa and quiros @xcite . indeed , they find that the two - loop rgm with one - loop ep slightly increase the one - loop rgm result . however , they impose the naive assumption of only one relevant scale ( @xmath447 ) below which the sm rge s are in effect ( and the ep contain only a @xmath60 correction ) .",
    "thus , the mssm parameters are not treated on the same footing as the sm ones , and one expects some modification of their numerical results .",
    "however , we note that the correction is positive : recall that the difference between the two rgm approximations is the next - to - leading logarithms , which we found to be positive by examining the scale dependence of the result .",
    "hempfling and hoang @xcite explicitly calculate the two - loop rgm correction ( using the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , finding @xmath448 , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] which roughly agrees with our eq . ( [ q ] ) .",
    "those authors go further to derive a diagramatic two - loop result ( in a simplified model ) which diminishes @xmath75 below its two - loop rgm prediction .",
    "they then show that , e.g. , if the difference between the pole and running @xmath5-quark mass is accounted for in the rgm calculation by appropriate matching conditions , the two methods agree .",
    "this again stresses the need for adequate choice of matching conditions .",
    "however , it is not clear that there are no other effects of that order of magnitude that can slightly increase @xmath75 .",
    "[ also , we showed that scalar mixings which are neglected in the above two - loop calculations and in our eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , are not apriori negligible . ]    in short , all analyses support the conclusion that two - loop logarithms will diminish the one - loop leading logarithm result ( in particular , if one properly distinguishes the @xmath5-quark pole mass from the running mass ) .",
    "however , it is not clear that the prediction of a complete two - loop analysis lies as low as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( or by our fig .",
    "[ fig : f9 ] ) .",
    "( if indeed this is the case our upper bounds will be significantly strengthened . )",
    "if there is an extended heavy higgs sector ( as is assumed by some authors when trying to explain the light fermion spectrum ) with large representations coupling to the third family ( i.e. , there is no flavor symmetry that forbids such couplings ) then ( [ yuk ] ) does not hold and our constraints are evaded . alternatively , some models extend the light higgs sector by adding a sm singlet superfield , @xmath449 , to the spectrum .",
    "this is the only addition to the higgs sector which is consistent ( i.e. , without fine - tuned cancellations ) with coupling constant unification .",
