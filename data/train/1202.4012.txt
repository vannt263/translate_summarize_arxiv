    "the measurement of neutrino masses and mixings during the past decade has provided the first evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it has also raised the possibility that this new knowledge may help to unravel the physics of flavor and also possibly unlock the mystery behind the origin of matter in the universe .",
    "an important recent experimental finding in this area has been the announcements by the t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite and double chooz  @xcite , and most recently by the daya bay and reno  @xcite experiments that one of the hitherto unknown neutrino mixing angles , namely @xmath3 , is not only non - zero but `` large '' .",
    "some hints for a large @xmath3 have also been suggested by a global analysis of the existing oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "a non - zero @xmath3 has profound implications for our understanding of the physics of neutrino mass , and it is therefore timely to search for the prediction of @xmath3 in various models  @xcite .",
    "a key question before theorists now is : what is the big picture of flavor where known quark and lepton masses and mixings fit together ?",
    "a framework that suggests itself is grand unified theories ( gut ) , where all matter and all forces ( except gravity ) unify at high energy scale .",
    "since single - step coupling unification in these theories requires supersymmetry ( susy ) , we will focus on susy - guts for approaching the flavor problem and use the seesaw mechanism  @xcite to understand the small neutrino masses .",
    "a possible advantage of this framework is that matter unification is expected to reduce the number of free parameters that determine fermion masses and mixings from 31 parameters in the seesaw extended standard model , so that one can make predictions to make the model testable .",
    "the minimal scenario which is predictive for neutrinos is a renormalizable supersymmetric @xmath1 model with * 10 * and * 126 * higgs fields contributing to fermion masses  @xcite .",
    "this model embodies both the type - i and type - ii  @xcite seesaw contributions to neutrino masses and has been analyzed in many papers  @xcite . fitting charged fermion masses in these models leads to predictions for lepton mixing angles and will be tested with higher precision measurement of these angles and the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "detailed analysis of the superpotential and symmetry breaking for these models have been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the next step with these models is to see if yukawa couplings can be predicted as consequences of higher - scale symmetries .",
    "there have been several such approaches  @xcite which adopt the point of view that yukawa couplings are dynamical fields , namely the flavon fields , whose vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) determine the observed yukawa couplings .",
    "if these vevs could be the result of the minimization of simple superpotentials , that would reduce the number of parameters and would indeed be a step further in the search for an understanding of flavor .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , such a model was presented where the gut scale @xmath1 theory was extended to include three flavon fields with an @xmath0 symmetry , where the flavon fields , as well as the three matter families , form a three dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the ground state of the @xmath0 theory has only 11 parameters describing all flavor , i.e. quark and charged lepton masses and quark mixings as well as neutrino masses and lepton mixings . using pure type ii seesaw contribution",
    ", it was argued that the model is in qualitative agreement with observations . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed numerical analysis of this model and its predictions in the neutrino sector as well as for proton decay .",
    "we find that once we include the susy threshold corrections to quark masses and a small type - i contribution to neutrino masses , all existing data in the quark and charged lepton sector can be fitted to a good accuracy ; furthermore , the model predicts the solar to atmospheric mass ratio @xmath9 and the solar and atmospheric mixing angles in agreement with the current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "however , with the flavon vacuum alignment as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the fermion fit predicts a reactor mixing angle @xmath10 which is more than @xmath11 below the current experimental value  @xcite .",
    "we find that a larger value of @xmath3 , consistent with the daya bay and reno results can be obtained by a slightly different flavon vacuum alignment which results due to an additional term in the superpotential allowed by the @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "we will demonstrate the determination of these features , and also note the correlation between the different parameters , which can make it easier to rule out the model .",
    "we also find that in order to get the desired threshold corrections to the @xmath12-quark mass to fit observations , we need a large negative @xmath13 and/or @xmath14-terms in the model .",
    "we discuss predictions for higgs mass for this choice of mssm parameters , and find that the higgs mass should be below 129 gev in order to satisfy the constraints from the fermion sector fit .",
    "we also obtain lower limits on the squark masses from the same constraints .",
    "in particular , we note that if the higgs mass is discovered between 120 - 128 gev , the light stop should be heavier than 755 ( 211 ) gev for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in this model .",
    "these features could be used to test the model at the lhc .",
    "finally , we discuss proton lifetime predictions in this model .",
    "we find that in order to suppress the @xmath17 contributions to proton lifetime , we need to work in the low @xmath18 regime , which is the reason we need a large @xmath14-term for the threshold correction , as noted above .",
    "we find that the @xmath19-violating @xmath20 - terms contribute dominantly to @xmath5 decay mode for which we find a partial lifetime of @xmath6 yrs .",
    "we emphasize that proton lifetime predictions as well as the predictions for neutrino mixings can be used to test the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the essential points of the minimal @xmath0 model ; in section iii , we discuss the fermion mass fits and the predictions for the neutrino sector ; in section iv , we present a slightly different vacuum alignment which predicts a large @xmath3 while being consistent with the rest of the fermion sector . in section",
    "v , we discuss the susy threshold correction required to fit quark masses and its implications for gluino , stop and the higgs masses in the model . in section",
    "vi , we discuss our predictions for proton lifetime and in section vii , we summarize our results .",
    "the class of @xmath1 models we are interested in here have two * 10 * higgs fields ( denoted by @xmath21 ) and one @xmath22 ( accompanied by * 126 * , denoted by @xmath23 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-invariant yukawa couplings of the model are given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 s denote the * 16 * dimensional spinors of @xmath1 , which contain all the matter fields of each generation ; there are , of course , three such fields , though we have suppressed the generation indices .",
    "the yukawa couplings are therefore @xmath26 matrices in generation space .",
    "the effective yukawa couplings @xmath27 are assumed to have descended from a higher scale theory which has an @xmath8 symmetry broken by flavon fields @xmath28 determined by the minimum of the flavon potential .",
    "the alignment of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the flavon fields as given in ref .",
    "@xcite are : @xmath29 as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to get the desired yukawa couplings naturally from the high scale theory , we supplement the @xmath8 symmetry group by an @xmath30 group , and the corresponding effective superpotential is given by @xmath31 where the brackets stand for the @xmath8 singlet contraction of flavor index  @xcite .",
    "the fermion mass matrices are derived from the yukawa interaction as follows : after gut symmetry breaking , two linear combinations of the sm doublets remain light , denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "typically , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the up(down)-type sm doublets in the @xmath36 .",
    "the effective @xmath32 coupling at the mssm scale is then given by @xmath37 , and similarly for @xmath33 .",
    "the fermion mass matrices can be written in terms of these couplings as @xmath38 where we have absorbed the mixings @xmath39 and the vevs @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , to re - define the yukawa coupling matrices as follows : @xmath42 with the ratios @xmath43    these effective coupling matrices determined by the flavon sector are of the form @xmath44 it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath8 symmetry constrains @xmath45 to have the above rank - one form .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 are chosen to be complex , giving a total of 10 parameters in the charged - fermion sector .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is , in general , given by a combination of the type - i and ii seesaw mechanism : @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the vevs of the sm triplet higgs fields @xmath49 in * 126*. if we assume type - ii dominance , imposed by the ratio of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the magnitude of the coupling @xmath52 , the neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 takes an approximate tri - bimaximal ( tbm )  @xcite form via the form of @xmath52 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , which is diagonalized by @xmath54 note that the full neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the unitary matrices that diagonalize the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , respectively .",
    "hence , we will necessarily have corrections to the tbm mixing given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tbm ] ) coming from the charged lepton mass matrix as well as the type - i contribution .",
    "note further that since the @xmath52 matrix also contributes to the quark and charged lepton masses , neutrino masses and quark masses are connected , thus making the model predictive .",
    "we diagonalize the mass matrices given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) and use the minuit2 tool library  @xcite to minimize the sum of chi - squares for the mass eigenvalues and ckm mixing in the charged - fermion sector as well as the mass - squared differences @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the neutrino sector .",
    "we note that a small but non - zero type - i contribution is required in the neutrino mass matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : neu ] ) , in order to have a consistent fit with the correct mass squared ratio @xmath60 ; on the other hand , a large type - i contribution will spoil the tbm structure given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) and hence results in too small mixing angles .",
    "a balancing of the two is required in order to satisfy the observed neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we also note that susy threshold corrections to the down quark mass matrix  @xcite must be included in order to get a consistent fit for the charged fermion sector .",
    "the details of this analysis are given in section v. also , as discussed in section vi , the proton decay constraints are satisfied only for low @xmath18 in this model , as the yukawa couplings responsible for the proton decay rates grow with @xmath18 .",
    "hence , we have chosen @xmath61 for our numerical analysis given below .",

    "in order to compare the fermion masses and mixing values obtained from the model at the gut scale with the experimental values at the weak scale , we must take into account the susy threshold correction effects  @xcite .",
    "there are two main contributions to the susy threshold correction to the fermion masses : one coming from the gluino loop and another from the chargino loop .",
    "the largest correction is for the bottom mass , which is given by  @xcite @xmath66 and the function @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 similarly , if we do not add any off - diagonal threshold corrections , the ckm mixings involving the third generation receive corrections as follows   @xcite : @xmath69 however , once off diagonal threshold corrections are included , there are further changes to ckm mixing , which we take into account in our numerical analysis .    from the numerical fit , we find that at the gut scale , without including the threshold corrections , some of the best - fit values predicted by the model do not agree with experimental values extrapolated to the gut scale ( see table ii ) .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath70 comparing these values with the experimental values , we note that large negative threshold corrections are required for the model to have a consistent fermion - sector fit .",

    "the required threshold corrections at the gut scale are : @xmath73 note that these threshold corrections , when extrapolated down to the weak scale and added to the rg - extrapolated values of the @xmath12-quark mass and the ckm mixing parameters , yield results within @xmath74 range of the experimental values at @xmath75 .    at the weak scale",

    "given that this model requires a large threshold correction to have a consistent fit in the fermion sector , we expect some correlation between the two corrections . to show it quantitatively , we have chosen the simplest case of msugra - type gut scale spectrum , as an illustration , although our results do not depend on the assumption of msugra . here",

    "we now turn to a discussion of proton lifetime in our model . as experimental limits on proton lifetimes keep increasing , many simple susy - gut models have either been ruled out or become more and more constrained .",
    "it is therefore important to ensure that any gut model for neutrino masses is consistent with those limits .",
    "as is well known , the dominant contributions to proton decay comes from color triplet higgsino exchange in these modes  @xcite and can in general lead to large proton decay amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that one way to suppress this amplitude without invoking cancellations is to choose appropriate flavor structure for the yukawa couplings .",
    "the current model falls into this category where the existence of small elements in @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath52 matrices leads to the expectation that we should be able to satisfy the proton decay constraints without any cancellation .",
    "let us now see how this occurs using the fit for yukawa couplings we obtained in the previous section .",
    "the colored higgs triplets , @xmath89 : @xmath90 responsible for proton decay in our model arise from @xmath91 multiplets .",
    "once the triplet fields @xmath92 and @xmath93 are integrated out , both @xmath94 and @xmath95 operators leading to proton decay emerge : @xmath96 the color triplet @xmath97 fields are linear combinations of six fields , two of them arising from two @xmath98 s , three of them arising from @xmath99 and one from * 210*. this leads to a @xmath100 dimensional mass matrix for the triplets : @xmath101 .",
    "one can write the dimension five operators in terms of the couplings @xmath87 , @xmath102 and @xmath52 as follows : @xmath103 similarly , we can write @xmath104 operator ( and change @xmath105 s to different coefficients @xmath106 ) . the coefficient @xmath107 is @xmath108 and the coefficients @xmath105 and @xmath106 are also given by the components of @xmath109 .",
    "the proton decay amplitude can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 using the c s and @xmath105s given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chf ] ) , and @xmath112 is the nucleon matrix element of the three - quark operator . in our calculation",
    "we use @xmath113 tev as a typical value for the first two generation squark masses ( to satisfy the lhc lower bound ) , and similarly @xmath114 gev as a typical wino mass .",
    "the proton decay width can be written simply as : @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the hadronic form factors , typically of @xmath117 .",
    "assuming that the colored higgs from * 10 * s are the lightest , we find the largest contribution to the @xmath118 to be arising from @xmath119 . using the values of @xmath88 from the eq .",
    "( [ hfh ] ) and varying @xmath120 within a factor 5 of the gut scale , we find that the partial lifetime of proton in this mode can be as large as @xmath121 years .",
    "if however , we lower @xmath18 to 5 ( @xmath119 will be smaller in this case ) , or raise the squark mass to 1.5 tev , the lifetime can be be as large as @xmath122 years .",
    "the partial lifetimes for other flavors of @xmath123 are found to be larger .",
    "similarly , the partial lifetimes for other decay modes , e.g. , @xmath124 are found to be much larger of @xmath125 years .",
    "we should emphasize here that , in order to generate these numbers , we did not invoke any cancellation .",
    "the smallness of the elements of the yukawa coupling matrices are sufficient in suppressing the decay rates .",
    "we note that the lifetime of the mode @xmath126 is within the search limit of the proposed hyper - kamiokande experiment  @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the predictions of a minimal @xmath0 model of flavor with dominant type ii seesaw form for neutrino masses , where the forms of the yukawa couplings for the two * 10 * higgs fields and one * 126 * higgs field are determined dynamically by flavon vevs at the minimum of the @xmath8-invariant flavon potential with an additional @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "the model has eleven parameters including complex phases and is , thus , a relatively economical one when compared to other models discussed in the literature .",
    "it gives a very good fit to the charged fermion masses and the ckm parameters , and it also predicts the neutrino mixing angles @xmath127 , @xmath128 as well as @xmath129 in agreement with observation .",
    "furthermore , it predicts a non - zero value for @xmath3 between @xmath130 , which is in the current experimentally preferred range . with more accurate determination of @xmath3 and its correlation with @xmath128",
    ", the model could be tested in near future .",
    "the model also predicts a normal hierarchy for the neutrinos and hence an effective neutrino mass in neutrino - less double beta decay which is a few milli - electron - volts and is thus not observable in the current round of the searches for this process . the proton lifetime for @xmath131 decay mode can be @xmath132 years .",
    "finally , the successful fit for fermion masses require the higgs mass to be below 129 gev in this model and put lower bounds on the third generation squark masses which are well within the reach of lhc .",

    "<S> in a recent paper , a minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) @xmath0 based unified model of flavor for quarks and leptons was proposed with two * 10 * and one * 126 * contributing to fermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> an important aspect of this model is that yukawa couplings emerge dynamically from minimization of the flavon potential , thereby reducing the number of parameters considerably . </S>",
    "<S> we make a detailed numerical analysis of this model for fermion mixings including susy threshold effects at the tev scale and type - i corrections to a type - ii dominant seesaw for neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> this is a single - step breaking model with susy @xmath1 broken at the grand unified theory ( gut)-scale of @xmath2 gev to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal model has only 11 parameters , and therefore , the charged fermion fits predict the masses ( up to an overall scale ) and mixings in the neutrino sector . </S>",
    "<S> we present correlations for the different predictions in the neutrino mixing parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental `` large '' @xmath3 value of @xmath4 can be obtained by a simple extension of the minimal model . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that proton decay mode @xmath5 has a partial lifetime of @xmath6 yrs , which is within reach of the next round of planned proton decay searches . </S>",
    "<S> the successful fit for fermion masses requires the higgs mass to be below 129 gev in this model . </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs mass lies between 120 - 128 gev , as suggested by the recent lhc data , we find a lower limit on the light stop mass of 755 ( 211 ) gev for @xmath7 .    </S>",
