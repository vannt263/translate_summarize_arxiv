    "novel solid state devices that can control spin degrees of freedom of individual electrons@xcite , or discrete quantum states in superconducting circuits@xcite , show promise in realizing the ideal of the completely controllable two - state quantum system , weakly coupled to its environment , that is the essential starting point for qubit operation in quantum computation . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", these experimental successes also bring us close to embodying the ideal test of quantum coherence as envisioned by leggett many years ago@xcite , in which a simple quantum system is placed in a known initial state , is allowed to evolve for a definite time @xmath3 under the action of its own hamiltonian and under the influence of decoherence from the environment , and is then measured .",
    "recent experiments , starting with @xcite , show that this ideal test can be implemented in practice .",
    "the decay of quantum oscillations due to environmental decoherence is now@xcite sufficiently weak that some tens of coherent oscillations can be observed .",
    "if quantum computation is to become a reality , it is believed@xcite that these systems will eventually need to achieve even lower levels of decoherence , such that thousands or tens of thousands of coherent oscillations could be observed .",
    "this prospect of producing experiments with ultra - long coherence times in quantum two state systems offers a new challenge for theoretical modelling of decoherence . despite the many years of work@xcite following on leggett s initial proposals ,",
    "there has never been a full , systematic analysis of the most popular description of these systems , the spin - boson model , in the limit of very weak coupling to the environment .    in this paper",
    "we provide an exact analysis of the weak coupling limit of the spin boson model for the ohmic heat bath , and in the low temperature limit . in this limit",
    "the born approximation ( to the self energy ) should become essentially exact , and we make no other approximations in our solutions  in particular , no markov approximation is made .",
    "as other workers have recently emphasized@xcite , understanding the details of the short - time dynamics of this model is especially crucial for the operation of these systems as qubits .",
    "we find important , new , non - markovian effects in this regime . at lowest order in the born expansion of the self energy superoperator ,",
    "the time dynamics of the model rigorously separates into a sum of strictly exponential pieces ( the usual  @xmath4 \" and  @xmath5 \" decays of the bloch - redfield model ) plus two distinct non - exponential pieces that arise , technically speaking , from two different kinds of branch cuts in the laplace transform of the solution of the generalized master equation that we obtain .",
    "these two contributions both have power - law forms at long times , @xmath6 , and thus formally dominate the exponentially - decaying parts .",
    "but more interesting is that they both give new structure to the time evolution at intermediate times @xmath3 , @xmath7 ; this structure typically occurs for @xmath3 on the order of the oscillation period .",
    "( here , @xmath8 is a high frequency cut - off of the bath modes , defining the very short time regime , @xmath9 , which is of no interest here . )",
    "we can explain our results in the language of the double - well potential , where the two quantum states are  left \" and  right \" ( @xmath10/@xmath11 ) , the @xmath12 state is pure @xmath10 , and the system oscillates in time via tunneling from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the first branch - cut contribution is most important in the unbiased case ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 energies degenerate ) and it causes the system , starting immediately in the first quantum oscillation , to spend more time in the @xmath11 well , that is , the _ opposite _ well from the one the system is in initially .",
    "the second branch - cut contribution , present when the system is biased , adds to the amplitude of the coherent oscillation , but dies out after an intermediate time which scales like the inverse square root of the interaction strength @xmath1 with the bath .",
    "this _ prompt loss of coherence _",
    ", whose amplitude is proportional to @xmath1 , changes qualitatively the picture of the initial decay of coherence that is so important for discussions of fault - tolerant quantum computation@xcite .    finally , we set up the next - order born approximation and do some initial calculations with it .",
    "this involves computing the self - energy of the master equation to fourth order in the system - bath coupling . at this order",
    "the self energy is a sum of thousands of separate terms ; but we find that it is feasible to compute various quantities of physical interest with the aid of mathematica . as an illustration , we provide a full calculation of the steady state system density matrix to order @xmath1 in the limit of low temperature , which requires the fourth - order self energy . given the enormous complexity of the calculation , we find a very simple result for the corrections to steady state ; they turn out to be identical to those for the thermodynamic equilibrium state calculated to the same order in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we are able to establish rigorously a very strong form of ergodicity for the spin boson model at this order .",
    "we are interested in studying the time dependence of the system density matrix @xmath13 with a time - independent system hamiltonian , and in the presence of a fixed coupling to an environment .",

    "this means that @xmath104 is nonanalytic at @xmath75  it has a branch point there .",
    "thus , the exact solutions @xmath105 have extra analytic structure not present in the markov approximation , and the real - time dynamics @xmath106 has qualitatively different features in addition to the pole contributions we have just discussed .",

    "thus , the solutions to the gme @xmath113 also have three branch points in the complex plane . we find by numerical study that the exact solutions still have four poles as before , which , for small @xmath1 , have nearly ( but not exactly ) the same pole positions and residues as in the markov approximation .    thus , the structure of the solutions in the complex @xmath77 plane is as shown in fig .",
    "the locations of the branch cuts are chosen for computational convenience , as discussed shortly .",
    "given this branch - cut structure , the inverse laplace transform ( the bromwich integral ) is evaluated by closing the contour as shown .",

    "the contributions of the second and third branch cuts are complex conjugates of each other , so we will be discussing them together .",

    ".    we will do a detailed study of these branch - cut contributions for @xmath126 .",

    "let us survey , then , the peculiar features that this branch cut contribution introduces into the time response @xmath136 . visualizing the @xmath129 spin - boson model",
    "as a symmetric double well system coupled to its environment , the bc1 piece being negative means that , if the system is initially in the left well , it will , in the course of coherently tunnelling back and forth , spend more time in the _ right _ well ! this effect becomes strongest at long time , much longer than @xmath5 , for in this regime the pole contributions are exponentially small , while the bc1 contribution decays like a power law .",
    "experimentally it may be hard to see the effect in this regime ( on account of finite - temperature effects , for example ) , so it is important to note that this memory effect appears already at early times , indicating that already in the first couple of coherent oscillations , there will be an excess amplitude in the right - well excursions as compared with the left - well excursions , by an amount proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "we judge , on the basis of a variety of evidence@xcite , that the born approximation should be reliable up to @xmath1 s of order @xmath137 ; thus , experiments that look at coherent oscillations accurately at the percent level ( which , it seems , will ultimately be necessary for performing quantum computation ) could readily see this bc1 effect .",
    "we note several other interesting features of our solution for @xmath129 .",
    "taking into account the non - markovian effects , we can do a more precise calculation of the pole positions and residues ( only poles 3 and 4 contribute ) .",

    "these expressions are obtained as systematic expansions in the small parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and they match a direct numerical evaluation of the pole positions very well up to @xmath1 s of a few percent . for the corresponding pole residues we find the simple result in leading order @xmath147 .",
    "this would be impossible in a markovian theory , in which @xmath148 , so that @xmath149 would be exactly 1 to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact this excess pole residue is exactly what is needed to cancel out the initial value of the bc1 contribution to @xmath136 .",
    "we note that our results for the residues differ from the weak - coupling expressions in the literature@xcite ( we are not aware of prior reports on the renormalization factors @xmath140 and @xmath150 ) .      for the biased model ( @xmath151 ) the bc2 contributions become nonzero ; we find that they give other peculiar non - exponential corrections to the solution @xmath136 , very different from the bc1 contribution .",

    "the @xmath2 corrections to pole positions , given in an earlier section , are unaffected by inclusion of @xmath194 ; however , @xmath2 corrections to residues of both pole 1 ( @xmath75 ) and pole 2 for @xmath225 and @xmath58 are affected by @xmath194 . @xmath2",
    "corrections to @xmath226 residues , and @xmath227 residues of poles 2 and poles 3 and 4 are determined entirely by @xmath228 ; they do _ not _ have contributions from @xmath194 .",
    "naturally , many more regimes could be studied using the present approach . for finite temperature",
    "the time evolution is very different at long times , but it is essentially the same as the @xmath95 evolution when @xmath229 .",
    "recently , there has been interest in varying both the system@xcite and bath@xcite initial conditions , as well as in varying the model of the bath density of states@xcite .",
    "for all these circumstances , the systematic born expansion procedure we report here can be done .",
    "it is clear on general grounds that the appearance of branch cut contributions will not be restricted to the ohmic model , however , the ohmic case is special in that the size branch cut contribution is not governed by any small parameter . for any superohmic spectral density of the form @xmath230 at low frequencies ( @xmath231 ) , @xmath66 will have a power - law dependence at long time , and thus @xmath104 will have a branch point at @xmath75 .",
    "however , the magnitude of the branch cut contribution in the general case goes like @xmath232 .",
    "so , non - exponential contributions to the dynamics vanish in the physical limit in all these other cases .",
    "our hope is that , using the present and further exact calculations of the weak - coupling behavior of the spin - boson model , a tool will be made available to permit precision experiments to test the validity of the model ( which , at present , is only phenomenologically justified ) in various physical situations of present interest in quantum information .",
    "a fundamentally correct , experimentally verified theory of the system and its environment should ultimately be of great value in finding a satisfactory qubit for the construction of a quantum information processor .",
