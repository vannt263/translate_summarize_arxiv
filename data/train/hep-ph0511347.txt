    "physical processes at ongoing and upcoming colliders involve the production and subsequent decay of heavy , unstable particles ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  ) .",
    "their resonant production allows a precise determination of particle properties .",
    "however , weak - coupling perturbation theory ( pt ) is known to fail in the resonant region  @xcite .",
    "the break - down of ordinary pt is due to the appearance of a second small parameter , besides the coupling constant : the width @xmath5 of the unstable particle in unit of its mass @xmath6 .",
    "a self - energy resummation allows one to take into account finite width effects , however this procedure introduces some arbitrariness often reflected in gauge - dependent results .",
    "additionally , there is no clear prescription on how to improuve systematically the accuracy of the results .",
    "we start from the observation that the presence of two small parameters is _ the _ characteristic feature of the problem , so that in a theory which formulates correctly the double expansion in the coupling and in @xmath7 all other issues ( gauge invariance , resummation ) should follow automatically . as is typical in multi - scale problems , we use effective theory methods to formulated this expansion .",
    "this provides us with a computational scheme for performing calculations of resonant production of unstable particles at any accuracy .",
    "in  @xcite we presented how an effective theory approach allows one to describe processes with resonant unstable particles in intermediate stages . we applied the method to the description of the resonant production of a scalar , heavy particle .",
    "this simple toy - model allowed us to study the problem of treating consistently finite width effects while keeping all technical difficulties to a minimum .    here",
    "we consider @xmath0-pair production close to threshold at an @xmath8 collider .",
    "elements of the calculation were first presented in  @xcite .",
    "we consider specifically the process @xmath9 at threshold @xmath10 and the counting is @xmath11 .",
    "this process is crucial for the precise determination of the @xmath0 mass and a lot of work has been carried out in the last years to improuve the accuracy of the description of @xmath12 mediated four - fermion final states .",
    "recently the full @xmath13 to @xmath8 to four - fermion has been completed  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on obtaining results that are valid near threshold , where ordinary pt and the double pole approximation break down .",
    "the first step in the construction of the effective theory is to integrate out hard fluctuations @xmath14 ( so called factorizable corrections ) , for which there is no quantum - interference with resonant , slowly propagating particles .",
    "this gives rise to the hard matching coefficients of an effective theory where only soft , collinear or resonant modes are dynamical .",
    "the hard matching coefficients are determined by matching onshell green functions in full theory to operators in the effective theory .",
    "notice that the precise definition of what are the `` hard '' modes depends on the process and on the observable under consideration .",
    "the splitting between hard and dynamical does not involve a cut - off , instead in dimensional regularization this splitting can be achieved with the strategy of regions  @xcite .",
    "once the matching coefficients and the effective operators have been calculated at the required order in pt , calculations can be done suitably in the effective theory framework . here",
    "we will outline how to organize the lowest order calculation and the classes of terms contributing to the first order correction to it .",
    "the aim is to make transparent how the calculation can be systematically extended to higher orders .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) contribution is obtained by tree - level matching of the on - shell operators and by resuming onshell one - loop self - energies in the propagators .",
    "specifically , at lo one needs    * tree level matching for the production vertex @xmath15 @xmath16 }      e_l\\right)\\left(\\omega_-^{*i}\\omega_+^{*j}\\right)\\>,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denote the non - relativistic vector fields with mass dimension 3/2 for the @xmath18 bosons .",
    "notice that at lo only the @xmath19 amplitude contributes ; * resummation of @xmath13 onshell self - energies in the propagators @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the hard matching coefficient and @xmath22 denotes the leading contribution @xmath23 .",
    "the w bosons are then described by a non - relativistic lagrangian similar to nrqcd ; * tree level matching for the decay vertices @xmath24 @xmath25    to obtain the lo amplitude , one derives the feynman rules corresponding to these effective operators and combines the various elements .",
    "the diagram contributing at lo in the effective theory is shown in fig .",
