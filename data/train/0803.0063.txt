    "theoretical considerations suggest that gas in low mass elliptical galaxies may also be in the state of outflow @xcite .",
    "the mass and energy budget of the ism in this case is maintained by winds from evolved stars and type ia supernovae .",
    "the overall x - ray radiation from a galaxy is a superposition of these ( and possibly other ) components , their relative importance being defined by the morphological type of the galaxy and its star - formation and merger history .",
    "our close - by neighbor , m31 galaxy gives a unique opportunity to explore a `` full - size '' spiral galaxy similar to the milky way without complications brought about by projection and absorption effects , often hampering studies of our own galaxy .",
    "not surprisingly , it has been extensively investigated by every major observatory of the past decades .",
    "observations by the _ einstein _",
    "observatory demonstrated that x - ray binaries account for the most of the x - ray emission from the galaxy @xcite .",
    "using the complete set of _ einstein _ data @xcite constrained possible amount of ionized gas in the bulge of the galaxy by @xmath7 .",
    "based on the _ rosat _ observations , @xcite found evidence for extended emission component with luminosity of @xmath8 erg / s in the 0.24 kev band .",
    "they suggested , that this emission may be of truly diffuse origin or due to a new class of x - ray sources .",
    "the unresolved emission from m31 was investigated further by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in all these studies",
    "the existence of a soft emission component with temperature @xmath9 kev has been confirmed , although different authors suggested different explanations of its origin . with advent of chandra and xmm - newton ,",
    "the consensus seemed to be achieved in favor of truly diffuse origin of the soft emission component @xcite .",
    "however , recent progress in understanding the nature of the galactic ridge emission as a superposition of a large number of faint stellar type sources @xcite , made it worth to revisit the problem of the origin of extended emission in m31 . also , with more chandra and xmm - newton observations , more accurate and detailed investigations became possible .",
    "recently @xcite analyzed large chandra dataset of m31 bulge observations and demonstrated presence of both ionized gas and emission of faint compact sources associated with old stellar population .",
    "moreover , they revealed peculiar morphology of the gas emission and suggested that the x - ray gas in the bulge of m31 may be in the state of outflow .    in the present paper",
    "we combine extensive set of chandra and xmm - newton observations to obtain a broad band and large field view of the x - ray emission originating in and around the bulge of m31 .",
    "we restrict our study to the central region of @xmath10 in radius , covered well by chandra and xmm - newton observations currently available in the public archives of these observatories ( fig.[fig : rgb ] ) .",
    "the investigated region has the linear size of @xmath11 kpc along the major axis of the galaxy , but extends out to @xmath12 kpc along the plane of the galaxy in the minor axis direction , due to rather large inclination angle of m31 , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we assume the distance to andromeda of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the galactic absorption towards m31 is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data and its reduction .",
    "we introduce our results in section 3 , where we present the spatial distribution , morphology and the spectra of the extended emission . in section 4 the origin ,",
    "properties and physical parameters of different components are discussed and in section 5 we summarize our results .",
    "we combine data from chandra and xmm - newton satellites adding their benefits together .",
    "the primal advantage of chandra is its good angular resolution which allows us to resolve individual x - ray binaries everywhere including the very central region of the bulge .",
    "xmm - newton provided better coverage of m31 and collected more photons , thanks to its larger effective area .",
    "it is more suitable to study the outer part of m31 . on the other hand",
    "the higher and less predictable background of xmm - newton complicates study of low surface brightness regions .",
    "we used @xmath16 archival chandra observations listed in table 1 , taken between 13.10.1999 and 23.05.2004 . for the analysis we extracted data of the acis - i",
    "array except for obs - id 1575 where we used only the s3 chip .",
    "the pattern of available chandra observations allows us to study the central @xmath17 region .",
    "the data reduction was performed using standard ciao software package tools ( ciao version 3.4 ; caldb version 3.4.1 ) . for each observations we filtered out the flare contaminated intervals , excluding the time intervals where the count rate deviated by more than @xmath18 from the mean value .",

    "center of the m31 is marked with a cross .",
    "north is up and east is left.,width=321 ]    crucial for the analysis of the low surface brightness outer regions is the accuracy of the background subtraction . in treating the chandra background",
    "we generally followed the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "we determined the level of the instrumental background using the stowed data set . in the stowed position of acis detectors the sky emission",
    "is blocked and only the instrumental background gives a contribution .",
    "as demonstrated in the above - mentioned paper , although the instrumental background level varies with time , its spectrum remains unchanged .",
    "the effective area of chandra is negligible above 9 kev and the count rate is dominated by the instrumental background . therefore the @xmath20 count rates can be used to renormalize background spectra obtained from the stowed datasets . in dealing with cosmic background we took into account that it consists of the soft emission associated with the galaxy and harder extragalactic component and treated them separately . for the soft galactic component we used the best fit spectrum from @xcite . for the extragalactic background we took into account that some fraction of it has been resolved in our data analysis procedure and removed along with x - ray binaries . using the incompleteness function from @xcite , that was obtained using essentially the same data set",
    ", we estimated that our point source detection sensitivity in the outer regions is @xmath21 .",
    "we used the sensitivity for outermost regions because the cxb subtraction plays role only in these regions where the surface brightness of the source emission is low .",
    "this point source sensitivity results in the resolved cxb fraction of @xmath22 , according to @xcite .",
    "the galactic and cosmic backgrounds were subtracted from the vignetting corrected images and profiles .",

    "see the text for the absorption corrected values .",
    "+ @xmath24 the @xmath25 ratios were converted to @xmath26 ratios assuming two values of the k - band mass - to - light ratio , 0.7 ( first number ) and 1.0 ; the uncertainty given in the parenthesis corresponds to @xmath27    [ tab : xk ]",
    "we showed that a broad - band emission component exists in m31 which ( i ) follows the k - band light distribution and ( ii ) its @xmath28 kev x / k ratio is identical to that of m32 and milky way .",
    "these suggest beyond reasonable doubt that this component has similar origin to the galactic ridge x - ray emission of the milky way @xcite .",
    "namely , it is associated with the old stellar population and is a superposition of a large number of weak sources of stellar type , the main contributors in the 210 kev band being cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries @xcite .",
    "the x / k ratios are compatible between all three galaxies in the 210 kev band , but in the soft band they differ in m31 and m32 ( table 4 ) . in the inner bulge",
    "this difference is clearly due to the contribution of the soft emission from the ionized gas , as discussed below .",
    "although we chose the outer bulge region as far as possible along the major axis of the galaxy , where the soft x - ray brightness follows the k - band profile , some residual contribution from the gas can not be entirely excluded .",
    "therefore it is not clear if this difference reflects genuine difference between properties and/or content of x - ray emitting stellar populations in these two galaxies . due to large systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the milky way value is formally compatible with both galaxies and any quantitative comparison is inconclusive at this point .",
    "there are several arguments which suggest that the excess soft component has a non - stellar origin .",
    "the most important is the morphology of the excess emission , namely the striking difference from the distribution of the near - infrared light ( fig.[fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "as no significant color gradients are observed in the bulge of m31 @xcite , its stellar content must be sufficiently uniform and can not give rise to the observed non - uniformities in the x / k ratio .",
    "enhanced x - ray to k - band ratio could be explained if a notable young population was present in the bulge , which is also not the case @xcite . with the stellar origin",
    "excluded , it is plausible that the soft excess emission is of truly diffuse nature and originates from ionized gas of @xmath29 kev temperature .    to study the physical properties of the ionized gas we use a rectangular region on the south - eastern side of the galaxy , to avoid the complications due to attenuation by the spiral arms on the north - western side .",
    "the size of the region is @xmath30 along the major axis and @xmath31 along the minor axis of the galaxy . from the spectral fit ,",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of the soft component in the @xmath32 energy range is @xmath33 , after the absorption and bolometric correction the total bolometric luminosity is @xmath34 assuming galactic column density . from the emission measure of the gas , @xmath35 , we estimate that the mass of the gas in the studied volume is of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "we note , that assuming the symmetry between the north - western and south - eastern sides of the galaxy , the total quantities for the mass and bolometric luminosity are twice the quoted values .",
    "the average number density is about @xmath37 .",
    "the cooling time of the gas is @xmath38 million years .",
    "we also applied a two temperature model to the soft emission and obtained for the two components : @xmath39 kev , @xmath40 kev , bolometric luminosities of @xmath41 and @xmath42 erg / s , total masses of @xmath43 and @xmath44 m@xmath45 and cooling times of @xmath46 and @xmath47 million years .",
    "we mention that the above computed values strongly depend on the applied spectral model .",
    "the morphology of the gas indicates that it is not in the hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "it suggests rather , that gas is outflowing from the bulge in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the mass and energy budget of the outflow can be maintained by the mass loss from the evolved stars and type ia supernovae .",
    "@xcite estimated the mass loss rate from evolved stars for elliptical galaxies @xmath48",
    ". this rate can be applicable to the bulge of m31 as the stellar populations are similar .",
    "the k - band luminosity of this region is @xmath49 .",
    "the estimated total mass loss rate is @xmath50 .",
    "the stellar yields produce the total amount of the observed gas on a timescale of @xmath51 million years which is shorter than the cooling timescale of the gas .    to estimate the energy input from type ia supernovae we use results of @xcite who give the supernova rate of @xmath52 for e and s0 galaxies , where @xmath53 per century .",
    "assuming that one supernova releases @xmath54 into the interstellar medium , we obtain about @xmath55 energy that goes into ism . the minimal energy required to lift the gas in the gravitational potential of the galaxy",
    "can be calculated from @xmath56 @xcite . with",
    "@xmath57 @xcite we obtain @xmath58 .",
    "if the gas is heated to the observed temperature by supernovae , it requires @xmath59 erg / s .",
    "this estimates indicate that the energy input from supernovae is approximately @xmath60 times larger than the minimal energy required to drive a galactic wind from the galaxy , similar to the result of @xcite for low - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "type ia supernovae will also contribute to the chemical enrichment of ism with iron - peak elements .",
    "typically @xmath61 of iron is provided by each sn ia event @xcite , that gives about @xmath62 of iron per year .",
    "assuming complete mixing of the supernova ejecta with the stellar wind material we would expect the iron abundance in the hot ism @xmath63 by mass , which exceeds the solar value of @xmath64 @xcite by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "the observed spectra are inconsistent with high iron abundance in simple one- or two - component thermal models , but these models can not adequately describe the spectra anyway , therefore this result can not be used as a conclusive argument .",
    "on the other hand , the discrepancy between high predicted and low observed abundance of iron is a well - known problem for elliptical galaxies , where type ia supernovae also plays important role in thermal and chemical evolution of the ism ; it has been addressed in a number of studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we also note , that although the iron is the primary element by mass in the type ia supernovae ejecta , the ism will be also enriched by other elements , most significantly by nickel .",
    "the detailed analysis of this problem is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "assuming that the gas leaves the galaxy in a steady state wind along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the disk , the outflow speed @xmath66 can be calculated from @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the average gas density estimated above and @xmath69 is the radius of the base of the imaginary cylinder filled with the outflowing gas .",
    "this calculation gives @xmath70 which is smaller by a factor of few than the local sound speed .",
    "such a slow sub - sonic motion of the gas can not explain the observed elongated shape of the gas distribution , which may be related to the the magnetic fields and galactic rotation .",
    "we can use the fact that the shadow from the 10-kpc star - forming ring is present to estimate the extent of the gas along the axis perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "the angular distance of the shadow from the center is @xmath71 , giving the `` vertical '' extent of the gas of @xmath72 kpc .",
    "the @xmath73 times higher x - ray to k - band ratios observed in the spiral arms ( table 4 ) and their different emission spectrum ( fig . [ fig : spectra ] ) suggest that x - ray emission from spiral arms has different nature than the bulge .",
    "as spiral arms are associated with star - formation , an obvious candidate is x - ray emission from young stellar objects ( protostars and pre - main sequence stars ) and young stars , which are well - known sources of x - ray radiation @xcite .    as x - ray emission from the spiral arms",
    "is associated with young objects , it is natural to characterize it with @xmath74 ratio .",
    "we compute this ratio for the regions used in spectral analysis .",
    "the fir flux was determined from the @xmath75 spitzer image , @xmath76 . in computing this value",
    "we subtracted the blank - sky background of nearby fields . to convert it to sfr we used results of ir spectral fits from @xcite , which gave @xmath77 m@xmath78/yr for the m31 distance .",
    "thus we obtained the star - formation rate of @xmath79 in the region used for the analysis .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the same region is @xmath80 in the @xmath81 band . after subtracting the x - ray emission due to the old stellar population",
    "we obtain @xmath82 energy . from this",
    "we can compute @xmath83 .",
    "this value is @xmath84 of the total @xmath85 arising from hmxbs which is @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we investigated the origin of unresolved x - ray emission from m31 using chandra and xmm - newton data .",
    "we demonstrated that it consists of three different components :    1 .",
    "broad - band emission associated with old population , similar to the galactic ridge emission in the milky way .",
    "it is a a combined emission of a large number of weak unresolved sources of stellar type , the main contribution being from cataclysmic variables and active binaries .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of this component approximately follows the distribution of k - band light .",
    "the absorption corrected x - ray to k - band luminosity ratios are compatible with the milky way values .",
    "the total luminosity of this component inside central @xmath87 is of the order of @xmath88 erg / s in the @xmath89 kev band .",
    "soft emission localized in the inner bulge of the galaxy along its minor axis .",
    "this emission is from ionized gas with the temperature of the order of @xmath90 ev , although its spectrum can not be adequately described by a simple one- or two - temperature model of optically - thin emission from a gas in a collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath91 kev luminosity in the central @xmath92 area is @xmath93 erg / s , the absorption corrected bolometric luminosity is @xmath94 erg / s .",
    "the total mass of the gas is @xmath95 , its cooling time @xmath96 myrs .",
    "the surface brightness distribution is drastically different from the stellar light distribution , it is significantly elongated along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
