    "in cold dark matter cosmology , the initially smooth distribution of matter in the universe is expected to collapse into a complex network of filaments and voids , structures which have been termed the `` cosmic web '' .",
    "the filamentary distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe has been revealed in detail by recent large galaxy redshift surveys such as the 2dfgrs ( colless et al .",
    "2001 , baugh et al .",
    "2004 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , stoughton et al .",
    "2002 , doroshkevich et al . 2004 ) and the 2@xmath19 all sky survey ( 2mass , maller et al .",
    "numerical simulations successfully reproduce this network ( jenkins et al . 1998 ; colberg et al .",
    "2004 ) and indicate that galaxies are only the tip of the iceberg in this cosmic web ( katz et al .",
    "1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations suggest that at the present epoch , in addition to dark matter and galaxies , the filaments are also composed of a mixture of cool , photoionised gas ( the low@xmath0 remnants of the   forest ) and a shock heated , low - density gaseous phase at temperatures between @xmath20  k and @xmath21  k that contains most of the baryonic mass , the `` warm - hot '' intergalactic medium ( whim , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "observational constraints on the physical conditions , distribution , a nd metal enrichment of gas in the low - redshift cosmic web are currently quite limited .",
    "the existence of the whim appears to be a robust prediction of cosmological simulations ( dav et al .",
    "thus , observational efforts are increasingly being invested in the search for whim gas and , more generally , the gaseous filamentary structures predicted by the models .",
    "large - scale gaseous filaments have been detected in x - ray emission ( wang et al .",
    "1997 ; scharf et al .",
    "2000 ; tittley & henriksen 2001 ; rines et al 2001 ) .",
    "however , x - ray emission studies with current facilities predominantly reveal gas which is hotter and denser than the whim ; this x - ray emitting gas is not expected to contain a substantial portion of the present - epoch baryons ( dav et al .",
    "the most promising method for observing the whim in the near term is to search for uv ( o@xmath4roman6 , ne@xmath4roman8 ) and x - ray ( o@xmath4roman7 , o@xmath4roman8 , ne@xmath4roman9 ) absorption lines due to whim gas in the spectra of background qsos / agns ( tripp et al . 2000 , 2001 ; savage et al . 2002,2005 ; nicastro et al . 2002 ; bergeron et al . 2002 ; richter et al . 2004 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2004 ; danforth & shull 2005 ) .",
    "while absorption lines provide a sensitive and powerful probe of the whim , the pencil - beam nature of the measurement along a sight line provides little information on the context of the absorption , e.g. , whether the lines arise in an individual galaxy disk / halo , a galaxy group , or lower - density regions of a large - scale filament or void .",
    "thus , to understand the nature of highly ionised absorbers at low redshifts , several groups are pursuing deep galaxy redshift surveys and observations of qsos behind well - defined galaxy groups or clusters .",
    "for example , to study gas located in large - scale filaments , bregman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have searched for absorption lines indicative of the whim in regions between galaxy clusters / superclusters and have identified some candidates . in this paper , we carry out a similar search as part of a broader program that combines a large _ hst _ survey of low@xmath0 o@xmath4roman6 absorption systems observed on sight lines to low@xmath0 quasars ( tripp et al . 2004 ) and a ground based survey to measure the redshifts and properties of the galaxies foreground to the background qsos .",
    "the ground based survey is done in two steps : first , multi - band ( u , b , v , r and i ) imagery is obtained to identify the galaxies and to estimate their photometric redshifts .",
    "then , spectroscopic redshifts are obtained for the galaxies that are potentially ( according to the photometric redhshifts ) at lower redshift that the background object . as part of the large _ hst _ survey ,",
    "we have observed the quasar hs0624 + 6907 ( @xmath22 = 0.3700 ) with the e140 m echelle mode of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope_. we have also obtained multiband images and spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies in the 0624 field .",
    "the sight line to 0624 passes by several foreground abell clusters (   [ sec : abell_clusters ] ) and provides an opportunity to search for gas in large - scale filaments .",
    "we shall show that gas ( absorption systems ) and galaxies are detected at the redshifts of the structures delineated by the abell clusters in this direction . while the absorbing gas is intergalactic , and it is likely that we are probing gas in cosmic web filaments , the properties of these absorbers are surprising . instead of low - metallicity whim gas , we predominantly find cool , photoionised , and high - metallicity gas in these large - scale structures .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and data reduction procedures are described in  2 , including _ hst_/stis and _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( ) observations as well as ground - based imaging and galaxy redshift measurements . in  3 , we present information on the foreground environments probed by the 0624 sight line , derived from the literature on abell clusters and from our new galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the absorption - line measurement methods are described in  4 , and we investigate the physical state and metallicity of the absorbers in  5 .",
    "section 6 reviews the properties of the full sample of ly@xmath16 lines derived from the stis spectrum with emphasis on the search for broad ly@xmath16 lines .",
    "section 7 discusses the implications of this study , and we summarize our conclusions in  8 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath23  , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the echelle spectrograph was used with the e140 m grating which provides a resolution of 7  fwhm and covers the 1150@xmath261730    range with only a few small gaps between orders at wavelengths greater than 1630   .",
    "the @xmath27 entrance aperture was used to minimize the effect of the wings of the line spread function .",

    "we have retrieved the  spectra from the archive and have reduced the data using calfuse version 2.4.0 as described in tripp et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . because the spectra in the individual channels have modest s / n ratios , we have aligned and combined all available lif channels to form the final spectra that we used for our measurements ( we find that combining all available lif data does not degrade the spectral resolution ) .",

    "one of the primary goals of our low@xmath0 qso absorption line program is to study the connections between galaxies and absorption systems .",
    "these studies require good imaging ( for galaxy target selection and information on individual galaxies of interest ) followed by optical spectroscopy for accurate redshift measurements . to initiate the galaxy - absorber study toward 0624",

    "the ne3 , se13 , and se5 galaxies , which morphologically appear to be early - type galaxies , have colours and magnitudes consistent with the `` red sequence '' colour - magnitude relation observed in clusters ( e.g. , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; mcintosh et al .",
    "2005 ) ; these galaxies are likely s0s ( the other 7 galaxies have blue colours characteristic of late types ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the group at @xmath75 = , albeit uncertain , is more comparable to those of elliptical - dominated groups than spiral - rich groups ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ; zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) .",
    "regardless of whether the group is elliptical- or spiral - rich , it is surprising that we find a large number of cool , photoionised clouds in the intragroup medium (  [ ss : z064 ] ) .",
    "in the hot intragroup medium of an elliptical - rich group , h@xmath4roman1 lines should be extremely broad and weak , but instead we find strong , narrow lines ( see figure  [ fig : hi00635 ] ) . even in the cooler gas",
    "predicted to be found in late - type dominated groups , the h@xmath4roman1 lines should be broader .",
    "we could entertain models of cooling intragroup gas , but in such models o@xmath4roman6 is expected to be stronger .",
    "likewise , if the intragroup gas is a multiphase medium with cooler clouds ( which cause the h@xmath4roman1 absorption lines ) embedded in a hotter phase , then we might expect to detect o@xmath4roman6 from the interface between the phases ( fox et al .",
    "2005 ) , unless conduction is somehow suppressed .",
    "the lack of evidence of hot gas leads us to question whether this group is a bound , virialized system .",
    "an alternative possibility is that our sight line passes along the long axis of a large - scale filamentary structure in the cosmic web . in this case",
    ", the projection of the galaxies and ly@xmath16 clouds along the sight line could give a false impression of a group in which hot gas would be expected .",
    "however , in cosmological simulations of large - scale filaments , whim gas is expected to be widespread at the present epoch , even in modest - overdensity regions ( see , e.g. , figure 4 in cen & ostriker 1999b ) , so it is interesting that we find a substantial number of cool clouds at @xmath12 , somewhat contrary to theoretical expectations . as noted above",
    ", our data do not preclude the presence of whim gas at @xmath12 , but we find no clear evidence of it .",
    "other sight lines show similar clusters of ly@xmath16 lines , e.g. , the ly@xmath16 complex at @xmath196 0.057 toward pks2155 - 304 ( shull et al .",
    "1998 ; shull , tumlinson , & giroux 2003 ) or the ly@xmath16 lines at @xmath196 0.121 toward h1821 + 643 ( tripp et al .",
    "however , unlike the 0624 ly@xmath16 complex , the pks2155 - 304 and h1821 + 643 examples both show evidence of warm - hot intragroup gas . to test whether the observations and simulations are in accord",
    ", it would be useful to assess the frequency and physical properties of these ly@xmath16 complexes in cosmological simulations for comparison with the observations .",
    "it is also interesting that the two systems for which we have obtained abundance constraints ( at @xmath75 =  and ) both indicate relatively high metallicities , but both of these systems are at least 100 kpc away ( in projection ) from the nearest known galaxy .",
    "this naturally raises a question : how did gas that is so far from a galaxy attain such a high metallicity ?",
    "the gas could have been driven out of a galaxy by a galactic wind ; some wind models predict that the outflowing material will have a high metallicity ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ) , the difficulty with this interpretation is that winds from nearby galaxies are usually observed to contain substantial amounts of hot gas ( e.g. , strickland et al .",
    "2004 ) , which seems to be inconsistent with the absorption line properties as we have discussed .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the high - metallicity gas we have detected in absorption has been tidally stripped out of one of the nearby galaxies .",
    "there are indications that tidal stripping could be a more gentle process for removing gas from galaxies , and a tidally stripped origin can therefore more easily accommodate the observed low - ionisation state of the gas . for example , in the direction of ngc3783 , the galactic high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) at @xmath197 247  is now recognized to be tidally stripped debris from the smc . while this tidally stripped material shows a wide array of low - ionisation absorption lines , it has little or no associated high - ion absorption ( lu et al .",
    "1994 ; sembach et al .",
    "moreover , the tidally - stripped hvc contains molecular hydrogen , which sembach et al .",
    "argue formed in the smc and survived the rigors of tidal stripping ( as opposed to forming in situ in the stream ) .",
    "both the absence of high ions and the survival of h@xmath80 suggest that the stripping process did not substantially ionise and heat this hvc .",
    "several galaxies are close enough to the 0624 sight line to be plausible sources of the gas in a tidal stripping scenario .",
    "one of the nearby galaxies , se1 , has a distorted spiral morphology .",
    "this galaxy is a plausible source of tidally stripped matter .",
    "we have presented a study of absorption - line systems in the direction of 0624 using a combination of high - resolution uv spectra obtained with _ hst_/stis and  plus ground - based imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies within @xmath4430 of the sight line .",
    "in addition to presented the basic measurements and ancillary information , we have reported the following findings :    \\1 .",
    "there are several abell galaxy clusters in the foreground of 0624 , including two clusters at @xmath12 0.077 ( a559 and a564 ) and three at @xmath12 0.110 ( a554 , a562 , and a565 ) .",
    "these clusters trace large - scale dark matter structures , i.e. , superclusters or filaments of the `` cosmic web '' .",
    "our galaxy redshift survey has revealed galaxies at these supercluster redshifts in the immediate vicinity of the 0624 sight line , and therefore our qso spectra provide an opportunity to study the gas in large - scale intergalactic filaments .",
    "the most prominent group of galaxies found in our galaxy redshift survey is at @xmath12  and is not associated with an abell cluster with a spectroscopic redshift from the literature .",
    "however , a557 , for which no spectroscopic redshift has been reported , is at least partly due to the galaxy group at @xmath12 .",
    "the two strongest ly@xmath16 absorption systems at @xmath198 arise in galaxy groups at @xmath199  and .",
    "the ly@xmath16 absorption at  is particularly dramatic : at this redshift , we find 13 ly@xmath16 lines spread over a velocity range of 1000 km s@xmath28 with a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of 265 km s@xmath28 .",
    "the second - strongest system at  is associated with the abell 559/564 large - scale structure , and this indicates that a filament containing gas and galaxies feeds into the abell 559/564 supercluster .",
    "analysis of the ly@xmath16 absorption - line complex at @xmath200 provides strong evidence that the gas is photoionised and relatively cool ; we find no compelling evidence of warm - hot gas in this large - scale filament .",
    "we detect si@xmath4roman3 , si@xmath4roman4 , and c@xmath4roman4 in the strongest component in this ly@xmath16 complex , and photoionisation models indicate that the gas metallicity is high , [ m / h ] = @xmath201 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because we do not find any luminous galaxies close to the sight line ; the closest galaxy is at a projected distance @xmath202 kpc .",
    "the ly@xmath16 system at  is only detected in the c@xmath4roman4 doublet , but nevertheless we find a similar result : the lower limit on the metallicity is relatively high ( [ c / h ] @xmath14 ) while the nearest galaxy is at @xmath203 kpc .",
    "we have compared the distribution of ly@xmath16 doppler parameters and h@xmath4roman1 column densities to high - resolution measurements obtained from other sight lines , and we find good agreement .",
    "we find that the number of broad ly@xmath16 absorbers with @xmath181 40 km s@xmath28 per unit redshift is in agreement with results recently reported by richter et al .",
    "( 2004,2005 ) and sembach et al .",
    "the baryonic content of these broad h@xmath4roman1 lines is still highly uncertain and requires confirmation with higher s / n data , but it is probable that some of these broad line arise in warm - hot gas and contain an important portion of the baryons in the nearby universe .",
    "we also find that the lower bound on @xmath83 vs. @xmath96(h@xmath4roman1 ) is in agreement with predictions from cosmological simulations .",
    "the absence of warm - hot gas in the galaxy group / ly@xmath16 complex at @xmath200  is difficult to reconcile with x - ray observations of bound galaxy groups .",
    "it seems more likely that this in this case we are viewing a large - scale cosmic web filament along its long axis .",
    "the filament contains a mix of early- and late - type galaxies and many cool , photoionised clouds .",
    "the high - metallicity , cool cloud at @xmath13 = 0.06352 is probably tidally stripped material .",
    "this origin can explain the high metallicity and the lack of hot gas .",
    "one of the nearby galaxies has a disturbed morphology consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "similar clusters of ly@xmath16 lines have been observed in other sight lines , and additional examples are likely to be found as we continue to analyse stis data .",
    "we look forward to comparisons of these observations to predictions from cosmological simulations and other theoretical work in order to better understand the processes that affect the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium .",

    "<S> coupled with ground - based imaging and spectroscopic galaxy redshifts , we find evidence that many of these absorbers do not arise in galaxy halos but rather are truly integalactic gas clouds distributed within large - scale structures , and moreover , the gas is cool ( @xmath2 k ) and has relatively high metallicity ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> _ hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) data reveal a dramatic cluster of 13 h@xmath4roman1  lines within a 1000  interval at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find 10 galaxies at this redshift with impact parameters ranging from @xmath6 kpc to 1.37 @xmath7 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the velocities and velocity spread of the  lines in this complex are unlikely to arise in the individual halos of the nearby galaxies ; instead , we attribute the absorption to intragroup medium gas , possibly from a large - scale filament viewed along its long axis . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to theoretical expectations , this gas is not the shock - heated warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) ; the width of the  lines all indicate a gas temperature @xmath8 k , and metal lines detected in the  complex also favor photoionised , cool gas </S>",
    "<S> . no o@xmath4roman6 absorption lines are evident , which is consistent with photoionisation models . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the metallicity is near - solar , [ m / h ] @xmath9 ( @xmath10 uncertainty ) , yet the nearest galaxy which might pollute the igm is at least 135  @xmath7 kpc away . </S>",
    "<S> tidal stripping from nearby galaxies appears to be the most likely origin of this highly enriched , cool gas . </S>",
    "<S> more than six abell galaxy clusters are found within @xmath11 of the sight line suggesting that the qso line of sight passes near a node in the cosmic web . at @xmath12 0.077 , </S>",
    "<S> we find absorption systems as well as galaxies at the redshift of the nearby clusters abell 564 and abell 559 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the sight line pierces a filament of gas and galaxies feeding into these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the absorber at @xmath13 = 0.07573 associated with abell 564/559 also has a high metallicity with [ c / h ] @xmath14 , but again the closest galaxy is relatively far from the sight line ( @xmath15 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the doppler parameters and h@xmath4roman1 column densities of the ly@xmath16 lines observed along the entire sight line are consistent with those measured toward other low@xmath0 qsos , including a number of broad ( @xmath17  )  lines .    intergalactic medium </S>",
