    "key issues include the role of polarized glue and gluon topology in building up the spin of the proton .    the story of the proton s spin dates from the discovery by @xcite that the proton is a fermion of spin @xmath0 .",
    "six years later @xcite measured the proton s anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath1 bohr magnetons , revealing that the proton is not pointlike and has internal structure . the challenge to understand the structure of",
    "the proton had begun !",
    "we now understand the proton as a bound state of three confined valence quarks ( spin 1/2 fermions ) interacting through spin - one gluons , with the gauge group being colour su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the proton is special because of confinement , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the very strong colour gauge fields at large distances .",
    "our present knowledge about the spin structure of the proton at the quark level comes from polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments ( pdis ) which use high - energy polarized electrons or muons to probe the structure of a polarized proton and new experiments in semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering , polarized proton - proton collisions and polarized photoproduction experiments .",
    "the present excitement and global programme in high energy spin physics was inspired by an intriguing discovery in polarized deep inelastic scattering .",
    "following pioneering experiments at slac @xcite , recent experiments in fully inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering @xcite have extended measurements of the nucleon s @xmath2 spin dependent structure function ( the inclusive form - factor measured in these experiments ) over a broad kinematic region where one is sensitive to scattering on the _ valence _ quarks _ plus _ the quark - antiquark _ sea _ fluctuations .",
    "these experiments have been interpreted to imply that quarks and anti - quarks carry just a small fraction of the proton s spin ( between about 15% and 35% )  less than half the prediction of relativistic constituent quark models ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result has inspired vast experimental and theoretical activity to understand the spin structure of the proton . before embarking on a detailed study of the spin structure of the proton it is essential to understand why the small value of this `` quark spin content '' measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering caused such excitement and why it has so much challenged our understanding of the structure of the proton .",
    "we give a brief survey in section i.a .",
    "an outline of the review is given in section i.b .",
    "many elements of subatomic physics and quantum field theory are important in our understanding of the proton spin problem .",
    "these include :    * the dispersion relations for polarized photon - nucleon scattering , * regge theory and the high - energy behaviour of scattering amplitudes , * the renormalization of the operators which enter the light - cone operator product expansion description of high energy polarized deep inelastic scattering , * perturbative qcd : the physics of large transverse momentum plus parton model factorization , * the non - perturbative and non - local topological properties of gluon gauge fields in qcd , * the role of gluon dynamics in dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( the large mass of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons and the absence of a flavour - singlet pseudoscalar goldstone boson in spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to review our present understanding of the proton spin problem and the physics of the new and ongoing programme aimed at resolving the spin - flavour structure of the nucleon .",
    "spin plays an essential role in particle interactions and the fundamental structure of matter , ranging from the subatomic world through to large - scale macroscopic effects in condensed matter physics ( e.g. bose - einstein condensates , superfluidity , and exotic phases of low temperature @xmath6he ) and the structure of dense stars .",

    "the proton s spin vector @xmath12 is measured through the forward matrix element of the axial - vector current @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the proton field operator and @xmath10 is the proton mass .",

    "( here @xmath16 denotes the quark field operator . )",
    "the flavour dependent axial charges @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be written as linear combinations of the isovector , su(3 ) octet and flavour - singlet axial charges @xmath20 in semi - classical quark models @xmath21 is interpreted as the amount of spin carried by quarks and antiquarks of flavour @xmath16 .    in polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments",
    "one measures the nucleon s @xmath2 spin structure function as a function of the bjorken variable @xmath22 , the fraction of the proton s momentum which carried by quark , antiquark and gluon partons in incoherent photon - parton scattering with the proton boosted to an infinite momentum frame .",
    "from the first moment of @xmath2 , these experiments have been interpreted to imply a small value for the flavour - singlet axial - charge : @xmath23 when combined with the octet axial charge measured in hyperon beta - decays ( @xmath24 ) it corresponds to a negative strange - quark polarization @xmath25  that is , polarized in the opposite direction to the spin of the proton .",

    "@xmath16 the gauge invariantly renormalized axial - vector current satisfies the anomalous divergence equation @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the quark mass and",
    "@xmath32 is the topological charge density .",
    "the anomaly is important in the flavour - singlet channel and intrinsic to @xmath33 .",
    "it cancels in the non - singlet axial - vector currents which define @xmath26 and @xmath34 . in the qcd parton model",
    "the anomaly corresponds to physics at the maximum transverse momentum squared @xcite .",
    "the anomaly contribution also involves non - local structure associated with gluon field topology ",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . in dynamical axial u(1 )",
    "symmetry breaking the anomaly and gluon topology are associated with the large masses of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "_ what values should we expect for the @xmath21 ?",
    "_ first , consider the static quark model .",
    "the simple su(6 ) proton wavefunction @xmath35 yields the values @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in relativistic quark models one has to take into account the four - component dirac spinor @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a normalization factor . the lower component of the dirac spinor is p - wave with intrinsic spin primarily pointing in the opposite direction to spin of the nucleon .",
    "relativistic effects renormalize the axial charges obtained from su(6 ) by the factor @xmath40 with a net transfer of angular momentum from intrinsic spin to orbital angular momentum  see e.g. @xcite .",
    "relativistic constituent quark models ( which do not include gluonic effects associated with the axial anomaly ) generally predict values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "for example , consider the mit bag model .",
    "there , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bag radius .",
    "this relativistic factor reduces @xmath26 from @xmath45 to 1.09 and @xmath33 to 0.65 .",
    "centre of mass motion then increases the axial charges by about 20% bringing @xmath26 close to its physical value 1.26 .",
    "pion cloud effects are also important . in the su(2 ) cloudy bag model one finds renormalization factors equal to 0.94 for the isovector axial charge and 0.8 for the isosinglet axial charges @xcite corresponding to a shift of total angular momentum from intrinsic spin into orbital angular momentum .",
    "the resultant predictions are @xmath41 ( in agreement with experiment ) and @xmath46 .",
    "( note that , at this level , relativistic quark - pion coupling models contain no explicit strange quark or gluon degrees of freedom with the gluonic degrees of freedom understood to be integrated out into the scalar confinement potential . )",
    "the model prediction @xmath47 agrees with the value extracted from hyperon beta - decays [ @xmath24 @xcite ] whereas the bag model prediction for @xmath33 exceeds the measured value of @xmath48 by a factor of 2 - 4 .",
    "the overall picture of the spin structure of the proton that has emerged from a combination of experiment and theoretical qcd studies can be summarized in the following key observations :    1 .   constituent quark model predictions work remarkably well for the isovector part of the nucleon s @xmath2 spin structure function @xmath49 : both for the first moment @xmath50 which is predicted by the bjorken sum rule @xcite and also over the whole presently measured range of bjorken @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this includes the slac `` small @xmath22 '' region ( @xmath51 )  see section ix.b below ",
    "where one would , a priori , not necessarily expect quark model results to apply .",
    "constituent quark model physics seems to be important in the spin structure of the proton probed at deep inelastic @xmath52 !",
    "furthermore , one finds the puzzling result that in the presently measured kinematics where accurate data exist the isovector part of @xmath2 considerably exceeds the isoscalar part of @xmath2 at small bjorken @xmath22  the opposite to what is observed in unpolarized deep inelastic scattering .",
    "2 .   in the singlet channel the first moment of the @xmath2 spin structure function for polarized photon - gluon fusion",
    "@xmath53 receives a negative contribution @xmath54 from @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the quark transverse momentum relative to the photon gluon direction and @xmath52 is the virtuality of the hard photon @xcite .",
    "it also receives a positive contribution ( proportional to the mass squared of the struck quark or antiquark ) from low values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the virtuality of the parent gluon and @xmath31 is the mass of the struck quark . the contact interaction ( @xmath59 ) between the polarized photon and the gluon",
    "is flavour - independent .",
    "it is associated with the qcd axial anomaly and measures the spin of the target gluon .",
    "the mass dependent contribution is absorbed into the quark wavefunction of the nucleon .",
    "gluon topology is associated with gluonic boundary conditions in the qcd vacuum and has the potential to induce a topological contribution to @xmath33 associated with bjorken @xmath22 equal to zero : topological @xmath60 polarization or , essentially , a spin `` polarized condensate '' inside a nucleon @xcite .",
    "this topology term is associated with a potential @xmath61 fixed pole in the real part of the spin dependent part of the forward compton amplitude and , if finite , is manifest as a `` subtraction at infinity '' in the dispersion relation for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is associated with dynamical axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking in the transition from constituent quarks to current quarks in qcd .",
    "summarising these observations , qcd theoretical analysis leads to the formula @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the amount of spin carried by polarized gluon partons in the polarized proton and @xmath64 measures the spin carried by quarks and antiquarks carrying `` soft '' transverse momentum @xmath57 where @xmath65 is a typical gluon virtuality and @xmath31 is the light quark mass @xcite ; @xmath66 denotes the potential non - perturbative gluon topological contribution which has support only at bjorken @xmath22 equal to zero @xcite so that it can not be directly measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering .    since @xmath67 under qcd evolution , the polarized gluon term @xmath68 $ ] in eq.([eqa10 ] ) scales as @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the polarized gluon contribution corresponds to two - quark - jet events carrying large transverse momentum @xmath59 in the final state from photon - gluon fusion @xcite .",
    "the topological term @xmath66 may be identified with a leading twist `` subtraction at infinity '' in the dispersion relation for @xmath2 , whence @xmath48 is identified with @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "it probes the role of gluon topology in dynamical axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking in the transition from current to constituent quarks in low energy qcd .",
    "the deep inelastic measurement of @xmath33 , eq.([eqa1 ] ) , is not necessarily inconsistent with the constituent quark model prediction 0.6 _ if _ a substantial fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is associated with gluon topology in the transition from constituent to current quarks ( measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering ) .    a direct measurement of the strange - quark axial - charge , independent of the analysis of polarized deep inelastic scattering data and any possible `` subtraction at infinity '' correction ,",
    "could be made using neutrino proton elastic scattering through the axial coupling of the @xmath71 gauge boson .",
    "comparing the values of @xmath19 extracted from high - energy polarized deep inelastic scattering and low - energy @xmath72 elastic scattering will provide vital information about the qcd structure of the proton .",
    "the vital role of quark transverse momentum in the formula ( [ eqa10 ] ) means that it is essential to ensure that the theory and experimental acceptance are correctly matched when extracting information from semi - inclusive measurements aimed at disentangling the individual valence , sea and gluonic contributions .",
    "for example , recent semi - inclusive measurements @xcite using a forward detector and limited acceptance at large transverse momentum ( @xmath59 ) exhibit no evidence for the large negative polarized strangeness polarization extracted from inclusive data and may , perhaps , be more comparable with @xmath64 than the inclusive measurement ( [ eqa2 ] ) which has the polarized gluon contribution included . further semi - inclusive measurements with increased luminosity and a 4@xmath73 detector would be valuable . on the theoretical side , when assessing models which attempt to explain the proton s spin structure it is important to look at the transverse momentum dependence of the proposed dynamics plus the model predictions for the shape of the spin structure functions as a function of bjorken @xmath22 in addition to the first moment and the nucleon s axial charges @xmath26 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "new dedicated experiments are planned or underway to map out the spin - flavour structure of the proton and , especially , to measure the amount of spin carried by the valence and sea quarks and by polarized gluons in the polarized proton .",
    "these include semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering ( compass at cern and hermes at desy ) , polarized proton - proton collisions at the world s first polarized proton - proton collider rhic @xcite , and future polarized electron - proton collider studies @xcite .",
    "experiments at jefferson laboratory are mapping out the spin distribution of quarks carrying a large fraction of the proton s momentum ( bjorken @xmath22 ) and promise to yield exciting new information on confinement related dynamics .",
    "further interesting information about the structure of the proton will come from the study of `` transversity '' spin distributions @xcite .",
    "working in an infinite momentum frame , these observables measure the distribution of spin polarized transverse to the momentum of the proton in a transversely polarized proton .",
    "since rotations and euclidean boosts commute and a series of boosts can convert a longitudinally polarized nucleon into a transversely polarized nucleon at infinite momentum , it follows that the difference between the transversity and helicity distributions reflects the relativistic character of quark motion in the nucleon .",
    "furthermore , the transversity spin distribution of the nucleon is charge - parity odd ( @xmath74 ) and therefore valence like ( gluons decouple from its qcd evolution equation in contrast to the evolution equation for flavour - singlet quark distribution appearing in @xmath2 ) making a comparison of the different spin dependent distributions most interesting .",
    "studies of transversity sensitive observables in lepton nucleon and polarized proton proton scattering are being performed by the hermes @xcite , compass and rhic @xcite experiments .",
    "one would also like to measure the parton orbital angular momentum contributions to the proton s spin .",
    "exclusive measurements of deeply virtual compton scattering and single meson production at large @xmath52 offer a possible route to the quark and gluon angular momentum contributions through the physics and formalism of generalized parton distributions @xcite . a vigorous programme",

    "there is a vigorous global programme in experimental spin physics spanning ( semi-)inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering , photoproduction experiments , exclusive measurements over a broad kinematical region , polarized proton - proton collisions , fragmentation studies in @xmath695 collisions and @xmath72 elastic scattering .    in this review we surveyed the present ( and near future ) experimental situation and the new theoretical understanding that spin experiments have inspired .",
    "new experiments ( planned and underway ) will surely produce more surprises and exciting new challenges for theorists as we continue our quest to understand the internal structure of the proton and qcd confinement related dynamics .    we conclude with a summary of key issues and open problems in qcd spin physics where the next generation of present and future experiments should yield vital information :    * what happens to `` spin '' in the transition from current to constituent quarks through dynamical axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking ? *",
