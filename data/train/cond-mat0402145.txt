    "in the past few years much attention has been drawn to the properties of shot noise in mesoscopic structures @xcite .",
    "so far experimental studies of shot noise have been primarily concentrated on ballistic and diffusive systems @xcite , with only a few exceptions @xcite where shot noise in electron tunnelling or hopping between localised states was investigated .    in short , mesoscopic barriers , where the condition @xmath2 is realised ( @xmath3 is the correlation length which represents the typical distance between the dominant hops in the hopping network @xcite ) ,",
    "we have studied shot noise in hopping .",
    "a suppression of shot noise in this regime was detected in @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fano factor .",
    "we have found that the result depends significantly on the geometry of the sample : the suppression of shot noise for a wide sample ( 2d geometry ) is found to be much stronger than for a narrow ( 1d geometry ) sample for the same sample length @xcite .",
    "we explain this by the reconstruction of the hopping network in 2d @xcite : in a short and wide sample the current is carried by a set of most conductive parallel hopping chains .    with further decreasing the sample length and temperature , resonant tunnelling through a single localised state",
    "is seen . in this situation",
    "the suppression factor @xmath6 has been predicted to be @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 are the leak rates from the state to the left and right contacts . in our study of shot noise in resonant tunnelling",
    "we have observed not only the suppression of noise , but also its significant enhancement @xcite .",
    "we have proved that this effect is caused by the coulomb interaction between two parallel resonant tunnelling channels , when two localised states carry the current in a correlated way .",
    "experimental observation of increased noise in this case is confirmed by theoretical calculations .",
    "the experiment has been carried out on a _",
    "n_-gaas mesfet consisting of a gaas layer of @xmath10 @xmath11 m thickness ( donor concentration @xmath12 @xmath13 ) . on the top of the gaas layer",
    "au gates are deposited with dimensions @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 m , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath16 m , fig.[gvgt]a  ( i ) . by applying a negative gate voltage , @xmath19",
    ", a lateral potential barrier is formed between the ohmic contacts ( source and drain ) .",
    "some gates contain a split of width @xmath20 , 0.4 @xmath16 m with the aim to define a one - dimensional hopping channel .",
    "we have studied the sample with two gates on the same structure ( @xmath14 @xmath16 m and @xmath15 @xmath16 m ) with splits of different width : @xmath20 @xmath11 m ( sample a ) and @xmath21 @xmath11 m ( sample b ) .",
    "the sample with the narrow split shows different behaviour from one cooldown to another : two - dimensional ( referred to as a-2d ) and one - dimensional ( a-1d ) , fig.[gvgt]a .",
    "this difference in @xmath22 for the 1d and 2d configurations of the same sample can be caused by randomly trapped charge near the 1d constriction .",
    "when the 1d channel is blocked by strong fluctuations , electron transport is only possible under the continuous parts of the gate and the sample is effectively 2d . in the 1d configuration electron transport through the split is seen in fig.[gvgt]a ( ii ) as a characteristic bend in the conductance . the second sample ( b )",
    "has a @xmath23 that does not look similar to either of the two curves of sample a.    the resistance of a macroscopic hopping network is determined by the most resistive ( dominant ) hops separated by the distance of about @xmath3 . to determine the characteristic length @xmath3 in the structure at different gate voltages , the @xmath24-dependence of the conductance of sample a in its 2d configuration has been measured , fig.[gvgt]b . in the gate voltage region from @xmath25 to @xmath26 v good agreement with the @xmath24-dependence of variable range hopping ( vrh ) @xmath27 is found at @xmath28 k ( where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the localisation radius ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 at @xmath35 k ranges from 2 to 6 as the negative gate voltage is increased , reflecting the decrease of the density of states as the fermi level goes down .",
    "the correlation length @xmath36 is presented in fig.[gvgt]b ( inset ) .    in order to measure shot noise at @xmath35 k at a fixed @xmath19 different currents",
    "@xmath37 are put through the sample , and voltage fluctuations are measured by two low - noise amplifiers .",
    "the cross - correlated spectrum of the two signals , @xmath38 , is detected by a spectrum analyser  this technique removes uncorrelated noise of the amplifiers and leads .",
    "the shot noise power is determined from the flat part of the excess noise spectrum above 30 khz , where one can neglect the contribution of @xmath39 noise @xcite .    in order to determine the fano factor we used the following fit for excess noise : @xmath40 @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the ohmic conductance .",
    "this expression describes the evolution of noise from thermal noise for @xmath43 into shot noise ( @xmath44 ) with the fano factor @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of the dominant barriers along the chain @xcite .",
    "the fano factor as a function of gate voltage for different structures is shown in fig.[fanovg ] . in the 2d case",
    "the fano factor slowly increases from 0.1 to 0.2 with increasing negative gate voltage . according to the @xmath45 model this change corresponds to a decrease in the number of dominant hops from @xmath47 to 5 .",
    "the value @xmath48 from fig.[gvgt]b ( insert ) is also plotted in fig.[fanovg ] , where in the range @xmath19 from -1.34 to -1.18 v we find agreement between the fano factor and the number of the dominant hops in the vrh network . with depleting the conducting channel the correlation length increases and approaches the length of the sample , while the fano factor shows a saturation around @xmath49 .",
    "the difference between @xmath50 and @xmath6 confirms that electron transport at these gate voltages is dominated by chains of most conductive hops @xcite .",
    "high conductance of these ` optimal ' chains is provided by the close position of localised states in them and the fact that all the barriers between the states are equal .    in sample a-1d the 1d channel is only formed at @xmath51 v , fig.[gvgt]a . in the range of @xmath19 from -1.32 to -1.63 v ,",
    "the fano factor increases from 0.07 to 0.15 which corresponds to the number of dominant hops @xmath52 . with further increasing negative gate voltage ( @xmath53 v ) the fano factor in fig.[fanovg ] rapidly increases to 0.8 as the distribution of the resistances of random hops in the 1d channel is exponentially broad . in this case",
    "a single hop dominates the whole conductance of the 1d channel , and the fano factor is close to 1 .",
    "the conductance of the second sample ( b ) has not shown a clear definition of the 1d channel in fig.[gvgt]a .",
    "for this sample shot noise in the range of @xmath19 from -1.36 v to -1.31 v has shown an increase of the fano factor from 0.6 to 0.8 , fig.[fanovg ] .",
    "this large value compared with @xmath49 expected for 2d hopping implies that , similar to a-1d , hopping in this sample occurs mainly through the 1d split and is dominated by one or two hard hops .",
    "the differences in @xmath22 of samples a-1d , a-2d and b emphasise the importance of the random fluctuation potential in the formation of 1d channels @xcite .",
    "if the random potential of impurities near the split is large , the conducting channel in the split can not be formed ( as in the case of sample a-2d ) .",
    "sample b has a larger width of the split , and in several cooldowns the 1d channel has not been ` blocked ' by the random potential . in the hopping regime ( at @xmath54 v ) shot noise shows that the sample conduction is entirely determined by the split region .",
    "it is interesting to note that for all studied samples , including the one with length 0.2 @xmath16 m , the poisson value of the fano factor , @xmath55 , has never been observed . in fig.[fanovg ] the maximum fano factor fluctuates near @xmath56 .",
    "although similar average values of @xmath6 have been predicted for electron tunnelling through one impurity randomly positioned along the barrier ( @xmath57 @xcite ) and for tunnelling through two impurities ( @xmath58 @xcite ) , this fact deserves further attention .",
    "shot noise in the case of resonant tunnelling through a single impurity has been studied on a 2d sample with gate length 0.2 @xmath16 m and width 20 @xmath16 m .",
    "one can see in fig.[noise1]a that as the temperature is lowered the background conduction due to hopping decreases and the amplitude of the peaks increases , which is a typical feature of resonant tunnelling through an impurity @xcite .",
    "the box in fig.[noise1]b indicates the range of @xmath19 where shot noise has been studied at @xmath59 k and 4.2 k. in fig.[noise1]c ( inset ) an example of the noise spectrum is shown at a gate voltage near the resonant tunnelling peak in fig.[noise1]b .",
    "the power spectral density of shot noise was determined at frequencies above 40 khz where the contribution of @xmath60 noise ( shown in fig.[noise1]c ( inset ) by a solid line with @xmath61 ) can be totally neglected .",
    "fig.[noise1]c shows the dependence of the shot noise power on @xmath62 at two temperatures . at small biases ( @xmath63 mv ) a pronounced peak in noise is observed , with an unexpectedly large fano factor @xmath64 . at large biases ( @xmath65 mv ) , shot noise decreases to a conventional sub - poisson value , @xmath66 .",
    "the figure shows the dependence @xmath67 with different @xmath6 plotted using the phenomenological expression for shot noise for resonant tunnelling through a single impurity ( cf .",
    "eq.(62 ) in @xcite and eq.(11 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath68 .",
    "we have established that this increase of shot noise appears only in a specific range of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it will be shown below that the region @xmath62-@xmath19 with enhanced shot noise corresponds to the resonant current carried by two interacting impurities .",
    "consider two spatially close impurity levels , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , separated in the energy scale by @xmath71 .",
    "if impurity @xmath70 gets charged , the level @xmath69 is shifted upwards by the coulomb energy @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the separation between the impurities , fig.[grey]a ( diagram 1 ) .",
    "thus , depending on the occupation of @xmath70 impurity @xmath69 can be in two states : @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath62 is small enough , state @xmath75 is above the fermi level in the left contact and electrons are transferred via @xmath74 with the rates @xmath76 only when @xmath70 is empty , fig.[grey]a ( diagram 2 ) .",
    "it can be shown that for such correlated transport via two impurities , a significant increase of noise can be seen if the leak rates of the two impurities are very different . for illustration ,",
    "let us assume that , independent of the occupancy of @xmath69 , impurity @xmath70 ( modulator ) gets charged with rate @xmath77 and empties with rate @xmath78 . if @xmath79 , the contribution of @xmath70 to the total current through the two impurities is negligible . as a result ,",
    "the current through impurity @xmath69 jumps randomly between two values : zero and @xmath80 , dependent on the occupancy of @xmath70 , fig.[grey]a ( inset ) .",
    "if the bias is further increased , the upper state @xmath75 is shifted down and the modulation of the current via impurity @xmath69 vanishes , fig.[grey]a ( diagram 3 ) . in this modulation regime , the corresponding fano factor can be written as @xmath81 .",
    "the first term describes the conventional ( suppressed ) fano factor for one - impurity resonant tunnelling @xcite , whereas the second term gives an enhancement of @xmath6 .",
    "the latter comes from bunching of current pulses , which can be treated as an increase of the effective charge in the electron transfers .",
    "physically , this situation is similar to the increase of flux - flow noise in superconductors when vortices move in bundles @xcite .",
    "the generalisation of this simple model for any relation between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is based on the master equation formalism @xcite . as a result of these calculations ,",
    "the current through two interacting impurities and the fano factor are obtained as functions of the energy positions of the impurities which are shifted with changing @xmath62 and @xmath19 .",
    "we have shown that the increase of shot noise occurs exactly in the region of @xmath19-@xmath62 where two interacting impurities carry the current in a correlated way .",
    "fig.[grey]a presents the grey scale of the differential conductance versus @xmath19 and @xmath62 .",
    "when a source - drain bias is applied , a single resonant impurity gives rise to two peaks in @xmath84 , which occur when the resonant level aligns with the fermi levels @xmath85 .",
    "on the grey scale they lie on two lines crossing at @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , for impurity @xmath70 the central area between the thin lines of the cross at point @xmath70 in fig.[grey]a corresponds to its level being between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , that is to the situation when its occupancy changes with time . on the left of the central region",
    "the impurity is empty and on the right it is filled .",
    "experimentally , the cross of @xmath70 is not seen as the modulator gives a negligible contribution to the current  it is plotted in accordance with the analysis below . however , at small @xmath62 a cross - like feature is clearly seen near point @xmath75  the exact positions of the maxima of the conductance peaks of this line are indicated by circles . with increasing @xmath62 , a new parallel line @xmath74 appears at @xmath89 v and @xmath90 mv , shifted to the left by @xmath91 mv .",
    "this happens when the line @xmath75 enters the central area of cross @xmath70  the maxima of the conductance peaks of the new line are shown by triangles .",
    "the lines @xmath74 and @xmath75 reflect the two states of impurity @xmath69 shifted due to the coulomb interaction with impurity @xmath70 .",
    "the modulation of the current should then occur in region ( 2 ) of the central area of the cross , fig.[grey]a , which corresponds to diagram ( 2 ) . in region",
    "( 3 ) there is no modulation as both states @xmath74 and @xmath75 can conduct , and in region ( 1 ) there is no current as the low state @xmath74 is still above @xmath92 .",
    "in fig.[grey]b current noise and the fano factor are presented as functions of @xmath62 for different @xmath19 .",
    "it shows that indeed the increase of noise occurs only in region ( 2 ) in fig.[grey]a . for a quantitative analysis",
    "we have to take into account that in our experiment resonant tunnelling via state @xmath69 exists in parallel with the background hopping .",
    "then the total fano factor has to be expressed as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 are the fano factors and currents for resonant tunnelling and hopping , respectively . in order to get information about the background hopping",
    "we have measured the current and noise at @xmath98 v , i.e. away from the resonant tunnelling peak under study in fig.[grey]a .",
    "the numerical results have been fitted to the experimental @xmath99 and @xmath100 , fig.[grey]a , b .",
    "the fitting parameters are the leak rates of @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath101 @xmath16ev , @xmath102 @xmath16ev , and @xmath103 @xmath16ev , @xmath104 @xmath16ev ) , the energy difference between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath105 mev ) , and the fano factor for the background hopping ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this value of the fano factor is expected for shot noise in hopping through @xmath107 potential barriers ( 1 - 2 impurities in series ) @xcite .",
    "the coefficients in the linear relation between the energy levels @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath62 , @xmath19 have also been found to match both the experimental data in fig.[grey]b and the position of lines @xmath74 and @xmath75 in fig.[grey]a . the coulomb shift ( @xmath108 mev ) found from fig.[grey]a agrees with the estimation for the coulomb interaction between two impurities not screened by the metallic gate : @xmath109 mev , where @xmath110  is the distance between the gate and the conducting channel .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hopping background effectively hampers the manifestation of the enhanced fano factor @xmath94 : the largest experimental value of @xmath6 in fig.[grey]b ( at @xmath111 v ) is approximately @xmath112 , while a numerical value for rt at this @xmath19 is @xmath113 .",
    "with further decreasing the temperature down to @xmath114 mk we have seen a significant increase of the fano factor up to @xmath115 , fig.[rt ] .",
    "this regime corresponds to the quantum case @xmath116 where the master equation approach is not applicable .",
    "we can assume that this increase is also related to the interaction between different resonant tunnelling channels , although more theoretical input is required to understand this effect .",
    "there is another interesting feature in fig.[rt ] : the increase of shot noise slows down at the position of the conductance peak , so that the fano factor shows a decrease at the points , where the new current channel is switched on , fig.[rt ] ( insets ) .",
    "the details of hopping transport in 1d and 2d have been investigated by measuring shot noise . it is shown that suppression of shot noise contains information about the geometry of hopping paths and the distribution of hopping barriers in them . in one - impurity",
    "resonant tunnelling we have observed a significant increase of shot noise . it it shown that this increase is caused by the coulomb interaction between two close resonant tunnelling channels . in general , we have demonstrated that shot noise is a valuable tool for investigations of electron transport in the insulating regime of conduction .",
