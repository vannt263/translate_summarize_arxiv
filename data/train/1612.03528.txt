    "this year s workshop featured about fifty experimental talks covering a wide variety of results in meson and baryon decays , heavy flavor and quarkonium production , heavy ion collisions , kaon physics , neutrino physics , and searches for new physics ( np ) .",
    "the presentations were organized as follows : heavy flavor production ( monday ) ; heavy flavor decays ( tuesday ) ; neutrino physics ( wednesday ) ; mixing and  violation ( thursday ) ; spectroscopy ( thursday ) ; and future experiments and facilities ( friday ) . interspersed throughout the week were talks on searches for np and theory talks .",
    "experimental results were presented from atlas , alice , belle , babar , besiii , cdf , cms , lhcb , phenix , and star . in this summary",
    "i discuss only a few highlights from among all these talks . for further details the reader",
    "is referred to the original presentations and these proceedings .",
    "numerous results were presented on the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , charmonium and bottomonium mesons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 vector bosons , and lighter pions and electrons , from lhc and rhic experiments .",
    "the star experiment ( zhang ) presented measurements  @xcite of the correlation function @xmath4 , where the variable @xmath5 is half the relative momentum between two particles produced in a collision , @xmath6 is the distribution for a pair of particles in the same event , and @xmath7 is the distribution for two particles produced in _ different _ events . if there is a net attractive interaction between the particles , @xmath8 increases as @xmath5 decreases ; if there is a net repulsive interaction , @xmath8 decreases as @xmath5 decreases ; and if there is negligible interaction , @xmath8 is independent of @xmath5 and equals unity .",
    "the star data corresponds to au - au collisions at @xmath9  gev and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : star_corr](left ) .",
    "a strong attractive correlation is observed for both @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath11-@xmath11 distributions .",
    "taking their ratio shows an equal attractive force over most of the @xmath5 range .",
    "however , at the lowest @xmath5 values the @xmath10-@xmath10 attractive force appears to be stronger .",
    "more data is needed to confirm this effect .",
    "-0.30 in    to measure a quantitative difference between @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath11-@xmath11 interactions and in this manner test @xmath12 , star fits the @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath11-@xmath11 spectra for @xmath8 using the lednicky and lyuboshitz model  @xcite .",
    "the fit yields two parameters : the effective range of the interaction @xmath13 , and the scattering length @xmath14 .",
    "the latter indicates whether the interaction corresponds to an attractive bound state ( @xmath15 ) , an attractive but unbound state ( @xmath16 ) , or is repulsive ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the fit result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : star_corr](right ) , which shows that @xmath13 and also @xmath14 are the same for @xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath11-@xmath11 interactions , within errors . in both cases the range @xmath13 is approximately 2.5  fm , and @xmath14 corresponds to an attractive unbound state .",
    "the lhcb experiment ( szumlak ) presented measurements of differential cross sections for prompt and secondary @xmath18 production , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 production , and @xmath0 and @xmath22 production .",
    "all cross sections are measured as a function of @xmath23 and rapidity @xmath24 and correspond to @xmath25 collisions at @xmath26  tev . from measurements of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 production ,",
    "lhcb obtains a @xmath30 total production cross section of @xmath31  @xmath32b , where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic , and the last error is due to the @xmath33 fragmentation model . from measurements of non - prompt @xmath18 production ,",
    "i.e. , events in which the @xmath18 candidate forms a secondary ( rather than primary ) vertex , lhcb calculates a @xmath34 total production cross section of @xmath35  @xmath32b .",
    "this value is plotted in fig .",

    "the alice experiment ( de ) presented results for meson production in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the energy density of such collisions corresponds to the environment of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , and partons produced in collisions interact with the qgp when escaping and subsequently lose energy .",
    "this parton energy loss is expected to decrease as the parton mass increases .",
    "the parameter quantifying parton interactions with the qgp is the `` nuclear modification factor : '' @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of nucleons participating in the @xmath49-@xmath49 collision .",
    "the greater the interaction with the qgp and subsequent energy loss , the lower @xmath50 ; this is referred to as `` suppression . '' the amount of suppression is found to increase with @xmath23 .",

    "the highest points correspond to @xmath10-pb collisions and show little suppression ; presumably the incoming proton does not generate a sufficient qgp energy density .",

    "the measurement is challenging for lhcb due to the electrons .",
    "photons reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter that lie close to the candidate electron s trajectory are added to the electron s four - momentum to improve the resolution ; as a consequence , the signal shape for the @xmath95 mass distribution must be treated separately for one , two , or three `` recovered '' photons .",
    "in addition , the background shape depends on whether the event was electron - triggered , kaon - triggered , or passed some other trigger criterion ; thus the different trigger streams are fitted separately .",
    "the result is @xmath96 for @xmath97 , which is @xmath98 below unity .",
    "this measurement has significantly higher precision than similar measurements made by belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite .",
    "the belle experiment ( king ) presented a new result for the ratio @xmath99 @xmath100 that uses `` leptonic tagging , '' i.e. , events in which the opposite - side @xmath1 is required to decay semileptonically , producing an electron or muon .",
    "this requirement significantly reduces backgrounds .",
    "the analysis obtains @xmath101 signal ( @xmath102 ) decays and @xmath103 normalization ( @xmath104 ) decays ; the result is @xmath105 , which , like a previous measurement by belle using a hadronic tagging method  @xcite , and also an lhcb measurement  @xcite ( hamilton ) , is significantly higher than the sm prediction of  0.25  @xcite .",

    "there are eight underlying parameters , among which @xmath116 is the longitudinal polarization of the final state , and @xmath117 is the forward - backward asymmetry of the @xmath113 system .",
