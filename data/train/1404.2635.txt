    "in the double - slit experiment , we can not observe an interference pattern if we also measure which slit the particle went through ( that is , if we obtain perfect _ which - path information _ ) .",
    "in fact , there is a continuous tradeoff between interference ( phase information ) and which - path information : the better we can distinguish the two possible paths , the less visible the interference pattern becomes @xcite .",
    "what is more , for a decrease in interference visibility to occur it suffices that there are degrees of freedom _ somewhere in the world _ that , _ if they were measured _ , would allow us to make , with a certain degree of confidence , a statement about the path of the particle through the slits . while we can not say that prior to their measurement , these degrees of freedom have encoded information about a particular , definitive path of the particle  instead , we have merely _ correlations _ involving both possible paths  no actual measurement is required to bring about the decrease in interference visibility .",
    "it is enough that , _ in principle _",
    ", we could make such a measurement to obtain which - path information .",
    "this is somewhat loose talk , and conceptual caveats lurk .",
    "but it captures quite well the essence of what is happening in decoherence , where those `` degrees of freedom somewhere in the world '' are the degrees of freedom of the system s environment interacting with the system , leading to the creation of quantum correlations ( entanglement ) between system and environment .",
    "decoherence can thus be thought of as a process arising from the _ continuous monitoring of the system by the environment _ ; effectively , the environment is performing nondemolition measurements on the system ( see sec .",

    "consider again the double - slit experiment and denote the quantum states of the particle ( call it @xmath0 , for `` system '' ) corresponding to passage through slit 1 and 2 by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "suppose that the particle interacts with another system @xmath3for example , a detector or an environment  such that if the quantum state of the particle before the interaction is @xmath1 , then the quantum state of @xmath3 will become @xmath4 ( and similarly for @xmath2 ) , resulting in the final composite states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "for an initial superposition state @xmath7 , the final composite state will be entangled , @xmath8 the statistics of all possible local measurements on @xmath0 are exhaustively encoded in the reduced density matrix @xmath9 , @xmath10 for example , suppose we measure particle s position by letting the particle impinge on a distant detection screen .",
    "statistically , the resulting particle probability density @xmath11 will be given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the last term represents the interference contribution .",
    "thus , the visibility of the interference pattern is quantified by the overlap @xmath14 , i.e. , by the distinguishability of @xmath4 and @xmath15 . in the limiting case of perfect distinguishability , @xmath16 , no interference pattern will be observable and we obtain the classical prediction .",
    "phase relations have become _ locally _",
    "( i.e. , with respect to @xmath0 ) inaccessible , and there is no measurement on @xmath0 that can reveal coherence between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the coherence is now between the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , requiring an appropriate _ global _ measurement ( acting jointly on @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) for it to be revealed .",
    "conversely , if the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath3 is such that @xmath3 is completely unable to resolve the path of the particle , then @xmath4 and @xmath15 are indistinguishable and full coherence is retained at the level of @xmath0 , as is also directly obvious from eq .  .",

    "equation   shows that the reduction in visibility increases as @xmath4 and @xmath15 become more distinguishable .",
    "here is another way of putting the matter .",
    "looking back at eq .  , we see that @xmath3 encodes which - way information about @xmath0 in the same `` relative - state '' sense @xcite in which epr correlations @xcite may be said to encode `` information . ''",
    "that is , if @xmath16 and we were to measure @xmath3 and found it to be in state @xmath4 , we could , in epr s words @xcite , `` predict with certainty '' that we will find @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",

    "nor does it mean that the result of a subsequent path measurement on @xmath0 is necessarily determined , by virtue of the measurement on @xmath3 , prior to this @xmath0-measurement s actually being carried out .",
    "after all , as peres has cautioned us @xcite , unperformed measurements have no outcomes .",
    "so while the picture of @xmath3 as `` encoding which - path information '' about @xmath0 is certainly suggestive and helpful , it should be used with an understanding of its conceptual pitfalls .",

    "consequently , an interference experiment carried out on @xmath0 would find reduced visibility , representing diminished local coherence between the components @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    as hinted above",

    "then an idealized account of the decoherence interaction has form @xmath22 we have here introduced a time parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 corresponds to the onset of the environmental interaction , with @xmath25 for all @xmath26 ; at @xmath27 the system and environment are assumed to be uncorrelated ( an assumption common to most decoherence models ) .",
    "a single environmental particle interacting with the system will typically only insufficiently resolve the components @xmath28 in the system s superposition state .",
    "but because of the large number of such particles ( and , hence , degrees of freedom ) , the overlap between their different joint states @xmath29 will rapidly decrease as a result of the build - up of many interaction events . specifically , in many decoherence models an exponential decay of overlap is found @xcite , @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the characteristic decoherence timescale , which can be evaluated for particular choices of the parameters in each model ( see sec .

    "recall , further , that the situation we encounter in decoherence is precisely one in which we do not actually read out the environment  or , in the present picture , in which we do not inquire about the result of the indirect measurement .",
    "this suggests that decoherence can indeed be understood as an indirect measurement  a monitoring  of the system by its environment .",
    "decoherence can occur in any basis ; which observable is monitored by the environment depends on the specific form of the system  environment interaction .",

    "collisional decoherence can also be dominant in microscopic systems when these systems occur in distinct spatial configurations that couple strongly to the surrounding medium .",

    "@xcite computes the time dependence of the amount of decoherence introduced into the system for a large set of initial states of the system evolving under the total system  environment hamiltonian .",

    "the states most immune to decoherence will be those which lead to the smallest decrease in purity or the smallest increase in von neumann entropy .",
    "application of this method leads to a ranking of the possible preferred states with respect to their robustness to the interaction with the environment .",
    "for particular models it has been explicitly shown that the states picked out by the predictability sieve are robust to the particular choice of the measure of decoherence .",
    "for example , in the model for quantum brownian motion , different measures lead to the same minimum - uncertainty wave packets in phase space @xcite .",

    "a necessary condition for such a symmetry to obtain is the absence of terms in @xmath64 that act jointly on system and environment in a nontrivial manner .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath85 in the dfs can then be written as @xmath86 and will evolve according to @xmath87 thus , the state @xmath85 does not become entangled with the environment and is therefore immune to decoherence . when the self - hamiltonian @xmath88 of the system can not be neglected , one needs to additionally ensure that none of the basis states @xmath28 of the dfs will drift out of the subspace under the evolution generated by @xmath88 .",

    ", we see an object not by directly interacting with it , but by intercepting scattered photons that encode information about the object s spatial structure @xcite .    in this sense , quantum darwinism provides a dynamical explanation for the robustness of states of ( especially ) macroscopic objects to observation .",
    "it was found that the observable of the system that can be imprinted most completely and redundantly in many distinct fragments of the environment coincides with the pointer observable selected by the system  environment interaction @xcite ; conversely , most other states do not seem to be redundantly storable . indeed , it has been shown that the redundant proliferation of information regarding pointer states is as inevitable as decoherence itself @xcite .",

    "decoherence is a consequence of environmental entanglement . in the literature on quantum computing , however , the term `` decoherence '' is often used to refer to _ any _ process that affects the qubits , including perturbations due to _ classical _ fluctuations and imperfections .",
    "examples for sources of such classical noise in the context of quantum computing are the fluctuations in the intensity @xcite and duration @xcite of the laser beam incident on qubits in an ion trap , inhomogeneities in the magnetic fields in nmr quantum computing @xcite , and bias fluctuations in superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "the distinction between classical noise and quantum decoherence has been further blurred in quantum error correction , since the error - correcting schemes are insensitive to the physical origin of the qubit errors ( see sec .  [",

    "phenomenologically and formally the influence of classical noise processes may be described in a manner similar to the effect of environmental entanglement , namely , in terms of a decay of the off - diagonal elements ( interference terms ) in the local density matrix ( in the environment - superselected basis ) .",
    "but in the case of noise , the decay of the off - diagonal elements occurs because the system s density matrix is identified with an average over a physical ensemble of systems ( or , put differently , over the different instances of particular noise processes ) , while in the case of decoherence the decay is due to an entanglement - induced delocalization of phase coherence for individual systems .",
    "the fundamental difference between these physical processes is masked by the density - matrix description .",
    "indeed , one can always find an experimental procedure that would , at least in principle , distinguish between the different physical processes underlying formally similar density - matrix descriptions .",
    "in contrast with decoherence , noise does not create system  environment entanglement and can in principle always be undone using only local operations ( witness , for example , the reversal of ensemble dephasing in nmr experiments using the spin - echo technique ) . in any individual realization of the noise process the dynamics of the system are completely unitary , and thus no coherence is lost from the system . by contrast , if the system becomes entangled with environmental degrees of freedom , at the very least we would need to perform a pair of measurements on the environment before and after the interaction with the system in order to gather enough information to reverse the effect of decoherence by application of an appropriate countertransformation .",

    "quantum computation and quantum information processing rely on coherent superpositions of mesoscopically or macroscopically distinct states that are highly susceptible to decoherence .",
    "avoiding , controlling , and mitigating decoherence is therefore of paramount importance .",
    "while the qubits need to be protected from detrimental environmental interactions , we also need to be able to control and measure them via a macroscopic apparatus .",
    "the formidable challenge of designing a quantum computer consists of meeting both demands in a balanced way .",
    "even so , decoherence induced by interactions with the environment and the control apparatus , as well as noise due to faulty gate operations , will likely be too strong to allow for useful quantum computations to be carried out @xcite .",
    "what is also needed is an active mitigation of the effects of decoherence through active quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "we may distinguish two limiting cases for modeling decoherence in qubits .",
    "the first limit is that of _ independent qubit decoherence_. here , each qubit couples independently to its own environment , without any interactions between these environments .",
    "for example , this may be the case if the qubits are spatially well - separated ( relative to the typical coherence length of the environment ) and only couple to their immediate surroundings .",
    "then the error processes affecting the qubits will be completely uncorrelated . thus",
    ", if the probability of a particular error to affect one qubit is @xmath252 , the probability of this error to occur in @xmath253 qubits will be @xmath254 .",
    "many error - correcting schemes are only efficient in correcting such single - qubit errors , and thus the assumption of independent decoherence frequently underlies these schemes .",
    "this assumption , however , is unrealistic when the qubits are located spatially close to each other . in this case , all qubits approximately feel the same environment , and it is likely that errors will become correlated among multiple qubits .",
    "the limiting case corresponding to this situation is that of _ collective qubit decoherence _ , in which all qubits couple to exactly the same environment .",
    "consider a single qubit @xmath0 , initially described by a pure state @xmath85 and interacting with an environment @xmath3 .",
    "one can show that an arbitrary evolution of the combined qubit  environment state can always be written in the form @xmath255 where the pauli operators @xmath256 act on the hilbert space of @xmath0 , and @xmath257 and @xmath258 are environmental states that are not necessarily orthogonal or normalized .",
    "thus , any influence of the environment on the qubit can be expressed simply in terms of a weighted sum of the pauli operators and the identity operator acting on the original state of the qubit .",
    "the effects of @xmath259 and @xmath242 on the qubit state are often referred as a _ bit - flip error _ and _ phase - flip error _ , respectively .",

    ". equation represents a worst - case scenario . in many cases ,",
    "simplified versions can be used .",
    "one important case is that of _ partial decoherence_. here , only a small number @xmath263 of qubits become entangled with the environment between two successive applications of an error - correcting mechanism",

    ", we only need to consider a collection of independent phase - flip errors acting on single qubits , represented by error operators of the form @xmath266 .",
    "given the entangled state on the right - hand side of eq .  , the goal of quantum error correction is to restore the initial ( unknown ) state @xmath85 .",
    "we let an ancilla , described by an initial state @xmath267 , interact with the qubit system such that @xmath268 \\ , \\longrightarrow \\ ,     \\sum_{i } { \\left\\vert{a_i}\\right\\rangle } \\left ( e_i { \\left\\vert{\\psi}\\right\\rangle } \\right )    { \\left\\vert{e_i}\\right\\rangle}.\\ ] ] let us assume that the ancilla states @xmath269 are at least approximately mutually orthogonal , such that they can be distinguished by measurement .",

    "gives @xmath276 note that , as required in order to avoid introducing additional decoherence in the computational basis of the qubit system , we have obtained no information whatsoever about the state of the system .",
    "this account of quantum error correction has been highly idealized .",
    "let us mention three complications .",
    "first , it is impossible to design an interaction between the computational qubits and the ancilla that would allow us to distinguish , by measuring the ancilla , between _ all _ possible errors .",
    "second , in realistic settings the error operators @xmath262 may be very complex , and it remains to be seen whether and how the corresponding countertransformations can be applied without introducing significant additional decoherence .",
    "third , the ancilla qubits are physically similar to the computational qubits and can therefore be expected to be equally prone to environmental interactions ( and thus decoherence ) as the computational qubits themselves .",
    "since the inclusion of ancilla qubits increases the total number of qubits in the quantum computer , and since decoherence rates typically scale exponentially with the size of the system , it will require sophisticated experimental designs to ensure not only that quantum error correction works in practice , but also that it does not aggravate the problem of qubit decoherence .",
    "we introduced the concept of decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) @xcite , or pointer subspaces @xcite , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dfs ] .",
    "dfs allow us to encode quantum information in `` quiet corners '' of the hilbert space to protect it from environmental effects .",
    "in contrast with quantum error correction , dfs prevent errors from happening in the first place and thus represent a strategy for intrinsic error avoidance .",
    "the two limiting cases of independent qubit decoherence and collective qubit decoherence delineate the limits on the size of a dfs . to illustrate this relationship ,",
    "let us consider the case of collective decoherence of an @xmath260-qubit system interacting with an oscillator bath @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for this generalized spin  boson model is taken to be [ compare eq .  ]",

    "there are @xmath283 different possible integer eigenvalues @xmath164 , ranging from @xmath284 ( corresponding to the basis state @xmath285 ) to @xmath286 ( corresponding to @xmath287 ) .",
    "the largest number of mutually orthogonal computational - basis states with the same eigenvalue @xmath164 of @xmath280 is given by the set @xmath288 of basis states with @xmath289 , i.e. , those with @xmath290 qubits in the state @xmath230 .",
    "there are @xmath291 such states in this set , spanning a dfs of dimension @xmath292 . for large values of @xmath260",
    ", we can approximate the binomial coefficient using stirling s formula , @xmath293 therefore , in the limiting case of collective decoherence , the dimension of our dfs approaches the dimension of the original hilbert space , and the encoding efficiency approaches unity . for example",
    ", for @xmath294 qubits , the set @xmath295 spans a maximum - size dfs of dimension six , to be compared with the dimension of the original hilbert space , which is @xmath296 .",
    "thus , given the model for collective decoherence considered here , using four physical qubits we can encode up to two logical qubits in a dfs ( since encoding three logical qubits would already require a dfs of dimension @xmath297 ) .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : dfs ] , the existence of a dfs corresponds to a dynamical symmetry .",
    "our model represents a case of perfect dynamical symmetry , since the system  environment interaction , eq .",
    ", is completely symmetric with respect to any permutations of the qubits , thereby leading to a dfs of maximum size . what happens if the symmetry is broken by additional small independent coupling terms ?",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , to first order in the perturbation strength , the _ storage _ of quantum information in dfs is stable to such perturbations to all orders in time , but that the _ processing _ of such quantum information encoded in dfs is robust only to first order in time .    in the case of purely independent qubit decoherence",
    ", the environment operators @xmath262 appearing in eq .   will now differ from one another . to find a dfs , we follow the usual strategy",
    "[ see eq .",
    "] of determining a set of orthonormal basis states @xmath79 such that @xmath298 { \\left\\vert{s_i}\\right\\rangle}\\\\ = \\lambda^{(j ) } { \\left\\vert{s_i}\\right\\rangle } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for all @xmath26 and @xmath299 .",
    "the only state fulfilling this eigenvalue problem is @xmath287 .",
    "since we need at least a two - dimensional subspace to encode a single logical qubit , the case of independent decoherence in the spin  boson model does not allow for the existence of a dfs for quantum computation . in the language of pointer subspaces",
    ", there is only a single exact pointer state , and this environment - superselected preferred state of the system will be the ground state @xmath287 .    in realistic settings , neither the assumption of purely independent decoherence nor the limit of entirely collective decoherence will be entirely appropriate .",
    "we can , however , use a dfs to protect the qubits from collective decoherence effects , and we can recover from single - qubit errors due to independent decoherence using active error - correction methods .",
    "these two approaches can be _ concatenated _ @xcite to enable universal fault - tolerant quantum computation even when the restriction to single - qubit errors is dropped @xcite .      for reasonably large dfs to exist ,",
    "the system  environment interaction must exhibit a sufficiently high degree of symmetry .",
    "such symmetries are unlikely to arise naturally in typical experimental settings .    one way of overcoming this limitation is based on _",
    "environment engineering_. here , one tries to generate certain symmetries in the structure of the system  environment interactions .",
    "for example , an appropriately engineered symmetrization could make superposition states in bose ",
    "einstein condensates correspond to ( approximate ) degenerate eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian , in which case such states would lie within a dfs , thereby significantly enhancing their longevity @xcite . in ion traps , changing the parameters in the effective interaction hamiltonian for the trapped ion allows one to select different pointer subspaces and thereby control into which dfs the trapped ion is driven @xcite .",
    "another approach to the active creation of dfs is known as _ dynamical decoupling _ @xcite . here",
    "time - dependent modifications are introduced into the hamiltonian of the system that counteract the influence of the environment .",
    "these modifications take the form of sequences of rapid projective measurements or strong control - field pulses acting on the system ( `` quantum bang - bang control '' @xcite ) . even if the structure of the system  environment interaction hamiltonian is not known , decoherence can be suppressed arbitrarily well in the limit of an infinitely fast rate of the decoupling control field , thus dynamically creating a dfs ( which then represents a dynamically decoupled subspace ) . in the realistic case of a finite control rate , sufficient ( albeit imperfect ) protection from decoherence",
    "can be achieved via this decoupling technique , provided the control rate is larger than the fastest timescale set by the rate of formation of environmental entanglement .",
    "decoherence , of course , happens all around us , and in this sense its consequences are readily observed . but what we would like to do is to be able to experimentally study the _ gradual _ and _ controlled _ action of decoherence . in this endeavor ,",
    "several obstacles have to be overcome .",
    "we need to prepare the system in a superposition of mesoscopically or even macroscopically distinguishable states with a sufficiently long decoherence time such that the gradual action of decoherence can be resolved . we must be able to monitor decoherence without introducing a significant amount of additional , unwanted decoherence .",
    "we would also like to have sufficient control over the environment so we can tune the strength and form of its interaction with the system .",

    "they allow us to test and improve decoherence models , and they help us design devices for quantum information processing that are good at evading the detrimental influence of the environment .",
    "finally , such experiments may be used to test quantum mechanics itself @xcite .",
