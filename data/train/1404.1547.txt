    "deploying more cellular base stations ( bs ) has been the main remedy to cope with relentless traffic growth . to reach the highest capacities ,",
    "interest has lately been turning toward ultra - dense bs deployment @xcite , @xcite , where the density of bs may even exceed the typical number of users in a given area .",
    "the impact of such extreme bs densification , however , has still not been explicitly analyzed .    to be more specific , in an engineering perspective , the preceding work @xcite provides an analytic average spectral efficiency ( se ) calculation that reveals the se is independent of bs density .",
    "the result is accurate only when bs density is low as it relies on an assumption that every bs has at least a single serving user . for densely deployed bs environment ,",
    "the authors @xcite consider turned - off bss when having no serving users as in the third generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) release 12 specifications @xcite , and predict the se is a logarithmic function of bs density via its compatible performance metrics , service capacity , outage probability , and common ( worst user s ) rate respectively .",
    "nevertheless , they can not represent the explicit relationship between the se and bs density due to the intractable forms of results .",
    "motivated by these discussions on the bs densification , we derive an analytic se expression valid for general bs density by utilizing a stochastic geometric approach @xcite , and further provide its closed - form representation under ultra - dense bs environment .",
    "the result verifies _ se logarithmically increases with bs density _ in ultra - dense networks where the bs densification makes interference restricted by turning off empty bss .    in an economic perspective",
    ", the authors @xcite consider a network operator s profit maximization based on user demand prediction in a single cell scenario neglecting the bs densification effect .",
    "for a multi - cell network , the work @xcite deals with cost minimization when bs density is low . regarding the relationship between user demand and network supply , the authors @xcite provide an analytic approach although it resorts to an iterated simulation .",
    "this study , leading from the preceding works , focuses on the question : how much amount of bs density and spectrum a network operator should invest in when user demand changes ? to capture the user demand variation , we consider two user demand characteristics : ( i ) user density and ( ii ) each user s sensitivity to his downloading rate .",
    "we thereby answer the question via solving a profit maximization problem while considering the user demand meeting network s rate supply .",

    "it implies , in other words , bs densification does not yield any gain in se under sparse environment since its desired signal power improvement is on the same order of amount as the aggregate interference increase , cancelled out each other at calculating @xmath15 .",
    "for an ultra - dense ( @xmath24 ) network when @xmath25 by using taylor expansion , the equation hardly captures the relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath1 due to the complicated double integrations therein .",
    "we take a detour this problem by deriving the closed - form approximation of @xmath12 in the following proposition .",
    "interestingly , this simple expression shows that @xmath12 is a logarithmic function of @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "_ bs densification does increase the se whilst yielding diminishing returns _ under ultra - dense environment .",
    "a stochastic geometric point of view interprets this phenomenon as follows . at a typical user ,",
    "increasing @xmath1 shrinks each bs s coverage , simultaneously yielding : ( i ) the shortened distance to his associated bs and ( ii ) increased the number of empty cells ( or turned - off bss ) .",
    "focusing firstly on the former , the shortened distance in the order @xmath26 ( see the average distance is @xmath27 in @xcite ) yields the received signal power increase from the associated bs , in the order @xmath28 . for the latter in an ultra - dense scenario , it makes almost all bss turned - off except for the ones serving users in their infinitesimal coverage regions .",
    "consequently , the interfering bs locations ( or interferer density ) converge to the users ( or @xmath3 ) , delimiting the quantity of interference .",
    "combining these results leads to the ever - increasing @xmath15 in the order @xmath29 , resulting in the logarithmic se increase .",

    "additionally , it is worth mentioning that this result shows the bs ultra - densification gain in se . comparing to @xmath22 in a sparse scenario ,",
    "ultra - densification provides the se gain : 162% , 250% , and 464% for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 respectively when @xmath7 .",
    "now we turn our attention to multiple access of users with a fixed amount of spectrum .",
    "so far we have considered a bs serves all users in its coverage .",
    "instead , we henceforth consider each bs serves at most a single user at a given time , who is selected according to a uniformly random scheduler @xcite .",
    "according to proposition 2 in @xcite , a typical user s selection probability by the scheduler for a sparse network is @xmath34 , and for an ultra - dense network is @xmath11 . applying these results to the equations and yields the following corollary .",

    "that is because multiple access of users barely occurs in the ultra dense network where almost all bss have at most a single user within their coverages .",
    "this results in being equivalent to .",
    "the following section utilizes these results so as to explore the economic impact of bs densification .",
    "in this section , our objective is to maximize a network operator s profit when user demand varies , caused by the changes in the number of users @xmath3 and/or each user s rate sensitivity @xmath36 .",
    "the operator is able to cope with these demand changes by adjusting his operating bs density @xmath1 and spectrum amount @xmath37 as well as price per nats / sec ( or per nat for unity time ) @xmath38 . since the profit is a joint function of user demand , price , average rate , and its operating cost , the operator s profit maximizing decision problem to clarify the adjustments in @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is not trivial , being of our interest . to be more specific ,",

    "( optimal bs density and spectrum amount )    we interpret the above results in the following perspectives : 1 ) unit operating costs @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the resultant profit optimal operating costs @xmath58 and @xmath59 and 2 ) user demand comprising per - user rate sensitivity @xmath36 and user density @xmath3 .      increasing unit bs operating cost @xmath41 leads to investing more in spectrum as the bs substitute , captured by increasing @xmath54 , and vice versa for unit spectrum operating cost @xmath42 increase .    multiplying these unit operating costs by and yields the following profit optimal operating bs / spectrum cost ratio .    _ _ ( optimal cost ratio ) _ profit maximizing ratio of bs and spectrum operating costs in a sparse or ultra - dense downlink cellular network is given as : @xmath60 _    in a sparse network , the operator should invest in bs operating cost as much as the spectrum cost since bs density and spectrum amount equally affect average rate ( see with the spectrum amount @xmath37 , shown in ` ( p3 ) ` ) . in an ultra - dense network , on the other hand , bs density less affects average rate than spectrum amount due to the densification s logarithmic impact on average rate .",
    "this leads to the investment strategy that bs operating cost should be less than the spectrum cost , depending on @xmath30 ( note @xmath61 ) .",
    "the straight lines on the bs density - and - spectrum planes ( bottom ) in fig .",
    "3 illustrate such operating cost ratios .      both profit optimal bs density and spectrum amount increase as user demand grows , but the optimal value increments incurred by user density are higher than the values by per - user rate sensitivity ( see the exponents of @xmath3 and b in and , visualized in fig .",
    "while rate sensitivity growth solely increases user demand , user density growth not only increases the demand but also decreases average rate due to : ( i ) incurring more multiple access congestion in a sparse network or ( ii ) generating more interference in an ultra - dense network ( see the discussion after proposition 1 in section [ sect : cap_approx ] ) .",
    "consequently , increasing user density requires more bs density and/or spectrum amount in order to keep up with the demand growth as well as to recover the average rate decline .    such different impacts of user density and per - user rate sensitivity furthermore affect the network profitability .",
    "for user density growth , fig .",
    "4(a ) shows the profit of an ultra - dense network increases less than that of a sparse network .",
    "an ultra - dense network requires much more bs density and spectrum amount to compensate the interference generation caused by user density growth , and it engenders too much cost increase worsening the network profitability . for this type user demand increase ,",
    "bs ultra - densification is not preferable .    for per - user rate sensitivity growth , in contrast , fig .",
    "4(b ) depicts the profit of an ultra - dense network increases more than that of a sparse network thanks to the network s delimited interference , promoting ultra - dense bs deployment .",
    "in this paper we have derived a closed - form relationship between bs density and se in an ultra - dense cellular network .",
    "the se is shown to be a logarithmic function of bs density as the density grows .",
    "this closed - form se expression was used to derive closed - form solutions for the optimal operating bs density and spectrum amount , for the traditional spectrum licensing ( auction ) case .",
    "this expression could aid the operator in his decision if he should invest more in bs densification or bid for more spectrum for his network .",
    "our results reveal some fundamentally unique characteristics of the ultra - dense network deployment , e.g. that the number of users has a larger impact on the optimal network configuration than each user s sensitivity to his downloading rate .",
    "further , in our simplified model we see that the network operator should maintain a reasonable balance in investment , allocating about equal amounts to spectrum and bs deployment .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first to simultaneously specify not only random spatial locations of both users and bss but also each user s demand model , bridging the gap between stochastic geometric and network economic analysis .",
    "a weakness of the study is the very simple , homogeneous propagation model , i.e. using a constant path loss exponent .",
    "the bss are typically in the same room as the users in line - of - sight ( los ) conditions , whereas the interfering bss are behind walls , i.e. in non - los conditions , creating a better sir .",
    "further work should therefore involve a two - slope model , describing the los and non - los cases and giving a more direct relationship to the physical environment .",
    "further extension to this work could also include milimeter - wave systems where non - los signals are very weak .",
