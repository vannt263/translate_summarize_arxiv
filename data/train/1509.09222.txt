    "the inherent openness of the wireless medium makes it susceptible to both intentional and un - intentional interference .",
    "interference from the neighboring cells is one of the major causes of un - intentional interference . on the flip side , intentional interference , such as jamming attacks , corresponds to adversarial attacks on a victim receiver . in this paper",
    ", we study jamming attacks against wireless networks .",
    "jamming - related studies not only provide insights into offensive attack strategies , but also enable us to understand the vulnerabilities of existing systems . most studies that are related to jamming attacks in the physical layer only consider the presence of a single node ( source - destination pair ) and develop optimal jamming strategies , see @xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
    "having gained insights about the jamming behavior in a single communication link scenario , the next step is to understand the jamming behavior against networks .",
    "jamming against wireless multi - hop networks has previously been addressed from an optimization perspective in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xcite-@xcite consider the problem of jammer placement against wireless multi - hop networks with the aim of stopping the flows in the network .",
    "the jammer - to - flow assignment problem i.e. , optimally assigning jammers to stop flows in the network based on their locations and other constraints such as power , was considered in @xcite .",
    "all these works model networks as a graph and study the jamming problem with an aim to find the best set of nodes / edges to attack so that the network is disconnected .",
    "while these studies indicate which nodes / links to be attacked , they do not address the problem of jamming attacks against wireless networks from a physical layer perspective and do nt consider infrastructure networks such as cellular or wifi .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we address the problem of attacking a wireless network when the jammers are randomly deployed in a given area and how this attack can be realized at the physical layer .",
    "since the victim receiver location is typically unknown _ a priori _ , the jammers are randomly deployed in a given area .",
    "specifically , in this paper we consider a wireless network comprising of bs or aps that are deployed in an area of interest and investigate the impact of a fixed number of jamming nodes that are randomly deployed in the same area .",
    "the network performance under the jamming attack is analyzed from the perspective of the downlink of a victim receiver that is accessing this wireless network .",
    "since the number of jammer nodes is fixed , we model the jammer network using a binomial point process ( bpp ) @xcite .",
    "notice that such an analysis is practical and useful as it will help in understanding the number of jamming nodes that would be needed to disrupt a wireless network , for example to attack an enemy network in a military setting .",
    "using the proposed jammer network model , we analyze the jamming performance against the wireless network in terms of a ) the outage probability and b ) the error probability of a victim receiver in this wireless network .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for both these metrics and analyze in detail the jamming impact against the wireless network in the presence of shadowing and fading typically seen in wireless environments .",
    "as will be shown , accounting for log - normal shadowing in both the outage and error probability analysis is complicated .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we use the gaussian - hermite quadrature approximation @xcite to account for this log - normal shadowing and give simple analytical expressions for both these metrics . we also show how this approximation affects the theoretical outage and error probabilities by comparing them with numerical simulations .    using the closed form outage - probability expressions ,",
    "we discuss in detail how the jammer network parameters must change according to the wireless network so as to maximize outages at the victim receiver .",
    "while the outage probability characterizes the overall network performance in terms of the interference experienced at the victim receiver , it typically ignores the signaling schemes used by the bs / aps to communicate with the victim receiver .",
    "for instance , irrespective of the modulation schemes employed by the various nodes in the network , the outage probability analysis uses the power levels of the various signals in order to evaluate the signal - to - interference and noise ratio at the victim receiver .",
    "hence , the outage probability analysis alone does not cover all the aspects of jamming a wireless network .",
    "therefore , in this paper we also study the jamming performance in terms of the symbol error probability of the victim receiver which explicitly takes into consideration the signaling schemes used by the bs / ap and also the jammers .",
    "the error probability of the victim receiver can be analyzed by using tools from stochastic geometry when random spatial distributions are considered @xcite .",
    "however , there is relatively limited work in the literature ( related to non - jamming scenarios ) that performs such an analysis ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite , @xcite , a novel approach termed as _ equivalent - in - distribution _ is developed to estimate the error probability of the victim receiver in the presence of interference generated from a poisson field which is modeled as an alpha - stable distribution .",
    "however , no such equivalent distributions or approximations are known for the cases in which the interference arises from a binomial field @xcite , which is the model considered for the jammers in this paper . in @xcite , a nearest neighbor approximation ( corresponding to the modulation scheme of the victim )",
    "is used to analyze the error probability in a non - jamming scenario . in this method ,",
    "the error probability depends on the minimum distance of the modulation scheme and the number of nearest neighbors for the points in the modulation scheme .",
    "since no equivalent distributions or approximations are known for the interference originating from a binomial field , in this paper we follow the approach in @xcite to analyze the error probability of the victim receiver .",
    "the various parameters that impact the victim receiver performance include the shadowing variance , transmit power of the bss , the bs density , the network loading , i.e. , the density of simultaneously active bss , the jammer signal power , and the number of jammers .",
    "the effect of each of these parameters on the jamming impact at the victim receiver is examined both analytically and numerically . for instance , we show that in order to maintain a constant outage probability at the victim receiver , the number of jammers a ) increases with the victim signal power levels , b ) decreases with increasing network load , and c ) decreases with increased shadowing levels . the jamming impact against the wireless network",
    "is also addressed when retransmissions are employed .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the jammer network obeys an interesting concave - type behavior as a function of the bs / ap density in order to maintain a constant outage probability at the victim receiver .",
    "similar analysis of the jammer network impact is performed in the context of the error probability of the victim receiver .",
    "in addition to the above analysis , we discuss the impact of some recent findings related to jamming in a point - to - point link scenario , when analyzing jamming against wireless networks . while extending",
    "the analysis in @xcite to the case of networks is beyond the scope of this paper , we discuss in detail the behavior of various jamming signals using extensive simulations .",
    "we consider a victim wireless network of bss or aps that are modeled according to a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath3 of density @xmath4 on @xmath5 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the downlink analysis in this paper is performed at the victim receiver which is assumed to be at the origin .",

    "along similar lines , we define the reference jammer - to - noise ratio as @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that the shadowing is constant over the time of interest and hence the serving bs is selected based on the average received signal strength . in other words , shadowing impacts the bs selection but fading does not . under such conditions , the displacement theorem @xcite , @xcite states that the overall effect of shadowing can be taken into consideration as a perturbation in the locations of the bss ( recall that the bss are distributed according to a ppp ) if @xmath49 .",
