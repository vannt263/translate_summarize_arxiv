    "quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information processing .",
    "it is efficiently used as a key resource in several communication protocols for sending quantum as well as classical information from a sender to a receiver .",
    "dense coding ( @xcite , @xcite ) is one such exhibitions of entanglement in quantum communication .",
    "quantum dense coding ( qdc ) deals with efficient information transfer from a sender to a receiver utilizing an entangled channel between the two . moreover , qdc is the process of transmitting two - bits of classical information by sending only one qubit if the sender and the receiver share a maximally entangled state . in this respect ,",
    "hao et.al gave one protocol of controlled dense coding @xcite where they considered ghz - states @xcite and showed that the three qubits of ghz state was shared by three parties alice ( the sender ) , bob ( the receiver ) and third party charlie is the controller of the scheme . in @xcite ,",
    "al studied controlled dense coding with four particle non maximally entangled state .",
    "there they showed that the transmission of bits from party-@xmath4 to party-@xmath0 is controlled by party-@xmath5 and party-@xmath6 s local measurements as well .",
    "our goal is to realize the controlled dense coding scheme in a tripartite maximally entangled state in higher dimension . with this motivation , in this paper",
    ", we mainly emphasize on controlled dense coding with ghz states , since these states can be generated in the laboratory and have been demonstrated experimentally using two pairs of entangled photons @xcite and also one can make optimal distillation of these states @xcite .",
    "we therefore we have used different forms of ghz -class states , like ghz -type , quadripartite ghz states and ghz states as a special case of maximal slice states @xcite . in due process",
    ", we also have studied controlled dense coding on states of w - class @xcite .",
    "w - class of states are important from various aspects .",
    "three particle w state @xmath7 can be generated using super conducting phase qubits @xcite.the three particle ghz and w states are fully characterized using quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "also four particle w states have been considered here for the study of controlled dense coding .",
    "these quadripartite w states can also be generated by parametric down conversion method @xcite .",
    "study of controlled dense coding is then made upon tripartite qutrit state of ghz form in this paper .",
    "such qutrit states are generated via adiabatic passage of dark states @xcite .",
    "the paper is therefore organized as follows .",
    "+ in section @xmath8 we have given an overview of controlled dense coding scheme with various classifications of ghz states . in section @xmath9",
    "we made a study with ghz type states .",
    "since we know that ghz type states are not useful for perfect dense coding and for these states probabilistic dense coding was studied by @xcite , hence study of controlled dense coding was made with ghz type states in a probabilistic manner .",
    "section @xmath10 deals with maximal slice states whereas four particle ghz states were studied with respect to controlled dense coding in section @xmath11 . in sections @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 we used controlled dense coding with w - class of states . finally in section",

    "it is found that , the average number bits transmitted from sender to receiver depends on the basis of measurements chosen by the controller of the scheme .",
    "it has been shown that ghz - type states like @xmath182 , where @xmath183 can be used in controlled dense coding scheme in a probabilistic sense .",
    "we have also found that for these ghz type states , charlie ( the controller of the scheme ) chooses parameter @xmath50 by manipulating his measurement angle @xmath2 .",
    "consequently we have found a relation between @xmath50 and @xmath2 .",
    "also a relation between concurrence of the bipartite state shared by alice - bob with respect to the state @xmath182 and measurement angle @xmath2 of charlie have been established .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath73 , the controlled dense coding scheme is achieved successfully with success probability @xmath5 .",
    "controlled dense coding is also achieved with maximal slice state only if the parameters @xmath184 are chosen in an appropriate way . for proper chioces of @xmath184 ,",
    "the maximal sliced states basically takes the ghz form .",
    "next four particle ghz - state is also taken into consideration and the relation between concurrence of the shared bipartite state by alice - bob and parameters @xmath185 is established .",
    "the study of controlled dense coding is made with w - class states . by considering the bipartite state shared by alice - bob for the w - class of states and by calculating the concurrence of these states",
    ", we have explained that states like @xmath186 and @xmath187 can not be used in controlled dense coding .",
    "it is because , the maximum value of concurrence for the shared bipartite states with respect to @xmath186 and @xmath187 are @xmath188 and @xmath126 respectively and never reaches its maximal value @xmath5 .",
    "but it is interesting to see that the state @xmath189 can be used successfully in controlled dense coding in a probabilistic manner for parameter values @xmath142 and @xmath52 .",
    "finally , we have successfully performed the controlled dense coding scheme on tripartite qutrit state of ghz form , by introducing two @xmath160 unitary braid matrices to send @xmath4 classical bits of information from alice to bob controlled by third party charlie .",
    "so we can infer that the tripartite qutrit state of ghz form is an optimal state that achieve the desired task . in future",
    "it would be quite interesting to make a quantitative study of this above scheme with ghz states in arbitrary dimension and for maximally and non - maximally entangled mixed states which is very important from quantum information theoretic perspective .",
