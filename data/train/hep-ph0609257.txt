    "numerous theoretical and phenomenological motivations exist for a minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) . at the same time one of the attractive by - products of low energy supersymmetry",
    "is the natural occurrence in the particle content of the theory of a stable weakly interacting massive particle , the lightest neutralino , which could be the microscopic constituent of the as yet unobserved galactic halo dark matter .",
    "another strong motivation comes from the sm hierarchy problem , originating from the large fine - tuning required by the stability of the electroweak scale to radiative corrections , originating from the large number of orders of magnitude occurring between the gut , or the planck , scale , and the electroweak scale itself .",
    "although very appealing , the mssm has been challenged by various pieces of experimental information , and by some arguments of more theoretical nature . among these , the lep - ii limit on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs  @xcite , the constraints on the masses of supersymmetric ( ) charged or colored particles from direct searches at lep and at the tevatron @xcite , and the so - called @xmath0 problem , _ i.e. _ the fundamental reason why the  higgsino mass term @xmath0 appearing in the mssm superpotential lies at some scale near the electroweak scale rather than at some much higher scale .",
    "the addition of a new gauge singlet chiral multiplet , @xmath1 , to the particle content of the mssm can provide an elegant solution to the mentioned @xmath0 problem of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the so - called next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite is an example of one such minimal extension that also alleviates the _ little fine tuning problem _ of the , arising from the non - detection of a neutral cp - even higgs at lep - ii  @xcite .",
    "a further motivation to go beyond the mssm comes from electro - weak baryogenesis ( ewb ) , _ i.e. _ the possibility that the baryon asymmetry of the universe originated through electro - weak physics at the electro - weak phase - transition in the early universe .",
    "although still a viable scenario within the mssm @xcite , ewb generically requires the higgs mass to be in the narrow mass range above the current lep - ii limits and below @xmath2 gev , a rather unnatural mass splitting between the right - handed and the left - handed stops ( the first one required to lie below the top quark mass , and the other in the multi - tev range ) , cp violation at levels sometimes at odds with electric dipole moment experimental results , and , generically , a very heavy sfermion sector @xcite . in contrast , the nmssm provides extra triscalar higgs couplings which hugely facilitate the occurrence of a more strongly first - order ew phase transition , and extra cp violating sources , relaxing most of the above mentioned requirements in the context of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "one of the chief remaining cosmological issues associated with the nmssm , the cosmological domain wall problem  @xcite , caused by the discrete @xmath3 symmetry of the , can be circumvented by introducing non - renormalizable planck - suppressed operators  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the  contains three cp - even and two cp - odd scalars , which are mixtures of -like higgses and singlets .",
    "also , the neutralino sector contains five mass - eigenstates , instead of the four in the , each of which has , in addition to the four  components , a singlino component , the latter being the fermionic partner of the extra singlet scalars .",
    "the extended higgs and neutralino sectors weaken the mass bounds for both the higgs bosons and the neutralinos .",
    "very light neutralinos and higgs bosons , even in the few gev range , are in fact not excluded in the  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ; the particle spectrum with the dominant 1-loop and 2-loop corrections to the higgs sector is available via the numerical code  @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmology of dark matter singlinos has been addressed long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the lsp relic abundance in the  was first calculated in  @xcite .",
    "constraints from electroweak symmetry breaking and gut scale universality were added in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the computer code  @xcite , has been extended to allow for the relic density calculation in the  @xcite .",
    "the implications for the direct detection of  neutralinos were first studied in  @xcite , where light neutralinos ( @xmath4 3 gev ) with acceptable relic abundance and sufficiently large expected event rates for direct detection with a @xmath5ge - detector were found in different domains of the parameter space , when the gaugino unification relation  @xcite was relaxed . in  @xcite , the theoretical predictions for the spin - independent neutralino - proton cross section , @xmath6 , were reevaluated , and all available experimental constraints from lep on the parameter space were taken into account .",
    "values within reach of present dark matter detectors were obtained in regions with very light higgses , @xmath7 , with a significant singlet contribution .",
    "the lightest neutralino , in those regions , features a large singlino - higgsino composition , and a a mass in the range @xmath8 .",
    "more recently , neutralinos as light as @xmath9 , satisfying accelerator constraints and with the right relic density , have been shown to occur in  @xcite , where it was argued that the  can , moreover , provide neutralinos in the mass range that would be required to reconcile the dama claim of discovery with the limits placed by cdms .",
    "so far , theoretical studies have not addressed the possibility that  neutralinos making up the galactic dark matter can manifest themselves _",
    "indirectly_. for instance , pair annihilations of neutralinos in the galactic halo can produce sizable amounts of antimatter , which current and forthcoming space - based antimatter search experiments can possibly detect ; neutralinos trapped in the sun or in the earth  @xcite can give rise to a coherent flux of energetic neutrinos from the center of the sun or of the earth ; pair annihilation of neutralinos , either in nearby large - dark - matter - density sites , or from the cumulative effect of annihilations outside the galaxy , can produce gamma - ray fluxes at a level detectable by glast or by ground - based air cherenkov telescopes ; and last , but not least , the exciting possibility of peculiar gamma - ray spectral features , like a sharp monochromatic peak at @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 indicates the lightest neutralino , assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ) , from loop - induced @xmath12 processes , can also be , in principle , very promising .",
    "a first motivation for looking into indirect dark matter detection within the  comes from the possibility that thermally produced neutralinos , in this context , can be _ very light_. since the pair annihilation rate of thermal relics is roughly fixed by requiring that the thermal neutralino abundance coincides with the cold dark matter abundance inferred by astrophysical observations @xcite , the indirect detection rates generically scale as @xmath13 : light neutralinos are therefore expected to give significantly enhanced rates with respect to the standard case .",
    "a more technical point has provided us with a second motivation to look into indirect detection prospects for  neutralinos : loop induced pair annihilations of neutralinos into two photons or two gluons ( respectively contributing to the mentioned monochromatic gamma - ray line and to , _",
    "e.g. _ , antimatter fluxes ) are predicted to be increased , within the , by the presence of extra diagrams mediated by the ( potentially light ) extra cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "we therefore extend here , for the first time , the mssm results for these loop - induced neutralino pair - annihilation amplitudes @xcite to the nmssm .",
    "our results suggest several signatures , including muons resulting from neutralino annihilation in the earth , and antiparticle and gamma ray production from neutralino annihilation in the galaxy , where the nmssm produces signals that are enhanced compared to those predicted in the mssm .",

    "<S> we explore the prospects for indirect detection of neutralino dark matter in supersymmetric models with an extended higgs sector ( nmssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute , for the first time , one - loop amplitudes for nmssm neutralino pair annihilation into two photons and two gluons , and point out that extra diagrams ( with respect to the mssm ) , featuring a potentially light cp - odd higgs boson exchange , can strongly enhance these radiative modes . </S>",
    "<S> expected signals in neutrino telescopes due to the annihilation of relic neutralinos in the sun and in the earth are evaluated , as well as the prospects of detection of a neutralino annihilation signal in space - based gamma - ray , antiproton and positron search experiments , and at low - energy antideuteron searches . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the low mass regime the signals from capture in the earth are enhanced compared to the mssm , and that nmssm neutralinos have a remote possibility of affecting solar dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> also , antimatter experiments are an excellent probe of galactic nmssm dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also find enhanced two photon decay modes that make the possibility of the detection of a monochromatic gamma - ray line within the nmssm more promising than in the mssm . </S>"
