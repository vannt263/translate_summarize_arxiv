    "the great success of wireless industry is driving the proposal of new services and innovative applications , such as internet of things ( iot ) and mobile cyber - physical applications , which yield an exponential growth of wireless traffic with billions of connected devices . to handle the enormous mobile data traffic , network densification and heterogeneity supported by various radio access technologies ( e.g. ,",
    "massive mimo @xcite and millimeter - wave communications @xcite ) have become an irreversible trend in 5 g wireless networks @xcite .",
    "however , this will have a profound impact and bring formidable challenges to the design of 5 g wireless communication systems in terms of energy efficiency , capital expenditure ( capex ) , operating expenditure ( opex ) , and interference management @xcite .",
    "in particular , the energy consumption will become prohibitively high in such dense wireless networks in the era of mobile data deluge .",
    "therefore , to accommodate the upcoming diversified and high - volume data services in a cost - effective and energy - efficient way , a paradigm shift is required in the design of 5 g wireless networks .    by leveraging the cloud computing technology @xcite ,",
    "the cloud radio access network ( cloud - ran ) @xcite is a disruptive technology to address the key challenges of energy efficiency in 5 g wireless networks .",
    "specifically , by moving the baseband units ( bbus ) into a single bbu pool ( i.e. , a cloud data center ) with shared computation resources , scalable and parallel signal processing , coordinated resource allocation and cooperative interference management algorithms @xcite can be enabled among a large number of radio access points , thereby significantly improving the energy efficiency @xcite and spectral efficiency @xcite . as the conventional compact base stations are replaced by low - cost and low - power remote radio heads ( rrhs ) , which are connected to the bbu pool through high - capacity and low - latency fronthaul links ,",
    "cloud - ran provides a cost - effective and energy - efficient way to densify the radio access networks @xcite .",
    "while cloud - ran has a great potential to reduce the energy consumption of each rrh , with additional fronthaul link components and dense deployment of rrhs , new challenges arise for designing green cloud - ran . in particular , instead of only minimizing the total",
    "transmit power consumption via coordinated beamforming @xcite , the network power consumption consisting of the fronthaul link power consumption and the rrh power consumption should be adopted as the performance metric for designing green cloud - ran @xcite . to minimize the network power consumption ,",
    "a group sparse beamforming framework was proposed in @xcite to adaptively select the active rrhs and the corresponding fronthaul links via controlling the group sparsity structures of the beamforming vectors .",
    "such an idea of exploiting sparsity structures in the solutions has also demonstrated its effectiveness in solving other mixed combinatorial optimization problems in cloud - ran , e.g. , the data assignment problem @xcite and the joint uplink and downlink network power minimization problem @xcite .",
    "although network adaption by selecting the active rrhs provides a promising way to minimize the network power consumption , it is critical to maximize the user capacity ( i.e. , the number of admitted users ) when the network power minimization problem is infeasible @xcite .",
    "this infeasibility issue may often occur in the scenarios with a large number of mobile devices requesting high data rates or some users with unfavorable channel conditions .",
    "furthermore , exploiting the benefits of integrating diversified unicast and multicast services @xcite has been well recognized as a promising way to improve the energy efficiency and user capacity , and thus multicast beamforming should be incorporated in cloud - ran . from the system design perspective , to design a green cloud - ran with multicast transmission , a holistic approach is needed to enable network adaptation for rrh selection and user admission in a unified way .",
    "unfortunately , such design problems fall into the category of highly complicated mixed combinatorial optimization problems . the key observation to address this challenge",
    "is that the network power minimization and user admission control can be achieved by adaptively selecting the active rrhs and admitting the mobile users ( mus ) via controlling the sparsity structures in the corresponding solutions .",
    "specifically , for the network power minimization problem , selecting active rrhs is equivalent to controlling the group sparsity structure in the aggregative multicast beamforming vector @xcite .",
    "that is , all the beamforming coefficients of a particular rrh that is switched off need to be set to zeros simultaneously . for the user admission control problem that is needed when the network power minimization problem is infeasible , maximizing the number of admitted users is equivalent to minimizing the number of violated qos constraints @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this is the same as minimizing the sparsity of the auxiliary vector indicating the violations of the qos constraints .",
    "based on these observations , we will thus formulate both design problems as sparse optimization problems based on the @xmath0-norm minimization in a unified framework , based on which efficient algorithms will be developed .",
    "based on the above discussions , we propose a sparse optimization framework to design a multicast green cloud - ran as shown in fig .",
    "[ framework ] , thereby enabling adaptive rrh selection and user admission .",
    "however , in contrast to the previous works on the multicast beamforming problem @xcite with convex objectives but nonconvex qos constraints and the group sparse beamforming problem @xcite with convex qos constraints but nonconvex objective functions in unicast cloud - ran , to design efficient algorithms for the resulting sparse optimization problems in multicast cloud - ran , we need to address the following coupled challenges in a unified way :    * nonconvex quadratic qos constraints due to multicast transmission ; * combinatorial objective functions for rrh selection and user admission .    in particular ,",
    "we summarize the major contributions as follows :    1 .",
    "a sparse optimization framework based on the @xmath0-norm minimization is proposed to design a multicast green cloud - ran by adaptive rrh selection and user admission via controlling the sparsity structures of the solutions .",
    "2 .   to address the combinatorial challenges in the objective functions",
    ", we propose a nonconvex but smoothed @xmath2-minimization approach to induce the sparsity structures in the solutions .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it helps develop the group sparse inducing penalty with quadratic forms in the multicast beamforming vectors .",
    "therefore , the objective function in the resulting group sparse inducing optimization problem is compatible with the nonconvex quadratic qos constraints .",
    "the sdr technique can then be adopted to solve the resulting nonconvex quadratic group sparse inducing optimization problem .",
    "3 .   to address the challenges of",
    "the nonconvex smoothed objective functions and the nonconvex quadratic qos constraints , we propose an iterative reweighted-@xmath4 algorithm to solve the resulting nonconvex smoothed @xmath2-minimization problems based on the principle of the mm algorithm and the sdr technique .",
    "this algorithm is proven to converge to a kkt point of the relaxed smoothed @xmath2-minimization problems over the convex constraint set using the sdr technique .",
    "4 .   simulation results will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms to minimize the network power minimization and maximize the user capacity , and their performance gains compared with the existing convex approximation approaches . in particular , the proposed algorithms can achieve near - optimal performance in the simulated settings .",
    "sparse optimization by exploiting sparsity structures of the solutions has been proven to be very powerful to solve various hard optimization problems in machine learning , compressive sensing and high - dimensional statistics @xcite .",
    "this approach has recently received enormous attentions in designing wireless networks , i.e. , the group sparse beamforming approach for network adaption @xcite , and data assignment in wireless backhaul networks @xcite . in particular , the convex relaxation approaches , e.g. , the @xmath5-minimization @xcite , the mixed @xmath1-norm @xcite and the mixed @xmath6-norm @xcite , have become popular due to the computational efficiency as well as performance guarantees in some scenarios @xcite .    to further improve the performance ,",
    "there has been a great interest in applying nonconvex approaches in sparse optimization @xcite by enhancing sparsity . in particular",
    ", it is observed that the nonconvex @xmath2-minimization approach performs better than the traditional convex @xmath5-minimization especially when the underlying model is very sparse @xcite .",
    "motivated by this result , we adopt the @xmath2-minimization approach to closely approximate the resulting @xmath0-norm based sparse optimization problems for multicast green cloud - ran . furthermore , to deal with the unique challenges with the coupled nonconvex constraints and combinatorial objectives , thereby enabling efficient algorithm design , we will use a smoothed version of the @xmath2-minimization approach to induce the sparsity structures in the solutions . note that the existing work on the group sparse beamforming @xcite can only handle problems with a combinatorial objective and convex seconder - order cone qos constraints in unicast cloud - ran , and thus can not be directly applied in the setting of multicast cloud - ran with nonconvex qos constraints .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sysmod ] presents the system model and problem formulations .",
    "section [ lpf ] presents an algorithmic framework for network power minimization and user admission control based on the smoothed @xmath2-minimization .",
    "the iterative reweighted-@xmath4 algorithm is developed in section [ em ] .",
    "simulation results will be demonstrated in section [ simres ] .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions are presented in section [ confu ] .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the system model of the multicast cloud - ran .",
    "then , the network power minimization problem is formulated . for the scenario when it is not feasible to serve all the mus , the user admission control problem is formulated .",
    "it will be revealed that both problems are sparse optimization problems , for which unique challenges will be identified .",
    "we consider a multicast cloud - ran with @xmath7 multi - antenna rrhs and @xmath8 single - antenna mus , where the @xmath9-th rrh is equipped with @xmath10 antennas , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cloudran ] .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the sets of all the rrhs and all the mus , respectively .",
    "we assume that the @xmath8 mus form @xmath13 non - overlapping and non - empty multicast groups , which are denoted as @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 as the set of mus in the @xmath18-th multicast group .",
    "let @xmath19 be the set of all the multicast groups .",
    "we consider the downlink transmission , and the centralized signal processing is performed at the bbu pool @xcite .",
    "the propagation channel from the @xmath9-th rrh to the @xmath20-th mu is denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the transmit beamforming vector from the @xmath9-th rrh to mus in multicast group @xmath17 .",
    "then the transmit signal at the @xmath9-th rrh is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the encoded information symbol for the multicast group @xmath18 with @xmath25=1 $ ] .",
    "assume that all the rrhs have their own transmit power constraints , which form the following feasible set of the beamforming vectors @xmath26 s , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the maximum transmit power of the @xmath9-th rrh .",
    "the received signal @xmath29 at mu @xmath20 in the @xmath18-th multicast group is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the additive gaussian noise at mu @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s are mutually independent and all the users apply single user detection .",
    "therefore , the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of mu @xmath20 in multicast group @xmath18 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37^{\\sf{h}}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{n}$ ] as the channel vector consisting of the channel coefficients from all the rrhs to mu @xmath20 , @xmath38^{\\sf{h}}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{n}$ ] is the beamforming vector consisting of the beamforming coefficients from all the rrhs to the @xmath18-th multicast group , and @xmath39_{l=1}^{l}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{mn}$ ] is the aggregative beamforming vector with @xmath40_{m=1}^{m}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{mn_l}$ ] as the beamforming vector consisting of all the beamforming coefficients from the @xmath9-th rrh to all the multicast groups .      with densely deployed rrhs , it is critical to enable energy - efficient transmission via centralized signal processing at the bbu pool",
    ". coordinated beamforming among rrhs will help reduce the transmit power . due to the mobile data traffic variations in temporal and spatial domains",
    ", it is also critical to enable network adaptation to switch off some rrhs and the corresponding fronthaul links to save power @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to consider the network power consumption when designing green cloud - ran , which is defined as the following combinatorial composite function parameterized by the beamforming coefficients @xcite , @xmath41 with the total transmit power consumption , denoted as @xmath42 , and the total relative fronthaul links power consumption , denoted as @xmath43 , given as @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . here",
    ", @xmath46 is an indicator function that takes value zero if @xmath47 ( i.e. , all the beamforming coefficients at the @xmath9-th rrh are zeros , indicating that the corresponding rrh is switched off ) and one otherwise , where @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the support of the vector @xmath51 . in ( [ tp1 ] )",
    ", @xmath52 is the drain inefficiency coefficient of the radio frequency power amplifier with the typical value as @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in ( [ fh1 ] ) is the relative fronthaul link power consumption @xcite , which is the static power saving when both the rrh and the corresponding fronthaul link are switched off . for the passive optical fronthaul network @xcite , @xmath55",
    "is given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 as the power consumptions for the @xmath9-th rrh and the @xmath9-th fronthaul link in the active ( sleep ) mode , respectively .",
    "the typical values are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "_ note that the energy consumption of the optical fronthaul links should depend on the receiving periods and data transmission @xcite , which is a function of the beamforming vectors_. given the target sinr requirements @xmath66 for all the mus , to design a multicast green cloud - ran , we propose to minimize the network power consumption subject to the qos constraints and the rrh transmit power constraints .",
    "specifically , we have the following qos constraints @xmath67 which can be rewritten as the following quadratic constraints @xmath68 for any @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are nonconvex .",
    "therefore , the network power minimization problem can be formulated as@xmath71 which is highly intractable due to the nonconvex combinatorial composite objective and the nonconvex quadratic qos constraints ( [ si ] ) . when there are some rrhs needed to be switched off to minimize the network power consumption , the solution of problem ( [ pm ] ) has the _ group sparsity _ structure @xcite .",
    "that is , all the beamforming coefficients in @xmath72 , which forms a group at the @xmath9-th rrh , are set to be zeros simultaneously if the @xmath9-th rrh needs to be switched off .",
    "therefore , inspired by the fact that the solution of problem ( [ pm ] ) has the group sparsity structure in the aggregative beamforming vector @xmath51 , the weighted mixed @xmath1-norm was proposed in @xcite to relax the combinatorial composite function as the tightest convex surrogate to induce the group sparsity structure in the solution @xmath51 to guide the rrh selection , defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the weight for the beamforming coefficients group @xmath72 at rrh @xmath9 .",
    "to handle the nonconvex qos constraints in ( [ si ] ) , we propose to lift the problem to higher dimensions with variables @xmath75 , which will help to apply the semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) technique .",
    "however , we can not extract the variables @xmath76 s from the non - smooth mixed @xmath1-norm ( [ mn ] ) .",
    "therefore , this convex relaxation approach can not be directly applied to solve the network power minimization problem in multicast cloud - ran . instead ,",
    "to leverage the sdr technique , we need to develop a new group sparsity inducing approach with quadratic forms of the beamforming vectors , which will be presented in section [ lpf ] and form one major contribution of this paper .",
    "with qos constraints for potentially a large number of mus in the serving area , it may happen that the network power minimization problem ( [ pm ] ) is infeasible from time to time .",
    "in such scenarios , the design problem will be to maximize the user capacity ( i.e. , the maximum number of mus that can be supported ) via user admission control @xcite , while serving these mus with the minimum transmit power . while this aspect is ignored in @xcite , it is critical for practical applications .",
    "mathematically , by adding auxiliary variables @xmath77 s to the right - hand side of the corresponding inequalities in ( [ si ] ) , to maximize the number of admitted mus is equivalent to minimize the number of non - zero @xmath77 s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.4 ) .",
    "therefore , the user admission control problem can be formulated as the following sparsity minimization problem , @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the @xmath8-dimensional nonnegative real vector . once the admitted",
    "mus are determined , coordinated beamforming can then be applied to minimize the total transmit power .",
    "the solution @xmath80 $ ] of problem ( [ ua ] ) has the _ individual sparsity _ structure , i.e. , @xmath81 indicates that the @xmath20-th mu can be admitted .",
    "therefore , the sparsity level will be increased if more mus can be admitted .",
    "observing that both the sparse optimization problems ( [ pm ] ) and ( [ ua ] ) possess the same structure with nonconvex quadratic constraints and combinatorial objectives , in this paper , we will propose a unified way to handle them based on a smoothed @xmath2-minimization approach .",
    "in this subsection , we analyze the unique challenges of the network power minimization problem ( [ pm ] ) and the user admission control problem ( [ ua ] ) in the context of multicast cloud - ran .",
    "in particular , the differences from the previous works @xcite will be highlighted .",
    "the physical - layer multicast beamforming problem @xcite yields nonconvex quadratic qos constraints ( [ si ] ) , while only unicast services were considered in @xcite .",
    "the sdr technique @xcite proves to be an effective way to obtain good approximate solutions to these problems by lifting the quadratic constraints into higher dimensions , which will also be adopted in this paper .",
    "although the sdr technique provides an efficient way to convexify the nonconvex quadratic qos constraints in problems ( [ pm ] ) and ( [ ua ] ) , the inherent combinatorial objective functions still make the resulting problems highly intractable .",
    "while the @xmath5-norm can be adopted to relax the @xmath0-norm in problem ( [ ua ] ) after sdr , which is also known as the sum - of - infeasibilities relaxation in optimization theory @xcite , the convex relaxation approach based on the non - smooth mixed @xmath1-norm @xcite can not be applied to problem ( [ pm ] ) , as we can not extract the variables @xmath76 s after sdr .",

    "the algorithmic advantages and performance improvement of the proposed smoothed @xmath2-minimization based framework will be revealed in the sequel .      to promote sparse solutions , instead of applying the convex @xmath5-minimization approach",

    "<S> the cloud radio access network ( cloud - ran ) has recently been proposed as one cost - effective and energy - efficient technique for 5 g wireless networks . by moving the signal processing functionality to a single baseband unit ( bbu ) pool , centralized signal processing and resource allocation </S>",
    "<S> are enabled in cloud - ran , thereby providing the promise of improving the energy efficiency via effective network adaptation and interference management . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a holistic sparse optimization framework to design green cloud - ran by taking into consideration the power consumption of the fronthaul links , multicast services , as well as user admission control . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we first identify the sparsity structures in the solutions of both the network power minimization and user admission control problems , which call for adaptive remote radio head ( rrh ) selection and user admission . </S>",
    "<S> however , finding the optimal sparsity structures turns out to be np - hard , with the coupled challenges of the @xmath0-norm based objective functions and the nonconvex quadratic qos constraints due to multicast beamforming . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous works on convex but non - smooth sparsity inducing approaches , e.g. , the group sparse beamforming algorithm based on the mixed @xmath1-norm relaxation @xcite , we adopt the nonconvex but smoothed @xmath2-minimization ( @xmath3 ) approach to promote sparsity in the multicast setting , thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle of the majorization - minimization ( mm ) algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an iterative reweighted-@xmath4 algorithm is developed , which will converge to a karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) point of the relaxed smoothed @xmath2-minimization problem from the sdr technique . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with extensive simulations for network power minimization and user admission control in multicast cloud - ran .    </S>",
