    "another type of periodic composites are structures composed of materials with different elastic properties ; showing an energy gap in their elastic wave spectrum , such composites are referred to as _ phononic crystals _ @xcite . recently",

    "studies of 2d magnonic crystals have already been reported @xcite with scattering centers in the form of `` infinitely '' long cylinders disposed in square lattice nodes ( cylinder and matrix materials being two different ferromagnetics ) and spin wave spectra showing the anticipated gaps .",
    "further research was focused on magnetic multilayer systems , which can be regarded as 1d magnonic crystals @xcite . in this paper , we present numerically calculated - and , to our best knowledge , not yet reported in the literature - band structures of _ three - dimensional _ magnonic crystals . due to the complexity of the problem , only the simplest model of 3d magnonic crystal",

    "a static magnetic field , @xmath1 , is applied to the composite along the @xmath2 axis , and assumed to be strong enough to saturate the magnetization of both materials . the lattice constant is denoted by @xmath3 ; the filling fraction , @xmath4 , is defined as the volume proportion of material * a * in a unit cell .",
    "ferromagnetics * a * and * b * are characterized by two material parameters : the spontaneous magnetization ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , and the exchange constant ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) ; both these parameters depend on the position vector @xmath9 : @xmath10 the value of function @xmath11 being 1 inside a sphere , and 0 beyond .    in the classical approximation ,",

    "the magnetization vector can be represented as the sum of its static and dynamic components ; the former , @xmath20 , is parallel to the applied field ; the latter , @xmath21 , @xmath22 denoting the precession circular frequency , lies in the plane ( @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 the dynamic dipolar field , @xmath25 , must satisfy the magnetostatic maxwell equations : @xmath26 in magnonic crystals , the position - dependent coefficients in ( [ eq4 ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are periodic functions of the position vector , which allows us to use in the procedure of solving the ll equation ( [ eq3 ] ) the plane wave method , described in detail in our earlier papers @xcite ( dealing with _ two - dimensional _ magnonic crystals ) . following this scheme ,",

    "the cross - section points indicate the @xmath3 and @xmath71 values at which the computed gap fits the experimental one in terms of both width ( @xmath74 ) and position ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "( b ) magnonic bands calculated on the basis of our model across the brillouin zone , the assumed lattice constant and filling fraction values being @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    "the gap center ( @xmath75 ) is found to descend , and the gap itself ( the dark gray region ) to narrow down as the lattice constant increases .",
    "the superimposed rectangle represents the experimental gap reported in @xcite ) .",
    "the _ gap center _ found experimentally corresponds to our results at @xmath78 ; however , the corresponding gap width resulting from our computations is much above the experimental result , which implies the necessity of fitting the filling fraction as well .",
    "[ fig2]b shows the magnonic band structure plotted against the filling fraction @xmath71 ( the lattice constant being fixed at @xmath79 ) .",
    "the gap is found to open at @xmath80 to reach its maximum width at @xmath81 and vanish at @xmath82 , which means that one gap width value corresponds to two different filling fraction values .",
    "note also that the gap center moves up as the filling fraction increases .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 and @xmath71 values corresponding to an energy gap that fits the experimental results will be determined in two steps ( see fig . [",
    "fig3]a ) : first , we shall find the set of @xmath3 and @xmath71 values corresponding to the experimental gap width , @xmath83 ( the solid line in fig [ fig3]a ) ; next , another line ( the dotted one in the figure ) is plotted , corresponding to the gap centered at the experimental value , @xmath73 . the cross section of these two lines indicates the @xmath3 and @xmath71 values at which both @xmath75 and @xmath74 are fitted . as the lines cross at two points : ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) and ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , two solutions are obtained , one corresponding to the droplet radius @xmath86 , the other to @xmath87 .",
    "the former solution proves close beyond expectation to the experimental result reported in @xcite ( fig .",
    "9 ) , where @xmath50 droplet radius is estimated at @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding mean droplet spacing estimated in @xcite is @xmath89 , also quite close to our result , @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the complete set of structural and material parameters characterizing our droplet magnonic model of @xmath50 is : @xmath56 , @xmath58 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath70 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 . the corresponding full spin - wave spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "an energy gap , existing indeed between the first band and the second one , corresponds very well , in terms of both position and width , to that found experimentally @xcite .",
    "this result allows to propose a working hypothesis that low - doped manganites could be regarded as magnonic crystals existing in nature .",
    "obviously , further research is required for verification of this hypothesis ; therefore , in another paper , we are going to investigate the effect of non - spherical droplet shape on the magnonic spectrum , and to consider a real canted antiferromagnetic matrix , rather than the effective ferromagnetic one considered here .",
