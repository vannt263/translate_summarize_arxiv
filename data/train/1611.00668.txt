    "increasing the retention of students in a particular course and their persistence in continuing through their major area of study has always been a big challenge for universities . while postsecondary enrollment has increased ten - fold since the 50 s , the institutional graduation rate remained at a constant 50 percent level for most of the past half century , increasing only about 10% over the past two decades ( see fig .",

    "s the focus of policymakers has moved to the issues of choice , affordability and persistence .",

    "the increase in 4-year graduation rate for hispanics ( @xmath2 ) and blacks ( @xmath3 ) was substantial @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    one way to approach this problem is to examine student academic and social integration using the tools of social network analysis ( sna ) .",
    "the basic premise linking networks to persistence is that students communities and interactions likely influence whether they remain in a particular class / major or in school overall .",
    "network analysis allows us to gain insight into these communities , as well as how they evolve over time .",
    "in particular , sna can be used to identify patterns of interaction that contribute to integration within a classroom and at the university level and provide quantitative measures to evaluate their importance .",
    "it supplies a methodology to assess the structure and quality of interpersonal interactions , both academic and social .",
    "for example , centrality measures can give an insight into students status within the community , while assortativity coefficient can provide information about their tendency to associate with people of similar background , race or gender  a manifestation of homophily .",
    "understanding how embeddedness within the social and academic network affects students persistence and retention is crucial for improving their experiences . while students integration within an institution seems to be essential to student retention , successful implementation of effective practices to prevent losing students is sparse .",
    "developing network methodologies for studying retention and persistence among university students  a nascent research area  is a step in this direction  @xcite .",
    "we address questions of retention and persistence of students at florida international university ( fiu )  a large , hispanic serving institution .",
    "fiu , as is typical for urban universities in major cities , is a commuter school ",
    "only @xmath4 of students live in  college - owned , college - operated or college - affiliate  housing @xcite . among factors that affect student integration into the social and academic environment of the university",
    ", one can distinguish between external ( e.g. , families , neighborhoods , work settings ) and internal ( e.g. , learning groups within a classroom , residence halls ) communities @xcite .",
    "the importance of a classroom as a focal point of interaction is particularly pronounced at commuter schools  @xcite .    in our study",
    ", we analyze how students positions within a social network in an introductory mechanics modeling instruction ( mi - m ) course predicts their persistence in taking a subsequent electricity and magnetism modeling instruction ( mi - em ) course .",
    "we also look at the associations between persistence and centralities at the beginning of the second semester . modeling instruction ( mi ) is a guided - inquiry interactive - engagement method of teaching .",
    "it organizes instruction around building , testing and applying a handful of scientific models that represent the content core of physics . instead of relying on lectures and textbooks , mi emphasizes students construction of conceptual and mathematical models in an interactive learning community .",

    "although research on undergraduate retention was conducted as early as the 1930 s @xcite , it was the publication of spady s sociological model of student dropout in higher education @xcite , followed by vincent tinto s student integration model @xcite , that started the current dialogue on undergraduate retention . in his paper , spady identified factors that play a part in student social integration and can affect their decision to drop out of school as academic potential , normative congruence , grade performance , intellectual development and friendship support .",
    "he then conducted an empirical study that implicated formal academic performance as the predominant factor for student attrition  @xcite .",
    "tinto , on the other hand , suggested that student retention was linked to both formal and informal academic experiences , as well as social integration .",
    "as part of his model , he proposed three principles of effective retention : ( 1 ) institutional commitment to students , ( 2 ) educational commitment and ( 3 ) social and intellectual community . in order to be effective",
    ", student retention programs must ( 1 ) assure that institutional goals always have a direct or indirect relationship to student success and achievement , ( 2 ) commit to the education of all , not just some , of the students and , finally , ( 3 ) help students feel that they are valued and full members of the social and educational communities @xcite .",
    "based on the work of tinto and his followers , increasing students integration is one of prime targets to increase their persistence .",
    "astin went a step further and reframed the relationship of persistence and involvement into one spectrum , saying `` if we conceive of involvement as occurring along a continuum '' from least to most involvement , `` the act of dropping out can be viewed as the ultimate form of noninvolvement  dropping out anchors the involvement continuum at the lowest end '' @xcite .",
    "he identified different forms that involvement may take , such as students place of residence , dedication to academic studies , student - faculty interaction and participation in extracurricular activities ( with special focus on student government , honors programs and athletics ) , and found that each of these forms impacts persistence in its own way .    in the 1990 s and 2000 s ,",
    "persistence research shifted to a more holistic direction and adopted a multifaceted interdepartmental understanding of how to retain students .",
    "this approach invokes a `` cross - departmental institutional responsibility for retention via wide - range programming '' @xcite that brings together the otherwise - disparate parts of an institution , including admissions officers , instructors , the financial aid office , academic services and student affairs . to help students navigate these complex elements of an institution ,",
    "it became clear that universities must offer accessible support services in a combination of academic , personal and social contexts in order to support student persistence @xcite .",
    "nora extended tinto s model to incorporate additional factors , including academic and social integration @xcite , that was then used to investigate stem student persistence at a hispanic serving institution @xcite . in the context of improving graduation rates of underrepresented minorities",
    ", a recent study has found that the `` sense of belonging was positively related to persistence '' for hispanic students in stem majors , implying that `` greater levels of academic and social integration may be related to higher levels of retention '' @xcite",
    ". however , quantitative research on students academic and social integration , as well as practical implementations of these findings , are not very common and `` the really difficult work of shaping institutional practice  has yet to be tackled '' @xcite .",
    "the use of social network analysis , which offers `` a new perspective in which integration is expressed as a function of individual social ties '' from students to their peers and instructors , while also incorporating individual background characteristics discussed above makes quantitative research of integration possible @xcite .",
    "thomas used this approach to study the link between integration and persistence and found a nuanced relationship between students social ties and their gpa , goal commitment and persistence . his work was followed up by several researchers who found connection between social ties and multiple outcomes , including sense of community and academic performance , which we note explicitly appear as distinct elements within tinto s integration model @xcite .",
    "eckles and stradley reported that `` factors such as athletic participation , membership in a fraternity or sorority , religion , and ethnicity  were not individually significant '' and found that a students persistence from year 1 to year 2 was instead influenced by their friends persistence @xcite .",
    "they went on to argue `` those variables have been significant in the past because they represent strong social connections among like students .",
    "they have in effect been working as proxies for social networks ",
    "membership in such a society puts students in a dense social network that exposes them to more students choosing to stay . ''",
    "hence it is not only integration in the general sense that matters to a student s persistence , but integration with other persisting students .",
    "tinto identifies the importance of the classroom saying `` what we do not yet know , or at least have not adequately documented , is _ how _ involvement is shaped within the context of differing institutions of higher education by student educational experiences .",
    " we have yet to explore the critical linkages between involvement in classrooms , student learning , and persistence . ''",
    "he argues that although researchers have not ignored the classroom , their findings remain disconnected from those of the field of student persistence : `` the two fields of inquiry have gone on in parallel without crossing '' @xcite .",
    "for many individuals , especially new students who have not yet formed connections in the community , the classroom is a place where connecting with others happens .",
    "that is even more the case for nonresidential students who have to manage a number of tasks outside of college and the time they spend in class is the only time they spend on campus .",
    "thus , the importance of the classroom experience as a means for improving student persistence must not be understated .",
    "with his model , tinto approached the issue of attrition from a sociological point of view , emphasizing the importance of integrating new students into the life of the institution , both socially and academically .",
    "it was noted by tinto , that `` social and academic life are interwoven and ",
    "social communities emerge out of academic activities that take place within the more limited academic sphere of the classroom a , sphere of activities that is necessarily also social in character . ''",
    "however , with the exception of a few studies @xcite , retention at the classroom level remains an open question . in our study , we want to take a fine - grained approach and look precisely at this problem .        from a methodological point of view , tinto suggested that sna might be a well - suited approach to study the in- and out - of class interaction : ``  we would be well served by  network analysis and/or social mapping of student interaction patterns .",
    " they will shed important light on how interactions across the academic and social geography of a campus shape the educational opportunity structure of campus life and , in turn , both student learning and persistence '' @xcite . given the emphasis of the modeling instruction approach on peer interaction as the process by which learning occurs",
    ", a social network perspective offers a valuable lens for investigating the association between peer interactions and students persistence @xcite .",
    "social network research has shown that individual beliefs and behaviors are shaped by social connections and likely do not result from personal attributes alone @xcite . to capture the factors that affect retention at the classroom level , we propose a simplified version of tinto s model linking classrooms , learning and persistence @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] provides a depiction of three categories of factors that we consider .",
    "in addition to individual attributes ( e.g. , gender , race , major ) and classroom context ( e.g. , traditional lecture vs. active engagement ) , we include also the in - class community .",
    "the classroom social system may alter students persistence through better access to resources resulting from interacting with instructional staff and other students ( `` knowledge access '' ) , peer influence and/or social and emotional supports .",
    "students who are highly sought by others can be viewed as having high prestige , either academically or socially ( or both ) .",
    "individuals with a large number of incoming ties may hold information or resources that other students deem useful .",
    "they may also have personalities that attract others , providing emotional support or becoming academic or social `` role models '' .",
    "individuals with positive attitudes towards sciences  individuals who are excited and passionate about the subject  may get other students more interested and engaged in the course . on the other hand , students who are not necessarily be resourceful but who are perceived by others as `` strong personalities '' can draw them away from sciences by expressing lack of interest in the subject matter .",
    "shared beliefs are developed through interaction and exposure to the beliefs of others @xcite .",
    "peer interactions are necessarily affected by the levels and types of social capital that students possess , especially in a collaborative setting @xcite .",
    " measures of position within the social network  can be used to quantify various interpersonal interactions .",
    "to collect social network data we have developed a pencil and paper survey that was administered in the introductory mechanics mi course ( fall 2014 , fall 2015 ) and in the electricity and magnetism mi course ( spring 2015 , spring 2016 ) .",
    "the survey was given every three to four weeks throughout the semester .",
    "students were asked the following question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ name the individual(s ) ( first and last name ) you had a meaningful classroom interaction * with today , even if you were not the main person speaking or contributing . _",

    "+ a classroom interaction includes but is not limited to people you worked with to solve physics problems and people that you watched or listened to while solving physics problems .",

    "starting in spring 2015 , we switched to a version of the survey that included a roster with names of all students enrolled in the course in a randomized order and of the instructional staff .",
    "moreover , since not all interactions are equally meaningful , we decided to introduce a weighted version of the question about interactions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snasp15 ] .",
    "it has been noted that `` knowing that someone else has valuable expertise is important , but their knowledge is really helpful only if they are accessible '' @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to go beyond just the number of ties one has in the network and look also at their `` quality '' .",
    "since all interactions listed are considered `` meaningful '' ( by the phrasing of the sna question ) , in our context the quality of ties is represented by the frequency of their occurrence  if student @xmath5 reported daily meaningful interactions with student @xmath6 , we considered it to be more important ( of `` higher quality '' ) than a one - time interaction . to express the importance of ties in the language of networks we assigned a numeric value to the importance of interaction by weighting them from @xmath7 to @xmath8 for any given pair of students , with weight @xmath7 being assigned to an unreported interaction .",
    "for example , if student a reported having an in - class interaction with student b every day , @xmath9 , and if student b did not mention student a on a survey , @xmath10 .    due to the intrinsically interactive nature of the relational data , it is of particular importance to define the network boundaries .",
    "not including some relevant nodes or ties may affect both the properties of the entire network and those of each individual node . in our case , the exogenously determined boundaries are defined by the enrollment in the modeling instruction course .      sna uses the notion of nodes ( in our case students enrolled in mi - m ) and edges ( the interactions identified by students on the survey ) to represent the network . from a graph theoretic perspective , the relative importance of a node within a graph is determined using centrality measures .",
    "evaluating the relative centrality of nodes in the network helps to understand the network and its participants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : centralities ] ) and to answer the question : `` who are the most important nodes in a network ? ''  @xcite .",
    "there are various measures of centrality that quantify the importance of nodes and edges . in this paper",
    "we will focus on three groups of measures : node - level centralities ( such as directed degree ) , the whole network measures ( such as betweenness and closeness ) and measures that bridge a gap between these two extremes ( such as eigenvector ) . a brief description of these measures for an unweighted network , followed by a short introduction to centrality normalization are presented below ( see , e.g. , refs  @xcite ) .",
    "_ degree _ ( also called _ total degree _ ) centrality is the number of edges directly connected to a given node .",
    "it can be thought of as a measure of connectivity . in the case of a directed network ,",
    "i.e. , a network that takes into account the origin of an edge , one can define two directional measures of degree centrality : _ indegree _  the number of ties directed to the node ( can be interpreted as popularity )  and _ outdegree _  the number of ties that the node directs to others ( can be interpreted as sociability or influence ) : @xmath11    _ eigenvector _ centrality goes beyond the node in question and looks also at the centrality of the nodes connected to it .",
    "it is defined as the sum of a node s connections to other nodes weighted by their degrees and it measures the influence of a node in a network .",
    "it is given by an eigenvector of an adjacency matrix , @xmath12 , corresponding to the greatest eigenvalue , @xmath13 .",
    "that  is @xmath14 here , @xmath12 is the adjacency matrix representation of a graph , such that @xmath15 if a node @xmath16 is connected to a node @xmath17 by an edge and @xmath7 if it is not .",
    "then @xmath18 is a vector containing the centralities of all nodes in the network .     has higher centrality than @xmath19 according to ( a ) indegree , ( b ) outdegree , ( c ) eigenvector , ( d ) betweenness and ( e ) closeness , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .",
    "[ fig : centralities ]    directed degree as well as eigenvector centrality are relatively intuitive and easy to calculate .",
    "they are local measures and the network outside of the vicinity of a node  i.e. , outside the `` ego network ''  has no direct influence on them @xcite . to assess the effect of the entire network on a given node one needs a global , system - dependent measure , that will account also for the impact of the non - directly connected nodes .",
    "the following two centralities serve this purpose .",
    "_ betweenness _ quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path linking two other nodes ( the _ geodesic _ ) .",
    "it captures the importance of a position within a whole network and can be interpreted as a measure of how much control over the flow of information , and as a consequence how much influence over the entire network , a node has .",
    "when there is only one path connecting two nodes or if a node falls on all geodesics connecting two nodes , then it has a complete control over the communication between the two other nodes . if , however , a node lies on some but not all geodesics connecting two other nodes , its potential for control is more limited and is proportional to the number of geodesics that a node lies on .",
    "betweenness is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of shortest paths linking node @xmath16 to node @xmath17 that pass through node @xmath22 , @xmath23 the number of shortest paths linking node @xmath16 to node @xmath17 .    finally , _",
    "closeness _ is a measure of how near an individual is to all other nodes in a network .",
    "it emphasizes a node s independence  a node that is close to many other nodes can easily reach others without having to rely much on intermediaries , thus gaining easy access to information or resources in the network .",
    "it is defined as the inverse of the sum of distances from all other nodes : @xmath24^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the geodesic connecting node @xmath16 to node @xmath17 . when there is no path between two nodes the total number of nodes is used in the formula instead of the path length .",

    "thomas took this approach to explore the role of student social structure ( e.g. , integration ) in persistence .",
    "he argued that the measures of centrality provide a unique empirical way to understand and quantify students structural integration into their social groups .",
    "following tinto , he suggested that sna sheds a new light on understanding student integration through individual s social ties , i.e. , `` a dimension that previous operationalizations of integration have missed '' @xcite .    as noted earlier ,",
    "tinto pointed out that both social and academic involvement influence persistence : `` the manner in which social and academic involvements ( integration ) shape learning and persistence will vary over the course of the college career and do so in differing ways for different students inside and outside the classroom '' @xcite .",
    "this intro - sequence study looking at students at the beginning of their college career is put forward to improve the understanding of the role of social and academic interactions in the process of persistence . to complement our findings",
    "we are currently employing the sna methodology to look at students experiences at the university in the middle and end of their time in college .",

    "the course structure  group assignments , common exam and lab reports , `` board meetings ''  provides many active ways for students to be involved and make connections with each other .",
    "it is thus an important case to study the effect of involvement and/or integration on persistence .    in our analysis",
    ", we examined data from four semesters ( six sections , three in fall and three in spring ) taught by two instructors .",
    "the first thing worth noticing is that the sna measures are robust when compared between different groups .",
    "the network properties , as well as correlations between centrality measures and persistence , remained fairly stable between years and sections .",
    "this stability implies authenticity of our results .",
    "our preliminary work showed a positive correlation for persistence with directed degrees and closeness , and negative for betweenness @xcite .",
    "building on this , we wanted to further investigate what information can be gained from centralities .",
    "we also wanted to go one step further and to determine whether centrality at the beginning of the second semester can be predicted by measures from the end of the preceding semester .",
    "answering the first question , we verified that students with higher centralities at the end of the first semester of mi course are in fact more likely to enroll in a second semester of mi physics .",
    "both students who reported a large number interactions and those who were often the subject of others interactions were more likely to register for the second mi course in the introductory physics sequence .",
    "node - level measures , i.e. , directed degrees , and one of the whole network - level centralities , i.e. , closeness , turned out to be positively correlated with persistence . however , betweenness had no statistically significant effect .",
    "this held true regardless of whether we included the instructional staff in our analysis or not .",
    "we also tested the impact of other factors , such as student demographics and final grades , and found grade to be the only one that made statistically significant difference .",
    "however , further analysis showed that only for indegree was grade alone a better predictor .",
    "for outdegree and closeness , models with two dependent variables ( i.e. , grade and centrality ) gave the best fit .",
    "to explain these findings one needs to understand what centrality measures mean in the classroom context .",
    "degree - based measures are concerned with communication activity .",
    "they capture students direct interactions with one another .",
    "indegree helps to identify individuals sought by others , well - linked possibly because they are knowledgeable , supportive or helpful .",
    "outdegree , on the other hand , reveals students who reach out to others .",
    "they might do so because they need help or because they want to offer help and support to others .",
    "some students like discussing their ideas to reaffirm their knowledge , others learn best from peer - to - peer interactions .",
    "the reasons for interacting with others are plenty .",
    "understanding how and why students build communities is essential to improving their experiences in and beyond the classroom .",
    "concern with either independence or efficiency leads to the choice of a measure based upon closeness .",
    "it can be thought of as strong embeddedness within the entire network .",
    "students with high closeness scores are close to all the other students in the network and thus they have easy access to information from many sources .",
    "they are also  by sheer nature of this measure  connected to many students and might experience better social and emotional support .",
    "this , in turn , can help them appreciate all the benefits of having strong network connections within a classroom .",
    "closeness is related to degrees of separation .",
    "students who had low degree of separation from everyone else in the classroom were more likely to persist in the mi sequence of introductory physics courses .",
    "this held true regardless of the grade students received in the course .",
    "betweenness , on the other hand , depends mainly on the position within the network . in practice , in order to have high betweenness it suffices to connect groups that would otherwise be otherwise separate .",
    "students with high betweenness score are not necessarily connected to many other students , but their connections are formed in a particular way .",
    "thus , this measure will only be significant when the throughput or flow of information is relevant , but not necessarily when network connections are a source of support ( which , e.g. , implicitly or explicitly encourage students to persist ) .    knowing the correlation between centralities and persistence leads to a natural question about the likelihood that students with indices within a certain range will actually continue their education . to tackle this problem we relied on the concept of entropy of a random variable .",
    "the mutual information gave us a threshold that optimizes predictability for each centrality .",
    "then we derived the probability of correctly inferring the persistence based on centrality . knowing how likely students are to persist is particularly important when there still is time to take actions to help them through classroom interventions designed to further promote integration .",
    "since in order to know students grades one has to wait until after the end of the semester and the sna data collection took place a couple of weeks before final exams , in our estimation we decided not to include the grade , even when it improved the model .    in our proposed model , we hypothesized that demographic information and the classroom context combined with centrality measures would predict persistence .",
    "however , with the exception of final grade , we found no impact of the personal factors in the logistic regression models .",
    "the reason for the unusual absence of this effect might be the atypical gender and ethnicity distribution for a science class , with females accounting for @xmath41 of the population and traditionally underrepresented ethnicities accounting for @xmath42 . as for the classroom context , all sections of our study followed the modeling instruction curriculum .",
    "also , we assumed the faculty support and the teacher / student ratio factors to be comparable between sections since the review session and exams were coordinated and all students had access to tas and las . while our analysis could benefit from a comparison with a traditionally taught course , a previous study found no network development in a non - interactive classroom @xcite .",
    "thus , with the cost of additional data collection outweighting the potential gains , we decided to put off surveying non - mi students for the time being .",
    "we were also interested in determining whether students participation in fall mi and their position within the classroom network by the end of the semester can say anything about their position in the network at the beginning of the following semester .",
    "are students who already experienced the mi collaborative environment more likely to make connections ?",
    "do they tend to connect with people they already know from previous semester ? based on our analysis , closeness turned out to be the most robust measure .",
    "we found positive correlations for this centrality regardless of whether we controlled for section , year or instructor or if we treated as a variable simply taking the mi - m course ( a binary `` yes / no '' predictor ) . in each case closeness",
    "was significantly correlated with the predicting factor .",
    "moreover , each measure was positively correlated with its counterpart from the last collection of the fall semester .",
    "it is also worth noting that ties involving students who took mi - m accounted for about @xmath43 of all interactions ( @xmath44 of which were initiated by returning students ) , while connections only between people new to the mi course constituted less than @xmath45 .    in conclusion",
    ", this study suggests that student social integration influences persistence .",
    "it is important to stress that there is no guarantee that increasing students centrality by encouraging their interactions will lead to better persistence .",
    "further study is needed to test for the effect of increasing embededness within the classroom network through , e.g. , structured and purposeful mixing of students .",
    "our findings , however , suggest that it actually may help .",
    "we found that different types of social integration are quantified by different measures of centrality and correlates with persistence differently  some greatly , some when subject to specific conditions ( instructor , year ) and some not at all .",
    "network analysis is a tool that allows us to study the link between involvement and persistence in a quantitative , empirical and meaningful way .",
    "it thus gives a tool to access  in real time ",
