    "predicting the macroscopic properties of composite or porous materials with random microstructures is an important problem in a range of fields  @xcite .",
    "there now exist large - scale computational methods for calculating the properties of composites given a digital representation of their microstructure ; eg .",
    "permeability  @xcite , conductivity  @xcite and elastic moduli  @xcite .",
    "a critical problem is obtaining an accurate three - dimensional ( 3d ) description of this microstructure  @xcite .",
    "for particular materials it may be possible to simulate microstructure formation from first principles .",
    "generally this relies on detailed knowledge of the physics and chemistry of the system , with accurate modeling of each material requiring a significant amount of research .",
    "three - dimensional models have also been directly reconstructed from samples by combining digitized serial sections obtained by scanning electron microscopy @xcite , or using the relatively new technique of x - ray microtomography  @xcite . in the absence of sophisticated experimental facilities , or a sufficiently detailed description of the microstructure formation ( for computer simulation ) ,",
    "a third alternative is to employ a statistical model of the microstructure .",
    "this procedure has been termed `` statistical reconstruction '' since the statistical properties of the model are matched to those of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) image  @xcite .",
    "statistical reconstruction is a promising method of producing 3d models , but there remain outstanding theoretical questions regarding its application .",
    "first , what is the most appropriate statistical information ( in a 2d image ) for reconstructing a 3d image , and second , is this information sufficient to produce a useful model ? in this paper we address these questions , and test the method against experimental data .    modeling a composite and numerically estimating its macroscopic properties is a complex procedure .",
    "this could be avoided if accurate analytical structure - property relations could be theoretically or empirically obtained .",
    "many studies have focussed on this problem  @xcite . in general , the results are reasonable for a particular class of composites or porous media . the self - consistent ( or effective medium )",
    "method of hill  @xcite and budiansky  @xcite and its generalization by christensen and lo  @xcite is one of the most common for particulate media  @xcite .",
    "no analogous results are available for non - particulate composites .",
    "a promising alternative to direct property prediction has been the development of analytical rigorous bounds ( reviewed by willis  @xcite , hashin  @xcite and torquato  @xcite ) .",
    "there is a whole hierarchy of these bounds , each set tighter than the next , but depending on higher and higher order correlation functions of the microstructure .",
    "the original hashin and shtrikman  @xcite bounds that have been widely used by experimentalists implicitly depend on the two - point correlation function of the microstructure , although the only quantities appearing in the formulas are the individual properties of each phase and their volume fractions . to go beyond these bounds to higher - order",
    ", more restrictive ( i.e. , narrower ) bounds , it is necessary that detailed information be known about the composite in the form of three - point or higher statistical correlation functions  @xcite , which do appear explicitly in the relevant formulas .",
    "evaluation of even the three point function is a formidable task , so use of these bounds has in the past been restricted to composites with spherical inclusions .",
    "it is now possible to evaluate the bounds for non - particulate composites  @xcite , and it is interesting to compare the results with experimental and numerical data . if the properties of each phase are not too dissimilar the bounds are quite restrictive and can be used for predictive purposes  @xcite .",
    "sometimes experimental properties closely follow one or the other of the bounds , so that the upper or lower bound often provides a reasonable prediction of the actual property even when the phases have very different properties  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to test this observation .    in this study",
    "we test a generalized version  @xcite of quiblier s  @xcite statistical reconstruction procedure on a well - characterized silver - tungsten composite .",
    "computational estimates of the young s moduli are compared to experimental measurements .",
    "the composite is bi - continuous ( both phases are macroscopically connected ) and therefore has a non - particulate character .",
    "as such the microstructure is broadly representative of that observed in open - cell foams ( such as aerogels ) , polymer blends , porous rocks , and cement - based materials . by comparing our computations of the moduli to the results of the self - consistent method we can test its utility for non - particulate media .",
    "an advantage of the reconstruction procedure we use is that it provides the statistical correlation functions necessary for evaluating the three - point bounds .",
    "comparison of the young s modulus to the bounds therefore allows us to determine the bounds range of application for predictive purposes .",
    "the two basic models we employ to describe two - phase composite microstructure are the overlapping sphere model and the level - cut gaussian random field ( grf ) model . in this section",
    "we review the statistical properties of these models which are useful for reconstructing composites .",
    "the simplest , and most common , quantities used to characterize random microstructure are @xmath3 , the volume fraction of phase 1 , @xmath4 , the surface area to total volume ratio and @xmath5 , the two - point correlation function ( or @xmath6/[p - p^2]$ ] the auto - correlation function ) .",
    "@xmath5 represents the probability that two points a distance @xmath7 apart lie in phase 1 .",
    "here we only consider isotropic materials where @xmath8 does not depend on direction . also note that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "realizations of the overlapping sphere model  @xcite are generated by randomly placing spheres ( of radii @xmath11 ) into a matrix .",
    "the correlation function of the phase exterior to the spheres ( fraction @xmath3 ) is @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the surface to volume ratio is @xmath17 . with modification",
    "it is also possible to incorporate poly - dispersed and/or hollow spheres .",
    "the overlapping sphere model is the most well characterized of a wider class called boolean models , which have been recently reviewed by stoyan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the internal interfaces of a different class of composites can be modeled by the iso - surfaces ( or level - cuts ) of a stationary correlated gaussian random field ( grf ) @xmath18 ( so called because the value of the field at randomly chosen points in space is gaussian distributed ) . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath19 is fixed , the distribution over an ensemble will also be gaussian .",
    "correlations in the field are governed by the field - field correlation function @xmath20 which can be specified subject to certain constraints [ @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "invariably @xmath23 is taken as unity .",
    "a useful general form for @xmath24 is  @xcite @xmath25 the resulting field is characterized by a correlation length @xmath26 , domain scale @xmath27 and a cut - off scale @xmath28 .",
    "the cut - off scale is necessary to ensure @xmath29 as @xmath30 ; fractal iso - surfaces are generated if @xmath31 .",
    "there are many algorithmic methods of generating random fields .",
    "a straight forward method is to sum @xmath32 ( @xmath331000 ) sinusoids with random phase and wave - vector @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a uniform deviate on @xmath36 and @xmath37 is uniformly distributed on a unit sphere .",
    "the magnitude of the wave vectors @xmath38 are distributed on @xmath39 with a probability ( spectral ) density @xmath40 .",
    "the density is related to @xmath41 by a fourier transform [ @xmath41=@xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath43 specifies an additional constraint on @xmath41 .",
    "although this formulation of a grf is intuitive , the fast fourier transform method is more efficient  @xcite .    following berk @xcite one",
    "can define a composite with phase 1 occupying the region in space where @xmath44 and phase 2 occupying the remainder .",
    "the statistics of the material are completely determined by the specification of the level - cut parameters and the function @xmath41 ( or @xmath40 ) .",

    "( [ modelg ] ) . many more models ( for which @xmath5 can be simply evaluated ) can be formed from the intersection and union sets of the overlapping sphere and level - cut grf models . here",
    "we define a few representative models which have been shown to be applicable to composite and porous media .",
    "a normal model ( n ) corresponds to berk s formulation .",
    "models can also be formed from the intersection ( i ) and union ( u ) of two statistically identical level - cut grf s .",
    "another model , i@xmath54 , formed from the intersection of @xmath55 primary models , has also been found useful .",

    "[ cf_young ] .",
    "for the temperature region below the melting point of silver the maximum error is 4% , a very good result . above the melting point of silver , when the silver phase is taken to have a zero bulk and shear modulus , the error is only 3% .",
    "the agreement may actually be better than that , however .",
    "since the elastic measurements were dynamic measurements , the liquid silver can be considered as being trapped on the time scale of the experimental measurement , before any significant flow could take place , and so could still contribute to the effective moduli via its non - zero liquid bulk modulus . just before melting",
    ", the silver had a bulk modulus of about 35gpa .",
    "if we take the bulk modulus to be somewhat lower , in analogy to the ice - water difference around 0@xmath1c , then a bulk modulus of 23.1gpa causes the n ( @xmath62=0 ) model to agree perfectly with experiment at temperature points above the melting point of silver .    the bounds are also shown in fig .",
    "[ cf_young ] . for model n ( @xmath62=0 )",
    "the microstructure parameters are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the results bound the experimental data and provide a reasonable prediction of the young s modulus below the melting point of silver . note that even if the silver phase is given a non - zero bulk modulus past its melting point , the zero shear modulus causes the lower bounds for shear modulus and therefore young s modulus to be identically zero .",
    "unfortunately , there was no reported poisson s ratio results for the composite , so we can not compare to the model results for this quantity .",
    "we now compare the different analytical predictions of effective moduli with the finite element data .",
    "we have chosen to study the two most common models and only consider the moduli appropriate for the w - ag composite studied above .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "cf_thy](a ) for overlapping spheres and in fig .",
    "[ cf_thy](b ) for the single level - cut grf or excursion set of quiblier [ model n(@xmath62=0 ) ] .",
    "the self - consistent method provides a very good estimate of @xmath65 for model n(@xmath62=0 ) , but not for overlapping spheres .",
    "this might be expected because the n(@xmath62=0 ) model is symmetric with respect to phase - interchange ( like the scm ) while the overlapping sphere model is not . as stated above the application of the generalized",
    "scm is difficult because it is not obvious which phase should be chosen as the ` inclusion ' phase . for the overlapping sphere model",
    "the tungsten phase is comprised of spheres ( at 80% volume fraction ) , so is the more likely choice for the inclusion phase .",
    "nevertheless , we report both estimates ( 80% w inclusions and 20% ag matrix or 20% ag inclusions and 80% w matrix ) for both models . for either choice",
    ", the gscm fails to provide an accurate estimate .",
    "indeed , above the melting point of silver the gscm vanishes for the case 20% ag matrix case since the matrix phase is now completely soft . for the overlapping sphere model the beran , molyneux ,",
    "milton and phan  thien bounds are calculated using the microstructure parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "below the melting point of silver ( where the contrast between the phases is moderate ) the upper bounds provide a very good estimate of the effective moduli .    a brief discussion of the effect of elastic contrast is necessary here .",
    "we have already noted that the analytical predictions of effective moduli do not explicitly depend on microstructure , but have a  built - in \" microstructure .",
    "the elastic contrast , the ratio between the phase moduli , will determine how sensitive the effective moduli actually are to microstructure .",
    "for example , in the case of a two - phase composite having equal shear moduli but different bulk moduli , there is a simple exact formula for the effective bulk modulus which is totally insensitive to microstructure  @xcite . in the case of small contrast , the effective moduli can be expressed exactly as a power series in the moduli differences  @xcite . up to second order in this difference , at any volume fraction",
    ", the coefficients of the power series are not dependent on anything but the volume fractions and the individual phase properties .",
    "therefore at small contrast , analytical predictions of effective moduli that explicitly depend only on volume fractions and phase moduli should all work well .",
    "( a )    ( b )",
    "throughout this paper , we have treated the finite element computation method as being perfectly accurate , so that comparisons of elastic results to experiment were solely a test of how well the reconstructed microstructure compared to the real microstructure .",
    "this is not exactly true , since there are numerical errors in the finite element method  @xcite .",
    "these are small , however , and are generally of about the same size or less than the differences seen between model computations and experimental data for the elastic moduli .",
    "there are also statistical sampling errors associated with the finite size ( @xmath6840@xmath69 m ) of the models we employ to estimate the elastic properties .",
    "since this is much greater than the correlation length of the samples ( @xmath685@xmath69 m - see fig .",
    "[ cf_p2 ] ) we again assume these errors to be small . therefore , the good agreement between model prediction and experimental data seen in this paper is good evidence that the model considered is indeed capturing the main aspects of the experimental microstructure .",
    "we have compared various theoretical results to finite element computations of the effective young s modulus @xmath65 for non - particulate media : a w - ag composite and two model media ( overlapping spheres and a single - cut gaussian random field ) .",
    "the generalized self - consistent method ( derived for particulate composites ) did not provide a good estimate of @xmath65 for the bi - continuous materials considered here . the standard self - consistent method provided a good estimate for the single - cut grf and w - ag composite .",
    "since the method predicts zero moduli for porosity above 50% but the solid phase of the single - cut grf remains connected up to porosities of around 90%  @xcite such agreement can not be general .",
    "upper bounds , calculated using three - point statistical correlation functions , provided a good prediction at low contrast ( @xmath70/@xmath71 6 ) for each composite .",
    "when one of the phases was completely soft the bounds lost predictive value . therefore , for general composites , it is important to employ numerical computations of the effective moduli . for accurate numerical prediction of composite properties",
    "it is important that a realistic model be used .",
    "model - based statistical reconstruction , based on the joshi - quiblier - adler approach , appears to be a viable route for microstructural simulation .",
    "however , it is important that the models underlying the procedure be capable of mimicking the composite microstructure .",
    "we have shown how several different models can be employed to find a useful reconstruction .",
