    "one of the main achievements of the qcd sum rules ( sr ) approach @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is that it enabled to express the nucleon mass in terms of the qcd quark condensates .",
    "the nucleon mass was found to depend mainly on the value of the scalar quark condensate @xmath2 .",
    "the approach is based on the dispersion relations for the function @xmath3 describing the propagation of the system with the four - momentum @xmath4 and the quantum numbers of the hadron . in the case of proton",
    "there are two functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , corresponding to the two structures in the propagator of a fermion .",
    "the dispersion relations are considered at @xmath7 .",
    "this makes possible to carry out expansion of the functions @xmath8 in powers of @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are the qcd condensates .",
    "this is known as the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "it is important that in expectation values the qcd operators are taken in the same space - time point .    however , the structure of the qcd vacuum is more complicated @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are strong gluon fields localized on the distances @xmath0 of the order @xmath10fm which are known as instantons .",
    "the instantons produce the quark - antiquark pairs which are present in the qcd vacuum with a nonzero density . at the large distances @xmath11 one deals with the averaged density @xmath12 in which both quarks are at the same point .",
    "however at smaller distances @xmath13 one should take into account that the quark operators act in different points .",
    "in other words one should include the instantons into the sr .",
    "the contribution of the instantons into the sr were considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "actually the authors of @xcite-@xcite were interested in description of the quark correlations in the polarization operator due to interaction with the same instanton .",
    "in other words the authors considered the instanton correction to the green function of _ two _ quarks but neglect the instanton effect in the propagation of one quark where just the `` mean field '' scalar condensate @xmath2 was included . in @xcite",
    "the authors calculated the polarization operator of the nucleon current basing on description of the light quark in instanton medium developed in @xcite , @xcite . in papers @xcite,@xcite",
    "the qcd vacuum contains a correlated system of instantons and antiinstantons of the size @xmath14fm separated by the distances @xmath15 fm .    in this approach the propagator of a light ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 )",
    "quark is described by the green function , written in euclidean space as @xmath18 the quark mass @xmath19 depends the average instanton size @xmath0 .",
    "it is also proportional to the density of the instantons @xmath20 , where @xmath1 is the average distance between the instantons .",
    "the calculations in @xcite were carried out at fixed values @xmath21",
    "i.e. @xmath22 gev@xmath23 gev@xmath24 , @xmath25 gev@xmath26 gev@xmath24 , providing reasonable value for the nucleon mass .",
    "however , there is certain distribution in @xmath0 around the value @xmath27 .",
    "also , the value of @xmath1 is connected with the value of the gluon condensates which is assumed to be totaly produced by the instantons @xmath28 the value of this condensate is also known with certain errors .",
    "thus one needs to analyze the dependence of the nucleon mass on possible variation of these parameters .",
    "it is also important to study the behavior of the nucleon residue @xmath29 during these variations . assuming that the three valence quarks of the nucleon can be described in terms of quantum mechanics , the value of @xmath29 can be identified with the square of the wave function @xmath30 of the three quarks at the origin .",
    "if there is one scale of distances @xmath31 , it can be treated as the size of the nucleon one can put @xmath32 .",
    "thus the change of the value of @xmath29 by the value of @xmath33 leads to the change of the size of the nucleon @xmath34 also , variation of the effective threshold @xmath35 can be treated as variation of masses of the higher states with the quantum numbers of the baryons .",
    "we carry out our analysis for two cases .",
    "first we neglect the correlations between the quarks in polarization operator , describing each of them by the propagator ( [ 1 ] ) . in the second case",
    "we include the influence of the gluon condensate on the two quarks simultaneously . in @xcite,@xcite all",
    "the gluon condensate is assumed to be originated by instantons .",
    "its action on each quark separately is included in the propagator ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "however , there is also a contribution corresponding to the gluons interacting with different quarks of the polarization operator @xcite .",
    "note that inclusion of the averaged gluon condensate @xmath36 is not selfconsistent in this approach .",
    "the gluon field is also inhomogeneous and should be described by an explicit instanton configuration .",
    "the described way of inclusion of correlations beyond the independent particle approach overestimates its effect .    as a first step we can vary the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 independently .",
    "however , these values are related by the condition of equilibrium of the instanton medium and should be varied simultaneously .",
    "we demonstrate that variation of the parameters can change the value of the nucleon mass by about @xmath37mev .    in sec .",
    "2 we present the dependence of the sr equations on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "3 we vary the parameters in independent way . in sec .",
    "4 we vary them in a selfconsistent way .",
    "we summarize in sec .  5 .",
    "the borel transformed qcd sr in the instanton medium can be written as @xcite @xmath38 and @xmath39 here eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) corresponds to the @xmath40 structure of the polarization operator , while eq .",

    "the lower indices denote the dimensions of the condensates in the ope version of the sr .",
    "the contributions to eq .",

    "the terms with odd @xmath45 contribute to eq .",

    "@xmath48 @xmath49 here we defined @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the term @xmath52 the gluon condensate is included .",
    "it is @xmath53 while @xmath54 .",
    "while the contributions @xmath46 and @xmath52 , in which the integrands contain the value @xmath55 are saturated by @xmath56 , the term @xmath57 contains the factor @xmath58 in the integrand .",
    "the region @xmath59 becomes important .",
    "here we need a parametrization of the propagator @xmath60 .",
    "we employ @xmath61 the power of denominator is determined by the asymptotic behavior @xmath62 at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are fixed by the values of the effective quark mass @xmath66 and by the value of the scalar condensate @xmath67 thus @xmath68    employing parametrization ( [ 25 ] ) we find @xmath69 @xmath70 here @xmath71 , while @xmath72 . also @xmath73 and @xmath74    now we write down the dependence of the input parameters on the actual values of @xmath0 and@xmath1 .",
    "we denote by the lower index @xmath75 the values corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath76 defined by eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we introduce @xmath77 we find immediately that for the gluon condensate ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) @xmath78 and also @xcite @xmath79 also , since @xmath80 , one finds @xmath81 .",
    "however , in order to obtain the dependence of the integrals @xmath82 and @xmath83 one should carry out the computations of the functions @xmath84 for various values of @xmath0 and@xmath1 .",
    "now we modify the values of @xmath0 keeping @xmath85fm . in this case @xmath86 . for the parameters of parametrization given by eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) we find @xmath87 while @xmath88 .",
    "also the scalar quark condensate @xmath89 .",
    "note that the condensate @xmath90 is related to the normalization point @xmath91 mev .",
    "the value at the conventional point @xmath92 can be presented as @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the qcd scale .",
    "thus @xmath96 .",
    "the results of calculations is presented in table 1 .",
    "the consistency of the lhs and rhs of the sr is illustrated by fig.1 .",
    "starting with the case of independent particle approximation ( the terms @xmath97 are not included ) we see that the value of the nucleon mass is very stable , changing by about several percent while @xmath0 changes by about @xmath98 around the point @xmath99 . the same estimations are true for the case when the correlations described by the term @xmath97 are included . the results for a larger interval of the values of @xmath0 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "here we shall modify the values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "we start by changing @xmath1 and @xmath0 keeping @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath101 .",
    "the results of computations are presented in table 2 .",
    "one can see that in the independent particle approximation the value of the mass changes only by about 20 mev while we change the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by about @xmath102 .",
    "the variation of the nucleon residue and that of the nucleon size @xmath31 is more pronounced .",
    "it increases by about @xmath102 if we decrease the magnitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by these values .",
    "also the value of the effective continuum threshold diminishes , making the  pole+ continuum \" model of the spectrum less reliable .",
    "note that the value of the scalar condensate also becomes noticeably smaller .",
    "note that the accuracy of the solution of the sr equations become worse while we diminish the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we illustrate this statement by demonstrating the lsh and rhs of the sr at @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath104 the value of @xmath105 per point exceeds unity .",
    "thus we would rather state that there is no solution for these values of @xmath106 . note also that the value @xmath103 corresponds to @xmath107 gev@xmath108 , i.e. for normalization at @xmath109gev @xmath110mev@xmath111    if the correlations caused by the gluon condensate are involved the results for variation of the nucleon mass do not change much .",
    "however , the values of @xmath29 and @xmath35 become more stable while we change the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the results are also given in table 2 .",
    "now we change @xmath0 and @xmath1 keeping the scalar condensate @xmath112 to be constant and putting @xmath113 gev@xmath108 .",
    "thus @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and variation of @xmath1 provides a twice stronger variation of @xmath0 . as well as in previous cases the value of @xmath116 increases with increasing of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the previous cases the values of @xmath29 and @xmath35 increase with increasing of @xmath0 . in all cases",
    "the @xmath0 dependence becomes more smooth if we include the gluon condensate - see table 3 .",
    "similar tendency remains for a smaller value @xmath117 gev@xmath108 .",
    "however in this case the influence of correlations appears to be much stronger , shifting the value of the nucleon mass from @xmath118 gev ( at @xmath99 ) to @xmath119 gev .",
    "we analyzed the dependence of the solutions of the qcd sum rules equations in instanton medium on the average size of the instantons @xmath0 and on distance of between the instantons @xmath1 .",
    "we considered several versions of varying the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we tried the version with @xmath120 , @xmath121 and also kept the scalar condensate @xmath12 to be constant . in the latter case @xmath122 .",
    "we also compared the results in the independent particle approximation and those with inclusion of the correlations due to the gluon condensate , in which two gluons interact with two different quarks .",
    "the general tendency is that the nucleon mass drops while we increase the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the average modification of the value is about @xmath123 mev while we modify the value of @xmath0 by @xmath98 . in the cases @xmath120 and @xmath121 this change is accompanied by decreasing of the values of @xmath29 . and @xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to increase of the size of the nucleon by about @xmath124 .",
    "also the continuum threshold becomes smaller , corresponding to lower masses of the excited states . for @xmath121 the larger value @xmath125 without correlations",
    "changes to a smaller one ( about @xmath126 ) after the correlations are included .    keeping the constant value of the scalar condensate we find that the values of @xmath29 and @xmath35 decrease while @xmath0 increases .",
    "this makes the `` pole+continuum '' model for the rhs of the sr more reliable . here",
    "the size of the nucleon drops while we increase @xmath0 changing as @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "the change becomes much smaller after we include the correlations .",
    ".behavior of the solution with variation of @xmath0 at @xmath129fm . the numbers above the horizontal line correspond to independent quarks in the polarization operator . the numbers below the horizontal line correspond to approximate inclusion of correlations",
