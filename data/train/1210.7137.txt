    "august 18 , 1851 is the date of birth generally agreed upon for statistical linguistics @xcite . on that day , augustus de morgan ( 18061871 ) sent a letter to a friend , suggesting statistical counts to settle authorship disputes @xcite .",
    "this later inspired the first statistical study of the kind by t. c. mendenhall ( 18411924 ) @xcite .",
    "four centuries before , leon battista alberti ( 14041472 ) , had made a curious remark on the frequency of vowels among poets and orators .",
    "the first observation of the kind ever , it has remained unnoticed since .",
    "that remark , and its statistical verification , are the subject of this note .",
    "alberti , the well known polymath of italian renaissance , has been hailed as a pioneer in quite different domains @xcite : architecture , grammar , mathematics , etc .",
    "his `` de componendis cifris '' , written in 1466 or 1467 , stands out as the first western text in the history of cryptology @xcite .",
    "the latin text is available online @xcite ; several translations have been published , among which we shall mainly quote @xcite ; we have also used an early italian translation by c. bartoli @xcite , and m. furno s french translation @xcite .",
    "our focus is on the following passage of section iv .    _",

    "contrarily to note 3 in @xcite , we believe that the correct translation of `` ex octava '' in the first sentence is indeed `` one eighth '' , as in several other translations . for convenience , the proportion of vowels for poets will be denoted by @xmath0 , being aware that what precisely is meant by `` poets '' and `` vowels '' , is far from clear at this point .",
    "we believe that alberti s assertion can be mathematically translated into @xmath1 , or else @xmath2 .",
    "alberti opposes poets to `` rhetores '' , i.e. orators , for which the proportion of vowels against consonants is said to be `` sesquitertia '' , translated by @xcite as `` del terzo piu '' , or else four against three .",
    "if we denote by @xmath3 the proportion of vowels for orators ( with the same precautions as before ) , what is stated is @xmath4 , or else @xmath5 .",
    "the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is smaller than @xmath8 : how did alberti observe and justify such a small difference ?",
    "the last sentence of the passage contains a hint . at first glance , saying that for 300 vowels , 400 consonants are counted , seems redundant , once the proportion has been set to 3:4 .",
    "yet `` de componendis cifris '' is a rather short and concentrated text , and no sentence is superfluous .",
    "mentioning a page of 700 letters might have been alberti s way of indicating that his observations were supported by counts on large enough sets of letters , i.e. the modern notion of sample size .",
    "admittedly , alberti is far from being the first to have counted letters .",
    "six centuries before , al kind ( ca .",
    "801873 ) had written a `` manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages '' @xcite . remarkably similar in its organization and contents to alberti s `` de componendis cifris '' , al kind s treatise contains a table of letter frequencies , much more detailed than alberti s observations .",
    "it also contains quite accurate linguistic observations on poetry and prose .",
    "similar counts and remarks can also be found in later arab treatises , in particular that of ibn dunaynr ( 11871229 ) @xcite . nevertheless , all arab treatises , as well as all western writings after alberti until the middle of the 19^th^ century , viewed letter frequencies as a _ characteristic of a language_. alberti was the first to assert that a stylistic difference ( poetry vs. oration ) in the same language , could yield a quantifiable difference in letter frequencies .",
    "our first objective was to investigate whether alberti s observations could be justified , by modern statistical standards .",
    "we gathered a corpus of classical latin texts , from 10 different poets and as many different orators , totalling over 5 million letters .",
    "the letter frequency analysis encountered the difficulty of distinguishing the uses of _ u _ and _ i _ , as vowel or consonant .",
    "a counting algorithm was proposed , based on classical latin grammar . using that grammatical algorithm",
    ", the vowel counts did show a clear difference between poets and orators : poets use consistently more _ a _",
    "s , _ e _ s and _ y _ s , whereas orators use more of the other vowels .",
    "however , the total percentages of vowels among poets ( @xmath9 ) and among orators ( @xmath10 ) were not significantly different , the percentage among orators being even slightly higher .",
    "another counting algorithm did meet alberti s observations : it consisted in counting as consonants all _ i _",
    "s before another vowel .",
    "even though it can not be asserted that our counting algorithm matches his , we believe that our results support alberti s observations , and that he had indeed detected the quantitative difference between poets and orators . our second objective was to calculate how many pages of 700 letters would have been necessary to statistically assess alberti s observations .",
    "we translated them into 3 statistical tests , and computed the number of pages necessary to raise the power of the tests to @xmath11 , at threshold @xmath12 .",
    "detailed results will be reported for the 3 tests , using both the classical bernoulli model , and a monte - carlo study on the corpus .",
    "one of our conclusions is that , randomly selecting 2 pages in each of the 20 texts of our corpus would suffice to ensure a power of @xmath11 for the test of @xmath13 against @xmath14 .",
    "alberti is known as a sholar of immense culture , a lover of litterature , grammar and alphabets : see @xcite and in particular note 127 p.  xliii of @xcite .",
    "he might well have counted letters in 40 pages of poems and orations : he could definitely have proved his assertions ",
    "had he known statistics . as he says in section iii @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i went about this with not indifferent industry or care , reflecting again and again on the elements of writing , and investigating intensely until i had clear in mind some fundamental concepts , which now the most brilliant minds will acknowledge as having contributed to understanding the whole question of ciphers .",

    "not being known as an orator , vitruvius was included because his `` de architectura '' was an important source of inspiration for alberti @xcite .",
    "statistical evidence showed that both texts behaved similarly to those of other orators regarding letter counts .",
    "if vowels are counted on the basis of the occurrence of characters _ a _ , _ e _ , _ i _ , _ o _ , _ u _ , _ y _ , alberti s assertions can hardly be justified : the vowel proportions are far from the announced values ( @xmath15 for poets and @xmath16 for orators instead of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "moreover , the vowel percentage is not consistently higher for poets .",
    "however , it is a well known particularity of latin grammar that the letters _",

    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ after the vowel o is sometimes found the i and also the u , but this is rather rare , while more frequently the o is followed by the u used as a consonant , as in ` ovem ' .    [  ]    in fact , neither i or v used as consonants ever follow the vowels in a syllable , and neither does q.    [  ]    in monosyllabic words the vowels can be followed by all the consonants except f , g , p , q , i , and v.    [  ]    in contrast , within a word , there are some consonants that never appear in the next syllable after v and the consonant i. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the usage in rendering vocalic [ i ] , [ u ] and consonantal [ j ] , [ w ] into letters has varied , even for classical latin . in our corpus ,",
    "the letter _ i _ ( lower or upper case ) always denoted either sounds [ i ] and [ j ] .",
    "lower case _ v _ s were rather rare , and upper case _",
    "_ s never appeared . in order to define what might be called a `` grammatical count '' ,",
    "we have used both alberti s own remarks , together with the rules that can be found in most latin grammars , such as @xcite . here",
    "are the counting rules that were implemented .",
    "* _ i _ or _ i _ was counted as a consonant : * * at the beginning of a word before a vowel , * * after prefixes _ ad , ab , conj , ex _ , and before another vowel , * * between two vowels . * _ u _ or _ u _ was counted as a consonant : * * at the beginning of a word before a vowel , * * after _ q _ and _ g _ , and before a vowel , * * between two vowels , * _ v _ or _ v _ was counted as a vowel before a consonant .",
    "our choice to count _ qu _ as two consonants instead of one is disputable : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we believe it is supported by the following remark in section vi , @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ on the other hand , when it was established that the u is combined with the q , it does nt appear to have been taken into account that the u itself is implicit in this letter q , so it sounds like ku . _",
