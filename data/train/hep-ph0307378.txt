    "a precise and model independent determination of the magnitudes of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath4 is important for testing the standard model at @xmath0 factories via the comparison of the angles and the sides of the unitarity triangle .",
    "@xmath1 is notoriously hard to measure model - independently .",
    "the first extraction of @xmath1 from experimental data relied on a study of the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath0 decay  @xcite , a region in which ( as will be discussed ) the rate is highly model - dependent .",
    "@xmath1 has also been measured from exclusive semileptonic @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay  @xcite .",
    "these exclusive determinations also suffer from model dependence , as they rely on form factor models ( such as light - cone sum rules @xcite ) or quenched lattice calculations at the present time ( for a review of recent lattice results , see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , inclusive decays are quite simple theoretically , and if it were not for the huge background from decays to charm , it would be straightforward to determine @xmath1 from inclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "inclusive @xmath0 decay rates can be computed model independently in a series in @xmath7 and @xmath8 using the heavy quark expansion ( hqe )  @xcite . at leading order ,",
    "the @xmath0 meson decay rate is equal to the @xmath9 quark decay rate .",
    "the leading nonperturbative corrections of order @xmath10 are characterized by two heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) matrix elements , usually called @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these matrix elements also occur in the expansion of the @xmath0 and @xmath13 masses in powers of @xmath7 , @xmath14 similar formulae hold for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 masses . the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath11 are independent of the heavy @xmath9 quark mass , while there is a weak logarithmic scale dependence in @xmath12 .",
    "the measured @xmath18 mass splitting fixes @xmath19 , while @xmath3 ( or , more precisely , a well - defined short - distance mass such as @xmath20 @xcite ) and @xmath11 may be determined from other physical quantities ( as will be discussed in the second part of this talk ) .",
    "since the parton level decay rate is proportional to @xmath21 , the uncertainty in @xmath3 is a dominant source of uncertainty in the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath1 ; an uncertainty in @xmath3 of @xmath23 mev corresponds to a @xmath24 determination of @xmath1@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath25 rate can only be measured imposing severe cuts on the phase space to eliminate the @xmath26 times larger @xmath27 background .",
    "since the predictions of the ope are only model independent for sufficiently inclusive observables , these cuts can destroy the convergence of the expansion .",
    "this is the case for two kinematic regions for which the charm background is absent and which have received much attention : the large lepton energy region , @xmath28 , and the small hadronic invariant mass region , @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the poor behaviour of the ope for these quantities is slightly subtle , because in both cases there is sufficient phase space for many different resonances to be produced in the final state , so an inclusive description of the decays is still appropriate .",
    "however , in both of these regions of phase space the @xmath30 decay products are dominated by high energy , low invariant mass hadronic states , @xmath31 in this region the differential rate is very sensitive to the details of the wave function of the @xmath9 quark in the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "this can be seen simply from the kinematics .",
    "a @xmath9 quark in a @xmath0 meson has momentum @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the four - velocity of the quark , and @xmath34 is a small residual momentum of order @xmath35 . if the momentum transfer to the final state leptons is @xmath36 , the invariant mass of the final state hadrons is @xmath37 over most of phase space , the second term is suppressed relative to the first by one power of @xmath7 , and so may be treated as a perturbation .",
    "this corresponds to the usual ope .",
    "however , in the region ( [ shapefnregime ] ) @xmath38 is large and @xmath39 is small , @xmath40 is almost light - like , and the first two terms are the same order , @xmath41 the differential rate in this  shape function region \" is therefore sensitive at leading order to the wave function @xmath42 which describes the distribution of the light - cone component of the residual momentum of the @xmath9 quark .",
    "@xmath42 is a nonperturbative function and can not be calculated analytically , so the rate in the region ( [ shapefnregime ] ) is model - dependent even at leading order in @xmath7 .",
    "near the endpoint , the ope for the @xmath43 spectrum has the form ( where @xmath44 ) @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the terms on the first line are all parametrically @xmath47 , and so must be summed to all orders , and the result may be written as a convolution of @xmath42 with the parton - level rate @xcite .",
    "the terms of the second line are less singular near @xmath48 , and so correspond to subleading effects , which will be discussed later .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ threespectra](a - b ) ,        where the lepton energy and hadronic invariant mass spectra are plotted in the parton model ( dashed curves ) and incorporating a simple one - parameter model for the distribution function ( solid curves )  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 the differences between the curves in the regions of interest indicate the sensitivity of the spectrum to the precise form of @xmath51 in both curves , the unshaded side of the vertical line denotes the region free from charm background . because @xmath52 , the integrated rate in this region is very sensitive to the form of @xmath42 , complicating the issue of determining @xmath1 model - independently .      one solution to the problem of sensitivity to nonperturbative effects is to find a set of cuts which eliminate the charm background but do not destroy the convergence of the ope , so that the distribution function @xmath42 is not required . in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out that this is the situation for a cut on the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "decays with @xmath53 must arise from @xmath54 transition .",
    "such a cut forbids the hadronic final state from moving fast in the @xmath0 rest frame , and simultaneously imposes @xmath29 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the light - cone expansion which gives rise to the shape function is not relevant in this region of phase space  @xcite .",
    "the effect of convoluting the @xmath56 spectrum with the model distribution function in eq .",
    "( [ sfn ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ threespectra](c ) .",
    "the region selected by a @xmath56 cut is entirely contained within the @xmath57 cut , but because the dangerous region of high energy , low invariant mass final states is not included , the ope does not break down .",
    "the price to be paid is that the relative size of the unknown @xmath58 terms in the ope grows as the @xmath56 cut is raised .",
    "equivalently , as was stressed in @xcite , the effective expansion parameter for integrated rate inside the region ( [ qsqcutregion ] ) is @xmath59 , not @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the integrated cut rate is very sensitive to @xmath3 , with a @xmath60 error in @xmath3 corresponding to a @xmath61 uncertainty in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a further important source of uncertainty arises from weak annihilation ( wa ) graphs @xcite",
    ". wa arises at @xmath62 in the ope , but is enhanced by a factor of @xmath63 because there are only two particles in the final state compared with @xmath64 . because wa contributes only at the endpoint of the @xmath56 spectrum , it is independent of @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 are matrix elements which are equal for both charged and neutral @xmath0 s under the factorization hypothesis , and so the size of the wa effect depends on the size of factorization violation .",
    "assuming factorization is violated at the @xmath70 level gives a corresponding uncertainty in @xmath1 from a pure @xmath56 cut of @xmath71 @xcite ; however , this estimate is highly uncertain , being proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , since the contribution is fixed at maximal @xmath56 , the corresponding uncertainty grows as the cuts are tightened , reducing the integrated rate .",
    "these uncertainties may be reduced by considering more complicated kinematic cuts : in @xcite it was proposed that by combining cuts on both the leptonic and hadronic invariant masses the theoretical uncertainty on @xmath1 could be minimized . for a fixed cut on @xmath39 ,",
    "lowering the bound on @xmath56 increases the cut rate and decreases the relative size of the @xmath73 terms ( including the wa terms ) , while only introducing a small dependence on @xmath42 .",
    "since this dependence is so weak , a crude measurement of @xmath42 suffices to keep the corresponding theoretical error negligible .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath3 is also reduced .",
    "defining the function @xmath74 by @xmath75 the dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath42 for various cuts is illustrated in fig .",
    "the estimated uncertainty from other sources is given for a variety of cuts in table [ finaltable ] . since the uncertainty in @xmath1 is half that of @xmath74 , we see that , depending on the cuts , theoretical errors at the @xmath76 level are possible .    ) on @xmath74 as a function of @xmath65 for @xmath77 ( solid line ) , @xmath78 ( short dashed line ) and @xmath79 ( long dashed line).,width=264 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ comparetable ]",
    "since differential rates may be computed in the hqe as a power series in @xmath8 and @xmath80 , an unlimited number of spectral moments may be computed .",
    "different moments have different dependence on the nonperturbative parameters of the hqe , so a simultaneous fit to multiple moments allows these parameters to be determined experimentally .",
    "in addition , consistency between different observables provides a powerful check of the validity of the hqe to inclusive decays .",
    "moments which have received particular attention are moments of the charged lepton energy spectrum @xcite and hadronic invariant mass spectrum @xcite in @xmath81 decays , and moments of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath82 decays @xcite .    by comparing the first moment of the photon spectrum in @xmath82 with the first moment of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum , the cleo collaboration @xcite determined @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( where the first error is experimental and the second theoretical ) .",
    "more recently , additional moments have been measured by cleo@xcite , babar @xcite and delphi @xcite , providing enough constraints to perform a global fit to the hqe including terms of order @xmath73 .",
    "two such global fits have been recently performed .",
    "@xcite found @xmath85 while ref .",
    "@xcite found , from just the delphi moments , @xmath86 ( corresponding to @xmath87 gev . ) ref .",
    "@xcite also performed a fit using the pole mass scheme .",
    "matrix elements arising up to @xmath88 in the hqe were also determined from each of the fits .    in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the charm quark mass is determined by the heavy quark relation @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is the spin - averaged meson mass , and @xmath91 and the @xmath92 s are matrix elements of order @xmath93 ) . in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the charm quark is not treated as heavy , and its mass is taken to be a free parameter , to be fit from the moments .",
    "the second approach has the advantage that it does not require an expansion in @xmath94 .",
    "it however has the disadvantage that if the @xmath95 quark is not treated as heavy , a systematic determination of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath96 ( arising at @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively ) from the @xmath99 and @xmath100 mass splittings can no longer be performed .",
    "it is amusing to note that setting experimental errors in the global fit of ref .",
    "@xcite to zero , one obtains the uncertainties @xmath101 , @xmath102 mev , which give an indication of the limiting theoretical uncertainty in the analysis .    one can also use this fit to make precise predictions of other moments as a crosscheck .",
    "bauer and trott @xcite examined fractional moments of the lepton spectrum with a variety of cuts , and found certain moments that were very insensitive to nonperturbative effects .",
    "these moments may therefore be predicted with small uncertainties using the values of @xmath17 and @xmath11 determined from other moments , providing a stringent test of the hqe for inclusive decays .",
    "later , these moments were measured by cleo@xcite , and were found to agree beautifully with the theoretical predictions : @xmath103 ( where  t \" and  e \" denote theory and experiment , respectively ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is currently poor agreement between the hqe and the first hadronic invariant mass moment , measured by babar with different lepton energy cuts , as shown in fig .",
    "[ babarsh ] .",
    "this is a worrisome feature which should be better understood .",
    "one possible resolution is to note that the babar measurement is not completely model independent , but depends on the assumed spectrum of excited @xmath15 resonances . in the model",
    "used , there is no contribution to the @xmath0 semileptonic width from excited @xmath15 states with masses below @xmath104 gev .",
    "this is an assumption which is in conflict with the results of the hqe , as noted a number of years ago by gremm and kapustin @xcite .",
    ", width=264 ]    denoting the lowest excited state as @xmath105 , a lower bound on the first moment of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum may be obtained @xcite by assuming that all rate which does not go to the @xmath15 or @xmath16 goes to the @xmath105 .",
    "this gives the inequality @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the fraction of the semileptonic width which goes to the final state @xmath108 , and the first line gives the first two terms in the hqe .",
    "combining the hqe prediction with the measured ratio of the semileptonic @xmath109 and @xmath110 widths @xcite @xmath111 and taking @xmath112 gev leads to the upper bound @xmath113 which is in conflict with the experimental semileptonic branching fraction to excited states of @xmath114 .",
    "thus , if the prediction for the first moment of the hadronic invariant mass spectrum is valid , a non - negligible fraction of the semileptonic @xmath0 width must be to excited @xmath15 states with @xmath115 gev , which would also bring the babar results in better agreement with theory @xcite . it will be interesting to see how this situation evolves .",
    "the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) has proven very successful at giving a model - independent description of inclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "theory and experiment are now at the stage that a precision determination of @xmath1 is possible from inclusive decays .",
    "the challenge is to incorporate kinematic cuts that exclude @xmath116 decays without introducing large uncertainties ( theoretical or experimental ) .",
    "cutting on the lepton invariant mass @xmath56 or an optimized combination of @xmath56 and the hadronic invariant mass @xmath39 gives a result that is insensitive to the nonperturbative light - cone distribution function @xmath42 , at the expense of a difficult experimental measurement .",
    "cutting on @xmath39 or the energy of the charged lepton @xmath43 is easier experimentally , but introduces dependence on the nonperturbative parton distribution function @xmath42 . at leading order in @xmath117 ,",
    "@xmath42 may be determined from @xmath82 decays , but there are potentially large subleading corrections to this relation ( at least for the cut on @xmath43 ) which may limit the ultimate precision of this method .",
    "spectral moments from semileptonic @xmath116 and radiative @xmath118 decays are now being used to study the hqe at the @xmath88 level , and to determine the values of the hadronic matrix elements which arise in the expansion .",
    "global fits to a variety of moments now allow @xmath119 to be determined with an uncertainty at the @xmath120 level , and a short - distance @xmath3 with an uncertainty at the 100 mev level .",
    "these determinations are not yet limited by theory , and so these determinations are likely to improve in the future .",
