    "investigations of transition metal oxides with metal - insulator transitions in their phase diagrams have revealed a remarkable range of interesting , complex and often unanticipated phenomena , including high temperature superconductivity , various charge , spin and orbital ordered states , triplet superconductivity , giant magnetoelastic effects , and heavy fermion behavior .",
    "a good example is provided by the perovskite manganites .",
    "although known for several decades , these compounds were re - investigated in detail during the last few years because of interest in the colossal magnetoresistive effect , which is basically a metal - insulator transition occurring at or near the magnetic ordering temperature for some compositions .",
    "what has been revealed is a complex phase diagram including charge , spin and orbital ordered phases resulting from an interplay of strong correlations , strong lattice coupling , and band structure effects .    the pyrochlore oxide , cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is metallic at room temperature , but undergoes a metal - insulator transition at 226 k. @xcite upon cooling through the transition , the resistivity , @xmath7 , crosses over from a metallic temperature dependence to an insulating ( @xmath8 strongly increasing as @xmath9 is reduced ) shape , though it does not fit a standard activated form . instead , sleight and co - workers @xcite fit @xmath7 to a form consistent with a second order transition where the gap goes smoothly to zero at the critical temperature .",
    "consistent with this , mandrus and co - workers @xcite report that the specific heat anomaly resembles a mean field transition and shows neither latent heat nor hysteresis .",
    "they also reported extensive crystallographic data , showing very little coupling of the transition to lattice degrees of freedom and confirming the purely electronic character of the transition .",
    "the specific heat shows a very small but possibly still finite sommerfeld coefficient ( note that the reported lattice part does not fit a simple debye model complicating the analysis ) ; @xmath10 mj / mole k@xmath11 in the range 2k to 4k and the low @xmath9 susceptibility is high for an ordered antiferromagnetic insulating phase .",
    "the thermopower above the transition is hole - like and small . just below the transition ,",
    "the thermopower increases to @xmath12 , but then decreases and crosses zero .",
    "a very large electron - like thermopower , up to @xmath13 is seen well below the transition , @xcite this is not expected from the simplest picture of a fully gapped fermi surface due to a spin density wave . on the other hand ,",
    "supposing that the metal - insulator transition is magnetic in character , the ground state could be very complicated especially in view of the strong geometric frustration of the pyrochlore lattice and the fact that the interactions are most likely antiferromagnetic .",
    "the related compound , cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 , which differs from cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 by one electron per transition metal , was recently reported to be superconducting at @xmath141k with a substantial diamagnetic signature .",
    "@xcite it displays metallic properties up to 200k where an apparently isostructural transition of unknown character occurs .",
    "@xcite like cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , this transition shows signatures in electrical transport and susceptibility , though the details differ .",
    "interestingly , the low temperature linear specific heat coefficient for cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath15=30 mj / molk@xmath11 ( ref . )",
    "is similar to the value @xmath16mj / molk@xmath11 estimated for the high temperature phase of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ref . ) in spite of the difference in electron count and the very different low temperature properties .",
    "here we report the electronic structures of these two compounds as calculated within the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method including spin - orbit , which we find important .",
    "@xcite the calculations were done with well converged zone samplings and basis sets ( including local orbitals to relax linearization errors and treat semi - core states ) .",
    "the experimental crystal structure at 180k of mandrus and co - workers , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath17=10.1598  and @xmath18(o1)=0.319 ) was used throughout for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the calculated hellman - feynman force on the symmetry unconstrained structural parameter was found to be small with this choice supporting the experimental crystallography .",
    "total energy minimization , within the lda yields a value @xmath18(o1)=0.3198 .",
    "donohue and co - workers @xcite refined the crystal structure of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 obtaining @xmath17=10.219  and @xmath18(o1)=0.309 . however , this yields rather short re - o bond lengths , and we note that the refinement is difficult because the compound contains heavy elements and the presence of cd mandated the use of x - rays rather than neutrons .",
    "we performed a relaxation of the internal coordinate within the lda keeping the lattice parameter fixed at its no doubt reliable experimental value .",
    "we obtained @xmath18(o1)=0.316 in this way .",
    "the energy of this relaxed structure was 0.35 ev / cell ( 4 re atoms ) lower in energy than with the reported value of @xmath18(o1)=0.309 , which is well outside the normal lda errors .",
    "the raman active @xmath19 phonon frequency corresponding to this coordinate is calculated as 463 @xmath20 . the corresponding frequency for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "also calculated in the lda is almost the same , @xmath21=459 @xmath20 , indicating that the re compound is not softer than the os regardless of the unusual re valence , at least as measured by this particular phonon mode .    in many aspects , the calculations we present are like those presented by mandrus and co - workers for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "however , there is one important difference .",
    "we find that spin orbit interactions are significant because of the presence of heavy elements in the structure , and so include them by the usual second variational approach .",
    "the inclusion of spin - orbit substantially changes the electronic structure near the fermi energy .",
    "in addition , we allow for magnetism in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , which we investigated using self - consistent unconstrained and fixed spin moment calculations .",
    "these were done by the method described in ref .",
    "not surprisingly , our calculated non - spin - polarized band structure for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 _ without including spin orbit _ is practically identical to that given by mandrus and co - workers and so is not displayed here .",
    "significantly , it is very metallic and has four os @xmath22 derived bands crossing the fermi energy @xmath6 and other bands .",
    "it is difficult to envisage what kind of instability might make it insulating . in the remainder of this report",
    "we discuss the band structure _ including spin orbit _ , which while similar in many basic aspects differs significantly near @xmath6 .",
    "the crystal structure of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 features os ions ( nominally os@xmath23 , 5@xmath24 ) at the center of o octahedra .",
    "cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is similar but with one less 5@xmath22 electron per transition metal atom . within an ionic model , assuming nominal charges , one expects a manifold of occupied o @xmath4 bands , followed by a partially filled transition metal @xmath3 manifold and a higher lying unnoccupied set of @xmath5 bands .",
    "furthermore , since the actual transition metal site symmetry is weakly rhombohedral ( due to the second neighbor coordination ) , a further crystal field splitting of the @xmath3 manifold is possible .",
    "the calculated lda band structure of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ldabands ] , while that of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is in fig .",
    "[ re - bands ] .",
    "the corresponding non - spin - polarized densities of states ( dos ) near @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ldados ] and [ re - dos ] .",
    "the gga band structures ( not shown ) are very similar . as shown by the band structure the @xmath3 and @xmath5 manifolds",
    "are cleanly separated from each other , and from the o @xmath4 bands by clean gaps , as in the ionic model . however , despite this there is quite strong hybridization between os @xmath22 and o @xmath25 states , reflecting the covalent tendency of @xmath26 transition metals relative to @xmath27 oxides .",
    "although the actual os site symmetry is rhombohedral , this part of the crystal field is weak and the band structure shows no apparent further splitting of the @xmath3 derived manifold .",
    "it is exactly half - filled and contains 12 bands ( note that there are 4 os ions per unit cell ) .",
    "the @xmath3 band width is 2.85 ev . considering that the effective hubbard @xmath28 is likely 2 ev or less , based on the trends for transition metal oxides , and noting the multichannel character of the @xmath3 manifold , cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 should not be classified as a strongly correlated material in the sense of having on - site coulomb correlations play a dominant role in the formation of the electronic structure .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of a high temperature metallic phase .",
    "@xcite    as mentioned , the @xmath3 manifold , which consists of 12 bands , is exactly half - filled .",
    "unlike the scalar relativisitic band structure , the band structure including spin - orbit shows a semi - metallic structure in the sense that there is a gap between the sixth and seventh bands throughout the brillouin zone , but because of the dispersions it is not an insulating gap . instead , there are two electron - like fermi surfaces .",
    "one , from the lowest conduction band is a shell around the @xmath29 point , while the other consists of ellipsoids along the @xmath29-x lines .",
    "corresponding to these electron surfaces there are hole surfaces at the zone boundary around the w points .",
    "this band structure can , at least conceptually , be made insulating in two ways : ( 1 ) by increasing the gap between the sixth and seventh bands or ( 2 ) by depressing the sixth band at the zone boundary and or raising the , degenerate at @xmath29 , seventh and eighth bands near the zone center .",
    "the heavy masses of these narrow bands is consistent with high thermopowers if a gap is opened . from the band structure",
    ", it may be seen that the electron sheets of fermi surface are lighter ( higher velocity ) than the hole sections . for the paramagnetic metallic state ,",
    "the calculated average fermi velocity is low reflecting these heavy bands , @xmath30 cm / s    the calculated electronic dos , @xmath31 for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 has a large peak just above @xmath6 with @xmath32 ev@xmath33 on a per formula unit ( 2 os atom ) basis .",
    "the gga yields a somewhat higher value @xmath34 ev@xmath33 .",
    "however , while these numbers are smaller than the scalar relativistic value of 12.7 ev@xmath33 reported by mandrus and co - workers , @xcite .",
    "our lda specific heat coefficient @xmath15=22 mj / molk@xmath11 is still consistent within the range of electronic specific heats above the transition as estimated from experiment .",
    "@xcite this leaves little room for enhancement by electron phonon interactions or beyond density functional many body correlations .",
    "the band structure and corresponding dos for cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 are shown in figs .",
    "[ re - bands ] and [ re - dos ] , respectively . as may be seen from the upper panel of fig . [ re - bands ] , the large energy scale electronic structure is like that of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , and in particular the nominal ionic model is valid , with @xmath6 falling in an isolated manifold of transition metal @xmath3 states .",
    "however , a closer examination ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ re - bands ] ) shows that the differences from the os compound are not at all well described by a rigid band model .",
    "the band structure , like that of the os compound is semi - metallic .",
    "in particular , there is a clean pseudogap between the fourth and fifth bands , and since there are eight @xmath22 electrons per cell the nominal fermi energy lies between them the fermi surfaces consist of nearly spherical , moderate mass @xmath29 centered electron pockets from the fifth and sixth bands in the @xmath3 manifold ( @xmath35 ) , and very heavy hole sections from near the zone boundary .",
    "these enclose a total of 0.15 e / cell and an equal number of holes .",
    "as may be seen , this is less symmetric than the situation in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 . however , because of the semi - metallic character , which places @xmath6 near the band edges , the velocity is still rather low , @xmath36 cm / s .",
    "jin and co - workers @xcite report that the hall number is quite @xmath9 dependent , but is electron - like at low temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with our band structure , which has both electron and hole sheets , but with much lighter electron sheets , which will dominate the conductivity due to their higher velocities .",
    "the calculated @xmath37 for cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is 5.3 ev@xmath33 per formula unit , and is derived mainly from the heavy hole bands .",
    "this corresponds to a bare band specific heat @xmath15=12.4 mj / molk@xmath11 .",
    "comparing with the measured value of 29.6 mj / molk@xmath11 ( ref . )",
    "one obtains an enhancement @xmath38 or @xmath39 , a reasonable value for a known superconductor .",
    "the plasma frequency for cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 from the calculated @xmath37 and @xmath40 is @xmath41=1.3ev . within boltzmann tranport theory for conventional metals , the slope of the intrinsic resistivity , in the moderate temperature linear regime ,",
    "is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the transport electron phonon coupling , often a reasonable approximation to the superconducting coupling @xmath44 .",
    "jin and co - workers @xcite report approximately linear @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 from approximately 50 - 200k . however , the two reported samples differ by a factor of more than three in @xmath45 , providing a broad range of @xmath43 from 0.75 to 2.5 .",
    "this is problematic , as according to the experimental data @xmath45 displays unusual though fine structure in this t range , and then changes discontinuously to a value near zero at the transition .",
    "it is extremely hard to imagine such a drastic change in @xmath43 originating from the conventional mechanism , as it would suggest a high temperature phase with almost no electron phonon scattering , which crosses over into a moderate to strong coupled low temperature phase .",
    "the bare susceptibility from the value @xmath37 is @xmath46 emu / mol .",
    "the experimental data show a large spread .",
    "jin and co - workers @xcite estimate @xmath47=5.4@xmath48 emu / mol , while hanawa and co - workers @xcite obtain 3.0 @xmath48 emu / mol at low temperature , rising to @xmath49 emu / mol above the 200k phase transition .",
    "this corresponds to wilson ratios @xmath50 from 0.74 to 1.3 , which are low for a transition metal oxide , but would indicate weak electron correlations in the presence of a moderate electron phonon coupling .",
    "it should be noted that the high value of @xmath51 obtained in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 would lead to a strong magnetic instability in a 3@xmath22 based material , but is marginal here .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the expected lower stoner parameter @xmath52 in a 5@xmath22 compound .",
    "the peak near @xmath6 derives from the flat practically dispersionless band that lies just above @xmath6 over most of the zone .",
    "the relatively high @xmath37 suggests the possibility of a stoner instability against ferromagnetism .",
    "we checked for this both within the lsda and gga using fixed spin moment calculations , but found that cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is predicted to be stable against ferromagnetism , so there is not such an instability .",
    "the calculated susceptibility is @xmath53 emu / g in the lsda .",
    "this was determined from a fourth order fit of the energy _ vs. _ moment for the small moment part of fig .",
    "the bare pauli susceptibility from @xmath37 is @xmath54 emu / g , which yields a stoner enhancement of @xmath55 .",
    "the gga , which sometimes overestimates the tendency towards magnetism in 4@xmath22 and 5@xmath22 oxides , places cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 closer to a magnetic instability , with @xmath56 emu / g and @xmath57 . taking into account the difference in the lda and gga values of @xmath37 ,",
    "the gga value of the effective stoner @xmath52 is 50% higher than the corresponding lda value .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath58 , where lsda calculations correctly produce a paramagnetic state , while the gga produces an incorrect ferromagnetic ground state , @xcite due to an overestimated @xmath52 . in any case ,",
    "stoner ferromagnetism would rigidly exchange split the band structure , at least for small moments ; as can be seen from the band structure , this would not result in an insulating electronic structure .",
    "the band structure is quite isotropic ( note _ e.g. _ the similar dispersions around @xmath6 along @xmath29-x and @xmath29-l in fig .",
    "[ ldabands ] ) and does not display strong nesting . thus there is no obvious preferred wavevector to check in searching for a magnetic instability .",
    "however , noting that there are four os atoms in the unit cell , we checked for a @xmath29 point antiferromagnetic instability , in which two of the four os atoms are spin up and two are spin down . in principle , a state like this could produce an insulating band structure .",
    "this is because the site dependent on - site exchange splittings reduce hopping between opposite spin os atoms , thus potentially narrowing the bands enough to open the pseudogap between the sixth and seventh bands producing a full band gap . while we find that cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is unstable against such an antiferromagnetic ordering in the gga without spin orbit , we find that spin - orbit favors the paramagnetic state . in the lsda an antiferromagnetic ordering of this type does not occur . within the gga ,",
    "including spin - orbit , we find that the material is on the borderline of an instability against this antiferromagnetic order",
    ". the resulting antiferromagnetic state , with spin moments of @xmath59 0.3 @xmath60/os , has the same energy as the paramagnetic state to within the precision of our calculations .",
    "furthermore , with this size of moments , the band narrowing is insufficient to destroy the metallic state .",
    "the os sublattice consists of corner sharing tetrahedra , with the os atoms at the corners . as a result",
    "it is not possible to find a structure in which all nearest neighbor os bonds are antiferromagnetic , and additionally , the lattice is strongly geometrically frustrated for nearest neighbor spin hamiltonians .",
    "however , based on our band structure results , the proximity of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 to magnetism is itinerant in nature , and therefore can not be described in terms of simple nearest neighbor spin hamiltonians .",
    "in fact , the experimental low thermodynamic data do not show any evidence of a large near ground state degeneracy .",
    "however , it is still the case that the simple collinear antiferromagnetic state we considered is favored relative to a ferromagnetic state , and so one may speculate that more complicated arrangements that would better fulfill a tendency for antiferromagnetic neighbors may be lower in energy . in particular , even though small moment itinerant magnets are generally collinear , as may be understood from arguments based on band kinetic energy considerations , here for want of a better alternative , one might postulate that a non - collinear ground state may occur .",
    "one example of such a state would be an arrangement in which the os moments are directed either towards or away from the center of the tetrahedra .",
    "such a state could be at the @xmath29 point or could have the character of a spin density wave , with modulation at a non - zero wavevector .",
    "each os atom has two like spin and four opposite spin neighbors , in the simple antiferromagnetic configuration we calculated . on the pyrochlore lattice , this leaves a fully connected 3d network of like spin nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "one may speculate that a more complex arrangement that disrupts this fully connected network ( as the non - collinear arrangement mentioned above would do ) would narrow the bands enough to produce an insulating state .",
    "it is unclear whether such a state would be energetically favored here .",
    "however , the fact that we find the simple collinear antiferromagnetic state to be at least marginally stable in the gga and favored with respect to ferromagnetism , may suggest that it is at least possible . in an itinerant magnetic state ,",
    "like the one discussed above , the magnetic interactions in real space are inherently long range , so depression of the ordering temperature , @xmath61 due to geometric frustration is not to be expected . still we emphasize that this scenario is not well supported by the current results for three reasons : ( 1 ) it is unclear that a purely magnetic instability exists in the lsda , which may be a better approximation than the gga for 5@xmath22 compounds .",
    "an alternate scenario is a transition involving both charge and spin ordering , though there is not presently evidence for a charge density wave in the experimental data ; ( 2 ) non - collinear states , as mentioned , are generally not found or expected in itinerant low moment magnets ; and finally ( 3 ) even if the system has magnetic instabilities it is unclear that they could be strong enough to produce a transition temperature above 200k .",
    "band structure calculations for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 and cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 show a considerable sensitivity of the electronic structure near @xmath6 to spin orbit interactions .",
    "both materials show semi - metallic band structures with heavy bands near @xmath6 .",
    "cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 has heavy hole bands near the zone boundary and relatively light electron pockets around @xmath29 , while the electronic structure of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is dominated by heavy bands for both the holes and electrons .",
    "interestingly , because of the higher @xmath37 in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , the transport function , @xmath62 differs by only 7@xmath63 .",
    "however , the specific heat enhancement in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is apparently quite small , while that in cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is 2.4 , leaving little room for electron - phonon interactions or simple many electron effects in the former .",
    "furthermore , while cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is at least near antiferromagnetism in the gga , neither compound shows a clear proximity to magnetism in the lsda , which may be a more reasonable approximation for 5@xmath22 compounds .",
    "there are no clear nesting features in the band structures that would suggest spin or charge density wave fermi surface instabilities .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the metal - insulator transition in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 and the 200k transition in cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 are related to some common feature in their electronic structures . in this regard",
    ", we note that although they have different electron counts , both compounds have semimetallic band structures each with nominally equal numbers of holes and electrons dominated by very heavy bands .",
    "this is suggestive of a excitonic instability of the fermi surface of the type proposed by mott @xcite and reviewed by halperin and rice .",
    "@xcite the theory in its simplest form involves pairing between electrons on one sheet of fermi surface and holes on another .",
    "conditions that favor such a state are ( 1 ) heavy band masses ( 2 ) low carrier densities and ( 3 ) similar sizes and shapes of fermi surfaces , although the latter condition can sometimes be relaxed as discussed in ref . . such an instability is purely electronic , and in contrast to",
    "_ e.g. _ a charge density wave need not be coupled significantly to lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the excitonic state may be either singlet , or triplet .",
    "furthermore it can coexist with superconductivity @xcite or band ferromagnetism , @xcite provided that there are excess carriers .",
    "while such a transition is due to electron correlations , it is not associated with an on - site hubbard - like coulomb repulsion , but rather * k * dependent correlations near @xmath6 .",
    "importantly , the formation of an excitonic state involves weak thermodynamic signatures ( it involves electrons only within a distance determined by the exciton binding energy from @xmath6 ) and is continuous .",
    "the general phenomenology of an excitonic metal insulator transition would seem to fit experimental knowledge and the above band structure results for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , especially for triplet pairing .",
    "@xcite the key parameters determining whether such a state can be formed are the exciton binding energy and the degree to which the size and shape of the electron and hole fermi surfaces match in * k * as compared to the inverse size of an exciton .",
    "we can not assess these as we do have the effective dielectric screening .",
    "however , we note that the very heavy bands should help to produce small excitons and favor this possibility .",
    "the situation in cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is similar .",
    "however , in this material the 200k transition is between two metallic states . within the excitonic scenario the metallic conduction below 200k and",
    "the superconductivity depend on the existence of non - paired carriers below the transition .",
    "these could be provided by _",
    "e.g. _ slight off - stoichiometry , which may perhaps be anticipated from the unusual re valence .",
    "this doping could be sample dependent providing an explanation of the very different @xmath45 and the different @xmath64 of the two reported samples discussed above .",
    "we emphasize that the above discussion of excitonic states in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 and cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is speculative .",
    "however , if it is so , these materials will be interesting novel tests of many body theories of excitonic phases , including superconductivity , possible triplet pairing and the presence of strong spin - orbit interactions .",
