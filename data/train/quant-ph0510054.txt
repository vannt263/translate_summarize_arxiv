    "both the casimir and van der waals interactions are the quantum phenomena caused by fluctuating electromagnetic fields . in the framework of quantum field theory ,",
    "these interactions can be described through the alteration by the material boundaries of the zero - point electromagnetic energy that pervades all of space .",
    "thus , the casimir and van der waals forces are found to be closely connected with the fundamental properties of quantum vacuum ( see the original ref .",
    "@xcite and monographs @xcite ) .    in the last few years",
    "the casimir interaction has been actively investigated in connection with topical applications in extra - dimensional physics ( where it provides an effective mechanism for spontaneous compactification of extra spatial dimensions ) and in the bag model of hadrons @xcite .",
    "several measurements of the casimir and van der waals forces between metal macrobodies were performed with increased precision using modern laboratory techniques @xcite .",
    "the experimental results were used to obtain stronger constraints on the yukawa - type long - range interaction , predicted by many extensions to the standard model , in the micrometer interaction range @xcite .",
    "concurrent with the fundamental applications in elementary particle physics , the use of the casimir and van der waals forces in nanotechnology @xcite , in quantum reflection and bose - einstein condensation @xcite and in noncontact atomic friction @xcite was begun .",
    "the numerous applications of the casimir and van der waals forces and the extensive experimental work impose severe demands on the accuracy of theoretical predictions .",
    "the basic theory of these forces acting between real materials was developed by e.  m.  lifshitz and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "it expresses the free energy and force acting between two macrobodies in terms of their frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities .",
    "the original derivation of the lifshitz formulas for the free energy and pressure between two thick dielectric plates is based on the concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field and uses the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "if the temperature of plates is not equal to zero , this concept includes both zero - point oscillations and thermal fluctuations of the field .",
    "in general , the lifshitz derivation is applicable to both transparent and absorbing media . at present time , there are derivations of the lifshitz formula based on the thermal quantum field theory in the matsubara formulation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "they do not employ the fluctuation - dissipation theorem but lead to results identical to those obtained with the use of this theorem .",
    "thermal quantum field theory is immediately applicable to only transparent bodies , but , under certain conditions , dissipation can also be included .    quite independently from the lifshitz formula , the matsubara thermal quantum field theory was applied @xcite for the investigation of the casimir force acting between two plane parallel plates made of ideal metal ( at zero temperature this case was considered already in ref .",
    "this is an exactly solvable problem of field quantization with the dirichlet boundary conditions on the surface of the plates for the tangential component of electric field and with the identification condition in the euclidean time variable .",
    "the obtained analytic expressions for the casimir pressure , free energy and entropy were found to be in perfect agreement with thermodynamics . in particular , the magnitudes of the free energy and pressure were found to be monotonously increasing functions with the increase of the temperature .",
    "entropy is nonnegative and goes to zero when temperature vanishes ; this is in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) @xcite .",
    "for the first time , the lifshitz formula was considered to be in contradiction with the quantum field theoretical approach to the case of ideal metals since it leads to a different result in the limit of infinitely large dielectric permittivity .",
    "the situation was clarified by the so called schwinger s prescription @xcite whereby the limit of infinite dielectric permittivity in the lifshitz formula must be taken prior to putting the matsubara frequency equal to zero . once that prescription is followed , the results obtained for ideal metals from the lifshitz formula match those obtained from thermal quantum field theory with the dirichlet boundary conditions",
    ".    currently the lifshitz formula leads to problems when applied to the case of two plates made of real metals at nonzero temperature . in refs .",
    "@xcite metallic plates were characterized with the dielectric permittivity of the drude model . in the limit of ideal metals",
    "this approach comes into conflict with the values of the casimir free energy and pressure obtained using thermal quantum field theory with the dirichlet boundary conditions . as was also proved in refs .",
    "@xcite , the substitution of the drude dielectric function in the lifshitz formula leads to a violation of the third law of thermodynamics in the case of perfect crystal lattice with no defects and impurities ( as discussed above , the quantum field theory approach obeys this law in the case of ideal metals ) .    another way to describe the realistic properties of a metal is to use the dielectric permittivity of the free electron plasma model @xcite or to impose the surface - impedance boundary conditions @xcite . in the case of ideal metals , both these approaches",

    "the consistency of the lifshitz theory with thermal quantum field theory is not completely understood , and , on the other hand , the agreement of the lifshitz theory with thermodynamics is called into question .",
    "an important point is that some thermodynamic aspects of the lifshitz theory are still unknown even in the case of two dielectric plates for which consensus in the literature is achieved .",
    "one of the major problems realized 50 years back , but not resolved up to the present , is the elucidation of the low - temperature behavior of the casimir ( van der waals ) free energy , pressure and entropy between two dielectric plates . without a resolution of this fundamental issue it would be impossible to settle the more complicated problems related to real metals .",
    "even the correct way of practical computations for comparison of experimental results with theory would be uncertain .    in the present paper",
    "we reconsider the thermal van der waals and casimir interactions between two thick dissimilar dielectric plates .",
    "we start with a brief analysis of two derivations of the lifshitz formula in the framework of thermal quantum field theory in the matsubara formulation .",
    "special attention is paid to the conditions under which the quantum field theoretical derivations are applicable not only to transparent media but also to media with dissipation .",
    "we next consider the casimir effect between two plates made of dissimilar dilute dielectrics with constant dielectric permittivities @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . in this case",
    "it is possible to develop the perturbation theory in the small parameters @xmath2 and to obtain the explicit analytic expressions for the casimir free energy and pressure which are exact in the separation between the plates and their temperature .",
    "the simple asymptotic behavior of the free energy , pressure and entropy at both low and high temperatures ( short and large separations , respectively ) is also found .",
    "the leading terms of the casimir entropy at low temperature are shown to be of the second and third power in temperature , thus , demonstrating the agreement of the lifshitz formula with thermodynamics in the case of dilute dielectrics .    as a next step ,",
    "we derive analytically the low - temperature behavior of the casimir and van der waals forces between dissimilar dielectrics using the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities . for this purpose ,",
    "perturbation theory in a small parameter which is proportional to the product of the separation distance between the plates and their temperature is developed .",
    "it is proved that the thermal corrections to the van der waals and casimir energy and pressure have an universal form and their asymptotic behavior can be calculated in terms of the static dielectric permittivities of the plate materials . once again",
    ", the leading contributions to the entropy are shown to be of the second and third power in temprature which proves the agreement of the lifshitz formula with thermodynamics in the case of dielectric plates with finite static dielectric permittivities . in the limit",
    "@xmath3 the above results for dilute dielectrics are again obtained .",
    "results for the special case of similar dielectrics are also provided .",
    "this means that the long - standing problem on the low - temperature properties of the lifshitz theory in the case of dielectric plates is resolved .    in what follows",
    "we perform the comparison between the obtained analytic results and numerical computations for dielectric plates made of silicon and vitreous silica .",
    "the cases of both dissimilar and similar plates are considered .",
    "the dielectric permittivities of silicon and vitreous silica along the imaginary frequency axis are found by means of the dispersion relation using the tabulated optical data for both materials . in all cases the excellent agreement between the analytic and numerical results is observed below some definite temperature ( separation ) values .",

    "@xcite use the lifshitz - type formula and describe the dielectric permittivity of the dielectric substrate by means of the drude model with appropriately low conductivity .",
    "formally , this leads to infinitely high permittivity of a dielectric at zero frequency and to the modification of the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula .",
    "we demonstrate that such a modification results in the violation of the nernst heat theorem .",
    "hence , it follows that the dc conductivity of dielectrics is irrelevant to the van der waals and casimir forces and must not be included in the model of dielectric response . this conclusion leads to important consequences for both the problem of atomic friction and for the casimir and van der waals interactions between real metals .",
