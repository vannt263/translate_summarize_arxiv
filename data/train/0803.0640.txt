    "culler - vogtmann space , or outer space as it is sometimes called , has been the subject of intense study .",
    "much of the direction of this work has been to develop a theory for outer space , and the outer automorphism group of a free group in an analogous way to the theory of teichmller space and the mapping class group of a surface .",
    "our contribution to this effort is the study of a metric which is a clear analogue of the teichmller metric , with the goal that the important features of both outer space , and the automorphisms of a free group are captured by the geometry of this metric .    after recalling the basic definitions in section  [ prel ]",
    ", we spend some in section  [ calculating ] time defining and understanding the `` one - sided '' metric , from which our metric is obtained by a `` symmetrisation '' .",
    "in fact , a special case of this one - sided metric ( where the objects are a rose , and its image under an automorphism ) is a quantity that has appeared in the work of kapovich , @xcite , where it is shown that the value is computable in double exponential time . as part of our efforts to understand our metric , and simplify many of the proofs of its properties , we show that the calculation is considerably simpler , proposition  [ glasses ] , so that the calculation for a rose is actually linear .",
    "we then study the metric itself in section  [ metrics ] , and show that the metric topology is the same as the usual length function topology , as well as showing that the metric is proper ; closed balls are compact in this space .",
    "this is one advantage the symmetric version of the metric has over the unsymmetric version , since for the one - sided metric not only are cauchy sequences not always convergent , but also points which _ should _ be at infinite distance , namely points on the boundary of outer space , are actually at finite distance from points in the interior of outer space .    section  [ s5 ] is concerned with the connection between the geometry of outer space and the properties of the automorphisms of a free group . specifically , we study the behaviour of `` folding paths '' and their metric properties .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to show that these paths are geodesics for the one - sided metric , but it seems to be much more difficult to show that they are even quasi - geodesics for the actual metric .",
    "however , these folding paths are shown to have good properties , such as the `` 4 point property '' , defined in theorem  [ t4pp ] .    in section  [ s66 ]",
    "we show with an example that outer space , equipped with the symmetric metric , is not a geodesic space .",
    "we want to stress here that such example was suggested to the authors by bert wiest and thierry coulbois when a previous version of this paper was posted on the arxiv .    in section  [ qg ]",
    ", we show that if folding paths remain within the `` thick part '' of outer space , then they will be quasi - geodesics which is a result , definitions aside , that it very intuitive .",
    "we finish , in section  [ iterate ] by showing that for an automorphism of exponential growth , the map from @xmath0 to outer space which sends an integer , @xmath1 to the @xmath2 iterate of a given point under the automorphism is a quasi - isometry .",
    "interestingly , while this result is clearly false for automorphisms of polynomial growth , we show that for a particular example of polynomial growth automorphism , the folding path between the rose and a image of the rose under an ( arbitrary ) iterate of the automorphism is a quasi - geodesic with uniform constants .",

    "our basic objects are finite marked metric graphs of some given rank @xmath1 .",
    "a graph of this type is represented as a metric graph , @xmath3 - that is , with a positive length assigned to every edge - and a marking @xmath4 which is a homotopy equivalence from the rose with @xmath1 petals , @xmath5 to a , @xmath6    we shall make the standard assumption that vertices have valence at least three .",
    "nonetheless , we notice that it is sometimes convenient to allow vertices of valence two .",
    "when it is clear from the contest , we will not specify whether we use bi - valent vertices .",
    "two marked graphs @xmath3 and @xmath7 are equivalent if there is a homothety , @xmath8 , such that the following diagram commutes up to free homotopy ,    @xmath9^h &   &   b   \\\\   & r_n \\ar[ul]^{\\tau_a } \\ar[ur]_{\\tau_b } \\\\   } \\ ] ]    alternatively , we could only consider metric graphs of volume 1 and then the equivalence would be given by isometries in place of homotheties . in either case , the resulting space of equivalence classes is called culler - vogtmann space of rank @xmath1 , or @xmath10 ( when bi - valent vertices are allowed , two marked graphs are also equivalent if they have a common finite subdivision . )    in the following , if there are no ambiguities we will not distinguish between a marked metric graph and its class .    when we will need to be precise",
    "we will refer to a metric graph as an element of the unprojectivised @xmath10 , and to its class as an element of @xmath10 .",
    "given any marked graph @xmath3 , we can look at the universal cover @xmath11 which is an @xmath12-tree on which @xmath13 acts by isometries , via the marking @xmath4 .",
    "( from now on , we identify the free group of rank @xmath1 , @xmath14 , with the fundamental group of @xmath5 . )",
    "conversely , given any minimal free action of @xmath14 by isometries on a simplicial @xmath12-tree , we can look at the quotient object , which will be a graph , @xmath3 , and produce a homotopy equivalence @xmath15 via the action .",
    "equivalence of graphs in @xmath10 corresponds to actions which are equivalent up to equivariant homothety .",
    "thus , points in @xmath10 , can be thought of as equivalence classes minimal free isometric actions on simplicial @xmath12-trees . given an element @xmath16 of @xmath14 and a point @xmath3 of the unprojectivised @xmath10 , with universal cover @xmath11 whose metric we denote by @xmath17 , we may consider , @xmath18    it is well known that this infimum is always obtained and that , for a free action , it is non - zero for the non - identity elements of the group . in this context , @xmath19 is called the translation length of the element @xmath16 in the corresponding tree and clearly depends only on the conjugacy class of @xmath16 in @xmath14 .",
    "thus for any point , @xmath3 , in @xmath10 we can associate the sequence @xmath20 and it is clear that equivalent marked metric graphs will produce two sequences , one of which is a multiple of the other by a positive real number ( the homothety constant . )",
    "moreover , it is also the case that inequivalent points in @xmath10 will produce sequences which are not multiples of each other @xcite",
    ". thus , we have an embedding of @xmath10 into @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the equivalence relation of homothety .",
    "the space @xmath10 is given the subspace topology induced by this embedding .    finally it is clear we can realise any automorphism , @xmath23 , of @xmath14 as a homotopy equivalence , also called @xmath23 , of @xmath5 .",
    "thus the automorphism group of @xmath14 acts on @xmath10 by changing the marking . that is , given a point @xmath24 of @xmath10 the image of this point under @xmath23 is @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26^{\\phi } \\ar@/^2pc/[rr]|{\\tau_a \\phi } & r_n \\ar[r]^{\\tau_a } & a.   \\\\   } \\ ] ]    since two automorphisms which differ by an inner automorphism always send equivalent points in @xmath10 to equivalent points , we actually have an action of @xmath27 on @xmath10 , and this space is often called _ outer space _ for this reason .",
    "given two marked metric graphs , @xmath3 and @xmath7 with fundamental group free of rank @xmath1 , we would like to compute the distance between them and , as a first step , the `` right hand distance '' between them , defined as follows .",
    "[ rightdist ] for any pair @xmath28 of marked graphs we set @xmath29    recall that @xmath19 is the translation length of the element corresponding to @xmath16 in the tree @xmath11 ( and hence is dependent only on the conjugacy class of @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , it is readily seen that this translation length is the same as the length of the shortest representative in the free homotopy class of loops in @xmath3 defined by the ( conjugacy class of ) @xmath16 .",
    "we note that this second definition means that @xmath19 is easy to compute given a particular @xmath16 : we look at the image of @xmath16 in @xmath3 via the marking and we `` cyclically reduce '' the loop in the graph by performing free cyclic reductions which may , of course , change the basepoint",
    ". the length of any cyclically reduced element in this sense , calculated simply by summing the lengths of the edges crossed , will be @xmath19 .",
    "we shall also use @xmath30 to refer to the lengths of ( free homotopy classes of ) loops in @xmath3 in the obvious way .",
    "we also note that saying a loop in @xmath3 is cyclically reduced is equivalent to saying that , if we consider the loop as a map from the circle to the graph it is an immersion . in the same spirit , a path is reduced if it is an immersion when considered as a map from a closed interval .",
    "while finding lengths of elements with respect to a marked metric graph structure is straightforward , that does not indicate how to calculate the supremum given above . in order to do that ,",
    "we need to relate one structure to the other . one way to do this is to find an equivariant map from @xmath3 to @xmath7 , which we can simply think of as a homotopy equivalence between the graphs , which respects the markings .",
    "that is , a map @xmath31 for which the following triangle commutes up to free homotopy ,    @xmath9^f &   &   b   \\\\   & r_n \\ar[ul]^{\\tau_a } \\ar[ur]_{\\tau_b } \\\\   } \\ ] ]    in other words , @xmath31 is a map homotopic to @xmath32 followed by @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that this is not a graph map in that edges are not necessarily sent to edges nor vertices to vertices . we will therefore restrict to a particular class of maps that are more easy to handle .",
    "a map @xmath35 is a @xmath36-map if it is linear on edges .",
    "more precisely , for each edge @xmath37 of @xmath3 , if we parameterise @xmath38 with the segment @xmath39 $ ] , then @xmath38 has constant speed .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the speed of @xmath38 ( the stretching factor of @xmath37 . )    the stretching factor of a pl - map @xmath31 , defined as the maximal speed of @xmath31 , is in fact the lipschitz constant of @xmath31 .",
    "we denote that quantity by @xmath41 ( the notation @xmath42 for the lipschitz constant is more natural but also more confusing since we already have lengths denoted by the letter @xmath43 )    @xmath44    in general , given @xmath31 , there is a unique pl - map @xmath45 which is homotopic to @xmath31 and agrees with @xmath31 on vertices .",
    "it is readily checked that @xmath46    a useful observation one can make here is that @xmath47 serves as an upper bound for @xmath48 .",
    "this is because , starting with a loop @xmath49 in @xmath3 , it is clear that @xmath50 since we can consider all loops which are cyclically reduced in @xmath3 this means that , @xmath51 and we hence proved    [ l_lip ] for any lipschitz map @xmath35 in the homotopy class of @xmath52 @xmath53    since @xmath31 is arbitrary , and because of  @xmath54 , we can deduce that @xmath55    it is fairly clear that the infimum on the right hand side of equation  [ stretch ] will be realised by an actual map .",
    "[ lstretch ] [ min ] let @xmath28 two marked metric graphs .",
    "then there exists an @xmath56 such that @xmath57    for any @xmath58 , the set of @xmath58-lipschitz maps from @xmath3 to @xmath7 is precompact by ascoli - arzel theorem because @xmath7 is compact .",
    "therefore a sequence of maps @xmath59 , whose stretching factors tend to the infimum has a convergent sub - sequence whose limit is @xmath60 , and it is easily checked that @xmath61 .",
    "previous lemma holds in a more general setting of spaces of length functions ( e.g. actions on real trees . )    equations  [ lip ] and  [ stretch ] , and lemma  [ lstretch ] tell us that from now on we can , as we do , assume that any map is a pl .",
    "now note that there are two obstructions to making equation  [ stretch ] an equality .",
    "while we may realise the infimum by a concrete map , @xmath31 , we may still have that for a given loop @xmath49 , not all edges of @xmath49 may be stretched by the same amount @xmath41 .",
    "thus we need the collection of edges which are stretched maximally to be large enough as to contain a loop .",
    "furthermore , even if we have such a loop @xmath49 , the image @xmath62 may not be cyclically reduced in @xmath7 . however ,",
    "if we have a cyclically reduced loop , @xmath49 , in @xmath3 , all of whose edges are stretched by @xmath41 and such that @xmath62 is cyclically reduced in @xmath7 , then @xmath63 .",
    "it will turn out that there always exists a map @xmath31 and a loop @xmath49 with these properties . before going into details , we need some preliminaries .",
    "let @xmath28 be marked metric graphs of rank @xmath1 . given a pl - map @xmath34 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath64 the subgraph of @xmath3 whose edges are stretched maximally , by @xmath41 .",
    "a pl - map @xmath34 is not optimal if there is some vertex of @xmath64 such that all edges of @xmath64 terminating at that vertex have @xmath31-image with a common terminal partial edge .",
    "otherwise @xmath31 is optimal .    using the terminology of legal and illegal turns ,",
    "a pl - map is optimal if each vertex of @xmath65 has at least one legal turn .",
    "suppose that a map @xmath66 is not optimal .",
    "let @xmath67 be a vertex of @xmath64 such that all edges of @xmath64 terminating at @xmath67 have @xmath31-image with a common terminal partial edge , say @xmath68 .",
    "let star@xmath69 denote the set of edge emanating from @xmath67 .",
    "we set @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "now , let @xmath72 be the homotopy that moves @xmath67 backward along @xmath68 . more precisely , we let @xmath73\\to b$ ] be the homotopy such that @xmath74 is the pl - map that agrees with @xmath31 outside star@xmath69 and such that @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "such a homotopy exists for small @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , for small @xmath77 we have :    1 .   for any @xmath78 and any @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "either @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( but not equal . )",
    "* or @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the supremum of times @xmath77 such that @xmath72 exists and has the above properties .",
    "we define @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "note that @xmath86 can be defined only for non - optimal maps .",
    "we can now prove that the inequality  [ stretch ] is an equality , as was first proved by tad white .",
    "[ p_optimal ] [ equal ]",
    "let @xmath28 be marked metric graphs of rank @xmath1 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath66 and a cyclically reduced loop @xmath49 contained in @xmath65 , the subgraph of maximally stretched edges of @xmath3 , whose @xmath31-image is also cyclically reduced . in particular , @xmath63 for this map @xmath31 .    by lemma  [ min ] , we may choose a map @xmath31 whose stretching factor is minimal .",
    "moreover , we may choose such a map with the least number of edges in @xmath64 .",
    "hence , @xmath86 can not exist , and therefore @xmath31 is optimal .",
    "this means that any path , @xmath88 , in @xmath64 which is mapped to a reduced path by @xmath31 can be continued to a longer path , which is also mapped to something reduced .",
    "this is because the obstruction to continuing @xmath88 is exactly non - optimality of @xmath31 . starting with a single edge , and",
    "since there are only finitely many oriented edges in @xmath64 , we can find a reduced path of the form @xmath89 which is mapped to a reduced path by @xmath31 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath90 is a cyclically reduced loop , which is mapped to something cyclically reduced .",
    "moreover , @xmath91 , and hence @xmath63 as required .    actually , one can do better .",
    "let @xmath35 be a pl - map .",
    "for any sub - graph @xmath92 of @xmath3 , we define @xmath93 the @xmath31-boundary of @xmath92 as the set of vertices @xmath67 of @xmath92 such that all edges of @xmath92 terminating at @xmath67 have @xmath31-image with a common terminal partial edge .",
    "so , for example , a map is optimal if and only if @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath28 be marked metric graphs of rank @xmath1 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath66 such that , if @xmath95 are the stretching factors of edges , if @xmath96 denotes the sub - graph of edges stretched by @xmath97 , then for all @xmath98 @xmath99 ( so , heuristically , @xmath96 is a cycle relative to @xmath100 . )",
    "once one founds optimal maps as in proposition  [ equal ] , choose between them one that has the smallest @xmath101 and @xmath102 , argue as in proposition  [ equal ] , and conclude inductively on @xmath98 .",
    "we note that implicit in the proof of proposition  [ equal ] is a proof that @xmath48 is computable .",
    "namely , the path @xmath49 produced at the end of the proof can be chosen minimally , and so we may assume that it passes through each oriented edge at most once .",
    "there are only finitely many such paths , and we may compute their lengths in @xmath3 and @xmath7 ( without reference to @xmath31 ) as well as the maximum of the ratio of these lengths .",
    "by the proposition , this maximum will be exactly @xmath48 .",
    "however , the number of such @xmath49 will be exponential in the number of edges .",
    "we will now show that it is always possible to find a `` less complicated '' loop @xmath49 , which will cut down the computational complexity considerably .",
    "we will approach this problem in two steps , and the idea of this result is that we want to reduce the complexity of @xmath49 as a loop in @xmath3 .",
    "we always have in mind an optimal map @xmath31 , and so we will assume that @xmath49 lies in @xmath65",
    ". we shall attempt to simplify by cutting and gluing @xmath49 to itself .",
    "since we will only use edges that were already in @xmath49 , we ensure that our loops are always contained in @xmath65 . in order for the cutting and pasting to result in loops which still give the value for @xmath48",
    ", we need to make sure that the resulting image in @xmath7 is cyclically reduced .",
    "therefore we always need to keep in mind that we are working at two levels .",
    "on the one hand we have a loop , @xmath49 , thought of as a map from the circle to @xmath3 ( @xmath65 , in fact ) .",
    "we then compose this map with @xmath31 and the resulting loop in @xmath7 is an immersion .",
    "for the first step of our result , we prove the following `` sausages lemma '' , which says that we may take a @xmath49 which realises @xmath48 and whose shape in @xmath3 has in figure  [ sausage picture ] .       for any oriented path @xmath49",
    "we denote by @xmath103 its inverse .",
    "[ sausages ] let @xmath28 be marked metric graphs of rank @xmath1 , and let @xmath104 be an optimal map .",
    "then there exists a loop @xmath49 such that @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , @xmath49 is cyclically reduced in @xmath3 and in @xmath7 via @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath49 is a sausage , i.e. @xmath106 where each @xmath107 is a path in @xmath3 that can be parameterised with @xmath108 $ ] in such a way that    * @xmath109 and @xmath110 are embeddings ; * there exists a finite family of disjoint closed intervals @xmath111 , each one possibly consisting of a single point , such that @xmath112 if and only if @xmath113 and @xmath77 belongs to @xmath114 .",
    "the content of the result is that @xmath115 with the specified properties , since everything else follows from proposition  [ equal ] .",
    "this will follow from two sublemmas .",
    "first we establish some notation .",
    "we shall think of @xmath49 as a map from @xmath116 to @xmath3 and also , via @xmath31 , as a map from @xmath116 to @xmath7 .",
    "we shall subdivide @xmath116 to give it a graph structure and so that edges map to edges in @xmath7 .",
    "for simplicity , although it is nt really necessary , we shall assume that all the vertices of @xmath3 map to vertices of @xmath7 , which we can arrange after a suitable subdivision .",
    "our first sublemma says that if three distinct points in @xmath116 have the same image in @xmath3 , then we can choose @xmath49 to be shorter ( in both @xmath3 and @xmath7 . ) to do this , we look at three points in @xmath116 mapped to the same point in @xmath3",
    ". thus we decompose @xmath49 as @xmath117 as in the picture above , where the endpoints of each @xmath118 map to the same point in @xmath3 .",
    "our first attempt is to try to replace @xmath49 with one of the @xmath118 , each of which is clearly a shorter path in @xmath3 , and each of which maps to a reduced path in @xmath7 .",
    "the only way that this can fail is if each @xmath118 maps to a reduced but not cyclically reduced path in @xmath7 .",
    "this means that we can write , @xmath119 where we are writing each @xmath118 as a concatenation of edges _ labelled _ by the image of that edge in @xmath7 .",
    "thus we are saying that the image of @xmath120 in @xmath7 begins with an edge @xmath121 and ends with the inverse edge @xmath122 .",
    "however , we know that @xmath49 is immersed in @xmath7 , so that @xmath123 . in particular , this implies that the loop @xmath124 is immersed in @xmath7 , and we are done .",
    "for the second sublemma , we will show that we can avoid crossing double points in @xmath49 .",
    "that is , if we can write @xmath49 as a concatenation @xmath125 in @xmath116 such that the initial points of @xmath120 and @xmath126 have the same image in @xmath3 , and the initial points of @xmath127 and @xmath128 have the same image in @xmath3 , then we may replace @xmath49 by a shorter path ( shorter in both @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "now we try to replace @xmath49 by one of the paths @xmath129 ( subscripts taken modulo 4 ) . if any of these map to cyclically reduced loops in @xmath7 , we are done .",
    "otherwise , we get that , @xmath130 where , as before , this is a concatenation of edges in @xmath116 labelled by the images in @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that @xmath131 with subscripts taken mod 4 .",
    "since we know that @xmath49 is immersed in @xmath7 , we must have that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "thus it is clear that the loop @xmath134 is immersed in @xmath7 , and hence we have proven the second sublemma .    for our third and final sublemma",
    ", we wish to remove all `` bad triangles ''",
    ". this may be slightly confusing terminology , but we wish to avoid the situation where @xmath49 is the concatenation of 6 paths , where alternating paths in this decomposition are closed ( and the other 3 form a , not necessarily embedded , triangle ) .",
    "formally , let us assume that we can write @xmath135 where @xmath136 are closed paths , and show that this means we can shorten @xmath49 .",
    "note that if any of the paths @xmath136 are immersed in @xmath7 then we are done , simply by replacing @xmath49 .",
    "so let us assume that none of these subpaths are immersed .",
    "using similar arguments as before , this implies that @xmath137 is a closed path which is immersed in @xmath7 and we are done .",
    "armed with these sublemmas , we may remove all triple points , all crossing points and all bad triangles since there are only finitely many loops less than a given length in @xmath3 ( or @xmath7 ) .",
    "we subdivide @xmath49 into edges and vertices , labelled by their image in @xmath7 . clearly , the labelling need not be unique since @xmath49 need not be embedded , however since we have removed all triple points each label may occur at most twice .",
    "if each label occurs once , @xmath49 is embedded and we are done .",
    "otherwise , choose an `` innermost '' pair of vertices in @xmath49 with the same label .",
    "that is , choose such a pair @xmath138 and one of the paths between them , @xmath139 so that @xmath139 embeds in @xmath7 except at the endpoints .",
    "since we have removed all bad triangles , there are at most two innermost such pairs ( in fact there are exactly two , if we also keep track of the path between them and remember that we are assuming that @xmath49 is not embedded ) . for each innermost pair",
    ", choose a point between them ( ie . on the specified path ) .",
    "so we now have two points on @xmath49 and therefore two subpaths , @xmath140 between them and @xmath106 .",
    "since we have no bad triangles , both @xmath109 and @xmath110 must be embedded in @xmath7 .",
    "we have also divided @xmath49 , and hence its subpaths , according to the image in @xmath7 and use this parameterisation to finish the lemma .",
    "namely , the disjoint intervals @xmath141 correspond to edges or vertices of @xmath7 which have more than one pre - image in @xmath49 .",
    "since we have eliminated all crossing points in @xmath49 , the intervals @xmath141 appear in the same order in both @xmath109 and @xmath110 are we are done .",
    "the final step in simplifying our loop @xmath49 is to move from a collection of sausages to at most two .",

    "then , letting blowing up the constants , one would get a counter - example - sequence that contradicts lemma  [ l_3s3_7.1 ] . then , following the arguments of theorem  [ t_4s4_6.13 ] one gets that the folding paths of the counter - example - sequence will eventually enter any @xmath497-thin part , but explicit computations show that a folding path that enters the thin part can not stay for too long inside that part ( one has perhaps to understand how many times a folding path can enter the thin part . ) thus suggesting an affirmative answer to our questions .",
    "we have seen that iterates of automorphisms produce quasi - geodesics ( and geodesics for the non - symmetric metric . )",
    "the natural question here is whether automorphisms have an axis and whether can such an axis be described in terms of metric properties .",
