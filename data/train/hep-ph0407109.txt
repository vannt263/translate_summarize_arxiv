    "the experimental investigation of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions offers a unique possibility of studying the properties of strongly interacting matter at a high energy density . in that regime",
    "the hadronic matter is expected to become deconfined and a gas of asymptotically free quarks and gluons is formed .",
    "this is a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in which the colour interactions between the partons are screened owing to collective effects  @xcite .",
    "one of the important tools to study qgp properties in heavy ion collisions is a qcd jet production .",
    "medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , the so - called jet quenching , has been proposed to be very different in cold nuclear matter and in qgp , resulting in many challenging observable phenomena  @xcite .",
    "recent rhic data on suppression of inclusive high - p@xmath5 charge and neutral hadron production from star  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , phobos  @xcite and brahms  @xcite are in agreement with the jet quenching hypothesis  @xcite",
    ". however direct event - by - event reconstruction of jets and their characteristics is not available in rhic experiments at the moment , while the assumption that the integrated yield of all high-@xmath6 particles originates only from the jet fragmentation is not obvious .    at lhc a new regime of heavy ion physics",
    "will be reached at @xmath7 tev where hard and semi - hard qcd multi - particle production can dominate over underlying soft events .",
    "the initial gluon densities in pb@xmath8pb reactions at lhc are expected to be significantly higher than at rhic , implying a stronger partonic energy loss which can be observable in various new channels  @xcite . in particular , the influence of the medium - modified fragmentation of heavy quarks on dilepton spectra was analyzed in  @xcite . since the estimated event rates for b quark production at lhc energies are expected to be high enough , in combination with high-@xmath6 jet production by gluon and light quark fragmentation this can give important information about the medium - induced effects for both light and heavy partons in nucleus - nucleus interactions at the lhc .",
    "in previous paper  @xcite we analyzed the possibility to observe the medium - induced softening jet fragmentation function ( jff ) of light partons tagged by a leading neutral or charge hadron in heavy ion collisions at the lhc . in this paper",
    "the possibility to measure the medium - modified b - jff by a leading muon is suggested and analyzed for lhc conditions . in sect .",
    "2 we give the main definitions of jff , calculate the cross section of @xmath9 production at lhc energies with pythia generator and estimate the expected event rate for the realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts .",
    "3 describes shortly a model of partonic energy loss in qgp used to evaluate the sensitivity of b - jff to the jet quenching effect .",
    "discussion on numerical results and summary can be found in sect .",
    "let us recall that the jet fragmentation function @xmath11 determines the probability for a final `` jet - induced '' particle to carry a fraction @xmath12 of the jet transverse momentum @xmath13 . in nuclear @xmath14 interactions",
    "jff for leading particles can be defined as  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the leading particle transverse momentum , @xmath17 is the momentum fraction relatively to @xmath6 of the parent parton ( of course , without energy loss @xmath18 in the leading order of perturbative qcd ) , @xmath19 is the minimum threshold for energy of observable jets .",
    "the rate of @xmath20-type jets in mid - rapidity with transverse momentum @xmath6 in @xmath14 collisions at the given impact parameter @xmath21 is estimated as @xmath22 and is determined by the absolute value of partonic energy loss as well as by the angular radiation spectrum . here",
    "@xmath23 are the distances between the nucleus centers and the jet production vertex @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the maximum possible transverse distance @xmath26 from the nuclear collision axis to the @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the radius of the nucleus @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the nuclear thickness function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed nuclear geometry explanations ) .",
    "the effective shift @xmath31 of the jet momentum spectrum depends on the jet angular cone size @xmath32 ( see fig.1 ) . in the leading order of perturbative qcd the jet production cross section , @xmath33 ,",
    "is calculated in our case with pythia6.2  @xcite .",
    "the rate of high-@xmath6 jet - induced hadrons is estimated as @xmath34 where the shift @xmath35 of the hadron momentum distribution generally is not equal to the mean in - medium partonic energy loss due to the steep fall - off of the @xmath6-spectrum  @xcite .    for jets initiated by light hadrons ,",
    "the leading particles are the charged or neutral hadrons .",
    "however for heavy quark initiated jets there is the possibility to have a leading muon produced by semileptonic meson decays .",
    "thus jet tagged by high-@xmath6 muon can be identified as a heavy quark jet .",
    "note that @xmath36 of @xmath37mesons and @xmath38 of @xmath39mesons decay to muons , about half of the muons from @xmath37decays being produced through an intermediate @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we used pythia6.2",
    "@xcite with cteq5l pdf parameterization to calculate the cross section of b - jet production and the corresponding spectra at @xmath41 tev and to estimate the expected event rate for the realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts . to be specific",
    ", the geometry of compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector is considered  @xcite : the pseudo - rapidity coverage @xmath42 for jets and @xmath43 for muons .",
    "we define the muon as a leading particle if it belongs a hard jet and carries larger @xmath44 of the jet transverse momentum . to be specific , the jet energy is determined here as the total transverse energy of the final particles collected around the direction of a leading particle inside the cone @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle respectively .",
    "extra cuts @xmath48 gev/@xmath49 and @xmath50 gev were applied . then the corresponding @xmath51",
    "cross section for @xmath52 production is @xmath53pb , and pb@xmath8pb cross section is estimated as @xmath54 mb . the corresponding event rate in a one month pb@xmath8pb run ( assuming 15 days of data taking ) , @xmath55 s , with luminosity @xmath56@xmath57s@xmath58 , is @xmath59 in this case .",
    "increasing the minimal jet energy results in reducing expected statistics , e.g. for @xmath60 gev the estimated rate is only @xmath61 events .",

    "figure 2 shows the b - jff  ( [ dz ] ) of leading muons for the cases without and with medium - induced energy loss in central pb@xmath8pb collisions with the two parameterizations of the distribution on the gluon emission angles ( [ sar ] ) and ( [ war ] ) ; the same geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts as described in sect .  2 were used .",
    "one can see the softening b - jff due to partonic energy loss at @xmath110 .",
    "the effect enhances with @xmath12 decreasing ( see fig.3 ) and is more pronounced for the small - angular radiation .",
    "the reason for the latter fact is following .",
    "the contribution of the small - angular radiation to the total jet energy loss ( due to `` out - of - cone '' partonic energy loss ) is much lesser as compared with the broad - angular radiation .",
    "the former does not disappear totally mostly because not only leading ( parent ) parton , but all partons of a jet pass through the dense medium and emit gluons under the angles @xmath100 relatively to their proper directions , which in general may not coincide with the jet axis ( determined by the direction of a leading particle ) and sometimes be even at the jet periphery .",
    "the broad - angular radiation increases the `` out - of - cone '' part of partonic energy loss and thus decreases the final jet transverse momentum @xmath13 ( which is the denominator in the definition of @xmath111 in jff  ( [ dz ] ) ) without any influence on the numerator of @xmath12 and , as a consequence , in reducing effect on jff softening .",
    "note that in the real experimental situation the jet observables will be sensitive to the accuracy of jet energy reconstruction in a high multiplicity environment , in particular , to the systematic jet energy loss .",
    "however , since the average reconstructed jet energy in pb@xmath8pb collisions is expected to be the same as in @xmath51 interactions ( see section `` jet detection at cms '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the short measure of jet energy will be the well - controlled systematic error for heavy ion as well for @xmath51 collisions , and it can be taken into account using the standard calibration procedure .    in summary ,",
    "the channel with the muon tagged b - jet production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions was first analyzed .",
    "the reasonable statistics , @xmath0 events per 1 month of lhc run with lead beams , can be expected for the realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts .",
    "the effect on the medium - modified b - jet fragmentation was numerically studied for pb@xmath8pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "the significant softening b - jet fragmentation function determined by the absolute value of partonic energy loss and the angular radiation spectrum is predicted .    _",
