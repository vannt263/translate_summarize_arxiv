    "the presence of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase rapidly replaced by an anomalous metallic phase upon doping is one of the prominent features of the phase diagram of high temperature superconducting cuprates @xcite .",
    "indeed it was early suggested @xcite that the proximity to an insulating magnetic phase together with the nearly twodimensional structure of these materials could be responsible for the superconducting and anomalous normal - state ( i.e. non - fermi liquid ) properties of these systems via the creation of a quantum - disordered spin liquid ( resonating - valence - bond state ) . since",
    "then a great deal of attention has been devoted to the fascinating interplay between magnetism and charge degrees of freedom , leading to various theoretical proposals and to different scenarios for the metal - insulator transition at low doping .",
    "one scenario is based on the tendency of a magnetically ordered phase to segregate the additional holes due to doping @xcite .",
    "the tendency to phase separation is then frustrated by the coulombic repusion between the segregated carriers @xcite , thus leading to formation of hole - rich domain walls separating af domains in the form of stripe textures . within this scenario , pseudogaps naturally arise in the underdoped phase of the materials as a consequence of stripe fluctuations and local pair formation @xcite .",
    "obviously this will substantially affect the transition to the af insulating phase at low doping @xcite .",
    "the transition between a magnetically ordered phase and a metallic state can also be strongly affected by extrinsic ingredients like the disorder induced by dopant ions ( sr or zn in the case of @xmath8 ) .",
    "this may lead to the formation of local random magnetic moments giving rise to spin - glass ordering between the af insulating and the paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) phases @xcite .",
    "the stripe and the spin - glass scenarios clearly illustrate the complicated and rich nature that the af - pm transition may take . however , other proposals are more directly related to magnetism and to the contiguity between the af and the metallic phase .",
    "these proposals start from the seminal work of ref .",
    "@xcite showing that the materials with half - filled cuo@xmath9 planes are suitably described in terms of a twodimensional quantum heisenberg af model with very small interplanar coupling .",
    "following work @xcite suggested that , although the 2d model displays long - range order at @xmath10 , upon doping the added charges enhance the quantum spin fluctuations thus driving the system into a disordered state even at zero temperature ( quantum disordered phase ) @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of an af quantum critical point ( qcp ) provides a natural framework to intepret the scaling behavior at low temperatures and low frequencies of the of the @xmath11-integrated magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath13 can be experimentally determined via magnetic resonance measurements of the nuclear copper spin - echo decay rate , @xmath14 and spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is seen that in a range of temperatures @xmath16 , depending on doping , @xmath17 @xcite . assuming the scaling relations @xcite , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a dynamic critical exponent , @xmath21 an anomalous dimension , @xmath22 the antiferromagnetic ordering wave - vector , @xmath23 the correlation length , @xmath24 a scaling function",
    ", one gets @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the constancy of this ratio is thus interpreted as the signature of a critical behavior corresponding to a @xmath3 value of the dynamic index @xcite .",
    "the strong critical spin fluctuations occurring at the af - qcp have also been claimed to provide a possible source of pairing and normal - state anomalies .    despite the apparent simplicity of a scenario involving a direct transition between an insulating af phase and a pm phase ,",
    "such a transition is far from being trivial and is still an open problem .",
    "the main difficulty is in the lack of a microscopic model being able to smoothly interpolate between an insulating af ordered phase with gapped charge excitation and a pm phase . on the one hand ,",
    "the insulating af phase is suitably represented by the heisenberg model and , in particular , the long - wavelength and low frequency behavior of spin fluctuations in the cuo@xmath9 planes can be well described by the quantum non - linear sigma model @xcite , which at zero temperature and in two spatial dimensions is characterized by the action @xmath26 here @xmath27 is a three - component vector field subject to the real - space constraint @xmath28 which describes the local staggered magnetization , and @xmath29 is a coupling constant .    it was first argued in @xcite that this description could be carried over to the case of the lightly doped compounds .",
    "in fact , one can think that in this case the @xmath27 field continues giving an effective description of the electron spins localized on the cu sites of the lattice , while the presence of itinerating holes provides a finite renormalization of the coupling constant .",
    "the theory described by the action ( [ pura ] ) , besides having the correct symmetries , realizes a zero - temperature transition for a given critical value @xmath30 of the coupling ( see @xcite for the quantum version and @xcite for the classical theory ) thus providing a good model for the physical picture of the af - qcp @xcite . from this point of view the @xmath3 value of",
    "the dynamic scaling exponent is a simple consequence of the lorentz invariance of ( [ pura ] ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the non - linear @xmath31 model does not properly describe the low - energy charge excitations , which are characteristic of a metallic state possibly providing a damping mechanism for spin - waves ( see , e.g. , case b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore the model in eq .",
    "[ pura ] provides a good description of a transition between an insulating ( charge - gapped ) af ( afi ) and an insulating paramagnet ( pi ) . , but it appears to be inappropriate when spin - waves can decay in low - energy particle - hole excitations .    on the other hand , attempts have also been made to provide a microscopic basis for the transition to a pm phase . in this regard two distint cases a and b depending on the shape of the fermi surface in the metal were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite within a spin - density - wave approach . in case",
    "a the af wavevector @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the lattice spacing ) was not able to connect points of the fermi surface , so that momentum and energy conservation did not allow the decay of spin - waves in particle - hole pairs . in this case",
    "the transition was naturally characterized by a dynamic critical index @xmath34 . in case b , instead , there were ( `` hot '' ) points on the fermi surface connected by @xmath35 so that low - energy particle - hole pairs could be created by the decay of low - energy spin - waves .",
    "however , in both cases , a and b , the phase with af long - range order is metallic and therefore the model does not suitably describe a transition between an afi and a pm   model would suitably describe the system also in this case despite the metallic character of both the ordered and disordered phases . ] . the case a above shares some common features with a mixed spin - fermion model without a three - body ( i.e. kondo - like ) direct coupling between the local moments and",
    "the fermion spins @xcite .",
    "this model has been shown @xcite to display a @xmath10 transition between a metallic ( fermi liquid ) phase with spin commensurate long - range order and a metallic ( also fermi liquid ) quantum disordered phase .",
    "owing to the absence of the three body coupling responsible for the direct spin - wave decay into particle - hole pairs , also the qcp of this model is characterized by @xmath34 .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "no simple microscopic modelization is presently available to describe a direct afi - pm transition .",
    "of course the possibilities remain open that other extrinsic mechanisms ( stripes , disorder , ... ) provide intermediate steps between the afi and the pm phases .",
    "alternatively , one may also envisage that an afi to a pi phase transition occurs first at lower doping , followed at slightly larger doping by a pi - pm transition between two spin - disordered phases .",
    "together with the basic difficulty outlined above , the additional question arises concerning the observed @xmath34 critical behavior in the underdoped phase of the cuprates and the way this can be reconciled with the metallic character of this phase .",
    "in particular it is believed that the fermi surface of the cuprates in the metallic phase contains `` hot '' points connected by the af wavevector",
    ". therefore it should be possible for the spin - waves of arbitrarily low energy to decay into particle - hole pairs and get overdamped .",
    "this would lead to a relaxational behavior contrasting with the @xmath34 ( i.e. propagating ) critical behavior of the spin - waves .",
    "moreover , by accepting a @xmath36 critical behavior in the metallic phase , it remains to clarify how this may turn into the natural propagating behavior , which characterizes the spin excitations in the ordered side of the qcp .",
    "this latter difficulty was also encountered and stressed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite for their case b : within their mean - field description a @xmath36 behavior was obtained both in the disordered and the ordered af ( metallic ) phases .",
    "this suggested that the simple formulation b of the mean - field sdw model was only applicable on the disordered side of ( and not too close to ) the af - qcp .    in the present paper",
    "we will not attempt to find a microscopic foundation to a direct afi - pm transition , but we will instead start from a semiphenomenological point of view by introducing a field - theoretical generalization of the non - linear @xmath31 model action ( [ pura ] ) to investigate a ) the condition to be fullfilled by a simple ( @xmath37-independent ) damping term in order to maintain a @xmath34 critical behavior ; b ) how in the @xmath38 case an additional crossover energy must behave in the ordered phase to provide a scale separating damped spin excitations at high energy and propagating spin excitations at low energy .    the resulting theory will depend on the precise form of the effective damping term .",
    "we first discuss the simpler case of the metallic phase on the @xmath39 side of the qcp . within a microscopic model of spins coupled to free itinerant holes , integrating out the holes degrees of freedom in the random phase approximation",
    "gives a damping term of the form @xmath40 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "however , the choice of the adequate low frequency form of @xmath41 should also take in consideration the fact that in underdoped cuprates a significant loss of low - frequency spectral weight is observed at low temperatures in the distribution of quasi - particles , a phenomenon often referred to as `` pseudogap '' ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . the origin of this effect is a debated issue , and has been alternatively interpreted : as the result of spin - fermion scattering @xcite , as due to the intrinsecally non - fermi liquid nature of the system ( luttinger liquid ) @xcite , as a signal of the formation of preformed pairs for @xmath42 @xcite , as due to stripe charge fluctuations @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "a precise computation of these effects implies solving a difficult self - consistency problem going well beyond the rpa approach .",
    "we shall try here a rough , phenomenological approach , assuming that the damping coefficient @xmath43 can acquire at low frequencies an @xmath44-dependence @xmath45 , thus giving rise to an effective damping term of the form @xmath1 , with @xmath46   case corresponds to the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite within a large - n framework . ] .",
    "_ _ _ _    once chosen a damping term @xmath47 we perform a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of the resulting theory in the proximity of the qcp using the momentum - shell method and @xmath5-expansion .",
    "we observe the existence of two fixed points , which we shall denote fp1 and fp2 , showing respectively a @xmath3 , undamped spin - wave behavior and a @xmath48 , dissipative behavior .",
    "the point fp1 corresponds to the zero - temperature critical point of a pure quantum non - linear sigma model without any damping term , but it becomes unstable in a wide region of the parameters with respect to the dissipative fixed point fp2 .",
    "there exists a range of values @xmath49 for which one obtains a @xmath50 dynamic scaling exponent in the proximity of the stable quantum critical point , even in the presence of a damping term . in other words , there are `` soft '' damping terms which do not destroy the @xmath3 , spin - wave behavior . here",
    "@xmath51 is the dimension dependent lower bound for the exponents in the soft damping term , which we determine to be @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the anomalous field dimension and @xmath54 is its value at the fp1 . it is worth noting that this result bears a resemblance to what is found in classical models with long - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "in particular the scaling exponent of the damping stems from the non - analytic form of @xmath47 , which is not reconstructed by the rg corrections ( for a discussion of this point in classical models see ref .",
    ". therefore @xmath55 does not acquire singular corrections but for the anomalous field dimensions .",
    "within the framework of an expansion in @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the spatial dimension of the system and @xmath58 is the bare value of the dynamic scaling exponent in the vicinity of the stable fixed point , one would get @xmath59 , where the 1 or 2 subscripts in @xmath60 refer to fp1 or fp2 respectively . however , the extrapolation of results valid for @xmath61 to the physical region @xmath7 should be done with great care . in particular , using the numerical results for the critical exponents of the @xmath62 model in 2 + 1 dimensions , it appears that @xmath51 is very near to two and the range of `` soft '' @xmath63 values should be a very narrow one .",
    "this means that within the here - considered model the appearance of a @xmath3 critical behavior in the cuprates can not be accounted for in the effective framework without assuming a value @xmath64 , _",
    "i.e. _ , an almost linear decay of the quasi - particle spectral weight for low frequencies .",
    "this spectral weight suppression is a rather severe condition to be obtained from the magnetic scattering itself , as also suggested by a direct perturbative calculation within a spin - fermion model @xcite , where density of states and vertex corrections to the fermion bubble produced only a minor change of the power - law dependence of the damping term .",
    "it is worth noting that a substantial spectral weight reduction is however consistent with anderson s idea that a smooth connection between a charge - gapped insulator and a fermi - liquid metal is hardly conceivable . _",
    "_    as far as the ordered phase is concerned , ( point ( b ) above ) it is necessary to take into account the presence of a non - zero staggered magnetization @xmath65 , which is accompanied by the presence of two quasi - particle bands separated by an energy @xmath66 .",
    "this suggests @xcite to introduce a damping term having two distinct asymptotics : @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 , with @xmath71   in the ordered ( as well as in the disordered ) phase , but in a first approximation we ignore this dependence mainly for simplicity reasons , but also because in the insulating phase , where a gap for the charge excitations providing spin - wave decay is present , it would be unnatural to expect a relevant q - dependence . ]",
    "the difficult point here is that the scale @xmath72 separating damped and undamped spin excitations vanishes at the transition .",
    "this prevents using a conventional rg approach , and we will resort to simple scaling arguments and phenomenological assumptions . our analysis does not attain the same degree of reliability of a traditional landau - ginzburg - wilson theory and has a heuristic character .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath73 has a power - law behavior , to be determined by matching the hydrodynamic behaviors on the two sides of the quantum transition .",

    "it is not unreasonable to expect that the damped sigma model we considered contains some of the physics of the quantum critical point of the underdoped layered cuprates . for this reason we performed a rg analysis directly on this model , trying to maintain sufficient generality in the form of the effective damping term , in particular introducing an exponent @xmath332 that could account for the observed pseudogap behavior . in the broken symmetry phase we tried to get some insight on the interplay between damping and af ordering using simple scaling arguments .    in both",
    "the ordered and the disordered phases , assuming continuity of the hydrodynamic behaviors at the quantum transition , we obtained that for @xmath74 ( where @xmath333 is expected to be very close to 2 ) it is not possible to account for the observed @xmath34 scaling law .",
    "it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath34 scaling can be recovered at higher temperatures , when typical frequencies would become larger than the @xmath10 value of the damping term . however , experimentally it is the @xmath34 behavior which is observed at lower temperatures , while a relaxational @xmath36 behavior is observed at higher @xmath334 @xcite .",
    "it was argued @xcite that this could be due to the neglected @xmath334-dependence of the damping term @xmath55 .",
    "we propose in this paper that the same effect can be accounted for by assuming that the decay of the quasi - particle spectral weight for low frequencies produces a  soft \" damping term @xmath335 with @xmath336 .",
    "the @xmath34 scaling would then be a consequence of an almost linear decay of the quasi - particle spectral weight .",
    "we notice that this reduced weight is fully consistent with the observed occurrence of a pseudogap below a crossover temperature @xmath337 in the underdoped region of the phase diagram for the cuprates .",
    "the origin of this pseudogap might arise from extrinsic mechanisms like local cooper - pair formation and/or stripe fluctuations .",
    "alternatively a pseudogap could be the very consequence of the intrinsecally non fermi liquid nature of the system  @xcite or of strong critical fluctuations occurring near the qcp .",
    "in this last regard singular af fluctuations have been shown within a spin - fermion model to strongly modify the quasiparticles properties @xcite in the proximity of the `` hot''points of the fermi surface separated by the af wavevector .",
    "since the particle - hole excitations around these points are responsible for the low - energy spin - wave decay , this naturally affects the damping of spin excitations , in a complicated interplay which deserves further investigation .",
    "we notice that the fluctuation - induced spectral weight reduction for the fermionic excitations is a definite signature of a non - fermi liquid metallic state .",
    "this is in agreement with general arguments put forward by anderson ( see _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) on the difficulty in continuously connecting a charge - gapped insulating phase with a normal fermi - liquid phase .",
    "we remark , however , that anderson s arguments extend the presence of a non - fermi - liquid phase all over the metallic state as a consequence of low dimensionality . on the other hand , within the qcp scenario ,",
    "the violation of the fermi - liquid properties is a consequence of critical fluctuations , which are only present around the critical point .",
    "as soon as one moves away from this point , the fluctuations loose their critical character thus providing simple perturbative corrections to the fermi liquid state .",
    "it is worth noting that the analysis carried out in this paper is not only related to the superconducting cuprates , but it has connections with other physically interesting problems , like the spin chains with long range interaction and macroscopic quantum tunnelling . by considering the model ( [ azione1 ] ) in @xmath338 ,",
    "it is seen that the frequency axis is left as the only relevant `` direction '' ( cf .",
    "the technical considerations presented in appendix [ compcritind ] ) . as a first consequence , all the critical behavior should be reformulated in terms of frequency by suitably rescaling of the critical indices by @xmath339 .",
    "the frequency axis becomes then equivalent to a single space direction , via the dynamic critical index @xmath20 , thus establishing a connection with onedimensional classical models .",
    "fourier transforming back to ( imaginary ) times the damping term in ( [ azione1 ] ) gives rise to a long range interaction of the type @xmath340 .",
    "our results can be directly extended to the case @xmath341 .",
    "this leads to the comparison with the onedimensional ( classical ) @xmath342-component spin model with long - range interaction considered in ref .",
    "one can recognize that , once the spatial term is dropped in ( [ azione1 ] ) the connection is established through the coupling combinations @xmath275 and @xmath343 .",
    "this allows to rewrite the rg equation for @xmath344 in the same form as eq .",

    "whitin the @xmath338 case , @xmath346 deserves special attention because of the connection with macroscopic quantum tunnelling  @xcite .",
    "this connection is realized by observing that the @xmath347 non - linear @xmath31 model can be rewritten in terms of an angular degree of freedom and that the addition of the magnetic field produces a cos - like interaction ( sine - gordon model ) . in @xmath338",
    "the model then describes a single degree of freedom with a kinetic ( @xmath348 ) term in a multivalley potential . in the presence of dissipation ,",
    "a linear - in - frequency term can appear , leading again to long - range interactions on the ( imaginary ) time axis .",

    "for @xmath160 the expressions ( [ loop],[conv ] ) reduce to @xmath362 the same expressions can be obtained by a direct evaluation of ( [ loop0 ] , [ kappaf ] ) for @xmath223 .",
    "in particular the original expression ( [ loop0 ] ) shows that @xmath363 is in fact an analytic function of @xmath364 and @xmath43 .",
    "however , some problems arise when using expressions ( [ loop2 ] ) and ( [ conv2 ] ) to compute critical indices directly for @xmath365 instead of considering the @xmath366 limit of the general expressions given in section 3.1 . for @xmath365 in fact one",

    "if the same computation is performed using field - theoretical methods , instead of wilson s integration on the momentum shell , no such problems arise : _",
    "e.g. _ one has @xmath369 which correctly behaves as @xmath370 for @xmath371 , independently of the value of @xmath63 .",
    "notice that the @xmath372 factor coming from @xmath373 is cancelled by the factor @xmath374 and the @xmath375 divergence arises from @xmath376 .",
    "the problems with the wilson method are resolved if one makes a more symmetric choice of the integration shell , _",

    "@xmath163 is finite for @xmath224 .",
    "we observed that @xmath379 computed with either choice of cutoffs have the same @xmath380 dependence , the only effect of the choice of the symmetric shell being that the integrals do not vanish for @xmath224 .",
    "in particular , the expressions for @xmath381 , @xmath382 given in the text are valid for @xmath383 : as a matter of fact , they are computed from the values ( [ iaka ] ) , which do not contain the angular integration factor @xmath373 ."
