    "how gas is converted into stars is an important question crucial to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution",
    ". an empirical way of quantifying this was given by @xcite and extended by @xcite .",
    "the kennicutt  schmidt ( k  s ) relation is a power law relation between @xmath1  and @xmath3   averaged over the star - forming disks of nearby galaxies .",
    "insight into the physical processes regulating star formation has been sought by trying to model the k ",
    "s relation @xcite using physical principles as well as empirical clues .",
    "only recently have surveys of nearby galaxies reached sufficient sensitivities at all requisite wavelengths to study the k  s relation on sub - kpc scales .",
    "examples include the study of nearby spiral galaxies by @xcite . in a similar study",
    ", @xcite showed that a linear k  s relation exists between the surface density of molecular gas and @xmath1 .",
    "this is not unexpected as the molecular phase of hydrogen traces the molecular clouds where star formation actually occurs .",
    "a linear k  s relation between @xmath4  and @xmath1  has also been shown to hold in the atomic hydrogen dominated outer discs of nearby spirals @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in the very outskirts of spiral discs ( outside r@xmath5 ) , where molecular hydrogen can not be detected and atomic hydrogen ( hi ) dominates , there is a clear relationship between fuv and hi column density , with the star formation efficiency increasing with increasing hi column .",
    "the inferred gas consumption timescales in these regions were well above a hubble time ( @xmath6 years ) .",
    "similar results were found in recent resolved sub - kpc studies of hi and star formation in dwarf galaxies by @xcite .",
    "one crucial factor to take into account when determining the relation between gas and star formation in the hi dominated regime is the low star formation rate surface densities in this regime .",
    "very deep imaging data is required to measure fluxes accurately .",
    "in addition , since direct tracers of star formation primarily trace young high mass stars ( @xmath7 16 @xmath8  for @xmath9 , @xmath7 6 @xmath8  for fuv ) , the high mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) will be sampled stochastically for low sfrs resulting in considerable fluctuation in the luminosity of the tracer across an ensemble of systems with the same sfr .",
    "bursty sf histories will also result in errors when using calibrations which assume continuous star formation during the previous myr or so .",
    "@xcite have simulated the effects of stochasticity and bursty sf history on the measurement of sfrs using different tracers .",
    "they show that that a bursty sf history leads to the peak of the distribution of sfrs measured for an ensemble of simulated systems to be offset on the lower side compared to the true sfr put in as input , and this offset increases with decreasing sfr .",
    "stochasticity in the sampling of the imf leads to the scatter in measured sfrs increasing with decreasing sfr . in a recent study",
    ", @xcite computed a relation between sfr and atomic gas surface density in nearby dwarf irregulars _ averaged _ over their star - forming discs , and found that the @xmath10  based k  s relation is not steep , but almost linear .",
    "the implied efficiency of star formation was low in hi dominated dwarf galaxies , but it did not decrease as a function of hi surface density as found by @xcite .",
    "a more systematic study of the relation between @xmath1  and @xmath3  in the hi dominated regime is therefore now in order . here",
    "we study the relation between @xmath1  and @xmath3  in nearby @xmath11 spirals and dwarf galaxies over different scales , carefully accounting for how we measure low sfrs .",
    "we start with kpc sized regions and zoom in further to study trends such as changes in scatter in the @xmath1  ",
    "@xmath3  plane .",
    "we also study how the k ",
    "s relation changes for few tens of kpc sized regions in a sample of @xmath11 spirals with very large hi - to - optical size ratios .",
    "the first sample is of spiral galaxies from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "things is a high spatial and velocity resolution interferometric survey of hi in 34 nearby galaxies using the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the sample spans a wide range in luminosity and mass , and included a handful of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the things galaxies used in the present study have co detections from the hera co line extragalactic survey ( heracles * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath12  data , and low inclination angles .",
    "this is the same sample used by @xcite to derive the linear k  s relation between @xmath1  and @xmath4 .",
    "our sample is also part of the study of the very outskirts of spirals by @xcite .",
    "all galaxies have _ galex _ fuv observations which in combination with _ spitzer _",
    "24 @xmath12  data is used to estimate their sfrs .",
    "we exclude one galaxy ( ngc 3184 ) from the @xcite sample whose _ galex _ observations are from the low exposure time all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) rather than being from the medium imaging survey ( mis ) or guest investigator data . another galaxy ( ngc 2841 )",
    "was excluded for not having co data sensitive enough to trace the full disk , especially the central regions where there is high star formation but a prominent hole in the hi distribution .",
    "tracing the co in the central regions of our sample galaxies is important because as mentioned in section  [ ssec : gas ] , we use co emission to exclude regions where hi does not dominate the gas in the ism .    the final sample of things spiral galaxies are listed in table  [ tab : sampt ]",
    ". columns ( 1 ) gives the galaxy name , ( 2 ) the mass in stars ( from * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , ( 4 ) the distance to the galaxy taken from @xcite for all galaxies except ngc 5194 @xcite .",
    "column ( 5 ) gives the resolution in kpc corresponding to the co resolution of @xmath1313 arcsec .",
    "we require hi maps at linear resolutions of @xmath13400 pc ( see section  [ sec : ana ] ) , and seven of the galaxies had maps with average beam sizes comparable to 400 pc depending on the weighting scheme chosen : natural ( na ) or robust ( ro ) , and these are listed in column ( 6 ) .",
    ".things spiral galaxy sample [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section , we compare our derived k ",
    "s relations with predicted trends from two widely used models of star formation based on the following papers : ( i ) @xcite hereafter oml , ( ii ) @xcite hereafter kmt .",
    "the oml model assumes that atomic gas has achieved two - phase thermal and quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium . in the kmt model ,",
    "hydrostatic balance sets the requirements for the formation of the cnm phase and the atomic - to - molecular transition , except at very low metallicities where it is set by the two - phase thermal equilibrium at the maximum allowed cnm temperature @xcite .",
    "we consider the predictions of the respective models for the low sfr , low metallicity , hi - dominated regime .",
    "therefore for oml model we consider equation ( 22 ) from @xcite .",
    "for the kmt model , we consider the combination of equations ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) from @xcite .    when comparing the models with our observations four parameters used in both the oml and kmt models need to be considered : metallicity , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the clumping factor . for the figgs galaxies the metallicity",
    "is fixed at 0.1 z@xmath16 , whereas for the spirals from things and ` bluedisks ' surveys , the metallicity is varied between 0.4 to 1 z@xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 in the models which refers to the density of stellar @xmath17 dark matter is varied between 0.003 to 0.03 @xmath18 ( following * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is the models which is related to the fraction of neutral gas in the warm phase is varied between 0.05 and 1 . from @xcite we know that hi clumps much less when observed at high resolution compared to co , and in fact the clumping factor for hi remains almost constant .",
    "as we are only sensitive to hi emission , we follow the empirical relation given in @xcite and adopt a clumping factor of @xmath13 1.3 at 400 pc and 1 kpc scales ( in comparison with what will be observed at 100 pc resolution ) and @xmath13 1.5 at 10 kpc scales .",
    "models with the range in parameters given above are shown in figure  [ fig : th ] .",
    "we see that the predictions of the oml model match our observations better than the predictions of the kmt model for galaxies of all types .",
    "it is interesting that our data agrees with the oml model , since recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite have shown that turbulence driven by supernova feedback regulates the thermal pressure in the outer discs of galaxies , and this thermal pressure plays a crucial role in the oml models .",
    "this may imply that the ism in outer discs of spirals and dwarfs is stabilized by feedback .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have emphasized the primacy of feedback in determining how gas converts into stars ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "we study the spatially resolved kennicutt ",
    "schmidt relation between @xmath1  and @xmath10   in the hi dominated ism in spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies across a wide range of spatial scales and gas surface densities .",
    "we account for the uncertainties associated with measuring low sfrs within small regions by averaging over sfr in fixed bins of hi surface density . for dwarfs to spirals , and across different scales , the k ",
    "s relation is found to have a slope of @xmath131.5 .",
    "the efficiency with which the cold neutral gas is being converted into starts is an order of magnitude more inefficient than within the optical discs of spirals .",
    "a surprising conclusion from our findings in that the mean kennicutt - schmidt relation in hi dominated regions is independent of metallicity .",
    "our results favour a model of star formation where thermal and pressure equilibrium in the outer ism regulate the rate at which star formation occurs , where the thermal pressure in turn is set by supernova feedback .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , frank bigiel for his constructive comments which helped improve the paper .",
    "we thank ayesha begum for providing the visibilities which were used to derive the hi maps for figgs galaxies used in this work .",
