    "at the last durham workshop on hera physics , hera was heralded as the new frontier for qcd . in the proceedings from that workshop , there was one theoretical contribution on  partons and qcd effects in the pomeron \"  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the large rapidity gap events in deep inelastic scattering were yet to be discovered and the first preliminary results on photoproduced vector mesons were just starting to appear .",
    "two years later , this workshop focuses on  proton , photon and pomeron structure \" : the inclusion of the word  pomeron \" in the title of the workshop reflects a series of diffractive measurements which have been made in the intervening period at hera .",
    "this talk is therefore an opportunity to discuss  _ measurements _ of partons and qcd effects in the pomeron \" , based on results from the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "the diffractive processes studied are of the form : @xmath0 where the the photon dissociates into the system @xmath1 and the outgoing proton , @xmath2 , remains intact , corresponding to single dissociation .",
    "the measurements are made as a function of the photon virtuality , @xmath3 the centre - of - mass energy of the virtual - photon proton system , @xmath4 , the mass of the dissociated system , @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath5 and the four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , given by @xmath6 .",
    "the subject of diffraction is far from new : diffractive processes have been measured and studied for more than thirty years  @xcite .",
    "their relation to the corresponding total cross sections at high energies has been successfully interpreted via the introduction of a single pomeron trajectory with a characteristic @xmath7 and @xmath8 dependence  @xcite .",
    "the high - energy behaviour of the total cross sections is described by a power - law dependence on @xmath7 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is measured in gev , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the pomeron intercept .",
    "the slow rise of hadron - hadron total cross sections with increasing energy indicates that the value of @xmath13 i.e. the total cross sections increase as @xmath14 , although the latest @xmath15 data from cdf at @xmath16  gev indicate @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the optical theorem relates the total cross sections to the elastic , and hence diffractive , scattering amplitude at the same @xmath7 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20gev@xmath21 reflects the shrinkage of the diffractive peak with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "whilst these regge - based models give a unified description of all pre - hera diffractive data , this approach is not fundamentally linked to the underlying theory of qcd .",
    "it has been anticipated that at hera energies if either of the scales @xmath22 , @xmath5 or @xmath8 become larger than the qcd scale @xmath23 , then it may be possible to apply perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) techniques , which predict changes to this power law behaviour , corresponding to an increase in the effective value of @xmath24 and a decrease of @xmath25 .",
    "this brings us from the regime of dominance of the slowly - rising  soft \" pomeron to the newly emergent ",
    "hard \" behaviour and the question of how a transition may occur between the two .",
    "precisely where the regge - based approach breaks down or where pqcd may be applicable is open to experimental question .",
    "the emphasis is therefore on the internal ( in)consistency of a wide range of measurements of diffractive and total cross sections . as an experimentalist navigating around the various theoretical concepts of the pomeron",
    ", it is sometimes difficult to see which direction to take and what transitions occur where  ( figure  1(a ) ) .",
    "however , from an experimental perspective , the directions are clear , even if the map is far from complete  ( figure  1(b ) ) .",
    "the hera collider allows us to observe a broad range of diffractive phenomena at the highest values of @xmath7 . what is new is that we have the ability to observe the variation of these cross sections at specific points on the @xmath5 scale , from the @xmath26 up to the @xmath27 system as discussed in section  2.1 .",
    "similarly , the production cross section can be explored as a function of @xmath22 , using a virtual photon probe .",
    "the high energy available provides a large rapidity span of @xmath28 10 units ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the observation of a significant fraction of events ( @xmath30 ) with a large rapidity gap between the outgoing proton , @xmath2 , and the rest of the final state , @xmath1 , in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has led to measurements of the internal structure of the pomeron .",
    "these results are discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "similar studies of events with high-@xmath31 jets and a large rapidity gap have also been used to provide complementary information on this structure .",
    "also , the observation of rapidity gaps between jets , corresponding to large @xmath8 diffraction , are presented in section  2.3 . finally , a first analysis of the leading proton spectrometer data where the diffracted proton is directly measured is presented in section  2.4 .",
    "the experimental signals are the exclusive production of the vector mesons in the following decay modes : @xmath32 first results on @xmath33 and higher vector mesons ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are in the early analysis stages and first candidates for @xmath36 are also appearing in the data .",
    "the clean topology of these events results in typical errors on the measured quantities ( @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath22 ) , reconstructed in the tracking chambers , of order 5% . containment within the tracking chambers corresponds to a @xmath10 interval in the range @xmath37  gev .",
    "however , some analyses are restricted to a reduced range of @xmath10 where the tracking and trigger systematics are well understood .",
    "conversely , h1 have also used the shifted vertex data to extend the analysis of the @xmath26 cross section to higher @xmath38  gev . at small @xmath8 there are problems triggering and , to a lesser extent , reconstructing the decay products of the vector meson .",
    "in particular , the photoproduction of @xmath39 mesons is limited to @xmath40  gev@xmath41 , since the produced kaons are just above threshold and the available energy in the decay is limited . in order to characterise the @xmath8-dependence",
    ", a fit to the diffractive peak is performed . in the most straightforward approach , a single exponential fit to the @xmath8 distribution , @xmath42 for @xmath43gev@xmath41",
    "is adopted .",
    "the contributions to the systematic uncertainties are similar in each of the measurements .",
    "for example , the uncertainties on acceptance of photoproduced @xmath26 s are due to uncertainties on trigger thresholds ( @xmath28  9% ) , variations of the input monte carlo distributions ( @xmath28  9% ) and track reconstruction uncertainties especially at low @xmath31 ( @xmath28  6% ) . in particular for the @xmath26 analysis , where the mass distribution is skewed compared to a breit - wigner shape , uncertainties arise due to the assumptions of the fit for the interference between the resonant signal and the non - resonant background contributions ( @xmath28  7% ) .",
    "other significant contributions to the uncertainty are contamination due to @xmath44-gas interactions ( @xmath28  2 - 5% ) and from higher mass dissociated photon states , such as elastic @xmath45 and @xmath39 decays ( @xmath28  2 - 7% ) . the uncertainty due to neglecting radiative corrections can also be estimated to be @xmath28 4 - 5%  @xcite .    finally , one of the key problems in obtaining accurate measurements of the exclusive cross sections and the @xmath8 slopes is the uncertainty on the double dissociation component , where the proton has also dissociated into a low mass nucleon system  @xcite .",
    "the forward calorimeters will see the dissociation products of the proton if the invariant mass of the nucleon system , @xmath46 , is above approximately 4  gev .",
    "a significant fraction of double dissociation events produce a limited mass system which is therefore not detected .",
    "proton remnant taggers are now being used further down the proton beamline to provide constraints on this fraction and , in the h1 experiment , further constraints are provided by measuring secondary interactions in the forward muon system . based on @xmath15 data one finds that the dissociated mass spectrum falls as @xmath47 with @xmath48 = 2.20 @xmath49 0.03 at @xmath50  gev from cdf measurements  @xcite .",
    "however it should be noted that this measurement corresponds to a restricted mass interval .",
    "the extrapolation to lower masses is subject to uncertainties and the universality of this dissociation is open to experimental question , given the different behaviour at the upper vertex .",
    "precisely how the proton dissociates and whether the proton can be regarded as dissociating independently of the photon system is not a priori known .",
    "currently , this uncertainty is reflected in the cross sections by allowing the value of @xmath48 to vary from around 2 to 3 , although this choice is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the magnitude of the total double dissociation contribution is estimated to be typically @xmath51 prior to cuts on forward energy deposition , a value which can be cross - checked in the data with an overall uncertainty of @xmath52 which is due to the considerations above . combining the above uncertainties , the overall systematic errors in the various cross sections are typically @xmath53 .",
    "photoproduction processes have been extensively studied in fixed - target experiments , providing a large range in @xmath10 over which to study the cross sections .",
    "the key features are the weak dependence of the cross section on @xmath10 , an exponential dependence on @xmath8 with a slope which shrinks with increasing @xmath10 and the retention of the helicity of the photon by the vector meson .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the @xmath26 photoproduction data is illustrated in figure  2 where the h1 and zeus data are compared to a compilation of lower energy data  @xcite .",
    "the data are consistent with a shrinkage of the @xmath8 slope with increasing @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the photon energy in the proton rest frame , as indicated by the curve for soft pomeron exchange  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath8 slopes are @xmath56  gev@xmath21  ( h1 )  @xcite and @xmath57  gev@xmath21  ( zeus )  @xcite for the @xmath26 ( where similar single - exponential fits have been applied ) .",
    "these values can be compared to @xmath58  gev@xmath21  ( zeus )  @xcite for the @xmath39 and @xmath59  gev@xmath21  ( h1 )  @xcite for the @xmath60 .",
    "physically , the slope of the @xmath8 dependence in diffractive interactions tells us about the effective radius of that interaction , @xmath61 : if d@xmath62 , then b @xmath28 1/4 @xmath63 .",
    "the range of measured @xmath64 slopes varies from around 4  gev@xmath21 ( @xmath65  fm ) to 10  gev@xmath21 ( @xmath66  fm ) .",
    "further , the interaction radius can be approximately related to the radii of the interacting proton and vector meson , @xmath67 .",
    "given @xmath68  fm , then this variation in @xmath64 slopes corresponds to a significant change in the effective radius of the interacting vector meson from @xmath69  fm to @xmath70  fm .",
    "= 10.cm    integrating over the measured @xmath8 dependence ,",
    "the @xmath10 dependence of the results on exclusive vector meson photoproduction cross sections are shown in figure  3  @xcite . from the experimental perspective",
    ", there is generally good agreement on the measured cross sections .",
    "the @xmath71 total cross section is also shown in figure  3 , rising with increasing energy as in hadron - hadron collisions and consistent with a value of @xmath13 i.e. the total cross section increases as @xmath14 .",
    "given the dominance of the pomeron trajectory at high @xmath10 and an approximately exponential behaviour of the @xmath72 distribution with slope @xmath73 , whose mean @xmath74 value is given by @xmath75 , the diffractive cross section rise is moderated from @xmath76 to @xmath77 here @xmath78 characterises the effective energy dependence after integration over @xmath8 .",
    "the observed shrinkage of the diffractive peak therefore corresponds to a relative reduction of the diffractive cross section with increasing energy .",
    "such a dependence describes the general increase of the @xmath26 , @xmath45 and @xmath39 vector meson cross sections with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "however , the rise of the @xmath60 cross section is clearly not described by such a @xmath10 dependence , the increase being described by an effective @xmath79 dependence .",
    "whilst these effective powers are for illustrative purposes only , it is clear that in exclusive @xmath60 production a new phenomenon is occurring .",
    "qualitatively , the @xmath79 dependence , corresponding to @xmath80 , could be ascribed to the rise of the gluon density observed in the scaling violations of @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath60 mass scale , @xmath5 , is larger than the qcd scale @xmath23 , and it is therefore possible to apply pqcd techniques .",
    "quantitatively , the theoretical analysis predicts that the rise of the cross section is proportional to the square of the gluon density at small-@xmath82 and allows discrimination among the latest parametrisations of the proton structure function  @xcite .",
    "we also know from measurements of the dis @xmath83 total cross section that application of formula ( 1 ) results in a value of @xmath24 which increases with increasing @xmath22 , with @xmath84 0.2 to 0.25 at @xmath85  gev@xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the corresponding relative rise of @xmath81 with decreasing @xmath82 can be described by pqcd evolution  @xcite points towards a calculable function @xmath86 for @xmath87gev@xmath41 .",
    "one contribution to the dis @xmath83 total cross section is the electroproduction of low mass vector mesons .",
    "experimentally , the statistical errors typically dominate with systematic uncertainties similar to the photoproduction case .",
    "the trigger uncertainties are significantly reduced , however , since the scattered electron is easily identified and the radiative corrections , which are more significant ( @xmath88  @xcite ) , can be corrected for .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence of the dis @xmath26 and @xmath39 cross sections for finite values of @xmath22 are shown in figure  4 , compared to the corresponding photoproduction cross sections .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence for the @xmath26 and @xmath39 electroproduction data are similar to those for the @xmath60 photoproduction data , consistent with an approximate @xmath79 dependence also shown in figure  4 .",
    "an important point to emphasise here is that the relative production of @xmath39 to @xmath26 mesons approaches the quark model prediction of 2/9 at large @xmath10 and large @xmath22 , which would indicate the applicability of pqcd to these cross sections .",
    "the measurements of the helicity angle of the vector meson decay provide a measurement of @xmath89 for the ( virtual ) photon , assuming s - channel helicity conservation , i.e. that the vector meson preserves the helicity of the photon .",
    "the photoproduction measurements for the @xmath26 are consistent with the interaction of dominantly transversely polarised photons ( @xmath90  ( zeus )  @xcite ) . however , adopting the same analysis for virtual photons , @xmath91  ( zeus )  @xcite , inconsistent with the behaviour in photoproduction and consistent with a predominantly longitudinal exchange .",
    "this predominance is expected for an underlying interaction of the virtual photon with the constituent quarks of the @xmath26 .",
    "also , the measured @xmath64 slope approximately halves from the photoproduction case to a value of @xmath92  ( zeus )  @xcite , comparable to that in the photoproduced @xmath60 case .",
    "the basic interaction is probing smaller distances , which allows a first comparison of the observed cross section with the predictions of leading - log pqcd  ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "( a )    ( b )     +     +    finally , first results based on the observation of 42 @xmath60 events at significant @xmath93  gev@xmath41 have been reported by h1  @xcite .",
    "the cross section has been evaluated in two @xmath10 intervals in order to obtain an indication of the @xmath10 dependence , as shown in figure  5 , where an estimated 50% contribution due to double dissociation has been subtracted  @xcite .",
    "the electroproduction data are shown with statistical errors only although the systematics are estimated to be smaller than these errors ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the electroproduction and photoproduction @xmath60 data are consistent with the @xmath79 dependence ( @xmath80 ) noted previously .",
    "the @xmath60 electroproduction cross section is of the same order of that of the @xmath26 data , in marked contrast to the significantly lower photoproduction cross section for the @xmath60 , even at hera energies , also shown in figure  5 .",
    "further results in this area would allow tests of the underlying dynamics for transverse and longitudinally polarised photons coupling to light and heavy quarks in the pqcd calculations .",
    "= 7.cm    in conclusion , there is an accumulating body of exclusive vector meson production data , measured with a systematic precision of @xmath94 , which exhibit two classes of @xmath7 behaviour : a slow rise consistent with that of previously measured diffractive data for low @xmath5 photoproduction data but a significant rise of these cross sections when a finite @xmath22 and/or a significant @xmath5 is measured .",
    "one of the major advances in the subject of diffraction has been the observation of large rapidity gap events in dis and their subsequent analysis in terms of a diffractive structure function  @xcite . in these analyses ,",
    "the signature of diffraction is the rapidity gap , defined by measuring the maximum pseudorapidity of the most - forward going particle with energy above 400  mev , @xmath95 , and requiring this to be well away from the outgoing proton direction .",
    "a typical requirement of @xmath96 corresponds to a low mass state measured in the detectors of @xmath97 units and a large gap of @xmath98 units with respect to the outgoing proton ( nucleon system ) . in order to increase the lever arm in @xmath5 ,",
    "the h1 and zeus analyses have extended the @xmath95 cuts to 3.2 and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "this is achieved directly using the forward muon system / proton remnant taggers , in the case of h1 , or via the measurement of a further discriminating variable , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the momentum vector of a calorimeter cell , for zeus .",
    "these extensions are , however , at the expense of a significant non - diffractive dis background ( up to @xmath51 and @xmath94 , respectively ) . in each case",
    ", this background is estimated using the the colour - dipole model as implemented in the ariadne  4.03 program  @xcite , which reasonably reproduces the observed forward @xmath101 flows in non - diffractive interactions .",
    "the uncertainty on this background is estimated by changing the applied cuts or by using other monte carlo models and is up to 20% for large masses , @xmath5 , of the dissociated photon .",
    "the double dissociation contribution is estimated with similar uncertainties to the vector meson case .",
    "other systematic errors are similar to those for the @xmath81 analyses ( @xmath102 ) with additional acceptance uncertainties due to variations of the input diffractive monte carlo distributions .    in the presentation of the results ,",
    "the formalism changes  @xcite , reflecting an assumed underlying partonic description , and two orthogonal variables are determined : @xmath103 the momentum fraction of the pomeron within the proton and the momentum fraction of the struck quark within the pomeron , respectively . the structure function",
    "is then defined by analogy to that of the total @xmath104 cross section : @xmath105 where the contribution of @xmath106 and radiative corrections are neglected and an integration over the ( unmeasured ) @xmath8 variable is performed .",
    "the effect of neglecting @xmath106 corresponds to a relative reduction of the cross section at small  ( high @xmath7 ) which is always @xmath107 and therefore smaller than the typical measurement uncertainties ( @xmath53 ) .    as discussed above",
    ", a major uncertainty comes from the estimation of the non - diffractive background .",
    "this problem has been addressed in a different way in a further analysis by zeus  @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the mass spectrum , @xmath5 , is measured as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath22 , as shown in figure  6 for four representative intervals , where the measured mass is reconstructed in the calorimeter and corrected for energy loss but not for detector acceptance , resulting in the turnover at large @xmath5 .",
    "the diffractive data are observed as a low mass shoulder at low @xmath10 , which becomes increasingly apparent at higher @xmath10 .",
    "also shown in the figure are the estimates of the non - diffractive background based on ( a ) the ariadne monte carlo ( dotted histogram ) and ( b ) a direct fit to the data , discussed below .",
    "= 8.cm    the probability of producing a gap",
    "is exponentially suppressed as a function of the rapidity gap , and hence as a function of @xmath108 ) , for non - diffractive interactions .",
    "the slope of this exponential is directly related to the height of the plateau distribution of multiplicity in the region of rapidity where the subtraction is made .",
    "the data can thus be fitted to functions of the form @xmath109 , in the region where the detector acceptance is uniform , where @xmath64 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are determined from the fits . here",
    ", @xmath111 represents a first - order estimate of the diffractive contribution which is flat in @xmath108 ) .",
    "the important parameter is @xmath64 , which is determined to be @xmath112 in fits to each of the measured data intervals , compared to @xmath113 estimated from the ariadne monte carlo .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the background reflects various changes to the fits , but in each case the measured slope is incompatible with that of the monte carlo .",
    "this result in itself is interesting , since the fact that ariadne approximately reproduces the observed forward @xmath101 ( @xmath114 multiplicity ) flow but does not reproduce the measured @xmath64 slope suggests that significantly different correlations of the multiplicities are present in non - diffractive dis compared to the monte carlo expectations . also new in this analysis",
    "is that the diffractive monte carlo pompyt  1.0  @xcite has been tuned to the observed data contribution for low mass states , allowing the high @xmath115 region to be measured up to the kinematic limit ( @xmath116 ) and radiative corrections have been estimated in each interval ( @xmath102  @xcite ) .",
    "the virtual - photon proton cross sections measured at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath10 , measured in this analysis , can be converted to @xmath117 at fixed @xmath115 and @xmath118 .",
    "these results are shown in figure  7 as the zeus(bgd )  @xcite analysis , compared to the earlier h1  @xcite and zeus(bgmc )  @xcite analyses in comparable intervals of @xmath115 and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "the overall cross sections in each @xmath115 and @xmath22 interval are similar , however , the  dependences are different .",
    "as can be seen in figure  6 , the background estimates are significantly different which results in a systematic shift in the @xmath10 ( ) dependence at fixed @xmath119 ( @xmath115 ) and @xmath22 .",
    "= 10.cm    fits of the form @xmath120 are performed where the normalisation constants @xmath121 are allowed to differ in each @xmath122 interval .",

    "it should be noted that the ( 2@xmath134 ) systematic shift between the zeus(bgd ) and zeus(bgmc ) can be attributed to the method of background subtraction . whilst the h1 and zeus(bgmc ) analyses , based on monte carlo background subtraction , agree within errors , the zeus(bgd ) value is different from the h1 value at the 3@xmath134 level .",
    "the donnachie - landshoff prediction  @xcite is @xmath135 , after integration over an assumed @xmath8 dependence and taking into account shrinkage . while comparison with the h1 value indicates that this contribution is significant ,",
    "the possibility of additional contributions can not be neglected .",
    "taking the zeus(bgd ) value , this measurement is incompatible with the predicted soft pomeron behaviour at the 4@xmath134 level .",
    "estimates of the effect of @xmath136 made by assuming @xmath137 rather than @xmath138 result in @xmath127 increasing from 0.24 to 0.29 .",

    "the general conclusions from the @xmath115 dependence are that the pomeron has a predominantly hard structure , typically characterised by a symmetric @xmath142 dependence , but also containing an additional , significant contribution at low @xmath115 which has been fitted in the zeus analysis  @xcite .",
    "the virtual photon only couples directly to quarks , but the overall cross section can give indications only of the relative proportion of quarks and gluons within the pomeron , since the flux normalisation is somewhat arbitrary  @xcite . the @xmath22 behaviour is broadly scaling , consistent with a partonic structure of the pomeron . probing more deeply ,",
    "however , a characteristic logarithmic rise of @xmath140 is observed in all @xmath115 intervals .",
    "most significantly , at large @xmath115 a predominantly quark - like object would radiate gluons resulting in negative scaling violations as in the case of the large-@xmath82 ( @xmath143 ) behaviour of the proton .",

    "each probes the large @xmath145 structure of the pomeron with the jet and dis data , predominantly sampling the ( hard ) gluon and quark distributions , respectively . in figure",
    "9(b ) the preferred momentum fraction carried by the ( hard ) gluon , @xmath159 , is indicated by the overlapping region of the jet ( dark band ) and dis ( light band ) fits to the data .",
    "considering the systematics due to the non - diffractive background , modelled using the monte carlo models , a range of values consistent with @xmath160 can be estimated .",
    "the result depends on the assumption that the cross sections for both sets of data factorise with a universal flux , characterised by the same value of @xmath127 in this @xmath10 range , but does not assume the momentum sum rule .",
    "( a )    ( b )     +     +    so far we have only considered the case of small-@xmath8 diffraction with respect to the outgoing proton .",
    "further insight into the diffractive exchange process can be obtained by measurements of the rapidity gap between jets . here , a class of events is observed with little hadronic activity between the jets  @xcite .",
    "the jets have @xmath161  gev and are separated by a pseudorapidity interval ( @xmath162 ) of up to 4 units .",
    "the scale of the momentum transfer , @xmath8 , is not precisely defined but is of order @xmath163 .",
    "a gap is defined as the absence of particles with transverse energy greater than 300  mev between the jets .",
    "the fraction of events containing a gap is then measured as a function of @xmath162 , as shown in figure  10 .",
    "the fit indicates the sum of an exponential behaviour , as expected for non - diffractive processes and discussed in relation to the diffractive dis data , and a flat distribution expected for diffractive processes . at values of @xmath164 ,",
    "an excess is seen with a constant fraction over the expectation for non - diffractive exchange at @xmath165 .",
    "this can be interpreted as evidence for large-@xmath8 diffractive scattering .",
    "in fact , secondary interactions of the photon and proton remnant jets could fill in the gap and therefore the underlying process could play a more significant rle .",
    "the size of this fraction is relatively large when compared to a similar analysis by d0 and cdf where a constant fraction at @xmath166 is observed  @xcite .",
    "the relative probability may differ due to the higher @xmath10 values of the tevatron compared to hera or , perhaps , due to differences in the underlying @xmath71 and @xmath15 interactions .",
    "= 6.cm      the advent of the leading proton spectrometers ( lps ) at hera is especially important in these diffractive measurements , since internal cross checks of the measurements as a function of @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath22 can ultimately be performed and underlying assumptions can be questioned experimentally . only in these measurements",
    "can we positively identify the diffracted proton and hence substantially reduce uncertainties on the non - diffractive and double dissociation backgrounds .",
    "however , new uncertainties are introduced due to the need for precise understanding of the beam optics and relative alignment of the detectors . reduced statistical precision",
    "also results due to the geometrical acceptance of the detectors ( @xmath28  6% ) . in figure  11(a ) , various observed distributions are shown for 240 events selected from the dis data , with @xmath167  gev@xmath41 .",
    "the momentum distribution clearly indicates a significant diffractive peak at @xmath168  gev above the non - diffractive background and the observed @xmath119 and @xmath10 distributions are well described by the nz monte carlo  @xcite . the distribution of @xmath115 versus @xmath118 indicates a significant fraction of events at small @xmath169 which are difficult to access using the experimental techniques described earlier .",
    "the measurements are currently being analysed , but a preliminary result on the @xmath8-dependence is shown in figure  11(b ) , measured in a relatively high observed mass interval , @xmath170  gev , at relatively low @xmath22 .",
    "the slope can be characterised by a single exponential fit with @xmath171 .",
    "this is somewhat high compared to the value of @xmath172 expected for a predominantly hard pomeron but lies within the range of expectations of @xmath173 .",
    "however , before drawing conclusions , we should perhaps wait for further results on the general dependences measured in the lps .",
    "( a )    ( b )     +     +",
    "the soft pomeron no longer describes @xmath174 diffractive data measured at hera . as the photon virtuality and/or",
    "the vector meson mass increases a new dependence on @xmath7 emerges .",
    "as we investigate the pomeron more closely , a new type of dynamical pomeron may begin to play a rle : a dynamical pomeron whose structure is being measured in dis .",
    "these data are consistent with a partonic description of the exchanged object which may be described by pqcd .",
    "the experimental work focuses on extending the lever arms and increasing the precision in @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath22 in order to explore this new structure .",
    "before more precise tests can be made , further theoretical and experimental input is required to reduce the uncertainties due to non - diffractive backgrounds and proton dissociation as well as the treatment of @xmath106 and radiative corrections .",
    "the results presented in this talk are a summary of significant developments in the study of diffraction at hera during the last year .",
    "the financial support of the desy directorate and pparc allowed me to participate in this research , whilst based at desy , for which i am very grateful .",
