    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are one of the most powerful distance indicators for distant galaxies in the cosmic expansion dominated field ( @xmath16 mpc ) .",
    "three advantages of sne ia - a bright peak luminosity , a small luminosity dispersion , and a homogeneity in the universe - have enabled us to investigate the cosmic expansion rate ( @xmath17 ) @xcite and the cosmic acceleration rate ( @xmath18 ) @xcite . although great progress has been made over the last two decades , more accurate calibration of peak luminosity of sne ia is needed to derive more accurate values of cosmological parameters .",
    "recently , two large projects , supernovae and @xmath17 for the equation of state ( sh0es , @xcite ) and carnegie hubble program ( chp , @xcite ) , have been working on the calibration of sne ia to improve the measurement of cosmological parameters .",
    "they performed the luminosity calibration of sne ia based on the cepheid distance estimates of 8 sne ia host galaxies and derived similar values of the hubble constant : @xmath19 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13@xcite and @xmath20 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 @xcite .",

    "this is called `` the hubble tension '' , one of the most critical issues in modern cosmology .",
    "in addition , recent studies of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) in the range of redshift combined with sne ia data presented similar values to those from the cmbr analysis @xcite .",

    "it is noted that , although exposure times of ngc 4038/39 are much shorter than those of ngc 5584 , the recovery rates are higher in the same magnitude range . this can be explained as follows .",
    "first , the field used in the analysis of ngc 4038/39 is much farther from the center of the host galaxy than that of ngc 5584 , so that the expected stellar density is much lower .",
    "second , ngc 4038/39 was observed with acs / wfc , which has higher sensitivity than the wfc3/uvis at longer wavelengths of @xmath112 400 nm .",

    "random uncertainties increase gradually , being proportional to the input @xmath1-band magnitudes .",
    "systematic offsets are noted . for @xmath138 in ( b ) and ( e ) , @xmath139 values are positive .",

    "the @xmath38 fields used in this study cover the tidal tail in ngc 4038/39 , and the disk and bulge in ngc 5584 . therefore the color - magnitude diagrams of these fields show various populations of stars , such as young main sequence , blue and red super giant , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and rgb stars .",
    "these mixed populations increase uncertainties in determining the trgb . in order to reduce the contamination due to multiple stellar populations and to sample the rgb population as much as possible , we selected regions with the lowest sky background level , avoiding spiral arms and tidal tails .",

    "third , the bluer rgb stars are relatively less affected by the host galaxy reddening .",

    "the corresponding distance modulus is @xmath243 , which is in agreement with our best estimate , @xmath4 , within an uncertainty .",
    "thus , within the 0.16 magnitude difference between our best estimate and that of @xcite , 0.06 mag comes from field selection , 0.05 mag comes from the trgb color selection , and 0.05 mag comes from the measurement error . our estimate is consistent with the cepheid estimate by @xcite ( @xmath190 ) .",
