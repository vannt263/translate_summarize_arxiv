    "the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) approach focuses on the issue of gauge copies in the landau gauge .",
    "gribov signalled in his seminal work @xcite that the landau gauge condition , @xmath0 is ambiguous : there exist gauge equivalent configurations @xmath1 which also obey @xmath2 .",
    "examples of gauge copies are provided by the zero modes of the faddeev - popov ( fp ) operator , which enters the quantization formula of yang - mills theories .",
    "indeed , given an infinitesimal gauge transformation connecting @xmath3 with @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath4 , it is clear that @xmath5 is fulfilled when @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the fp operator .",
    "we recall that the fp action in the landau gauge for a @xmath8-dimensional euclidean gauge theory , with @xmath9 , reads @xmath10with @xmath11 the classical yang - mills action .",
    "expression enjoys the well - known brst symmetry , generated by the nilpotent operator @xmath12 , @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 for the partition function , we can write @xmath15we introduced the notational shorthand @xmath16 denoting all the fields present in the action , with @xmath17 the usual fp measure .",
    "gribov proposed to restrict the domain of integration to the subspace @xmath18 , where the hermitian operator @xmath19 is positive definite .",
    "more precisely , we define the gribov region as @xmath20 .",
    "we recognize that configurations @xmath21 are relative minima of the functional @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary , @xmath24 , of @xmath18 is called the ( first ) gribov horizon .",
    "it was shown with increasing rigor that @xmath18 is convex , bounded in all directions in field space , and that every gauge field has at least one gauge equivalent representant in @xmath18 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the inverse of the fp operator , or equivalently the ghost propagator with external gauge field , @xmath25 , can be used to implement the restriction to @xmath18 , as done semiclassically by gribov .",
    "following @xcite , we can write @xmath26at lowest order , it can be shown that @xmath27 is a decreasing function of @xmath28 @xcite , hence one can impose @xmath29condition , known as the gribov no - pole condition , implies that the ghost propagator @xmath25 has no poles at finite nonvanishing @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , positivity of @xmath25 ensures that the gribov horizon @xmath24 is not crossed .",
    "as done by gribov @xcite , the no - pole condition can be embodied into the partition function using a @xmath30-function - function can be can be replaced by a @xmath30-function , see @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath31 later on , zwanziger @xcite was able to implement the no - pole condition to all orders . relying on the equivalence between the microcanonical and the canonical boltzmann ensemble",
    "( see also section ii ) , he was able to show that the partition function has to be replaced by @xmath32 where the zwanziger horizon function reads @xmath33the mass parameter @xmath34 is determined by a gap equation , commonly called the horizon condition @xmath35where @xmath36 is calculated with @xmath37 , i.e. with the measure @xmath38 .",
    "the factor @xmath39 in the r.h.s . was obtained @xcite by determining the lowest eigenvalue of the fp operator .",
    "working out the condition at lowest order reproduces the gribov result @xcite .",
    "the action corresponding to the partition function contains the _ nonlocal _ horizon term .",
    "to arrive at a workable quantum model , it was shown @xcite that can be put in an equivalent _ local _ form by introducing a set of complex conjugate commuting variables , @xmath40 , and anticommuting ones , @xmath41 , so that we finally obtain the gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath42 the horizon condition is translated as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the effective action , defined as @xmath45 .",
    "this can be easily checked , given that we take @xmath46 .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath34 turns out to be proportional to @xmath47 , and as such it can give rise to nonperturbative corrections .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the restriction to the region @xmath18 is a highly nontrivial operation , which goes beyond perturbation theory . at the perturbative level , the ghost propagator stays positive .",
    "we are thus far from the horizon and nothing happens .",
    "it is only at lower momenta , where normal perturbation theory starts to fail , that the fields begin to feel the restriction to @xmath18 .",
    "having brought the action in standard local form , we have all the usual concepts and machinery of local quantum field theory to our disposal .",
    "a first important property of is its renormalizability to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "hence , the restriction to @xmath48 makes perfect sense at the quantum level , and finite results are found , consistent with the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "we stress here that the action , with the horizon condition implemented , is nothing else than the correct extension to all orders of the usual yang - mills action , supplemented with the landau gauge fixing , in the presence of a nontrivial boundary condition , being the no - pole condition . in this fashion , it is assured that we have taken care of a certain amount of gauge copies , including those related to the zero modes of @xmath19 .",
    "notice that this does not mean that the gribov issue has been completely solved .",
    "it is known that @xmath18 still contains copies , related to the fact that @xmath49 can have many relative minima starting from the same @xmath3 .",
    "a further restriction is needed , keeping only gauge configurations that are absolute minima of @xmath50 ; the latter define the fundamental modular region ( fmr ) @xmath51 .",
    "evidently , the extra fields,@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54,@xmath55 ) , can influence the dynamics of the theory in a nontrivial fashion dudal:2007cw .",
    "these fields arise as a consequence of the presence of the gribov horizon . as such",
    ", they can give rise to additional nonperturbative effects .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we have provided evidence of the existence of a dimension 2 condensate , @xmath56 , in @xmath57 .",
    "a posteriori , this is not that surprising , given that the restriction to @xmath48 introduces the mass scale @xmath58 into the theory , and that the horizon condition can be reexpressed at the local level as @xmath59 , i.e. a dimension 2 condensate for @xmath57 .",
    "nontrivial condensates are an important source of nonperturbative effects in gauge theories , hence the general interest in their study .",
    "in particular , dimension 2 condensates attracted a lot of attention in recent years , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "in the current case , the operator @xmath60 can be added to the theory in a way that preserves renormalizability @xcite , which is already a remarkable feature , indicative of its possible relevance .",
    "we studied the effects of this condensate using variational perturbation theory , and found that the gluon propagator as @xmath61 . ]",
    "does not vanish at zero momentum ( @xmath62 ) , that the ghost propagator behaves like @xmath63 at small momenta , and that there is a violation of positivity in the gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "any of these findings is in good agreement with _ all _ most recent lattice data , obtained at previously unseen large volumes @xcite .",
    "also certain results based on schwinger - dyson ( sd ) and/or functional renormalization group ( frg ) equations are consistent with these data , see e.g. @xcite . without taking into account the effects related to @xmath56 , the gz action also leads to the positivity violation of the gluon propagator , however with @xmath64 , and an infrared enhanced ghost .",
    "these latter two results are no longer supported by lattice data .",
    "hence , it seems crucial to take into account additional nonperturbative effects related to the restriction to the region @xmath48",
    "( i.e. the boundary condition ) to allow for consistency between the analytical gz results and most recent lattice predictions .",
    "the interpretation of the analytical @xcite and the lattice results of @xcite was challenged in papers like @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the ghost propagator must be infrared enhanced to ensure confinement , whereby only colorless states are physical . these statements are based on the kugo - ojima ( ko ) analysis of gauge theories @xcite .",
    "this analysis relies on the operator formalism , and it has been shown that , given a globally well - defined brst charge @xmath65 , the color charge @xmath66 is a brst exact variation , @xmath67 , if the gluon propagator contains no massless poles . the color charge @xmath66 is then well - defined only if the ko confinement criterion holds @xmath68with @xmath69 defined through the following green function @xmath70 in minkowski space .",
    "@xmath71 stands for the expectation value taken with the fp action , while @xmath72 for the transverse projector . using the nilpotent brst charge @xmath65",
    ", one can invoke its cohomology to define the physical subspace , and by means of @xmath67 , conclude that physical states can not carry color .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first of all , in the ko framework @xcite , the existence of a globally well - defined brst charge is _",
    "assumed_. thus , the issue of the ( non)existence of a nonperturbatively valid brst symmetry is not explicitly faced .",
    "secondly , the link between the brst charge @xmath73 and global color charge @xmath74 is made using the action , i.e. by employing the usual fp gauge fixed action .",
    "as such , the gribov problem is simply not addressed .",
    "it is worth noticing that kugo and ojima did not impose the criterion , but they derived it as a condition to be checked / calculated .",
    "though , nowadays , in functional formalisms as in @xcite , the criterion is used as _",
    "input_. kugo showed in @xcite that , in the landau gauge , one can rewrite the ghost propagator @xmath75 meaning that the criterion is equivalent to an infrared enhanced ghost .",
    "the ghost enhancement is then imposed as a boundary condition in order to favor the so - called scaling type solution of the sd and/or frg equations @xcite .",
    "let us already draw attention to the close similarity existing between the no - pole condition and the criterion .",
    "imposing is related to @xmath76 by making the gauge field dynamical and performing the corresponding path integration . ]",
    "@xmath77 exactly corresponds to @xmath78 .",
    "we want to show that the constraint @xmath78 can be implemented directly into the theory , by appropriately modifying the measure one starts from .",
    "we shall see that the resulting action will be exactly the same as the gz action .",
    "this has several interesting consequences which we will discuss in section iii .",
    "we shall first give an overview of some results from thermodynamics we intend to employ .",
    "we consider a discrete system , whose hamiltonian is @xmath79 , with @xmath80 degrees of freedom .",
    "the averages in the microcanonical ensemble are constructed out of @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents the classical phase space and @xmath83 stands for the constant energy of the system .",
    "averages in the microcanonical ensemble are defined by @xmath84 . in order to establish the equivalence between the microcanonical and the ( boltzmann ) canonical ensemble",
    "we rewrite the quantity @xmath85 in the following form @xmath86 it can be shown that , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 fixed , the saddle point approximation becomes exact .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an overview of the proof .",
    "so , @xmath89from eq.@xmath90 it follows that @xmath91this is the gap equation determining the critical parameter @xmath92 .",
    "analogously , it can also be shown that @xcite @xmath93 for the average of any quantity @xmath94 .",
    "starting from and performing lorentz and color contractions and taking the @xmath95 limit , we can write @xmath96after passing to euclidean space , as in any functional or lattice approach .",
    "@xmath97 denotes the spacetime volume .",
    "the identification between @xmath98 and @xmath99 can be easily proven using the path integral . after discarding terms which are total derivatives",
    ", one easily sees that the quantity in the l.h.s . of is , up to the sign , the zwanziger horizon function @xmath100 .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath101we observe that the ko condition can not be realized with the standard fp measure @xmath17 , otherwise we would have @xmath102which would contradict zwanziger s result ( [ part3 ] ) , obtained by restricting the path integral to the gribov region @xmath18 .",
    "we now implement the ko criterion @xmath78 as a boundary condition , amounting to start from the modified measure @xmath103which clearly implements @xmath104 , or equivalently @xmath78 .",
    "we are thus led to consider the partition function @xmath105expression @xmath106 defines a microcanonical ensemble .",
    "since we are working in a continuum field theory , we are working in the thermodynamic limit , hence we have an equivalence with a boltzmann canonical ensemble as outlined in the previous section . using analogous arguments as there ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath107where the mass parameter @xmath34 follows from the gap equation @xmath108which is the analogue of . we conclude that we can consistently encode the boundary condition at the level of the action , which turns out to be identical to the gz action , eq .. of course , we can localize it into the form , with corresponding local formulation of the gap equation .",
    "naively , one might already expect that the introduction of a nontrivial boundary condition can seriously influence the dynamics of the theory .",
    "one of our main points is to stress that one should introduce the boundary condition into the theory from the beginning , to fully grasp all its nontrivial aspects .",
    "having at our disposal an action automatically implementing the boundary condition , we can study an important aspect : the symmetries of the theory in the presence of the boundary . in principle , imposing a boundary could jeopardize certain symmetries of the original action . we have already shown in @xcite that placing a boundary in field space at the first gribov horizon breaks the conventional brst symmetry .",
    "the practical implementation of the horizon by means of the gz formulation confirms this , as @xmath109 .",
    "we notice that the brst generator has a natural extension to the extra fields @xmath110 , given by @xmath111forming 2 pairs of brst doublets . in the absence of the gz restriction or equivalently of the ko criterion ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath112 , we are then assured that these fields are trivial in the brst cohomology , thus completely decoupling from the physical subspace @xcite .",
    "let us come to another important statement .",
    "if gribov copies are taken into account  la gz , which is equivalent to imposing the ko criterion as we have verified in the previous section , the precise meaning of the ko confinement criterion becomes unclear .",
    "since the brst symmetry is broken , one can no longer simply use it to define the physical subspace .",
    "it is sometimes mentioned in the literature that there might be a nonperturbative , globally well - defined brst charge @xmath113 , and it is this @xmath113 ko is referring to fischer:2008uz , sternbeck:2008mv .",
    "we can not exclude this possibility , but this is a highly nontrivial statement and , obviously , it asks for a proof . at present , we are unaware of any such proof . even if the charge @xmath113 would be known , the ko analysis would need to be reworked from the start , as it explicitly relies on the fp action and conventional brst symmetry . simply stating that @xmath113 must exist in order to define the physical subspace analogously to what is done at perturbative level , does , in our opinion , not solve the problem .",
    "also , the relation between a new brst charge @xmath113 and the global color charge would need to be reestablished , if any relation exists to begin with .",
    "one can speculate that it might be possible to modify @xmath12 into @xmath114 , such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "however , such a possibility can be easily disproved .",
    "indeed , as @xmath34 has mass dimension 1 , and by keeping in mind that the brst generator @xmath12 does not affect the dimension of the fields , it is impossible to introduce extra @xmath34-dependent terms in the brst transformation of the fields while preserving locality , lorentz covariance and global @xmath117 structure",
    ". let us briefly return to the functional sd ( frg ) approaches . now that a renormalizable action has been constructed , which implements the desired boundary condition explicitly , one can write down the corresponding sd ( frg ) equations and try to solve them , given that the gap equation must be solved simultaneously .",
    "we expect that different kinds of solutions , similar to those found in @xcite , will emerge . a way to distinguish between them",
    "could be based on selecting the most stable solution , i.e. the one with the lowest corresponding vacuum energy .",
    "we notice that there is still a lot of information available about the action , e.g. nonrenormalization properties typical of the landau gauge , a renormalizable softly broken slavnov - taylor identity , etc .",
    "we conclude that in the current spirit of using the ko condition as in fischer:2008uz , sternbeck:2008mv , there is no clear connection between the ko criterion @xmath78 and the highly nontrivial issue of confinement .",
    "all that one can say is that there is a violation of positivity in the gluon propagator , which is indicative of confinement , but certainly not a proof of it .",
    "also , in the light of our previous results , we disagree with the statement made in maas:2008ri , fischer:2008uz , sternbeck:2008mv about the fact that the sd(frg ) solution with an infrared enhanced ghost propagator would refer to the absolute landau gauge , i.e. to the restriction to the fmr @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , at present , a way to implement the restriction to the fmr @xmath51 remains completely unknown .",
    "moreover , we remind that the recent lattice data have given quite clear evidence about the fact that the ghost propagator is not enhanced in the infrared , within the current accuracy of implementing the landau gauge as the minimum of the functional @xmath22 , @xmath23 cucchieri:2007md .",
    "even if in the future more powerful algorithms would bring the simulations closer to the fmr @xmath51 , the ghost propagator will not get more enhanced than before , on the contrary cucchieri:1997dx .",
    "moreover , we have shown in this letter that the ko boundary condition is equivalent with the gz framework , which explicitly refers to the restriction to the gribov region @xmath18 .",
    "this is irrespective of the fact that the ghost is enhanced or not , implementing ko breaks the conventional brst symmetry , and refers to @xmath18 , not to @xmath51 .",
    "we wish to underline that implementing the boundary as in eqs . and will not necessarily give rise to an infrared enhanced ghost .",
    "additional nontrivial quantum effects can combine with the boundary effect , we refer for instance to the effects of the operator @xmath118 in the case under study",
    ". we can make the analogy with spontaneous symmetry breaking : although the starting action in that case enjoys a certain symmetry , nonperturbative quantum effects can induce a shift from the symmetric , but unstable , vacuum , causing qualitative and quantitative effects in the theory .    in conclusion , we hope that this letter has clarified the relation between the ko and gz framework .",
    "our main result is expressed by eqs . and , which show that the ko and gz frameworks are equivalent , provided the ko boundary condition",
    "is properly taken into account from the beginning .",
    "the conventional brst operator suffers from a soft breaking , which relies precisely on the implementation of the boundary condition .",
    "some ingredients in certain formalisms , which we have tried to outline , have thus to be considered as assumptions rather than as proofs . in particular",
    ", the precise relation between implementing the ko criterion and confinement remains to be clarified .",
    "one of the challenges lying ahead is how to define what the relevant physical operators are in the kogz framework , if there is no ( local ) nilpotent brst symmetry generator found .",
