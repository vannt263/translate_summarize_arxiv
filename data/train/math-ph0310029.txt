    "the goal of the present paper is to provide a more detailed analysis of the pauli operator describing a spin-1/2 charged particle under the influence of two aharonov - bohm ( ab ) fluxes @xcite .",

    "what follows we call the intersection points of the fluxes with the plane vortices .    to define the pauli hamiltonian with singular fluxes we use the aharonov - casher decomposition @xcite .",
    "it makes it possible to introduce the two diagonal components of the pauli operator corresponding to spin up and down as the unique selfadjoint operators associated to appropriate quadratic forms . since the magnetic field vanishes outside of the vortices the two components of the pauli hamiltonian as well as the spinless ab hamiltonian are selfadjoint extensions of the same symmetric operator . in the case of one ab flux",
    "all the selfadjoint extensions are known to be defined by appropriate boundary conditions at the vortex @xcite .",
    "thus our first goal was to distinguish the boundary conditions defining the two components of the pauli hamiltonian .",
    "the second goal was to construct a basis in the deficiency subspaces in the two - vortex case . in this case",
    "as well the two diagonal components of the pauli hamiltonian and the spinless hamiltonian are selfadjoint extensions of a common symmetric operator .",
    "we show that the deficiency indices of this symmetric operator are @xmath0 .",
    "the construction is based on the observation that the coefficients @xmath1 standing at singular terms in the asymptotic expansion in the variable @xmath2 at a vortex of the green function @xmath3 belong to the deficiency subspace with spectral parameter @xmath4 . here",
    "we make use of the explicit knowledge of the spinless two - vortex green function @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the next and final goal which naturally follows is a construction of the two - vortex green function for the pauli hamiltonian with the aid of the krein s formula .",
    "even this problem is solved explicitly .",
    "surprisingly many features can be again derived from the asymptotic analysis near a vortex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we summarize some basic facts and formulae concerning the spinless ab hamiltonian with one and two vortices . in section  [ sec : the - pauli - hamiltonian ] we introduce the pauli operator with one and two ab fluxes and derive the boundary conditions at a vortex defining the spin up and down components of the pauli hamiltonian . in section  [ sec : asymptotic - behaviour ]",
    "we provide a basic asymptotic analysis near a vortex of functions from the deficiency subspaces as well as that of the spinless green function . in section  [ sec : deficiency - subspaces ]",

    "the ab hamiltonian with one vortex and describing a spinless particle , @xmath5 , was introduced in ref .   and studied in a long series of papers by many authors .",
    "for example , one can consult ref .",
    "for some mathematical details .",
    "it acts in @xmath6 and is nothing but the selfadjoint operator associated to the closure of the positive quadratic form @xmath7 defined on the space of test functions @xmath8 . in other words , @xmath9 is the friedrichs extension of the corresponding symmetric operator with the domain @xmath8 .",
    "owing to the gauge equivalence we can assume that @xmath10 .",
    "we shall use the polar coordinates @xmath11 with the angle @xmath12 .",
    "this implies a cut along the negative @xmath13 half - axis .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to apply the unitary operator @xmath14 and work with the unitarily equivalent operator @xmath15 in particular this unitary transformation is useful when constructing the green function .",
    "this means that @xmath16 formally , as a differential operator , @xmath17 the domain of @xmath18 is determined by the boundary conditions at the cut , namely @xmath19 in addition , one should take care about boundary conditions at the vortex . as analyzed in refs .  , the domain of @xmath9 is characterized by the boundary condition @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath21 the same is true for @xmath22 , namely the boundary condition at the vortex reads @xmath23 .",
    "the generalized eigenfunctions of @xmath18 , @xmath24 form a complete normalized set , @xmath25 this makes it possible to write down the green function and the propagator as integrals , @xmath26 and@xmath27 they are related by the laplace transform , @xmath28    starting from ( [ eq : propagatorjj ] ) one can derive the following formula for the propagator@xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the phase factor in front of the first term depends on whether @xmath31 the laplace transformation results in a formula for the green function , @xmath32 the second term on the rhs of ( [ eq : finalgreenfce ] ) can be given still another form with the aid of the identity @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the two - vortex ab hamiltonian @xmath5 is the unique self - adjoint operator associated to the quadratic form    [ eq : quadratformtwovort ] @xmath68 where @xmath69    again , owing to the gauge equivalence , we can assume that @xmath70 .    also in this case one can pass to a unitarily equivalent formulation .",
    "the plane is cut along two half - lines , @xmath71 the values @xmath72 correspond to the two sides of the cut @xmath73 and similarly for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "the unitarily equivalent hamiltonian @xmath18 is formally equal to @xmath76 and is determined by the boundary conditions along the cut , @xmath77 in addition , one should impose a boundary condition at the vortex , namely @xmath78 .",
    "a formula for the green function of the hamiltonian @xmath18 is known also in the case of two vortices @xcite .",
    "for a couple of points @xmath79 we set @xmath80 depending on whether the segment @xmath81 does not intersect @xmath73 , or @xmath81 intersects @xmath73 and @xmath2 lies in the lower half - plane , or @xmath81 intersects @xmath73 and @xmath2 lies in the upper half - plane .",

    "more precisely , the operators are defined as the unique selfadjoint operators associated respectively to the positive quadratic forms    @xmath108    with their natural maximal domains of definition .    since the magnetic field vanishes on @xmath109 the operators @xmath110",

    "the method used to derive the boundary conditions was inspired by the description of point interactions in the plane given in ref .  .",

    "@xmath136 is unique and @xmath137 .",
    "we are going to apply this prescription to the quadratic forms ( [ eq : qformsqpm ] ) .",
    "this amounts to integration by parts .",
