    "this paper deals with the motion of three bodies in the plane where the only force being considered is the gravitational force .",
    "we will assume that the units have been changed so that the gravitational constant is 1 , the mass of the first body is @xmath8 and the mass of the second body is @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the first body moves according to the formula @xmath10 and the second body moves according to the formula @xmath11 .",
    "the motion of these two bodies is known as the circular solution of the two body problem .",
    "now , let us assume that the third body has a mass @xmath12 so small that it does not affect the motion of the other two bodies .",
    "it follows that if the third body moves according to the formula @xmath13 , then the function @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfy the following system of differential equations ,    @xmath16    the problem given by the differential equation above is known as the planar , circular , restricted three body problem , hereafter , pcr3bp .",
    "we will be considering periodic solutions of the pcr3bp .",
    "it is well - known that the period of a periodic solution of the pcr3bp must be a multiple of @xmath17 , @xcite .",
    "when we change the coordinate system so that it rotates along with the motion of the first two bodies , that is , if we consider the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 instead of @xmath14 and @xmath15 using the relations @xmath20    then , it follows that the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfy the following system of differential equations    @xmath21    where ,    @xmath22    an important aspect of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is that it is an autonomous system , and , for this reason , the period of a periodic solution does not have to be a multiple of @xmath17 . regarding the relation between the period of periodic solutions of both systems of differential equations we have that every periodic solution of the pcr3bp defines a periodic solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , and a @xmath0-periodic solutions of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) defines a periodic solution of the pcr3bp only when @xmath23 is a rational number . a detailed discussion on the periodic solutions of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "a direct computation shows that for every solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) we have that    @xmath24    where @xmath5 is a constant called the jacobian integral @xcite .",
    "if follows that every solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) must be contained in the region    @xmath25    we point out that since the function @xmath26 is not defined on the set @xmath27 , then , we are not considering these two points to be part of @xmath28 .    in this paper",
    "we prove that if a regular simple closed curve @xmath29 is a @xmath0 periodic solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , and the region @xmath3 enclosed by this closed curve is contained in the region @xmath30 , then , for some integer @xmath2 we have that    @xmath31    the choice of @xmath32 depends on the orientation of the periodic solution .",
    "we extend the result to situations when the curve goes several times around the point @xmath33 or around the point @xmath34 .",
    "the proofs of the main results in this paper are very basic since they follow from the stokes theorem . despite the simplicity of these results",
    ", the author considers that they are interesting . the key result that allows to use the stokes theorem is lemma [ le ] .",
    "the author found the formula in this lemma while he was trying to find an explicit solution of the restricted three body problem .",
    "he was trying to find the tread - mill sled of the solution , which is a notion that he has used to explain : the profile curve of surfaces in the euclidean space with constant mean curvature and helicoidal symmetry @xcite , the profile curve of minimal surface in the euclidean space and helicoidal symmetry , @xcite , and the shape of ramp with the property that a block will slide down with constant speed @xcite .",
