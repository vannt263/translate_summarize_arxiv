    "one of the motivations is the possibility of producing entangled electrons resulting from splitting of cooper pairs .",

    "the signatures of current correlations indicating the entanglement have been experimentally seen in devices with direct contact between two normal and one superconducting lead  @xcite or with those where leads were contacted _ via _ two or three quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the multiterminal hybrid structures  @xcite are subject of recent studies , both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite .",
    "the detailed understanding of these novel systems is very important as the effective use of the devices relies on the precise knowledge of the effects of interactions on the currents in the system  @xcite .    in structures with quantum dot(s ) and at least one superconducting lead one encounters various energy scales like temperature @xmath0 , bias voltage @xmath1 , superconducting gap @xmath2 , effective couplings @xmath3 between the quantum dot(s ) and electrodes and charging energy @xmath4 . depending on their relation there exist various transport regimes . of particular interest",
    "is the transport between the superconductor and the rest of the system . at bias voltages exceeding the superconducting gap or at high temperatures the single particle transport dominates , while for @xmath5",
    "the andreev scattering  @xcite is the dominant transport mechanism .",
    "the detailed analysis of the effect of coulomb interactions on the dot on the andreev transport in a three terminal device with single quantum dot is our primary goal here .",
    "we start with exactly solvable case of non - interacting dot and go through coulomb blockade regime of transport ending up with kondo correlated state . in the paper a three - terminal device ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) with a superconducting electrode and two normal metallic electrodes connected via a quantum dot is considered .",
    "we assume that the superconducting gap is the largest energy scale .",
    "the coulomb blockade is analyzed by means of hubbard i approximation and we go beyond this approximation using equation of motion method  @xcite and iterative perturbation theory  @xcite ( also known as modified second order perturbation theory  @xcite ) .",
    "the superconducting correlations are induced in the quantum dot by the proximity effect to the superconducting lead .",
    "the cooper pair injected from the superconducting lead to the dot either goes to one of the normal leads or splits and one of the electrons enters left ( l ) lead and other the right ( r ) one eventually retaining the singlet character of their state . in the reverse process",
    "an electron from a normal lead enters the superconductor leaving the hole behind in the same or other lead .    in three",
    "terminal device one distinguishes two different andreev processes . in the direct andreev reflection ( dar )",
    "two electrons entering the superconductor and the back - scattered hole are from the same lead while in crossed andreev reflection ( car ) electrons stem from different normal leads .",
    "these non - local processes ( car ) are a potential source of entangled particles as they result from a singlet state of the cooper pair .",
    "the processes competing with car are the single electron transfers ( et ) between both normal electrodes . as",
    "the quantitative understanding of this competition is a prerequisite of the entangler based on quantum dot devices and the main goal of the paper , we shall quantify the competition by the non local differential conductance relating the current in the right lead flowing in response to the voltage in the left lead .",
    "we have found that the coulomb interactions generally suppress car processes in the large range of bias voltages .",
    "however , there remain regions in the vicinity of the andreev bound states  @xcite where the car processes dominate the transport and the total non - local conductance is negative indicating entanglement of pairs of separated electrons : one of them entering the left and the other one the right normal electrode .",
    "the most interesting finding is that these subtle quantum correlations are observed in the kondo state , where the non - local conductance dominates over single electron transfer processes .",
    "this result agrees with the full counting statistics of two quantum dots in a three terminal device  @xcite , which indicated the possibility of observing positive current cross - correlation in a kondo regime of a hybrid structure .",
    "our calculations have shown that the effect exists and we predict its observation in a device with a single quantum dot .",
    "we note by passing that the related hybrid structures consisting of a quantum dot and one normal but two superconducting electrodes allow study of the interplay between the josephson effect and coulomb correlations  @xcite . in a related work the systems similar to that studied here consisting of quantum dot contacted to normal",
    ", superconducting and ferromagnetic electrodes have been recently proposed to be an effective source of pure spin currents  @xcite .",

    "the differential conductances of the system with non - interacting quantum dot are calculated and discussed in section iii .",
