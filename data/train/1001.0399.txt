    "the prospects for asteroseismology of red - giant stars have increased significantly with the launch of _ kepler _ @xcite in march 2009 and corot @xcite in december 2006 .",
    "these satellites provide uninterrupted long time series of high - precision photometry for a large sample of stars . among these stars",
    "are many red giants , allowing for both statistical analyses as well as detailed individual studies .",
    "corot data have already revealed the presence of nonradial oscillation modes in red giants @xcite and have given rise to a population synthesis study @xcite .",
    "the currently available _ kepler _ data reveal clear solar - like high radial overtone p - mode oscillations in a large sample of red giants , extending in luminosity from the red clump to the bottom of the giant branch @xcite .    for in - depth studies , including detailed stellar modeling , accurate stellar parameters are needed .",
    "red giants of different masses occupy a narrow region in the h - r diagram , which results in relatively large errors when estimating the mass from measured classical parameters , such as effective temperature , surface gravity and luminosity , and from evolutionary tracks .",
    "a better estimate can be obtained from the characteristic frequencies of solar - like oscillations in these stars and their frequency separations , either through modeling or through scaling relations @xcite .",
    "here we use a modeling approach and scaling relations to compute an asteroseismic mass and radius .",
    "eclipsing binary systems provide the primary method for measuring masses and radii of stars . however , the probability of observing an eclipsing system is low , because of the geometrical restriction that the system has to be viewed close to the orbital plane .",
    "we report here the discovery of a pulsating red giant in an eclipsing binary system observed by _",
    "this star was found using automated variability classification methods to the targets of the asteroseismology program of _ kepler _ @xcite .",
    "photometric data for kic8410637 ( tyc 3130 - 2385 ) have been taken with _",
    "kepler _ during the commissioning run ( q0 ) from 2009 may 2 through 11 , and the following first science run ( q1 ) of 33.5d .",
    "we present results based on these combined time series of about 40d .",
    "this star has a magnitude of 10.77 mag in the _ kepler _ bandpass and was selected by the _ kepler",
    "_ asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for long - cadence observations .",
    "the time series data have a 29.4-min cadence and show both solar - like oscillations in the frequency regime expected for a red giant , and an eclipse ( see fig .",
    "[ obs ] ) .",
    "this star has also been part of the tres - lyr1 ground - based survey @xcite from which time series photometry with a time span of 75d are at our disposal . in these data",
    "no eclipse is visible , while the primary and possibly the secondary eclipse ( depth predicted in section 6 ) would have been detected , had they occurred during the time span of the observations .",
    "the fact that the primary is not seen in the tres data implies that the period is longer than the duration of the tres observations .",
    "this star was also observed photometrically by the superwasp cameras @xcite for 100 days in 2007 and for 90 days in 2008 .",
    "there is a suspicion of a secondary eclipse , but no primary eclipse has been observed during these periods , which have some gaps due to weather conditions .",
    "observations for kic8410637 are also available from the all sky automated survey ( asas ) @xcite , in which there are three points that have lower flux than the majority",
    ". these points might be due to the eclipse , which would imply an orbital period of about 380d or a submultiple thereof . unfortunately , there are too few points , and their uncertainty is too large to draw firm conclusions .    additionally , we checked whether we could put more constraints on the period from the time stamps of the data we have at our disposal .",
    "we determined which periods would have led us to miss primary eclipses because of a lack of observations .",
    "we would have missed all eclipses for an orbital period of about 135 , 220 , 253 , 261 , 270 and 295 days .",
    "all other possible periods are longer than the 380 days , mentioned above .       from the orbital velocity of the secondary , we computed the period for a circular orbit , which would be shorter than half the total time span of the tres data and we should have seen an occultation in those data .",
    "therefore we concluded that the orbit is eccentric .",
    "the possible annular eclipse in the superwasp data has a length of @xmath07days and depth of @xmath00.03 mag .",
    "if confirmed this would indeed imply a large orbital eccentricity .    from the eclipse times and depth we were able to compute the luminosity and the radius of the secondary .",
    "all values seem to be compatible with an f main - sequence star .",
    "the mass - luminosity relation for main - sequence stars then leads to a mass estimate of the secondary as well as its surface gravity .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ allres ] and the position of both stars are indicated in an h - r diagram in fig .",
    "[ fluxosc ] .",
    "kic8410637 is an extremely interesting binary for further follow - up .",
    "longer time series from _ kepler _ will improve dramatically the detection threshold for the derivation of the properties of the oscillations of the red giant .",
    "funding for this discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the entire _ kepler _ team for their efforts over many years . without these efforts",
    "it would not have been possible to obtain the results presented here .",
