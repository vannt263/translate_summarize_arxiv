    "we present a systematic investigation of possible definitions of conics extended to normed ( or minkowski ) planes . in the euclidean situation",
    "the metric definitions of conics and the analytic one , namely defining them as family of curves of second order , clearly yield the same type of curves ; so we have various different definitions of the same class of curves . in normed planes neither the metric definitions nor the analytic one yield the same type of curves .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear what the notions `` curve of second order '' , `` cone of second order '' or `` sections of a cone '' mean .",
    "we consider the usual metric definitions of conics in the euclidean plane , adopt them for normed planes and list various properties of the resulting classes of curves .",
    "+ by @xmath0 we denote a _",
    "normed _ or _ minkowski plane _ , i.e. , the affine plane equipped with a norm @xmath1 determined by the _ unit ball _ @xmath2 which is a compact , convex set centered at the _ origin _",
    "@xmath3 , being from the interior of @xmath4 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath4 is the _ unit circle _ @xmath5 of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath4 ( or the norm induced by @xmath4 ) is _ strictly convex _ if @xmath5 contains no proper segment .",
    "we use small letters like @xmath6 for points",
    "/ vectors in @xmath0 , and the symbol @xmath7 $ ] describes the closed segment with different endpoints @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that the notion of _ bisector _ @xmath10 of two different points @xmath11 from @xmath0 , defined by @xmath12 can be suitably extended to bisectors of two point sets ( instead of the two points @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) ; see [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] for that notion .",
    "the _ d - segment _ with different endpoints @xmath8 and @xmath9 from @xmath0 is the point set defined by @xmath13_d = \\ { { \\bf z}\\in x : \\| { \\bf x } -{\\bf z}\\| + \\| { \\bf z}- { \\bf y}\\| = \\| { \\bf x}- { \\bf y}\\| \\};\\ ] ] see @xmath14 in [ 3 ] . of course ,",
    "depending on the shape of @xmath4 , bisectors and @xmath15-segments are geometrically interesting and can even be two - dimensional ; see again [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , and @xmath14 in [ 3 ] .",
    "but it should be noticed that , for strictly convex norms , any bisector is homeomorphic to a line and any @xmath15-segment is a usual segment .",
    "first we consider the usual metric definitions of ellipses in the euclidean plane and examine their analogues ( i.e. , generalizations ) for normed planes .",
    "+    for this purpose we give the basic figure of an ellipse in the euclidean plane ( see fig.1 ) , containing the foci @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a ( variable ) point @xmath16 corresponding to the distance sum @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 denoting the euclidean norm ) , the tangent line at this point @xmath16 , the reflected image of @xmath9 in this line , the leading circle @xmath19 which is the locus of such reflected images , and the leading line @xmath20 , defined as the common tangent of the circles having radius @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is half the distance of the foci .",
    "in normed planes we have three different possibilities to define ellipses metrically . until now , only the first one was investigated ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so the following three definitions refer to a normed plane @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the set @xmath26 is called _ the ellipse defined by its foci _ @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a homothetic copy of the unit disk @xmath4 , and @xmath30 be an arbitrary point from it .",
    "the locus of points @xmath31 for which there is a positive @xmath32 such that @xmath33 touches @xmath19 and contains @xmath34 on its boundary is called _ the ellipse defined by its leading circle and its focus _ * x*.    let @xmath20 be a straight line , @xmath8 a point , and @xmath35 a ratio larger than 1 .",
    "the locus of points @xmath31 , for which there is a positive @xmath36 such that the boundary of the disk @xmath33 contains * x * and the disk @xmath37 touches the line @xmath20 , is called _ the ellipse defined by its leading line and its focus _ * x*.    the equivalence of these definitions for the euclidean subcase is well known , and this can be easily checked with the help of fig .",
    "1 . we will prove that , while the first two definitions are equivalent also in normed planes , the third one yields a basically different class of curves .    in any normed plane",
    "the following holds : an ellipse , defined by its foci , is always an ellipse defined by its leading circle and a focus , and the converse statement is also true . on the other hand ,",
    "an ellipse defined by its leading line and a focus is not necessarily an ellipse defined by its foci , and again the converse is true .",
    "* proof : * first we consider an ellipse which is defined by its leading circle .",
    "thus we have two disks @xmath38 and @xmath39 in touching position .",
    "then the line joining their centers contains a point from the intersection of their boundaries .",
    "call this point @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 thus @xmath42 implying that @xmath43 .     +    on the other hand , with the same notation for a point @xmath43 , its definition yields @xmath44 . consider the disk @xmath45 .",
    "this disk is touching @xmath19 . since @xmath46 @xmath8 is on the boundary of @xmath47 .",
    "now we give examples showing that there exists an ellipse which is defined via its leading line but is not an ellipse defined via its foci , and conversely .    in fig .",
    "3 we can see that there is an ellipse following the third definition which is not centrally symmetric . by theorem 2 of @xcite",
    "it is not an ellipse by the first definition . in our example",
    "the norm is the @xmath48 norm , and the leading line @xmath20 and the focus @xmath8 are in `` symmetric position '' with respect to the circle of this minkowski plane , which is a square .",
    "plane , title=\"fig : \" ] +     +    conversely , consider the ellipse @xmath49 defined by its foci and shown in fig .",
    "4 . first we can see that if it is also an ellipse defined by its leading line , then the leading line @xmath20 and the new focus @xmath50 have to be in `` symmetric position '' with respect to the line joining the original foci .",
    "`` symmetric '' means that this line is parallel to a diagonal of the unit square .",
    "in fact , if this is not the case , we get a figure as shown on the left side of fig .",
    "4 . the squares @xmath51 with centers @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath16 , @xmath54 , respectively , touch @xmath20 . the focus has to lie in the shaded rectangle , as the common point of the boundaries of homothetic copies @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of such squares ( with a homothety ratio smaller than 1 ) . on the other hand , the boundary of the square @xmath58 intersects the shaded rectangle in a segment parallel to that one in which it is intersected by @xmath57 .",
    "so it is    we now assume that @xmath20 and @xmath50 have symmetric position ( see the right side of fig .",
    "if this holds and the euclidean distance of @xmath20 and @xmath52 is @xmath59 , and that of @xmath60 and @xmath8 is @xmath61 , then , using the fact that the points @xmath52 , @xmath62 and @xmath53 have to lie on the new ellipse , we have the equalities @xmath63 implying that @xmath64 and showing that @xmath65 .",
    "thus the leading line and the focus are both determined . on the other hand ,",
    "the point @xmath66 is not on the obtained ellipse , since the required ratio for it is @xmath67 .    in a normed plane ,",
    "an ellipse defined by its leading line and its focus is a convex curve , which is strictly convex if and only if this normed plane is strictly convex .    *",
    "proof : * we have to prove that the set @xmath68 is a convex domain .",
    "it is open by the continuity of the norm function . to prove its convexity",
    ", we observe that for any pair of points @xmath69 from the considered set the inequality @xmath70 @xmath71 implies that the convex hull of @xmath72 and @xmath73 contains the ball @xmath74 by the convexity of the half - plane determined by @xmath20 the convexity property is valid .",
    "thus the boundary of this domain is a convex curve , as we stated .",
    "the second statement is clear from the definition .",
    "+    a euclidean hyperbola satisfies the same metric relations as a euclidean ellipse , only that now the ratio @xmath75 is smaller than 1 .",
    "the asymptotes of the hyperbola have directions @xmath76 , and the leading line intersects the asymptotes in points of the great circle ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "we also have three possible metric definitions .",
    "the first one is    given two points * x * , * y * in a normed plane and a distance denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 denotes _ the hyperbola defined by its foci _",
    "@xmath8 _ and _ @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath79 , then we use the notation @xmath80 for it .",
    "the analogue of theorem 1 from @xcite is given by our    let @xmath81 be a point of the unit circle",
    ". then we have :    \\(i ) @xmath82 is the bisector corresponding to the vector * x * ,    \\(ii ) if there is a neighborhood of * x * on @xmath5 in which @xmath5 is strictly convex , then @xmath83 is the union of the two half - lines @xmath84 and @xmath85 . if @xmath8 is a point of a piecewise linear part of @xmath5 , then it is the union of two closed cones .",
    "* proof : * the first statement is obviously true by the definition of the bisector given in the introduction .",
    "the second one follows from the concept and properties of @xmath15-segments in a minkowski plane and from our definition of hyperbola ; see @xcite , @xcite , and   9 of @xcite .",
    "from the above theorem it can be seen that a connected part of @xmath86 is , in general , not the boundary of a convex domain , because this property does not hold for a bisector ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following two statements are equivalent to each other :    \\(i ) @xmath4 is strictly convex .",
    "\\(ii ) for every @xmath87 and for each value @xmath88 the set @xmath86 is the union of two simple curves , each of which intersects any line parallel to @xmath89 $ ] in precisely two points .",
    "* proof : * from @xmath90 we get @xmath91 . in fact , if @xmath4 is strictly convex , then every line parallel to @xmath89 $ ] contains exactly two points , as said above .",
    "this holds by the definition of the hyperbola .",
    "these points , dissected by the point of the corresponding bisector , belong to the given line .",
    "thus the sets of the left and right points yield two curves , respectively , which are homeomorphic to the bisector and congruent to each other via reflection in the center of the hyperbola .",
    "but the bisector is a simple curve implying the analogous property for the two mentioned curves ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath4 is not strictly convex , then there is a segment in its boundary .",
    "let now @xmath8 be a point of @xmath5 on the diameter of @xmath4 parallel to this segment .",
    "a hyperbola , corresponding to the foci @xmath92 for every positive @xmath93 is the union of two closed domains intersected by a line , parallel to @xmath8 and far enough to this diameter , in two segments , since the bisector is also intersected by this line in a seqment .",
    "thus @xmath91 does not hold .    from this proof",
    "we can conclude that the topological properties of hyperbolas do not depend on the parameter @xmath93 and only on the position of their foci .",
    "thus @xmath91 is equivalent to    @xmath94 _ for every @xmath87 there is a value @xmath95 such that the set @xmath86 is the union of two simple curves , intersected by any line parallel to @xmath89 $ ] in precisely two points_.    analogously to the case of ellipses , we have also two further definitions for hyperbolas . these are given in the following .",
    "let @xmath29 be a homothetic copy of the unit disk @xmath4 , and @xmath96 be an arbitrary point exterior to @xmath19 .",
    "the locus of points @xmath31 for which there is a positive @xmath32 such that @xmath33 touches @xmath19 and contains @xmath34 on its boundary will be called _ the hyperbola defined by its leading circle and its focus _ * x*.    let @xmath20 be a straight line , @xmath8 be a point , and @xmath35 a ratio less than 1 .",
    "the locus of points @xmath31 , for which there is a positive @xmath36 such that the boundary of the disk @xmath33 contains * x * and the disk @xmath37 touches the line @xmath20 , will be called _ the hyperbola defined by its leading line and its focus _ * x*.    clearly , the three definitions are analogous to those for ellipses .    in normed planes ,",
    "a hyperbola defined by its foci is always a hyperbola defined by its leading circle and a focus .",
    "the converse statement is also true . in general",
    ", the third definition yields a different class of curves .",
    "* proof : * first we consider a hyperbola defined by its leading circle .",
    "then we have two homothetic copies of @xmath4 , @xmath38 and @xmath97 , in touching position .",
    "then the line joining their centers contains a point from the intersection of their boundaries .",
    "call this point @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath98 and @xmath99 implying that @xmath100 .    on the other hand , with the same notation we have for a point @xmath100 , by the given definition , that @xmath101 .",
    "consider the disk @xmath102 .",
    "this disk is touching @xmath19 . since @xmath103 @xmath16 is on the boundary of @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that the hyperbola defined by its foci is always a centrally symmetric set .",
    "this is , in general , not true for a hyperbola defined by its leading line and a focus ( see , e.g. , the example in fig .",
    "3 ) . this confirms the final statement in the proposition .",
    "+    the hyperbola defined by its leading line is the union of two simple curves .",
    "if the normed plane is strictly convex , then these curves can not contain segments .",
    "* proof : * we prove that the set @xmath104 of exterior points of the hyperbola defined by @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is the distance function of its arguments ) is convex with respect to the direction orthogonal to @xmath20 , where birkhoff orthogonality is meant .",
    "( the concept of _ directional convexity _ can be found in @xcite , in connection with the analogous property of the bisector ; and @xmath107 is said to be _ birkhoff orthogonal _ to @xmath108 if @xmath109 holds for any real @xmath110 . ) let * l * be a vector orthogonal to @xmath20",
    ". we will prove that if @xmath111 and @xmath112 are in @xmath104 for a value @xmath113 , then this also holds for every @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "now the three points @xmath111 , @xmath116 , @xmath112 are collinear , and their affine hull intersects @xmath20 in a point * r*. we have distinct cases depending on the position of * r * in this line .",
    "for example , assuming the order @xmath117 , we have for all @xmath115 @xmath118 @xmath119 and thus @xmath120 from this we get that @xmath121 as we stated .",
    "the other cases can be investigated and proved analogously .",
    "this means that the boundary of @xmath104 is the union of two curves homeomorphic to the line @xmath20 ; so they are simple curves intersected by every line parallel to the vector @xmath122 in one point .",
    "assume that the segment @xmath123 $ ] lies in the hyperbola defined by @xmath20 and @xmath8 .",
    "then we have for all @xmath124 @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the touching point of the disk having center @xmath127 with its tangent @xmath20 . since the disks touching @xmath20 are homothetic copies of each other , the vectors @xmath128 and @xmath129 are linearly dependent , and this implies that @xmath130 on the other hand , @xmath131 and so we also have @xmath132 for all @xmath133 .",
    "this means that with @xmath134 we have @xmath135 and so , for the points @xmath136 , we get @xmath137 by proposition 1 in @xcite this implies that the segment @xmath138\\ ] ] lies in @xmath5 .",
    "thus the unit ball has to be strictly convex , as we stated .",
    "the leading circle is a homothetic copy of the main circle with respect to the center * x*. so , if the common tangent of these two circles has unique touching points with these circles , in each case , then there is a natural definition of _ asymptotes _ joining the center @xmath139 and the touching points of the tangent lines lying on the main circle .",
    "since asymptotes separate those elements of the pencil of @xmath139 which intersect the conics from those which are not described by the other case ( when the tangent line touches the main circle in a segment ) , we have the possibility that , as general asymptotes , also conic domains occur . in fig .",
    "6 we can see the four possibilities .",
    "+    for the case of parabolas , the first two definitions have no analogue , and so we have only the third case .    in a normed plane ,",
    "let @xmath20 be a straight line , and @xmath8 be a point .",
    "the locus of the points @xmath140 for which there is a positive @xmath36 such that the boundary of the disk @xmath33 contains * x * and touches the line @xmath20 , will be called _ the parabola defined by its leading line and its focus _ * x*.    in a normed plane , the metric parabola is a simple curve which does not contain segments if and only if the normed plane under consideration is strictly convex .    * proof : * we first prove that if the plane is strictly convex , then any metric parabola is a simple , strictly convex curve , since it is the boundary of a strictly convex domain .    for simplicity , denote by @xmath141 the radius of that disk whose center is @xmath8 and which touches the line @xmath20 .",
    "we first show that the parabola is the common boundary of the two open domains defined by the inequalities @xmath142 @xmath143 respectively .",
    "consider a point * z * of the parabola .",
    "then @xmath144 , and by strict convexity there is a unique common point @xmath145 of @xmath20 and the circle with center @xmath16 and radius @xmath146 .",
    "the points of the segment @xmath147 $ ] are in @xmath148 , and the points of the segments @xmath149 $ ] are in @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "this holds since strict convexity implies that if a circle contains another one with smaller radius , then they have at most one common boundary point ( see fig . 8) .",
    "+    this means that the point @xmath16 is a common boundary point of the two domains .",
    "let @xmath151 and @xmath152 be two points of @xmath148 . then the disks with center @xmath153 and radius @xmath154 will touch @xmath20 at the points @xmath155 , respectively . observe that if @xmath156 , where @xmath124 , then @xmath157 but the vectors @xmath158 and @xmath159 are parallel to each other , and so @xmath160 implying the inequality @xmath161 and the convexity of @xmath148 .",
    "strict convexity follows from the fact that the inequality in our computation can not be an equality if the unit disk is strictly convex .",
    "if now the unit disk contains a segment on its boundary , then there is no uniquely determined touching point @xmath162 .",
    "but we can `` interprete '' all touching segments as @xmath162 , and the proof of the first part remains valid .",
    "this shows that the parabola is the common boundary of the two domains , @xmath148 and @xmath150 .",
    "the second part of our proof can also be applied , with the observation that in every situation we can choose points @xmath163 , respectively , such that the segments @xmath164 $ ] , @xmath165 , are parallel to each other .",
    "now we can use the first part of the calculation , replacing @xmath166 by @xmath167 , and it is easy to see that by the point @xmath168 we can represent the length @xmath169 , again confirming convexity .",
    "now our proof is complete if we observe that in case of @xmath170 there is a metric parabola containing segments , as we can also see in fig .",
    "of course , the projective geometry of a normed space and its embedded euclidean geometry is the same .",
    "but there is a possibility to take into consideration the metric , too , because in a `` nice '' normed space there is a theory of selfadjoint linear transformations .",
    "the following way is a possibility to define quadrics in the projective augmentation of any smooth , strictly convex space .",
    "we describe this method in the two - dimensional case , where the quadric is clearly a conic .",
    "every normed plane can be represented as a semi - inner product space ( s.i.p . ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if the unit disk is strictly convex , this representation is unique . as proved in @xcite , the orthogonality with respect to the s.i.p . is equivalent to the orthogonality concept of birkhoff ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "koehler proved in @xcite that if the generalized riesz - fischer representation theorem is valid in a normed space , then every bounded linear operator @xmath171 has a generalized adjoint @xmath172 defined by the equality @xmath173 it can be proved that if in all strictly convex and smooth spaces the above assumption holds , then in such a space there is a generalized adjoint .",
    "we remark that @xmath172 is in general not a linear transformation .",
    "we say that the linear mapping is _ self - adjoint _ if @xmath174 .",
    "if @xmath171 is self - adjoint , then any element of its class in the projective general linear group of @xmath175 is self - adjoint , too .",
    "so we can call such a family of operators _ class of self - adjoint linear operators of the projective space _ @xmath176 . now",
    "the concept of conics can be introduced as follows .",
    "let @xmath176 be a real projective space with the two - dimensional semi - inner product space @xmath177 .",
    "a ( non - degenerate ) projective conic is the zero set of a ( non - degenerate ) form @xmath178 , with an invertible self - adjoint operator @xmath171 of @xmath176 .",
    "we remark that the form @xmath179 is linear in its first argument , homogeneous in its second one , but is neither symmetric , bilinear nor positive .",
    "it is symmetric and bilinear if the semi - inner product is symmetric ; bilinear if the semi - inner product is additive in its second argument ; and positive if @xmath171 is a square operator ( meaning that it is the square of another self - adjoint operator , denoted by @xmath180 ) .",
    "the group of self - adjoint operators is basically determined by the unit disks , and it determines the projective conics .",
    "thus , in this setting the metric of the plane is also used for smooth , strictly convex normed planes ."
