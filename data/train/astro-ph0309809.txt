    "the pointing was determined so that the entire galaxy was located on the s3 chip and so that the center of the galaxy was not on a node boundary of the chip .",
    "although a number of serendipitous sources are seen on the other chips , the analysis of ngc 4649 in this paper will be based on data from the s3 chip alone .",
    "the data were telemetered in faint mode , and only events with asca grades of 0,2,3,4 , and 6 were included .",
    "we excluded bad pixels , bad columns , and the columns next to bad columns and to the chip node boundaries .",
    "we checked for periods of incorrect aspect solution , and none were found .",
    "the total exposure for the s3 chip was 36,780 s.    _ chandra _ is known to encounter periods of high background ( `` background flares '' ) , which especially affect the backside - illuminated s1 and s3 chips .",
    "we determined the background count rate , using the s1 chip to avoid the enhanced flux due to the galaxy ngc  4649 on the s3 chip .",
    "unfortunately , much of the exposure was affected by background flares ; the light curve of the total count rate ( 0.310 kev ) for the s1 chip is shown in figure  [ fig : s1_lcurve ] .",
    "we used the program lc_cleanwritten by maxim markevitch to remove periods of high background and data drop - outs .",

    "after cleaning , 19,303 of the total 36,780 s of exposure time remained .    the expected quiescent rate for the s1 chip during this period in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band is about1.41 cnt s@xmath5 .",
    "after the removal of background flares , the mean quiescent s1 rate during our observation was 1.61 cnt s@xmath5 .",
    "the other , front - side illuminated chips also show excess background . by examining different energy bands we determined that most of the excess background in the s1 chip was below 5 kev , with our quiescent rates being in excess of the expected rates by about 21% in the 0.3 - 1.0 kev band , 27% in the 1.0 - 5.0 kev band , and 9% in the 5.0 - 10.0 kev band .",

    "1997 ) and that of diffuse emission from the virgo cluster ( bhringer et al .",
    "the excess background at hard energies ( 9% ) is probably due to a slightly elevated particle background , even when the background flares are removed . if we assume that this is the case and renormalize the blank sky data used to determine the quiescent rate given above so that the count rate in the 510 kev band matches what we observed with the s1 chip ( see   [ sec : spectra ] ) , then the excess emission from the virgo cluster and the nps determined from the rosat observations can completely account for the remaining excess background emission in the 0.35 kev energy band .",
    "we therefore conclude that the excess background emission we detect is a combination of emission from the virgo cluster , the nps , and an elevated particle background .",

    "the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ implies that the sensitivity to point sources is not affected very strongly by the background .",

    "we also did the source detection on the data after the removal of the background flares ; the stronger sources were all found in both cases , but the very faintest sources were not detected as significantly in the cleaned exposure at a level consistent with the much shorter exposure ( 19,303 vs.  36,780 s ) .",

    "similarly , the total number of expected background sources based on deep _ chandra _ counts with these hardness ratios and @xmath64 net counts ( e.g. , those sources that would be plotted in figure  [ fig : colors ] ) is @xmath65 , as compared to the 12 sources listed above with relatively well - known hardness ratios .",
    "thus , it is likely that many of these sources are associated with ngc  4649 or ngc  4647 .",
    "we used the ciaoscript psextract to extract spectra . for",
    "extended or multiple sources , the response matrices were determined using the calcrmf / calcarf package written by alexey vikhlinin and jonathan mcdowell , which weighted them by the x - ray brightness in the 0.52 kev energy band over the corresponding image region .",
    "we used the gain file acisd2000-01-29gainn0003.fits and the fef file acisd2000 - 01 - 29fef_pin0001.fits .",
    "for the individual resolved sources , local backgrounds were used . for the diffuse spectra",
    ", we used the blank sky background files provided by maxim markevitchto generate background spectra . since the count rate we detected on the s1 chip was in excess of the quiescent background rate expected ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) , we renormalized the blank sky background spectra to match our observed s1 data in the 510 kev band .",
    "the blank sky background spectra for the s3 chip , which was used as background for the spectral analysis of the diffuse emission throughout , was normalized by this same factor .",
    "when fitting spectra we consider only the 0.710 kev energy band throughout since the response below 0.7 kev is uncertain .",
    "each spectrum has been grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per pulse invariant ( pi ) channel so that @xmath66 statistics apply .",
    "we used xspec to fit models to the spectra .",
    "for all the fitted models discussed here , the absorption column was fixed at the galactic value ( @xmath67 @xmath68 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) . allowing the absorption to vary did not improve the fits significantly .",
    "one concern with normalizing the blank sky background spectra in this way is that the spectrum of the excess background in our observations may differ from that in the blank sky background observations .",
    "for example , the excess background might be due to the virgo cluster or the north polar spur . to model this effect , we determined the spectrum of the excess background on the s1 chip , using the normalized blank sky data as a background . since we expect this excess emission to be mainly due to diffuse gas ( in the virgo cluster or north polar spur ) , we modeled this excess emission with a mekal model .",
    "while we did find a statistically good fit , the temperature and abundance were only very poorly constrained .",
    "we included this excess background component in our fits for the diffuse emission in ngc  4649 , freezing the spectral parameters to the best fit values obtained above .",
    "the normalization was scaled with the area of the detector used . although including this component did somewhat affect the normalizations of the other model components , the fitted values for the temperature and abundance agreed with the results we obtained without including this component to well within the errors . including this excess emission component in the fit to the outermost annulus defined in table  [ tab : spec_grad ] , where the effect is likely to be the largest due to the faintness of the diffuse emission there , only changed our results by an amount comparable to the errors ( for instance",
    ", the best fit temperature decreased by 0.02 kev ) .",
    "we conclude that the difference in the shape of the spectra between our true background and the blank sky background data is not large enough to significantly affect our spectral fitting results , and therefore do not include this component when doing spectral analyses of diffuse emission .",
    "a summary of the best fitting spectral models is given in table  [ tab : spectra ] for different components of the x - ray emission .",
    "the first column gives the origin of the spectrum , the second column lists the spectral model used , the third and fourth columns give the temperature @xmath69 and abundances ( if relevant ) for the softer component of the spectrum , the fifth column gives the power - law photon spectral index @xmath70 or temperature @xmath71 of the harder component in the spectrum , the sixth column gives the value of @xmath66 and the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and the last column gives the number of net counts ( after background subtraction ) in the spectrum .",

    "if the lmxbs are distributed like the stars then roughly 50% of the lmxbs will be contained within this radius , whereas we expect to find @xmath201 background agn in this region . choosing this radius has the additional advantage that it facilitates comparisons of our results with results from optical observations of ngc  4649 . for this source spectrum",
    ", we only considered photon energies of 0.78.0 kev since the bins with energies @xmath72 kev had very large errors .",
    "we first considered models in which the spectrum of the sources was represented by a single , hard component .",
    "initially , we tried a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( `` bremss '' in table  [ tab : spectra ] ) with a temperature @xmath71 . while this model gave a statistically significant fit , with a @xmath66 per dof of @xmath73 ,",
    "the temperature @xmath71 was poorly constrained . as an alternative",
    ", we also fit the source spectrum with a power law with a photon index of @xmath70 .",
    "this gave an acceptable fit to the spectrum which was slightly better than the fit given by the thermal bremsstrahlung model , with a @xmath66 per dof of @xmath74 .",
    "we will adopt this as our best - fit model for the spectrum of the source population .",
    "we also tried a model for the sources with a power - law hard component and a blackbody ( `` bbody '' ) soft component .",
    "this gave a slightly better fit to the spectrum , but had very large uncertainties in the power - law index and blackbody temperature .",
    "thus , we prefer the simpler power - law model .      we extracted the diffuse emission within one @xmath75 of the center of ngc  4649 ( figure  [ fig : diffuse_spec ] ) , excluding all sources except src .",
    "the x - ray color of the diffuse emission in this region is soft , with hardness ratios of ( h21,h31 ) @xmath76 .",
    "the spectrum shows strong emission lines .",
    "the most prominent are the helium - like lines ( @xmath171.85 kev ) and lines ( @xmath172.45 kev ) . also present in the spectra",
    "are lines and a blend of fe l lines .",
    "the strong lines indicate that the diffuse radiation is mainly thermal emission from interstellar gas , as expected in this x - ray bright elliptical galaxy .    based on the line emitting spectrum , we first tried a single temperature mekal model .",
    "this did not provide an acceptable fit .",
    "in particular , the residuals showed that there was a significant excess of hard x - ray emission .",
    "since we would expect some hard x - ray emission from point sources below our detection limit , we tried modeling this hard component with a power - law spectrum .",
    "this provided a much improved fit , and removed the excess hard emission .",
    "the best - fit photon exponent was @xmath77 , which is very close to the value found for the resolved sources ; fixing the photon exponent to the best fit value found in ",
    "[ sec : src_spec ] , @xmath78 , does not significantly alter the fit so we assumed this value for consistency .",
    "this best - fit mekal model , shown in figure  [ fig : diffuse_spec ] , gave a gas temperature of @xmath79 and a heavy element abundance of about 0.58 solar .",
    "we interpret this fit as representing soft emission from hot diffuse gas combined with a hard power - law emission from unresolved sources .",
    "this model still has a @xmath80 which is larger than unity . examining the residuals",
    ", one finds that a substantial portion of the @xmath66 originates in residuals at the positions of lines .",
    "for example , the si and s lines in the model spectrum are too weak , and the fe lines are a bit too strong .",
    "this suggests that the ratios of the heavy elements in this galaxy do not simply scale with the solar ratios . to include wider abundance variations",
    ", we fit the soft component of the spectrum with a vmekal model , in which each of the heavy element abundances could vary independently .",
    "we also fixed the normalization of the vmekal component to the normalization given for the mekal component from the soft mekal plus hard power - law model just discussed . allowing this normalization to vary",
    "did somewhat improve the @xmath66 of the fit , but it gave abundance values which were unreasonably high . while the vmekal model improved the fit , most of the thirteen abundances considered in this model were very poorly constrained . examining",
    "the abundances from this fit suggested that the elements could be divided into two groups : the light elements ( c through ar ) and the iron group elements ( ca , fe , and ni ) .",
    "this model , with the normalization allowed to vary , gave a somewhat better fit to the spectrum , with a gas temperature of @xmath81 kev and an abundance of about 1.68 solar for the light elements and 1.12 solar for the iron group elements ( see also table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "it may be surprising that these abundance values are both higher than the abundance found above by the best - fit mekal model ( one might have expected the overall abundance to be an average of the abundances for the light element and iron group elements ) .",
    "this occurs because separating the elements into two groups allows for more freedom in determining the normalizations of each model component . as a result the vmekal normalization",
    "is decreased relative to the normalization of the mekal model found above and the abundances must be increased to match the observed line strengths . since this vmekal model still did not provide a good fit to the spectrum of the diffuse emission , we tried adding a cooling flow component ( mkcflow ) to the mekal plus power - law model described above , with the high temperature and abundance tied to the temperature and abundance values of the mekal component and the lower temperature frozen at @xmath82 kev . adding",
    "the mkcflow component did not improve the @xmath66 of the fit .",
    "we found an upper limit on the mass accretion rate of @xmath83 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the spectral properties of the diffuse emission as a function of radius were examined to search for radial abundance and temperature gradients in the gas .",
    "the area within 120  of the galactic center was broken up into 9 concentric annuli each containing roughly 2000 net counts .",
    "the outer annuli have more gross counts ( but a higher fraction of background ) , so that these spectra have more grouped bins and a larger number of dofs . since the mekal and vmekal models provided roughly statistically equivalent fits to the total diffuse emission ( see   [ sec : diffuse_spec ] ) , we choose to fit each region with the simpler mekal plus power - law spectral model with @xmath70 fixed at 1.78 .",
    "the results of the fits are given in table  [ tab : spec_grad ] .",
    "although the temperature of the diffuse gas does appear to vary slightly as a function of radius , there is no clear trend with temperature or abundance as a function of radius .",
    "if one excludes the central circle ( where the fit is poor ) , there is a stronger trend for the temperature to increase slightly with increasing radius .",
    "while most of the fits in table  [ tab : spec_grad ] are adequate , the spectral fit to the central circle is not .",
    "this suggests that the central region may require an additional component or components to accurately model its spectrum .",
    "note that the central circle contains enhanced diffuse emission due to a `` bar '' (   [ sec : central_bar ] ) .",
    "an examination of the residuals of the mekal plus power - law fit to the central region revealed that the model was systematically fainter than the data at energies @xmath20 0.9 kev .",
    "we therefore tried adding a cool component to the mekal plus power - law model to accommodate the data .",
    "first we tried adding a second mekal component , with the abundances of the two thermal components being equal , which improved the fit . allowing the abundances to vary independently",
    "did not significantly alter the fit .",
    "the two temperatures in this model were @xmath84 and @xmath85 kev , with an abundance of @xmath86 solar .",
    "the @xmath66 of the two - temperature fit is 67.9 for 44 degrees of freedom , and while this is a significant improvement over the single temperature model it still is not a particularly good fit .",
    "we therefore also tried a mekal plus power - law plus cooling flow ( mkcflow ) model with the abundances and higher temperatures of the mekal and mkcflow components set equal to one another and the lower temperature set to @xmath82 kev . while the @xmath66 of this fit was 78.0 for 45 degrees of freedom , better than the mekal plus power - law model , the @xmath66 of this fit was not as good as that of the two mekal component model .",
    "in addition , the abundance was very poorly constrained .",
    "this fit gave a temperature of @xmath87 kev , and an upper limit on the mass accretion rate of @xmath88 yr@xmath5 .",
    "we note that other authors have also found a preference for two - temperature models over cooling flow and single - phase models in the centers of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , buote 2002 ) .",
    "the smoothed image in figure  [ fig : xray_smo ] shows some evidence for structure in the diffuse emission near the core of ngc  4649 .",
    "specifically , there appeared to be faint `` fingers '' extending out from the core , between about 21  and 53  from the center of the diffuse emission .",
    "these radial features are shown more clearly in figure  [ fig : soft_nuc ] , which is an adaptively smoothed image of the center of ngc  4649 .",
    "these features are far too strong to be due to the support structure of the telescope .",
    "to check the statistical significance of these features , we defined a series of regions containing the most obvious fingers .",
    "we considered only the raw data , unsmoothed and uncorrected for exposure , to ensure that the fingers were not an artifact of the smoothing process .",
    "detected point sources were removed from all of the regions .",
    "we then compared the average surface brightness of these regions to that of other regions in between the fingers at the same distance from the center of ngc  4649 .",
    "for the regions containing the fingers , we found on average @xmath89 cnt s@xmath5 pix@xmath5 , and @xmath90 cnt s@xmath5 pix@xmath5 for the regions without fingers ( 1-@xmath10 errors ) .",
    "the excess of counts in the regions containing fingers was therefore significant at the 4.1-@xmath10 level .",
    "as a further test of the significance of these features , we examined the azimuthal brightness profile in an annulus ranging from 21  to 53  centered on the peak of the diffuse emission .",
    "we then divided this annulus into 20 angular bins of 18  each and did a @xmath66 significance test comparing the counts in each bin to the mean number of counts per bin ( an azimuthal plot of the flux in each bin is given in figure  [ fig : fingers ] ) .",
    "we found a reduced @xmath66 of @xmath91 , which suggests that the azimuthal brightness profile is not well described by a constant .",
    "it is therefore possible that the radial fingers we observed are real features in the diffuse emission .",
    "the hardness ratios of the fingers , ( h21,h31 ) @xmath92 , and the hardness ratios of the regions between the fingers ( h21,h31 ) @xmath93 were both similar to the hardness ratios of the total diffuse emission within one effective radius ( see   [ sec : diffuse_spec ] ) .",
    "radial features have been produced in some numerical hydrodynamical simulations of cooling flows in elliptical galaxies ( kritsuk , bhringer , & mller 1998 , hereafter kbm ) .",
    "kbm give results from two - dimensional axisymmetric hybrid inflow - outflow models which show such features .",
    "the physical extent of their features ( @xmath94 kpc ) is about the same as those we observe ( @xmath95 kpc ) .",
    "their model predicts an azimuthally - averaged temperature profile which is depressed in the central region of the galaxy and rises out to about 10 kpc ( see their fig .",
    "we find some evidence for a temperature profile which rises with radius , excluding the central 4  of the galaxy where the x - ray spectrum may be complicated by the presence of the x - ray bar discussed in   [ sec : central_bar ] ( see table  [ tab : spec_grad ] ) .",
    "the simulations of kbm predict outflowing jets of hot gas , surrounded by inflowing gas which is significantly cooler than the outflowing gas at the same distance from the galactic center ( see their fig .  7 ) .",
    "we therefore fit spectra accumulated from the sum of the finger regions and from the regions in between the fingers , using the same mekal plus power - law model used to fit the spectrum of the diffuse emission .",
    "the abundances in these fits were fixed at 0.6 solar . if the abundances were allowed to vary the resulting values were unreasonably high and had large errors . the temperatures and @xmath66 s given by the fits were not significantly affected by fixing the abundance values .",
    "the results of these fits are given in table  [ tab : spectra ] . while the bright fingers are slightly hotter than the regions between the fingers , the 90% confidence intervals overlap . in the kbm model",
    ", one would expect larger temperature differences of about a factor of two , although projection effects might somewhat reduce these differences .",
    "more seriously , in the kbm model the bright regions would be considerably cooler than the faint regions , whereas the bright regions are slightly hotter in the observations . thus , while some form of convective instability may explain the fingers in ngc  4649 , only the morphology is reproduced by the kbm model .",
    "figure  [ fig : bar ] shows an even smaller region at the nucleus of ngc  4649 from the same image shown in ( figure  [ fig : soft_nuc ] ) .",
    "there appears to be a small bar , approximately 5   long , located at the central peak in the diffuse emission . to assess the significance of the elongation of this feature",
    ", we determined the net counts in an elliptical region corresponding to this bar and compared it to the net counts in an identical region perpendicular to and crossing the center of the bar .",
    "the counts in the area where these two regions overlapped were excluded .",
    "we found @xmath96 net counts in the bar region and @xmath97 net counts in the perpendicular off - bar region ( 1-@xmath10 errors ) . while this is not a large difference , it is marginally statistically significant ( a 2.5-@xmath10 detection )",
    "the bar appears to be oriented roughly perpendicular to the x - ray isophotes at larger radii , which go from sw to ne .",
    "it also appears to be somewhat asymmetric , with the sw end being somewhat brighter than the ne end ( if we identify the brightest point in the bar as its center ) .",
    "the bar is included in the region given for src .  1 as detected by the source detection algorithm we used ( see   [ sec : src_detect ] ) , although the region of src .",
    "1 is not centered on nor rotationally aligned with the ( much smaller ) bar .",
    "radio observations of the center of ngc  4649 with the very large array show an extended object , @xmath98 in size oriented 31  east of north ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) , making it coincident with the x - ray bar we observe .",
    "the radio source has an integrated flux density of 18 mjy at 4.86 ghz .",
    "a recent unrelated study of the _ chandra _ data has detected a soft ( 0.20.6 kev ) central source that the authors interpret as being a quiescent supermassive black hole ( soldatenkov , vikhlinin , & pavlinsky 2003 ) .",
    "although no exact position for this source is given it is said to be at the peak of the optical emission , and therefore presumably near to or contained within the x - ray bar we observe .",
    "unfortunately , there are too few counts from the bar to determine its spectral properties .",
    "we can , however , determine the x - ray colors of the bar .",
    "we find that the x - ray color is medium - soft , with ( h21,h31 ) @xmath99 , 1-@xmath10 errors ) .",
    "this is somewhat harder than the color of the diffuse emission within one effective radius , ( h21,h31 ) @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is also slightly harder than the color of the perpendicular off - bar region , although they are consistent within the errors .",
    "however , the x - ray emission is probably not hard enough to indicate a strong shock in the region of the bar .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this bar .",
    "first , the bar may be an emission feature , or due to excess absorption perpendicular to the bar .",
    "if the bar were due to excess absorption perpendicular to the bar , the off - bar region would have a particularly hard spectrum , whereas the hardness ratios indicate that the bar is slightly harder than the off - bar region .",
    "in addition , when doing spectral fits to the central region of ngc  4649 , allowing the local absorption to vary did not improve the fit .",
    "if the bar is an emission feature , it might be a rotating disk or torus viewed edge - on , perhaps produced by the cooling of rotating x - ray gas ( e.g. , brighenti & mathews 2000 ) .",
    "however , if this were the case one would expect the bar to be cooler than the surrounding gas , which is not true here .",
    "alternatively , the bar could be a shock associated with the expansion of a central radio source , as appears to have occurred in ngc  4636 ( jones et al .",
    "although the x - ray colors of the bar are not hard enough to indicate a strong shock , they are somewhat harder than the surrounding diffuse emission .",
    "furthermore , the bar appears to be coincident with the extended radio source at the center of the galaxy , although the radio emission is relatively weak .",
    "although we did not detect a central x - ray source which could be associated with an agn , the recent detection by soldatenkov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which they interpret as a quiescent supermassive black hole , could be responsible for the radio structure and the x - ray bar .",
    "however , it should be noted that the interpretation of the central source as an lmxb can not be completely ruled out due to its low luminosity ( @xmath101 ergs s@xmath5 in the 0.20.6 kev band ) .",
    "still , the interpretation of the bar as resulting from compression from the radio source is probably the most consistent explanation given the existing data .",
    "we have presented results from a _",
    "chandra _ observation of the x - ray bright elliptical galaxy ngc  4649 .",
    "both bright diffuse emission and point sources are detected , with the bright diffuse emission dominating the overall emission .",
    "a total of 165 discrete sources were detected .",
    "fourteen of these sources had possible faint optical counterparts in the dss image of the same field .",
    "of these fourteen , three had positions listed in the usno - a2.0 catalog . in a region to the nw of the center of ngc  4649",
    "we find roughly 20 x - ray sources whose positions match those of globular clusters seen in hst images . in this region ,",
    "roughly 45% of the x - ray sources are identified with globular clusters .",
    "some of the sources may be associated with the companion sc galaxy ngc  4647 .",
    "however , we do not detect x - rays from the type i supernova sn1979a in ngc  4649 .",
    "we do detect the serendipitous _ rosat _ source rx j1244.1 + 1134 as a blend of three sources .",
    "the luminosity function of the resolved sources is well described by a broken power - law , with a break luminosity which is somewhat larger than the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 @xmath102 neutron star .",
    "this break luminosity is slightly larger than previously determined values for other early - type galaxies ( sarazin et al .",
    "2000 ; blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , although it is consistent with previous measurements within the errors .",
    "emission from diffuse gas swamps emission from discrete sources near the center of ngc  4649 .",
    "no point sources are detected within 12  of the center of the galaxy .",
    "we find no conclusive evidence for a central agn , although another study of the _ chandra _ data has found evidence for a central quiescent supermassive black hole .",
    "we give an upper limit of @xmath28 ( 0.310 kev ) @xmath103 erg s@xmath5 for the x - ray luminosity of any agn .",
    "the composite x - ray spectrum of the resolved sources within 1 @xmath104 is best described by a power - law with a photon spectral index of @xmath78 .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission is best fit by a mekal plus power - law model , with a gas temperature @xmath105 kev , an abundance of roughly 58% of solar , and @xmath70 frozen at 1.78 .",
    "this argues that the diffuse emission is a combination of emission from diffuse gas and unresolved lmxbs .",
    "there is some evidence that the abundances of iron group elements are lower than those of lighter elements when compared to the solar ratios .",
    "there is also evidence for radial features in the diffuse emission extending out from the center of ngc  4649 , and for a central bar .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of cooling flows in elliptical galaxies by kritsuk et al .",
    "( 1998 ) predict such radial features , which result from convective motions with relatively hot outflowing gas separated by regions of cooler inflowing gas .",
    "however , only the morphology of the observed fingers match the specific predictions of the kbm model .    the central bar is roughly perpendicular to the x - ray and optical isophotes at larger radii , is parallel to the extension in the weak central radio source , and may contain a recently detected quiescent supermassive black hole .",
    "we suggest that the x - ray bar may be produced by an interaction between the central radio source and the surrounding x - ray gas .",

    "<S> the fingers are morphologically similar to radial features seen in two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of cooling flows in elliptical galaxies , and although their other properties do not match the predictions of the particular simulations used we conclude that the radial fingers might be due to convective motions of hot outflowing gas and cooler inflowing gas . </S>",
