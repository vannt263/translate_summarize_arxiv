    "recently , novel spatially inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic phases have been found to occur in various condensed matter systems . similar to classical liquid crystals,@xcite",
    "these quantum phases can be classified according to their broken symmetries .",
    "one such phase is the smectic phase , often referred to as a stripe phase .",
    "this phase can be viewed as an unidirectional charge density wave phase which spontaneously breaks translational symmetry along one direction .",
    "experimental evidence for smectic phases has been found in several transition - metal oxide compounds . in particular , a stripe crystal phase has been observed in manganese oxide compounds by electron diffraction.@xcite moreover , neutron scattering experiments have provided indirect evidence for stripe phases in the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors.@xcite    another such phase is the nematic phase  an anisotropic phase with broken rotational symmetry , but with translational symmetry in tact .",
    "this phase can be thought of as a smectic phase `` melted '' via the proliferation of topological defects .",
    "nematic phases have been argued to be the source of the anisotropic transport observed in quantum hall systems in high landau levels@xcite , and to be relevant to the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors as well.@xcite however , an understanding of the transition from the smectic to nematic phase due to the proliferation of the topological defects still remains to be achieved .",
    "recently , a complementary approach to studying the nematic phase was suggested.@xcite in this approach , the nematic phase is obtained from an isotropic liquid by breaking rotational symmetry . in the continuum limit",
    ", it was shown that the goldstone mode resulting from breaking rotational symmetry leads to non - fermi liquid behavior in the single - particle lifetime.@xcite exotic superconducting instabilities mediated by the collective mode in the nematic phase were also studied.@xcite    while the consequences of the nematic order in the recent complementary approach were studied in ref .",
    ", we still lack an understanding of the phase transition between the isotropic and nematic phases . in this work ,",
    "we study a model for the nematic phase on a square lattice , with emphasis on the phase transitions between the isotopic and nematic phases .",

    "[ fig : lambdaplot ] , we show the behavior of the nematic order @xmath21 as a function of chemical potential , @xmath11 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 at @xmath29",
    ". an important feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdaplot ] is the sharp onset and offset of nematic order at critical values of @xmath11 : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the free energy near the transition  @xmath32 and @xmath33  shows three minima at finite @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates a region of coexistence of the isotropic and nematic phases : it reflects the negative quartic term in the ginzburg - landau free energy.@xcite hence , the transition between the isotropic and nematic phases is first order . the electron density as a function of @xmath11 shows a discontinuity at these critical values of @xmath36 , which is a signature of the first order transition .    to better understand the behavior of the nematic order , as well as the robustness of our result , we considered the dependence of @xmath21 on the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath9 . upon increasing @xmath37",
    ", we found the maximum value of @xmath21 to increase . also , increasing @xmath37 shifts the critical values of @xmath11 , making the region over which nematic order exists wider .",
    "furthermore , we found an absence of nematic order for all doping concentrations if @xmath38 ( within the numerical precision ) for @xmath27 . by varying @xmath9",
    ", we found the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdaplot ] to shift .",
    "in particular , when @xmath39 , @xmath21 is maximal at @xmath40 ( _ i.e. _ half - filling ) and is a symmetric function of @xmath11 .",
    "this is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry present when @xmath39 . though the critical values of @xmath11 and the maximal value of @xmath21 depend on the value of @xmath20 and @xmath9 , we would like to stress that the qualitative features of the phase transition between the isotropic and nematic liquids are not sensitive to the choice of parameters . in what follows , we will present results for @xmath41 , and @xmath27 ( @xmath42 ) . for small hole concentrations ,",
    "this gives a hole - like fermi surface centered about @xmath43 ( see inset ( a ) of fig .  [",

    "such a fermi surface is consistent with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite and hall constant measurements @xcite in the high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "above , we saw that the nematic phase occurs in a finite regime dopings .",
    "furthermore , we found a dramatic change in the fermi surface topology upon developing nematic order .",

    "[ fig : nhallplot ] . ) in this section , we study the conductivity tensor to probe the nematic order , as the conductivity tensor , especially the hall conductivity is sensitive to the topology of the fermi surface . within a boltzmann equation approach ,",
    "the longitudinal conductivities are ( in units where @xmath44 ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 = @xmath24 or @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the electron s charge , @xmath49 is the component of the fermi velocity along the @xmath46-axis , and @xmath50 is the transport lifetime . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "@xmath51 parallel to the @xmath52-axis , the hall conductivity is@xcite @xmath53 in what follows , we will report results for the case @xmath54 .",

    "[ nematic ] , we plot the conductivity tensor vs. @xmath11 in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmaplot ] . for comparison ,",
    "the conductivity tensor without nematic order ( @xmath55 ) is shown as a dashed line .",
    "when nematic order develops , the fermi surface topology changes dramatically .",
    "more specifically , the hole - like fermi surface with nematic order becomes an open fermi surface upon developing nematic order . in the nematic state ,",
    "the fermi surface is rather flat along the @xmath56-direction .",
    "( see inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : nhallplot ] . )",
    "hence , the hole s motion along the @xmath57-direction is enhanced , while it is suppressed along the @xmath56-direction .",
    "these changes in the fermi surface are reflected in the longitudinal conductivities , figs .",
    "[ fig : sigmaplot](a ) and [ fig : sigmaplot](b )  @xmath58 increases suddenly with the onset of nematic order ( at @xmath59 ) , while @xmath60 shows a sudden decrease .",
    "the hall conductivity , fig .  [ fig : sigmaplot](c ) , shows a dramatic drop at @xmath59 as well .",
    "however , its change is small compared with @xmath58 and @xmath60 .",
    "this occurs because the hall conductivity is not only sensitive to the fermi surface s topology , but also its curvature.@xcite as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaplot](c ) , the hall conductivity already decreases fairly rapidly without nematic order .",
    "the dotted lines at the transition indicate that boltzmann equation , eq .  [ boltz ] is not applicable near the transition , since there are two phases with different densities coexist .",
    "another quantity of interest is the hall constant @xmath61 , which measures the number of charge carriers , and is related to the hall resistivity . for weak magnetic fields ,",
    "the hall resistivity is @xmath62 which defines @xmath61 in terms of @xmath63 . for the case of a single - band fermi liquid model with a circular ( or elliptical ) fermi surface",
    ", @xmath61 is the density of charge carriers per unit cell _ i.e. _ the area of the fermi surface .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhallplot ] , we plot the hall constant , @xmath61 as a function of chemical potential , @xmath11 . for comparison ,",
    "the hall number without nematic order ( @xmath55 ) is shown as a dashed line .",
    "notice the sharp drop of @xmath61 at @xmath59 , where nematic order becomes finite .",
    "it is expected that @xmath61 is almost constant in the region where nematic order exists , @xmath64 .",
    "this can be understood from the conductivity tensor in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaplot ]  the decrease of hole motion along the @xmath47 direction is compensated by the increase of hole motion along @xmath24 direction , giving a product @xmath65 which is nearly constant .",
    "to begin with , our results for the phase transition in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdaplot ] were obtained within a mean - field approximation .",
    "once fluctuations about the mean - field state are included , we expect the range over which the nematic phase exists to be reduced",
    ". furthermore , fluctuations will reduce the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the effect of fluctuations on the nature of phase transition will be addressed in near future .",
    "another approximation in our treatment was the neglect of collective modes . in the continuum limit of eq .",
    "[ model ] , the breaking of rotational symmetry leads to a goldstone mode ; scattering from this goldstone mode gives rise to non - fermi liquid behavior.@xcite on a lattice , however , this collective mode is gapped ; we expect scattering from the collective mode to have little effect on the @xmath66 conductivities .",
    "the subject of disorder deserves some discussion .",
    "though disorder was introduced to understand the behavior of the conductivity through the transitions , we did not address its effects on the transition between the isotropic and nematic phases , nor did we address its consequences on the nematic phase itself.@xcite in the absence of disorder , the mean - field treatment of the hamiltonian eq . [ model ] gave the transition between the isotropic and nematic phases to be first order . for systems that undergo a first order transition without disorder",
    ", it was shown that the system with quenched disorder could be mapped onto a random field ising model.@xcite based on this mapping , it was shown that in @xmath67 dimensions , the coexistence at the phase transition disappears for arbitrarily small amount of disorder ; in @xmath68 dimensions this occurs by the application of a finite amount of disorder .",
    "for the transition in this work , however , there are gapless fermions presents on both sides of the transition .",
    "therefore it is unclear to us how much the results obtained from the mapping may apply .",
    "we hope to address these issues in the future .",
    "it is also important to note that the conductivity tensor depends of the form of the transport scattering rate , and hence on the disorder .",
    "realistic models for disorder usually give transport scattering rates which are momentum dependent .",
    "in particular , in most high-@xmath0 materials , disorder is mainly due to the dopant ions , which lie outside of the @xmath69 planes . as a result , these dopant ions cause primarily forward scattering . in the above discussion , we described our results for the case @xmath70 .",
    "however , we have also considered the case where @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite such a form arises for out - of - plane disorder , causing primarily forward scattering.@xcite when @xmath55 , we found the overall features of @xmath61 to be very different from @xmath72 .",
    "however , the effect of the nematic order on the hall constant gives the same result as when @xmath70  there is a sharp drop in the hall constant in the nematic phase compared with the isotropic phase .",
    "our findings for the hall constant have potential relevance to the experiments of the normal state hall resistivity in the high-@xmath0 superconductor , bi@xmath73sr@xmath74la@xmath75cuo@xmath76.@xcite in these experiments , the hall constant was measured in the normal state at low temperatures , by suppressing superconductivity with a large pulsed magnetic field of 60 t. they observed saturation of the hall constant at low temperatures , suggesting conventional transport properties .",
    "however , the hall constant as a function of doping concentration shows a maximum at @xmath77 , and decreased sharply in underdoped regime . in overdoped regions",
    ", there is a regime near optimal doping @xmath78 , where the hall constant shows the dip  the decrease is about @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) of its maximum value ( @xmath81 ) at @xmath77 .",
    "the dip of the hall constant around @xmath82 becomes more pronounced at low temperatures ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this suggests that the nematic phase may be a candidate to explain the anomaly observed in the hall constant in high @xmath0 cuprates .    in conclusion , to study the nematic phase we considered the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ model ] with quadrupolar density - density interactions on a square lattice . within a mean - field analysis",
    ", we found the nematic phase to occur in a finite region of dopings .",
    "moreover , the transition between the isotropic and nematic phases was found to be first order ; a dramatic change in the fermi surface topology accompanied this transition .",
    "as the conductivity is sensitive to the topology of the fermi surface , we investigated the effects of nematic order on transport .",
    "we found the conductivity tensor and hall constant to show significant changes at the transitions between the isotropic and nematic phases .",
    "if observed , such signatures would give evidence for nematic order ; it would give evidence for the approach pursued in this paper as an appropriate description of nematic phases in physical systems .",
    "finally , we discussed the effect of disorder and the scattering from collective modes on the phase transitions and on the transport properties at the transitions .",
