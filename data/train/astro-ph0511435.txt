    "xmm - newton traces slewing paths over the sky while manoeuvering with both epic - pn and epic - mos cameras open .",
    "data from slew observations are recorded into slew data files ( sdf ) , which have been stored in the xmm - newton science archive ( xsa ) from revolution 314 .",
    "not all these data are scientifically useful and data from the epic - mos cameras are now used for calibration purposes .",
    "this paper describes the epic - pn slew data processing strategy , used to give a uniform coverage over the sky , in order to create the first catalogue of slew detections with xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "it also reports on the current status and scientific utility of the survey .",
    "the optimum source searching strategy derived for slew data processing @xcite is described below .",
    "the attitude reconstruction and spurious detections are dealt with in the corresponding subsections .",
    "data from the epic - pn camera are only used due to the faster readout in its observing modes and its high effective area with respect to the epic - mos cameras . in particular ,",
    "only ff , eff and lw modes are used because the other epic - pn modes are not appropiate for source determination .",
    "the characteristic low background of the observations ( average  0.1 cts / arcmin@xmath0 ) and the tight psf of the telescopes provide good sensitivity to detect extended sources @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , slews performed at times of enhanced solar activity have been rejected in the current processing although they are hoped to be included in the future .",
    "slew observations are divided into @xmath1  1 square degree event files before processing in order to get accurate positions over the sky . a near standard pipeline eboxdetect / emldetect tuned for @xmath1",
    "zero background was performed on images containing only single events ( pattern 0 ) in the 0.2 - 0.5 kev energy range and single plus double events ( patterns 0@xmath24 ) in the 0.5 - 12 kev band .",
    "three different energy bands are source searched independently : total band ( 0.2@xmath20.5 kev ) , soft band ( 0.2@xmath22 kev ) and hard band ( 2@xmath212 kev ) .",
    "the attitude reconstruction is crucial in the determination of source coordinates .",
    "after further investigation we concluded that during slews an attitude reconstruction slightly different than for pointed observations had to be performed .",
    "the optimal attitude file for reconstructing the astrometry in slew observations is the raw attitude file ( raf ) with 0.75 seconds subtracted from every entry , a timing error that is due to a delay of the star tracker ccds .",
    "systematic effects in the instrument and detection software lead to a number of spurious detections that are outlined below . in the current slew pipeline",
    "unreal sources due to optical loading and detector flashes are directly rejected during processing by using only single - pixel events ( pattern 0 ) below 0.5 kev .",
    "false detection : detections not verified through visual inspection . within bright and/or extended source : multiple detections of the same object .",
    "position suspect : sources located at the edge of an image and others .",
    "background related : sources positioned in localised flared images .",
    "images and exposure maps have been source searched for 219 slew observations producing 4179 detections in the total band ( fig .",
    "[ aitoff ] ) , 2750 in the soft band and 844 in the hard band .",
    "the number of real sources is under investigation as spurious detections are currently being flagged .",
    "the sky coverage is @xmath1  6300 square degrees which means @xmath1  15% of the whole sky , indicating a source density of about 0.65 sources per square degree .    in order to check the quality of our detections we correlated the 2178 non - extended sources with det_ml@xmath310 ( sigma @xmath43.9 ) with different catalogues .",
    "it was found that @xmath1  56% of the sources have a rass counterpart within 60 arcsec , with 68% of matches lying within 15 arcsec .",
    "furthermore , correlations with the astronomical database simbad show that 68% of the matches lie within 8 arcsec .",
    "these correlations also indicate a great variety of detected objects during slews , including agn , galaxies , cluster of galaxies , lmxb and snr among others .    the sensitivity of the survey in the different bands was obtained and flux limits at det_ml of 10(8 )",
    "were compared with those of other x - ray all - sky surveys ( fig .",
    "[ flux ] ) .",
    "the soft x - ray band detection limit is @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 , comparable to the one of the rosat bright source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of slew detections is particularly evident for the hard x - ray band whose limit is the deepest ever @xmath9 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 ( ten times deeper than exosat , heao-1 )",
    ".    all detected sources will comprise the first xmm - newton catalogue derived from slew observations , the xmm - newton slew 1 ( xmmsl1 ) .",
    "it is expected to be published by the end of 2005 and updated when more slews are available to finally have an all - sky survey ."
