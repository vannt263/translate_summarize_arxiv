    "however , some theoretical models , developed for the description of nonlinear optical response in bulk or 2d systems @xcite , may be successfully applied to the confined ( 0d ) case with discrete carrier spectrum . within such independent boson models it was possible to describe the linear@xcite and nonlinear@xcite response in the limit of infinitely short pulses and to account quantitatively@xcite for the short - time behavior of optical polarization observed in the time - resolved spectroscopy experiment @xcite .",
    "although the observed effects may be attributed only to acoustic phonons @xcite , the theory predicts also lo phonon effects for sufficiently short pulses @xcite .    due to the weak dispersion of lo modes",

    "experimental results for the bulk gaas @xcite suggest dominant role of the decay channel to zone - edge lo and transversal acoustical ( ta ) phonons , although another interpretation of the same data proposes a major contribution of the decay into two longitudinal acoustical ( la ) phonons @xcite .",

    "both characteristics ( in frequency and time domain ) are calculated within a single formalism , based on the green function technique , restricted to single - phonon effects ( which is a reasonable approximation in the weak coupling case at low temperatures ) but incorporating the contribution from optically inactive exciton states excited by nonadiabaticity of lo phonon dynamics @xcite .",
    "we show that the zone - edge decay of lo phonons manifests itself clearly in the spectral properties of the system for certain energy relations between the zone - center and zone - edge phonons .",
    "although these energy relations are a material feature under fixed conditions , in view of the existing uncertainty concerning the phonon anharmonicity channels it seems interesting to study all possible scenarios . moreover , even if the zone - edge process turns out to be forbidden at normal pressure , it is likely to appear at high pressures .",
    "indeed , the measured pressure ( volume ) dependence of phonon frequencies@xcite shows that the energy of the zone - center lo phonon increases with growing pressure , while the total energy of the zone - edge lo and ta phonon pair slowly decreases .",

    "the resulting excited two - particle states are either strictly optically inactive due to parity or almost inactive because the ground state electron and excited state hole wave functions are close to orthogonal even in absence of strict selection rules .",

    "we have further extended the description by incorporating contributions from optically inactive excited states .",
    "we have shown that the vicinity of the edge of density of final states leads to the appearance of long - living modes and to a deviation from the symmetric lorentzian line shape . in such case ,",
    "the decay time of the lo phonon beats becomes longer than @xmath147 , where @xmath146 is the measured decay time of the zone - center lo phonon population .",
    "this situation appears when the total energy of the @xmath18-point phonons ( lo@xmath99ta ) is only slightly lower ( by @xmath149 mev ) than the @xmath92-point lo phonon energy . on the other hand ,",
    "when this energy overlap becomes larger , the line shape becomes very close to lorentzian and the decay time of the lo phonon beats is shorter than @xmath147 , due to additional contribution from dispersion - induced dephasing .    in view of long coherence time of the undamped lo phonon oscillations ( due to weak dispersion ) , the line shapes of the phonon replicas and the time evolution of beats",
    "is always determined by the anharmonic damping processes .",
    "therefore , the damping effect must be included in any description of carrier - lo - phonon dynamics .",
    "moreover , in some special cases , the detailed structure of phonon bands may noticeably influence the measurable properties .",
    "it may therefore be possible to extract information about the anharmonic lo phonon damping channels from the qd spectroscopy data .",
    "although the phonon dispersion is obviously a material characteristics , it may be modified by changing the material composition and experimental conditions ( e.g. pressure ) , so a range of dynamical regimes might be observed .",
    "it may be expected that an actual experiment will be performed on the ensemble of dots by nonlinear optical techniques , e.g. four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) .",
    "it is known that the time - resolved fwm results can not be reproduced exactly by a linear spectrum or by a single pulse dynamics @xcite . unlike for the markovian dephasing effects , in the case of the lattice response related to pure dephasing after a fast excitation",
    "there is no simple relation between the spectra and time - resolved evolutions obtained in linear and nonlinear experiments .",
    "however much similarity still remains , due to the unique underlying physical effects .",
    "for instance , the variation of damping times and the non - lorentzian shape of the lo replica reflect the structure of the allowed final states for an anharmonic decay process and may be expected to appear in any kind of experiment .",
    "hence , the results obtained here are at least qualitatively relevant also for a nonlinear experiment , although an exact extension in this direction would certainly be desirable . another important generalization should consist in including final - length pulses @xcite .",
    "this paper has been supported by the polish ministry of scientific research and information technology under the ( solicited ) grant no pbz - min-008/p03/03 and by the polish kbn under grant no .",
