    "due to the symmetry with respect to the @xmath7 axis , we mainly characterize the in - plane shapes by two parameters ( see figure  [ fig : formes ] ) : the concavity at the rear @xmath71 and the fore - aft asymmetry @xmath72 .    in the experiments , vesicles of varying reduced volume @xmath43 and radius @xmath73",
    "were observed in channels of constant thickness @xmath8 and varying width @xmath10 under a flow of maximum velocity @xmath27 ( see pictures of figures 1 in the main paper ) . for a selection of tiny intervals of reduced volumes ,",
    "we plot in figures [ fig : asym](a - e ) and [ fig : conc](a - d ) the variations of @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath16 for vesicles under different confinement @xmath5 and capillary number @xmath6 that is varied either by changing @xmath27 or because of its @xmath5 dependency . in the data shown in figures [ fig : asym](a - e ) and [ fig : conc](a - d ) , @xmath5 varies by a factor higher than @xmath76 and @xmath6 by a factor 100 .",
    "in particular , in figures [ fig : asym](a ) and [ fig : conc](a ) , the same vesicle with @xmath77 in the square cross - section channel is observed around @xmath32 for velocities @xmath27 varying by a factor 100 , so that @xmath6 goes from 27 to 2654 in the square cross - section channel . in figures [ fig : asym](c ) and [ fig : conc](c ) , the same vesicle with @xmath78 is observed on a wider interval of @xmath16 for velocities @xmath27 varying by a factor 5 , so that @xmath6 goes from 17 to 87 .    for a given @xmath43 , the curves @xmath79 collapse reasonably well on a single one . in particular , @xmath74 varies by a factor 5 or 6 while @xmath16 varies typically from 1 to 1.5 while the residual variations around the master curve are much smaller even though @xmath5 varies by a factor 3 .",
    "this indicates that the asymmetry is controlled by the aspect ratio but not by the confinement ( within the limit @xmath80 ) . in the range @xmath52",
    ", it seems also that the @xmath6-dependency is weak .",
    "these facts suggest that the mean stress on the membrane ( which is linked to the mean confinement or to fluid velocity ) is not important , and that the stress distribution around the vesicle is the key parameter .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : asym](f ) shows the variations of asymmetry @xmath74 with @xmath16 for different reduced volumes .",
    "asymmetry is a decreasing function of @xmath16 : in - plane asymmetry is higher in the narrower longitudinal section of the channel . from the plateau observed at low @xmath16 , there seems to be a maximal possible asymmetry , which increases with deflation of vesicle , as one would expect .            like asymmetry",
    ", concavity is controlled by the aspect ratio of the channel since the curves @xmath81 fall down to 0 at the same critical @xmath49 ( concave @xmath82 convex crossover ) . for @xmath83 , no complete collapse",
    "is observed , but this can be linked to the fact that tension in the concave rear part is weak and the membrane is therefore submitted to higher thermal fluctuations and might be more sensitive to variations in the fluid velocity @xmath27 . + a vesicle shape is also characterized by its reduced width @xmath84 ( see figure [ fig : formes ] ) . as shown in figure [ fig : ellmax ]",
    ", @xmath85 is more or less constant whatever @xmath16 .",
    "surprisingly , deflated enough ( @xmath86 ) vesicles are even narrower when the aspect ratio increases , so when the in - plane confinement decreases .",
    "thus , in general , increasing the confinement does not lead to a in - plane shrinkage of the vesicle , so that the membrane is submitted to a lower flow stress , but only displaces the location @xmath74 of the maximum thickness to the rear .",
    "these results imply that , at the rear , the aspect ratio of the transverse cross - section of the vesicle is reversed compared to the channel aspect ratio .",
    "it is equal to 1 somewhere in the middle and , at the front , follows the same aspect ratio as the channel .",
    "these results lead to some comments on a previous study : in ref .",
    "@xcite we observed vesicles flowing in a channel of square cross - section .",
    "vesicles were observed by digital holographic microscopy , which allowed us to measure the optical thickness @xmath87 , where @xmath9 is the membrane position and @xmath88 the refractive index difference between the inner and the outer fluid .",
    "because @xmath16 was equal to 1 , we made the assumption of axisymmetry of the vesicle and from this information on @xmath9 we deduced values for the refractive index difference along the vesicle @xmath89 .",
    "strong gradients were observed , that increased with vesicle velocity and could lead to an increase by a factor 2 of the refractive index difference between the rear and the front of the vesicle , leading to the conclusion of the existence of huge gradients of sucrose concentration inside the vesicle .",
    "however , it was argued that , according to the permeability values found in the literature , difference of osmotic pressure across the membrane should prevent such important concentration gradients , even though residual flow across the permeable membrane due to hydrodynamic pressure difference could effectively lead to some sugar advection inside the vesicle ( whose membrane is not permeable to sugar ) .",
    "the observed gradients in @xmath90 were nevertheless attributed to concentration gradients because it was assumed that the vesicle shape should follow the channel s aspect ratio , even in case of small departure from the square section case .",
    "indeed , in these experiments , poor channel quality led us to estimate the uncertainty on @xmath16 to around 3% , that is , @xmath91 .",
    "we now know that it can lead to important variations of the vesicle s aspect ratio along the @xmath7 axis , because , as seen in figure [ fig : asym](e ) , @xmath74 variations are particularly strong around @xmath32 , while @xmath85 remains quasi constant .",
    "part of the observed gradients in ref .",
    "@xcite could therefore be attributed to these aspect ratio variations .",
    "in figure [ fig : shapes ] we show additional 3d shapes for vesicles at @xmath92 .",
    "tank - treading velocities at the surface are shown . in the axisymmetric case ,",
    "no movement is seen , but 4 vortices appear as soon as @xmath93 , for parachutes , bullets or croissants . for comparison , we calculated the shape and surface velocities for drops with no viscosity contrast and capillary number @xmath94",
    ". @xmath6 is defined by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the surface tension .",
    "note that the choice of the value @xmath6 value is arbitrary ( within the condition of low enough value to prevent break - up ) , as the very different nature of the interfaces makes any quantitative comparison between drops and vesicles tricky , even with similar capillary numbers .",
    "the flow patterns on the drop surface are completely different , with a front to rear movement even for @xmath32 , and no qualitative change in the asymmetric case , even if continuity of velocity field implies increased velocity in the plane of higher flow curvature ."
