    "the reduction of particle size can be achieved under many different conditions . in particular , the multiple breakage of crystals occurs during distinct research and technological processes such as , for instance , milling or recirculation loops .",
    "it is , in fact , a very complex phenomenon in which the quantity known as fragment size distribution function ( fsdf ) is relevant . in consequence ,",
    "the problem of finding the time - dependent fsdf ( tdfsdf ) corresponding to an event of solid multiple breakage , as a function of the main macroscopic measurable variables is of key interest in many areas .",
    "for instance , there are experimental reports on breakage rates @xcite , and on size distribution during particle abrasion @xcite",
    ". the usual theoretical approach can be found , in a much complete form , in the work by hill and ng @xcite , and more recently in the study published by yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide an alternative way to determine the tdfsdf in multiple breakage processes as a function of the relevant macroscopic variables .",
    "it is based on the use of a nonextensive statistical description , as it has been previously done in modeling the problems of fragmentation @xcite , cluster formation @xcite and particle size distribution @xcite .",
    "the original report on this particular version of the statistics is due to tsallis @xcite , who postulated a generalized form of the entropy that among other things intends to account for the frequent appearance of power - law phenomena in nature .    on the other hand ,",
    "the time evolution of the fragment distribution is presented as obeying a fractal - like kinetics @xcite .",
    "then , the combination of the nonextensive statistics and the fractal kinetics will allow to derive the expressions for the volume and characteristic length of fragments in breakage events .",
    "the paper is organized in such a way that the next section contains a detailed derivation of the distribution functions .",
    "then , the section iii is devoted to present and discuss the application of these functions in order to fit with available experimental data and , finally the section iv is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "if progressive particle fragmentation takes place within a liquid environment , then quantities such as shear rate and viscosity can be some of the macroscopic variables mentioned above . on the other hand , since the multiple particle breakage involves the effect of inertial impact with container walls or with another particles , it is possible to assume that the fragment mass and the shear rate must appear in the distribution function .",
    "the effect of attrition also determines the fragment size , so we also need to take into account the influence of viscosity . besides , both inertial impact and viscosity depend of fragment concentration .",
    "all these variables appear in [ 1 ] as the main factors governing the fsdf .",
    "the model considers the following quantities    * @xmath0mass of the fragments .",
    "* @xmath1shear rate ( gradient of the velocity ) * @xmath2liquid viscosity . *",
    "@xmath3number of fragments per unit volume .    if the basic dimensions entering this problem are mass ( @xmath4 ) , length ( @xmath5 ) , and time ( @xmath6 ) ( all positive , as noticed ) ; then , according to the vaschy - buckingham theorem @xcite , the law relating all these variables can be transformed to one which will include only one dimensionless variable .",
    "this provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters for the given variables even if the form of the equation is still unknown . }",
    "let us look at this statement core closely.the dimensions involved in the variables above listed are : @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ; @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , a single dimensionless quantity defined from them could be    @xmath11    thus , the problem of finding the distribution of volume ( mass ) , or fsdf , can be formulated as the derivation of the distribution function of the dimensionless variable @xmath12 .",
    "this can be accomplished using basic physics principles such as the second law of thermodynamics , which is nothing but a maximization of the system s entropy .    however , the breakage is a phenomenon with long - range correlation among different parts of the system , and the use of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy is not suitable in this case .",
    "when long - range correlation is relevant , it turns out that the use of the so - called tsallis entropy [ 2 ] reveals to be convenient . in its continuous version ,",
    "the form of this entropy ( in units of the boltzmann constant ) is :    @xmath13    in this expression , @xmath14 is the probability density function .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is known as the `` degree of non - extensivity '' and , in principle , can take any real value . with the use of the lhpital rule , it is possible to verify that , under the normalization condition    @xmath16    the limit when @xmath17 leads to the bg entropy .    the search for a maximum of @xmath18 must include some constraints .",
    "one of them is , precisely , the normalization condition    @xmath19    which is usual in the analysis of the bg case . in the integration ,",
    "the upper limit @xmath20 is the maximal value of the dimensionless variable @xmath12 , which corresponds to the maximal value of the mass of the fragments , @xmath4 , under stationary conditions for the remaining parameters .",
    "in other words , @xmath21 .    the second constraint is not that usual . in this case , it is customary to impose the finiteness of the so - called @xmath15-mean value , also named as the first - order @xmath15-moment :    @xmath22    and , then , the constrain condition should read @xmath23    the same limits of integration considered in ( 3)-(4 ) apply for the integral in the equation ( 2 ) .",
    "actually , integration limits should include a minimal fragment size that corresponds to the situation when the breakage process can not yield fragments of smaller dimensions .",
    "however , in order to simplify the treatment , our approach sets the lower integration limit as zero .",
    "under the constrains mentioned , the problem of finding the maximum of the entropy is no other than a lagrange multipliers one .",
    "so , we define the lagrange functional    @xmath24=s_q+\\alpha\\left ( \\int_0^a p(\\xi)\\,d\\xi-1 \\right ) + \\beta\\left ( \\int_0^a \\xi\\,p^{\\,q}(\\xi)\\,d\\xi-\\mu \\right ) , \\ ] ]    and demand the fulfillment of @xmath25    the result for the probability density function has the form    @xmath26^{-\\frac{1}{q-1}}.\\ ] ]    once the lagrange multipliers @xmath27 and @xmath28 are properly determined , the final expression for @xmath29 is :    @xmath30^{-\\frac{1}{q-1}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!;\\\\ p(\\xi)&=&\\left ( \\frac{2-q}{\\mu}\\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{2-q}}\\left [ 1-\\frac{\\xi}{a}\\right ] ^{-\\frac{1}{q-1}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      during the process of continuous breaking , the concentration of fragments of a given size varies",
    ". therefore , we must consider @xmath31 as a time - dependent variable .",
    "this dependence can be considered as if the fragments were a given species originated during the process .",
    "therefore , the problem will be to determine the kinetics of the fragments .    in a complex system ,",
    "a very general kinetic equation for a given species can be posed in the form of a `` fractal '' differential equation @xcite :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the reacting coefficient and @xmath34 is a fractional time index .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ kin ] ) is    @xmath35    and defines a kind of `` weibull kinetics '' , and is a result of our conjecture about the variation of the total number of fragments .",
    "if we name @xmath36 as the total volume of the system , then the density of the fragments of the n species is    @xmath37    if we set @xmath38 as the initial concentration , @xmath39 the crystal density , and @xmath40 the volume of the crystal fragment , it is possible to write    @xmath41    and , in correspondence , the time evolution of our dimensionless variable will be -according to ( [ evol ] ) :    @xmath42    within this context , the time - dependent probability density distribution function for the volume of the fragments can be written as :    @xmath43^c;\\mbox{\\hspace{5.6cm}}\\\\ { \\rm where}\\mbox{\\hspace{14.7cm}}\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega=\\left ( \\frac{2-q}{\\mu } \\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{2-q } } \\frac{\\rho\\dot{\\gamma}n_0}{\\eta}^{\\!\\!\\!1/3 } ; \\mbox{\\hspace{5.8cm}}\\\\ b=\\frac{q-1}{2-q } \\left ( \\frac{2-q}{\\mu}\\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{2-q}}\\frac{\\rho\\dot{\\gamma}n_0}{\\eta}^{\\!\\!\\!1/3 } ; \\mbox{\\hspace{4.6cm}}\\\\ c=\\frac{1}{1-q}. \\mbox{\\hspace{8.3cm}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is possible to notice that , written in the form ( [ chi - t ] ) , the time - dependent probability density function explicitly depends on the macroscopic measurable variables of the system .",
    "on the other hand , the integration of ( [ chi - t ] ) over the crystal volume , from zero to @xmath44 , defines the fraction of fragments with a volume size smaller that @xmath44 , in the system :    @xmath45    if the volume of the largest fragment , @xmath46 , is taken as the unity , one may clearly see that @xmath47 ; because any particle in the system will have a volume smaller than the maximal one .",
    "this provides a condition for the normalization of the distribution @xmath48 , so one obtains    @xmath49^{\\frac{2-q}{1-q } } } { 1-[1-b e^{at^\\nu}]^{\\frac{2-q}{1-q } } } \\label{fv}\\ ] ]    the distribution ( [ fv ] ) gives the fraction of the crystal particles that , at the time @xmath50 , have a volume smaller or equal to @xmath40 .",
    "now , if we look for a distribution in terms of the particle s characteristic length , @xmath51 , instead of volume , we state the cubic dependence of the particle volume with @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath53 .",

    "in order to test our model we fit the results of the particle diameter distribution of phosphate minerals reported as an outcome of a commercial particle size analyzer ( see ref .",

    "the procedure included stoping the agitation at certain intervals .",
    "then , the abrasion fragments were separated from the liquid to determine the total mass abraded and to measure size distribution .",
    "the counted particles were grouped into a number of size ranges in order to give a clearer representation of the changes of size distribution with time .",
    "we have , for instance : @xmath72 m ( range 1 ) ; @xmath73 m ( range 2 ) ; @xmath74 m ( range 3 ) . assuming a constant shape factor , the total particle mass in each of the ranges was calculated ( see both table 1 and figure 1 in ref .",
