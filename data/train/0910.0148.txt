    "in the last decade , shell - model calculations employing realistic effective interactions derived from modern nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) potentials have entered the main stream of nuclear structure theory @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the first problem one is confronted with in this kind of calculations is the strong short - range repulsion contained in the bare @xmath3 potential @xmath4 , which prevents its direct use in the derivation of the shell - model effective interaction @xmath5 . the most popular way to overcome",
    "this difficulty has long been the brueckner @xmath6-matrix method .",
    "however , a few years ago a new approach @xcite was proposed which consists in deriving from @xmath4 a low - momentum potential , @xmath0 , that preserves the deuteron binding energy and scattering phase shifts of @xmath4 up to a certain cutoff momentum @xmath7 .",
    "this is a smooth potential which can be used directly to derive @xmath5 , and it has been shown @xcite that it provides an advantageous alternative to the use of the @xmath6 matrix . in this connection , it should be mentioned that @xmath0 potentials are currently being used in various nuclear theory contexts , such as the study of few - body systems and no - core shell - model calculations @xcite .    making use of the @xmath0 approach ,",
    "we have recently studied  @xcite several nuclei beyond doubly magic @xmath1sn , showing that their properties are well accounted for by a unique shell - model hamiltonian with single - particle energies taken from experiment and two - body effective interaction derived from the cd - bonn @xmath3 potential @xcite .",
    "motivated by the very good results obtained in the @xmath1sn region and by the existence of a close resemblance  @xcite between the spectroscopy of this region and that of nuclei around stable @xmath2pb , we have found it challenging to perform a comparative study of these two regions @xcite . in this paper we present some results from this study , focusing attention on the proton - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - neutron multiplets in the three far - from - stability nuclei @xmath8te , @xmath8sn , @xmath8sb and in their counterparts in the @xmath2pb region , @xmath9po , @xmath9pb , and @xmath9bi .",
    "we start by giving an outline of the theoretical framework in which our shell - model calculations are performed and then present and discuss our results .",
    "a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "in the framework of the shell model an auxiliary one - body potential @xmath10 is introduced in order to break up the nuclear hamiltonian , written as the sum of the kinetic term and the @xmath3 potential , into a one - body component @xmath11 , which describes the independent motion of the nucleons , and a residual interaction @xmath12 .",
    "namely ,    @xmath13    a reduced model space is then defined in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath11 and the diagonalization of the original hamiltonian @xmath14 in an infinite hilbert space is reduced to the solution of an eigenvalue problem for an effective hamiltonian @xmath15 in a finite space",
    ".    the hamiltonian @xmath15 can be derived by way of the @xmath16-box folded - diagram expansion ( see ref .",
    "this implies as first step the calculation of the so - called @xmath16-box , which is made up of an infinite collection of irreducible and valence - linked goldstone diagrams .",
    "once the @xmath16-box has been calculated at a given order , the infinite series of the folded diagrams has to be summed up . from this procedure",
    "an effective hamiltonian is obtained containing both one- and two - body components .",
    "usually , only the two - body term @xmath5 is retained , while the one - body contributions , representing the theoretical single - particle energies , are subtracted and replaced with single - particle energies taken from experiment  @xcite .    however , as mentioned in the introduction no modern @xmath3 potential can be used in a perturbative nuclear structure calculation , unless its strong repulsive core is firstly `` smoothed out '' . here",
    ", we do not embark on any discussion of how the effective hamiltonian is derived , and refer to  @xcite , where a detailed description of the whole procedure can be found .",
    "rather , in the following we focus on the @xmath0 approach .",
    "we first outline the essential steps for the derivation of the @xmath0 based on the lee - suzuki similarity transformation method  @xcite , and then describe its main features .    let us consider the similarity transformation on the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] )    @xmath17    where the operator @xmath18 is defined in the whole hilbert space .",
    "we now introduce a cutoff momentum @xmath7 that separates fast and slow modes to the end of deriving from the original @xmath4 a low - momentum potential satisfying a decoupling condition between the low- and high - momentum spaces .",
    "the low - momentum space is specified by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the two - nucleon relative momentum , and the decoupling equation reads    @xmath21    with @xmath22 being the complementary fast - mode space .",
    "the low - momentum hamiltonian is then given by    @xmath23    and it can be easily proved that its eigenvalues are a subset of the eigenvalues of the original hamiltonian .",
    "there are , of course , different choices for the transformation operator @xmath18 .",
    "we take @xmath24    where the wave operator @xmath25 satisfies the conditions : @xmath26 @xmath27    the former implying that @xmath28    from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) the low - momentum potential @xmath0 can be defined as @xmath29 employing transformation ( [ omegaop1 ] ) , this equation is written as @xmath30 while eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) becomes @xmath31    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ deceq2 ] ) gives the value of @xmath25 needed to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "this decoupling equation can be solved by means of the iterative technique for non - degenerate model spaces proposed in @xcite , which is now sketched .",
    "we define the operators :    @xmath32    in terms of which one can write    @xmath33    once the iterative procedure has converged , @xmath34 , the operator @xmath25 is given by    @xmath35    in applying this method , we have employed a momentum - space discretization procedure making use of an adequate number of gaussian mesh points @xcite .    it is worth mentioning that the equation for @xmath36 obtained using the similarity transformation of lee and suzuki is the same as that one can derive from the @xmath37-matrix equivalence approach  @xcite .",
    "this means that the obtained low - momentum potential not only preserves the deuteron binding energy given by the original @xmath3 potential , but also its low - momentum ( @xmath38 ) half - on - shell @xmath37 matrix .",
    "the above @xmath0 is however not hermitian , which is not convenient for various applications , as for instance its use in the derivation of shell - model effective interactions .",
    "this @xmath0 may be transformed by means of the familiar schmidt orthogonalization procedure , which leads to a hermitian new @xmath0 . as suggested in  @xcite , another transformation , based on the cholesky decomposition of a symmetric and positive definite matrix ,",
    "can be used to this end .",
    "in fact , the matrix @xmath39 , being symmetric and positive definite , admits this decomposition , @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a lower triangular matrix and @xmath42 its transpose . since @xmath41 is real matrix defined within the @xmath43-space , we may write our transformation as @xmath44    and the corresponding hermitian @xmath0 is @xmath45    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that this hermitian interaction , as well all the family of hermitian interactions which can derived from @xmath0 by means of different transformations , preserve the full - on - shell @xmath37 matrix , and consequently the phase shifts of the original @xmath4 .",
    "the so - obtained @xmath0 is a smooth potential that can be used directly within the @xmath16-box folded diagram theory to derive the shell - model effective interaction .",
    "actually , it represents an advantageous alternative to the @xmath6-matrix approach owing to the fact that it does not depend either on the energy or on the model space .",
    "this is at variance with the @xmath6 matrix , which is defined in the nuclear medium . in this connection",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the merit of the @xmath0 within the context of realistic shell - model calculations has been assessed by several studies evidencing that @xmath0 results are as good , or even slightly better than , the @xmath6-matrix ones @xcite .",
    "finally , it is a remarkable feature of the @xmath0 approach that different @xmath3 potentials lead to low - momentum potentials , which are quite similar to each other @xcite .",
    "( a ) proton - proton @xmath46 multiplet in @xmath8te.(b ) proton - proton @xmath47 multiplet in @xmath9po .",
    "the theoretical results are represented by open circles while the experimental data by solid triangles . ]",
    "in this paper , we present some results of our current shell - model study of nuclei with two valence nucleons in the @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb regions , which have been obtained starting from the cd - bonn potential renormalized by use of a @xmath0 with a cutoff momentum of @xmath48 @xmath49 .    in our calculations for @xmath8te , @xmath8sn , and @xmath8sb we assume that the the valence protons occupy the five levels @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 of the @xmath55 shell , while for the neutrons the model space includes the six levels @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 of the @xmath62 shell .",
    "similarly , for @xmath9po , @xmath9pb , and @xmath9bi we take as model space for the valence protons the six levels of the @xmath62 shell and let the valence neutrons occupy the seven levels @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the @xmath70 shell .",
    "as regards the adopted single - particle neutron and proton energies , they can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in section  2 , the two - body matrix elements of the effective interaction are derived within the framework of the @xmath16-box folded - diagram expansion .",
    "we include in the @xmath16-box all diagrams up to second order in the interaction , given by the @xmath0 potential plus the coulomb force for protons .",
    "these diagrams are computed within the harmonic - oscillator basis using intermediate states composed of all possible hole states and particle states restricted to the five proton and neutron shells above the fermi surface .",
    "the oscillator parameter is 7.88 mev for @xmath71 region and 6.88 mev for the @xmath72 region , as obtained from the expression @xmath73 .",
    "the calculations have been performed by using the nushellx code  @xcite .      in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ,",
    "we present the experimental  @xcite and calculated excitation energies of the lowest states in the nuclei with two - proton , two - neutron , and one proton - one neutron beyond doubly magic @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb .",
    "we see that the agreement between theory and experiment is very good for all six nuclei considered , the discrepancies being well below 100  kev for most of the states .",
    "all the calculated states reported in these figures are dominated by a single configuration , whose percentage ranges from 80% to 100% .",
    "in particular , they correspond to the proton - proton multiplets @xmath74 and @xmath75 in @xmath8te and @xmath9po , to the neutron - neutron multiplets @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath8sn and @xmath9pb , and to the proton - neutron multiplets @xmath76 and @xmath77 in @xmath8sb and @xmath9bi .",
    "these figures evidence the striking resemblance between the behavior of the multiplets in the three pairs of counterpart nuclei , @xmath8te and @xmath9po , @xmath8sn and @xmath9pb , @xmath8sb and @xmath9bi .",
    "we may only note that the curves relative to the @xmath2pb neighbors are generally located slightly below those for the counterpart nuclei in @xmath1sn region .",
    "in particular , from figures  3a and 3b we see that the two proton - neutron multiplets show a sizable energy gap between the @xmath78 state and the nearly degenerate @xmath79 and @xmath80 states , as well as a distinctive staggering , with the same magnitude and phase , between the odd and the even members starting from the @xmath81 state . as regards the two - identical - particle multiplets , figures  1 and 2 show four curves having all the same shape .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the curves for the two - valence - proton nuclei are located in an energy interval larger than that pertaining to the two - valence - neutron nuclei .",
    "this means that in both @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb regions a weakening of the pairing gap exists for nuclei with two - valence neutrons with respect to those with two - valence protons .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the resemblance between @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb regions was first pointed out by blomqvist@xcite , who noticed that every @xmath1sn single - proton and -neutron level , characterized by quantum numbers @xmath82 , has its counterpart around @xmath2pb with quantum numbers @xmath83 .",
    "however , until recent years the scarcity of information for nuclei around @xmath1sn , which lies well away from the stability line , has prevented a detailed comparative study of the two regions .",
    "nowadays , new data have become available which support the similarity between their spectroscopies . in our calculation , this similarity emerges quite naturally from our effective interaction which we have derived from a realistic @xmath3 potential .",
    "( a ) neutron - neutron @xmath84 multiplet in @xmath8sn.(b ) neutron - neutron @xmath75 multiplet in @xmath9pb .",
    "the theoretical results are represented by open circles while the experimental data by solid triangles . ]",
    "( a ) proton - neutron @xmath76 multiplet in @xmath8sb.(b ) proton - neutron @xmath77 multiplet in @xmath9bi .",
    "the theoretical results are represented by open circles while the experimental data by solid triangles . ]",
    "we have briefly discussed here the theoretical framework for realistic shell - model calculations wherein use is made of low - momentum interactions derived from the free @xmath3 potential .",
    "we have shown how a smooth low - momentum potential @xmath0 can be constructed , which preserves the deuteron binding energy and scattering phase shifts of the original @xmath4 up to a given momentum cutoff .",
    "we have then presented the results of a shell - model study of nuclei around doubly magic @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb , focusing attention on proton - proton , neutron - neutron and proton - neutron multiplets .",
    "the results obtained for the three nuclei @xmath8te , @xmath8sn and @xmath8sb have been compared with those for @xmath9po , @xmath9pb and @xmath9bi , which are their counterparts in the region of @xmath2pb . in both cases ,",
    "a low - momentum effective interaction derived from the cd - bonn @xmath3 potential has been employed .",
    "it should be stressed that no adjustable parameter appears in our calculations .",
    "our results for all six nuclei are in very good agreement with the experimental data and account for the striking resemblance between the behavior of the multiplets in the @xmath1sn and @xmath2pb regions .",
    "this stimulates further studies to find out whether this resemblance extends beyond the two - valence - particle nuclei .",
