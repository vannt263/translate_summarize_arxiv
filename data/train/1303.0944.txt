    "a possible approach for dealing with the intractability of a given decision or optimization problem is to identify restrictions on input instances under which the problem can still be solved efficiently .",
    "one generic framework for describing a kind of such restrictions in case of graph problems is the following : given a graph @xmath0 , does @xmath0 admit non - negative integer weights on its vertices ( or edges , depending on the problem ) and a set @xmath1 of integers such that a subset @xmath2 of its vertices ( or edges ) has property @xmath3 if and only if the sum of the weights of elements of @xmath2 belongs to @xmath1 ?",
    "property @xmath3 can denote any of the desired substructures we are looking for , such as matchings , cliques , stable sets , dominating sets , etc .",
    "if weights as above exist and are given with the graph , and the set @xmath1 is given by a membership oracle , then a dynamic programming algorithm can be employed to find a subset with property @xmath3 of either maximum or minimum cost ( according to a given cost function on the vertices / edges ) in @xmath4 time and with @xmath5 calls of the membership oracle , where @xmath6 is the number of vertices ( or edges ) of @xmath0 and @xmath5 is a given upper bound for @xmath1  @xcite .    the advantages of the above framework depend both on the choice of property @xmath3 and on the constraints ( if any ) imposed on the structure of the set @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 denotes the property of being a stable ( independent ) set , and set @xmath1 is restricted to be an interval unbounded from below ",
    "equivalently , @xmath1 is of the form of the form @xmath7 $ ] for some non - negative integer @xmath8 , we obtain the class of _ threshold graphs _",
    "@xcite , which is very well understood and admits several characterizations and linear time algorithms for recognition and for several optimization problems  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath3 denotes the property of being a dominating set and @xmath1 is an interval unbounded from above , that is , it is of the form @xmath9 for some non - negative integer @xmath8 , we obtain the class of _ domishold graphs _",
    "@xcite , which enjoy similar properties as the threshold graphs . on the other hand , if @xmath3 is the property of being a _ maximal _ stable set and @xmath1",
    "is restricted to consist of a single number , we obtain the class of _ equistable graphs _",
    "@xcite , for which the recognition complexity is open ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , no structural characterization is known , and several @xmath10-hard optimization problems remain intractable on this class . for instance , it is shown in  @xcite that the maximum independent set and the minimum independent dominating set problems are apx - hard in the class of equistable graphs .",
    "as the above examples show , the resulting class of graphs can be either _ hereditary _ ( that is , closed under vertex deletion)as in the case of threshold or domishold graphs , or not  as in the case of equistable graphs . when the resulting graph class is not hereditary , it is natural to consider the hereditary version of the property , in which the requirement ( the existence of weights and the set @xmath1 ) is extended to all induced subgraphs of the given graph .    in this paper",
