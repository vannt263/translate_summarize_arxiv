    "@xcite explain down - bending disc breaks with stellar angular momentum redistribution induced by the formation of a bar .",
    "a study by @xcite that also employed numerical simulations predicted ` u - shaped ' stellar age profiles for down - bending disc breaks and that the positions of the minima of the age profiles coincide with the break radius .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by observations @xcite .",
    "there are many analytical models in the literature that study the physical origin of the exponential radial profile of stellar galaxy discs @xcite .",
    "a common assumption of all these models is that the distribution of specific angular momentum of baryons is conserved during the evolution of galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that low angular momentum material needs to be removed in order to prevent centres of galaxies from becoming too dense .",
    "he suggested that stellar feedback is a viable mechanism to redistribute angular momentum .",

    "first , star formation extends to much larger radii ( @xmath60 kpc ) . secondly , despite the same qualitative trend the differences between the formation and final profiles are much smaller .",
    "the final profile closely follows the formation profile out to @xmath61 kpc and there is no central core in the formation profile . at large radii",
    "there is a steeply declining tail of stars that have reached large radii , leading to the down - bending profile .",

    "the intermediate cases show a monotonic trend between those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_birth_radii ] .",
    "using numerical models of disc galaxy formation , we found a correlation between the initial spin of the host halo and the shape of the radial profile of the stellar disc .",
    "we find that galaxies with an initial spin parameter @xmath62 form an up - bending disc profile while larger values of @xmath2 yield down - bending discs .",
    "pure exponential discs occur only right at @xmath1 which coincides approximately with the median of the @xmath2 distribution in cosmological simulations ( @xmath63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , our model explains why only some late - type galaxies exhibit pure exponential disc profiles , while the majority of them show breaks in the outer disc profiles . as the transition between up- and down - bending disc profiles ( @xmath53 ) in our model coincides with the median of the @xmath2 distribution ,",
    "we expect roughly equal abundances of up- and down - bending profiles which are comparable but not equal to observational results ( 30 % and 60 % ; * ? ? ?",
    "a possible cause for this discrepancy between our model and observations is that gas in cosmological simulations generally has larger angular momentum than the dm @xcite .",
