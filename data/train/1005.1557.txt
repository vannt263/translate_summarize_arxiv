    "is not sufficient to answer the question whether the magnetic field will grow further or not .",
    "the most widespread point of view is that the magnetic field causes such a reconstruction of the flow that the generation of the magnetic field becomes less efficient .",
    "however , the visual control of the flow does not reveal an essential change @xcite , which can be due to the force - free nature of the magnetic field configurations : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy - carrying scale of the magnetic field .",
    "one of the explanations of the saturation mechanism is offered in @xcite , where saturation is connected with the scale separation of the generated magnetic field due to conservation of magnetic helicity . in the present paper",

    "one of the explanations of the growth of @xmath62 for regime r1 is that the magnetic field disturbs the regular geostrophic flow for r1 and helps the generation of the magnetic field .",

    "regime r2 corresponds to the more disturbed state , and the kinetic energy is reduced to the amount of increase of the magnetic energy .",
    "this scenario usually takes place for large reynolds numbers . note",
    "also that , while for r1 the increase of @xmath54 corresponds to the increase of the archimedean work @xmath64 , for r2 the work decreases due to the chaotization of the fields .",

    "any local change is possible only due to the redistribution of @xmath79 , @xmath91 over the scales .",
    "of course , this approach becomes more complicated , if the mean helicities change sign in space , and the ideas on scale decomposition are applicable to the space domain with the same sign of helicity .",
    "the application of the pseudo - vacuum boundary conditions , which provides @xmath92 at the boundaries , is more tricky .",

    "@xcite these formulas are applicable when the typical time of the large - scale magnetic field growth @xmath101 is larger than the turnover kinetic time @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a velocity on scale @xmath104 . a rough estimate of @xmath101 , using jump of the magnetic energy at the kinematic regime r1 , ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , yields @xmath105 , which is already smaller than @xmath106 ( here we supposed that the kinetic energy is concentrated in the vicinity of @xmath107 ) .",

    "this happens because the scales where energy is generated and dissipated are different @xcite .",
    "for the simplest cases , such as 3d kolmogorov s turbulence , kinetic energy goes from the scale of the force to the the dissipative scale .",
