    "integrated optics is becoming one of the most important platforms for the production of compact , scalable , linear optical quantum devices @xcite .",
    "much of this progress derives from the use of laser - defined waveguides in glass or polymer , which enables compact three - dimensional waveguide geometries to be designed and rapidly prototyped @xcite .",
    "whilst these devices are clearly important for scientific applications , they are not compatible with standard lithographic processes and are limited in the topologies that can be considered .",
    "direct write waveguides rely on serial material modification which places limitations on the complexity of the waveguide system designs that can be achieved . as a result ,",
    "most geometries rely on evanescent coupling of nearest neighbours .",
    "it has recently been shown that long range coupling can be achieved through utilisation of lateral leakage radiation in thin , shallow ridge silicon photonic waveguides @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that the ability to break free from the limitations of simply connected waveguide topologies offers new opportunities for the realisation of complex , multi - port quantum gates .",
    "one of the most fundamental elements required for integrated optical devices , especially quantum devices , is the beamsplitter .",
    "this is the essential element for any interferometer , and can also be used ( with trivial phase control ) to effect a hadamard rotation @xcite . in the two - photon subspace",
    ", the beamsplitter can show the hong - ou - mandel effect @xcite , one of the clearest non - trivial experiments to highlight the fundamental differences between classical and quantum optics . in integrated optics , a beamsplitter is typically realised through the use of a directional coupler .",
    "this is a device where two waveguides are brought into close proximity so that evanescent coupling causes population to tunnel between the waveguides . truncating the device to the appropriate length",
    "then effects the desired beam splitting ratio .",
    "although , in principle , it should be relatively easy to build such devices ; in practice , any lack of control in the actual waveguide size leads to a lack of control in the evanescent tunnelling , and hence the length of device required to achieve a particular beam splitting ratio will be effectively unknown .",
    "a common solution is to post - select devices from a suite of similar devices , or alternatively , phase shifting elements such as heaters , can be used to fine tune and reconfigure devices @xcite .",
    "adiabatic passage promises a solution to issues of device variability that require post - fabrication tuning .",
    "this is because adiabatic evolution goes as the ratio of tunnel matrix elements , rather than the absolute value of those elements .",
    "the tradeoff is that adiabatic devices are typically longer than their non - adiabatic counterparts , and whether the rewards of seeking an adiabatic vs non - adiabatic device are justified depends on the degree of device control required and the available footprint .",
    "adiabatic methods for transport of population between states of the kind we envisage here began with the stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) protocol @xcite , where robust transfer of population between atomic energy levels is effected by laser control , and the all - spatial variant that is sometimes called ctap ( coherent tunnelling adiabatic passage ) @xcite .",
    "here we explore theoretically the potential for effecting geometric gates via long - range ctap in thin , shallow ridge silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) waveguides , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : tripod ] ( a ) .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate several important gate designs including 50:50 beamsplitter and 1/3:2/3 beamsplitter , using a spatial version of the method outlined by unanyan , shore and bergmann ( usb ) @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed for both one and two photon input states .",
    "further , we concatenate these devices to show an adiabatic non - deterministic cnot gate , following the approach described by ralph _",
    "our scheme utilises a long - range common bus mode present in thin , shallow ridge waveguide devices @xcite .",
    "this common bus mode provides a significant , new opportunity to develop planar geometries which are nonetheless not restricted to linear nearest - neighbour coupling . in this way",
    ", we see our approach as being more amenable to mass production , especially cmos compatible fabrication , than truly three - dimensional approaches such as those described in , for example , references  @xcite .    , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ,",
    "are coupled to a single excited state @xmath2 via optical fields with rabi frequencies @xmath3 for the transition between @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the waveguide modes are equivalent to the ground states of the tripod atom , whilst the shared bus mode plays the role of the excited state.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first provide a brief introduction to thin , shallow ridge soi waveguides , with emphasis on their effective refractive index and coupling to slab modes .",
    "as will be shown , control of both the magnitude _ and _ the sign of the coupling between waveguides and the slab can be achieved by the position of the waveguide relative to the slab mode . a change in the sign of the coupling leads to symmetry breaking mechanisms that are essential for usb - style geometric gates . with this understanding",
    ", we generate an effective hamiltonian that can be used to effect arbitrary geometric gate sequences , and in particular we describe methodologies to realise an adiabatic power splitter , a hadamard gate and 1/3:2/3 beamsplitter via the usb approach . after demonstrating one - qubit gates",
    ", we show the extension to two - photon gates , in particular showing that the well - known hong - ou - mandel effect is preserved under conditions of adiabatic passage .",
    "finally , we show the full state evolution for a non - deterministic linear optical controlled gate operating in the coincidence basis .",
    "this non - trivial two - photon , two - qubit entangling gate is completely simulated across eight optical modes ( seven waveguide modes plus one bus mode ) , each of which can potentially have either 0 , 1 or 2 photons .",
    "thin , shallow ridge soi waveguides when operating in tm polarisation can exhibit lateral leakage behaviour @xcite .",
    "photons in a tm guided mode can leak into a lateral unguided te slab mode , propagating at a specific angle to the waveguide axis due to polarisation conversion at the ridge side - walls @xcite .",
    "this te slab mode can act as a bus mode to allow long - range communication between isolated waveguides @xcite .",
    "when the silicon slab is terminated , the continuum of te slab radiation is discretised into discrete te slab modes . on careful selection of the slab width ,",
    "one of these te slab modes can be phase - matched to the tm guided mode .",
    "thus , the photons from the guided tm mode can couple to this te slab mode .",
    "one particular method for varying the strength of the coupling between the guided tm mode and te slab mode is by varying the relative location of the ridge waveguide on the slab @xcite .",
    "this technique opens up a new class of coupler that can enable interactions between multiple , well separated waveguides simultaneously , which is not possible in a traditional planar evanescent arrangement and has recently been proposed for ctap devices @xcite .",
    "whilst here we only consider interactions mediated via a single , discrete slab mode for clarity , generalising our method so that coupling is via continuum states should be possible following the methods in references @xcite .    considering a discrete silicon slab supporting a laterally defined bus mode @xmath2 with propagation constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 forward propagating waveguide modes @xmath4 of @xmath7 with effective index @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the free space wavevector for wavelength @xmath10 . under these definitions , we may write down the system using a tight - binding hamiltonian in second quantised form as :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 @xmath13 is the photon annihilation ( creation ) operator acting on mode @xmath4 for @xmath14 .",
    "each waveguide is mutually isolated by separating an appropriate distance , ensuring there is no appreciable evanescent coupling , so that the waveguides only communicate through the common bus .",
    "the strength of this coupling ( @xmath15 ) is controlled by translating the waveguides laterally across the slab and this response is sinusoidal due to the nature of the bus mode @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a single waveguide to the bus is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lateral waveguide location , assuming isolation occurs in the centre of the slab .",
    "the lateral waveguide dimension in turn varies as a function of the propagation dimension , @xmath18 , which is the mechanism to effect the adiabatic passage .",
    "the relationship between the lateral ( @xmath17 ) and forward propagation ( @xmath18 ) dimensions is controlled so that the couplings are varied adiabatically .",
    "the maximum coupling ( @xmath19 ) available depends on the waveguide dimensions @xcite and can be calculated as the overlap integral between the bare bus te and waveguide tm modes .",
    "this magnitude is represented as the imaginary effective index of a tm - te coupled mode on an open slab @xcite , or in the discrete case by observing the level of mode splitting throughout translation @xcite . in the case where the slab width increases to accommodate additional waveguides , it is expected that this coupling will decrease as the maximal overlap of the single bus mode at any point decreases , resulting in longer devices .",
    "this scalability is of importance when considering more general morris - shore type devices @xcite .    in the discussion that follows we will adopt two separate notations . when we consider only the one - photon subspace",
    ", we will use the compact notation of defining the basis states by the position of the photon , i.e. we define @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum state of the system .",
    "however , when we deal with two - photon states , we will define the states by the occupation numbers of each mode , so for example the state @xmath22 .",
    "all of our simulations use a tight binding approach to solving the spatially varying hamiltonian , and do not assume that the adiabatic limit is achieved .",
    "adiabatic techniques can be used for power division applications either by fractional adiabatic passage @xcite or the use of additional waveguide modes @xcite .",
    "the presence of a shared bus offers an intriguing alternative technique .",
    "we first consider three waveguides acting as a tripod atom connected via a bus state ( figure [ fig : tripod ] ) , the bus can be designed to be degenerate with the individual isolated waveguides , which will result in improved adiabaticity .",
    "all of our modelling was performed using the tight - binding hamiltonian of equation  [ eq : ham ] and was conducted in the adiabatic limit .    here",
    "we wish to inject light into port @xmath1 and arrive in an even superposition of both @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "the position of each waveguide is selected to provide ideal initial ctap conditions [ @xmath24 . by translating the waveguides linearly across the slab , as illustrated in figure [ fig : ps](a ) , the couplings are varied sinusoidally to effect the counter - intuitive pulse sequence . in particular , we have @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] shown in figure [ fig : ps](b ) .",
    "the @xmath27 coupling scheme has the nice property that the adiabaticity is constant throughout the protocol @xcite .",
    "as @xmath28 and @xmath29 remain identical , an even power split arrives in each waveguide with the populations throughout the protocol described in figure [ fig : ps](c ) . combining the predicted paths , calculated population values and expected gaussian mode profile of the waveguides gives a more visual representation of this transfer ( figure [ fig : ps](d ) ) .",
    "this one input - two output device is equivalent to a y - splitter but without the conventional restrictions of close proximity or ordering of the waveguides .",
    "there is therefore enhanced flexibility with the bus approach than more conventional approaches .",
    "this technique can also be extended to distribute population evenly across many waveguides in a method akin to that in reference @xcite .",
    "the overall device length required to perform a successful adiabatic passage depends on @xmath19 .",
    "the waveguide dimensions specified in @xcite provided a coupling length of 150 @xmath30 m for a single waveguide and bus .",
    "it was shown that device lengths of @xmath31 mm were required to successfully achieve robust adiabatic transport between two waveguides using the long - range bus , without significant population of the bus .",
    "this implies that to achieve successful ctap behaviour the total device length must be at least longer than 15 coupling lengths .",
    "the magnitude of maximum coupling @xmath19 can be enhanced through waveguide engineering @xcite .",
    "increasing the available coupling will decrease the coupling length and hence reduce the absolute device length @xmath32 required to maintain adiabaticity , although such optimisation is not critical to explain our concepts .    , where the parameters for each waveguide are coloured consistently as green @xmath33 , red @xmath34 and purple @xmath35 , the population of the bus mode ( @xmath2 ) is blue ; ( a ) positioning the waveguide centres to provide counter - intuitive multiple waveguide population transfer , the sidebar to the right shows the magnitude of the sinusoidal coupling between the waveguides and the slab mode , based on the modal overlap .",

    "( c ) modal population of all states throughout system evolution shows 50:50 power division to output waveguides .",

    "the method of power splitting can be modified to effect robust quantum gates via the usb method @xcite . in this process , a double application of the power division is applied , with a change in the sign of the coupling applied between the first and second applications of the splitting .",
    "because of the standing wave nature of the bus mode , the coupling between the waveguide and the slab varies sinusoidally with the waveguide position .",
    "the sinusoidal variation means that the sign of the coupling reverses in each standing - wave period . by ensuring that the forward and backward adiabatic passage crosses periods with the appropriate signs , the necessary symmetry breaking that is at the heart of the usb process can be achieved by waveguide translation alone .    in the one - photon subspace ,",
    "the quantum gate is specified without loss of generality to act on qubit subspace of @xmath23 and @xmath0 , with @xmath1 as an auxiliary mode , explained below .",
    "we assume that the system is initialised in an arbitrary superposition @xmath36 , and for convenience we express the qubit in the dark / bright state basis ,    @xmath37    note that provided the ratio of the couplings remains constant , the compositions of the dark and bright states will not change .",
    "ideally @xmath38 remains completely isolated from @xmath2 , whilst @xmath39 can be influenced using ctap .",
    "the counter - intuitive sequence transfers @xmath40 , instigating a phase reversal of @xmath39 before returning it will alter the superposition , performing a rotation of the single qubit .",
    "the magnitude of this rotation is set by @xmath41 , and the net effect of a double application of the adiabatic passage is the gate : @xmath42 .",

    "preparing the system with all population initially in @xmath23 , the waveguides are translated to provide counter - intuitive transfer to @xmath1 , @xmath43 then goes negative transferring back to @xmath23 and @xmath0 ( figure [ fig:3-phase](a)-(b ) ) . translating all waveguides linearly ( @xmath44 ) results in complete population transfer to @xmath0 ( figure [ fig:3-phase](c ) ) .",
    "performing this operation takes the system from @xmath45 , which is an x - gate : the quantum equivalent of a not gate . the trajectory taken by the population",
    "is also depicted on the sphere shown in figure  [ fig:3-phase](d ) .",
    "this qutrit representation displays only the real part of the state amplitudes @xcite     and @xmath1 are unchanged in each case , where the different gate operations are provided by altering the trajectory of @xmath0 which is represented as red ( dashed ) , blue ( dot - dashed ) and cyan ( plus markers ) for @xmath461 , 0.4142 and 0.5176 respectively , ( b ) the coupling of @xmath1 is now allowed to turn negative instigating a break in the symmetry of forward and backwards paths , ( c ) @xmath44 operates as a not gate completely transferring population from @xmath47 , ( d ) qutrit representation showing the forward ( blue ) and backwards ( red ) dotted paths taken through evolution , ( e)-(f ) @xmath48 conforms to a hadamard operation creating a 50:50 superposition of @xmath23 and @xmath0 , ( g)-(h ) @xmath49 creates a 1/3:2/3 beamsplitter . ]    other gate operations occur when @xmath50 .",
    "the available gates are confined to rotations in the canonical x - z plane for the qubit defined across modes @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "if we define the trajectory of the state with greatest coupling to be linear , i.e. so that the coupling between this waveguide and the slab is sinusoidal and maximal , then it follows that the other must trace out a curved trajectory .",
    "so without loss of generality , assuming @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 .",
    "the hadamard gate is a commonly used quantum information primitive , and is equivalent ( up to phase ) to a conventional beamsplitter . preparing the system entirely in @xmath23",
    "a successful hadamard operation will result in the state being transformed to @xmath53 . using ( [ eq : g ] ) , a value of @xmath54 provides this behaviour .",
    "the waveguide trajectories required to provide this value of @xmath55 are shown in figure [ fig:3-phase](a ) , with the resulting coupling scheme in figure [ fig:3-phase](b ) .",
    "evolving this system adiabatically results in the expected hadamard operation as demonstrated in figure [ fig:3-phase](e)-(f ) .",
    "another important beamsplitter is the 1/3:2/3 beamsplitter .",
    "beamsplitters with this splitting ratio form the basis for non - deterministic linear optical quantum computing @xcite .",
    "a suitable two port 1/3:2/3 beam splitter is designed with @xmath49 and operation is shown in figure [ fig:3-phase](g)-(h ) .",
    "there are few studies that have explicitly considered adiabatic passage of more than one particle @xcite , without invoking some mean - field or other effective treatment ( as in for example references .",
    "we are not aware of any previous works that consider adiabatic multi - particle gates such as we describe here , and hence some explanation of the two - photon gate operation is required .",
    "the one - photon calculations described above are indistinguishable from the results that would be obtained for a purely classical modal analysis .",
    "although the operation of the adiabatic gates on two - photon states is exactly what should be predicted from an equivalent conventional device , the microscopic details of how the adiabatic device achieves two - photon interactions is interesting and non - trivial .        for two photons across four modes ( three waveguides + one bus mode ) ,",

    "the hamiltonian of the two - photon states is spanned by a four - dimensional null space comprising the ( unnormalised ) vectors @xmath66    with this four - dimensional null space , it is difficult to gain insight into the exact properties of the null state for any given problem , but there are some important features that can be gleaned .",
