    "oh megamasers ( ohms ) are rare luminous 18  cm masers associated with major galaxy merger - induced starbursts .",
    "the hosts of ohms are ( ultra)luminous ir galaxies ( [ u]lirgs ) , and the ohm fraction in ( u)lirgs peaks at about 1/3 in the highest luminosity mergers @xcite .",
    "it is not known whether all major mergers experience an ohm stage or what detailed physical conditions produce ohms , but it is clear that ohms are a radically different phenomenon from the aggregate oh maser emission associated with `` normal '' ( galactic ) modes of star formation in galaxies . @xcite posed a key question : why do @xmath7 of lirgs show no ohm activity ? to reframe the question : given two merging systems with similar global ir and radio continuum properties in the same morphological stage of merging , why does one show ohm emission while the other does not ? what is the difference between the two systems ? perhaps there is no difference and the fraction of ohms among mergers simply reflects beaming or oh abundance . or perhaps ohm activity depends on small - scale conditions that are decoupled from global properties of mergers .",
    "the provenance of ohm emission vis -  - vis the host galaxy has been extensively investigated in the radio through x - ray bands by comparing samples of ohm galaxies to similarly selected non - masing control samples . for example , @xcite and @xcite studied radio and ir properties vis -  - vis the agn versus starburst contributions to ohm activity , @xcite and @xcite investigated the ohm fraction in ( u)lirgs versus star formation rate and ir color , @xcite and @xcite used optical spectral classification to distinguish populations and to quantify agn fraction in ohm hosts , and @xcite conducted an x - ray study of the contribution of agns to ohm hosts . while some of these studies pointed to minor differences in statistical samples of ohm hosts versus nonmasing systems , they could not identify on a case - by - case basis which systems would harbor ohms and which would not based on any observable quantity except the oh line itself .",
    "theoretical modeling of ohm formation has seen a recent renaissance : @xcite model the @xmath8  pc molecular torus in iii  zw  35 and show how ohm emission is a stochastic amplification of unsaturated emission by multiple overlapping clouds , and @xcite show how the general excitation of ohms is fundamentally different from galactic oh maser emission and predict that a single excitation temperature governs all 18  cm oh lines . while the physics of ohms is crystallizing , and models predict that beaming is not likely to be the dominant factor in the ohm fraction among ( u)lirgs , it remains unclear on a case - by - case basis what conditions found in starbursts drive or prohibit ohm formation .    here",
    "we describe a dense gas trigger for ohm formation , at last identifying physical observable properties that differentiate ohms from nonmasing mergers .",
    "we identify ohms , oh absorbers , oh kilomasers , and oh non - detections in the gao & solomon ( 2004a ; hereafter gs04a ) sample (  [ sec : sample ] ) and employ co(@xmath9 ) and hcn(@xmath9 ) molecular gas tracers to show that while oh absorbers appear nearly uniformly distributed in @xmath10 and @xmath5 , ohms represent the _ majority _ of the nonlinear population in the ir - co relation (  [ sec : results ] ) . in combination with a kennicutt - schmidt - based star formation model of co line emission by @xcite",
    ", we identify a high mean molecular density driving ohm emission , and from the hcn / co ratio we find that ohm galaxies are exclusively high dense gas fraction starbursts (  [ sec : results ] ) . now that we can at last observe quantities that are highly predictive of ohm activity",
    ", we can employ ohms at high redshifts as probes of major galaxy mergers and extreme star formation (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the somewhat diverse gs04a hcn sample that forms the basis for this study includes most ir- and co - bright galaxies ( by flux ) and most local northern ulirgs ( @xmath11  km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "table [ tab : hcnsample ] lists basic properties and line luminosities of all galaxies in the sample that have been observed in the 1667  mhz oh line by various groups .",
    "the hcn sample includes 8 ohms , 12 oh absorption systems , 4 oh kilomasers , and 40 oh nondetections .",
    "while the division between oh kilomasers and ohms at @xmath13 is rather arbitrary , the @xmath14 values for the oh kilomasers are well separated from the ohms in table [ tab : hcnsample ] by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "three of the four oh kilomasers in this sample show both emission and absorption .",
    "oh types marked with an asterisk are somewhat uncertain and have been omitted from all subsequent analysis and figures .",
    "we have included in figure [ fig : ir_vs_co ] four additional ohms that have been detected in co by @xcite but have not yet been observed in hcn : iras  03521 + 0028 ,",
    "14070 + 0525 , 16090@xmath150139 , and 18368 + 3549 .",
    "sorting the gs04a sample by oh type  megamaser , kilomaser , absorber , or non - detection  reveals striking properties of ohm host galaxies that set them apart from other starburst galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : ir_vs_co ] shows that ohms comprise the majority of the population that is offset from the linear @xmath10-@xmath16 relation .",
    "oh absorbers and kilomasers , however , generally follow the linear ir - co relation . using the relationship between @xmath17 and the mean h@xmath18 density , @xmath19 , derived from kennicutt - schmidt laws by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.2 ) , we show in figure [ fig : ir_vs_co ] that all ohms in the sample are produced in starburst volumes of @xmath20@xmath21  pc@xmath22 ( radii @xmath23130290  pc ) and that all but one ohm have extremely high volume - averaged molecular densities , @xmath24@xmath1  @xmath2 . in fact ,",
    "7 of 10 objects in the hcn sample in this density range are ohms and one is a nonabsorbing oh kilomaser . note that @xmath19 is the _",
    "h@xmath18 density ; the clouds responsible for ohms within these regions must be significantly denser than the mean .",
    "there are many nonmasing systems with high @xmath10 at lower densities and larger volumes than the ohms , demonstrating that molecular density , not the ir radiation field , is the ohm trigger .",
    "equally striking is the segregation of ohms from nonmasing starbursts in a plot of @xmath10 versus @xmath25 , a proxy for dense molecular gas fraction @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : ir_vs_dense ] and [ fig : hists ] show that all 8 ohms ( and the nonabsorbing oh kilomaser ) have @xmath26 .",
    "there are also 2 oh absorbers and 5 oh nondetections this regime , so ohms comprise roughly half of this unusual population .",
    "there are no ohms with @xmath27 , but there are many other luminous systems , including oh absorption systems and oh absorbers with coincident kilomaser emission .",
    "galaxies with oh absorption are fairly uniformly distributed in @xmath10 and dense gas fraction , indicating that oh abundance is not a factor in ohm formation .",
    "the @xmath28 fraction of ohms in dense starbursts constrains ohm beaming be a minor contributor to the ohm fraction in lirgs , and we conclude that the ohm emission solid angle must be greater than @xmath6 steradians .",
    "a dense gas trigger for ohm formation is consistent with the modeling work by @xcite showing that the critical component for ohm formation is cloud - cloud overlap ; a starburst - scale high mean molecular density and high dense gas fraction both provide the required overlap of many dense clouds . what is not yet clear is whether ohm activity is a density effect or simply a concentration effect .",
    "the rough size scales bracketing all ohms in figure [ fig : ir_vs_co ] are also consistent with the 100200  pc ohm emission regions observed with vlbi ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is somewhat surprising that significant differences between ohm hosts and nonmasing systems are seen at all in unresolved observations because masing nuclei are `` contaminated '' by nonmasing nuclei within mergers .",
    "we expect that the observed differences between ohms and nonmasing starbursts would intensify in resolved observations . however , high dipole moment molecules such as hcn and cs may be good ohm location - selective tracers that obviate the need to obtain subarcsecond resolution .    it is certain that the ohm phase is transitory because star formation rates found in these systems are sustainable for @xmath20@xmath21  yr , whereas the complete merging process requires of order @xmath29  yr . what is not known , however , is whether this mode of star formation is a universal , inevitable stage or an uncommon event in major galaxy mergers .",
    "tidal torques spike multiple times during mergers , and many major mergers are likely to experience a ulirg phase , but will most mergers experience the even more extreme ohm phase ?",
    "the simple observation that about @xmath30 of lirgs with @xmath31 show ohm activity @xcite suggests that if _ all _ lirgs experience an ohm stage , then the ohm lifetime is of order @xmath30 of the lirg lifetime .",
    "if only a subset of lirgs have an ohm stage , then the ohm lifetime must be longer .",
    "it is also possible that ohms draw from a larger `` pool '' of galaxies that begin at lower @xmath32 than the lirg sample , which would allow a shorter ohm lifetime .",
    "constraints on the ohm lifetime are clearly critical to understanding ohms and the modes of star formation in major galaxy mergers .",
    "we have identified three closely related physical properties that differentiate ohms from other starburst galaxies : ohm hosts have the highest mean molecular gas densities , they are a distinct population in the nonlinear part of the ir - co relation , and they reside in galaxies with exceptionally high dense molecular gas fractions .",
    "we conclude that molecular gas must be concentrated and massive in order to reach the mean density required to form an ohm in a galactic nucleus .",
    "ir luminosity is not a condition for ohm formation ; both star formation and ohm activity are consequences of the tidal density enhancements accompanying galaxy interactions .",
    "the fraction of ohms in dense starbursts constrains ohm beaming to be a minor effect : ohm solid angle emission must be greater than @xmath6 steradians .",
    "these conclusions are in good agreement with the stochastic cloud - cloud overlap amplification model by @xcite .",
    "the rather uniform distribution of oh absorbers in ir , hcn , and co luminosity suggests that oh abundance is not a significant factor in ohm formation .",
    "the main caveat to these conclusions is that the sample of ohms with hcn observations remains small , and should be expanded , particularly to higher redshifts to include `` typical '' ohms .",
    "ohms are signposts of the most intense , compact , and unusual modes of star formation in the local universe , and surveys for ohms will now provide detailed information about the detected host galaxies and their mode of star formation .",
    "the missing datum required for a complete interpretation of ohm surveys , however , is the ohm lifetime .",
    "this work benefited significantly from comments by the anonymous referee .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with nasa .",
