    "jet suppression  @xcite measurements in experiments involving ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions - and their subsequent comparison with theoretical predictions - provide an excellent tool for studying the properties of a qcd medium created in these collisions  @xcite .",
    "the suppression results from the energy loss of high energy partons moving through the plasma  @xcite ; consequently , reliable computations of jet energy loss are essential for the reliable predictions of jet suppression . while several theories of jet energy loss provide a reasonable agreement with specific measured data  @xcite , there is a question to what extent theoretical predictions can explain fine resolution between different observables .",
    "an interesting example of such fine resolution is provided by recently available alice preliminary measurements  @xcite for charged pions and kaons in central 2.76 tev pb+pb collisions at lhc .",
    "these data show that @xmath1 suppression is systematically ( across the entire momentum range ) somewhat larger than @xmath0 suppression .",
    "consequently , these data provide an interesting example of fine qualitative differences between observables , and also an opportunity to test if theory can resolve such fine hierarchy . to answer this question",
    ", we here use our theoretical formalism for jet suppression in finite size dynamical qcd medium  @xcite to test whether , and under what conditions , this formalism is able to explain such measurements .",
    "the quenched hadron spectra @xmath3 is calculated from the initial spectra @xmath4 by using the generic pqcd convolution @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes light quarks and gluons ( we neglect heavy quarks since their contribution to pions and kaons is negligible ) . in the equation above @xmath7",
    "denotes the energy loss probability , while @xmath8 represents the fragmentation function of quarks or gluons @xmath6 to hadron @xmath9 .",
    "the energy loss probability @xmath10 is generalized to include both radiative and collisional energy loss in a realistic finite size dynamical qcd medium . in the calculation of the energy loss probability",
    ", we also included multi - gluon  @xcite and path - length fluctuations  @xcite . in the path length fluctuations , the length distributions for 0 - 5% most central collisions",
    "are introduced according to  @xcite .",
    "note that the path length distribution is a geometric quantity , which is the same for all jet varieties .",
    "furthermore , we include the procedure for gluon number fluctuations in the radiative energy loss probability as described in detail in ref .",
    "we recently improved the dynamical energy loss formalism in the finite size qcd medium  @xcite to include finite magnetic mass effects  @xcite and running coupling  @xcite .",
    "specifically , eq . ( 10 ) in  @xcite represents the gluon radiation spectrum used in our calculations , while running coupling is introduced according to eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) from  @xcite .",
    "the full fluctuation spectrum for collisional energy loss is taken to be gaussian , whose mean is equal to the average collisional energy loss , and the width is determined by @xmath11  @xcite . note that the average collisional energy loss @xmath12 is determined by eq .",
    "( 14 ) in  @xcite , @xmath13 denotes the temperature of the medium , @xmath14 is the initial jet momentum , while @xmath15 is the jet path length .",
    "finally , note that in the suppression calculations we first calculate how the quark and gluon spectrums are modified by the radiative energy loss , and subsequently calculate how this spectrum changes due to collisional energy loss .",
    "that is , we separately treat radiative and collisional energy losses in the suppression calculations .",
    "such approximation is reasonable when the radiative and collisional energy losses are sufficiently small ( which is in the essence of the soft - gluon , soft - rescattering approximation , assumed in all available energy loss calculations ) , and when radiative and collisional energy losses can be decoupled ( as is the case in the htl approach  @xcite that is used in our energy loss calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume a large enough quenched energy @xmath16 , so that we can apply the eikonal approximation .",
    "finally , we assume that the jet to hadron fragmentation functions are the same in pb+pb and @xmath17 collisions , which is a reasonable approximation for the deconfined qcd medium , i.e. when hadronization occurs after the parton leaves the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "we consider a qgp of temperature @xmath18mev ( as extracted by alice  @xcite ) , with @xmath19 effective light quark flavors ; we take perturbative qcd scale to be @xmath20  gev .",
    "mass of the light quarks is assumed to be dominated by the thermal mass @xmath21 , while the gluon mass is @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "here debye mass @xmath23  gev is obtained by self - consistently solving the eq .",
    "( 3 ) from  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , and magnetic mass @xmath24 is taken as @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "initial distributions for gluons and light quarks are computed at next - to - leading order as in  @xcite , and path - length fluctuations are taken from  @xcite . since fragmentation functions can affect hierarchy of the suppression predictions for different particle species  @xcite , we will here in parallel use two choices , i.e. the widely used kkp  @xcite and a more recent dss  @xcite fragmentation functions .    since the goal of this paper is to test our ability to explain the fine resolution between the pion and kaon suppression data , we start by individually comparing these data with our predictions .",
    "figure  [ pionkaonraa ] shows comparison of the theoretical predictions with preliminary @xmath0 and @xmath1 data for kkp and dss fragmentation functions . for pions",
    ", we see a very good agreement between our predictions and experimental data , irrespectively of the choice of the fragmentation functions . for kaons ,",
    "we again notice a good agreement with measurements .",
    "however , one can also notice a better agreement for dss compared to kkp fragmentation functions , i.e. kkp functions lead to consistently lower kaon suppression predictions compared to the data .",
    "consequently , there is a question whether differences in the fragmentation functions can affect explanation of the observed fine hierarchy of the data .",
    "this issue is further investigated in figure  [ kpsupp ] , where in the left panel we show the experimentally observed hierarchy in @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "the central and the right panel in the fig .",
    "[ kpsupp ] show , respectively , predictions for this hierarchy by using kkp and dss fragmentation functions . note that , for clearer comparison , we fix magnetic to electric mass ratio to @xmath26 . the left panel ( experimental measurements )",
    "shows that @xmath1 @xmath2 data points are consistently bellow the corresponding @xmath0 @xmath2 data .",
    "however , theoretical calculations using kkp fragmentation functions show a reversed hierarchy , i.e. it is obtained that the predicted @xmath1 @xmath2 is consistently above the corresponding @xmath0 @xmath2 . on the other hand , dss fragmentation functions clearly reproduce the correct ( experimentally observed ) hierarchy both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "we will bellow investigate the reasons for such qualitative difference in predictions when different fragmentation functions are used .",
    "we start by noting that the gluon suppression is significantly larger compared to the light quark suppression , which is a consequence of a much larger energy loss for gluon jets compared to light quark jets .",
    "this difference in the suppressions rises a question of what is relative gluon to light quark contribution in pion and kaon distributions , when these two types of fragmentation functions are used .",
    "this ratio is shown in figure  [ glratio ] , where in the left panel , we see that kkp fragmentation functions predict a larger gluon to light quark ratio for pions compared to kaons .",
    "this ratio evidently leads to the larger suppression of pions compared to kaons , having in mind the larger suppression in gluons compared to light quarks .",
    "on the other hand , dss fragmentation functions lead to a larger gluon contribution in kaons compared to pions , which evidently leads to larger suppression of kaons compared to pions , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ kpsupp ] - this time in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "consequently , we see that the difference in the gluon to light quark contribution in the fragmentation functions leads to qualitative differences in the predicted suppression hierarchy .",
    "comparison of jet suppression predictions with the available experimental data , is considered an excellent tool to test our understanding of qcd matter created in ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we here concentrated on recently available @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 data in central pb+pb collisions at lhc , where we observed an interesting fine hierarchy between the measured suppression patterns .",
    "such fine resolution allows more precisely testing to what extent , and under what numerical / computational conditions , these experimental results can be theoretically explained .",
    "we particularly concentrated on the role of fragmentation functions in this study , since they have potential to affect hierarchy of the suppression predictions for different particle species .",
    "we found that our predictions lead to an excellent agreement with the measured data for dss fragmentation functions , and somewhat worse - but still reasonable - agreement for kkp fragmentation functions .",
    "however , we also found that qualitatively reproducing the experimentally observed fine hierarchy critically depends of the choice of the fragmentation functions .",
    "this not only underscores an importance on proper choice of fragmentation functions , but also argues about usefulness of comparing the theoretical predictions with suppression data even at the fine resolution exemplified here .    _",
