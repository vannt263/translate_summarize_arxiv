    "understanding the formation , evolution , and ultimate fate of massive stars is a key open question in astrophysics . a particularly interesting problem concerns the formation of highly stripped objects known as wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars .",
    "it is still unclear whether w - r stars are formed through wind driven mass loss from single very massive stars , or if binary interactions play an important role in which case the minimal initial mass of w - r stars may be much lower .",
    "the final stages in the evolution of a massive star influence the type of explosion it will undergo at the end of its life ; studying the resulting core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) is thus an attractive way to learn about these massive progenitors .",
    "the hope is to reveal how the physical properties of the star ( such as its mass and metallicity ) determine its pre - explosion mass loss , as reflected in the properties of the ensuing sn .",
    "an additional benefit is that luminous sn explosions are visible to great distances and hence provide access to a wide range of stellar populations , while normal individual stars can be effectively studied only within the local group .",
    "core - collapse sn explosions of massive stars are observationally classified according to their spectroscopic properties ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) .",
    "h - rich type iip ( `` plateau '' ) sne have been associated with red supergiant progenitors ( smartt 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "the progenitors of type iib sne appear to have lost most ( but not all ) of their hydrogen envelope before they exploded .",
    "further mass loss leads to type ib explosions showing strong he lines but lacking h , while sne  ic , lacking both h and he , probably arise from the most highly stripped progenitors .",
    "a particular subclass of sne  ic , displaying very broad lines ( sne  ic - bl ) indicating high expansion velocities , is notable for the fact that its members are the only events to have been observationally linked with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; see woosley & bloom 2006 for a review ) . while it stands to reason that h - poor sne arise from h - poor w - r stars , attempts to directly detect such stars in pre - explosion images of the locations of sne  ib and ic have so far failed ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2005 ; maund et al .",
    "2005 ; crockett et al .",
    "2008b ; smartt 2009 ) . the exact identity of the progenitor stars of sne  iib / ib / ic , as well as those of grbs and xrfs , remains an unsolved puzzle .",
    "given the limited efficacy of direct pre - explosion imaging studies , one can attempt to study massive - star populations using statistical analyses of the resulting sne .",
    "two main methods have been employed for this purpose thus far , as follows .    the number ratio of sne  ib / c to sne  ii as a function of host - galaxy metallicity has been measured using host luminosity as a metallicity proxy for 280 and 497 core - collapse sne ( prantzos & boissier 2003 ; boissier & prantzos 2009 , respectively ) , as well as via direct metallicity measurements for 159 core - collapse sne ( prieto et al . 2008 ) .",
    "both methods show that the ratio of sne  ib / c to sne  ii increases with increasing host metallicity .",
    "this suggests that wind - driven mass loss plays an important role in the formation of stripped w - r stars exploding as sne  ib / c , and that at lower metallicities massive stars that would have ended as sne  ib / c explode instead as type ii events ( `` failed ib / c '' ) .",
    "heger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) predicted this behavior , but their decline rate for the sn  ib / c ratio with decreasing metallicity , as well as that of fryer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , does not agree with the boissier & prantzos ( 2009 ) data .",
    "the location of a sn in its host galaxy can also be indicative of the mass and metallicity of its progenitor .",
    "anderson & james ( 2009 ) examined 173 core - collapse sn locations and confirmed previous results by van den bergh ( 1997 ) , tsvetkov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and hakobyan ( 2008 ) which indicated that sne  ib / c are preferentially found in more central regions of their host galaxies compared to sne  ii ( see also boissier & prantzos 2009 ; hakobyan 2009 ) , with sne  ic the most centrally concentrated .",
    "this implies a progenitor - metallicity sequence ( ii - ib - ic ) with sne  ic having the highest metallicity progenitors . like the population - ratio studies",
    ", these results also suggest that sn  ib / c progenitor analogs ( in terms of mass ) would explode as sne  ii in low - metallicity regions .",
    "other location studies , however , indicate otherwise .",
    "fruchter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that long - duration grbs occur preferentially in faint ( metal - poor ) galaxies ( see also stanek et al .",
    "2006 ) and in brighter regions than the general core - collapse population ( based on 16 core - collapse sn locations ) .",
    "kelly et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that sne  ic ( 26 in their sample ) occur in areas within their hosts similar to those of long - duration grbs .",
    "taken together , these results , as well as those of leloudas et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , would suggest that some sn  ic progenitor analogs in low - metallicity environments tend to explode as sne  ic - bl ( accompanied by long grbs ) rather than as sne  ii .    while the results from the studies described above are intriguing and hint at the power of the statistical analysis of large sn samples , a clear picture has yet to emerge .",
    "perhaps this is due to the small number of events in dwarf , low - metallicity galaxies ( leading prantzos & boissier 2003 and boissier & prantzos 2009 , for example , to extend the `` dwarf '' galaxy bin to luminosities as bright as @xmath7 mag ) .",
    "it should also be noted that many studies to date were based on heterogeneous compilations of sn data , inheriting their strong and unknown selection effects , and many included sne discovered decades ago , the exact classification of which was unclear ( anderson & james 2009 ) . here",
    "we present a population - ratio analysis for the first sample of 72 core - collapse sne from the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; rau et al .",
    "2009 ; law et al . 2009 ) , 15 of which are in dwarf galaxies having @xmath8-band magnitudes @xmath2 .",
    "the observational data are described in @xmath9 and the results in @xmath10 .",
    "we discuss our findings in @xmath11 and summarize in @xmath12 .",
    "ptf is a wide - field variability survey aimed at a systematic study of the transient sky .",
    "the survey camera , mounted on the 48 in oschin schmidt telescope at palomar observatory ( p48 ) , delivers a 7.8 square degree field of view per image .",
    "the survey is now fully operational , having discovered thousands of transients and hundreds of sne .",
    "see rau et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for a review of ptf science and observing strategies , and law et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for performance and technical information concerning ptf .",
    "one of the key objectives of ptf involves the construction of a large sample of core - collapse events , for which multicolor optical light curves and spectra are collected through dedicated follow - up resources .",
    "such data will allow for a systematic study of the core - collapse sn population , the first results of which are presented here .",
    "our sn sample is comprised of 72 nearby ( redshift @xmath130.184 , with mean @xmath14 and median @xmath15 ; fig .",
    "[ figz ] ) core - collapse sne discovered by ptf ( table [ sntable ] ; discussed in detail by gal - yam et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) from march 2009 through march 2010 .",
    "ptf provides an untargeted ( i.e. , random across the sky , unlike previous sn surveys which focused on known , generally large galaxies ) , homogeneous sample of core - collapse events . the high - cadence ptf monitoring and its sensitivity largely reduce effects of light - curve shape and type - specific peak absolute magnitudes in biasing against a certain variety of sn .",
    "while the ptf detection efficiencies have not yet been fully quantified , any type - specific biases should not depend on host - galaxy luminosity , and are therefore unlikely to impact our analysis .",
    "the sample analyzed here includes only events spectroscopically confirmed as core - collapse sne .        while smaller than the datasets used in previous studies , the nature of the ptf survey provides a minimally biased homogeneous sample . to our knowledge it is the largest collection of core - collapse events ever assembled from a single untargeted survey , rich ( @xmath1 ) in sne from dwarf ( @xmath2 mag ) hosts .",
    "furthermore , detailed subtype classification has been carried out for all of the sne in our sample .",

    "furthermore , in ptf the difficulty arises only in the central @xmath33 of the galaxies ( which have much larger typical sizes ) , so we expect this effect to be negligible ( indeed , most nuclear ptf events are active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "\\(3 ) in some cases , sne can be confused with other transients .",
    "for this reason , the spectra of all sn candidates were checked by eye as well as using superfit ( howell et al .",
    "2005 ) and snid ( blondin et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we retained those candidates which are most likely sne .",
    "\\(4 ) some sne may have undergone evolution from one subclass to another ( for example , from type ii to type iib ) , which could have escaped our notice due to limited spectroscopic coverage .",
    "a detailed discussion of this issue will be given in a companion paper ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) ; however this uncertainty exists for sne regardless of host luminosity , and is thus not expected to bias our results systematically .",
    "\\(5 ) our derived metallicity values are influenced by the chosen method and adopted parameters . in addition , some nearby grb hosts have been found to lie below the luminosity vs. metallicity relation ( i.e. , have lower metallicities than their luminosities suggest ; kewley et al . 2007 ) ; moreover , while many sne  ic - bl hosts do lie along the luminosity vs. metallicity relation , some outliers have been observed ( modjaz et al . 2008 ) .",
    "using direct host - galaxy measurements could thus be more insightful .",
    "however , because we do not state any metallicity - specific conclusions in this work , we leave a more detailed treatment of this issue to a future paper .",
    "\\(6 ) metallicity varies within galaxies , while here we deal with global metallicity and luminosity values .",
    "indeed , a location study of our sn sample would complement these results .",

    "2007 ) predict a fraction of @xmath37 in dwarf hosts . distinguishing between sn  ib / c to sn  ii ratios of 0.25 and 0.1 at the 95% confidence level",
    "requires a dwarf - host sn sample size of @xmath38 ( assuming binomial statistics ) , which is expected to be attained by ptf within the next few years .",
    "the data to be gathered by ptf ( as well as other surveys ) will thus allow strong conclusions to be drawn in the near future .",
    "our distinction among sne  ib , ic , and ic - bl subtypes , as well as separating types ii and iib , demonstrates the power of a detailed spectroscopic classification .",

    "`` normal '' sne  ic , abundant in large galaxies , are not present , or are rare , in dwarf hosts .",

    "2007 ) may include one normal sn  ic hosted by a galaxy meeting our definition of a dwarf ( sn 2004gk ; quimby et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the sample otherwise shows trends similar to the ptf results .",
    "we further identify an overabundance of sne  iib and sne  ic - bl in dwarf galaxies . assuming the fraction @xmath39 of sne  iib is independent of host luminosity",

    "this probability as a function of @xmath39 is given by @xmath42 varying @xmath39 between 0 and 1 , we find that this probability is @xmath43 .",
    "a similar result is found for the overabundance of sne  ic - bl in dwarf hosts .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the observed trends are produced by chance from the same underlying population .",
    "our data suggest that `` normal '' sne  ic occurring in giant galaxies are replaced by iib and ic - bl events in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this seems to confirm both trends suggested by previous location and population - ratio studies , implying two distinct mechanisms at work .",
    "metallicity might be the main process responsible for the evolution of stars which explode as `` normal '' sne  ic . in lower metallicity environments , stars that would otherwise explode as sne  ic end their lives as ib or iib events , while many sn  ib progenitors are also driven toward type iib explosions following a decrease in their mass loss",
    ". however , an additional process which allows for strong stripping in low - metallicity environments must be present to explain the sne  ic - bl and long grb events observed in dwarf hosts .",
    "binarity and rapid stellar rotation are possible candidates for such a stripping mechanism .",
    "finally , we note an apparent excess of stripped ( iib+ib+ic+ic - bl ) sne in dwarf galaxies , compared to `` normal '' sne  ii ( see figures [ fighostmag ] and [ figpie ] ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it is unlikely to be caused by mass - loss mechanisms , which are expected to be stronger in high - metallicity environments .",
    "a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) in dwarf galaxies might be required to explain this effect ( see also hakobyan et al .",
    "2009 ; habergham et al .",
    "such an imf is also consistent with pair - production sne ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2009 ) and highly luminous sne ( quimby et al . 2009 ) , which are associated with very massive progenitors , occurring only in dwarf hosts .",
    "our analysis is limited by small - number statistics . continued observations by ptf",
    "are expected to rapidly increase the sample size during the coming few years .",
    "an attractive complementary study is to analyze the locations of our sne within their host galaxies ( e.g. , as done by fruchter et al .",
    "2006 and kelly et al .",
    "2008 on similar - sized samples ) .",
    "a combined analysis should provide a powerful constraint on the evolution and mass - loss properties of massive stars as a function of their metallicity .",
    "the distance and angular size of our host sample require the high spatial resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ to carry out this test .",
    "we have analyzed the initial compilation of core - collapse sne discovered by the ptf during its first post - commissioning year , which comprises the largest homogeneous collection of core - collapse events from a single untargeted survey ever assembled .",
    "our data indicate an absence of `` normal '' sne  ic in dwarf galaxies offset by an excess of sne  iib and sne  ic - bl .",
    "we deduce that a metallicity - dependent process might be responsible for turning `` failed sne  ic '' into sne  ib and iib , while a second process forms the progenitors of sne  ic - bl and , by association , perhaps also of long - duration grbs in dwarf galaxies .",
    "our sample of sne should increase substantially in the coming years .",
    "ultimately , we plan to analyze the distribution of the different types of sne as a function of host - galaxy luminosity , without having to impose an artificial dwarf / giant cut .",
    "in addition , high - resolution imaging of host galaxies will enable location studies to be conducted on this sn sample , including ( for the first time ) a large fraction of dwarf hosts .",
    "such analyses will continue to expand the use of sne in dwarf galaxies as a powerful tool in the study of massive stars .",
