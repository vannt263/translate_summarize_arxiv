    "a complete microscopic representation of a macroscopic system is usually unavailable and often unnecessary , especially if the system is evolving or it is taken from an ensemble and the goal is to understand the typical features of the ensemble .",
    "thus instead of determining a huge number of parameters ( such as the @xmath7 coordinates and momenta of atoms ) , it often suffices to know a few useful macroscopic quantities ( like the total number of atoms and the total energy ) to understand the bulk properties of a macroscopic system .    in the realm of networks ,",

    "the best - known case is strictly linear preferential attachment  @xcite , in which a new node attaches to a pre - existing node of degree @xmath1 with rate @xmath17 . to illustrate the quantities studied here , we plot the degree distribution for a realization of such a network of @xmath18 nodes ( fig .",

    "it is also worth noting that the number of distinct degrees in a particular realization of a network is reminiscent of the `` graphicality '' of a network .",
