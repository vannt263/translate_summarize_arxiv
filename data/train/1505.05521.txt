    "the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ) survey @xcite has thus far obtained medium - resolution ( @xmath3 ) spectra for over 3  million stars , on its way to a goal of acquiring some 6 - 8  million stellar spectra over a planned 5-year survey .",
    "such a vast survey provides an invaluable resource for studies of milky way stellar dynamics .",
    "lamost data have been used to explore kinematical asymmetries in the nearby disk @xcite , nearby stellar moving groups ( @xcite ) , high - velocity @xcite and hyper - velocity stars @xcite , and stellar kinematics in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "more distant halo structure is also accessible via red giant branch ( rgb ) stars observed by lamost .",
    "however , rgb stars can be difficult to identify among the much more numerous foreground dwarfs .",
    "@xcite developed a method to select k - type giants from their lamost spectra , and a technique to identify m giants ( which are not processed in the main lamost stellar parameters pipeline ) has been developed by @xcite ; see also the study of the sagittarius tidal stream m giants by li et al .",
    ", _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "all of these studies require an estimate of the distances to the stars involved in order to place them within the structure of the galaxy . to use the lamost data to understand the dynamics of the milky way , it is thus vitally important to devise a method for determining stellar distances .",
    "one of the main outputs of a survey such as lamost is the spectroscopically derived line of sight ( radial ) velocity ( rv ) for each star . in order to exploit this velocity information as a probe of galactic dynamics",
    ", one must know the three - dimensional position of each star within the galaxy .",
    "the position on the sky is , of course , well known , but estimating the third dimension of each star s position ( its distance ) is non - trivial .",
    "furthermore , even if reliable proper motions are known for each star , combining these with the rvs to derive a three - dimensional space motion for each star requires knowing its distance .",
    "a survey such as lamost inevitably contains numerous nearby ( mostly disk ) dwarfs , with a smaller fraction of intrinsically bright rgb stars ( e.g. , k giants ; see @xcite ) that can be used to study more distant structures in the halo of the milky way .",
    "thus , in order to fully exploit lamost data for studies of galactic structure , we require not only reliable estimates of stellar parameters , but a robust estimate of the distance to each star , based on available photometry and information gleaned from its spectrum .    for each star whose spectrum has sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , the lamost pipeline ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) derives effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath5 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) . when these stellar parameters are known for a single star , it is typical to compare the measured parameters to theoretical isochrones , and use the best theoretical match to estimate the absolute magnitude of the star in question .",
    "this is fairly straightforward for a single star , but to robustly determine distances by this technique for large numbers of stars in an automated way presents a challenge .",
    "recently , a variety of techniques have been presented for deriving distances to large numbers of stars with stellar parameters resulting from spectroscopic surveys such as radial velocity experiment ( rave ; @xcite ) , sdss / segue ( @xcite ) , and sdss / apogee .",
    "these include a @xmath6 minimization routine that compares rave stellar parameters to a grid of isochrones @xcite , and a modification of this technique @xcite to account for the stellar luminosity function of the isochrones .",
    "bayesian methods that include models of galactic stellar populations as priors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have also been applied to rave data .",
    "distances presented by the segue stellar parameters pipeline ( sspp ; @xcite ) are based on empirical fits from @xcite to globular cluster fiducial sequences , and require separate calibrations for stars in different evolutionary stages .",
    "an alternate method that has been applied to segue halo k - giants uses a bayesian approach to account for the luminosity function and metallicity distribution @xcite .",
    "distances for stars observed by apogee have thus far been limited to well - characterized stars such as red - clump stars @xcite and red giants in the kepler field that have asteroseismic surface gravities @xcite .",
    "our method of deriving distances from lamost spectroscopic parameters was chosen to avoid introducing assumptions about stellar populations and their distribution in the galaxy .",
    "we simply want the best empirical estimate of the distance , so that we can _ use _ this to explore the distribution of stellar populations in the milky way .",
    "the distribution of observed stellar parameters will be biased by the method used to select targets ( e.g. , the color and magnitude selection criteria ) , the intrinsic properties ( including the stellar parameters and luminosity function ) of the galactic sub - populations sampled in each observed region , and perhaps even the observing conditions under which each spectrum was obtained .",
    "one benefit of lamost is that each star is observed as part of a `` plate '' on which @xmath7 stars are simultaneously targeted .",
    "each plate covers a narrow magnitude range and has a simple target selection function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , making it possible for us to use the observations themselves to account for both the selection function and the stellar luminosity function in our distance estimates . in practice",
    ", the selection function has not remained the same throughout the lamost survey , making it impossible to back out the probability of observing a star with given properties explicitly .",
    "we account for the effects of target selection by using the empirically measured distribution of stellar parameters on each plate as a prior for the likelihood of finding a star of a given surface gravity at a given color and magnitude . in this way",
    ", we are explicitly including the observed @xmath5 for all stars on a plate to derive an estimate of our expectations along each line of sight , thus removing selection biases and the effects of differently sampled milky way populations along each line of sight .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : dist_method ] discusses the techniques we have developed for deriving distances to stars with lamost stellar parameters . in section  [ sec : verification ] we verify the effectiveness of our technique using several catalogs from the literature , as well as simulated data sets .",
    "we follow with a brief illustration of the results from applying our algorithms to the entire lamost data set of @xmath8  million stellar spectra in section  [ sec : lamost_dist ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with some remarks about the utility of this method for galactic structure science with lamost .",
    "we derive distances to stars by comparing measured stellar parameters to a grid of synthetic isochrones . initially , a simple @xmath6 method is tested . though the results from this algorithm seem reasonable , it is difficult to derive reasonable uncertainties .",
    "we thus turn to a bayesian technique , which also has the advantage of allowing the priors to be easily adjusted in the future as desired .",
    "we began by creating a grid of isochrones from the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite .",
    "this particular set of isochrones was chosen in part because it more accurately reproduces the lower main sequence in sdss colors than other systems @xcite , and in part simply for the convenience with which one can generate a custom grid of isochrones in the dartmouth system .",
    "we tested our programs with padova isochrones @xcite , and found that the differences in derived distances are less than a few percent , with most of the discrepancies at the cooler end of the main sequence .",
    "our adopted grid contains isochrones ranging from @xmath9 [ fe / h ] @xmath10 in 0.1  dex increments , and 1 - 15 gyr in linearly spaced 1  gyr increments .",
    "all isochrones were generated with @xmath11/fe ] = 0.0 .",
    "isochrone grids were generated for the sdss @xmath12 and the @xmath13 photometric bands , in order to allow for the use of a variety of input magnitudes to derive distances .",
    "we removed low - mass stars ( @xmath14 ) and all evolutionary stages other than main sequence , subgiant , and rgb .",
    "other evolutionary stages ( e.g. , horizontal branch ) are not well classified at present by lamost spectra , and are also not well represented in the isochrones , so we chose to excise them and keep only `` normal , '' well - behaved stars .    before using the grid of isochrones for derivation of distances ,",
    "it was interpolated onto a regularly spaced distribution in absolute magnitude .",
    "because we need an absolute magnitude that corresponds to each metallicity , age , surface gravity , and temperature in the grid , we begin by creating a dummy array of absolute magnitudes spanning the relevant range ( @xmath15 for 2mass colors / magnitudes , and @xmath16 for sdss ) , in increments of 0.02 magnitudes . for each combination of the 15 age steps and 31 steps in [ fe / h ] making up our grid",
    ", we then use a cubic spline interpolation to map the effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath5 ) behavior as a function of absolute magnitude . in this way",
    ", we create a grid with identical values of absolute magnitude for each age / metallicity combination , which then simply reflects the @xmath4 and @xmath5 of a theoretical star at that age / metallicity that would have each value of absolute magnitude in the array . in other words , at each absolute magnitude , we create arrays with all combinations of age , [ fe / h ] , temperature , and surface gravity that are predicted by the isochrone grid .",
    "the goal is to take the measured stellar parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and [ fe / h ] , along with known photometric magnitudes and colors , and derive a distance to each star .",
    "we employ near - infrared 2mass @xcite magnitudes and colors from here onward , but these can be replaced with magnitudes from any other system ( e.g. , sdss ) for which the dartmouth isochrones have been calculated .",
    "we chose 2mass because @xmath17 of the objects in the lamost catalog have matches in 2mass , thus providing a uniform input catalog ( note that the majority of the objects that do not have 2mass counterparts are at the faintest magnitudes reached by lamost ) .",
    "the use of 2mass also simplifies comparisons to other catalogs that may not overlap the sdss footprint or magnitude range .",
    "assuming we have measured input parameters ( `` observables '' ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath18 ( or any other input color ) , and associated errors @xmath19}$ ] , and @xmath20 , we can define a @xmath6 statistic :    @xmath21    where the @xmath22 are the observables ( @xmath23 in this example ) with associated errors @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the isochrone model parameters corresponding to each observable . to determine the best value for our data , we find the model point at which @xmath6 is a minimum .",
    "the distance modulus then simply consists of the difference between the model star s absolute magnitude at this best - fit point and the input ( measured ) magnitude .    to account for errors on the observables ,",
    "while also deriving an uncertainty on our derived distance , we resample @xmath26 times ( we adopted @xmath26=100 per star after confirming that this relatively small number of samples produces nearly identical results as @xmath27 per star , while keeping computation times reasonable ) from within gaussian - distributed errors on each of the parameters , then minimize @xmath6 for each sample .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the absolute @xmath28 magnitude ( @xmath29 ) from this monte carlo process are measured for each star .",
    "we then combine these with the observed @xmath28 magnitude to derive the distance and its error . at this point ,",
    "the uncertainties on many of the distances were found to be unrealistically high ( often greater than 100% for stars from lamost ) ; this is likely because the errors on the stellar parameters quoted in the lamost catalog are overestimated ( as found by @xcite via comparison to sdss spectra of stars in common between the surveys ) .",
    "although the grid spacing of 0.1  dex in [ fe / h ] is half the smallest metallicity uncertainty we have considered ( @xmath30 } = 0.2 $ ] ) , it may also be that finer grid spacing ( in both age and metallicity ) would reduce the scatter in monte carlo - resampled distance estimates . furthermore , though we tested resampling @xmath31 and 1000 times and found little effect on the derived distances and their errors , it is also possible that even larger samples are required to fully reproduce the correct pdf of @xmath29 for each star ; this was not explored further because of the computationally prohibitive cost of resampling 10,000 or more times per star .      in order to obtain a posterior pdf for the distance rather than a simple distance estimate with associated error bar , we adopt a bayesian method .",
    "this more readily allows for statistical studies of galactic populations that require the full pdf .",
    "we choose to keep the priors in our method extremely simple , unlike methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) that consider priors based on models of milky way stellar populations . because we intend to use the derived distances to study the kinematics and density distributions of milky way stellar populations and their metallicity distribution functions",
    ", we wish to avoid priors that assume any uncertain properties of these populations .",
    "it is simple to incorporate more complex priors into our algorithm in the future , should we wish to do so .",
    "consider a vector of observed stellar parameters @xmath32 } ) \\equiv ( t , g , z)$ ] with measurement errors @xmath33 .",
    "assume that these can be mapped via stellar models onto a vector of intrinsic properties @xmath34 ( age , mass , metallicity)@xmath35 that together determine the evolution of each star . rather than @xmath36 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( the helium fraction ; calculated as @xmath38 ) are given in the header of each isochrone , with details about the initial compositions of the models given in @xcite .",
    "thus , if desired , one can use the standard definition of [ fe / h]@xmath39 , with standard solar values from @xcite of @xmath40 ( initial ) and @xmath41 at the current solar age , to find @xmath36 . ] these intrinsic properties combined with the stellar models give the absolute magnitude distribution @xmath42 .",
    "the mapping from observables @xmath43 to @xmath44 represents a convolution of the intrinsic luminosity function and the ways in which the selection function has sampled this luminosity function .",
    "we will denote the selection function as @xmath45 .",
    "stellar models relate @xmath46 to @xmath43 ; we do not include any explicit dependence of model parameters on @xmath46 because we do not know anything about the ages of observed stars in advance ( i.e. , we take a uniform prior @xmath47 ) . given",
    "a set of stellar models , observed stellar parameters , and the selection function , a pdf for absolute magnitude can be derived .",
    "the full pdf is :    @xmath48    this can be rewritten as :    @xmath49    where in the first term on the right - hand side , we have removed the dependence on @xmath45 , because once the star has been observed , the likelihood @xmath50 no longer depends on the selection function . rearranging , we obtain :    @xmath51    we assume that the measured errors @xmath33 are independent of @xmath44 .",
    "this may not strictly be true  the errors may indirectly depend on intrinsic properties of the star ( e.g. , low - metallicity stars may have larger @xmath52 , or giants near the rgb tip may have higher @xmath53 ) , which in turn affect the @xmath44 . however , this should be a minimal effect for our purposes , so we take @xmath54 to be independent of @xmath44 ( i.e. , this term becomes @xmath55 ) .",
    "we also neglect the denominator , @xmath56 , which contributes only a normalization factor .",
    "the term @xmath57 is the absolute magnitude distribution given the selection function .",
    "if there is no selection function , this term would be the luminosity function .",
    "this leaves us with a final expression for the posterior pdf of @xmath44 :    @xmath58    we take the likelihood @xmath59 to be gaussian in each of @xmath60 , and @xmath36 , i.e. ,    @xmath61}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 to indicate the inclusion of @xmath63 and @xmath36 in the product , and @xmath64 indicates the corresponding parameters for the model isochrone grid ( and thus implicitly @xmath44 ) . in practice",
    ", this is accomplished by calculating this gaussian residual for the input star relative to every point in the model isochrone grid . because every point on the grid with its parameters @xmath64 has an associated @xmath44 , the likelihood given by this product of gaussians can be mapped to a likelihood distribution in @xmath44 .",
    "the term @xmath57 in equation  [ pdf_eqn_final ] encodes the relative numbers of stars as a function of @xmath44 , given the selection function @xmath45 near each star s line of sight ; i.e. , how likely a star of a certain @xmath44 is to have made it into the sample given the catalog of observed stars .",
    "this term is necessary because the entire luminosity function is not sampled by a given region of color - magnitude space . to account for this selection effect ( which depends on color and magnitude , but more importantly on position in the sky ) , we derive an empirical correction based on the stars actually observed in a given lamost plate .",
    "to do so , we select stars from the same lamost plate that are within 0.25 magnitudes in color and magnitude ( e.g. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , or whatever color - magnitude system is being used to derive distances ) of the star of interest . for each nearby star , we generate a gaussian centered at its measured @xmath5 with width equal to its associated error , @xmath67 , and then normalize its sum to unity to create a pdf .",
    "we create a generalized histogram by summing these pdfs for all of the color - magnitude selected stars in the plate , then normalize the resulting @xmath5 distribution to yield the probability of finding a star at a given @xmath5 value in the vicinity ( in both position and color - magnitude ) of the star of interest .",
    "this @xmath5 distribution is then mapped onto each input isochrone via interpolation of the @xmath68 relation of the isochrone itself .",
    "the resulting histogram in absolute magnitude is normalized to provide the probability of finding stars of a given @xmath44 based on the measured @xmath5 distribution .",
    "we incorporate this probability distribution as @xmath57 in equation  [ pdf_eqn_final ] to properly account for the underlying luminosity function along each line of sight , and the selection effects of the survey ( which corrects for both the fraction of stars that were selected as a function of color and magnitude as well as the volume of the galaxy sampled by the selected stars ) .        in the absence of a selection function , @xmath57 could be represented by the theoretical luminosity function of the isochrones . for general usage",
    ", we include this feature in the code for instances where the parameters of nearby stars are not known . in the dartmouth isochrones , the density of points along each isochrone as given encodes equal steps in `` equivalent evolutionary phase '' @xcite . assuming that this roughly mimics the luminosity function , we calculate the normalized density of points as a function of absolute magnitude for each isochrone in histogram bins of 0.2 magnitudes , and use this as the starting estimate for @xmath69 when there are not sufficient nearby , simultaneously observed stars to use for the selection function correction . in tests of the effect of the selection function correction using 20,000 stars , we found that the fractional change in distance between measurements with / without this correction was less than 10% for 93% of the stars , and less than 20% for 97% of the stars .",
    "however , a small number of stars (  1.4% ; mostly red giants ) had their distances change by more than 30% between these two methods . as expected ,",
    "then , the correction is important for the much rarer rgb stars than for the ubiquitous nearby dwarfs in the lamost database .",
    "the algorithm to evaluate each of the three terms on the right side of equation  [ pdf_eqn_final ] produces an array of points corresponding to all of the theoretical stars in the isochrone grid .",
    "each of these points has an associated @xmath44 and a likelihood value .",
    "thus equation  [ pdf_eqn_final ] also produces an array of posterior pdfs for a large grid of absolute magnitudes .",
    "we sum the pdf for each @xmath44 value to produce a marginalized pdf in @xmath44 for the input star .",
    "this is normalized to produce the final pdf @xmath70 ; some examples are shown in figure  [ samp_likelihood ] .",
    "we take the median ( i.e. , 50th percentile ) of this pdf as the best estimate for @xmath44 , with uncertainties derived using the @xmath44 corresponding to the 15th and 85th percentile values from the cumulative pdf .",
    "we also retain the full pdfs so that they can be used instead of single estimates of distances and their errors .",
    "figure  [ compare_methods ] shows a comparison of the results from running the two versions ( @xmath6 and bayesian ) of the code on stars from a mock galaxy field generated by the besanon @xcite model . to refer to distances derived by the algorithm discussed in this paper .",
    "note that this does not mean that these distances are derived using lamost data , but rather that our lamost _ distance code _ is being applied . ]",

    "both methods recover the input distances fairly well , with an asymmetric tail to high ( overestimated ) residuals .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ compare_methods ] compares these distance measurements directly .",

    "to test the code , we need a sample of stars with known spectroscopic parameters and distances . for this",

    "the first sample is the rave-6d catalog : http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave/ , which is from @xcite .",

    ", there is no obvious correlation of the distance residuals with any of the input stellar parameters ( e.g. , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "thus the systematic offset between our distance scale and that of @xcite may be due to differences in the isochrones used in the fitting .",
    "@xcite used yale - yonsei isochrones in a grid with 40 logarithmically spaced ages between 0.01 and 15  gyr .",
    "the differences between the dartmouth and yale - yonsei isochrones , and the heavy emphasis on very young ages in the @xcite grid , seem to cause systematic shifts .",
    "reassuringly , when we applied our @xmath6 code , which defines @xmath6 in the same way as @xcite , to these data , the scatter about the mean difference is small ( but the systematic offset remains ) .",
    "the second set of rave data on which we tested the code is the catalog of @xcite .",
    "these authors improved upon the method of @xcite by using a linearly spaced grid of ages , deriving distances separately using yale - yonsei , padova , and dartmouth isochrones , and by weighting stages of stellar evolution to account for the relative numbers of stars of different masses .",
    "we ran our code on the parameters of roughly 16,000 stars ( @xmath84 giants and @xmath85 dwarfs ) from @xcite and compared directly to their dartmouth results .",
    "the comparison is shown in the right panel of figure  [ ravetest ] , with residuals calculated in the same way as for the breddels et al . sample .",
    "again , these residuals show a systematic shift such that our estimates are lower than the rave distances .",
    "the systematic difference between our result and the rave distances is smaller than for the comparison to @xcite , as expected since the grid spacing in age is similar and we are using the same isochrone sets ( dartmouth ) .",

    "this can be seen in figure  [ param_dist_err ] , which compares the errors on @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and [ fe / h ] with the error in derived distances based on those parameters .",
    "there is a slight correlation of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , but little dependence of distance errors on uncertainty in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the middle panel , showing @xmath106 vs. @xmath105 , exhibits a roughly linear correlation between the surface gravity uncertainty and the errors on the derived distances . for an uncertainty of @xmath101  dex in @xmath5 ,",
    "figure  [ param_dist_err ] suggests that we can expect a @xmath107 distance error .",
    "it is thus vital that surface gravities from lamost spectra are determined as precisely as possible .",
    "@xcite recently published a method to improve @xmath5 estimates for giant stars in the kepler field that have also been observed with lamost .",

    "as noted in section  2 , our algorithm tends to overestimate the distances to metal - poor halo giants in synthetic catalogs from the besanon model .",
    "it is well established that the metal - poor stellar populations of the milky way halo are typically enhanced in @xmath117-elements relative to disk populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath115 ) halo stars typically having @xmath11/fe]@xmath119 .",
    "we now return to a subset of stars for which we have lamost stellar parameters , and examine the effect of replacing the solar - scaled isochrones with @xmath117-enhanced versions in our distance code .",
    "to do so , we generate a new isochrone grid with @xmath11/fe ] = + 0.4 , [ fe / h]@xmath115 , and the same steps in age as the original isochrone set .",
    "we run our distance algorithm on a set of stellar parameters from 239,446 lamost spectra ( comprised of recent , third - year lamost spectra ) with the @xmath117-enhanced isochrones . from the resulting distance catalog",
    ", we then select out only likely metal - poor halo stars with s / n@xmath116 in @xmath120-bands , @xmath114[fe / h]@xmath115 , @xmath121 , and at least 3  kpc from the galactic plane .",

    "figure  [ alpha_enhanced_dist ] compares the distance from the @xmath117-enhanced grid to the distance from the original isochrone grid , in the sense @xmath122 .",
    "we find that the @xmath11/fe ] = + 0.4 grid produces distances on average 13% nearer than those from the @xmath11/fe ] = 0.0 grid .",
    "this likely explains the @xmath1 systematic overestimation of distances for halo stars from the besanon catalogs . because halo populations in the besanon model were oxygen - enhanced relative to disk populations @xcite , our assumption of solar @xmath117-abundances likely biases the derived distances .",
    "adopting a more appropriate @xmath117-enhanced isochrone grid for metal - poor halo stars would remedy this situation .",
    "indeed , one would ideally incorporate a measured @xmath11/fe ] from the lamost spectrum itself into the distance estimation for each star ; we will include this in future upgrades to the distance code as abundance estimates become available for lamost stars .          of the @xmath8  million stellar spectra in the lamost catalog , @xmath123 of them ( @xmath124 )",
    "are stars with repeat observations .",
    "there are 214,514 unique stars that have been observed multiple times and have sufficient quality spectra at each epoch to derive stellar parameters .",
    "an individual star may have as many as 14 observations , but most have 2 - 4 observations ; the distribution of the number of repeat measurements is shown in figure  [ lamost_ngrps ] .",
    "figure  [ lamostrepeats ] shows the standard deviation of our distance measurements for stars with multiple observations .",
    "this is expressed as a fractional deviation of the mean measured distance , @xmath125d@xmath126 , and plotted as a function of the minimum signal to noise of the measurements being compared .",
    "one would expect that the scatter in derived distances would increase if one ( or more ) of the spectra has low s / n .",

    "this verifies that ( a ) our code produces repeatable results when applied to multiple observations of the same star , and ( b ) the lamost pipeline provides consistent estimates of stellar parameters from these multiple observations .     of the distance estimate for the 214,514 stars with multiple measurements in lamost",

    "the scatter from repeat measurements is typically @xmath94 for high @xmath130 stars ( min .",
    "s / n@xmath131 ) , then increases to @xmath1 at the low s / n end .",

    "this peak metallicity , which is typical of the galactic thick disk , persists as far out as we probe , with a long tail to lower metallicity .",
    "]      after running our distance code on the entire catalog of lamost stellar parameters , we perform some checks to verify that the results make sense , and to explore the utility of our distances for galactic structure studies .",
    "using our distances , we calculate galactocentric cartesian coordinates ( assuming the sun is at @xmath135  kpc , with @xmath136  kpc ) .",
    "the first test is to see whether the metallicity distribution as a function of height above the galactic plane near the north galactic cap is as expected .",
    "we select stars at @xmath137 , keeping only those with s / n@xmath116 in the sdss @xmath98-band .",
    "this yields 189,106 stars .",
    "this sample should roughly probe the galactic metallicity gradient with height ; one expects that on average the metallicity should be nearly solar close to the plane , and decrease with height as the thin disk transitions into the lower - metallicity thick disk .",
    "indeed , this is exactly what is seen in a contour plot of these data in figure  [ feh_vs_z_hilat ] .",
    "the peak metallicity decreases from slightly subsolar at @xmath138  kpc to [ fe / h]@xmath139 at @xmath134  kpc . above this",
    ", the peak metallicity remains roughly the same , with a long tail to low metallicities representing predominantly local halo stars .",
    "though giant stars in the galactic halo represent a tiny fraction of the stars observed by lamost , we also hope to use them to explore structure ( and substructure ) in the halo .",
    "we thus wish to check whether our distances can be used to isolate a relatively pure sample of milky way halo giants . to test this",
    ", we select stars with galactocentric radii @xmath140  kpc that are also at heights @xmath141  kpc above / below the plane . such a sample of stars should be predominantly halo stars .",
    "we check this by plotting a metallicity histogram ( dashed line in figure  [ hiz_feh ] ) for the 1528 stars selected in this way .",
    "these stars peak at a metallicity around [ fe / h ]  @xmath142 , as expected for inner - halo stars , with very few metal - rich stars .",
    "in contrast , a sample selected to be inside @xmath143  kpc and near the disk ( @xmath144  kpc ; solid line in figure  [ hiz_feh ] ) contains mostly metal - rich stars with disk - like [ fe / h ] .",
    "note that neither of these sanity checks showing metallicity distributions for different galactic populations ( figures  [ feh_vs_z_hilat ] and [ hiz_feh ] ) represents the true galactic metallicity distribution for these populations . to derive",
    "the intrinsic distribution would require correcting the selection effects present in lamost data .",
    "these figures are simply meant to illustrate that stellar samples selected using our derived distances have properties similar to what one might expect based on our knowledge of metallicity distributions of milky way components .",

    "the 1,705 stars at @xmath146  kpc and @xmath140  kpc are represented by the dashed line .",
    "the latter should be mostly halo stars , and peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath147 as expected for the galactic halo , with few metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath148 ) stars .",
    "the @xmath149  kpc sample contains mostly metal - rich stars , as expected for predominantly disk populations .",
    "the abrupt cutoff at [ fe / h]@xmath150 is due to the lower limit of metallicities produced by the lamost pipeline rather than a real effect .",
    "@xcite adapted the sloan sspp for more general usage ; use of this pipeline on lamost spectra avoids the artificial cutoff at [ fe / h]@xmath150 . ]    finally , we search the lamost database for open cluster member stars .",
    "we begin with the compilation of known galactic open clusters available at http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/ocdb/ @xcite . for each cluster in this list , we initially selected all stars from lamost within the published cluster diameter that also have lamost rv within 20 km  s@xmath151 of the published value ( note that we only used clusters with known rvs for this exercise ) .",
    "after this initial cut , we examined histograms of velocities , distances , and metallicities for each of the clusters with more than 15 candidates . for clusters with obvious distance and velocity peaks ,",
    "we manually select stars within @xmath152  km  s@xmath151 of the peak value , and fit a gaussian to the distance distribution of these cluster candidates .",
    "clusters with obvious signatures were ngc  1039 , ngc  1662 , ngc  2168 , ngc  2281 , ngc  2548 , ascc  26 , and ngc  1647 .",
    "the number of candidates selected ranged from 19 to 102 stars , with the nearest clusters having the most candidates . figure  [ lamost_ocs ] compares our measured distances ( from the gaussian fits ) for these seven clusters , @xmath74 , to those from @xcite , @xmath153 .",
    "error bars on these points represent the gaussian @xmath154 of the stars included .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to one - to - one agreement between our measurements and literature values .",
    "all but one of the seven clusters distances is consistent with values from the literature .",
    "thus , we have confirmed the effectiveness of our distance estimations .",
    "this simple exercise highlights the potential of lamost to amass a sample of open cluster stars with homogeneously measured metallicities , velocities , and distances that can be used to probe the galactic disk in exquisite detail .",
    "we present a method to derive distances to stars with measured stellar parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath155 , and [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "this was developed with particular interest in deriving distances to the many millions of stars that will be observed by the lamost survey , in order to enable studies of galactic structure with this vast data set .",
    "the code is based on a bayesian method that evaluates the posterior pdf in absolute magnitude for a given star , estimated via comparison to a grid of theoretical isochrones .",
    "the pdf incorporates information about @xmath4 , @xmath155 , and [ fe / h ] , along with their uncertainties . to account for selection effects ,",
    "we take advantage of the fact that each lamost plate typically observes @xmath7 stars simultaneously .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath5 for stars within 0.25 magnitudes in color - magnitude space is mapped onto theoretical isochrones to derive a proxy `` luminosity function '' expected for stars in that region of sky at the given color and magnitude .",
    "this accounts simultaneously for the selection function through which stars were chosen for lamost observation , and the variation in stellar populations with galactic line of sight ( and distance ) .",
    "a flat age prior is implemented , since we have no information about the ages of individual stars .",
    "this could , in principle , be modified to account for the relatively well - known age - metallicity relation in the milky way , but we choose to leave it flat so as not to bias studies of galactic stellar populations based on lamost data .",

    "* @xmath153 ) for seven open clusters found in lamost .",
    "points represent the central value of the best - fitting gaussian for each cluster s distance distribution , and error bars show the gaussian @xmath154 .",
    "the dashed line represents one - to - one agreement .",
    "all but one of the clusters agrees very closely with the known distance . ]",
    "we test our code by measuring distances to samples of stars from hipparcos and rave that have known stellar parameters .",
    "our distances agree with the parallax distances from hipparcos , with roughly 17% scatter in the residuals .",
    "we find a 12% systematic shift between our distances and those measured by @xcite from the same rave sample , with only 16% scatter , but with a large tail toward underestimate of the distance .",
    "we also test our code on simulated data along two lines of sight from the besanon model , and find that we recover the model distances with no net offset .",
    "there is , however , an apparent @xmath1 overestimate of distances to distant , metal - poor halo stars by our code .",
    "the source of this systematic shift is unclear , but it may be due to the fact that we have used isochrones with solar @xmath117-element abundances .",
    "stars in the milky way halo are , on average , old and @xmath117-enhanced relative to the solar neighborhood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because the rgb of an isochrone is shifted slightly to fainter absolute magnitudes when @xmath11/fe ] is increased ( at fixed [ fe / h ] and age ) , the use of solar - scaled isochrones will tend to bias results for @xmath117-rich stars toward overestimation of distances .",
    "we confirmed this impression by re - running the distance derivation for a subset of metal - poor halo giants , using an @xmath117-enhanced isochrone grid ( @xmath11/fe]@xmath156 ) .",
    "indeed , this exercise shifted the distance estimates for these stars by an average of 13% closer than the estimates based on the solar - alpha grid .",
    "thus we suggest that adopting a more appropriate @xmath117-enhanced isochrone set for metal - poor halo stars would remedy the overestimation of distances to these stars , and that ultimately the measured [ @xmath117/fe ] should be incorporated into the distance estimation process .    finally , we present some results based on lamost data . a sample of @xmath157 stars near the north galactic cap shows expected trends in [ fe / h ] with height ( @xmath36 ) above the galactic plane .",
    "we also show that a sample selected to be distant halo stars based on our derived distances consists solely of metal - poor stars with a distribution peaked around [ fe / h]@xmath147 , as expected for the galactic inner halo .",
    "some studies of kinematics of nearby stars based on lamost data and with distances from this code have already appeared in the literature @xcite , and we anticipate that distances derived by this method will prove useful for numerous upcoming studies of galactic structure . furthermore , as the lamost data reduction pipelines continue to improve , we anticipate that uncertainties on stellar parameters derived from the spectra will become smaller , which will in turn improve our estimates of the distances . eventually , parallaxes that will come from the @xmath158 mission @xcite will likely supersede these distance measurements for the majority of the stars observed by lamost , as part of a vast sample of direct distance measurements throughout the galaxy .",
