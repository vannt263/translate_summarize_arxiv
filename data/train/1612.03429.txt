    "<S> _ nonlinear oscillations , i.e. , oscillations with relatively large amplitudes , which are described by nonlinear dynamical models , appear in a wide range of systems , including mechanical oscillators @xcite , electric circuits @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , and biological systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence and stability of such nonlinear oscillators is very often associated with the existence of a stable periodic attractor , i.e. , a limit cycle , for the corresponding dynamical model . in many physical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the stable limit cycle is due to a supercritical hopf bifurcation @xcite . in this case , as the value of a physical parameter is changed beyond some threshold value , a stable equilibrium state of the dynamical model becomes unstable , and a stable limit cycle about the unstable equilibrium state appears @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> supercritical hopf bifurcations are known to occur in many physical systems , including electric circuits @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , and population dynamics @xcite . in the current study , we are interested in lotka - volterra models , which are known to describe dynamics of population sizes @xcite as well as the time evolution of chemical concentrations in certain chemical reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of supercritical hopf bifurcations in lv models is of special interest , since in some cases , as the value of the bifurcation parameter is further changed , the limit cycle undergoes a period doubling cascade , and finally , chaotic dynamics is observed @xcite .    in the current paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study multisequence transmission of optical solitons in nonlinear waveguide systems with linear and cubic gain - loss . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the solitons in each sequence propagate with the same frequency and group velocity , but the frequency and group velocity are different for solitons from different sequences @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> intersequence soliton collisions are frequent and can lead to transmission degradation and significant amplitude shifts . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we showed that dynamics of soliton amplitudes in @xmath1-sequence nonlinear waveguide systems can be described by @xmath1-dimensional lv models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we showed that stability analysis of the equilibrium states of the lv models can be used for realizing transmission stabilization and switching @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , the results of these studies were limited to weakly nonlinear amplitude dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the main obstacle for observing intermediate and strongly nonlinear amplitude dynamics is due to the instability of multisequence transmission of conventional optical solitons against resonant emission of small - amplitude waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , intermediate or strongly nonlinear amplitude dynamics has not yet been observed in multisequence transmission with conventional optical solitons , or in any other physical system with cubic nonlinearity and multiple sequences of colliding solitons .    in the current paper , we demonstrate that the amplitudes of conventional optical solitons in multisequence nonlinear waveguide coupler systems with linear and cubic gain - loss can exhibit intermediate nonlinear dynamics . for this purpose , </S>",

    "<S> we assume that kerr nonlinearity is narrowband , i.e. , that it is negligible for frequency differences that are much larger than the spectral width of the pulses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we assume that cubic gain - loss is broadband , i.e. , that it is non - negligible only for frequency differences that are much larger than the spectral width of the pulses . as a result , we can neglect interchannel interaction due to kerr nonlinearity and intrachannel interaction due to cubic gain - loss . </S>",

    "<S> the black diamonds , green triangles , orange stars , and cyan circles represent @xmath35 with @xmath104 , obtained by the lv model ( [ hb3 ] ) . ]    _ summary . </S>",
    "<S> _ we demonstrated that the amplitudes of optical solitons in multisequence waveguide coupler systems with linear and cubic gain - loss exhibit large stable oscillations along ultra - long distances . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the stable oscillations are caused by hopf bifurcations of the equilibrium states of the lv models for amplitude dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the lv models were confirmed by simulations with the coupled - nls propagation models for @xmath0 sequences . </S>",
    "<S> our results are very surprising , since multisequence transmission with conventional optical solitons is considered to be unstable against radiation emission . moreover , since two of the lv models exhibit chaotic dynamics , our results are an important step towards realization of spatio - temporal chaos with multiple sequences of colliding optical solitons . </S>"
