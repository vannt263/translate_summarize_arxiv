    "<S> fundamental to the rapidly growing field of spintronics is the ability to manipulate spin currents in nanostructures , which promises new implementations of memory and logic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first suggestions on spin injection and its detection date back a few decades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a spin polarized current , @xmath0 injected form a ferromagnet ( f ) into a nonmagnetic conductor ( n ) creates a spin splitting of the chemical potential at the f / n interface , which is directly determined by the spin polarization of the injected current , @xmath1 , @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the resistivity of n and @xmath4 is the electron charge ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are collinear at the injection interface ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is easily illustrated by writing out the spin - up and spin - down currents in n using @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the equilibrium , spin independent electrochemical potential in n. @xmath11 is either constant or varies linearly with coordinate in regions of non - zero electric field @xmath12 , where it produces a charge current , @xmath13 the important prediction of eq.[jupdown ] for regions of zero @xmath12 ( outside the path of @xmath6 ) is that the current of spin - up electrons is exactly compensated by the opposing current of spin - down electrons , which diminishes the charge flow and doubles the spin flow associated with @xmath14 : @xmath15 . for regions of n with non - zero @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> the spin and charge currents are superposed . </S>",
    "<S> the two currents are restricted to the same path only in the pure 1-d case , typical for giant magneto resistance structures @xcite , but have very different profiles in the general case where the driving electric field is non - uniform in n. to date no experimental evidence exists , which unambiguously verifies spin - charge current decoupling in nanostructures and controversies persist in the analysis of multi - terminal spin based devices @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we directly demonstrate that spin and charge currents are strictly decoupled in diffusive 1d spin channels .    </S>",
    "<S> johnson and byers propose an ideal system for demonstrating decoupling of spin and charge currents @xcite , consisting of a conductive nano - wire with a spin imbalance created by a point injection of a spin - polarized current into the wire and spin - sensitive detectors placed symmetrically about the injection point , which is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the fundamental decoupling of the spin and charge currents can be demonstrated by detecting spin signals of _ precisely equal strength _ in both directions from the injection point while the charge current flows in only one direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is essential that the magnetic detectors are closely spaced from the injector within the spin relaxation length in n , @xmath16100 nm for typical metal films . </S>",
    "<S> the detectors are probe tunnel junctions , which should have identical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization states of the detectors must also be arranged by external means to achieve parallel and anti - parallel configurations with respect to the injector . for this 1-d geometry , with a point - like injection at @xmath17 , the solution of eq.[diff ] </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath18 the spin signal at the detector is a direct measure of @xmath14 : @xmath19 this spin signal is compared for the local and non - local case , where the detector is inside and outside the charge current path , respectively . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report a simultaneous and differential measurement of such local and non - local spin signals , which clearly demonstrates a complete spin - charge decoupling for currents in nanostructures .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows a sem micrograph of the sample fabricated using a two - angle deposition through a lift - off mask , which was patterned by e - beam lithography . </S>",
    "<S> the injector and detector junctions are formed by depositing and oxidizing a @xmath16100 nm wide and 20 nm thick al strip with a subsequent deposition of 55 , 65 , and 50 nm wide and 40 nm thick co electrodes , overlapping the al strip . </S>",
    "<S> the width and thickness of the al strip are much smaller than the spin flip length , making it a 1d channel for spin diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the co electrodes was varied to achieve different switching fields and thereby multiple stable magnetic states of the device . </S>",
    "<S> it is essential that the magnetic electrodes switch in a single domain fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we found @xcite that in such co based overlap junctions two well defined longitudinal magnetic states with sharp inter - state transitions are obtained for narrow electrodes , 90 nm and less in width . </S>",
    "<S> this length is comparable or slightly smaller than the characteristic domain wall size in thin co. thin , long , and narrow electrodes can be modelled as single domain particles of uniaxial anisotropy , where the width / length ratio determines the longitudinal switching field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the smaller the width the higher the switching field . </S>",
    "<S> such a relation for our geometry is also supported by exact micromagnetic simulations @xcite . in order to fine - tune the width of the co electrodes </S>",
    "<S> we have adjusted the layout of the devices such that the total dose during the mask exposure , including the backscattered electrons , was slightly different for the three magnetic electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , backscattering is strongest for the center electrode , making it the widest ( 65 nm ) of the three and therefore with the lowest switching field ( 1.13 koe ) . </S>",
    "<S> the outer co electrodes were 50 and 55 nm wide with the switching fields of 1.62 and 1.45 koe , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements have been done using a standard lock - in technique at 7 hz , which we found necessary for achieving @xmath20% level resolution in the spin signal measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the ac technique resulted in a weak but non - zero inductive crosstalk between the injection and detection circuits , which scaled to zero with decreasing the excitation frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this small constant background of @xmath21 nv had no influence on the spin - dependent signals studied , which was verified by measuring the latter at different frequencies as well as a dc technique . </S>",
    "<S> the external field was applied along the length of the co electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was electrically characterized as follows : injecting the current from probe 3 to probe 4 ( @xmath22 ) , we measure the non - local voltages @xmath23 and @xmath24 at two distances from the injection point . in this non - local measurement configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the voltage probes are outside the current path . according to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ exp],[vs ] the ratio of these voltages for our 1-d geometry is @xmath25 where @xmath26 nm is the electrode separation and @xmath27 is the spin diffusion length , found to be 850 nm at 4 k. here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the diffusion constant and spin relaxation time , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion constant was calculated from the measured resistivity of the wire , @xmath30 cm , using the einstein relation @xmath31^{-1}=65 $ ] @xmath32s , where @xmath4 is the electron charge and @xmath33 ev@xmath34m@xmath35 is the density of states of al at the fermi energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spin relaxation time is @xmath36 ps , much longer than the drude scattering time , @xmath37 . from the measured spin voltages we can also determine the effective spin polarization @xmath38 ( @xmath39 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these values are in good agreement with the recent spin injection studies on al films @xcite but differ from the early single crystal al data @xcite due to stronger impurity and surface scattering in thin films .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a the local spin signal ( @xmath40 , solid line ) and the non local spin signal ( @xmath23 , dashed line ) are plotted as a function of the applied magnetic field , for @xmath41=5 @xmath42a . </S>",
    "<S> isotropic spin diffusion necessarily results in these two spin voltages being identical in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> a precondition is that the detectors have the same physical characteristics , such as polarization , which is achieved in our case by the simultaneous deposition of all three junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the switching of the injector electrode at 1.13 koe ( @xmath43 ) reverses the sign of the injected spin population in the wire . </S>",
    "<S> this is measured simultaneously by the two detectors and yields _ exactly _ the same spin voltages , thus demonstrating that the spin currents are identical in both directions while the charge current flows only in one direction . </S>",
    "<S> as the field is increased , detector 1 switches ( @xmath44 ) , followed by a switching of the second detector ( @xmath45 ) , again demonstrating the symmetry in the spin current .    </S>",
    "<S> an even more direct demonstration of the effect is the differential spin signal ( @xmath46 ) shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , which , in addition to eliminating the fabrication related uncertainties , also rules out possible measurement errors , such as small differences in gain and drift of the separate amplifiers and small spin misalignments in the junction areas . </S>",
    "<S> the raw differential signal @xmath46 contains the resistive , spin-_independent _ contribution from @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) as well as both spin-_dependent _ signals from @xmath40 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the switching of the injector at 1.13 koe ( @xmath43 ) leaves the differential spin voltage unchanged to within the experimental uncertainty of @xmath49 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) , while the two component signals change by the maximum amount ( fig.3 a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slight skew in the signals in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a , b as the reversing field is increased is connected with small spin perturbations in the junction areas caused by the opposing external field ( < 1.65 koe ) . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize however , that the power of our symmetric detection scheme is in eliminating this micromagnetic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the magnetic state of the injector at a given point in field ( 1.13 koe ) changes both spin signals by the same maximum amount . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetic states of the detector electrodes , even if slightly misaligned , are not affected by this instantaneous switching of the injector . </S>",
    "<S> the differential signal therefore remains unchanged ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b at 1.13 koe ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a difference in width for the two detector electrodes was necessary to separately control the respective magnetic states by an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the small uncertainty this introduces can be estimated as follows . from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ exp],[vs],[vratio ] the variation in detector width from 50 to 55 nm can be estimated to produce a 0.06% change in the detector voltage . </S>",
    "<S> a change in the detector width of even a factor of 2 ( 50 nm to 100 nm ) would still have a very small effect on the the effective spin signal detected ( @xmath20% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty due to the difference in width of our two detectors ( 5 nm ) is thus negligible , determined by the relatively large scale set by the spin diffusion length . </S>",
    "<S> the relative weight of the detector placement error is on the other hand larger , and follows directly from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ vratio ] . our experimental placement error for the sample discussed above is approximately 5 nm corresponding to a 0.6% change in the detector voltage , which is still within the @xmath50% precision we report . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured several samples with well controlled magnetic switching and similar geometrical uncertainties , all confirming the above result at the 1% level .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we use a multi - terminal spintronic device to unambiguously verify the complete decoupling of spin and charge currents in the regime of diffusive transport . </S>",
    "<S> the important consequence of this decoupling is that numerous recently proposed multi - terminal spin - based devices should benefit in sensitivity by use of non - local as opposed to local spin currents . </S>"
