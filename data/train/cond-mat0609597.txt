    "there is considerable interest to understand the effects on the properties of a particle coming from interactions with an environment .",
    "examples of such problems abound in condensed matter ; the problem discussed here is that of an electron coupled to lattice vibrations , i.e. of electron - phonon coupling . for example , such coupling is believed to be relevant for understanding certain aspects of the high - temperature superconductors behavior in the underdoped limit ( where the `` particle '' coupling to phonons is the doping hole already dressed by interactions with the electrons in the lower hubbard band)@xcite but there are many examples of other materials characterized by strong - electron phonon coupling , including polymers like polyacetylene , nanotubes , c@xmath0 molecules and other fullerenes.@xcite other problems of the same general type regard electrons coupled to spin - waves of a magnetically ordered system,@xcite or to orbitrons , for example in manganites,@xcite or to some combination thereof .    in this work , we focus on the simplest hamiltonian describing an electron on a lattice interacting with an optical phonon mode , namely the holstein model:@xcite @xmath1 the first term is the kinetic energy of the electron , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the electron creation and annihilation operators . for the single dressed particle ( known as polaron , in this case ) problem of interest to us , the spin of",
    "the particle is irrelevant and we suppress its index .",
    "@xmath4 is the free - particle dispersion . in all results shown here",
    ", we assume nearest - neighbor hopping on a @xmath5-dimensional simple cubic lattice of constant @xmath6 and a total of @xmath7 sites with periodic boundary conditions , so that @xmath8 but our results are valid for any other dispersion . the second term describes a branch of optical phonons of energy @xmath9 ( we set @xmath10 throughout this paper ) . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the phonon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the last term is the on - site linear electron - phonon coupling @xmath13 , written in @xmath14-space .",
    "all sums over momenta are over the first brillouin zone , @xmath15 .",
    "the quantity of interest to us is the green s function of the single dressed particle , or polaron , defined as:@xcite @xmath16 | 0 \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the ground state of the zero - particle system , which is the vacuum .",
    "@xmath18 is the time ordering operator , and @xmath19 . since @xmath20 and @xmath21 , eq . ( [ eq : green_time_ordered ] )",
    "simplifies to : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the heaviside function . in other words ,",
    "only the retarded part contributes .",
    "this green s function gives the amplitude of probability that an electron introduced in the system at @xmath24 and removed at a later time @xmath25 , leaves the system in its ground state .",
    "the usefulness of this quantity can be appreciated using its lehmann representation:@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the complete set of one - particle eigenstates and eigenenergies , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the poles of the green s function give the _",
    "whole one - particle spectrum _ , while the associated residues , called quasi - particle ( @xmath31 ) weights , give partial information on the nature of the eigenstates .",
    "moreover , the imaginary part of this green s function , called the spectral weight , is directly measured experimentally through angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite    there has already been a large amount of work devoted to understanding the properties of the holstein polaron , and we briefly review some of it here . most of it is numerically - intensive work .",
    "some examples are ( i ) exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods.@xcite these are usually hampered by the fact that even for a finite lattice , the hilbert space is infinite due to the infinite number of possible phonon configurations .",
    "thus , some truncation scheme is needed , but for small phonon frequencies and/or large couplings , the cpu resources needed and run times become prohibitive .",
    "this has led to a number of ( ii ) proposals based on variational approaches to decide which phonon configurations should be included,@xcite as well as ( iii ) various quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods.@xcite a brief review of these is provided in ref . .",
    "of special interest are the so - called diagrammatic monte - carlo simulations@xcite which calculate directly the green s function in imaginary time , by _ numerically _ summing all diagrams in the perturbational expansion .",
    "we make extensive use of comparisons with low - energy results of this method from ref . .",
    "while this method allows in principle the exact calculation of the green s function , the requirement of convergence for the propagator series usually means that only low - energy properties are shown .",
    "finally , there are methods suitable for some particular cases , such as density - matrix renormalization group for one - dimensional systems,@xcite and dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft ) for infinite - dimensional systems.@xcite    of course , given the long history of this problem , many analytical techniques have been applied to it with varying degrees of success ( for a review , see ref . ) .",
    "first of all , the green s function is known exactly in two asymptotic limits .",
    "if there is no coupling , @xmath32 , then the green s function is that of the free electron .",
    "the ground - state is at @xmath33 and the spectrum consists of a continuous band extending from @xmath34 $ ] ( for the tight - binding model ) .",
    "the so - called impurity limit , with @xmath35 , also has an exact solution , given by the lang - firsov formula@xcite @xmath36 this can be viewed as the strong - coupling limit , since for @xmath35 , @xmath37 becomes the important energy scale in the system . in this limit",
    "the electron is localized at one site in real space , therefore it is fully delocalized in @xmath38-space , and the green s function is independent of @xmath38 . the spectrum has the ground - state ( gs ) at @xmath39 and an infinite sequence of equidistant levels spaced by @xmath9 above it .",
    "this is extremely different from the free - particle spectrum , and it is of considerable interest to understand not only how the ground - state evolves from @xmath40 to @xmath41 as the coupling @xmath37 is increased , but also the evolution of all the higher - energy spectral weight from a continuous , finite - width band to an infinite set of discrete levels .",
    "note that it is customary to describe the effective coupling as the ratio of the two asymptotic ground - state energies , using as a new parameter @xmath42    most of the numerical methods reviewed above calculate only gs or low - energy properties , given the significant cpu time and numerical resources needed to calculate the whole spectrum .",
    "very recently , several sets of whole - spectrum results have become available,@xcite however only for a few points in the parameter space , and generally for low dimensions .",
    "it is of obvious interest to find an analytical approximation for the green s function that is simple to estimate , so that the whole parameter space can be studied easily , but also with high accuracy .",
    "this is precisely what we propose here ( a short version of this work has been published in ref . ) .",
    "we call our approximation the momentum average ( ma ) approximation ; its essence consists in analytically summing _ all the diagrams _ in the diagrammatic expansion , but with each diagram simplified in a certain way . before introducing this method ,",
    "we briefly review here the other two simple ( in terms of computational effort ) analytical approximations for the green s function of the holstein polaron , available in the literature .",
    "the first is the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , which consists of summing exactly only the non - crossed diagrams .",
    "the percentage of diagrams kept decreases fast with increasing order ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "if the coupling is small , the sum is dominated by the low order diagrams and scba works reasonably well . at strong coupling ,",
    "the contribution of higher order diagrams becomes essential , and scba is expected to fail ( see below ) . in this approximation , the green s function is written in terms of a self - energy : @xmath43 with the self - consistency condition @xmath44 note that @xmath45 is independent of @xmath38 .",
    "this is a consequence of the simplicity of the holstein model : if either the coupling @xmath37 or the dispersion @xmath9 were functions of the phonon momentum @xmath46 , the scba self - energy would depend explicitly on @xmath38.@xcite @xmath45 can be expressed@xcite as a function of the average of the free propagator over the brillouin zone ( bz ) and can be evaluated very efficiently .",
    ".comparison between the total number of diagrams of a given order in the proper self - energy @xmath47 vs. the number of diagrams of a given order kept within scba .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the other simple analytical approximation for the green s function of the holstein model is the generalized lang - firsov ( lf ) expression.@xcite it is reminiscent of the lang - firsov expression of eq .",

    "ii , we derive the momentum average approximation .",
    "its diagrammatic meaning is discussed in section iii , where we also estimate its corresponding spectral weight sum rules .",
    "we show that ma satisfies exactly the first 6 sum rules , but more importantly , it remains highly accurate for higher order sum rules .",
    "this is a strong argument in favor of its accuracy .",
    "the accuracy is gauged in more detail in section iv , where we compare the ma predictions against the scba and generalized lf predictions , but also against a host of numerical results .",
    "this indeed demonstrates that the ma approximation is remarkably accurate for all parameter values , especially given its simplicity . in this section",
    "we also present some new results regarding various properties of the holstein polaron .",
    "finally , section v contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "as is always the case for green s functions , one can use the equation of motion technique to generate an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for an infinite number of related green s functions .",
    "we derive it here for the holstein polaron .    in the frequency domain ,",
    "this approach is equivalent to using repeatedly dyson s identity @xmath53 , which holds for any green s operators @xmath54^{-1}$ ] , @xmath55^{-1}$ ] and for any hamiltonians @xmath56 . as customary",

    "its own equation of motion relates back to @xmath63 but also to a new green s function with two phonons initially . in general ,",
    "if we define : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total momentum of the @xmath66 initial phonons , using dyson s identity we find its equation of motion to be ( @xmath67 ) : @xmath68,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] i.e. related to the green s functions with @xmath69 and @xmath70 initial phonons .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) form the exact infinite hierarchy of coupled equations whose solution is the holstein polaron green s function @xmath71 .",

    "( [ eq : f ] ) in terms of these simpler quantities , by performing the corresponding momenta averages on both sides .",
    "while the first term on the right - hand side can be written in terms of @xmath93 exactly , the second term requires an approximation , which we choose to be : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the free propagator momentum - averaged over the bz .",
    "one justification for replacing @xmath96 by its momentum average @xmath97 in eq .",

    "( [ app ] ) is exact .",
    "this suggests that our approach should be reasonable at least in the strong - coupling limit @xmath99 . in a more practical sense",
    ", this approximation allows us to write @xmath100 in terms of @xmath101 and @xmath102 only , which is what we require to be able to obtain an analytical expression for @xmath103 .",
    "we discuss the meaning and consequences of this approximation in more detail below .    after the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ app ] ) , eqs .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) these simplified recurrence relations can be solved similarly to the @xmath35 case .",
    "we find : @xmath105 where the self - energy is , within the ma approximation , @xmath106 this is the main new result of this work . as discussed , the ma approximation becomes exact in the limit of zero hopping ( @xmath35 ) , where @xmath107 , but also for zero coupling , @xmath32 . in the following sections we show that the range of validity of this approximation extends well beyond these asymptotic limits , and that in fact the ma expression is reasonably accurate over the entire parameter space .    note that although the ma self - energy looks similar to the dmft self - energy,@xcite this is in fact a very different approximation .",
    "this issue is discussed in appendix [ dmft ] .",

    "first , one can verify that the ma approximation generates the correct number of proper self - energy diagrams to all orders .",
    "indeed , there is one term of order @xmath108 , two terms of order @xmath110 , 4 + 6=10 terms of order @xmath111 , and so on ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , to each of these terms we can associate an ma diagram .",
    "these have the same topology as the exact proper self - energy diagrams .",
    "the difference is that each free propagator @xmath112 in the exact self - energy diagrams is replaced with a momentum averaged free propagator @xmath113 ( with the correct frequency ) in each ma diagram .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) , the first - order self - energy diagram is ( see fig . [ fig : self_energy ] ) : @xmath114 i.e. @xmath115 , and thus ma is exact to first order .",
    "differences appear from the second order diagrams , where the two exact contributions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : self_energy ] ) : @xmath116\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] are replaced , within ma , by two equal contributions : @xmath117 comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : second_exact ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : second_ma ] ) , we see that the ma self - energy diagrams have the correct number of free propagators with the correct frequencies , however the momenta of the free propagators are un - correlated and individually averaged over .",
    "it is as if there is no connection between the momentum carried by a cloud phonon when it is emitted and when it is re - absorbed by the electron .",
    "precisely the same holds for all higher order self - energy diagrams .    to gain a better understanding of the difference between the exact and the ma diagrams ,",
    "let us further analyze the dependence on @xmath52 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : second_exact ] ) and ( [ eq : second_ma ] ) . for @xmath35",
    "the expressions are identical , because the free propagators become independent of momenta and , as already discussed , ma becomes exact . for finite @xmath52",
    ", we expand each free propagator as : @xmath118,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 . inserting this expansion into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : second_exact ] ) and ( [ eq : second_ma ] ) and collecting powers of @xmath52 yields the following .",
    "all @xmath120 terms vanish in both the exact and the ma diagrams because they are proportional to a @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , all odd - order powers in @xmath52 vanish because @xmath122 .",
    "next , consider terms of order @xmath123 .",
    "such terms arise either from expanding one free propagator to @xmath124 , or from expanding two different free propagators to @xmath120 .",
    "the former case leads to the same result for both the exact and the ma diagrams , and we obtain 6 contributions proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "the latter case , however , reveals a difference .",
    "five of the six @xmath124 such contributions from the exact diagrams vanish because they involve propagators carrying different momenta , and , for example , @xmath126 .",
    "the exception comes from the two outside free propagators of the non - crossed diagram , which carry the same momentum and result into another @xmath127 contribution .",
    "this is absent in the ma approximation , where different propagators always carry different momenta .",
    "it follows that the ma second order self - energy diagrams capture 6 out of the 7 finite @xmath124 contributions correctly .",
    "similar considerations apply for higher order @xmath52 powers and for higher order diagrams , differences between the ma and the exact self - energy diagrams coming only from terms involving free propagators carrying equal momenta in non - crossed diagrams .",
    "however , the error from such missed terms becomes smaller and smaller as one goes to higher order diagrams because the percentage of self - energy diagrams with one or more pairs of free propagators of equal momenta decreases exponentially .",
    "we conclude that the ma approximation captures most of the @xmath52 dependence of each self - energy diagram , while summing over all diagrams .",
    "this analysis suggests that ma should be quite accurate for any finite @xmath37 and @xmath52 values . in the next section",
    ", we reinforce this conclusion by analyzing the sum rules of the spectral weight .",
    "for an even better idea of the accuracy of the ma approximation , we consider the sum rules for the spectral weight @xmath128 : @xmath129 for a problem of this type ( single dressed particle ) , the sum rules can be calculated exactly to arbitrary order .",
    "the usual approach is based on the equation of motion technique.@xcite we review it briefly here in order to make a few useful observations .",
    "the key step is to rewrite @xmath130 , so that we have : @xmath131 the integral is now simply @xmath132 . using the definition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : green_simplified ] ) , we find , for any @xmath133 : @xmath134 so that the sum rules simplify to : @xmath135 these vacuum expectation values can be evaluated directly with some effort .",
    "we find @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , etc .",
    "one very important conclusion that can be drawn from this derivation is that these sum rules have the same functional dependence on the energy scales @xmath140 anywhere in the parameter space . of course , in various asymptotic regimes ,",
    "different terms dominate the overall value ( _ e.g. _ @xmath141 if @xmath142 while @xmath143 if @xmath144 ) .",
    "however , this shows that if one can evaluate the sum rules _ exactly _ in any asymptotic regime , for instance by using perturbation theory , the results hold true _ everywhere _ in the parameter space , even where perturbation fails .",
    "the second important conclusion one can draw from eq . ( [ sr ] ) is that each term in @xmath145 is proportional to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 are integers , i.e. the sum rule @xmath148 is a polynomial of total order @xmath66 in the energy scales of the problem .",
    "more complicated dependence on @xmath149 , for example through @xmath150 , simply can not appear ( see below ) .",
    "the first conclusion suggests an alternative derivation of the sum rules , which can also be used for the ma and scba sum rules .",
    "namely , we use the diagrammatic perturbational expansion of the green s function valid for @xmath144 to evaluate directly the integrals @xmath151 and retain the imaginary part . in this case , @xmath152 , where @xmath153 are all green s function diagrams of order @xmath66 , i.e. containing @xmath66 phonon lines . the multiplicity @xmath154 .",
    "each diagram @xmath155 is a product of @xmath156 free propagators , summed over internal phonon momenta . since for large frequency each @xmath157",
    ", it follows that for @xmath158 , each @xmath159 . since any integrand that decreases faster than @xmath160 has a vanishing contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum_rule ] ) , it follows that the diagrams of order @xmath66 only contribute to the sum rules @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "thus , even though @xmath103 is the sum of an infinite number of diagrams , only a finite number of them , of low order , contribute to any given sum rule and the calculation can be done .",
    "the same holds true for the ma sum rules , the only difference being that the self - energy parts in the green s functions diagrams are replaced with the corresponding ma self - energy parts .",
    "let us analyze the differences between contributions of the exact and of the ma diagrams to the sum rules .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that : @xmath163 @xmath164 and @xmath165.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] both the exact and the ma diagrams of order @xmath66 contain products of the general form @xmath166 .",
    "some of the free propagators are actually @xmath112 ( always the first and the last one , but there can also be intermediary ones connecting proper self - energy parts ) .",
    "all other free propagators have momenta dependent on the phonon momenta , which are summed over ( in the exact diagrams ) , or are individually averaged over ( in the ma diagrams ) .",
    "since there is one - to - one correspondence between the number of exact vs. ma diagrams and their topologies , and since @xmath167 , it follows that the exact and the ma diagrams of order @xmath66 give precisely the same contributions to @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "differences appear in the contribution to @xmath170 if there is at least one pair of propagators in any of the self - energy parts of the exact diagram that carry the same momenta . in this case , the corresponding @xmath171 averages to @xmath172 when the sums over phonon momenta are carried for the exact diagrams , whereas these terms always average to zero for the ma diagrams .",
    "since most free propagators in the self - energy parts have different momenta , such differences are quantitatively small .",
    "this is especially true for large phonon frequencies @xmath9 , where the contributions proportional to @xmath9 captured correctly by ma scale like some power of @xmath156 .",
    "this analysis can be continued for higher sum rules , with similar conclusions .",
    "we can now summarize our findings .",
    "only the @xmath173 order green s function diagram ( the free propagator @xmath174 ) contributes to @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "since this is included correctly in the ma and the scba cases , both give the correct @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "in fact , this diagram contributes an @xmath177 to @xmath145 , which is always the leading power in @xmath52 contribution .",
    "the 1@xmath178 order diagram is also exact in both the ma and scba cases , therefore both give the correct @xmath179 and @xmath180 sum rules as well .",
    "differences appear from @xmath181 onwards . because scba only keeps 2 out the 3 second order green s function diagrams , and 5 out of 15 third order diagrams , etc . , the leading terms in @xmath37 are @xmath182 instead of @xmath183 in @xmath184 , @xmath185 instead of @xmath186 in @xmath187 , etc .",
    "this shows that scba fails all sum rules with @xmath188 significantly in the strong coupling regime where the term proportional to @xmath189 gives the most significant contribution to @xmath168 ( similar conclusions hold for odd sum rules ) .",
    "so even though scba always satisfies exactly the first 4 sum rules , it is a bad approximation for large @xmath37 , where big discrepancies appear for @xmath188 .    .",

    "the leading term in @xmath111 has the correct prefactor , because ma has the correct number of 3rd order diagrams .",

    "as far as ma is concerned , fig . [ bayo ] suggests that for couplings where there is more than one discrete state , the very little weight in the @xmath305 and similar higher - energy continua is absorbed in the discrete states predicted by ma .",

    "in fact , it is straightfoward to see that the ma approximation can only predict a continuum starting at @xmath307 .",

    "as the coupling increases , bound states start to split from this continuum , and spectral weight is shifted to lower energies , in good agreement with the sum - rule predictions of the exact solution .",

    "<S> we present a novel , highly efficient yet accurate analytical approximation for the green s function of a holstein polaron . </S>",
    "<S> it is obtained by summing all the self - energy diagrams , but with each self - energy diagram averaged over the momenta of its free propagators . </S>",
    "<S> the result becomes exact for both zero bandwidth and for zero electron - phonon coupling , and is accurate everywhere in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting green s function satisfies exactly the first six spectral weight sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> all higher sum rules are satisfied with great accuracy , becoming asymptotically exact for coupling both much larger and much smaller than the free particle bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with existing numerical data also confirms this accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we use this approximation to analyze in detail the redistribution of the spectral weight as the coupling strength varies . </S>"
