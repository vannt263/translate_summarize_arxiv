    "the observational evidence for dark matter indicates the intriguing possibility of a `` dark sector '' extension to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "dark matter in fact may be a small part of the dark sector or indeed many dark sectors could exist , each with their own `` dark forces '' and constituent particles .",
    "dark matter may be accompanied by hereto unknown gauge bosons ( `` dark force '' carriers , ) which can couple dark matter particles and ordinary particles with exceptionally weak couplings .",
    "modern colliders can be blind to such new forces , even though the mass of the `` dark force '' carriers can be quite small .",
    "this is because the cross - sections of relevant processes for ordinary matter are so small that the `` dark force '' events are simply statistically insignificant and are discarded in high - energy experiments .",
    "dark sector light weakly - coupled particles that interact with ordinary matter have been proposed as explanations of astronomical anomalies @xcite as well as discrepancies between calculated and measured muon magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "such interactions would be inevitably below the weak force scale , ergo , the dark sector has so far escaped detection .",
    "there are several proposed inroads into the detection of weakly - coupled particles and their associated dark forces   @xcite .",
    "one such example is the dark photon @xcite that is hypothesized to be a massive particle which couples to electromagnetic currents just like the photon does . in addition , dark z bosons have been proposed @xcite that couple to the weak neutral currents , ( i.e. , their interactions are parity violating . ) in a sense dark photons are massive photons while dark z bosons are light - versions of z bosons . from here on we will refer to this type of dark force mediator particle as the light gauge - boson . motivated by such `` dark force '' ideas here we place constraints both on couplings and masses of dark force carriers ( light gauge bosons ) by reinterpreting results of experiments on searches for permanent electric dipole moments ( edms ) of diamagnetic atoms .",
    "specifically we focus on dark forces generated by the p , t - odd interaction of electrons and nucleons through the exchange of a massive light gauge boson .",
    "we will refer to the carrier as @xmath1 .",
    "effectively , the usually - employed contact interactions are replaced with yukawa - like interactions .    standard model ( sm ) predicts the existence of intrinsic permanent electric dipole moments ( edm ) in particles as varied as quarks , leptons , and baryons .",
    "these sm predictions , however , are below the current levels of experimental accuracy . as an example , in the sm framework , the electron edm is estimated to be of the order of @xmath2 ( see e.g. , ref  @xcite ) while the most stringent experimental limit stands at @xmath3 from the tho molecular search @xcite . remarkably , however , there are many theoretical extensions to the sm that predict edm values comparable to the present experimental constraints .",
    "overall , the searches for atomic edm can be classified into two major categories : edm of paramagnetic atoms and molecules and diamagnetic atoms .",
    "paramagnetic atoms , such as tl and cs , have an unpaired valence electron and the atomic edm in this category is attributed to the edm of the unpaired electron .",
    "diamagnetic atoms , on the other hand , are closed - shell atoms . in discussions of diamagnetic atomic edms , the edm is usually associated with the intrinsic edm of an unpaired nucleon ( schiff moment or p , t - odd electron - nucleon interactions ) . the best limit on a diamagnetic atom so far is  @xcite @xmath4 while we will use the hg edm result for putting constraints on the light mediators , the formalism and derived analytical expressions are applicable to other diamagnetic systems , such as the atoms of current experimental interest : xenon  @xcite , ytterbium  @xcite , radon  @xcite , and radium  @xcite .",
