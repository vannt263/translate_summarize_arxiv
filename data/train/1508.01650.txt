    "since the measurement of the large @xmath6 at reno , daya bay , and double chooz , the precise measurement of neutrino mass hierarchy , the sign of @xmath7 , has become the focus in neutrino physics@xcite .",
    "it had been believed that the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined through long - baseline experiments , mainly using accelerator neutrino beams .",
    "recently , the capability of a reactor neutrino experiment at an intermediate baseline to distinguish normal or inverted hierarchy was reported .    for an intermediate - baseline neutrino experiment ,",
    "many approaches have been proposed ; they can be categorized into the @xmath8 analysis methods , which are discussed in refs.@xcite , and the fourier - transform methods@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 analysis methods based on the newly adopted bayesian approach utilizes all the available information from experiments , and it is straightforward to incorporate the uncertainties in order to evaluate the sensitivity , providing robust and complementary results in the fourier - transform methods@xcite .",
    "although the @xmath8 analysis methods are attractive and interesting , the fourier - transform methods are more intuitive .",
    "the prominent merit of the fourier - transform methods are that the mass hierarchy can be extracted without precise knowledge of the reactor antineutrino spectrum , the absolute value of the large @xmath1 , and the energy scale of a detector .",
    "the fourier - transform methods were introduced to enhance and visualize the structures of mass hierarchy in the frequency spectrum , as first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in principle",
    ", the mass hierarchy can be determined through precise measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath9 is very small and is only @xmath10 of @xmath1 , we have to measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 with a precision much better than @xmath11 .",
    "however , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been measured in many experiments with only @xmath12 precision@xcite .",
    "the intermediate baseline based on reactor neutrino experiments has been explored using the precise measurement of distortions of the energy spectrum with negligible matter effect . learned _",
    "proposed a new method to distinguish normal and inverse hierarchy after a fourier transform of the @xmath3 spectrum of reactor neutrinos@xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the fourier power spectrum has a small but not negligible shoulder next to the main peak , and its relative position could be used to extract the mass hierarchy while a non - zero @xmath13 is considered .    in this paper , we analyze the sensitivity of medium - baseline reactor antineutrino experiments to the neutrino mass hierarchy for a baseline range of 3060 km and overall energy resolution , @xmath14 , in the range of 0 to @xmath15 with the fourier - transform method . the optimal baseline length is estimated based on the expected probability of determination .",
    "in a nuclear reactor , antineutrinos are mainly produced via the @xmath16-decay of the fission products of the four types of radioactive isotopes , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , in the fuel .",
    "the antineutrino flux having energy @xmath19 in mev with thermal power @xmath20 in @xmath21 is given as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the relative fission contribution and the energy released per fission of isotope @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath26 is the number of antineutrinos produced per fission and is obtained as follows@xcite : @xmath27 the antineutrino flux is modulated by neutrino oscillation .",
    "the antineutrino survival probability @xmath28 is expressed as @xmath29 the oscillation phase @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 with a baseline @xmath32 . as @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "appear simultaneously in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the effects of mass hierarchy on @xmath28 are hardly recognized . by using the relation between the squared mass differences , @xmath35 we rearrange eq .",
    "( 3 ) to eliminate the @xmath34 term as follows : @xmath36 the plus ( minus ) sign in the fifth term on the right - hand side of eq . ( 6 ) corresponds to the normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy or nh ( ih ) in short .    in ongoing reactor experiments",
    ", we assume that protons will be used as targets to detect electron antineutrinos via the inverse - beta - decay ( ibd ) , which produces a neutron and positron .",
    "the antineutrino distribution observed with a detector having @xmath37 free protons can be expressed for an exposure time @xmath38 as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cross section of the ibd process and @xmath32 is the baseline length .",
    "we use the distribution of the expected antineutrino events from the above expression . for the ibd cross section ,",
    "we use the following expression from vogel and beacom s work@xcite : @xmath41    in order to study the sensitivity of the mass hierarchy , we use fourier - transform method together with monte  carlo simulations to compare the simulated ibd energy spectrum with the expected spectrum in both the nh and ih cases .    taking into account the detector response , the reactor electron antineutrino @xmath0 @xmath3 spectrum becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the actual @xmath0 energy , @xmath44 is the observed @xmath0 energy with the detector response , @xmath45 is the energy resolution , and @xmath46 describes the detector response function including effects such as the energy resolution and energy scale . in this study , we take the normalized gaussian function as the response function : @xmath47 as the neutrino energy is usually measured using scintillators , the energy is typically proportional to the number of photoelectrons , and the error is dominated by the photoelectron statistics .",
    "therefore , the neutrino energy resolution is proportional to @xmath48 . in general",
    ", the detector energy resolution is parameterized into two parts : @xmath49 the first term represents the uncertainty from statistical fluctuation , and the second term originates from the systematic uncertainty . in this study , @xmath50 is assumed for simplicity .",
    "before the measurement of the surprisingly large @xmath51 , it had been known that at the oscillation maximum of @xmath52 , which corresponds to a baseline of approximately 58 km , the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy is maximized at @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath51 is no longer small , the sensitivity to mass hierarchy needs to be explored as a function of the baseline , @xmath32 , and the detector energy resolution , @xmath54 .    in this study , each monte  carlo experiment generates a set of 500,000 @xmath0 events by sampling @xmath55 with input parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath54 .",
    "the default oscillation parameters are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and listed in table [ parameter ] , together with the explored ranges of baseline and energy resolution .",
    ".[parameter]default values of neutrino oscillation parameters and the explored ranges of other input parameters .",

    "we have studied the experimental requirements to determine neutrino mass hierarchy using fourier sine and cosine transform of the reactor neutrino @xmath3 spectrum at @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 were defined to extract features of the fourier sine and cosine spectra , and the mass hierarchy could be obtained from the determination probability , @xmath58 based on bayes theorem .",
    "since the effect of varying @xmath1 over its uncertainty has little effect on the fst and fct spectra at @xmath4 , the @xmath58 is less dependent on the uncertainty of @xmath1 than the value of @xmath6 .    as defined in eq .",
    "( 16 ) and eq .",
    "( 17 ) , the probability @xmath58 is closely related to the different features of each mass hierarchy .",
    "each value of @xmath58 indicates the probability that an experiment will be found inside its correct @xmath59 or @xmath60 region on the @xmath56 and @xmath61 planes .",
    "these different features from different neutrino mass hierarchies suggest that the analysis method described in this paper , which is a simple and straightforward approach , can be used to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy by using the determination probability @xmath58 based on the fourier sine and cosine transform of the @xmath3 spectrum .",
