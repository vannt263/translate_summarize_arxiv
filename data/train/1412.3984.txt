    "the classic art gallery problem ( agp ) posed by klee in 1973 asks for the minimum number of guards sufficient to watch an art gallery modelled by an @xmath5-sided simple polygon @xmath0 .",
    "a guard sees a point in @xmath0 if the connecting line segment is contained in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a guard watches a star polygon contained in @xmath0 and the question is to cover @xmath0 by a collection of stars with smallest possible cardinality .",
    "the answer is @xmath11 as shown by chvtal , @xcite .",
    "this result was the starting point for a rich body of research about algorithms , complexity and combinatorial aspects for many variants of the original question .",
    "surveys can be found in the seminal monograph by orourke @xcite , in shermer @xcite or urrutia @xcite .",
    "graph coloring arguments have been frequently used for proving worst case combinatorial bounds for art gallery type questions starting with fisk s proof @xcite .",
    "somehow surprisingly , chromatic versions of the agp have been proposed and studied only recently .",
    "there are two chromatic variants : strong and conflict - free chromatic guarding of a polygon @xmath0 . in both versions",
    "we look for a guard set @xmath12 and give each guard one of @xmath1 colors .",
    "the chromatic guarding is said to be strong if for each point @xmath2 all guards @xmath13 that see @xmath3 have pairwise different colors @xcite .",
    "it is conflict - free if in each @xmath13 there is at least one guard with a unique color , see @xcite .",
    "the goal is to determine guard sets such that the number of colors sufficient for these purposes is minimal .",
    "observe , in both versions minimizing the number of guards is not part of the objective function .",
    "figure [ cf_st_example ] shows a simple orthogonal polygon with both conflict - free and strong chromatic guardings in the r - visibility model .        to grasp the nature of the problem , observe that it has two conflicting aspects .",
    "we have to guard the polygon but at the same time we want the guards to hide from each other , since then we can give them the same color .",
    "for example , in the strong version we want a guard set that can be partitioned into a minimal number of subsets and in each subset the pairwise link distance is at least 3 .",
    "moreover , we will see a strong dependence of the results on the underlying visibility model , l - visibility vs. r - visibility .",
    "we use superscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the bounds to indicate the model .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the minimal number of colors sufficient for any simple polygon on @xmath5 vertices in the strong chromatic and in the conflict - free version if based on line visibility",
    ".    here is a short summary of known bounds . for simple orthogonal polygons on @xmath5 vertices @xmath18 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the same bound applies to simple general polygons , see @xcite .",
    "both proofs are based on subdividing the polygon into weak visibility subpolygons that are in a certain sense independent with respect to cf - chromatic guarding .",
    "+ for the strong chromatic version we have @xmath19 for simple polygons and @xmath20 even for the monotone orthogonal case , see @xcite .",
    "np - hardness is dicussed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "simple @xmath21 upper bounds are shown for special polygon classes like spiral polygons and orthogonal staircase polygons combined with line visibility .",
    "next we state our main contributions for simple orthogonal polygons :    1 .",
    "we show @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the lower bound holds for line visibility , too : @xmath24 .",
    "this is the first super - constant lower bound for this problem .",
    "3 .   for the strong chromatic version",
    "we have @xmath25 .",
    "the chromatic agp versions can be easily interpreted as hypergraph coloring questions .",
    "smorodinsky @xcite gives a nice survey of both practical and theoretical aspects of hypergraph coloring .",
    "a special role play hypergraphs that arise in geometry .",
    "for example , given a set of points @xmath0 in the plane and a set of regions @xmath26 like rectangles , disks etc .",
    "we can define the hypergraph @xmath27 .",
    "the discrete interval hypergraph @xmath28 is a concrete example of such a hypergraph : we take @xmath5 points on a line and all possible intervals as regions .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath29 . as to our agp versions",
    ", we can associate with a given polygon and a guard set a geometric hypergraph .",
    "its vertices are the guards and a hyperedge is defined by a set of guards that have a nonempty common intersection of their visibility regions and in the intersection there is a point that sees exactly these guards .",
    "then one wants to color this graph in a conflict - free or in a strong manner . +",
    "another example is the following rectangle hypergraph .",
    "vertex set is a finite set of @xmath5 axis - aligned rectangles and each maximal subset of rectangles with a common intersection forms a hyperedge . here",
    "the order for the cf - chromatic number is @xmath30 and @xmath31 as shown in @xcite .",
    "looking at our results , it is not a big surprise that the combination of orthogonal polygons with r - visibility yields the strongest bounds .",
    "this is simply due to additional structural properties and this phenomenon has already been observed for the original agp .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 tight worst case bound for covering simple orthogonal polygons with general stars can also be proven for r - stars ( see @xcite ) and it holds even for orthogonal polygons with holes , see ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , while minimizing the number of guards is np - hard both for simple general and orthogonal polygons if based on line visibility , it becomes polynomially solvable for r - visibility in the simple orthogonal case , see @xcite .",
    "the latter result is based on the solution of the strong perfect graph conjecture .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give neccesary basic definitions in the next section .",
    "then we prove upper bounds in section 3 using techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "our main contribution are the lower bound proofs in section 4 .",
    "especially , we introduce a novel combinatorial structure called multicolor tableau .",
    "this structure enables us to extend the lower bound proof for r - visibility to the line visibility model .",
    "omitted proofs can be found in the appendix .",
    "we study simple orthogonal polygons , i.e. , polygons consisting of alternating vertical and horizontal edges only that do not have holes . by @xmath33 we denote the number of vertices , by @xmath34 the boundary and by @xmath35 the interior of the polygon .",
    "vertices can be reflex or convex .",
    "a reflex vertex has an interior angle @xmath36 while convex vertices have an interior angle of @xmath37 . to simplify the presentation we make the following very weak assumption about general position of orthogonal polygons :",
    "if two reflex vertices @xmath38 are connected in @xmath39 by a horizontal / vertical chord then the four rays emanating from @xmath3 and @xmath7 towards the interior along the incident edges represent only 3 of the 4 main compass directions .",
    "that is , two rays are opposite to each other and the other two point in the same direction .",
    "points @xmath38 are line visible ( or l - visible for short ) to each other if the line segment @xmath40 is containd in @xmath0 .",
    "observe that the segment @xmath40 is allowed to contain parts of boundary edges .",
    "the points @xmath41 are r - visible to each other if the closed axis - parallel rectangle @xmath42 $ ] spanned by the points is contained in @xmath0 . for @xmath2",
    "we denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44\\subseteq p\\}$ ] the set of all points l - visible from @xmath3 and r - visibility , respectively .",
    "this is also called the visibility polygon of a point @xmath2 .",
    "if it is clear from the context which polygon is meant we omit the index .",
    "a polygon that is fully visible from one of its points is called a star and , again , we have to distinguish between l - stars and r - stars .",
    "most notably , for a point @xmath3 in an orthogonal polygon the visibility polygon @xmath45 is itself orthogonal while @xmath46 usually is not .",
    "we can generalize this by defining for a subpolygon @xmath47 its visibility polygon by @xmath48 .",
    "the windows of a subpolygon @xmath49 in @xmath0 are those parts of @xmath50 that do not belong to @xmath34 .    for an orthogonal polygon @xmath0",
    "we define its induced r - visibility line arragement @xmath51 .",
    "two points @xmath38 are equivalent with respect to r - visibility if @xmath52 .",
    "this is an equivalence relation .",
    "what are the equivalence classes ?",
    "first of all , there is a simple geometric construction to find @xmath51 . for each reflex vertex of @xmath0",
    "we extend both incident boundary edges into @xmath39 until they meet the boundary again , therefore defining a subdivision of the polygon .",
    "the faces of this line arrangement are rectangles , line segments , and intersection points .",
    "clearly , two points from the interior of the same rectangle define the same r - star .",
    "what about line segments in the arrangement ?",
    "we extend a line segment @xmath14 into both directions until we hit a convex vertex or the interior of a boundary edge .",
    "let s call this extension @xmath53 . by our general position assumption we know that on one side ( _ inner _ side ) of @xmath53 there is only polygon interior .",
    "consider a point @xmath3 in the interior of a line segment that is incident with two rectangular faces .",
    "it is not difficult to see , that @xmath3 inherits the r - visibility from the incident rectangle on its inner side and the same rule applies to intersection points which can have up to four incident rectangles .",
    "finally , we define special classes of orthogonal polygons . a weak r - visibility polygon ( also known as histogram )",
    "has a boundary edge @xmath54 ( called base edge ) connecting two convex vertices such that @xmath55 .",
    "this is therefore a monotone polygon with respect to the orientation of @xmath54 .",
    "a weak r - visibility polygon that is an r - star is called a _",
    "pyramid_.      a set @xmath12 of points is an r - guard set for an orthogonal polygon @xmath0 if their r - visibility polygons jointly cover the whole polygon .",
    "that is : @xmath56 , analogously for l - visibility .",
    "if in addition each guard @xmath57 is assigned one color @xmath58 from a fixed finite set of colors @xmath59=\\{1,2,\\ldots , t\\}$ ] we have a chromatic guarding @xmath60 .",
    "next we give the central definition of this paper .",
    "a chromatic r - guard set @xmath60 for @xmath0 is strong if for any two guards @xmath61 we have @xmath62 implies @xmath63 .",
    "+ a chromatic r - guard set @xmath60 is conflict - free if for any point @xmath2 in the guard set @xmath64 there is at least one guard with a unique color .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the minimal @xmath1 such that there is conflict - free chromatic guarding set for @xmath0 using @xmath1 colors . maximizing this value over all polygons with @xmath5 vertices from a specified polygon class",
    "is denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "+ consequently , we denote by @xmath67 the minimal @xmath1 such that there is strong chromatic guarding set using @xmath1 colors . maximizing this value for all polygons with @xmath5 vertices from a specified polygon class",
    "defines the value @xmath68 .",
    "+ the notions for line visibility are completely analogous and use superscript @xmath14 .",
    "we show upper bounds for both strong and conflict - free r - guarding of simple orthogonal polygons of size @xmath5 : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these bounds are even realized by r - guards placed in the interior of visibility cells .",
    "this restriction will simplify the arguments .",
    "the proof ( see also @xcite ) follows closely ideas developed in @xcite for conflict - free l - guarding of simple polygons .",
    "therefore we only recall the general ideas , omit some proof details and emphasize the differences stemming from the underlying r - visibility .",
    "first of all , we reuse the central concept of _ independence _ introduced in @xcite for line visibility .",
    "independence means that one can use the same color sets for coloring guards in independent subpolygons .",
    "the following definition suffices for our purposes .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple orthogonal polygon and @xmath71 and @xmath72 subpolygons of @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath71 and @xmath72 independent if @xmath73 .",
    "next , we are going to subdivide hierarchically an orthogonal polygon @xmath0 into weak visibility subpolygons by a standard window partitioning process as described in @xcite .",
    "+ remark : in the following we use the term subdivision not in the strong set - theoretic sense .",
    "a subdivision of @xmath0 into closed subpolygons @xmath74 means that @xmath75 and for all @xmath76 we have @xmath77 .",
    "+ the subdivision is represented by a tree @xmath78 with the weak visibility polygons as node set .",
    "let @xmath54 be a highest horizontal edge of @xmath34 , the `` starting '' window .",
    "@xmath79 is a weak visibility polygon and is the root vertex of @xmath80 .",
    "now @xmath81 splits @xmath0 into parts and defines a finite set ( possibly empty if @xmath82 ) of vertical windows @xmath83 .",
    "each window corresponds to a left or right turn of a shortest orthogonal path from @xmath54 to the subpolygon lying entirely behind the window .",
    "then we recurse , see figure [ partitionfigures ] . + by the partitioning process we can obtain a linear number of subpolygons only .",
    "there are @xmath84 reflex vertices in a simple orthogonal polygon with @xmath5 vertices .",
    "each window uses at least one reflex vertex .",
    "therefore , we get at most @xmath85 weak visibility polygons .",
    "this bound is realized for example by spiral polygons .",
    "let @xmath86 be the family of all weak visibility polygons corresponding to nodes of depth congruent @xmath87 in @xmath80 .",
    "we partition @xmath88 into @xmath89 consisting of @xmath81 and all those subpolygons which are left children and , on the other side , @xmath90 consisting of the remaining `` right '' parts .    [ indep ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a polygon and @xmath91 the family of subpolygons corresponding to left nodes in @xmath80 with depth congruent @xmath92 .",
    "then the interior of subpolygons in @xmath93 have pairwise link distance at least three , analogously for @xmath94 .",
    "suppose there are two different subpolygons @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xmath93 .",
    "if they have different depth then for arbitrary points @xmath95 and @xmath96 any orthogonal path connecting these points has length at least 3 .",
    "otherwise they have the same depth . in this case",
    "they could be sibling nodes with parent node @xmath97 .",
    "to walk orthogonally from @xmath98 to @xmath99 it needs two parallel edges to cross the windows plus one more edge in @xmath97 .",
    "if the lowest common ancestor @xmath97 is more than 1 level above then a shortest orthogonal path from @xmath98 to @xmath99 has to visit the parent node of @xmath71 , the parent node of @xmath72 and then descend to @xmath99 which takes at least three edges .    observe that distinguishing left and right nodes is essential .",
    "it can be possible to walk with one step from a left node to a right sibling .",
    "let @xmath100 be subpolygons computed in the subdivision process for @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent and there exists a strong chromatic r - guarding for @xmath0 in which guards in @xmath71 and @xmath72 use the same color set .",
    "the same is true for conflict - free chromatic guarding .",
    "assume we have r - guards @xmath101 in @xmath102 , @xmath103 with @xmath104 containing a point @xmath7 . then there",
    "exist points @xmath105\\cap",
    "( \\mbox{int } p_1 )   , p_2'\\in r[p_2,q]\\cap ( \\mbox{int } p_2)$ ] and a connecting orthogonal path @xmath106 of length 2 .",
    "but this contradicts the previous lemma .",
    "therefore @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent and strong chromatic r - guardings for @xmath71 and @xmath72 do not interfere with each other , the same holds for conflict - free r - guardings .",
    "remark : we will restrict the guards to sit in the interior of visibility cells . however , this does not effect the asymptotic upper bounds on the number of colors used .",
    "consider a weak visibility polygon @xmath0 with a horizontal base edge @xmath54 .",
    "an edge of @xmath0 opposite to @xmath54 is an @xmath15-edge if it connects two reflex vertices , it is a @xmath107-edge if it has two convex vertices . among the horizontal edges opposite to @xmath54",
    "there is at least one @xmath107-edge and a chain connecting two consecutive @xmath107-edges contains exactly one @xmath15 edge .",
    "recall that a pyramid @xmath0 contains exactly one @xmath107-edge @xmath108 .",
    "we guard a pyramid with one r - guard stationed opposite to @xmath108 in the visibility cell just below base edge @xmath54 .",
    "next we describe ( see @xcite ) a simple truncation process that decomposes a weak visibility problem into pyramids .    *",
    "the truncation process : * let @xmath0 be a weak visibility polygon with @xmath5 vertices , a horizontal base edge @xmath54 on top of the polygon and @xmath109 the set of @xmath107-edges opposite to @xmath54 . if there is only one such @xmath107-edge we stop and return @xmath0",
    "otherwise , for each @xmath107-edge @xmath110 we sweep @xmath0 from @xmath110 towards @xmath54 until the sweep line reaches the first neighboring @xmath15-edge .",
    "we truncate @xmath0 by cutting of the pyramid below . after processing all edges in @xmath109",
    "we have again a weak visibility polygon @xmath111 with base edge @xmath54 .",
    "observe that @xmath111 does not depend on the order in which we process the edges in @xmath109 and , moreover , the pyramids associated with @xmath109 are independent .",
    "+ then we iterate with @xmath111 and get @xmath112 and so on . eventually , we have indeed partitioned @xmath0 completely into pyramids .",
    "these pyramids have an important structural property . by construction ,",
    "the unique @xmath107-edge in each pyramid contains a non - empty segment of the original boundary @xmath34 , we call them `` solid '' segments . as guard position for such a pyramid we choose an interior point just below the base edge of the pyramid opposite to an interior point of a solid segment .    in figure [ covguards ]",
    "we see an example of a weak visibility polygon , its decomposition into pyramids and the chosen guard positions .",
    "again , there is a canonical schematic tree representing the decomposition and the guard positons .",
    "clearly , the height of @xmath113 is in @xmath114 . in the worst case",
    ", this is best possible as shown by the spike polygons @xmath115 in section 4 we use for our lower bound proofs .",
    "the following lemma states the main structural property for this tree of guards .",
    "[ chain ] let @xmath0 be a weak visibility polygon and @xmath116 the guard - tree computed in the truncation process .",

    "assume two nodes representing pyramids @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not on a root to leaf path in @xmath116 .",
    "consider the lowest common anchestor node , say it is pyramid @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath97 has a solid segment in its c - edge .",
    "therefore @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent and r - guards from both pyramids can not see the same point @xmath3 .",
    "now we know that all r - guards watching a common point @xmath3 are indeed on a common root - to - leaf path .",
    "let @xmath117 be the deepest and @xmath118 the highest guard among them with @xmath119 .",
    "we have to show , that all guards in between see point @xmath3 , too .",
    "where can point @xmath3 be ?",
    "it has to be in the vertical strip above the base line of the pyramid with guard @xmath117 and below the base line of the pyramid corresponding to @xmath118 , since the parent node of @xmath118 does not see @xmath3 by assumption .",
    "this region is a rectangle @xmath120 . for any guard @xmath121 between @xmath117 and @xmath118",
