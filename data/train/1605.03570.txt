    "pme is a nontrivial generalization of the heat equation .",
    "it is found in many areas of the physical sciences , including gas flow in porous medium , incompressible fluid dynamics , nonlinear heat transfer , and image processing ; e.g. , see @xcite and references therein . in the case of gas flow in porous medium",
    ", @xmath4 represents the density of the gas , @xmath5 the pressure , @xmath6 the flux , @xmath7 the velocity , and @xmath8 is the isentropic coefficient . in the case of radiation diffusion in plasmas , @xmath8 stands for the power of temperature appearing in the nonlinear diffusion coefficient and can take values up to 5.5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 23 ) . pme itself represents a nonlinear diffusion process .",
    "one of its many interesting features is its degeneracy which induces a property of the finite propagation : if @xmath2 has a compact support , the solution will have a compact support for any time @xmath9 .",
    "this in effect creates a free boundary that stays between the regions where @xmath4 is nonzero and where @xmath4 vanishes and propagates at a finite speed for all time .",
    "contrary to the heat equation which smooths out its initial solutions , pme solution can become nonsmooth even in cases where it has a smooth initial solution .",
    "moreover , for a certain type of initial solutions , the solution can exhibit a waiting - time phenomenon for which the free boundary will not move until a finite amount of time has elapsed .",
    "pme has been studied extensively in theory and there is a vast literature , including the earlier work by olenik et al .",
    "@xcite , kalanikov @xcite , aronson @xcite , the more recent work by shmarev @xcite , and the monograph by vzquez @xcite and references therein .",
    "the numerical solution of pme has also received considerable attention from researchers .",
    "particularly , error estimates have been obtained for various finite element approximations .",
    "for example , using a regularization approach ( to avoid degenerate or negative diffusion , for instance , with the diffusion coefficient @xmath10 being replaced by @xmath11 for some regularization parameter @xmath12 ) and taking @xmath13 , rose @xcite shows that the error for a p1 finite element ( for space )  backward euler ( for time ) approximation of pme is bounded by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the maximum element diameter and @xmath16 is the numerical approximation of @xmath4 at @xmath17 .",
    "nochetto and verdi @xcite consider a class of degenerate pdes which includes pme as a special example and improve the result of @xcite .",
    "they show that the error for a p1 finite element ",
    "1st - order semi - implicit approximation of pme is bounded by @xmath18 for the p1 finite element ",
    "backward euler approximation , error bounds in various norm are obtained , for instance , @xmath19 by rulla and walkington @xcite , @xmath20 by ebmeyer @xcite , and @xmath21 by wei and lefton @xcite , where @xmath22 is the space dimension .",
    "it is remarked that these estimates are obtained for quasi - uniform meshes .",
    "the convergence rate is first order at best and decreases with @xmath8 .",
    "some of these estimates are shown to be optimal in the corresponding norm in lieu of the known regularity of the solution of pme .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that ebmeyer and liu @xcite obtain error estimates in quasi - norm and emmrich and ika @xcite prove that a galerkin finite element ",
    "backward euler approximation converges to the weak solution of pme using the theory of monotone operators .",
    "more recently , duque et al .",
    "@xcite establish @xmath23 error bounds for the approximation of a general order continuous galerkin in space and a general order discontinuous galerkin in time for pme with a variable exponent @xmath24 .",
    "zhang and wu @xcite consider the numerical simulation of the one - dimensional pme on a uniform mesh using a high - order local discontinuous galerkin finite element method .",
    "the method can effectively eliminate unwanted , nonphysical oscillations in the computed solution near the free boundary and lead to a high - order convergence rate within the solution support and away from the free boundary .",
    "the low regularity ( steep gradient and corner shape near the moving free boundary ) and evolving nature of the solution makes adaptive moving mesh methods an attractive tool to improve accuracy in the numerical solution of pme .",
    "a number of works exist in this direction .",
    "for example , budd et al .",
    "@xcite investigate the numerical simulation of self - similarity solutions of one - dimensional pme using the moving mesh pde ( mmpde ) moving mesh method @xcite and a specially designed monitor function to preserve the scaling invariance of pme . in a series of papers @xcite",
    "( also see the review paper @xcite ) , baines and his co - workers study the numerical solution of pme in one and two dimensions using a moving mesh finite element method that is based upon conserving a local proportion of the total mass that is present in the projected initial data .",
    "numerical results show that their method gives a second - order convergence for @xmath25 but only a first - order convergence for @xmath26 when a uniform initial mesh is used @xcite . for @xmath26",
    ", the second - order convergence can be recovered in one dimension if an optimal initial mesh is used .",
    "unfortunately , such an optimal mesh is significantly more expensive to compute in two dimensions than in one dimension .",
    "recently , duque et al .",
    "@xcite present a moving mesh finite element method based on an mmpde for pme with variable exponents and with / without absorption .",
    "the method shows a first - order convergence when tested for the barenblatt - pattle solution of pme .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study an adaptive moving mesh finite element method for the numerical solution of pme .",
    "the method is also based on an mmpde but significantly different from the method of @xcite .",
    "the mmpde we use is formulated by minimizing an energy ( cf .",
    "( [ ih ] ) ) based on the equidistribution and alignment conditions and the mesh adaptation is controlled through a matrix - valued function ( i.e. , a metric tensor ) instead of a scalar function .",
    "the advantage of using a metric tensor is that it provides information not only to control the size of mesh elements but also their shape and orientation . generally speaking",
    ", a so generated mesh has better alignment with the geometry of the physical solution than that with a scalar mesh adaptation function .",
    "moreover , a newly developed compact formulation of the method ( cf .",
    "( [ mmpde-2 ] ) and ( [ mmpde-3 ] ) ) makes its implementation much easier and more efficient .",
    "mesh adaptation based on the gradient and hessian of the solution will be considered .",
    "the arclength metric tensor ( a gradient - based metric tensor ) has been widely used in the context of moving mesh methods because it results in more stable mesh movement than a hessian - based metric tensor and works well for many problems . on the other hand",
    ", there is no theoretical guarantee that the arclength metric tensor will lead to the optimal convergence order for piecewise linear interpolation or finite element approximation since the error is determined by the hessian of the solution in these situations . as a matter of fact , there are problems , although not very common , for which we have to use a hessian - based metric tensor in order to achieve the optimal convergence order for piecewise linear interpolation or finite element approximation .",
    "interestingly , pme is one of those problems .",
    "we shall show that the linear finite element approximation of the barenblatt - pattle solution of pme shows a first - order convergence for arclength - based adaptive meshes and a second - order convergence for hessian - based adaptive meshes .",
    "another feature of the method that is different from those of duque et al .",
    "@xcite and baines et al .",
    "@xcite is that pme is solved on a large domain that contains the free boundary for the whole time period under consideration . in this way , there is no need to explicitly trace the movement of the free boundary and thus the method can readily deal with more complicated structures in the solution and in the differential equation .",
    "numerical examples with simple free boundary ( such as the barenblatt - pattle solution ) and more complex and even merging free boundaries will be presented as well as those for pme with variable exponents and absorption .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned mmpde method , a number of other moving mesh methods have been developed in the past ; e.g. , see hirt et al .",
    "@xcite ( ale  arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ) miller and miller @xcite ( mfe  moving finite element ) , liao and anderson @xcite ( deformation map ) , li et al .",
    "@xcite ( mesh rezoning ) , cao et al .",
    "@xcite ( geometric conservation law ) , baines et al .",
    "@xcite ( conservation of fraction mass ) , and budd and williams @xcite ( parabolic monge - ampre equation ) .",
    "the interested reader is also referred to the books / review articles @xcite and references therein .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "some properties of pme that are relevant to the numerical simulation are described in section  [ sec : pme - theory ] .",
    "section  [ sec : mmfem ] is devoted to the description of the moving mesh finite element method , including the linear finite element discretion of pme on a moving mesh and the generation of an adaptive moving mesh using the mmpde approach .",
    "numerical examples are presented in sections  [ sec : pme - numerics ] and [ sec : pme - numerics-2 ] for pme and pme with variable exponents and absorption , respectively .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusions and further comments .",
    "before we describe the finite element approximation of ibvp ( [ pme-1 ] ) , it is instructive to recall some of its properties that are relevant to numerical simulation . first of all , it is known ( e.g. , see vzquez @xcite ) that when @xmath27 , ibvp has a weak solution @xmath4 satisfying @xmath28 for any @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , a nonnegative weak solution exists if @xmath27 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the uniqueness of the weak solution is guaranteed if it is further assumed that @xmath33 .",
    "pme is degenerate whenever @xmath34 . due to this degeneracy",
    ", pde has the property of the finite speed of propagation : if compact - supported initially , its solution remains compact - supported at any finite time , with the support monotonically expanding as time evolves .",
    "the boundary of the support forms a moving interface @xmath35 which is commonly referred to as a free boundary . the velocity of the free boundary is given by darcy s law ( e.g. , see shmarev @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath36 where the limit is taken from the interior of the support .",
    "in addition , pme exhibits a waiting - time phenomenon : for a certain type of initial solutions the free boundary does not move until a finite amount of time has elapsed . loosely speaking , from ( [ darcy - law ] )",
    "we may expect to see this phenomenon for initial solutions having vanishing @xmath7 at the initial free boundary .",
    "a few classes of special solutions to ibvp have been known , among which is the barenblatt - pattle solution , viz .",
    ", @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a given parameter .",
    "it is radially symmetric , self - similar , and compact - supported for any finite time .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is lipschitz continuous in @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 is bounded in the support of @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the solution is hlder continuous .",
    "the slope of the solution at the free boundary is finite for @xmath45 and becomes infinite when @xmath46 , which causes challenges for the numerical solution of pme .",
    "these regularity properties also hold for general compactly supported solutions of ( [ pme-1 ] ) , and their free boundaries can be shown to be at least lipschitz continuous in both space and time ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the adaptive moving mesh finite element approximation of ibvp  . to begin with",
    ", we note that there are roughly two approaches for solving the ibvp .",
    "the first , as used in @xcite , is to solve pme in a large domain containing the free boundary for the whole time period of the simulation . with this approach",
    ", there is no need to explicitly treat the free boundary , which makes the approach more amenable to problems with complex solution supports .",
    "the main disadvantage of this approach is that the solution has a corner shape between the regions of zero and nonzero solution values and thus its regularity on the whole domain is at most @xmath47 .",
    "an @xmath47 regularity often means at best a first - order convergence in the numerical solution as the mesh is refined .",
    "the second approach is to solve the problem only in the region of compact support ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that a smaller spatial domain is used and thus fewer mesh points can be used to achieve the same computational accuracy .",
    "moreover , the regularity of the solution is better on the support than on a larger domain since it does not have a corner shape . as a result",
    ", the numerical solution can have a higher convergence order than that with the first approach .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the boundary movement has to be treated explicitly using darcy s law ( [ darcy - law ] ) .",
    "we use the first approach in this work .",
    "we choose this approach due to its advantage of no need to explicitly treat the free boundary and its potential to deal with problems having complex solution supports . to better resolve the corner shape in the solution and improve the computational accuracy",
    ", we employ an mmpde - based moving mesh method @xcite to adaptively and dynamically concentrate the mesh points around the free boundary .",
    "linear finite elements and the fifth - order radau iia method ( e.g. , see hairer and wanner @xcite ) are used for the spatial and temporal discretization , respectively .",
    "as we will see in section  [ sec : pme - numerics ] , a second - order convergence of the finite element approximation in space can be achieved when a properly adapted mesh is used .",
    "we now describe the finite element discretization .",
    "denote the time instants by @xmath48 for the moment , we assume that the simplicial meshes @xmath49 , @xmath50 for the physical domain @xmath1 at these time instants are known and have the same connectivity and the same numbers of vertices and elements .",
    "( their generation will be discussed in the next subsection . )",
    "denote the coordinates of the vertices of @xmath49 by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of all vertices .",
    "the mesh @xmath54 between any two time instants @xmath55 and @xmath56 is defined through linear interpolation , i.e. , @xmath57 denote by @xmath58 the linear basis function associated with vertex @xmath59 . for convenience , we assume that the vertices are arranged such that the first @xmath60 vertices are the interior vertices .",
    "let @xmath61 then , the linear finite element approximation to the solution of ibvp is defined as @xmath62 , @xmath63 $ ] such that @xmath64 the above equation can be cast in matrix form . indeed , expressing @xmath65 and differentiating it with respect to @xmath41 ,",
    "we have @xmath66 it can be shown ( e.g. see jimack and wathen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) ) that @xmath67 where the mesh velocity @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 then , we get @xmath70 from this and taking @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) in ( [ fem0 ] ) successively , we obtain @xmath73 which can be cast in the matrix form as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mass matrix and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the vectors representing the mesh and solution , respectively .",
    "this ode system is integrated from @xmath55 to @xmath78 using the fifth - order radau iia method , with @xmath79 being determined by a standard time step size selection procedure ( e.g. , see hairer et al .",
    "* section ii.4 ) ) and using a two - step error estimator of gonzalez - pinto et al .",
    "the relative and absolute tolerances @xmath80 and @xmath81 are taken in the computation .    the whole computation alternates between the integration of pme and the generation of the mesh .",
    "starting with the current mesh @xmath49 and a solution @xmath82 defined thereon , a new mesh @xmath83 is generated using the moving mesh strategy to be described in the next subsection .",
    "then , the discrete pme ( [ fem-2 ] ) is integrated from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( as described above ) to obtain the solution approximation @xmath84 .",
    "we now describe the generation of @xmath49 , @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that the mesh @xmath49 and a computed solution @xmath86 are known at @xmath87 .",

    "@xmath89 stays fixed for the whole computation .",
    "the generation of @xmath83 is through the computational mesh @xmath90 which serves as an intermediate variable .",

    "the system is integrated and the mesh @xmath97 is obtained . during the integration , both @xmath95 and @xmath49",
    "are kept fixed .",
    "notice that @xmath91 and @xmath49 form a correspondence relation , say , @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "then , the vertices of the new physical mesh @xmath83 are defined as @xmath100 . since",
    "@xmath101 is defined only at the vertices of @xmath91 , we need to compute @xmath102 using interpolation .",
    "linear interpolation is used since it is important to keep the nonsingularity of the mesh while it is unnecessary to compute the mesh to high accuracy .",
    "the metric tensor is assumed to be symmetric and uniformly positive definite on @xmath1 .",
    "it is used to control the size , shape , and orientation of the elements of the mesh to be generated .",
    "we consider three types of mesh , one is uniform and the other two are arclength- and hessian - based adaptive meshes .",
    "the metric tensors associated with the adaptive meshes are defined as @xmath103^{-\\frac{1}{6 } }                  \\left ( \\mathbb{i } +   |h(u_h^n)|\\right ) ,   \\label{m - hessian }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the @xmath105 identity matrix , @xmath106 is a recovered hessian for the piecewise linear finite element solution @xmath16 , and @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the eigen - decomposition of @xmath106 .",
    "the tensor ( [ m - arclength ] ) is the frequently used arclength monitor function which , loosely speaking , places mesh points according to the uniformity in arclength .",
    "the tensor ( [ m - hessian ] ) is optimal @xcite for the @xmath109 norm of linear interpolation error . in our computation , we use a least squares fitting strategy for hessian recovery ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we now describe the formulation of the mmpde - based mesh equation .",
    "a key component of the formulation is the @xmath95-uniform mesh concept with which any ( nonuniform ) adaptive mesh is viewed as a uniform one in some metric .",
    "it is known @xcite that such an @xmath95-uniform mesh @xmath110 approximately satisfies the equidistribution and alignment conditions @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the volume of @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the average of @xmath95 over @xmath113 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote the determinant and trace of a matrix , respectively , @xmath117 is the volume of the element @xmath118 corresponding to @xmath113 , @xmath119 is the jacobian matrix of the affine mapping @xmath120 , and @xmath121 ) requires that the volume of @xmath113 in the metric @xmath95 be proportional to @xmath117 with constant proportionality while the alignment condition ( [ ali-1 ] ) requires that @xmath113 be similar to @xmath122 .",
    "the meshes that closely satisfy these conditions can be obtained by minimizing the energy function @xmath123 which is a riemann sum of a continuous functional developed in @xcite based on equidistribution and alignment for variational mesh adaptation . here ,",

    "in the previous sections we have studied an adaptive moving mesh finite element method for the numerical solution of pme . the method is based on the mmpde moving mesh strategy and its new implementation and uses a linear finite element method and the fifth - order radau iia scheme for the spatial and temporal discretization .",

    "three types of mesh have been considered , uniform and acrlength- and hessian - based adaptive meshes .",
    "the method shows a first - order convergence behavior as the mesh is refined for uniform and arclength - based adaptive meshes and improves to a second - order convergence when hessian - based adaptive meshes are used .",
    "this indicates that mesh concentration around the free boundary is important to the accuracy of the method .",

    "we have also studied the application of the method to pme with variable exponents and absorption for which there are very few theoretical results available .",
