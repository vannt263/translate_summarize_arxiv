    "the existence of complete non flat minimal surfaces with bounded coordinate functions , has been the instigator of many interesting articles on the theory of minimal surfaces in @xmath4 and @xmath3 over the last few decades .",
    "the question of whether there exists a complete bounded complex submanifold in @xmath6 was proposed by p. yang in @xcite and answered by p. jones in @xcite where this author present a short and elegant method to construct bounded ( embedded ) complex curves @xmath7 , where @xmath8 means the open unit disc of the complex plane .",
    "although these curves are minimal in @xmath3 ( they are holomorphic ) , their respective projections @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not minimal in @xmath4 .",
    "if we pursue this , we need to impose that the complex curve @xmath7 also satisfies @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the derivative with respect to the complex coordinate on @xmath8 . from now on , curves of this kind",
    "will be called _ holomorphic null curves .",
    "_    the previous question is closely related to an earlier question by e. calabi , who asked in 1965 @xcite whether or not it is possible for a complete minimal surface in @xmath4 to be contained in a ball in @xmath4 .",
    "two articles , in particular , have made very important , if not fundamental , contributions to this problem .",
    "the first one was by l. p. jorge and f. xavier @xcite , who constructed examples of complete minimal surfaces in a slab .",
    "the second one was by n. nadirashvili @xcite , who more recently produced examples contained in a ball . in both cases ,",
    "the key step was the ingenious use of runge s classical theorem .    in respect",
    "to complete bounded minimal null curves in @xmath6 , the existence of such curves has been an open problem for @xmath13 . for the case",
    "@xmath14 , j. bourgain @xcite proves that these curves can not exist .",
    "moreover , jones in @xcite proved that for @xmath15 it is possible to construct complete bounded null curves in @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we give a positive solution to the existence of complete bounded null curves in @xmath3 and obtain some interesting consequences .",
    "to be more precise , we prove the following theorem :    [ thm : a ] there is a complete holomorphic null immersion @xmath16 whose image is bounded . in particular , there is a complete bounded ( immersed ) minimal surface in @xmath4 such that its conjugate minimal surface is also bounded .    here",
    ", we denote by @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) the open ( resp",
    ".  closed ) ball in @xmath19 of radius @xmath20 centered at @xmath21 .",

    "we remark that the existence of complete bounded complex submanifolds in @xmath3 has been shown in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : a ] is equivalent to the existence of complete bounded null curves in @xmath2 , and also equivalent to complete bounded mean curvature @xmath24 surfaces ( i.e. cmc-1 surface ) in the hyperbolic @xmath0-space @xmath1 . here",
    "a holomorphic map @xmath25 from a riemann surface @xmath26 to the complex lie group @xmath2 is called _ null _ if the determinant @xmath27 of @xmath28 vanishes , that is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a complex coordinate of @xmath26 .",
    "a projection @xmath31 of a null holomorphic curve is a cmc-1 surface in @xmath1 , where @xmath32 is the projection , see in section  [ subsec : sl2c ] .",

    "recently , alarcon @xcite constructed a space - like maximal surface bounded by a hyperboloid in @xmath44 , which is weakly complete in the sense of @xcite but may not be bounded .",
    "it should be remarked that our bounded null curve in @xmath3 in theorem  [ thm : a ] induces a bounded maximal surface in @xmath44 as a refinement of alarcon s result :    [ cor : maxface ] there are a weakly complete space - like maximal surface in @xmath44 and a weakly complete space - like @xmath46-@xmath24 surface in @xmath45 whose image are bounded .",
    "the definition of weak completeness for maximal surfaces and for cmc-@xmath24 surfaces ( with singularities ) are mentioned in the proof in section  [ subsec : proofmaxface ] .",
    "our procedure to prove theorem  [ thm : c ] is similar in style to that used by nadirashvili in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more general construction ) .",
    "however , we have to improve the techniques because nadirashvili s method does not allow us to control the imaginary part of the resulting minimal immersion . in order to do this",
    ", we work on a cmc-1 surface in hyperbolic 3-space @xmath1 instead of a minimal surface in euclidean 3-space . on each step of construction",
    ", we will apply runge approximation for very small region of the surface , and so we can treat such a small part of the cmc-1 surface like as minimal surface in the euclidean 3-space , which is the first crucial point",
    ". we shall give an error estimation between minimal surface and the cmc-1 surface by using the well - known ode - technique ( see [ subsec : est - ode ] in appendix  [ app : norm ] ) .",
    "next , we will lift the resulting bounded cmc-1 surface into a null curve @xmath2 . since @xmath1 is a quotient of @xmath2 by @xmath47 , the compactness of @xmath47 yields the boundedness of the lifted null curve associated with the bounded cmc-1 surface .",
    "finally , using a transformation between null curves in @xmath3 and null curves in @xmath2 , we can get a complete bounded null immersed curve in @xmath3 from the one in @xmath2 .",
