    "triangle singularities in physical processes were introduced by landau @xcite and stem from feynman diagrams involving three intermediate particles when the three particles can be placed simultaneously on shell and the momenta of these particles are collinear ( parallel or antiparallel ) in the frame of an external decaying particle at rest . in one of the cases ( we call it parallel ) , two of the particles in the loop will go in the same direction and might fuse into other external outgoing particle(s )  @xcite , so that the rescattering process can even happen as a classical process . in this case",
    ", the decay amplitude has a singularity close to the physical region and , thus , can produce an enhancement .",
    "one of the classical cases would be given when the two on shell particles move in the same direction and with similar velocities .",
    "in the center - of - mass frame of the rescattering particles , these two particles would also be at rest and the triangle singularity is then located around the threshold .",
    "one very successful example of effects of the triangle singularity was shown in the decay of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in refs .",
    "the second reaction breaks isospin symmetry .",
    "however , the process @xmath18 followed by @xmath19 and the fusion of @xmath20 enhances drastically the rate of @xmath21 relative to other isospin violating processes .",
    "experimentally the ratio of rates for @xmath22 and @xmath23 is measured to be @xmath24  @xcite , a huge number for an isospin breaking magnitude .",
    "the work of @xcite was continued in @xcite where the precise rates , as well as the shapes of the two reactions , are well described .",
    "another striking example of triangle singularities is the one discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where an interpretation for the ",
    "@xmath25 `` peak seen by the compass collaboration  @xcite is given in terms of a decay of the @xmath26 into @xmath27 , followed by @xmath28 and fusion of @xmath20 , with @xmath29 being the decay channel where the ' ' @xmath25 \" peak is observed .",
    "a recent discussion of the effects of triangle singularities on other reactions in hadron physics can be found in refs .",

    ", the possibility that the narrow peak observed at 4.45  gev might be due to a triangle singularity was immediately noted  @xcite .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration has reanalyzed  @xcite the data of the @xmath31 decay  @xcite and found them consistent with the states reported in @xcite . the possibility that this is due to another triangle singularity is discussed in ref .  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is pointed out that the location of the @xmath32 structure coincides with the @xmath33 threshold and , more importantly , with the leading landau singularity of the triangle diagram with the @xmath34 , @xmath2 and proton in the intermediate state .",
    "such a diagram represents the following processes : the @xmath35 is followed by the decay of @xmath36 and the proton , then , rescatters with the @xmath2 into the @xmath37 in the region where the invariant mass distribution shows up as a narrow sharp peak , which might cause a resonance - like structure as the @xmath32 .",
    "however , the fact that one finds a singularity at a certain energy does not mean that one should see a peak in the reaction .",
    "the location of a triangle singularity is purely kinematic , yet the strength is controlled by dynamics as reflected by the coupling strengths of all of the three vertices involved . in this sense , the cases in the light meson sector discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite are nice examples of clearly showing the enhancement due to triangle singularities , since all involved couplings are relatively well known . in the case of the @xmath38 , neither the weak decay rate of @xmath39 nor the rescattering strength for @xmath40 is known and , thus , it is difficult to assert the importance of the triangle singularities .",
    "however , it is also obvious that triangle singularities need to be taken into account , unless the strength is so small that they can be safely neglected . at this point , we want to emphasize that the purpose of refs .",
    "@xcite is not to show that the @xmath32 structure is due to triangle singularities instead of hadronic resonances , but to show that there exist such singularities around @xmath41  gev , and their consequences need to be carefully explored .    in the present paper",
    "we shall make an exhaustive study of possible triangle singularities involving various @xmath1 and charmonium intermediate states in the range of the @xmath42 invariant mass in the @xmath43 reaction .",
    "there can be many combinations of a @xmath1 hyperon and a charmonium in the triangle diagram .",
    "however , as we shall see , since the condition for a triangle singularity to show up as a prominent enhancement in the relevant invariant mass distribution is rather strict ( for recent discussions , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , only a few of them deserve special attention , and the one discussed in ref .",

    "the triangle singularities can be easily obtained by solving the landau equation  @xcite , as done in , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . whether the solutions are located on the physical boundary , i.e. , whether they can produce a prominent effect on the amplitude in the physically allowed region , is determined by the coleman ",
    "norton theorem  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that after fixing the masses of the proton and charmonium in the cases under consideration , only when the @xmath1 mass is located in a small range there is a triangle singularity on the physical boundary . since the mass region is small , the singularity is also close to the @xmath1charmonium threshold ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . rather than using the landau equation to get the singularities of the amplitude for the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] , we find instructive to perform the loop integration of the three propagators explicitly .",

    "we immediately observe that the poles of the propagators correspond to having pairs of intermediate particles on shell .",
    "the conditions for all the three intermediate particles to be on shell are @xmath61 the other propagators do not lead to singularities , since a @xmath62 can not decay into a @xmath50 and a @xmath45 and @xmath63 is always larger than @xmath64 , and we thus have dropped the corresponding @xmath65 .    from eqs .",
    "and we obtain @xmath66 where we have defined @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , we have from energy conservation for the process @xmath68 with @xmath69 with an invariant mass @xmath70 , @xmath71    then eq . ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) leads immediately to @xmath72 which is the equation providing the singularities of the integrand of the loop integral in eq .  .",
    "however , a singularity of the integrand is not necessarily the singularity of the integral .",
    "if we can deform the integration contour in the complex plane to avoid the singularity , the integral would be regular . in the following two cases",

    "the two factors in the denominator of the integrand of @xmath84 correspond to the two cuts depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] . the cut crossing particles 1 and 2 provides a pole of the integrand of @xmath84 given by @xmath87 which is just eq .   by identifying @xmath88 and @xmath89",

    "the location of the triangle singularity in the variable @xmath70 is found by solving the above equation .",
    "it could also happen that both @xmath120 and @xmath117 pinch the integration path with @xmath118 at the same time , and then the triangle singularity coincides with the normal threshold at @xmath121 . yet , although this requires a very special kinematic configuration , it does happen at @xmath125  gev for the @xmath34@xmath2proton diagram contribution to the @xmath126 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the kinematic region where the triangle singularity can occur .",

    "another condition for @xmath118 to be relevant becomes clear by checking the expression of @xmath118 in eq .  , which is the lorentz boost of the momentum of particle-2 from the center - of - mass frame of the ( 2,3 ) system to the rest frame of the decaying particle .",
    "the negative sign in front of @xmath104 in eq .",
    "means that the direction of motion of particle-2 in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath106 system is opposite to the one in the rest frame of the decaying particle , while the direction of motion of particle-3 is the same in both reference frames .",
    "this implies that particle-3 moves faster than particle-2 in the latter reference frame .",
    "therefore , the triangle singularity happens only when particle-3 moves along the same direction as particle-2 , and has a larger velocity in the rest frame of the decaying particle .",

    "the condition for @xmath140 is @xmath147 , i.e. , the magnitude of velocity of particle-2 in the ( 2,3 ) center - of - mass frame ( which is equal to the one for particle-3 ) is larger than the velocity of the @xmath106 system in the rest frame of the initial particle .",
    "it implies that particle-2 and particle-3 move in opposite directions in the latter frame and thus particle-3 , emitted from the decay of particle-1 , which moves also opposite to particle-2 in the rest frame of the initial particle , can not rescatter with particle-2 in a classical picture with energy - momentum conservation , in accordance with the conclusion of ref .",
    "now let us turn to the problem of possible triangle singularities contributing to the @xmath148 from triangle diagrams with a @xmath1 hyperon , a charmonium and a proton as the intermediate states .",

    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we can see that , in the case of @xmath8 for the @xmath206 final states and @xmath233 , which requires a @xmath10-wave , the amplitude is very much suppressed with respect to the case where one has the @xmath234 in @xmath6-wave .",
    "this is natural since the singularity appears when putting the @xmath235 on shell and at threshold , where the @xmath10-wave factor vanishes .",
    "we can see that the strength at the peak is about 20 times smaller than the one in the @xmath6-wave case .",
    "we also see that the @xmath6-wave structure is very much peaked and narrow , while the one of the @xmath10-wave has a  background \" below the peak , accumulating more strength than the peak .",
    "also the shape is too broad to associate it to the observed narrow pentaquark in the experiment .",
    "there is another factor to take into account . in this case",
    "the contribution of the @xmath236 , which proceeds via an @xmath6-wave , would give us a narrow peak around 4624  mev , much stronger than the one provided by the @xmath10-wave @xmath233 , assuming the rescattering strengths are comparable .",
    "an inspection of the experimental data shows that the @xmath208 invariant mass distribution in this region is flat .",
    "these arguments lead to the conclusion that , if the narrow @xmath206 structure has quantum numbers @xmath8 , one of the choices in the experimental analysis , the triangle singularities due to @xmath237 intermediate states can not play an important role in the decay @xmath238 .",
    "the other quantum numbers preferred in the current experimental analysis for the narrow state are @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", one needs a @xmath11-wave in @xmath239 and the situation is worse . we have checked that numerically but there is no need to discuss it .",
    "we pass now to discuss the possibility that the @xmath206 system in the narrow structure takes the quantum numbers @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "in this case the @xmath240 amplitude proceeds via an @xmath6-wave and we would have the situation shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : new3 ] .",
    "the peak is narrow enough and located at the right position .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath15 triangle diagram reinforces by merging the triangle singularity with the normal @xmath211 threshold at 4.45  gev , which makes the peak more prominent than in the other cases .",
    "this was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , which tried to draw attention to the complications of interpreting the @xmath32 . is due to the triangle singularity . on the contrary ,",
    "a method discriminating the true resonance explanation from the @xmath15 triangle singularity was proposed . ] in this case , the contribution from the @xmath3 intermediate state would proceed with @xmath236 in a @xmath10-wave and would be drastically reduced with respect to the one shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : swavepsi ] .",
    "we have analyzed in detail when the singularities of the triangle amplitude appear with a different formalism than the one normally used , which allows for a complementary understanding of their origin , as well as for an easy evaluation of the singularities .",
    "they are generated by a genuine triangle singularity or from threshold effects .",
    "we applied the method to the @xmath241 decay and discussed all possible triangle singularities that might affect the @xmath242 mass distribution from a triangle diagram involving a charmonium , a proton and a @xmath1 hyperon .",
    "we stressed that , should the @xmath5 in the @xmath243 amplitude be in an @xmath6-wave , the intermediate @xmath244 pair plays a very special role , since the threshold and triangle singularities merge . in many of the other cases we see that they do not develop a triangle singularity , but",
    "the threshold cusp is always present as it should .",
    "we also made a study of the different cases using dynamical features and some phenomenology and concluded that the relevant singularities , if strong enough to be observable , should develop from @xmath211 and @xmath236 intermediate states .",
    "then we saw that in the case of @xmath245 for the narrow @xmath38 , as presently favoured by the experiment , the @xmath246 transition requires @xmath247 in @xmath248 in the first case and @xmath249 in the second .",
    "this feature smoothens very much the peak to the point that the interpretation of the experimental peak on this singularity runs into obvious inconsistencies . in this case",
    "a singularity stemming from the @xmath236 intermediate state proceeds with @xmath236 in an @xmath6-wave , located at around 4624  mev in the @xmath242 invariant mass .",
    "the flat distribution in the experimental data would mean that the @xmath250 is not strong enough to make the triangle singularity observable .",
    "these considerations lead us to conclude that if the narrow @xmath32 has quantum numbers @xmath245 , reported as the preferable quantum numbers in the lhcb analysis of their data , it would have an origin other than a triangle singularity from the @xmath1charmonium  proton intermediate states .",
    "should this narrow peak correspond to @xmath251 or @xmath252 , the @xmath248 can proceed in @xmath6-wave . in such a case",
    "we could show that the @xmath248 intermediate state and the @xmath158 would be favoured over the other possible @xmath253 intermediate states .",
    "this was because the mass of the @xmath158 makes the triangle and threshold singularities merge at the same energy .",
    "we also saw that in this case the contribution of the other @xmath1 states could provide a relevant contribution due to the threshold singularity .",
    "we admit that the @xmath254 amplitude is ozi suppressed , and we do not know its strength .",
    "however , we also notice that the nplqcd collaboration recently reported possible existence of charmonium - nucleus bound states in their lattice qcd calculation even when extrapolated to the physical pion mass  @xcite .    the spin and parity assignment to the two @xmath38 structures reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is not fully settled and further work continues in the collaboration to be more assertive in the near future .",
    "further stimulus for this task stems from the recent work  @xcite , which shows that from the @xmath255 and @xmath206 invariant mass distributions alone , one can not asset the spin and parity of the two @xmath38 structures , nor the need for the broad @xmath256 state .",
    "the work also shows that contact terms , that turn out to be negligible in the experimental analysis , can make up for the effect of the @xmath256 in the invariant mass distributions .",
    "of course , the experiment contains and analyzed far more data than the invariant mass distributions , and , in particular , angular correlations are essential to determine the spin - parity of the structures . yet , whether or not and how possible triangle singularities discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite might affect the experimental fits and the determination of quantum numbers are still open questions .",
    "an important step towards revealing the exotic nature of the @xmath32 can be made once they are answered . by the amplitudes for the @xmath257 triangle diagram as well as other possible triangle singularities discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] at last , it is worthwhile to mention that even if it will be shown experimentally that there is a pentaquark state at around 4.45  gev , the triangle singularity could play a role of enhancing the peak signal .",
