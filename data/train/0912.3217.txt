    "the fluctuations in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) contain an amazing amount of information about our universe .",
    "detailed measurements of anisotropy in the cmb reveal global properties , constituents and history of the universe .",
    "in standard cosmology , cmb anisotropy is assumed to be statistically isotropic and gaussian .",
    "gaussianity implies that the statistical properties of the temperature field can be completely characterized in terms of its mean @xmath0 , and auto - correlation function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , is a unit vector on the sphere .",
    "the angular brackets @xmath3 denote ensemble expectation values , i.e , averages above are for all possible realizations of the field over a sphere .",
    "since we have one cmb sky , that is just one out of all possible realizations , the ensemble expectation value @xmath4 can be estimated in terms of sky averages only to a limited extent , depending on underlying symmetries in @xmath4 . under the usual assumption of _ statistical isotropy _ ( si ) , implying essentially einstein s cosmological principle for cosmological perturbations , the correlation function is invariant under rotations .",
    "it implies the correlation function @xmath5 , can be readily estimated by averaging over all pairs of sky directions separated by an angle @xmath6 .",
    "spherical harmonics form a basis of the vector space of complex functions on a sphere , making them a natural choice for expanding the temperature anisotropy field , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the temperature fluctuation around some average temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the complex quantities @xmath10 are drawn from a gaussian distribution , related to the gaussian temperature anisotropy as @xmath11 the condition for si now takes the form of a diagonal covariance matrix , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the well known angular power spectrum . in the si case , the angular power spectrum carries complete information about the gaussian field , and the statistical expectation values of the temperature fluctuations are preserved under rotations in the sky .",
    "this property of cmb has been under scrutiny since the release of the first year of wmap data .",
    "tantalizing evidence for statistical isotropy violation in the wmap data using a variety of statistical measures has also been claimed in recent literature  @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of these ` deviations ' from si remains to be modeled adequately .",
    "these deviations could be either genuinely cosmological , or statistical coincidence , or residual foreground contamination , or , a systematic error in the experiment and the data processing .",
    "hence , it is important to carry out a systematic study of si violations using statistical measures within a unified , mathematically complete , framework .",
    "moreover , it is important to develop several independent statistical measures to study si violations that can capture different aspects of any measured violation and provide hints toward its origin .    while testing a fundamental assumption , such as si , is in itself a justifiable end , there are also strong theoretical motivation to hunt for si violations in cmb on large scales .",
    "topologically compact spaces  @xcite and anisotropic cosmological models  @xcite , cosmological magnetic fields generated during an early epoch of inflation  @xcite can also lead to violation of si  @xcite , are but a few examples .",
    "this paper focuses on linking measures of si violation to the reduced symmetries of the underlying correlation patterns in the cmb map or the correlation function .",
    "while we present illustrative examples of the symmetries from various mechanisms of si violation , this paper does not concern itself with a study of specific mechanisms .",
    "we define , within the framework of bipolar harmonic representation of cmb sky maps , a number of observables that can be used to quantitatively test si .",
    "we present a study of the properties of bipolar measures as one systematically reduces the rotational symmetries of the cmb correlations , as is expected in different theoretical scenarios .",
    "we recapitulate the bipolar harmonic representation and the definitions of a set of measurable quantities representing si violation in section [ bipfor ] . in section [ sec : symm ] , these observable measures are computed for different levels of residual rotational symmetries of cmb correlations .",
    "this provides a clear understanding of the underlying symmetries revealed through the different bipolar measures .",
    "section  [ bianchi ] deals with bipolar formalism measurables using bianchi template .",
    "section  [ disc ] summarizing conclusions and discussions is followed by appendices where details of the calculations leading to results are presented .",
    "any deviations from si introduces _ off - diagonal _ terms in the covariance matrix eq .",
    "( [ eq : si ] ) , thereby making @xmath13 an inadequate quantity to characterize the statistical properties of the temperature field  @xcite .",
    "under such a situation bipolar spherical harmonic expansion , proposed by hajian and souradeep  @xcite , proves to be the most general representation of the two point correlation function , where the angular power spectrum @xmath13 is a subset of bipolar spherical harmonic coefficients ( biposh ) .",
    "two point correlation function of cmb anisotropies can be expanded as @xmath14 here @xmath15 are bipolar spherical harmonic coefficients ( biposh ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are bipolar spherical harmonics  @xcite .",
    "bipolar spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis on @xmath19 , with transformation properties under rotations similar to spherical harmonics . the tensor product in harmonic space",
    "can be explicitly written using clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath20 as , @xmath21",
    "biposh can be extracted by inverse transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bposh ] ) , i.e. , multiplying both sides of this equation by @xmath22 , and using orthonormality of bipolar spherical harmonics .",
    "hence , given a real space correlation pattern biposh coefficients can be found using @xmath23 since @xmath24 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , this gives rise to following symmetry properties of biposh : @xmath27 hence , @xmath28 exists for _ even _ @xmath29 and vanishes otherwise .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the bipolar spherical harmonic ( biposh ) coefficients @xmath30 are a linear combination of elements of the harmonic space covariance matrix including the off - diagonal elements that encode si violation , @xmath31 when si holds the covariance matrix is diagonal , eq .",
    "( [ eq : si ] ) and clebsch property ( [ eq : trieq ] ) , therefore @xmath32 implying that @xmath33 contains all the information on the diagonal harmonic space covariance matrix given by @xmath34 .    the well known power spectrum @xmath34 thus forms a subspace of biposh  @xcite . under si",
    ", the only non - zero bipolar spherical harmonic coefficient will be @xmath35 ( equivalent of @xmath34 ) , all the rest must vanish .",
    "the violation of si thus implies @xmath35 are not sufficient to describe the field .",
    "hence , biposh proves to be a better tool to test si , as non - zero @xmath36 , other then @xmath37 and @xmath38 , terms should confirm its violation .",
    "it is impossible to measure all @xmath36 from just one cmb map because of cosmic variance .",
    "thus we need to combine them in different ways to diagnose different aspects of si violations .",
    "the _ bipolar power spectrum _ ( bips ) is a rotationally invariant , quadratic measure that can be constructed out of biposh coefficients  @xcite .",
    "bips involves averaging over biposh that reduces cosmic variance in comparison to a single cmb map , however this does not erase all the si signatures .",
    "bips is defined as @xmath39 for statistically isotropic models @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "thus a breakdown of si will imply non - zero components of bips . in real space",
    ", @xmath42 can be expressed as @xmath43^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the correlation function after rotating the coordinate system through an angle @xmath45 , about an axis @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 are the coordinates of the pixels @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the rotated coordinate system . the rotation axis @xmath48 , is characterized by two parameters @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",

    "characteristic function _ , and it is invariant under rotation of coordinate system , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the volume element of the three - dimensional rotation group given by @xmath55 a simplified expression for bips in real space is @xmath56 for statistical isotropic model condition @xmath57 can be recovered using orthonormality of @xmath58 , @xmath59    the bips of cmb anisotropy computed from the maps measured by wmap are consistent with si , rulings out its radical violation  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of bips is that its rotational invariance allows for constraints to be placed on the presence of specific forms of cmb correlation patterns independent of the overall orientation in the sky .      in order to extract information on the orientation of si violation , or to detect correlation patterns in a specific direction in the sky , the _ reduced bipolar coefficients _",
    "@xcite , obtained as @xmath60 provide another set of measures .",
    "the summation of biposh over spherical wave - numbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 , reduces the cosmic variance rendering these measurable from the single cmb sky map available .    note that the summation involves both the terms @xmath30 , and @xmath63 , that are related via symmetry properties eq .",
    "( [ eq : bipsym ] ) .",
    "thus for any such combination where @xmath64 is odd , these two terms will cancel each other leaving no contribution to the summation .",
    "the reduced bipolar coefficients @xmath65 , by definition have the following symmetry @xmath66 which indicates @xmath67 are always real .",
    "when si condition is valid , the ensemble average of @xmath65 vanishes for all non - zero values of @xmath29 , @xmath68 these @xmath65 coefficients fluctuate about zero in any given cmb anisotropy map .",
    "therefore , a statistically significant deviation from zero would confirm violation of si .",
    "unlike bips , reduced bipolar coefficients are sensitive to orientation , hence they can assign directions to correlation patterns of the map .",
    "it is possible to visualize correlation patterns using the _ bipolar map _ constructed from the reduced bipolar coefficients @xmath65 as  @xcite , @xmath69 the bipolar map from @xmath65 is computed in the same way as the temperature anisotropy map from a given set of spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath10 .",
    "bipolar map can also be represented in terms of _ tripolar spherical harmonics _ of zero angular momentum ( see appendix [ app : bipolar_map ] for details ) , @xmath70 the tripolar spherical harmonics are expressed as  @xcite @xmath71 where the summation is carried over @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the transformations under rotations of tripolar spherical harmonics are identical to spherical harmonics .",
    "in particular , the tripolar scalar harmonics , which are invariant under rotations , can be expressed as follows , @xmath74 orthogonality and normalization relation is as follows , @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tripolar ] ) its evident that under si the bipolar map is invariant under the rotations , since tripolar scalar harmonics are rotationally invariant and @xmath76 . hence , the map gets contribution only from the monopole term @xmath77 , @xmath78 also , if the temperature map is rotated by a element of rotation group , @xmath79 then bipolar map also rotates identically ( see appendix [ app : rotation ] ) .",
    "for example , if you rotate the temperature map about the z - axis by some angle @xmath80 , @xmath81 the bipolar map will also be rotated about z - axis through same angle @xmath80 @xmath82 however , the wigner - d matrices in the two cases will be different because of different @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) values .",
    "the homogeneity and isotropy of cosmic microwave background points to the friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) model of universe .",
    "flat frw model adequately describes the observed local properties of the universe , but the fact that universe with same local geometry can admit different global topology has been appreciated since the advent of post gr modern cosmology .",
    "this is because einstein s equations describe local properties of the spacetime and can only constrain , but not determine , the global topological structure .",
    "symmetries of the space are preserved in the correlation function and global topology modifies correlation function .",
    "the simply connected ( topologically trivial ) hyperbolic 3-space @xmath85 , and the flat euclidean 3-space @xmath86 , are non - compact and have infinite volume .",
    "there are numerous theoretical motivations , however , to favor a spatially compact universe  @xcite .",
    "compact topologies ( more , generally , multiply connected space ) break the statistical isotropy of cmb in characteristic patterns and induce a cutoff in the power spectrum because of finite spatial size  @xcite .",
    "theoretical possibilities include compact euclidean and hyperbolic 3-spaces which require the space to be multiply connected .",
    "the compact hyperbolic manifolds are not globally homogeneous and they turn out to be not of much interest for the class of symmetries considered under the scope of this paper .",
    "simply connected universes are statistically isotropic , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "in contrast , all compact universe models with euclidean or hyperbolic geometry @xmath88 are statistically anisotropic .",
    "the isotropy of space is broken in multi - connected models ; this breaking of symmetry may be apparent through the presence of some principal directions . in a cylinder , for instance , which is compact in one dimension and infinite in the other two ,",
    "the metric tensor is exactly the same at every point hence it preserves local homogeneity .",
    "however , it is not globally isotropic and does not have the maximal symmetry .",
    "it is noteworthy that globally anisotropic models do not contradict observations , since the homogeneity of space and the local isotropy can ensure the observed isotropy of the cmb , however can influence the spectrum of density fluctuations . multiply - connected models with zero or negative curvature can be compact in some , or all their dimensions .",
    "for instance a toroidal universe , despite its zero spatial curvature , has a finite volume which may in principle be measured .",
    "it contains a finite amount of matter . a cylindrical universe ( in the sense that the spatial sections are cylinders ) , on the other hand , is noncompact in one dimension only and has an infinite volume , although with a finite circumference in the principal direction .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy are experimentally confirmed in the observations of distribution of luminous red galaxies  @xcite , and the isotropy of cmb background  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies in cmb assume statistical isotropy of the universe ( frw model ) .",
    "however , indications for a preferred direction in cmb , have motivated the study of departures from statistical isotropy  @xcite .",
    "these deviations can arise from non - trivial spatial topologies  @xcite , or departures from the background frw metric  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , statistical anisotropies might also arise from coherent magnetic fields in the universe  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic cosmological models have been considered in the past and they lead to characteristic patterns in the cmb sky  @xcite .",
    "the bianchi template is an example of si violation due to departure from background frw geometry . here",
    "we will discuss the signature of anisotropy due to existence of preferred axis ( axes ) on biposh .",
    "such si violations can arise due to non - trivial topologies as well as coherent magnetic fields .    since bipolar formalism is sensitive to structures and patterns in the underlying two point correlation function , particularly the real space correlations , it is a novel tool to characterize statistical anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "rotational symmetry about a preferred axis ( say @xmath89 ) is the simplest way to break si .",
    "in general , the correlation function may be decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic parts  @xcite , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the anisotropic part @xmath92 is orthogonal to the legendre polynomials @xmath93 this decomposition is useful in our study of the symmetries of the cmb correlation patterns / structure that are explicit in real space .      under si ,",
    "the correlation function is a function only of @xmath6 , the angle between the two directions , say , @xmath25 and @xmath94 .",
    "hence , @xmath95 , and the correlation function can be expanded in terms of legendre polynomials @xmath96 where @xmath13 is the angular power spectrum .",

    "@xmath13 contains all the information .    in bipolar representation ,",
    "the condition of si for various observables , described in the previous section , can be summarized as follows  @xcite :    * biposh : @xmath100 * bips : @xmath101 * rbiposh : @xmath102 * bipolar map : @xmath103    therefore , to test a cmb map for statistical isotropy , one should compute the biposh coefficients for the maps and look for non - zero biposh coefficients . cosmic variance calculated for biposh under statistical isotropy",

    "statistically significant deviations from zero would mean violation of statistical isotropy .",
    "the correlation function must satisfy the symmetries of the underlying theory . in friedman models",
    "the symmetry group is so(3 ) , hence the correlation function is invariant under rotations ; any breakdown of si will reduce this symmetry group .",
    "the simplest way to break si is to introduce a favored direction in the sky , in such a case the reduced symmetry group is so(2 ) or cylindrical symmetry . assuming the favored axis to be z - axis , the rotational symmetry about z - axis for any arbitrary @xmath108 will require , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the most general form of the correlation function in such a case is ( see appendix [ app : zerofold ] ) @xmath112 further , if the correlation function is invariant under the reflection , i.e. , looking at a correlation pattern in the sky one can not distinguish whether we are looking up or down the preferred direction , then @xmath113 which leads to a condition that @xmath114 is even .",

    "therefore we have to consider cases when both of them are either odd or even .",
    "in such a case @xmath123 is even and hence @xmath124 vanishes for @xmath125 odd , @xmath126    @xmath127    therefore , the biposh present under cylindrical symmetry are @xmath35 and @xmath128 with even @xmath29 .",
    "using symmetry property of biposh ( [ eq : bipsym ] ) , under cylindrical symmetry we have @xmath129 , i.e. , the biposh are symmetric under the exchange of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "there is another possibility that @xmath10 s have a gaussian distribution with different variance for each @xmath83 mode corresponding to a particular @xmath119 .",
    "this implies breakdown of si , as power in each @xmath83 mode is different , @xmath130 , and the corresponding bipolar coefficients are , @xmath131 in such a case non - zero biposh are @xmath35 and @xmath132 , where multipole moment is even and @xmath133 .",
    "furthermore , it may happen that a given model displays the degeneracy @xmath134 and the rotational symmetry so(3 ) of covariance matrix is restored .",
    "the rbiposh for cylindrical symmetry are , @xmath135 hence the bipolar map for such a symmetry will be , @xmath136 thus the map here looks like a sphere which is divided into latitude bands , or zones , without any longitudinal variation .",
    "a realistic example of cylindrical symmetry is a primordial homogeneous magnetic field which breaks statistical isotropy by inducing a preferred direction ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "therefore , the correlation function between two points ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) depends not only on the angular separation between two points ( @xmath140 ) but also on their orientation with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "this dependence of correlation function on angles between @xmath141 and @xmath137 ( as well as @xmath139 and @xmath137 ) leads to correlation between @xmath119 and @xmath142 modes  @xcite .",

    "violation of si also manifests itself in compact universes with flat universal cover , which exhibits a n - fold rotational symmetry about an axis .",

    "these are visualized by identifying opposite sides of the fundamental polyhedra .",
    "the fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) may be a parallelepiped .",

    "we found that the corresponding pattern in bipolar space becomes a double spiral having a quadrupole in azimuthal space of the bipolar map .",
