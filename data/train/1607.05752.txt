    "in 1966 , marc kac offered a poetic formulation of what came to be a much studied problem involving the geometry of planar domains : does dirichlet spectrum determine a planar domain up to isometry ?",
    "kac s problem inspired a great deal of work much of which centered on developments involving heat invariants .",
    "the appearance of sunada s work involving the construction of isospectral metrics for riemannian manifolds provided powerful new methods for investigating diverse spectral phenomena ; in particular , sunada s method led to the discovery of a number of negative results for inverse spectral problems . in 1992",
    "gordon , web and wolpert used an extension of sunada s method to construct a pair of isospectral , non - isometric planar domains @xcite .",
    "soon after , buser , conway doyle and semmler produced a collection of families of pairs of isospectral non - isometric planar polygonal domains ( we refer to these examples as _ bcds pairs _ ) . their construction ,",
    "again going back to sunada , involves reflecting a `` seed '' triangle across edges ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an example of their construction can be found in section 3 below and plays an important role in our work .",
    "given these negative results in reference to kac s question , one might ask : what are good invariants for planar domains and/or quantum graphs ?",
    "one approach to finding new invariants is to use data which , while not spectral , arise from the normalized dirichlet eigenfunctions in a natural fashion .",
    "an example is afforded by the sequence generated by counting nodal domains .",
    "this approach has been investigated in a recent series of papers in which quantum graph analogs of bcds pairs are produced and their corresponding nodal domain counts are compared ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    another approach to producing non - spectral invariants",
    "is given by integration against the heat kernel .",
    "more precisely , suppose @xmath0 is the dirichlet heat kernel for the domain @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the solution of the inital value problem @xmath3 then one can define the _ heat content of @xmath1 _ @xmath4 as well as a sequence of invariants @xmath5 the invariant @xmath6 sometimes referred to as the _ torsional rigidity of the domain @xmath7 _ can be computed via the solution of a poisson problem .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath8 solves @xmath9 then @xmath10 torsional rigidity arises in the study of elasticity and has a long history ( a source for early work is @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to its role in the mechanics of solid bodies , torsional rigidity is closely related to the expected exit time of brownian motion from the domain @xmath1 and higher values of @xmath11 in ( [ ak1 ] ) correspond to higher moments of the exit time ( cf @xcite , @xcite and references within ) .",
    "for this reason the sequence @xmath12 defined by ( [ ak1 ] ) has been labeled the _",
    "@xmath13-moment spectrum _ associated to @xmath14    it is easy to see that both heat content and the moment spectrum are invariants of the metric .",
    "recent work suggest they play a valuable role in understanding fundamental geometric properties of a given ambient space ( for example , isoperimetry @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) , and one might reasonably ask how such objects compare to dirichlet spectrum as tools to classify domain behavior up to isometry . such a study has been initiated in @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this note , the main results of @xcite can be summarized as follows :    1 .   for smoothly bounded domains ,",
    "the moment spectrum determines the heat content .",
    "2 .   for generic smoothly bounded domains ,",
    "the moment spectrum determines the dirichlet spectrum .    it is a result of gilkey that heat content can not distinguish isospectral planar domains constructed via the sunada method @xcite . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    ", the authors establish that heat content distinguishes the isosspectral domains constructed by chapman and in @xcite the authors construct combinatorial analogs of bcds pairs and explicit check that their heat contents differ ( at the fifth coefficient ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is that with respect to heat content , quantum graph analogs of bcds pairs behave more like combinatorial graphs than planar domains , and that torsional rigidity is sufficient to distinguish well - known examples of isospectral pairs .",
    "more precisely , we have    [ theorem1]let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the @xmath17-pair of isopectral non - isometric planar polygonal domains as constructed by buser , conway , doyle and semmler and let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be their quantum graph analogs ( cf section 3 below )",
    ". then @xmath18 and @xmath19 are isospectral , non - isometric and distinguished by their torsional rigidity .",
    "in addition to establishing theorem 1 , we prove    [ theorem2 ] the moment spectrum of a quantum graph with dirichlet standard boundary conditions ( cf section 2 below ) determines the heat content of the quantum graph .    as an immediate corollary",
    ", we conclude that our isospectral non - isometric pairs are distinguished by their heat content .",
    "our technique applies to the other families of isospectral pairs constructed in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this note is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we establish the required background information concerning quantum graphs , establish our notational conventions and prove theorem [ theorem2 ] . in the third section we review the sunada construction in the context of planar domains following buser , conway , doyle and semmler and include the construction of isospectral non - isometric quantum graph analogs of bcds pairs . in the fourth section of the paper",
    "we explicitly compute the torsional rigidity for a pair of isospectral non - isometric quantum graphs and check they differ .",
    "we end the paper with a previously studied example ( @xcite ) of a pair of isospectral non - isomorphic weighted combinatorial graphs which arise as analogs of bcds pairs and check that they too are distinguished by their torsional rigidity .",
    "let @xmath20 be a graph with finite vertex set @xmath21 and edge set @xmath22 for @xmath23 denote by @xmath24 the cardinality of the set @xmath25 we will often find it convenient to assign an orientation to edges ; that is , for each edge @xmath26 choose @xmath27 to be either @xmath28 or @xmath29    by a _ path _ in @xmath20 we will mean a sequence of vertices , @xmath30 with @xmath31 we say @xmath20 is connected if every pair of vertices can be connected by a path in @xmath32 we restrict our attention to graphs which are connected and contain no edges of the form @xmath33    we endow @xmath20 with a metric structure as follows .",

    "metric graph_. because @xmath20 and @xmath39 are finite , the resulting metric graph is compact .",
    "we identify functions on @xmath42 with functions along the open edges together with values at each vertex : for @xmath43 we write @xmath44 the metric structure on each edge gives rise to a natural hilbert space associated to @xmath45 write @xmath46)\\ ] ] where the inner product associated to edge @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 let @xmath49 and denote the inner product on @xmath50 by @xmath51 in particular , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total length of the graph @xmath32    there is a natural differential operator acting on functions on the interior of each edge : @xmath54 we wish to extend this operator to a self - adjoint operator on @xmath55-functions on the metric graph .",
    "we sketch the approach developed in @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .    for each @xmath34",
    "let @xmath56 denote @xmath57 let @xmath58 and set @xmath59 then the operator @xmath60 which acts on @xmath61 according to @xmath62 is closed , symmetric and densely defined .",
    "we seek to impose boundary conditions which give self - adjoint extensions of @xmath60 to @xmath63    we begin by noting that boundary values of functions along edges lie in the space @xmath64 where the order of the components is fixed by the orientation .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath65 let @xmath66 be given by @xmath67 boundary conditions can then be described by a pair of linear operators @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 those pairs of linear operators @xmath70 leading to self - adjoint extensions of @xmath60 have been classified by kostrykin , potthoff and schrader @xcite using a symplectic formalism going back to at least to novikov .",
    "we are interested in a single special case , _ dirichlet standard boundary conditions , _ which we now describe .",
    "[ sbc ] denote by dsbc the collection of continuous functions defined by @xmath71 where the derivative occurring in ( [ standard ] ) is always directed into the vertex @xmath72 and , as before , @xmath73 is the collection of edges on which @xmath72 is incident .",
    "we note that the literature often refers to `` standard boundary conditions '' as those involving kirchoff conditions at internal vertices ( ie vertices of degree at least 2 ) and neumann conditions at boundary vertices ( ie vertices of degree 1 ) .",
    "we can describe standard boundary conditions using pairs of matrices @xmath70 as follows : for each vertex @xmath72 with @xmath74 introduce @xmath75 matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( cf also @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath78 for vertices of degree 1 , define @xmath79 matrices @xmath80 and @xmath81 the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 referenced above then take a block form : @xmath82 we note that dirichlet standard boundary conditions are local in the sense of @xcite and do not mix derivatives with function values .",
    "we note that dirichlet standard boundary conditions force continuity across all internal vertices for all elements in the corresponding domain of the self - adjoint extension of @xmath83 thus , it is the choice of boundary conditions which ultimately ties the geometry and topology of the quantum graph to the analysis of the corresponding laplace operator .",
    "we will denote the self - adjoint extension of @xmath60 with dirichlet standard boundary conditions as @xmath84 the pair consisting of the metric graph @xmath20 and the operator @xmath85 is the quantum graph we study .    the spectrum of @xmath85 is discrete and of finite multiplicity .",
    "we will denote the spectrum of @xmath85 by @xmath86 we will assume there is at least one boundary vertex and we will list elements of @xmath87 in increasing order with multiplicity : @xmath88 there is a great deal known about the spectrum for arbitrary self - adjoint boundary conditions . for our purposes it is important that there is a heat kernel which can be written as @xmath89 the heat content of @xmath20 can then be defined via integration as for domains : @xmath90 we let @xmath91 denote the set of values defined by the dirichlet standard boundary conditions ( ie we disregard multiplicity ) for which the corresponding eigenspace is not orthogonal to constant functions .",
    "then we can write the heat content in a fashion which makes explicit its non - spectral nature : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the square of the @xmath55-norm of the projection of the constant function 1 on the eigenspace defined by @xmath94    the moments of @xmath95 define a sequence associated to the quantum graph @xmath32 more precisely , as in the introduction , for @xmath11 a natural number , set @xmath96    the moment spectrum of the graph @xmath20 is the sequence @xmath97    from the definition it is clear that the heat content determines the moment spectrum .",
    "the converse ( theorem [ theorem2 ] above ) is also true :    the moment spectrum of the quantum graph @xmath20 determines the heat content of the quantum graph @xmath32    proof the proof follows the case of domains , where the same result holds ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . for completeness",
    "we provide the argument given in @xcite .",
    "it suffices to show that the moment spectrum determines both @xmath91 and the collection of coefficients @xmath98 the important observation is that the moment spectrum describes special values of the mellin transform of the heat content .",
    "more precisely , using ( [ heatc2 ] ) , the mellin transform of the heat content is given by the dirichlet series @xmath99 which converges for real part of @xmath100 nonnegative and admits a meromorphic extension to the plane , with poles at the negative half - integers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the moment spectrum then satisfies @xmath101    using ( [ zeta1 ] ) and ( [ zeta2 ] ) , there is a recursion : write @xmath102 with @xmath103 strictly increasing .",
    "then @xmath104 and @xmath105 having determined @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 we have @xmath109 and @xmath110 this shows that both @xmath91 and the length partition of @xmath20 are determined by the @xmath13-moment spectrum . using the spectral representation of the heat content ( [ heatc1 ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath91 and the coefficients @xmath93 determine the heat content .",
    "this proves that the @xmath13-moment spectrum determines heat content and completes the proof of theorem [ theorem2 ] .",
    "our primary interest is in @xmath6 which , as in the case of smooth domains , can be described via a solution of a poisson problem on the graph @xmath32 more precisely , let @xmath8 solve @xmath111 we can apply fubini s theorem to interchange the order of integration in the definition of the heat content and @xmath112 to obtain @xmath113 given any quantum graph with dirichlet standard boundary conditions , the computation of the right - hand - side of ( [ tt2 ] ) is an exercise in linear algebra . we compute torsional rigidity for certain pairs of quantum graphs constructed in the next section .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , buser , conway , doyle and semmler have constructed families of pairs of isospectral planar domains that are not isometric .",
    "their construction and investigation of the resulting pairs is spectacularly simple . to construct families of pairs of isospectral planar domains ,    *",
    "fix a seed triangle with edges labeled ; * reflect the seed about its edges to produce a second generation of labeled triangles ; * for each of the progeny , reflect and label across edges determined by two rules derived from subgroups which are `` nearly conjugate '' in sunada s sense * iterate * interpret the edges as distinct lengths of an acute triangle .",
    "an example of the construction is given in figure 1 : the so - called @xmath17 pairs ( for complete details see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]        having constructed families of pairs as above , buser et al prove that the associated pairs are isospectral using the technique of eigenfunction transplantation .",
    "given an eigenfunction @xmath114 on one domain , say @xmath115 they use the process by which the domain is constructed to naturally partition the domain into a collection of isometric subdomains , say @xmath116 where @xmath117 indexes the number of triangles occurring in the construction , say @xmath118 the same procedure carried out on the domain pair , say @xmath119 results in a collection @xmath120 of isometric subdomains of @xmath121 having partitioned both domains into collections of subdomains , they restrict the given eigenfunction to each subdomain to produce an associated collection of functions , @xmath122 on isometric copies of the same subdomain .",
    "they then use the geometry of the underlying domains @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( ie , how the domains are constructed from the collections of subdomains ) to construct a linear map which prescribes how to build an associated eigenfunction on the domain @xmath16 by combining the function elements @xmath123 on each subdomain of @xmath121 the process by which an explicit transplantation map is constructed is described neatly in the references @xcite and @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is important to note that the process is essentially combinatorial in the sense that it depends only on the following :    * the eigenfunction @xmath114 vanishes at the boundary of @xmath124 * to smoothly continue the eigenfunction @xmath114 across the boundary of the domain @xmath115 the reflection principle requires that the value of @xmath125 be prescribed to be @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the reflection image of @xmath128 * if @xmath129 and @xmath130 are subdomains which share a boundary internal to @xmath115 the associated eigenfunction elements @xmath131 and @xmath132 and their respective normal derivatives must match along the common boundary .",
    "there are also techniques to produce _ quantum graph _",
    "analogs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to proceed , we recall the required definitions .",
    "following earlier work ( cf @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) band , parzanchevski and ben - shach have described an extension of eigenfunction transplantation in the context of quantum graphs @xcite . they provide a method which associates to every family of pairs constructed in @xcite , a family of pairs of quantum graphs which are isospectral but not isometric .",
    "the construction technique is straightforward , as is the check that the objects satisfy the required conditions .",
    "we sketch the process below and produce the pairs associated to the @xmath17 pairs in figure 2 .",
    "for each pair of isospectral nonisometric domains found in @xcite ,    * for each triangle appearing in the bcds construction , introduce a 3-star graph consisting of three edges , with edges labeled with a label from the edges of the corresponding triangle , joined at a central vertex . *",
    "join edges in 3-stars at a common degree two vertex if corresponding edges in the triangles to which they are associated overlap .",
    "we carry out the process on quantum graphs corresponding to @xmath17 pairs in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that for the graphs to be isometric , it would be necessary to map the 3-stars corresponding to generating triangles onto each other .",
    "[ fig2 ]        for neumann standard boundary conditions , the quantum graph analogs are shown to be isospectral and non - isometric in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is accomplished by showing that the graphs share the same secular equation .",
    "the same argument can be made to work in the current context , but instead we provide an explicit transplantation map .",
    "in fact , it s easy to check that the transplantation map used to establish that the bcds pairs are isometric works to show that the associated quantum graphs pairs are isometric .",
    "we do this as follows :    * label the edges of the quantum graph @xmath18 and the corresponding partner @xmath133 * given an eigenfunction on @xmath134 restrict to 3-star subgraphs to obtain a collection of functions defined on isometric 3-stars .",
    "* use the linear map constructed following @xcite to construct the required transplantation map taking eigenfunctions of @xmath18 to eigenfunctions of @xmath133    we can formalize these observations with    [ 71pairs]the quantum graph ( with dirichlet standard boundary conditions ) analogs of the pairs constructed in @xcite are isospectral and non - isometric .",
    "_ proof _ by construction , for each domain constructed in @xcite the corresponding quantum graph is obtained by replacing subdomains with 3-stars , gluing 3-stars along boundaries which correspond to boundaries which are glued in subdomains .",
    "the transplantation map for domains may be represented by a matrix acting on function elements defined on subdomains , all of which can be identified .",
    "this defines a linear map from eigenfunctions on @xmath18 to functions on @xmath135 which we will write as @xmath136 give an eigenfunction @xmath137 on @xmath18 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath138 to see that the image @xmath139 is an eigenfunction on @xmath19 first note that on the interior of every edge , @xmath140 by linearity .",
    "thus , it suffices to check that @xmath139 has value zero at the boundary of @xmath19 and that @xmath139 behaves as it should across glued edges .",
    "but for this to be the case requires only the three properties listed in our description of the transplantation process given above .",
    "since the gluing relations for quantum graphs are precisely those that are prescribed by the domains and the boundary conditions are dirichlet in both cases , these three properties must hold for the image of @xmath137 under @xmath136 in particular , @xmath139 must be an eigenfunction corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath94    we give the required transplantation map in figure 3 .",
    "we are now in a position to prove theorem [ theorem1 ] for the @xmath17 pairs of figure 2 .",
    "we begin by noting that we can eliminate vertices of degree 2 and replace the corresponding two edges by a single edge of length equal to the sum of the corresponding edges ( following friedlander @xcite , we call such quantum graphs _ clean _ ) .",
    "this results in the pair of quantum graphs given in figure 4 .",
    "note that there is a symmetry : interchanging @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the two graphs maps one graph onto the other .",
    "we use this symmetry in the computation of the torsional rigidity of each graph .",
    "suppose we denote by @xmath143 for the coordinate on the @xmath144th edge of the @xmath117th graph .",
    "then we must solve @xmath145 with boundary conditions determined by our choice of dirichlet standard boundary conditions .",
    "the solution on each edge is of the form @xmath146 where the constants @xmath147 and @xmath148 are to be determined from the dirichlet standard boundary conditions .",
    "thus , for each graph there are 30 constants to be determined using nine dirichlet boundary conditions at vertices of degree 1 , seven kirchoff boundary conditions at vertices of degree 3 , and fourteen continuity conditions at vertices of degree 3 .",
    "this determines a linear system @xmath149 where the coefficient matrix @xmath150 is a sparse @xmath151 matrix and the constant vector @xmath152 is defined in terms of continuity constraints and conservation at internal nodes .",
    "the structure of the matrix will be determined by our choice of edge labels and orientation .",
    "we choose the first nine edges to be those incident to boundary vertices and we orient the edges to be inward facing relative to the boundary . with this choice the coefficients @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 with the remaining edges oriented to point toward the `` central node ''",
