    "one of the most remarkable structures in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is a change of the spectral index @xmath0 of the power law @xmath1 at an energy of about 4  pev , the so called . in the literature various reasons for the origin of the are discussed @xcite .",
    "some popular concepts are : the maximum energy attained during the acceleration at supernova remnant shock waves @xcite , reacceleration in the galactic wind @xcite , acceleration in pulsars @xcite , or leakage of particles from the galaxy during the propagation process @xcite .",
    "different scenarios are the acceleration of cosmic rays in @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite . during the propagation through the galaxy cosmic - ray particles",
    "are proposed to interact with dense photon fields close to the sources or with background neutrinos @xcite . as a last possibility , new processes between elementary particles in the atmosphere",
    "are postulated which may transfer energy into non - observed channels and thus cause a in the observed air shower components @xcite .",
    "an answer to the question of the cause for the is expected to reveal also crucial information on the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "experimental access to such questions is provided by measurements of charged cosmic rays ( the classical nucleonic component ) and @xmath0-rays with experiments above the atmosphere and by the observation of air showers initiated by high - energy particles in the atmosphere .",
    "a wealth of information on potential cosmic - ray sources is provided by recent measurements of tev @xmath0-rays from shell type supernova remnants with the h.e.s.s .",
    "experiment @xcite .",
    "the observations reveal a shell structure of the remnant and an energy spectrum of @xmath0-rays @xmath2 in agreement with the idea of particle acceleration in the shock front .",
    "the spectrum extends up to energies of 10  tev and provides evidence for the existence of particles with energies beyond 100  tev at the shock front that emerged from the supernova explosion .",
    "the gyromagnetic radius of a proton with an energy of 1  pev in the galactic magnetic fields is about 0.4  pc and consequently the probability to detect a source in charged galactic cosmic rays is rather small .",
    "indeed , observations by the kascade experiment did not reveal any significant evidence for point sources in the energy range from 0.3 to about 100  pev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , information on the sources is derived from detailed measurements of the cosmic - ray composition .",
    "investigations of the abundance of refractory nuclides reveal that their abundance at the sources is extremely similar to the abundance observed in the solar system @xcite .",
    "this indicates that cosmic rays are accelerated from a well - mixed sample of contemporary interstellar matter .",
    "information on the propagation of particles through the galaxy is obtained by measurements of the ratio from primary to secondary nuclei , the latter are produced in spallation reactions of cosmic rays with particles of the interstellar medium , and the abundance of radioactive nuclides in cosmic rays .",
    "measurements by the cris experiment yield a residence time for cosmic rays in the galaxy of @xmath3  yrs and a propagation path length of about 10  2 for particles with gev energies @xcite",

    "the individual measurements agree within a factor of two in the flux values and a similar shape can be recognized for all experiments with a at energies of about 4  pev .",
    "typical values for the systematic uncertainties of the absolute energy scale for air shower experiments are about 15 to 20% . renormalizing the energy scales of the individual experiments to match the all - particle spectrum obtained by direct measurements in the energy region up to almost a pev requires correction factors in the order of @xmath5% @xcite . a remarkable result , indicating that behind an absorber of 11 hadronic interaction lengths or 30 radiation lengths the energy of the primary particle is determined with an absolute error in the order of @xmath5% .",
    "one should keep in mind that the experiments investigate different air shower components , are situated at different atmospheric depths , and use different interactions models to interpret the observed data .",
    "nevertheless , the systematic differences are relatively small and the all - particle spectrum seems to be well known .",
    "average experimental fluxes are tabulated in @xcite .",

    "the experiments casa - mia @xcite , eas - top @xcite , or kascade use muons with an energy of several 100  mev to 1  gev . to study systematic effects two hadronic interaction models are used to interpret the data measured with kascade @xcite .",
    "high energy muons detected deep below rock or antarctic ice are utilized by the eas - top / macro @xcite and spase / amanda @xcite experiments .",

    "the experimental values follow a trend predicted by the as indicated by the lines in the figure .",
    "however , individual experiments exhibit systematic deviations of about @xmath16 unit in @xmath17 from the line .",
    "of particular interest are also the investigations of the kascade experiment , interpreting the same measured data with two different models for the interactions in the atmosphere results in a systematic difference of about 0.7 to 1 in @xmath17 .        another technique to determine the mass of cosmic rays are measurements of the average depth of the shower maximum using non - imaging and imaging detectors as well as fluorescence telescopes at the highest energies .",
    "the results of several experiments are presented in as function of energy .",
    "the observed values are compared to predictions of air shower simulations for primary protons and iron nuclei using the program corsika @xcite with the hadronic interaction model qgsjet  01 @xcite and a modified version with lower cross sections and larger values for the elasticity of the hadronic interactions ( model  3a in @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is compatible with measurements at colliders , for details see @xcite .",
    "the lower values for the total inelastic proton - antiproton cross sections yield also lower inelastic proton - air cross sections , which are in good agreement with recent measurements from the hires experiment @xcite . in principle , the difference between the solid and the dashed lines in the figure represents an estimate of the projection of the experimental errors from collider experiments on the average depth of the shower maximum in air showers . at @xmath18  gev",
    "the difference between the two model versions for primary protons is about half the difference between proton and iron induced showers .",
    "this illustrates the significance of the uncertainties of the collider measurements for air shower observables .        knowing the average depth of the shower maximum for protons @xmath19 and iron nuclei @xmath20 from simulations , the mean logarithmic mass is derived in the superposition model of air showers from the measured @xmath21 using @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath17 values , obtained from the results shown in , are plotted in versus the primary energy using both interaction models to interpret the observed data .",
    "up to about a pev there are only marginal differences between the two interpretations . on the other hand , at large energies a significantly heavier composition",
    "is obtained for the modified version ( model  3a ) . at @xmath18",
    "gev the differences amount to about 1 in @xmath17 .",
    "these examples illustrate how strong the interpretation of air shower measurements depends on model parameters such as the inelastic cross sections or elasticities used . at tevatron energies the cross sections vary within the error range given by the experiments and at @xmath6  gev the proton air cross sections of qgsjet and model  3a differ only by about 10% , but the general trend of the emerging @xmath17 distributions proves to be significantly different .",
    "this underlines the importance to test and improve the understanding of hadronic interactions in the atmosphere with air shower experiments @xcite .",
    "it seems that the interpretation with model  3a is better compatible with the mean logarithmic masses derived from electrons , muons , and hadrons already shown in and also with the predictions of the as indicated by the lines .",

    "simulations reveal that these events , where only one hadron is registered in a large calorimeter , are sensitive to the flux of primary protons .",
    "the derived proton fluxes agree with the results of direct measurements as can be inferred from , indicating a reasonably good understanding of the hadronic interactions in the atmosphere for energies below 1  pev .    at higher energies",
    "a breakthrough has been achieved by the kascade experiment .",
    "measuring simultaneously the electromagnetic and muonic component of air showers and unfolding the two dimensional shower size distributions , the energy spectra of five elemental groups have been derived @xcite . in order to estimate the influence of the hadronic interaction models used in the simulations , two models , namely qgsjet  01 and sibyll @xcite , have been applied to interpret the measured data .",

    "the absolute flux values differ by about a factor of two or three between the different interpretations .",

    "the observed spectra seem to exhibit cut - offs proportional to the nuclear charge .",
    "the increase of the mean logarithmic mass derived from air shower observations seems to be compatible with subsequential cut - offs for individual elements .",

    "in particular , the inclusion of the hadronic component will help to improve the interaction models at these energies .",
    "a new technique to measure air showers is about to be established : the lopes experiment has registered first air showers observing geosynchrotron emission in the radio frequency range from 40 to 80  mhz @xcite .    the presently largest balloon borne detector , the tracer experiment @xcite , almost reaches the energy region of indirect measurements .",
    "successor experiments will provide twofold progress for the understanding of the origin of galactic cosmic rays : an extension of the measurements of the ratio of secondary to primary nuclei to energies approaching the will improve the knowledge about the propagation of cosmic rays and the extension of energy spectra with individual element resolution towards the air shower regime will provide useful information to improve hadronic interaction models .",
