    "a large number of astrophysical and cosmological observations provide convincing evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the origin and nature of dm remain largely unknown , and are among the most challenging problems in current cosmology and most likely in particle physics .",
    "recently , the distribution of dm around a black hole ( bh ) has been under discussion in the context of indirect searches for dm annihilation signals with @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "gondolo and silk @xcite first suggested that the adiabatic growth of a bh creates a high density dm region , called the `` spike '' , which enhances the dm annihilation rate .",
    "subsequent work showed that the existence of a dm spike around a supermassive black hole turns out to be unlikely when one considers the effects of major merger events of the host galaxies @xcite , off - center formation of the seed bh @xcite , and scattering of dark matter particles by surrounding stars @xcite . on the other hand , a dm `` minispike '' around an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) , with a mass range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "may survive if the imbh never experienced any major mergers @xcite , as is expected to be the case for the many imbhs that have failed to merge into a supermassive bh .",
    "the existence of such a spike structure is strongly dependent on the details of bh formation and the history of major mergers , which are far from clear . in this paper",
    ", we propose that future gravitational wave ( gw ) experiments can be used to probe the dm distribution around bhs .",
    "the existence of the dense dm region changes the gravitational potential and affects the orbit of an object around the bh .",
    "we consider gws from the coalescence event of a compact binary consisting of a small mass object and an imbh and evaluate the modification of the gw signal by the existence of a dm minispike associated with the imbh .",
    "such an event may be observed by future space - based interferometers such as the evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa ) , the new gravitational wave observatory ( ngo ) @xcite , and deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite .",
    "we further discuss whether the elisa - ngo experiment is sensitive to the modification of the signal by the dm minispike .",
    "note that , while @xmath0-ray observations can find the signal of dm annihilation if dm is a weakly interacting massive particle , the observation of gws is just sensitive to the gravitational potential of the dm halo and applicable even for noninteracting dm .",
    "therefore , future gw experiments offer a unique opportunity for testing the existence of the dm spike around bhs .",
    "recently the gw signatures of the dm has also been considered by macedo @xmath3.@xcite .",
    "let us describe the radial profile of the dm spike by a single power law @xmath4 assuming a spherically symmetric distribution of dm .",
    "the adiabatic growth of the bh produces a dense spike in the inner region of the minihalo within a radius of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radius of gravitational influence of the bh defined by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the bh mass @xcite .",
    "the final density profile of the spike depends on the power law index @xmath9 of the inner region of the initial minihalo as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if we assume the navarro , frenk , and white profile @xcite for the initial condition ( @xmath11 ) , we get @xmath12 .",
    "a very steep slope is generically predicted as we find @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the largest plausible value of @xmath15 corresponds to an initially isothermal darkmatter profile @xmath16 .",
    "le delliou @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite have given an analytic estimate of the radial distribution of the profile .",
    "to be conservative , we restrict @xmath15 to below 3 throughout this paper .    in summary , in this paper ,",
    "we assume the dm distribution of a minispike is described by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalization of the dm density . for an imbh with the mass of @xmath20 and the total mass of the dm minihalo of @xmath21",
    ", we get @xmath22 and @xmath23 . beyond the spike radius @xmath24",
    ", the dm distribution obeys the nfw profile with the concentration parameter @xmath25 estimated based on the fitting formula given , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the minimum radial distance is taken to be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) given by @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider gravitational waves from a binary system consisting of an imbh with a mass of @xmath29 and a compact object with a mass of @xmath30 . for simplicity , we make the following idealization .",
    "first , we treat the star as a test particle and we call it a `` particle '' in the following .",
    "second , we assume that the dm density is unperturbed even when the star orbits in the dm minispike",
    ". gravitational heating of the dm minispike due to the particle may be noticeable within the hill sphere of the particle because of the gravity of the central imbh . in the case of our @xmath31-@xmath32 binary ,",
    "the hill radius is 10% of the orbital radius and we ignore possible heating effects in the first order approximation .",
    "then , the equation of motion for the particle is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the angular momentum of the particle per its mass , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath37    in the first term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) , the dm minispike modifies the effective mass of the central imbh .",
    "the second term contains information of the dm minispike radial distribution .",
    "the third term represents a centrifugal force .",
    "note that the dm particles do not exist stably within @xmath38 and we assume @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , @xmath36 represents the effect of dm assuming that the dm distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhodm ] ) for @xmath41 . instead",
    ", the effective mass of the bh @xmath42 is reduced to offset the extra mass in @xmath43 .    if we assume that the second term is much smaller than the first term , @xmath44 we can treat the term which involves information on the dm minispike as a perturbation and expand equations in powers of @xmath45 , which is a dimensionless parameter depending on the power index @xmath15 .",
    "when the particle stably orbits around the imbh at a constant radius @xmath46 , the left - hand side of the equation of motion vanishes",
    ". in this case , the gw waveforms are given by @xmath47 to the lowest order approximation where @xmath48 is the inclination which is the angle between the normal to the orbit and the line of sight , and @xmath49 is the gw frequency .",
    "next , we include the effect of the gw backreaction within the linearized theory of einstein s general relativity .",
    "the orbital radius and frequency are no longer constant , because gw radiation energy @xmath50 is taken from the orbital energy @xmath51 of the particle .",
    "the relation between the orbital radius @xmath46 and the time @xmath52 is given by the energy balance ( e.g. , chap . 4 of @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 using this relation , we can compute the orbital frequency @xmath55 and @xmath46 as a function of time . to include the gw backreaction in the gw waveforms",

    "( [ eq : waveform1 ] ) and ( [ eq : waveform2 ] ) by time - dependent functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "these expansions are valid for the frequency @xmath64 for which higher order terms are negligible .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) , the phase of the gw is modified by the presence of the dm , which is expanded in powers of @xmath45 . since gw interferometers are very sensitive to the phase of the signal , this phase difference is crucial for distinguishing the existence of the dm minispike . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , we plot the phase difference @xmath65 caused by the dm minispike , taking into account terms up to second order in @xmath45 .",
    "we see @xmath66 increases for low frequencies and for large @xmath15 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the orbit of the object is affected only by the dm mass inside the orbital radius .",
    "more phase difference is produced when the inner mass is large .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] , the enclosed dm mass increases as the radius or @xmath15 increases .",
    "since a low frequency of the gw corresponds to a large orbital radius , a large phase difference is produced at low frequencies . a larger value of @xmath15 , or equivalently a steeper density distribution , leads to a larger inner mass , which also results in a larger phase difference .     against frequency .",

    "let us discuss whether or not this effect is testable by future gw experiments .",
    "the search for gw signals is performed by matched filtering analysis , in which one correlates detector output with theoretical template .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio obtained in the matched filtering technique is defined by @xmath71 ^ 2 } { \\displaystyle\\int_{f_{\\text{ini}}}^{\\infty } df \\",

    "@xmath76 is maximized .",
    "thus , @xmath76 is an indicator to tell us whether the waveform of the template is present in the detector or not .",
    "we would claim detection of gw if the associated @xmath76 ratio is larger than the predefined threshold value . in the literature ,",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath77 is required to claim detection .",
    "let us consider an observation of gws from the @xmath78 particle inspiraling into the @xmath32 imbh , which would be detectable by the elisa experiment .",
    "we assume this binary is surrounded by a dm mini - spike whose distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhodm ] ) . in this setup ,",
    "a frequency integration from @xmath79 corresponds to a @xmath80 yr observation until the coalescence ( corresponding roughly to the expected elisa frequency band and observation time ) . note that when @xmath81mhz , the particle is about @xmath82 pc away from the imbh and well within the minispike .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] , we show how much the @xmath76 is degraded when one applies a template predicted without considering the dm effect on the signal with the dm effect .",
    "the vertical axis represents a degradation rate @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is @xmath76 calculated assuming a template of a waveform without the dm effect ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 is @xmath76 calculated with a template including the dm effect up to the second order . if the effect of the dm is small , there is little difference between the two templates and @xmath83 becomes @xmath87 .",
    "conversely , if dm potential induces significant phase difference , the value of @xmath84 decreases , since the template and the signal have less correlation .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the phase difference becomes significant for large @xmath15 , and , from fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] , we find @xmath83 largely deviates from @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "this means that in order to extract inspiral signals under the effect of a dm minispike , we must prepare templates including the dm effect when @xmath88 . for example , a gw signal that gives @xmath89 when we use the correct template would then give @xmath90 if we use the incorrect one and @xmath91 .",
    "we miss this signal if we do not take account of the effect of a dm minispike .",
    "this result in turn indicates that gw observation can distinguish whether a dm minispike of @xmath88 exists around the imbh .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] , we also plot the cases for different initial integration frequencies , which corresponds to different observation time .",
    "since the phase difference becomes larger at low frequency , @xmath83 is suppressed for smaller value of @xmath15 when one observes a longer time period .",
    "the peak seen at @xmath92 originates from the zero crossing of the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltapsi ] ) .     against power index @xmath15 .",
    "three different curves show @xmath83 for three different values of initial frequency @xmath75 , namely different observation time .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath93 , the dashed line is for @xmath94 and the dot - dashed line is for @xmath95 . , width=377 ]",
    "it has been expected that @xmath0-ray and/or neutrino observations on dm halos enable us to study properties of annihilating dm particles ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we proposed a new method to explore a dense dm minihalo , the so - called dm minispike , using gw signals that is more powerful when dm does not annihilate .",
    "namely , we have demonstrated a method to probe the dm distribution around an imbh by using gw direct detection experiments . considering a gw signal from a compact object inspiraling into an imbh ,",
    "we have computed how the gw waveform is modified by the gravitational potential of the dm halo .",
    "thanks to the fact that a gw interferometer measures the phase of the signal with very good accuracy , we found that a gw experiment such as elisa and ngo is sensitive to the phase shift caused by the dm potential .",
    "indeed , we found that the gw observation can detect the dm effect when dm does not annihilate and its profile is steep enough .",
    "therefore , gw observation would be a complementary method for testing the existence of a dm distribution : while @xmath0-ray and/or neutrino observations are powerful to probe annihilating dm particles , the gw test offers a unique opportunity to detect the presence of nonannihilating dm . this may even offer hints to the formation history of bhs , since formation of dm spikes strongly depends on how bhs evolved .    in future work",
    ", we plan to extend the investigation for different values of mass distribution parameters , such as the power index @xmath15 and the mass of the compact objects and the halo .",
    "we will also estimate to what degree future gw experiments can determine the mass distribution by computing expected errors on the parameters .",
