    "nonlinear interaction of light in a medium provides a very useful framework to study various nonclassical properties of quantum states of radiation .",
    "these nonclassical properties are usually associated with quantum interference and entanglement .",
    "the phase space wigner distribution function description of quantum states of light is a powerful tool to investigate such nonclassical effects . with the help of the wigner function",
    "one can simply visualize quantum interference .",
    "for example , a signature of quantum interference is exhibited in the wigner function by the non - positive values and sub - planck structures @xcite .",
    "the non - positive wigner function is a witness of a nonclassicality and monitors a decoherence process of a quantum state , e.g.  a photon - added coherent state in the photon - loss channel @xcite , photon - subtracted squeezed state @xcite , gaussian quadrature - entangled single photon subtracted light pulse @xcite , two - photon fock state @xcite , odd photon number states superposition @xcite and coherent states superpositions @xcite .",
    "the wigner function has also been used for computing numerically the quantum - mechanical corrections to the classical dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator ( its characteristic pattern , the interference fringes and negative values , served as a signature for a classical to quantum domain transition ) @xcite ; it has been applied in the model of the dynamics of a nanoscale semiconductor laser @xcite , to list only a few examples of its applications .",
    "the kerr medium provides one of the simplest nonlinearity for which there exists a simple analytic wigner function @xcite expression .",
    "the highly @xmath0 nonlinear systems generated a lot of interest recently due to their applications e.g.  to nondemolition measurements  @xcite , quantum computing architectures  @xcite , single particle detectors  @xcite .",
    "the well known example of such a medium is an optical fiber .",
    "however , the nonlinearity is small in fibers and is often accompanied by other unwanted effects . enhanced kerr nonlinearity was studied in terms of electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite and was observed in bose einstein condensates  @xcite and cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "recent proposals predict obtaining enormous kerr nonlinearity using the purcell effect  @xcite , rydberg atoms  @xcite , and interaction of a cavity mode with atoms  @xcite .",
    "the first and last method is predicted to obtain the nonlinearity of nine orders of magnitude higher than natural self - kerr interactions with negligible losses .",
    "the significant nonlinearity has also been observed for nanomechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "most of the investigations of the wigner function of light have been made for steady state situations .",
    "the simplicity of the kerr medium will allow to study the full time - dependent wigner function dynamics with or without a quantum noise .",
    "in this paper we present a fokker - planck equation which determines the time evolution of the wigner function in a noisy @xmath0 medium .",
    "we solve this equation numerically assuming a coherent state as an initial condition .",
    "we discuss first an ideal and then a dissipative kerr medium .",
    "the results obtained for the ideal case reveal the quantum nature of the state under evolution .",
    "the coherent state , known as the most classical among all the pure states , becomes a non - gaussian squeezed state after some time of interaction with the medium .",
    "for some specific times it becomes a finite superposition of other coherent states .",
    "an interference pattern with the negative values is clearly visible on the plots of its wigner function . due to the small value of the @xmath0 nonlinearity and losses in optical fibers",
    "such phenomena have never been observed for light ; neither for any other system . however , it turns out that not all quantum effects are washed out due to the decoherence .",
    "the fokker - planck equation allows for a similar state evolution analysis for any other input state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ fs ] the fokker - planck equation for the wigner function evolution in a @xmath0 medium is derived from the master equation obtained for a single mode of light density operator .",
    "the equation is displayed in a polar coordinates .",
    "the decoherence effects : losses and thermal noise are included .",
    "the initial and boundary conditions for the wigner function are set . in section [ ss ] the numerical results of the wigner function evolution in a nondissipative @xmath0 medium",
    "are introduced and discussed .",
    "these results are obtained using three independent methods : computing the fokker - planck equation and the other two equations determining the wigner function directly , which are obtained from its definition .",
    "correspondence between the wigner function negative values and zeros of the q - function is noted . in section [ ts ]",
    "the influence of the decoherence process on quantum effects such as the interference pattern and the negative values of the wigner function is analyzed .",
    "the technical limitations on the use of the fokker - planck equation are discussed .",
    "the wigner function sub - planck structure is shown in section [ sub ] . in section [ fos ] the numerical methods used in sections [ ss ] and [ ts ]",
    "are compared and discussed . finally some conclusions are presented .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for a totally degenerate four - wave mixing process , e.g. in an optical fiber , is of second - order in creation @xmath1 and annihilation @xmath2 light operators @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a nonlinear constant proportional to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "please note that similar hamiltonian describes a single nanomechanical resonator with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being raising and lowering operators related to its position and momentum operators , and @xmath4 proportional to the duffing nonlinearity  @xcite .    in a general case ,",
    "including damping and thermal noise in the medium , a one - mode density operator evolution , both for light and for a nanomechanical resonator , is determined by the master equation  @xcite @xmath5 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\left([a\\rho(\\tau),a^{\\dagger } ] + [ a , \\rho(\\tau )    a^{\\dagger}]\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\gamma n [ [ a,\\rho(\\tau)],a^{\\dagger } ] , \\label{kerr_master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a unitless evolution parameter , @xmath7 is the interaction time , @xmath8 is a damping constant , @xmath9 is a mean number of photons in a thermal reservoir .    the solutions of the above equation are well known  @xcite but since it is an operator - valued equation , they are inappropriate for computer simulations",
    ". a fokker - planck type evolution equation for the wigner function can be easily obtained from equation  ( [ kerr_master ] ) using the standard quantum optics phase space methods  @xcite .",
    "since every density operator determines its wigner function uniquely , the knowledge of its evolution is equivalent to the full knowledge of the density operator dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the wigner function in a dissipative medium with a self - kerr interaction is governed by the fokker - planck equation , which takes the following form in the polar coordinates @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a point in a phase space , @xmath13 .",
    "this is a third - order nonlinear differential equation .",
    "we compute this equation for the following initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the evolution starts with a coherent state @xmath14 described by a wigner function @xmath15 .",
    "the wigner function tends to zero in the infinity @xmath16 .",
    "since some of the coefficients in equation  ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) are singular for @xmath17 , we take @xmath18 , which was derived from the master equation .",
    "for @xmath19 and @xmath20 the fokker - planck equation  ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) reduces to its first line and describes the evolution in an ideal kerr medium .",
    "figures [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] present the plots of the wigner function for different parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 . due to the fact that the number operator @xmath23 is a constant of motion ,",
    "the probability distribution during its evolution will remain situated within a circle of radius @xmath24 . beginning from a circular shape",
    ", the wigner function turns into an ellipse and squeezing appears in an appropriate direction .",
    "then the ellipse changes into a banana shape and a `` tail '' of the interference fringes appears where the distribution takes the negative values .",
    "squeezing increases and the state becomes non - gaussian .",
    "the `` banana part '' of the distribution gets thinner in the radial direction and becomes more and more smeared in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the rotation and stretching effects which lead to squeezing are revealed by the first term in the first line of the equation  ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) .",
    "it shows the dependence of the angular velocity on the distance @xmath25 from the origin of coordinates .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the nonlinear refractive index @xmath26 of kerr medium is intensity dependent @xmath27 .",
    "the intensity fluctuations modulate the nonlinear refractive index and this in turn modulates the phase of traveling light .",
    "photons with stronger amplitude will acquire phase faster than the photons with smaller amplitude .",
    "the other first line terms of this equation consisting of mixed and third order derivatives are responsible for the interference fringes formulation .",
    "if @xmath21 is taken as a fraction of the period of the evolution , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a rational number , the initial coherent state becomes a superposition of other coherent states , of the same amplitude but different phases , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] @xcite .",
    "this is is also known as a fractional revival  @xcite .",
    "the evolution governed by the self - kerr interaction hamiltonian is periodic .",
    "it is easy to see this using a unitary evolution operator @xmath30 rather than the fokker - planck equation approach .",
    "its action on a coherent state @xmath14 expressed in the fock state basis @xmath31 shows that @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an integer , equation  ( [ eq : kerr ] ) reduces again to the coherent state  @xmath14 .",
    "the same periodicity holds for the wigner function .",
    "this condition has been used as an additional check point in our numerical simulations .    for the wave function given by equation  ( [ eq : kerr ] )",
    "one can determine the wigner function as an analytical function of the evolution parameter @xmath21 using the definition  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the density operator of the state @xmath37 .",
    "we apply the above equation and express it in two equivalent ways which have been used to obtain the numerical results for the nondissipative kerr medium @xmath38 } \\left(\\partial_{\\gamma}\\right)^n \\left(\\partial_{\\gamma^*}\\right)^m e^{-4|\\gamma|^2}.   \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{derivatives}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations  ( [ eq : kerr ] ) and  ( [ derivatives ] ) explain how the interference fringes arise from the interference of the fock number states @xmath39 . by virtue of equation  ( [ derivatives ] ) , the wigner function can be viewed as a sum of the two components : the first one , independent of @xmath21 , being a superposition of the fock states wigner functions @xmath40 and the second , being an evolution dependent component @xmath41 , responsible for the evolution of the fringes @xmath42    although the equation ( [ summation ] ) and ( [ derivatives ] ) are special solutions of the fokker - planck equation , we obtained them separately to proceed independent computation .",
    "the effects of squeezing and error contour rotation in the phase space can also be observed by studying the easy - to - compute q - function evolution @xmath43 the contour plot of the q - function is plotted in @xcite .",
    "solutions of the fokker - planck equation for the q - function in a dissipative and noisy kerr medium have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "negativities achieved in the wigner function correspond to zeros of the q - function  @xcite .",
    "all the figures [ fig:1][fig:4 ] have been obtained computing the equations ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) , ( [ summation ] ) and ( [ derivatives ] ) independently .",
    "in the presence of damping the wigner function will not remain situated within at the circle of the radius @xmath24 any more . the second line in the fokker - planck equation , proportional to the first radial derivative ,",
    "makes the wigner function moving towards the origin of the coordinates .",
    "this effect corresponds to decreasing number of quanta in the state during the evolution . at the origin",
    "the state becomes vacuum .",
    "the third line describes the effects of dispersion .",
    "it is interesting to note an interplay between the nonlinear evolution and damping terms in the fokker - planck equation . if damping is negligible , the numerical simulations obtained for small @xmath44 and large @xmath45 initial amplitudes are very similar . at the beginning of evolution",
    "the squeezing effect dominates and then the interference appears .",
    "it is not the case if the losses are included in the simulations .",
    "if the amplitude is too small the decoherence washes out all the quantum effects and the gaussian wigner function located at the coordinates origin , genuine to vacuum state , is obtained very quickly .",
    "we proceed the numerical computation for experimentally reasonable values genuine to a nanomechanical resonator .",
    "the nonlinear constant @xmath46 and the damping constant @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the thermal noise coefficient in the room temperature is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the nonlinear evolution term @xmath50 for @xmath51 becomes meaningful if @xmath52 . if @xmath53 the damping term @xmath54 dominates over the nonlinear @xmath55 and interference terms .",
    "the coherent state will be almost immediately radially displaced towards the origin of coordinates . for @xmath56",
    "all the effects are in balance : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "computing the fokker - planck equation for such large values of coefficients ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) would require a very dense and large grid , thus a lot of computer memory . therefore , to visualize an influence of these two effects on the wigner function , we rescaled the parameters .",
    "as we pointed out above , in order to see the nonlinear effects during the wigner function evolution in presence of dissipation , the input of nonlinear term has to be of the same order as the dissipation term is .",
    "therefore , we keep the ratio between them constant and equal to the ratio evaluated for the non - rescaled case : @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "they are equal to @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "although such a small value of the thermal coefficient implies a negligible effect on the evolution , we included it in the simulation .",
    "such simulations are accessible using a standard pc computer with 4 gb of memory .",
    "figures [ fig:5 ] , [ fig:6 ] , [ fig:7 ] , [ fig:8 ] present the numerical simulations of the fokker - planck equation obtained for @xmath64 , @xmath66 and the following values of the damping constant : @xmath19 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .    due to the fact that damping washes out the interference effects , any nonzero damping constant prevents both : coherent superposition state formulation and periodicity of the evolution .",
    "as it is well known  @xcite these states are extremely fragile to the decoherence .",

    "if @xmath68 the negative values are present only for @xmath73 and for @xmath74 if @xmath69 .",

    "the structure of superposition coherent states is still well preserved . however , some additional circular trails are present .",
    "these are specially visible for @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for @xmath69 and @xmath75 the state is already a vacuum . the vacuum state is achieved for @xmath76 ( @xmath81 ) if @xmath68 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "in the framework of quantum mechanics , it has been recognized that small structures on the sub - planck scale do show up in quantum linear superpositions @xcite .",
    "such sub - planck structures can be shown , if the wigner function is plotted in a phase - space region below the heisenberg relation .",
    "that means in the phase space volume less than @xmath82 , since @xmath83 for the amplitude @xmath84 and phase @xmath85 quadratures .",
    "the quadratures are given by the annihilation @xmath86 and creation @xmath87 operators and their mean values correspond to phase - space coordinates in the following way @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "figure [ fig:9 ] compares behavior of the sub - planck structure of the wigner function obtained for the compass state ( @xmath90 ) and the schrdinger cat state ( @xmath76 ) for @xmath91 in the ideal @xmath0 medium and in presence of damping ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "this structure is of different form .",
    "the areas of positive and negative values form `` ribbons . ''",
    "figures [ fig:1][fig:4 ] , presenting the wigner function evolution in an ideal @xmath0 medium , have been obtained by three independent numerical simulations : computing of the equations ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) , ( [ summation ] ) and  ( [ derivatives ] ) .",
    "the numerical results of the evolution in a noisy medium have been achieved using only the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) .",
    "all programs used to simulate the wigner function were written in standard c++ language , due to its high speed and good portability .",
    "the structure of the programs used for computation of the equations  ( [ summation ] ) and  ( [ derivatives ] ) was based strictly on these equations : they both consist of two loops which iterate on @xmath96 and @xmath34 ( or @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively ) and sum up the evaluated coefficients for a given @xmath21 and @xmath12 .",
    "common terms were moved out from the loops ( especially the inner one ) to optimize the evaluation of the sums .",
    "the main function was enclosed in input / output logic which calls it for different values of @xmath12 and writes the results to a file .",
    "the equations  ( [ summation ] ) and  ( [ derivatives ] ) involve summation of the infinite series . however , only a finite number of their terms can be computed .",
    "therefore , assuming a given precision of the simulation , we cut the series off .    the series in equation  ( [ summation ] )",
    "is much slower convergent than the series in  ( [ derivatives ] ) because it contains fast oscillating exponential term @xmath99 .",
    "depending on the phase factor in the exponent , this term can take either large or small values , which makes impossible to compute equation  ( [ summation ] ) using the standard double precision floating point number representation .",
    "therefore , for @xmath100 both infinite sums , internal and external , are cut off by including at least @xmath101 terms in each of them . also very high precision ( at least 25 significant digits )",
    "needs to be applied for the computation .",
    "such a high precision was obtained using the free _ class library for numbers _ ( cln ) and its long float type .    on contrary",
    ", it is enough to use standard double precision numbers to compute equation  ( [ derivatives ] ) .",
    "however , we also applied the cln here due to the fact that it can deal with the complex numbers while c++ itself can not .",
    "the same precision was used while computing equation  ( [ derivatives ] ) however , it was enough to take @xmath102 terms in both sums into account to obtain the same results as these which were achieved by computing  ( [ summation ] ) .",
    "this made simulations of equation  ( [ derivatives ] ) much faster .",
    "additionally , the product of the exponens derivatives was replaced with the following formula  @xcite @xmath103    both methods , equations  ( [ summation ] ) and  ( [ derivatives ] ) , allow for computation of the wigner function for an arbitrary evolution parameter @xmath21 and point @xmath12 in the phase space .",
    "evaluation of the function for a chosen @xmath21 does not require simulation of the whole evolution . to visualize the wigner function we calculated it for each point of a @xmath104 square mesh of the size proportional to the value of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 for @xmath109 , @xmath110 for sub - planck structures ) , to show all interesting aspects of the simulated function .    on the contrary , numerical simulation of the fokker - planck equation  ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] ) involves solving a partial differential equation ( pde ) , which in turn requires setting a grid ( discretized phase space ) and solving a set of linear equations ( one equation for each point of the grid ) at each time step .    to solve the pde , the equation  ( [ eq : fokker - planck ] )",
    "was rewritten to difference quotient form , where all the partial derivatives were replaced with appropriate difference quotients of fourth order to keep the order of the quotients even and higher than the order of the equation at the same time .",
    "even difference quotients are more convenient , since they are symmetric with respect to the point where the derivative is taken .",
    "the quotients were determined using the _ mathematica _ program and its ` finitedifferencepolynomial ` function .",
    "we used polar mesh coordinates with constant radial distance @xmath111 and constant angle @xmath112 between points .",
    "below we present the first , second and third derivatives discretized up to the forth order : @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath25 and @xmath117 respectively , @xmath118 is the wigner function value",

    "the main idea of _ implicite _ method is to determine the time derivative between steps @xmath21 and @xmath119 using the spatial derivatives obtained from the next time step @xmath120 , not from the previous one @xmath121 .",
    "this method requires solving a set of linear equations , with wigner function values in the next time step @xmath120 for each point @xmath12 of the mesh as unknowns .",

    "some sanity checks were taken to make sure that the calculations are done properly , e.g.  the integral of the wigner function over the phase space is equal to 1 in each time step .",
    "the value of the integral unequal to 1 was a sign of either too small mesh density or too big time step or too small precision of the calculations .",
