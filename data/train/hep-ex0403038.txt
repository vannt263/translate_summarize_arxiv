    "we explore the systematics of jet fragmentation by the method of two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "this method , which worked well at isr energies ( @xmath3=63  gev ) and below @xcite , is an alternative method to the full jet reconstruction when the use of the latter is difficult or impossible due to high - multiplicities , as in heavy ion collisions .",
    "jets are produced by the hard scattering of two partons @xcite .",
    "two scattered partons propagate nearly back - to - back in azimuth from the collision point and fragment into the jet - like spray of final state particles ( see embedded schematics on where only one fragment of each parton is shown ) .",
    "these particles have a momentum  perpendicular to the partonic transverse momentum , with component  projected onto the azimuthal plane .",
    "the magnitude of  measured at lower energies has been found to be @xmath3 and  independent @xcite .    despite the naive expectation of parton collinearity in the transverse plane , it was found that each of the partons carry the effective transverse momentum @xmath4 , originally described as `` intrinsic '' @xcite .",
    "the measurement of net transverse momenta @xmath5 of diphoton , dimuon or dijet over the wide range of @xmath3 in @xmath0 collisions gives  as large as 5  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this value can not be attributed to the intrinsic transverse momentum given by the constituent quark mass ( @xmath6300  ) and the nlo re - summation techniques has to be invoked @xcite .",
    "-0.5 cm the analysis uses two - particle azimuthal correlation functions ( ) to measure the distribution of the azimuthal angle difference ( @xmath7 ) between pairs of charged hadrons ( see ) .",
    "the correlation function is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the observed @xmath11 distributions of charged particle pairs in the same or mixed events , respectively and @xmath12 is the normalization factor .",
    "we fit the measured  by two gaussians , one for the near - side component ( around @xmath13 ) and one for the far - side component ( around @xmath14 ) , and a constant for the uncorrelated pairs in case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions . in case of @xmath2 correlation functions ,",
    "the background distribution has a `` harmonic '' form @xmath15 with @xmath16 as a free parameter .    for two - particles with average transverse momenta  and  from the same jet , the width of the near - side correlation , @xmath17",
    ", can be related to  as | j_t y | _ n [ eq_jt ] if we assume @xmath18  and @xmath18 . in order to extract  from the width of the away - side peak width @xmath19",
    ", we started with the relation between @xmath20 , the average transverse momentum component of the away - side particle @xmath21 perpendicular to trigger particle @xmath22 in the azimuthal plane , and @xmath23 given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we note however , that @xcite explicitly neglected @xmath24 in the formula at isr energies , where @xmath25  0.85 , while it is not negligible at = 200  gev .",
    "taking @xmath26 into account we derived [ eq_kt ] = 1 x_h where @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_kt ] ) indicates that in order to extract the magnitude of  the external knowledge of the  is needed .",
    "we have analyzed the -dependence of the  invariant cross section measured in @xmath0 collisions @xcite . in the @xmath28  region where the power law function with the power of @xmath29 provides the best description of the data , we assumed that the final state parton distribution function has the same shape as the  invariant cross section and we found @xmath30=0.75@xmath310.05 . knowing , @xmath17 and @xmath19 and using ( [ eq_jt ] ) , ( [ eq_kt ] ) the  and  can be calculated .",
    "the results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown on .",
    "-0.5 cm the  and  values are extracted using `` fixed '' and `` assorted''-  correlation technique .",
    "the former method explores the correlation between particle pairs of the similar values of  and whereas the assorted method uses asymmetric pairs .",
    "the values of  in @xmath0 and @xmath1 data are in good agreement and the average value = 324@xmath316  mev / c ( = @xmath32=510@xmath3110  mev / c ) has been obtained .",
    "within the systematic and statistical errors it is not clear whether or not the  values follow the rising trend seen at lower energies @xcite . nonetheless , averaging the @xmath33 and @xmath34 data over  in case of @xmath0 data we found @xmath35=1.08@xmath310.05  gev / c ( @xmath35=@xmath36@xmath35=1.92@xmath310.09  gev / c ) and for @xmath1 data @xmath37=1.36@xmath310.07@xmath310.12  gev / c ( @xmath37=2.42@xmath310.12@xmath310.21  gev / c ) .    a similar analysis has been done also for @xmath2 data for various collision centralities , characterized by the average number of participants @xmath38 .",
    "we have studied the angular width and the associated yield per trigger particle for 2.5@xmath39@xmath394.0  and 1.0@xmath39@xmath392.5 . however , in this case , there is no justification of using @xmath40 extracted from @xmath0 data so we report only  ( see ) .",
    "whereas the  values shows essentially no dependence on @xmath41 , the away - side width and  reveals a rather dramatic raising trend compared to @xmath0 and @xmath1 indicating strong final state partons interaction with nuclear medium .",
    "-0.3 cm    -0.5 cm the associated near and away - side yields in @xmath2 are found to be rather constant or slightly rising with centrality in contrast of measurement done at higher -range @xcite .",
    "this observation seems to indicate strong jet rescattering rather than the full jet absorption in neclear medium ."
