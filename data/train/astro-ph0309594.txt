    "ly@xmath0 is the most prominent line feature in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of starburst galaxies , and so ly@xmath0 is often used as a redshift indicator . recently a large number of star - forming galaxies have been spectroscopically observed , either by using the lyman break method @xcite or by using gravitational lens @xcite .",
    "the detailed review was given by @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame uv spectra of those galaxies often show unique emission . in these cases",
    ", we usually identify this emission as ly@xmath0 , and use them as a redshift indicator .",
    "moreover , we propose that this unique feature has more sources of astrophysical information of those star - forming galaxies .",
    "ly@xmath0 profiles of starburst galaxies can be classified into three types : p - cygni type emission , broad absorption , and symmetric emission .",
    "the p - cygni type emission consists of absorption in red part and the asymmetric emission .",
    "however , the rest - frame uv continua of high-@xmath1 galaxies are often too weak to be detected , and so we can only see the asymmetric emission lines . the fraction of symmetric emission is small when compared with the other two types , and thus we will not go into detail of the symmetric type .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the kinematics of ambient material is crucial to determine whether emergent ly@xmath0 has either broad absorption or p - cygni type emission .",
    "p - cygni type ly@xmath0 emission can be seen only in those galaxies whose interstellar absorption lines are blueshifted with respect to either ly@xmath0 emission or stellar atmospheric lines .",
    "it seems to be a general consensus that outflowing motion is caused by either galactic superwind or galactic supershell @xcite .",
    "the formation of asymmetric ly@xmath0 by outflows was discussed qualitatively by @xcite .",
    "we study in this paper the formation of p - cygni type ly@xmath0 .",
    "ly@xmath0 radiative transfer is mainly achieved by back - scattering processes in outflowing media .",
    "we have studied the role of back - scattering processes in the formation of ly@xmath0 line profile @xcite .",
    "for the case of dust - free supershell , we found that a series of peaks appear in the red part of ly@xmath0 . in that paper",
    "we emphasized that the kinematic motion is imprinted on both the width of each peaks and the velocity difference between peaks .",
    "however , majority of the observed ly@xmath0 emission lines are dominantly singly peaked .",
    "possibly we can attribute this discrepancy to the previously neglected dust extinction in the radiative transfer .",
    "we study in this paper the ly@xmath0 line formation mechanism by interplay among the ly@xmath0 resonance scattering in optically thick supershell of neutral hydrogen , the spatial extension of dust in the hii bubble , and the kinematics of the supershell with respect to ly@xmath0 sources at the center of the supershell .",
    "galactic supershells are very well - known structures in the nearby starburst galaxies @xcite . their origin is known to be multiple explosions of the supernovae in active star - forming regions . in this paper",
    "we adopt a model galaxy of high-@xmath1 starburst galaxies in which ly@xmath0 sources are presumed to be located at a restricted part of the galaxy and surrounded by a dusty galactic supershell .",
    "the supershell is assumed to be made of uniform medium of neutral hydrogen and expanding in a bulk manner .",
    "we assume that the interior of the supershell is fully ionized , which is vacuum in the sense of ly@xmath0 scattering .",
    "the model in this study is very simple , and it has several model parameters .",
    "however , the main purpose of this paper is to emphasize the role of spatial distribution of dust in destroying the secondary and higher peaks .",
    "we will itemize and clarify the assumptions in this study as follows .    1 .",
    "the starbursting region is assumed to be localized in a region of the model galaxy .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that almost all the observed ly@xmath0 emission lines are asymmetric .",
    "if the galaxy were rotating and its star - forming regions are scattered along spiral arms , we might see symmetric ly@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "hence we can consider that the star - forming regions are localized in a rather narrow region in the galaxies .",
    "the hst images of about half of the lbgs show the amorphous shape of those high-@xmath1 galaxies , while the other half show the nuclear starburst @xcite . here",
    "we assume that even in the amorphous galaxies , only the brightest star - forming region is a dominant source of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the ionized inner part of the supershell can also be a source of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "however , the fraction of photons , generated in the ionized part of the supershell , is smaller than that of the stellar ly@xmath0 photons @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no kinematic difference between the photons back - scattered by the neutral supershell and the photons emitted by ionized supershell .",
    "hence we will neglect photons emitted from the ionized inner part of the supershell .",
    "we adopt a typical width of input ly@xmath0 profile @xmath2 in this paper . @xcite",
    "observed h@xmath0 emission of a nearby hii galaxy haro 2 .",
    "the h@xmath0 line width is @xmath3 which is equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "the input line width of ly@xmath0 affects the width of emergent emission peaks .",
    "however , it ranges between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite , which justifies our choice .",
    "4 .   the continuum is neglected in this paper . according to @xcite , the ly@xmath0 profiles for @xmath6 of their sample of lbgs consist of a combination of both emission and absorption .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of broad absorption is @xmath7 , which will be dumped in the red wing of the primary peak .",
    "however , those photons must be partially destroyed by dust extinction . moreover",
    ", dust - free galaxies would have ly@xmath0 equivalent widths of @xmath8 @xcite , which is much larger than the absorption ew of the continuum .",
    "hence we assume that the continuum will give a minor contribution .",
    "we also assume that the galactic supershell fully covers the starburst region , and that @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the outer radius of the supershell and @xmath11 is the inner radius of the supershell .",
    "we also assume that the hi column density outside the supershell is negligible , because the supershell is assumed to be of galactic scale .",
    "we adopt the column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath12 in accordance with voigt fittings done by @xcite .",
    "this column density corresponds to the line - center optical depth by @xmath13 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath14 is the doppler parameter corresponding to turbulence , which is typically @xmath15 for nearby hii galaxies @xcite .",
    "this gives us the voigt parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we also assumed for simplicity that the neutral hydrogen in the supershell is uniformly distributed .",
    "in fact , the supershell can either be patchy or have density gradient , which is also important for escape of lyman limit photons .",
    "the geometry of the supershell is assumed to be spherical for simplicity .",
    "the supershell evolves more rapidly toward the steepest density gradient @xcite , but it evolves to be of galactic scale .",
    "thus we can assume that the supershell is spherical .",
    "however , more work for complicated geometry can be expected in future work .",
    "we adopt the typical expansion velocity of the supershell @xmath17 . according to @xcite , the neutral gas in nearby starburst galaxies along the line of sight",
    "is being pushed by an expanding envelope around the hii region , outflowing at velocities close to @xmath18 . moreover , in the composite spectrum of high-@xmath1 galaxies , @xcite measured an average blueshift for the strong low - ionization interstellar features of @xmath19 with respect to the stellar systemic redshift .",
    "thus we adopt @xmath17 as a typical value . 9 .",
    "the bulk expansion is assumed , although there can be radial velocity gradient in the supershell .",
    "the real supershell must be complex , but we restrict the current scope of study within cases of bulk expansion . here",
    "the bulk expansion implies that dust and gas are also strongly coupled .",
    "we assume that dust is distributed uniformly in the ionized bubble , as well as within the supershell . when we let @xmath20 be the inner radius of the dust shell ,",
    "@xmath20 can be less than @xmath11 . the outer radius of dust shell is assumed to be equal to @xmath10 .",
    "although the dust size distribution and the number density are surely altered by the shock waves , we assume in this paper that they are same both in the ionized bubble and within the supershell .",
    "we defined a radial dust opacity through the dust shell @xmath21 , in order to reconcile with the usual way of estimating dust opacity by analyzing the extinction of the uv continuum from central stars in the central region of hii region .",
    "another important physical parameter related with dust abundance is dust - to - gas ratio . in particular , we define the dust - to - hi ratio in the neutral supershell by @xmath22 . here",
    "the typical mass of grains is defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the absorption cross - section of dust grains , @xmath25 is albedo , @xmath26 is the mass of hydrogen atom , and @xmath27 is the radius of dust grains effective at @xmath28 .",
    "we adopt the mass density of dust grains @xmath29 and the size of dust grain @xmath30 .",
    "we adopt the typical albedo @xmath31 in accordance with @xcite .",
    "we use the monte carlo method whose detailed description was presented in our previous papers @xcite . in the monte carlo code , we calculate the integrated path lengths of a ly@xmath0 photon before its escape only if the photon is passing through the dust shell . thus the integrated dust opacity experienced by the photon is given by @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is a path length in units of @xmath34 along which a ly@xmath0 photon propagates between the @xmath35-th scattering and the @xmath36-th scattering within the dust shell in @xmath37 .",
    "a more detailed description of the monte carlo code for dust - free supershell was given in @xcite .",
    "we present the emergent profiles which are calculated using the monte carlo method in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we can see that there are two peaks for each case , which is similar to our previous study @xcite .",
    "we call the peaks at @xmath38 the primary peaks , and the peaks at @xmath39 the secondary peaks .",
    "figure 1 show the emergent profiles for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "when we compare the left panels with @xmath42 to the right panels with @xmath43 , we can see that the secondary peaks are destroyed efficiently if the dust shell extends into the ionized bubble ( i.e. cases with @xmath42 ) .",
    "this fact means that the emergent ly@xmath0 photons , forming the peaks , have experienced almost the same amount of dust extinction , if dust is distributed only within the supershell .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "every back - scattering causes redshift of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "since the supershell is optically very thick , ly@xmath0 photons are back - scattered at the shallow inner part of the supershell .",
    "hence , the dust opacity contributed by path length within the supershell is relatively small , and the contribution during the final escape dominates the total dust opacity .",
    "hence , the total dust opacity for most of ly@xmath0 photons escaped after back - scattering becomes similar , which results in the inefficient decrease of secondary peaks .",
    "the situation becomes different when the dust shell extends into the ionized bubble , @xmath44 .",
    "while they are scattered back and forth in the bubble by back - scattering , the ly@xmath0 photons are redshifted and eventually escape to form the secondary and the tertiary peaks .",
    "thus , back - scattered ly@xmath0 photons have large path length within the dust shell in the ionized bubble .",
    "the dust opacity contributed by the dust shell within the ionized bubble is roughly proportional to the number of back - scattering .",
    "hence the secondary and the tertiary peaks are more rapidly decreased than the primary peak .",
    "the survival fraction of ly@xmath0 photons is mostly affected by the dust opacity within the supershell , which is determined by two factors ; one is the dust opacity within the supershell , and the other is the integrated path length within the supershell . according to theoretical researches @xcite , we usually call the medium extremely thick when @xmath45 . in this case , a ly@xmath0 photon experiences a large number of resonance core scattering , during which it happens to scatter with a hydrogen atom fastly moving at the tails of the boltzmann velocity distribution .",
    "then , the photon becomes a wing photon , for which the medium is transparent .",
    "the wing photon restores gradually to the core photon while it experiences a series of wing scattering , during which the photon wanders around the medium .",
    "this wandering can be regarded as a spatial diffusion , and can be described by random walk process .",
    "the photon has now core frequency again , and it repeats such processes .",
    "we call this one cycle an excursion . during such an excursion",
    ", ly@xmath0 can escape the medium . as a corollary ,",
    "ly@xmath0 photons suffer a larger amount of dust extinction either when the integrated path length of those photons within the supershell is increased or when the dust opacity within the supershell is very high .",
    "firstly , the dust opacity within the supershell is @xmath46 .",
    "thus , although the hi column densities are same , the dust opacity within the supershell increases as @xmath20 approaches to @xmath11 . as a result , in figure 3 , the survival fraction curves for @xmath43 are steeper than those for @xmath42 for cases with the same @xmath47 and @xmath14 .    secondly , as @xmath48 increases , both the number of wing scattering per excursions and the number of excursions within the supershell increases .",
    "hence , the path length within the supershell is an increasing function of @xmath48 . in figure 3 , for cases with the same doppler parameter @xmath49 , we can see that the curve with @xmath50 is decreased much faster than that with @xmath51 .",
    "thirdly , we know in section 2 that that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , @xmath54 .",
    "since the number of excursion within the supershell is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "we can expect that the destruction of the secondary and higher peaks is enhanced for small @xmath14 .",
    "we show in figure 2 the changes of profiles for different doppler widths , when both the column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath47 and the dust configuration ( or @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are same .",
    "the secondary peak is decreased more rapidly as @xmath14 is decreased .",
    "in addition , the width of the primary peaks decreases for small @xmath14 .",
    "the red part of the primary peak is formed of the photons which are scattered backward .",
    "those photons experiences dust extinction both within the supershell by resonance scattering and in the dust shell .",
    "thus they can be easily destroyed by dust during those scattering processes , and so the primary peak becomes narrow .",
    "we show in figure 3 the variation of survival fraction of ly@xmath0 photons for the cases of different doppler parameters , while @xmath47 , @xmath21 , and @xmath20 are same . when we compare the solid line with solid dots with the dotted line with solid dots",
    ", we can see that the curve for cases with small @xmath14 decreases rapidly .    on the other hand",
    ", we can see in figures 1 and 2 that both the widths of peaks and the velocity difference between peaks are largely insensitive to dust opacity .",
    "we showed that the kinematics of outflowing material is imprinted on both the velocity width of the peaks and the velocity differences between peaks @xcite .",
    "therefore , those characteristics can be used potentially to estimate the expansion velocity of the supershell even in dusty interstellar media .",
    "in this paper we emphasize that the spatial distribution of dust grains in the supershell is as important in forming the p - cygni type ly@xmath0 emission profiles as the kinematics of the supershell .",
    "the escape probability of ly@xmath0 photons is greatly enhanced when the supershell is expanding with respect to the central ly@xmath0 sources .",
    "that is , the ly@xmath0 resonance scattering is off - centered and the escape probability of ly@xmath0 photons is enhanced . as the number of back - scattering increases , ly@xmath0 photons are redshifted more and more , which enhances the escape probability .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are scattered backward by high hi column density of expanding supershell",
    ". therefore , in the cases of dust - free supershell , these back - scattering processes result in a series of peaks in the redward of ly@xmath0 .",
    "however , majority of observed ly@xmath0 emission show no such peaks . in this paper , we have found that the single peak can be formed , only when dust extends in the ionized bubble , as well as within the supershell . in this case , the integrated path length in dust shell increases as ly@xmath0 photons scatter back and forth by the shallow part of the inner wall of the supershell .",
    "thus , the integrated dust opacities increases as the inner radius of the dust shell decreases , which is main discovery of this study .",
    "moreover , when ly@xmath0 photons suffer a large number of resonance core scattering and wing scattering within the supershell , their path lengths become very large .",
    "thus , the dust opacity within the supershell is also one of decisive factor that determines the overall escapability of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "furthermore , both the optical depth and the doppler parameter of the supershell are another crucial factor to determine the survival fraction of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "we have found that the kinematic information of outflowing media surrounding ly@xmath0 sources is imprinted on the ly@xmath0 profiles , and it is conserved even when the medium is dusty .",
    "however , our model is very simplified one , whose limitation is described in section 2 in detail .",
    "more work is needed in the future .",
