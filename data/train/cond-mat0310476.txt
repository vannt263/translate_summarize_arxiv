    "advances in nanotechnology have lead to the fabrication of the devices which length - scales smaller than the mean free path of an electron .",
    "@xcite work in this direction as pushed the scale of an individual `` device '' to the molecular scale through reported measurements of electronic transport through carbon nanotubes , self - assembled monolayers of conjugated polymers , and indivisual molecules .",
    "@xcite moreover , there have been recent measurements of electrically induced light emission from individual single - walled carbon nanotubes  @xcite , as well as incredible progress towards the fabrication and synthesis of direct - bandgap nanowires and super - lattices with novel optical - electronic properties .    as this technology continues to press towards the molecular level , energy quantization , phase coherences , and electron - phonon coupling play increasingly important roles in the properties of the device .",
    "the central theme and challenge in designing molecular electronic components is the manipulation and control of charge flow through single molecules and molecular assemblages . predicting and understanding electronic current flow through molecular systems from an atomistic and first principles point of view presents a formidable theoretical challenge in that in requires the extension of standard quantum chemical methods that are well suited for bound state problems to solve non - stationary and many - body scattering in the continuum .",
    "the difficulty arises in how to impose open boundary conditions and steady flow - boundary conditions in a computationally feasible way .    by in large ,",
    "the theoretical description of charge transport in a molecular device can be cast in the language of quantum scattering theory in both time dependent and time - independent forms .",
    "the physical picture is that given by landauer  @xcite in which current through a molecular wire is generated by ballistic charge carriers scattering through the molecule .",
    "hence , conductivity is related to the transition matrix matrix , @xmath0 .",
    "for the time - independent case , the formal treatment involves the use of non - equilibrium keldysh - green function treatments to compute the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "@xcite within the `` scattering '' approach , one derives a self - energy contribution to the molecular hamiltonian due to the contact with the leads attached to the wire .",
    "this leads to a non - hermitian hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues .",
    "in contrast to the landauer approach , kosov@xcite establishes a molecular wire as a non - equilibrium steady - state system by appending a lagrange multiplier to the molecular hamiltonian to constrain the current passing through the system to be some desired value . as a consequence ,",
    "the modified hamiltonian remains hermitian , continuity is rigorously enforced , and the bias is determined as the difference between the fermi energies of the system under forward and reverse current .    in this work ,",
    "we focus upon electronic transport through semiconducting systems where coulomb interaction and electron correlation effects become important .",
    "we address the issue of current due to photoexcitation of a conjugated polymer `` wire '' .",
    "we focus on the case where the bias applied to the semiconductor is insufficient to produce current so that all of the charge - carriers in the system are due to the photo - excitation process .",
    "we adopt the newn - anderson  @xcite model for a two band - semiconducting polymer wire and use this description to compute the current response of the wire .",
    "we consider here a rather idealized scenario in which an @xmath1-site polymer chain bridging two metal electrodes .",
    "this is idealized in the generic sense because in the majority of photo - current experiments , the polymer chromophores in the sample are either randomly distributed in the sample or have more or less random orientation with respect to the applied bias field .",
    "moreover , with the exception of experiments on single molecules or molecules oriented on a surface , the molecules themselves are not chemically bound to the electrodes .",
    "nonetheless , we recognize these as possible limitations of our theoretical model .",
    "the formalism we give here is adapted from the typical single - particle perspective for the case of electron / hole interactions . by assuming that the coupling to the continuum is a single - particle interaction ,",
    "we can adopt a general scattering - theory perspective to describe current producing state in the presence of electron / hole excitations .",
    "to begin , we partition the state space of our system into three domains , @xmath2 and @xmath3 which span the states of the left and right electrodes and @xmath4 which spans the electronic states of the bridging molecule and be projected into separate fock spaces representing different total numbers of elementary electron / hole excitations .",
    "@xmath5 thus , the full hamiltonian has the structure @xmath6 where the diagonal terms are the hamiltonians for the uncoupled subsystems and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the interactions between the polymer and the left and right electrodes",
    ". we will assume that number of excitations within the total system is conserved so that @xmath7 and @xmath8 can not couple different polymer fock spaces and are thus single particle ( electron or hole ) operators .",
    "thus , within the space of single excitations , the polymer hamilton is given by@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is mono - excited electron / hole configuration , @xmath11 is the two - particle matrix - element , and @xmath12 is the matrix of the one - particle band - structure operator , @xmath13 ( which also includes any external field bias ) . in the absence of the electrodes ,",
    "this is given by @xmath14 when the coupling to the electrodes is introduced , these terms need to be modified to include the one - particle polymer - electrode coupling . for this",
    "we need to make a number of assumptions regarding the form of this coupling .",
    "first , we assume that the polymer - electrode coupling occurs only at the terminal sites of the polymer . @xmath15 using the feshbach method  @xcite and assuming that the density of states of the electrodes is that of a 3d metal , we can derive reduced one - particle matrix elements , @xmath16 for the terminal sites of the polymer . @xmath17",
    "with the remaining terms left unmodified .",
    "@xmath18 is the complex ( retarded ) self - energy contribution from the electrodes .",
    "( note : @xmath19 is the advanced self - energy . ) for these , we adopt the newns - anderson  @xcite model and write @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the `` injection energy '' for an electron ( or hole ) to tunnel between the metal and the polymer measured relative to a common fermi energy , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the band - width of the metal reservoir , and @xmath24 is the chemisorption coupling between the polymer and electrode .",
    "this system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] . for a metal / polymer contact , we take @xmath25 ev as the band - width of the electrode and with a chemisorption coupling of @xmath26ev . for the unbiased case ,",
    "the injection energy for an electron or a hole is half the band - gap of the polymer , @xmath27ev for ppv so that both the bonding and anti - bonding orbitals of the @xmath28-electron system fall into the band - width of the metal .",
    "thus , @xmath29 and we can approximate the retarded self energy as @xmath30 which indicates that the coupling to the electrode should produce only a minor perturbation to the real energy of the system and that its only effect is to provide a sink for the e / h excitation to decay . we will also assume throughout that the applied bias is insufficient to cause direct current flow through the system .",
    "the newns - anderson model was also used by mujica _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the description of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) current in molecular imaging of one - dimensional systems to encompass the more general process of electron transfer between two reservoirs .",
    "our primary assumption throughout is that the self - energy contribution is a single - particle term .",
    "thus , we can include the effect of the coupling to the metal leads into a configuration interaction theory by including this term in the generation of the fock - matrix @xmath31 where @xmath32 were @xmath33 is the injection energy for an electron ( + ) or hole ( - ) onto the terminal site in the absence of an applied bias and @xmath34 is the shift of the bare site energy due to the applied field .",
    "for this we take the fermi energy of the system as a common reference . including the self - energy into mix produces a non - hermitian complex symmetric ci hamiltonian which can be diagonalized via unitary transformation yielding complex eigenvalues",
    ", @xmath35 , @xmath36    since the polymer / electrode interaction is at the terminal ends and only involves single - electron terms , we have an exact relation between the net electron / hole population for a given ci state on the terminal sites and complex energy shift component of the ci eigenvalue , @xmath37 where the real energy shift and imaginary energy are related to the real and imaginary components of the self - energy , @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 where , @xmath40 are the populations of the electron or hole on the terminal ( i.e. right and left ) ends of the polymer .",
    "in essence , eigenstates with more total electron or hole population on the terminal sites are more coupled to the metal continuum than eigenstates with less amplitude on the terminal sites .     under 0.03ev / unit bias.,width=336 ]",
    "once we have obtained the complex - eigenspectrum , we can construct the retarded greens function for e / h scattering through the molecule .",
    "@xmath41 because @xmath42 is _ not _ a hermitian operator , its eigenvectors do not form a orthogonal set and we need to compute the eigenspectrum of the adjoint matrix @xmath43 taken together , the eigenvectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 form a bi - orthogonal set @xmath46 consequently , the retarded greens function is constructed via @xmath47 in a similar vein , the spectral response , which gives the generalized density of states inside the polymer taking the contact with the metallic continuum into account is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy broadening taken as as the difference between the retarded and advanced self - energies @xmath50 pulling these two together yields the usual expression @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the `` bare '' ci eigenvalue of @xmath53 in the absence of the metal contact .",
    "lastly , the density of states is given by the trace of @xmath54 , @xmath55 thus , each ci state in becomes broadened by the contact with the metal implying that the states take on a finite life - time in addition to being displaced in energy .",
    "in the case of weak interaction , @xmath56 and the `` lorentzian '' describing the spectral contribution from the @xmath57 state collapses to a @xmath58-function . the density of states for a 32-repeat unit model of ppv under 0.03ev / unit bias is shown in fig .",

    "the six circled energies correspond to the lowest energy dipole state ( d ) , exciton ( xt ) , and charge transfer ( ct ) state for either chain .",

    "[ energies ] we compare the distribution of the real and imaginary components of the singlet sci states for a ppv polymer chain of 48 and 32 repeat units with a bias potential of 0.03ev / unit cell .",
    "this corresponds to a macroscopic field of @xmath63 which is on - par with the fields placed across actual devices .",
    "the shading of each point in the figure reflects the net charge on the terminal ends of the molecule with white or red circles indicating no net charge on the terminal site .",
    "also indicated on this plot are a set of energies we will associate with the lowest exciton ( xt ) , the lowest energy pure charge transfer state where the electron and hole do not reside on the same repeat unit ( ct ) , and a `` dipole '' state ( d ) in which the electron and hole are localized on opposite ends of the chain .     at 0.03ev / unit bias .",
    "the energies for these states are circled on fig .",
    "[ energies],width=336 ]    we see that the energies of the lowest energy excitonic state are identical for both chains at 2.5ev as is the location of lowest pure charge - transfer state at about 2.9ev .",
    "both of these sets of states are indicated by circles on fig .",
    "[ energies ] .",
    "what is interesting in this regard is that there appears to be a progression of purely excitonic states intersecting a progression of charge - separated states .",
    "this progression of excitonic states are simply the center - of - mass translational eigenstates of the lowest energy bound electron / hole state .",
    "even though the exciton states acquire quite large ( in comparison ) imaginary energy components indicating that the life - time of the states steadily decrease as energy increases , they remain relatively unpolarized by the applied field . as we shall demonstrate next , the current produced by a given excitation",
    "is determined by both the size of the imaginary energy components and by the net charge on the terminal ends of the molecule .",
    "consequently , the excitonic states will contribute very little to the current where as the charge - transfer states will give the dominant contribution .    in fig .",
    "[ distrib ] we plot the xt , d , and first two ct states for the 32 unit chain . here",
    ", the exciton is more or less unperturbed by the applied field and is more or less identical to the exciton for the polymer in the absence of the field . for the dipole state ( d ) , the electron and hole are localized on the opposite ends of the polymer . for the 32 unit chain , @xmath64 ; however , for the 48-unit chain the dipole state is considerably lower in energy than the xt .",
    "the energy of this state should scale almost linearly with chain size since to lowest order approximation @xmath65 as per a dipole in an electric field",
    ". the ct states shown in fig .",
    "[ distrib ] are tunneling states from a bound ct state ( i.e. the @xmath66 ) into the continuum .",
    "in fact this entire picture can be rationalized in a simple one - dimensional model of the unimolecular decay of a bound electron / hole state as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "state moves farther to the right and lower in energy whereas the xt and ct remain more or less unchanged .",
    ", width=336 ]      if we consider the net flow of charge from the molecule following promotion to some state @xmath67 , we need to be cognizant of the fact that even though the lifetime of the state is given by @xmath68 , this represents only the net decay of the electron / hole excitation from the molecule into the metal since there is an equal influx and efflux of charge to and from the molecule . in other words ,",
    "the current produced by a given state is not simply proportional to the rate of decay of the state into the continuum .",
    "furthermore , in the limit that the valance and conduction bands have identical interaction with the metal ( as in the case at hand ) no net charging of the molecule can occur as a result of contact with the metal .",
    "hence , total charge @xmath69 on the molecule must remain a constant of the motion . since @xmath70",
    ", one is tempted to conclude @xmath71 .",
    "however , the net current should be taken as the difference between its retarded and advanced components .",

    "the bias produces current in the opposite direction since the current producing charge - transfer states will be polarized in the reverse direction .     at 0.03ev / unit bias .",
    "here we show both the natural line - widths of the current resulting from a single chain and the inhomogeneously broadened current response . in this case",
    ", the effect of the field is to shift the lowest current producing state below the lowest energy exciton so that current is produced without any excess photon energy above the state optically coupled to the ground state .",
    ", width=336 ]    in fig.[current48 ] we show the current response for a given excitation energy as well as the optical response for @xmath59 under 0.03ev / unit bias . from the way we have defined the direction of the current , a negative response indicates current in the forward direction ,",
    "i.e. electrons flowing from the @xmath76 to @xmath77 ends and holes flowing @xmath77 to @xmath76 .",
    "a zero response indicates that the electron current exactly balances the hole current , so no net charge flows through the system as a result of excitation . at roughly 5.5 ev ( center of the single - excitation band )",
    "the current response passes through zero and we see current going against the direction of the bias field as the energy increases .",
    "since this is well above the optical response of the system which peaks at about 2.5 ev , this reverse current most likely would not be observed in any molecular system .",
    "finally we turn our attention towards what happens to the induced current as a function of applied field . in fig .",
    "[ field ] we show the current response for a 32-unit chain under 0.01 ev / unit and 0.03ev / unit bias and the corresponding complex ci energies in fig .  [ field2 ] .",
    "first we note that the on - set of current shifts towards higher energies upon going from 0.03ev / unit to 0.01 ev / unit .",
    "this is commensurate with the fact that as the field decreases , there is proportionally less stark shifting of the dipole states .",
    "consequently , at low field we have fewer potential current producing states at lower energies compared to the higher field case .",
    "on the other hand , the xt states remain completely unperturbed by the change in field . at lower field ,",
    "the lowest ct states have smaller imaginary energies than at high - field .",
    "again , this is consistent with our reduced one dimensional model in fig .",
    "[ model ] : lower - fields produce less tunneling between the ct states and the continuum .",
    "in two different applied fields ( 0.01ev / unit and 0.03 ev / unit ) .",

    "in this paper we have laid a theoretical ground - work for the study of current producing states in molecular semiconductors focusing solely up current produced upon electronic excitation . in a subsequent works , we will address the issue of dc and ac conductivity in molecular semiconductors , especially those in which half of the molecule is more electron rich than the other .",
    "such model pn - junctions have been produced synthetically @xcite and we have recently studied the electro - luminescence of such systems.@xcite    needless to say , there are several lacuna in our treatment that will need to be systematically addressed .",
    "first , we assume that the electric field across the molecule is uniform . in realistic systems , this may not be the case and one really should self - consistently solve the poisson equation for the field taking into account the actual charge distribution of the molecule and the appropriate boundary conditions imposed by the conducting leads .",
    "similarly , the model fails to account for the image charges between the polymer and metal contact .",
    "both of these effects require more detailed dynamical interactions between the metal leads and the polymer than is accounted for in the present model .",
    "secondly , we do not currently account for lattice excitations or distortions due to the applied field or the current through the system .",
    "the current response as we have defined it , simply gives the coherent ballistic current produced at some energy @xmath21 above the hf ground state .",
    "we are currently working to extend this to finite temperature by the inclusion of phonon creation and annihilation channels .    in spite of these shortcomings ,",
    "the basic physical picture offered by this model is quite appealing .",
    "first of all , it emphasizes the fact that different electron / hole states have widely differing capacities for producing current following a given excitation .",
    "possessing a large imaginary energy alone is insufficient to produce current .",
    "the state must also be sufficiently polarized so that there is adequate charge separation .",
    "this raises another crucial aspect in trying to use this model to understand photocurrent in bulk systems .",
    "that is , states with large dipole moments will be poorly coupled to the ground state via optical excitation .",
    "consequently , direct excitation from the ground state to a strongly current producing state is highly unlikely .",
    "what is more likely is that following photo - excitation to some higher - lying eigenstate , phonon creation kicks in and induces transitions between the initial state and lower energy electronic states including those capable of producing current ."
