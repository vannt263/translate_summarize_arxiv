    "how exotic is exotic matter ?",
    "do young and old galaxies harbor exotic matter ?",
    "so far there has been no simple or advanced theory about exotic matter nor a prediction and all we know about it is its mathematical definition : it violates our perception of energy . that is ,",
    "if an observer measures some negative local amount of energy density , we say that that corresponds to exotic matter .",
    "the other thing we know about exotic matter is its possible wormhole sustainability  @xcite .",
    "while they are of exotic nature , wormholes may interact with ordinary matter and may be indirectly observed through the effects they have on light and particle paths as well as on fields  @xcite , on falling hot objects and spots  @xcite and so on .",
    "the field equations of classical general relativity do not fix the topology of its solutions nor do they fix the amount of exotic matter needed to sustain the throat of a wormhole . quantum effects allow for violations of the local and averaged  @xcite null energy condition ( nec ) and might be used to support and stabilize wormholes .    since",
    "exotic matter remains still a mystery , workers , using different techniques , have ever strived hard to derive wormhole solutions that minimize its use  @xcite and  @xcite-@xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no classification of wormholes has been performed so far .",
    "observers of events are usually located far away from the sources , say , at spatial infinity , where observable entities may behave differently .",
    "the only distinctions among wormholes , which are widely used by workers , are finiteness of the mass , traversability , and stability .",
    "other observable entities that may distinguish between wormholes are the components of the stress energy tensor ( set ) .",
    "it is the duty of this paper to perform this classification based on the relative behavior of the components of the set at spatial infinity .",
    "another , but implicit , classification of wormholes concerns redshift - free wormholes and wormholes endowed with it .",
    "the radial and transverse pressures of redshift - free wormholes , with positive energy density and finite mass , behave the same way at spatial infinity , so there is no classification added for these solutions .",
    "this fact could be announced as a uniqueness theorem .",
    "this is no longer the case for wormholes endowed with redshift effects where three types of solutions , having finite mass , emerge .",
    "the classification of wormholes motivates a new mathematical quest for theoretical wormholes fueled by the recent activities  @xcite to whether the observations of the shadow or hot spots are able to distinguish between a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , located at sagittarius a@xmath3 ( sgr a@xmath3 ) , and a supermassive wormhole ( smwh ) . questioning if the smbh candidate at the center of the milky way is a smwh is right but trying to answer it is hard .",
    "in fact , we have noticed that the wormhole solutions used in these investigations are the types that demand the most exotic matter . we will show that it is possible , without using the cut and paste technique , to construct their counterparts which violate the least the nec and yield a value @xmath4 for the diameter of the shadow .",
    "this is the same value derived very recently  @xcite , using the millimeter - wavelength very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "the image of the emission surrounding the smbh candidate in the center of the milky way reveals , at 1.3 mm vlbi , the same features of general relativity including that of a shadow of diameter @xmath5 . knowing that sgr a@xmath3 along with m87 are on the list of the main targets of the event horizon telescope  @xcite",

    "[ secs ] we consider redshift - free static wormholes and construct by a new procedure some new exact solutions .",
    "those redshift - free wormholes , with positive energy density , have one of their barotropic equations of state in the phantom regime ( at least in the region adjacent to the throat ) , have their stress energy tensor traceless , and are anisotropic . in sec .  [ secr ]",
    "we focus more on solutions with variable redshift function and constant finite mass .",
    "we classify them into three types i , ii , and iii .",
    "type i ( respectively type iii ) wormholes violate the least ( respectively the most ) the lec s .",
    "the importance of type i and type iii solutions is that they can be used by distant observers for testing hypotheses and in computer simulations .",
    "we introduce a 3-parameter approach to derive , without gluing , a class of each of the three wormhole types .",
    "the approach splits into two directions , in the one of which only one parameter remains free , and in the other one two parameters remain free to confine the exotic matter .",
    "we discuss the violations of the lec s and traversability .",
    "[ secsd ] is devoted to an application .",
    "first , we show that the wormhole solution that has been used  @xcite for evaluating the shadow of the smbh candidate is type iii .",
    "we use , instead , a type i solution and show that the evaluation of the shadow is inconclusive .",
    "said otherwise , the outcome of the observation is such that ( a ) the candidate might either be a ( or kerr ) smbh or a type i smwh , ( b ) the candidate is a type iii smwh with relatively large amounts of exotic matter in the center of the galaxy . based on the recent results of ref  @xcite , this last possibility is ruled out .    in sec .",
