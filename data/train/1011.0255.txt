    "( inter chain ) with ( a ) the free boundary condition and ( b)the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the lattice structure is shown in the inset of ( a ) . ]    finally , we briefly examine a quasi-1d system , the zigzag chain with interchain couplings .",
    "the lattice structure is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ q1d](a ) , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the hopping and exchange energies , respectively , between zigzag chains .",
    "we calculated the ground - state phase diagrams for the free and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ q1d](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we have chosen the interchain couplings as @xmath125 , which is much smaller than @xmath126 , the energy of a typical intrachain coupling .",
    "we see a @xmath18 phase around @xmath127 .",
    "the phase particularly for the free boundary condition is of a shape similar to those for the pure 1d and 2d cases , and also survives for the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the result shows that the hole - spin bound state is stable for the interchain couplings .",
    "experimentally , it extends the possibility of synthesizing materials which include the present hole - spin bound state .",
    "we notice that there is no fully polarized ferromagnetic phase in the phase diagrams .",
    "the effect of nagaoka ferromagnetism@xcite produced by one hole motion can not overcome the effect of the antiferromagnetic interaction with small @xmath124 which is finitely fixed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in summary , we investigated the bound state of a hole and a triplet spin in the 1d and 2d @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 models by the numerical diagonalization method . in the one - hole case , we confirmed that a large phase with total spin @xmath18 exists in the @xmath2-@xmath1 phase diagram for several system sizes under the free and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the existence of the large @xmath18 phase indicates the existence and stability of the hole - spin bound state .",
    "we examined features of the hole - spin bound state by the hole - spin and density - density correlation functions .",
    "in the two - hole case , calculation of a specially defined spin density function showed that two holes are repulsive to each other .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the hole - spin bound state behaves as a tightly bounded composite particle and moves almost freely from the other hole - spin bound states .",
    "we finally aim to establish that hole - spin bound states are generally formed and behave as quasiparticles in various strongly repulsive electron systems on lattices consisting of triangle units .",
    "actually , in this paper , we investigated the issue by using the 1d and 2d @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 models as typical cases .",
    "also the present arguments are based on numerical calculations with relatively small numbers of electrons and the dimensionality is less than 3 due to the limitation of the calculations .",
    "hence , the present results are not general .",
    "however , we have obtained many substantial evidences , which are consistent with each other , for the formation of the hole - spin bound state .",
    "it is plausible that the hole - spin bound state is a bosonic quasiparticle with charge @xmath4 @xmath128 . actually , the motion of the hole - spin bound state is equivalent to a collective back - flow motion of surrounding singlet electron pairs which are bosonic . also a whole triplet electron pair as well as a whole singlet electron pair does not move with the hole for long distances due to the dense electrons with infinite on - site repulsions .",
    "hence only a moving charge is @xmath4 of the hole and not @xmath129 of the triplet pair near the hole .",
    "the hole - spin bound state consists only of a hole and a spin-1 degree of freedom in the electrons . according to this picture",
    ", a superconductivity may occur as the bec of the quasiparticles of the hole - spin bound states at low temperatures .",
    "the supercurrent is then carried by the quasiparticles with charge @xmath4 and spin 1 .",
    "thus we have come close to a possible exotic superconductivity of charge @xmath4 .    in the case of no hole",
    ", the bec of massive magnons is argued .",
    "oosawa et al .",
    "reported a field - induced magnetic ordering in tlcucl@xmath130 , which is described by a quasi-1d zigzag spin system.@xcite the ordering is explained by the bec of massive magnons under strong magnetic field.@xcite in contrast , we argued the bec of charged particles with spin 1 in no magnetic field .",
    "then the present bec means a superconductivity .",
    "we expect that this type of bec is realized in hole - doped spin - gapped materials with lattices where the triangle effect works .",
    "the numerical computation in this work was partially carried out using the facilities of information technology center , nagoya university ."
