    "single - photon detectors ( spds ) have been utilized in a number of space applications , including laser ranging ( lidar ) for atmospheric and topology measurements of the earth @xcite , elementary particle scintillation detectors @xcite , and precise laser time transfer @xcite .",
    "spds will also be necessary to support quantum communication applications @xcite , where high detection efficiency , low timing jitter , low dark count rate ( dcr ) and low afterpulsing probability are key parameters for achieving successful , high - fidelity transmissions @xcite .",
    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) and silicon avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) are two types of spds that generally have good performance for this application , whereas superconducting nano - wire detectors may offer better performance , in some respects , at the cost of being significantly less practical , requiring cryogenic cooling @xcite .    for optical transmissions through the atmosphere ,",
    "a low - loss window exists at around 800  nm wavelength  @xcite .",
    "pmts have reduced detection efficiencies for wavelengths longer than 650  nm , but silicon - based apds have high detection efficiency in that region , low timing jitter , low dcr , and low afterpulsing , making them a prime candidate technology for quantum communication applications .",
    "however , incident radiation significantly increases the dcr of apds @xcite , which can quickly turn an apd unsuitable for quantum communications on a space platform .",
    "successful ground - to - satellite quantum communication requires each detector s dcr to be kept below about @xmath3 counts per second ( cps )  @xcite .",
    "previous use of silicon apd technology ( specifically , excelitas slik devices ) for photon detection on a satellite showed an increase in dark count rates by @xmath4  cps for each day in orbit  @xcite , which would make them unusable for quantum communications in merely a few weeks .",
    "other ground - based radiation tests of apds also demonstrated dcrs too high for quantum communications @xcite .",
    "recently reported tests attempted mitigation by cooling to temperatures as low as @xmath5 to overcome the increased dcr  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the dcr of non - irradiated apds can be reduced by deeper cooling , decreasing the rate of thermally induced spontaneous avalanches @xcite , but at the same time cooling increases the lifetimes of trapped carriers that contribute to afterpulsing , which may interfere with quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "thermal annealing was also found to reduce the dcr after irradiation  @xcite .",
    "however , no previously reported tests have applied deep cooling to radiation damaged apds , nor have any demonstrated a sufficiently low dcr required for quantum communications , specifically quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , or verified other detector parameters throughout a reasonable lifetime ( e.g. , 1 year for an initial demonstrator mission ) of a quantum receiver satellite .    here",
    "we show experimentally that the effects of radiation doses equivalent to as much as 2 years in low - earth orbit are successfully mitigated by cooling and thermal annealing , allowing apds to be used in a quantum satellite .",
    "we have tested three apd device models  excelitas c30921sh and laser components sap500s2 ( each with sensitive areas 500   in diameter ) , and excelitas slik ( with sensitive area 180   in diameter)and one pmt device model  hamamatsu h7422p-40 .",
    "all samples survived irradiation and remained functional photon detectors , with the only significant effect being the increase of the dcr in all apd samples .",
    "breakdown voltage , afterpulsing , detection efficiency and timing jitter of the irradiated apds were characterized and shown to be in the range acceptable for quantum communications .",
    "pmts were also tested for dark counts , timing jitter , afterpulsing and detection efficiency .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in [ sec : test ] we describe how the equivalent radiation doses for devices under test were calculated , the design of our setup and the radiation test procedure . in [ sec : effects ] we present the measured radiation damage effects , and in [ sec : mitigation ] we demonstrate results of cooling and annealing on irradiated apds .",
    "we finally give concluding remarks in [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "spds in low - earth orbit experience space radiation primarily in the form of protons , electrons and heavy ions , resulting in two types of permanent damage in the semiconductor material : displacement and ionization damage @xcite .",
    "apds are less sensitive to ionization damage ; e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that after 1-year equivalent ionization damage ( in a 800  km equatorial orbit ) si apds increased dcrs up to 2 times .",
    "however , displacement damage causes new defects in the semiconductor lattice of the active area , significantly affecting the dcr ; e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite dcr of apd irradiated by protons increased by one to two orders of magnitude ( limited by a saturated passive quenching window comparator ) .",
    "dark current in apds has two components : surface currents , which are unaffected by gain , and bulk leakage current which passes through the avalanche region and is therefore gain multiplied .",
    "bulk dark current generation is linked directly to non - ionizing energy loss in a variety of silicon semiconductors @xcite .",
    "ionization damage is mainly associated with surface oxide interface dark current , and was not directly considered in this study .",
    "afterpulsing is caused by delayed emission of trapped charge from bulk defects , in a thermally activated process ( analogous to charge transfer efficiency losses in charge - coupled devices ) .",
    "proton displacement damage arises due to structural displacements in the silicon crystal caused by elastic collisions , and inelastic spallation reactions .",
    "the distribution of energies of trapped protons in low - earth orbit , transported through 10  mm of aluminum shielding , possesses a broad peak in the range of 50 to 75  mev . here the ratio between elastic and inelastic energy loss ranges from 1.7 to 1.2 , whereas at 100  mev the ratio is roughly 1.0 . following a commonly accepted silicon damage deposition model @xcite , we calculated the monochromatic proton fluence that produces the same average specific non - ionizing energy loss in silicon",
    ".    due to this difference in the energy distribution ratio , the physical range of damage fragments through the sensitive microvolume of the detector will also be different , because inelastic reactions result in a much greater variance in the range of fragments in the silicon , compared to elastic damage which is uniformly distributed throughout .",
    "( that is , the damage energy equilibrium may not be established until several micrometers below the si surface from the direction of incident proton flux . )",
    "this would result in under - dosing of the first few micrometers near the surface of the apd  at 100  mev , damage equilibrium is not reached until about @xmath6 to @xmath7 beneath the surface @xcite . however , ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows the internal structure of different types of apd , suggests that the important amplification region is typically tens of micrometers below the surface , where these small damage energy distribution differences will not be a major factor .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we chose a polar orbit at 600  km altitude , providing global coverage , as representative for our hypothetical quantum satellite . with a hypothetical",
    "shielding of 10-mm - thick aluminum around its detectors , predicted radiation doses were calculated using the spenvis radiation modeling tool for durations of 0.6  months , 6  months , 12  months and 24  months .",
    "the radiation doses were determined to be equivalent to 100  mev proton fluences of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    ".[table : table_groups]nine groups of tested samples and their corresponding nominal radiation fluences , equivalent to in - orbit exposures over 0.6  months , 6  months , 12  months and 24  months with protons at @xmath12 .",
    "each apd in group 5 was biased during irradiation at 20  v above its breakdown voltage .",
    "group 9 was not irradiated , and kept as a control . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : table_pmt_dcr ] shows the measured properties of the pmts .",
    "in general , dcrs increased noticeably and exceeded the 200  cps desired for qkd .",
    "anomalously , however , the pmt under the highest fluence experienced a dcr increase of merely 43% . given that this sample also exhibited 166% afterpulsing probability prior to irradiation ( and 45% afterwards ) , it seems that the device may be defective and its properties unrepresentative .",
    "( although , owing to a lack of time , the pmts were not aged prior to the experiment , as is recommended by hamamatsu .",
    "this resulted in generally elevated afterpulsing probabilities before irradiation . )",
    "dcrs as presented in [ table : table_pmt_dcr ] were measured at 19 days after irradiation .",
    "a second dcr measurement was also performed 27 days after irradiation , where it was observed to have decreased by 10 to 25% since the first measurement , possibly due to self - annealing , despite the pmts being kept in a freezer at @xmath13 .",
    "cooling effect on dcrs of group 4 ( 24  month equivalent dose ) .",
    "pre - irradiation data are connected with dashed lines , post - irradiation with solid lines , and the control group with dotted lines .",
    "dcrs decrease with temperature exponentially for irradiated and non - irradiated samples . ]",
    "measurements of the detection properties of the samples reveal that radiation - induced dcrs decrease with temperature exponentially for all irradiated apds , following the same trend as for non - radiated apds . for sliks from group 4 ,",
    "irradiated with a 24-month - in - orbit equivalent dose , dcr dropped to 200  cps at about @xmath14 ( see [ fig : darks_vs_temp ] ) .",
    "the breakdown voltage , efficiency , and timing jitter demonstrated no significant change , though the afterpulsing probability increased significantly as lower temperatures prolonged the release of trapped carriers @xcite .",
    "the maximum afterpulsing probabilities in group  4 measured at @xmath0 are 2.7% for sliks , 31% for sap500s2 , and 1.7% for c30921s2 .",
    "although afterpulsing is higher , we can conclude that , given sufficient cooling , slik spds can serve well for quantum protocols even after 24  months in orbit .",
    "notably , the required temperatures are significantly above those typically reached by cryogenic coolers , and though the cooling necessary might represent a significant power demand on a small satellite system , it is nevertheless achievable . in a larger satellite or an orbital station it could be easily implemented , e.g. ,  by using solid - state thermoelectic coolers ( tecs ) .",
    "we applied thermal annealing to all our irradiated apd samples except those in group 2 ( which were set aside for laser annealing tests taking place separately  @xcite ) .",
    "samples were left at room temperature ( @xmath15 ) and in a hot - air - flow oven at @xmath1 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for various lengths of time . after a week of annealing at room temperature",
    "there was an observed decrease of dcr , down to a factor relative to pre - annealing rates as low as 0.57 for sap500s2 samples , and 0.71 for slik samples . while interesting , this rate of improvement is almost certainly too slow to be useful on a satellite platform .",
    "dcrs measured at @xmath5 after annealing of apds from group 3 at @xmath18 over 1  h , at @xmath19 over 45  min , and for slik samples after further annealing at @xmath2 over 8  h. dcrs of all apds decrease significantly during 45  minutes of @xmath19 annealing , and continue to decrease for a slik during @xmath2 annealing , through the dcr of one of the two sliks increased during last 4  hours . ]",
    "dcrs measured at @xmath5 after annealing of apds from group 4 at @xmath19 over 4  h , followed by annealing at @xmath2 over 1  h. the most significant decrease of dcrs for all apds occurred during the first hour of @xmath19 annealing , but dcrs still continued to improve with additional annealing . ]",
    "all oven - annealed apds demonstrated more significant decreases of dcrs , with the most improvement achieving a factor 0.15 times the original pre - annealing dcr for a slik apd from group 3 annealed at @xmath1 , @xmath16 and @xmath2 ( see [ fig : annealing_gr3])almost a full order of magnitude dcr improvement .",
    "sap500s2 samples saw factors as low as 0.28 , and c30921sh as low as 0.3 , compared to pre - annealing dcrs , both from group 4 annealed at @xmath16 and @xmath2 ( see [ fig : annealing_gr4 ] ) .    instead of the oven , we utilized in - built tecs for annealing of sliks from group 3 at @xmath2 , as this approach has the potential to simplify annealing within orbit conditions . to achieve @xmath2 at the sensitive area",
    "while the package is at room temperature , a slik s tec consumes 0.41   of electrical power .",
    "the total annealing time with tecs was 8  h. one of the sliks demonstrated steady improvement of the dark count rate during that time , though the second slik showed some degradation after 4  h of annealing ( [ fig : annealing_gr3 ] ) .",
    "breakdown voltage , detection efficiency , afterpulsing and timing response jitter of all apds demonstrated no notable change after thermal annealing .",
    "we have conducted radiation tests of 32 apd ( excelitas and laser components ) and 4 pmt ( hamamatsu ) spd devices , with radiation levels equivalent to lifetimes in low - earth 600  km polar orbit of 0.6  months , 6  months , 12  months and 24  months .",
    "our performance characterization measurements showed a significant increase in dcrs for all apd devices , while there was no measurable radiation - induced degradation in the photon detection efficiency and timing jitter , and only a small increase in the afterpulsing probability .",
    "all apd samples demonstrated a significant increase in dcr due to radiation , increasing the dcr by many orders of magnitude , well above the maximum 200  cps or so required for quantum communications tasks .",
    "subsequently , we have experimentally demonstrated that radiation damage can be successfully mitigated by sufficient cooling . for excelitas slik devices , cooling to @xmath0 was sufficient to restore the dcr to below the 200  cps level that would make quantum communications possible , even after 24-month - equivalent radiation dose .    further dcr reduction ( while preserving other performance properties )",
    "was obtained through thermal annealing .",
    "apd devices were heated at @xmath1 to @xmath2 over a few hours , in the best case resulting in a dcr only @xmath20 times that prior to annealing .",
    "it is worth noting that this approach can reduce the amount of cooling power required to reach the targeted low dcr ",
    ",  following annealing , the slik apds could achieve the target dcr of 200  cps at about @xmath21 , @xmath22 higher than prior to annealing .",
    "thermal annealing at @xmath16 to @xmath2 seems to be the most effective , but some additional tests are required to optimize the thermal annealing for radiation damaged apds .",
    "results from the pmt samples indicated small ( but still significant ) degradation in dcr and almost no degradation in any other measured property ( efficiency , timing jitter , and afterpulsing probability ) after applied radiation .",
    "this makes them a tantalizing candidate , particularly for optical inter - satellite communication applications .",
    "however , as their peak efficiency is at wavelengths where atmospheric losses are higher , they remain less interesting for ground  satellite links .",
    "we note that , while thermal annealing is effective at reducing dcrs of apds , the coarse method of oven - heating devices can be time and energy consuming .",
    "alternative , more directed approaches such as the use of strong lasers may be considerably faster and require less energy ( see ref .  ) , which could be beneficial under a limited power budget of a satellite platform .",
    "our measurements correspond to the case where an apd is embedded on an orbiting satellite for up to two years prior to thermal annealing being applied . in a real satellite mission",
    ", thermal annealing could be applied intermittently and at regular intervals through a mission s lifetime .",
    "we speculate that doing so could repair some of the radiation - induced damage soon after it is created , thereby keeping the dcr low , delaying the necessity of deeper cooling , and extending detector lifetimes .",
    "experimental tests of the effect of multiple irradiation and annealing cycles are yet to be performed .",
    "this work was supported by the canadian space agency , nserc , innovation , science and economic development canada , cfi , and ontario mri .",
    "we thank the staff of the proton irradiation facility at triumf for their professional assistance .",
    "we also thank ryan cooney for helpful discussions , and jin gyu lim for assistance with data processing .",
