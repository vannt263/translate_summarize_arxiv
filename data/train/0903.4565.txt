    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the most plausible sources of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the recent detection of multi - tev gamma radiation from several snrs makes the case stronger , especially when coupled with multifrequency observations of the same remnants .",
    "however , despite all this progress , the evidence that snrs are indeed the main contributors to galactic cosmic rays remains circumstantial .",
    "a smoking gun evidence of efficient acceleration of cosmic rays in these sources can only come from the detection of high energy neutrinos , resulting from the decays of charged pions within the source .",
    "the acceleration of cosmic rays at supernova blast waves is well described by the non linear theory of diffusive shock acceleration ( nldsa ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this theory allows us to calculate the spectrum and spatial distribution of cosmic rays accelerated at a supernova shock taking into account the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock and , in its most recent version @xcite , also the generation of magnetic field through streaming instability induced by the accelerated particles @xcite and the dynamical reaction of the amplified magnetic field on the plasma .",
    "such a dramatic improvement in the quality of our theoretical approach allows us to finally compare theory with observations and make testable predictions for future observations .",
    "one of the most important recent breakthroughs in establishing the snr paradigm for the origin of cosmic rays has been the detection of narrow filaments of non - thermal x - ray emission in the direction of supernova remnant rims @xcite .",
    "the filaments are most commonly interpreted as the result of severe synchrotron energy losses of ultra relativistic electrons which are forced to radiate a large fraction of their energy ( in the form of x - rays ) in a narrow region downstream of the shock .",
    "the required strengths of the magnetic field are of order @xmath2 downstream of the shock .",
    "such large levels of magnetization might be the manifestation of magnetic field amplification in the upstream region , as due to the streaming of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "not only the detection of large magnetic fields signals for efficient cosmic ray acceleration , but in turn large magnetic fields are needed for increasing the maximum energy of accelerated particles to the knee region @xcite , namely for efficient acceleration .",
    "efficient cosmic ray acceleration and magnetic field amplification are two sides of the same coin .",
    "on the other hand , it has been proposed that the interpretation of the narrow x - ray rims may be flawed @xcite : they could in fact result from damping of magnetic field in the downstream region .",
    "the emission region would be narrow because the field disappears , not because particles lose energy effectively .",
    "the situation is currently subject of active debate : the damping would naively result in the appearance of filaments not only in x - rays , but also in the radio emission , and at present there is no evidence for such a phenomenon .",
    "in addition , the absence of magnetic field amplification ( or a mitigation of the effect ) would reduce the maximum energy achieved by the accelerated particles , unless the shock configuration is quasi - perpendicular @xcite .",
    "an additional possibility has been proposed in @xcite : the magnetic field could be amplified downstream ( and not upstream ) because of the development of corrugations on the shock surface which result in eddies in which the magnetic field winds up and gets amplified . in order for this scenario to lead to large maximum momentum of the accelerated particles , the field direction must be very inclined with respect to the shock normal in the upstream region .    a powerful diagnostic tool for particle acceleration in snrs is represented by the gamma ray emission in the gev - tev energy region .",
    "the spectrum of the gamma ray emission , its extension to high energies and the shape of the cutoff all provide precious information on whether the radiation is of leptonic or hadronic origin . in @xcite",
    "we discussed in detail the application of nldsa to the case of the supernova remnant rx  j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "if the hess data on this remnant are taken at face value , then it is problematic to fit them in the context of a leptonic model for at least two reasons : 1 ) the spectral cutoff expected in leptonic scenarios leads to a gamma ray emission which falls short of the highest energy data points measured by the hess telescope ; 2 ) in any case , fitting both the tev and x - ray data requires the presence of a very large background of infrared photons in the remnant .",
    "the second point raised above should be considered as a circumstantial evidence against a leptonic model , but by itself it does not suffice to rule out this class of models . in principle the first point is rather solid , but experimental effects might weaken its significance : a statistical ( and systematic ) uncertainty in the energy determination affects the steep gamma ray spectrum by making it look smoother than it actually is so that convolving the theoretical prediction with an estimate of the uncertainty in the energy determination makes the leptonic spectrum look more similar to the hadronic case .",
    "we address this issue in a quantitative way here .",
    "the hadronic interpretation appears to be more sound , but there are shortcomings in this case as well : first , the thermal x - ray flux expected from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 is larger than the observed radiation of synchrotron origin .",
    "second , the number of electrons needed to explain the observations is about @xmath3 of the number density of accelerated protons , at odds with the e / p ratio observed at earth at energy @xmath4 gev .",
    "both these points are however rather weak at the present time .",
    "the first is based on the assumption that electrons and protons share the same temperature downstream .",
    "this condition is hardly achievable and in fact one can easily argue that the temperature of electrons should be much smaller than that of protons . on the other hand , coulomb scattering might be sufficient to raise the electron temperature to a level large enough to excite emission lines of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "the second point is equally weak in that electrons might be accelerated at different stages of the snr .",
    "moreover , recent data from pamela @xcite and atic @xcite suggest that a substantial contribution to the observed electron spectrum at earth might come from sources other than snrs @xcite .    the safest way of proving or rejecting acceleration of hadrons in rx  j1713.7 - 3946 , as well as in other remnants , is to search for neutrinos produced in the decays of charged pions . in this paper",
    "we apply the nldsa model developed by @xcite , and previously used to describe the multifrequency spectrum of rx  j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , in order to calculate the expected neutrino flux from this remnant .",
    "previous attempts at estimating the neutrino flux from snrs have been typically based on phenomenological approaches , building on the assumption of a power law approximation for the gamma ray spectrum and simple scaling relations between the gamma ray and neutrino spectra .",
    "in @xcite the authors estimated a flux of 40 neutrino induced muons ( and antimuons ) per @xmath5 per year from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 , using a power law for the @xmath6-ray spectrum @xmath7 , based on cangaroo observations ; the maximum neutrino energy was assumed to be @xmath8 tev .",
    "neutrino oscillations , absorption and location of the detector were not taken into account .",
    "such effects were included by @xcite , where @xmath9 was used , the power law index being inferred from hess data ( no cut - off energy was assumed in this approach ) . the authors obtain a flux of neutrino induced muons @xmath10 . again based on hess data , @xcite used two different parametrizations for the @xmath6-ray spectra , a power law plus an exponential cutoff at @xmath11 tev and a broken power law ( with a knee at 6.7 tev ) , leading to @xmath12 and 5.4 @xmath13 respectively . an attempt to extract the proton spectrum from the hess data on the gamma ray flux ( assumed to be of hadronic origin ) , and compute the neutrino flux based on that , was done in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we carry out the calculations by using our model of nldsa which provides a self - consistent description of the acceleration of cosmic rays in the remnant .",
    "this leads to a shape of the gamma ray spectrum which is not a simple power law , due to the non linear effects induced by the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles and the amplified magnetic field . at the same time",
    "we also obtain self - consistently the neutrino spectrum , and we use it to derive the expected number of events in a @xmath0 neutrino telescope .    the paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : theory ] we summarize the technical aspects of nldsa and its application to particle acceleration in supernova remnants .",
    "we also describe the calculations of the non thermal radiation from rx  j1713.7 - 3946 , with special attention for the gamma ray emission in both the hadronic and leptonic scenario .",
    "we discuss in detail the possibility to use present and future observations to discriminate between the two , once a statistical uncertainty in the energy determination of the photon events is taken into account .",
    "we show that a leptonic scenario convolved with a gaussian distribution of the photon energies with @xmath14 or larger leads to the impossibility to distinguish the leptonic prediction from the hadronic one , at least using the hess data on rx  j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the implications for future gamma ray telescopes are also briefly discussed . on these premises",
    "it is very important to aim at the detection of the associated neutrino signal , whose intensity is calculated in   [ sec : signal ] , where we also estimate the neutrino induced muon signal in a @xmath0 neutrino detector .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in nldsa theory , the overall shock structure and the outcome of the particle acceleration process are inextricably linked .",
    "when acceleration is efficient , the pressure of accelerated particles affects the shock dynamics , leading to the formation of a precursor , namely a region where the fluid velocity progressively decreases while approaching the shock from far upstream . at the same time",
    "the streaming of accelerated particles is responsible for the instabilities that lead to magnetic field amplification . in turn , the fluid profile in the precursor and the amplified , turbulent magnetic field , with the scattering it provides ( and possibly the induced energy losses ) , determine the efficiency of particle acceleration and the resulting spectrum , including its high energy cutoff .    the shock structure and the accelerated particle spectrum are computed as in @xcite : the basic structure of the calculation is the same proposed in @xcite and @xcite , but with a crucial new aspect taken into account , namely the dynamical reaction of the self - generated magnetic field , which is included following the treatment of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this means that the conservation equations at the shock and in the precursor are modified so as to include the magnetic contribution .",
    "the compression factor at the subshock , @xmath15 , and the total compression factor , @xmath16 , are deeply affected by this change , resulting in a decrease of the compression ratio in the precursor , @xmath17 , as soon as the amplified magnetic field contributes a pressure comparable to that of the thermal gas upstream .",
    "this smoothening of the precursor reflects in spectra of accelerated particles which are closer to power laws , though the concavity typical of nldsa remains visible @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the proton spectrum is an output of our non linear calculation , once a recipe for injection has been established .",
    "following @xcite , particles are injected immediately downstream of the subshock .",
    "the fraction of particles crossing the shock surface which are injected in the acceleration process , @xmath18 , can be written as @xmath19 here @xmath20 is defined by the relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the momentum of thermal particles downstream .",
    "@xmath23 parametrizes the poorly known microphysics of the injection process , but @xmath22 is an output of the problem : as a result , the injection efficiency is affected by the dynamical reaction exerted by the accelerated particles and by the amplified magnetic field .",
    "finally , the maximum momentum of the accelerated particles is determined following @xcite for the computation of the acceleration time in the presence of a precursor .    for protons we use as a prescription the equality between the acceleration time and the age of the snr : @xmath24    for electrons ,",
    "energy losses can be important .",
    "their maximum momentum @xmath25 is determined by equating the acceleration time with the minimum between the time for energy losses and the age of the remnant .",
    "the loss time of electrons over a cycle of shock crossing needs to be weighed by the residence times , @xmath26 , upstream and downstream , so that the condition for the maximum momentum , in the loss dominated case , can be written as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the loss time , and the indexes `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' refer to quantities measured upstream and downstream respectively .",
    "the residence times in the context of the non linear theory of particle acceleration can be written explicitely ( from eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "( [ eq : pemax ] ) must be solved numerically for @xmath25 , contrary to the case of acceleration in the test particle regime .",
    "however an approximate analytical solution , valid when only synchrotron losses are important , was also proposed in @xcite .    as to the electron spectrum at the shock , @xmath29 , this is easy to calculate for @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , at a given momentum @xmath31 , the slope of the electron and proton spectrum is the same , if one assumes that both species experience the same diffusion coefficient .",
    "what is unconstrained _ a priori _ is the relative normalization of the two spectra , @xmath32 , which can only be obtained by fitting the observations .",
    "this is reasonable since electrons do not exert any appreciable dynamical reaction on the shock .",
    "the spectrum of electrons at energies around and above @xmath25 , namely the shape of the cutoff is harder to calculate in the context of non - linear theory .",
    "since the spectra we find for electrons at @xmath33 are not far from being power laws with slope @xmath34 , we adopt the modification factor calculated by @xcite for strong shocks in test particle regime .",
    "the resulting electron spectrum at the shock , in the loss dominated case , is : @xmath35}^2   e^{-p^2/p_{e,\\rm max}^2 } \\,.\\ ] ] what is important to notice in this expression is that the cutoff is not a simple exponential , a fact which reflects in the shape of the synchrotron spectrum radiated by the electrons , making it different from what assumed by most of the previous work on the subject . on the other hand ,",
    "if the maximum momentum is indeed determined by the age of the remnant , then the cutoff shape is expected to be exponential .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field close to the shock can be enhanced by several physical processes .",
    "however , here , as in @xcite , we focus on the amplification due to resonantly excited streaming instability induced by cosmic rays accelerated at the shock .",
    "resonant streaming instability @xcite is likely responsible for most of the magnetic field amplification in snrs after the beginning of the sedov phase @xcite , while the non - resonant mode of the same instability @xcite is more effective at earlier times .",
    "when the predictions of linear theory are extrapolated to the non - linear regime of field amplification ( which one is forced to do for lack of a better treatment ) , the resulting field strengths are in agreement with the values inferred by identifying the thickness of the x - ray filaments with the synchrotron loss length of the highest energy electrons .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field at the position @xmath36 upstream , @xmath37 , in the absence of damping , can be estimated from the saturation condition , that , for modified shocks , reads @xcite : @xmath38 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the magnetic pressure normalized to the incoming momentum flux at upstream infinity , @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 the alfvn velocity at upstream infinity , where only the background magnetic field , @xmath43 , assumed parallel to the shock normal , is present .",

    "the magnetic field downstream of the subshock is further enhanced by compression , according to : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnetic field immediately upstream of the subshock and we have used the fact that we are dealing with alfvn waves , and hence turbulence perpendicular to the shock normal .      the flux of non - thermal radiation at @xmath6-ray photon energies is computed as in @xcite . in that work we considered both possible scenarios for the origin of high energy photons in rx",

    "this quantity is usually expressed through the total inelastic @xmath31-@xmath31 cross section , @xmath59 , and the dimensionless distribution function @xmath60 for secondaries , as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fraction of proton energy transferred to the secondary particle .",
    "for the functions @xmath63 , which effectively enclose all the details of the hadronic processes involved , we use the analytical approximation derived in @xcite on the basis of numerical simulations of @xmath31-@xmath31 collisions with the publicly available code sibyll .",

    "as far as photons are concerned , @xmath64 also includes the contribution of @xmath65 meson decay , in addition to that of @xmath47 , with an overall accuracy of order a few  % .",
    "the estimate of neutrino fluxes is slightly less accurate , because @xmath66 only includes the decay of charged pions , while neglecting the contribution from @xmath67-mesons , and therefore leading to underestimate the neutrino flux by about 10  % . at energies lower than 100 gev , and down to the rest energy of the @xmath68-meson , we use the extrapolated formulae provided again by @xcite , that should be accurate within 10  % .",

    "the main target photon field contributing to emission in the high energy @xmath6-ray band is provided by dust - processed infrared photons , described by a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath69 k @xcite .",
    "following the instance of the ir+optical photon background in the interstellar medium ( ism ) we assume that the ratio of the optical to infrared energy densities remains @xmath69 , while the energy density of ir light , @xmath70 , is left as a free parameter ( in the ism , @xmath71 ) .    in order to compute the spectra of accelerated particles and the resulting emission , we need estimates for a number of environmental parameters relative to rx  j1713.7 - 3946 , namely its distance ( @xmath50 ) , age ( @xmath72 ) , expansion velocity ( @xmath73 ) , and the values of temperature ( @xmath74 ) , density ( @xmath75 ) , and magnetic field strength ( @xmath43 ) , in the surrounding medium .",

    "[ tab ] we report the time ( in years ) of observation needed to obtain a signal with significance level of 3@xmath119 , assuming a simple poisson distribution of events and a unit detection efficiency .",
    "one can see that if rx  j1713.7 - 3946 is indeed a hadronic accelerator a signal at the 3@xmath119 level could be seen in about 2 years of observation at energies above @xmath146 gev .",

    "in this paper we described the impact of non linear diffusive shock acceleration for the gamma ray and neutrino production in snrs .",
    "the intricate connection between particle acceleration , magnetic field amplification , dynamical reaction of the particles and magnetic field , and the radiation produced by the accelerated particles ( electrons and protons ) in principle allow , if taken at face value , to impose strong constraints on the ability of snrs to accelerate cosmic rays .",
    "an instance of how to use this powerful tool was provided in @xcite , where particle acceleration was described in terms of the non linear theory of refs .",
    "the magnetic field amplification was assumed to be due to resonant streaming instability and both the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles and of the amplified field were taken into account .",
    "the basic conclusion reached in @xcite is that the hadronic interpretation of the hess data automatically leads to a downstream magnetic field which is in agreement with that inferred from x - ray observations if the rims of non - thermal emission are interpreted as the result of synchrotron losses .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray spectrum , as measured by suzaku @xcite , was also reproduced with unprecedented accuracy . on the other hand , a satisfactory fit to the data within a leptonic scenario",
    "could only be achieved by considerably reducing the particle injection efficiency , through fine - tuning of the only free parameter of our calculations , @xmath23 , as defined in ",
    "[ sec : max_energy ] .",
    "moreover , in order for the leptonic model to fit hess data at all energies one is forced to require the presence of a diffuse background of infrared light exceeding that observed in the interstellar medium by more than a factor 20 .",
    "these requirements become less stringent if one decides not to include in the fit the highest energy hess data points , which strongly constrain the maximum energy of the radiating electrons .",
    "since the discrimination between the two models , hadronic and leptonic , is based on such a tricky region from the observational point of view , we decided to address here the issue of how well the photon energies need to be reconstructed at the telescope in order to tell the difference between the predictions of a leptonic and a hadronic model .",
    "the issue is of particular importance since the different predictions are of relevance in the energy region where the particle spectra ( and the gamma ray spectrum ) are already sharply falling and a small statistical uncertainty in the energy determination may have sizable implications on the shape of the observed spectrum .",
    "our calculations show that a statistical uncertainty in the energy determination larger than about 30% would inhibit the possibility to discriminate between a hadronic and a leptonic interpretation of tev data .",
    "of course a systematic uncertainty would strengthen the problem .",
    "these points need to be taken into account for the design of future telescopes , such as cta .",
    "needless to say that the observation of tev emitting snrs with the fermi gamma ray telescope will definitely contribute to settle the debate",
    ". this should certainly be the case for rx  j1713.7 - 3946 ( see also @xcite ) .    in the absence of clear multifrequency evidence however ,",
    "the smoking gun that snrs are efficient cosmic ray accelerators can only be provided by the unambiguous detection of neutrinos .",
    "here we used the same non linear theory of particle acceleration to infer the number of neutrino induced muons in a @xmath147 neutrino telescope .",
    "the flux is compared with the appropriate background of atmospheric neutrinos . at the distance of rx",
    "j1713.7 - 3946 and assuming a hadronic interpretation of hess data , we predict that a @xmath1 detection should be achieved by @xmath147 neutrino telescope at the antares location ( which is in the right hemisphere to detect rx  j1713.7 - 3946 ) in about 2 years of observation .",
