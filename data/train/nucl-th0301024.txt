    "<S> ' '' ''    a continuum expression for the trace of the massive dressed - quark propagator is used to explicate a connection between the infrared limit of the qcd dirac operator s spectrum and the quark condensate appearing in the operator product expansion , and the connection is verified via comparison with a lattice - qcd simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudoscalar vacuum polarisation provides a good approximation to the condensate over a larger range of current - quark masses . </S>"
