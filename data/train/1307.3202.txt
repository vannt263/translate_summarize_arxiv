    "to date , the theory of anderson localization in one - dimensional disordered systems is developed in great detail . in particular , various analytical approaches to the models with continuous potentials",
    "allow to derive all transport characteristics in dependence on the disorder strength and size of the samples ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , for the tight - binding and kronig - penney models",
    "the rigorous analysis is a difficult task due to the presence of resonances of the fabry - perot type .",
    "the famous example is the standard tight - binding anderson model for which at the band center the correct expressions for the localization length @xmath0 and transmission coefficient @xmath1 can be obtained with specific methods only @xcite .",
    "as was found , the band center corresponds to the lowest ( most important ) resonance resulting in a non - flat distribution @xmath2 of the phase @xmath3 of wave function , emerging when the wave propagates along a disordered sample .",
    "the same situation occurs for kronig - penney models with weak disorder for which the fabry - perot resonances have to be taken into account , if the aim is to develop general expressions valid for any value of energy inside allowed energy bands .",
    "although away from these resonances the analytical results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be obtained relatively easy , in the vicinity of the resonances the transport properties are mainly understood with the use of numerical simulations .",
    "one of the open problems , in connection with the presence of these resonances , is how to relate global transmission characteristics to the localization length @xmath0 which near the resonances can be obtained with one of specific methods .",
    "in contrast with continuous scattering potentials for which the so - called single parameter scaling ( sps ) holds , the question about the validity of the sps for tight - binding and kronig - penney models remains open .",
    "in the theory of scattering for continuous one - dimensional models the sps is trivially valid since the distribution of @xmath1 depends on one single parameter only , which is the ratio between the localization length @xmath0 and size of the sample @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the knowledge of the localization length ( defined in the limit @xmath5 ) gives a complete solution of the scattering problem .",
    "as for the tight - binding and kronig - penney models , the relation between the localization length and transport properties in the regions close to resonances is typically unknown , the fact that makes the sps hypothesis questionable . therefore , for such systems the problem of the relevance of @xmath0 to transport properties is of great importance .",
    "recently , the detailed study of the transmittance and reflectance in the vicinity of the lowest resonance has been performed in ref .",
    "the authors where able to develop the theory and obtain the analytical results for a quite simple model for which the potential consists of barriers and wells of a fixed thickness @xmath6 , however , with a weak variation of their heights and depths .",
    "the lowest resonance emerges when the phase shift @xmath7 of the wave equals @xmath8 after passing freely a barrier or well .",
    "numerical simulation shows that for such a value of @xmath7 a clear dip occurs for the transmission coefficient .",
    "it was shown how to describe the landauer resistance and transmittance in the ballistic regime , with the use of special technics based on the so - called  building block \" method .    in our paper",
    "we analyze the same model , however , paying main attention to the relevance of the localization length to transport characteristics , namely , to the transmission coefficient @xmath1 , its logarithm @xmath9 , and their variances . to do this",
    ", we develop a new method consisting of few steps .",
    "first , we show how to find an analytical expression for the phase distribution @xmath2 which is highly non - uniform near the resonances .",
    "then , with this distribution we demonstrate how the localization length can be analytically obtained in the vicinity of any resonance @xmath10 with @xmath11 integer .",
    "finally , we show that if to insert this localization length into the expression for the moments of @xmath1 obtained for the models with random continuous potentials , one gets a nice correspondence with numerical data in a whole energy region including the resonances .",
    "the comparison with numerical data is excellent outside the ballistic regime , i.e. in the region of a strong and intermediate localization , when the obtained localization length @xmath0 is smaller than or of the order of the system size @xmath4 .",
    "we also suggest how to improve the correspondence for the ballistic regime , indicating that the localization length found in a strong limit @xmath5 may have no physical sense since for a not large enough value of @xmath4 the phase distribution @xmath2 is still non - stationary . to overcame this problem we suggested to use the finite - length lyapunov exponent which can be computed numerically .",
    "then , the data show much better agreement with this semi - analytical approach .",
    "we study the localization and transport properties of a quantum particle with the mass @xmath12 propagating through an array of rectangular potential barriers and/or wells .",
    "the height @xmath13 of the @xmath14-th scatterer randomly depends on index @xmath14 , however , all the barriers / wells are of the same thickness @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ pre - fig01 ] ) .",
    "our study is restricted to the case of the over - barrier scattering when the particle energy @xmath15 is much larger than the strength of the random potential , @xmath16 .",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath17 of the particle traveling over the @xmath14-th barrier / well , reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wave number of the particle .",
    "its general solution can be presented as a superposition of two standing waves , @xmath20\\\\ + k_{n}^{-1}\\psi'_{n}(x_{n})\\sin\\left[k_{n}(x - x_{n})\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22-axis is directed along the array with @xmath23 standing for the coordinate of the left - hand edge of the @xmath14-th barrier , see fig .  [ pre - fig01 ] .",
    "the prime implies the derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "note that the constant thickness of the unit @xmath14-th barrier is defined as @xmath24     ( color online ) set of random barriers and wells.,width=302,height=188 ]    the general solution has to be complemented by two continuity conditions at the interfaces between neighboring barriers / wells , @xmath25 the combination of eqs .   and",

    "thus , the problem of quantum localization can be formally reduced to the analysis of the energetic instability of a stochastic oscillator @xcite .",
    "note that the hamiltonian map belongs to the class of area - preserving maps whose determinant equals unity .    for the analytical study it is convenient to pass to polar coordinates , namely , to the radius @xmath36 and angle @xmath37 , @xmath38 according to eq .",

    "note also that both maps are the time dependent ones , this fact makes the rigorous analysis problematic .    in line with the concept of the hamiltonian map ,",
    "the localization length @xmath0 is determined by the rate of exponential growth of the coordinate @xmath27 or momentum @xmath28 , once the initial conditions ( @xmath41 ) are specified . the conventional definition of the localization length @xmath0 is due to the inverse of the lyapunov exponent @xmath42 , and the latter can be defined as @xmath43 another definition which gives the same result , takes the form  @xcite , @xmath44 here the averaging @xmath45 is performed along the discrete  time \" @xmath14 . the second relation in",

    ", the dimensionless variable @xmath32 imposing the disorder , is specified by a random sequence of white - noise type with the zero average and variance @xmath46 , @xmath47 in numerical analysis , when generating random sequence @xmath32 we use the entries of the uniform box probability distribution inside a finite interval @xmath48 $ ] with the variance @xmath49",
    ". however , our analytical results are valid for any distribution of @xmath32 with correlation properties and finite small variance .    in terms of the statistical characteristics for the random quantity @xmath32 the conditions of weak disorder ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) and the over - barrier scattering ( @xmath52 ) can be rewritten in the explicit form , @xmath53 these conditions allow us to develop a proper perturbation theory .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the system under consideration is similar to an array of optic slabs with random and frequency dispersive refractive indices .",
    "the features of optic wave localization in the non - dispersive array , where the refractive index is independent of the wave frequency , were analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "as one can recognize below , the effect of energy / frequency dispersion drastically changes the localization properties of both quantum and optic disordered systems .",
    "for a weak disorder , see , we expand the @xmath54-map up to the second order in perturbation @xmath32 . then , we substitute the result into eq .   with the subsequent expansion of the logarithm , keeping the terms quadratic in disorder .",
    "taking into account that we consider the case of a white - noise disorder , one can neglect high - order correlations between the disorder @xmath32 and phase @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to perform the statistical averaging over @xmath32 in accordance with the correlation properties . as a result",

    "one can suggest that for non - zero values of @xmath7 only a small number of iterations are needed for @xmath37 to fill the whole interval [ @xmath57 .",

    "with the probability density is trivial and gives rise to the expression @xmath59 this result is in a complete correspondence with those previously obtained for discrete optic systems with randomized refractive index ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    ".    however , the flat distribution may not be valid for the resonant values of @xmath7 , namely , for @xmath60 with @xmath61 integers .",
    "for such rational values ( with respect to @xmath62 ) the unperturbed trajectory @xmath37 is the periodic orbit with the period @xmath63 , therefore , @xmath64 is the periodic delta - function of the same period . by adding a weak disorder the phases @xmath37 begin to diffuse around each of the delta - peaks , and it is not clear whether the fingerprint of these periodic orbits disappears in the form of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "one can expect that the strongest resonances correspond to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "below we restrict our study by these resonances only . as for high - order resonances with @xmath68 , it is quite naturally to expect that they give much less influence to the localization length , if any .    indeed , as is displayed in fig .",

    "this effect may be compared with the well known fabry - perot resonances emerging due to multiple reflections of the wave from the interfaces in multi - layered photonic structures .",
    "as was shown both theoretically and in experiments  @xcite , in the non - dispersive systems these resonances strongly suppress the localization .",

    "thus , our idea here is to explore the validity of the above expression for _ both _ non - resonant and resonant values of @xmath7 . in view of the results obtained in ref .",

    "on the other hand , our data have shown that in narrow regions of energy close to the resonances @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the expression completely ignores the presence of the resonances and gives incorrect results , provided the localization length is obtained by assuming the phase distribution is flat .",
    "thus , our key point is to explore whether the same expression , however , with the correct lyapunov exponent can serve both for non - resonant and resonant values of @xmath7 .",
    "the idea to combine the standard expression with the lyapunov exponent valid both in the non - resonant and resonant regions turns out to be very fruitful .",
    "indeed , the data in figs .",
    "[ pre - fig07](b , c ) and [ pre - fig08](b , c ) demonstrate an excellent agreement with our analytical predictions not only for the mean value of @xmath137 but also for the variance @xmath157 .    note , however , that our approach does not work if the value of @xmath136 is not large enough .",
    "this fact is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ pre - fig07](a ) and [ pre - fig08](a ) where @xmath158 .",
    "the estimate of the lyapunov exponent @xmath42 for the chosen strength of disorder @xmath71 shows that for both resonances the localization length @xmath0 is much larger than the system size @xmath159 , this corresponds to the ballistic regime .",
    "as one can see , a good correspondence between the data and our analytical approach occurs in a strongly localized regime , figs .",
    "[ pre - fig07](c ) and [ pre - fig08](c ) , and in the intermediate regime where the localization length @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath159 .",
    "again , we have to recall that the analytical expression works well for any ratio between the localization length and system size , provided the disorder is described by continuous potentials for which there are no resonance effects .",
    "the failure of our approach in the ballistic regime is due to the non - stationarity of the phase distribution as we explain below .    a closer inspection of the equation describing the evolution of phase @xmath3 shows that at the resonances the filling of the whole range @xmath40 $ ] by the phase is due to the terms containing the disorder , and not due to the constant drift due to non - resonant values of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the length @xmath160 for the emergence of a stationary distribution for @xmath3 can be very large , in contrast with what happens out of resonances .",

    "[ pre - fig07](a ) and [ pre - fig08](a ) show .    as one can see , the analysis of the ballistic regime ( @xmath171 ) in the vicinity of the resonances where @xmath172 requires two definitions , eqs .   and , for the lyapunov exponent",
    "the first ( standard ) definition is given for an infinite system , therefore , the stationary @xmath3-distribution is always achieved . on the other hand , eq .",
    "is the prelimit counterpart of the first one , and , therefore , depends on the system size @xmath136 .",
    "thus , eq .   automatically takes into account an actual phase distribution and provides quite good results even in the resonant ballistic regime , where the phase distribution is non - stationary . fig .",
    "[ pre - fig09 ] demonstrates that the size - dependent lyapunov exponent is saturated and becomes equivalent to the size - independent one at @xmath173 .",
    "consequently , at this system length the stationarity of @xmath3-distribution is successfully reached , and the analytical expression is valid . indeed , the numerical simulations originated from eqs .  , are in excellent agreement with analytical equations and .",
    "this fact is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ pre - fig07](b , c ) and [ pre - fig08](b , c ) .",
    "our results demonstrate that the formulas , provide quite good analytical description of the transport properties in comparison with numerical simulation even at the resonant energies .",
    "this may suggest that the hypothesis of single parameter scaling ( sps ) is correct provided the value of the localization length takes into account the non - flat distribution of phases @xmath3 in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "it should be however stressed that there are , at least , two different definitions of the sps .",
    "the first one , which is a trivial consequence of the expression , is that all transport properties depend on the ratio between the localization length and the sample size .",
    "another definition is originated from the analysis of tight - binding models of the anderson type and various kronig - penney models ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since for such models the resonances are unavoidable ,",
    "the rigorous analysis in the general form is absent .",
    "for this reason one uses another definition of the sps according to which all properties of the transport depend on the mean logarithm of transmittance , @xmath174 .",
    "this is correct , e.g. , for the gaussian distribution of @xmath149 ( log - normal distribution ) if the ratio @xmath175 is assumed to be constant .",
    "the latter occurs in strong localization regime and when random phase hypothesis holds true . under such circumstances @xmath176 equals @xmath177 , and",
    "this result is often used as a proof or disproof of the sps ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that random phase hypothesis is not a necessary condition for the validity of the sps @xcite .    in view of this common approach ,",
    "we have performed a careful numerical calculations of the parameter @xmath176 in a wide range of the sample size @xmath136 .",
    "the results shown in fig",
    ".  [ pre - fig10 ] turn out to be quite unexpected .",
    "namely , in spite of a good description of the first and second moments of @xmath137 by the expression with the correct lyapunov exponent , we have found the failure of the sps when exploring the variance of @xmath149 .",
