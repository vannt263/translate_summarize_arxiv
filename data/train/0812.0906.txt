    "let @xmath2 be a density matrix of a qubit with eigenvalues @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "its von neumann entropy is given by @xmath10 where the abbreviation @xmath11 with @xmath12 is used .",
    "in @xcite fuchs and graaf stated the inequality @xmath13 which can be read off from figure [ fig:1 ] .    to gain the desired extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) to @xmath1-dimensional quantum systems , we at first observe that its right hand side is 1-homogeneous in @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore after replacing @xmath16 by @xmath17^{-1 } ) $ ] , the inequality becomes valid for all positive matrices , not only for density matrices satisfying @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , we define for any positive hermitian @xmath19-matrix @xmath2 with eigenvalues @xmath20 @xmath21 the homogenized entropy @xmath22 is of degree one , @xmath23 , and it clearly coincides with @xmath16 at density matrices .",
    "@xmath22 is non - negative , concave , and super - additive on the cone of positive matrices , see for instance @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath24 is of degree one .",
    "it is concave and super - additive for positive matrices .",
    "the two functions eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] ) are bounded from above according to @xmath25 the central result of our paper is as following    for all positive semi - definite @xmath19 matrices @xmath2 we have @xmath26 equality is achieved if and only if either @xmath2 is of rank one ( and both sides of the inequality vanish ) or if @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath27 .    as an illustration of the theorem",
    "we show the difference between the right and the left hand side of this inequality for the case @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the difference vanishes at the corners ( pure states ) and at the center ( maximally mixed state ) .",
    "it takes its maximum along the edges , i.e. , for rank 2 states .     in the case",
    "the eigenvalues are parameterized by @xmath30 .",
    "so , @xmath31 corresponds to the triangle @xmath32 . ]    before giving the proof of this theorem we add some observations .",
    "_ remark 1 : _",
    "@xmath33 is strictly increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "+ _ remark 2 : _",
    "if @xmath2 is of rank @xmath34 then the operator is supported by a @xmath34-dimensional subspace . using this sub - space",
    ", we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) remains valid after replacing @xmath1 by the rank of @xmath2 . by this argument",
    "we see that it suffices to prove eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) for matrices with maximal rank .",
    "+ _ remark 3 : _ below we shall use the notation @xmath35 where @xmath36 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "we will prove that this function takes its global maximum at @xmath37 .",
    "numerical checks ( up to @xmath38 ) support the more general + * conjecture : * _ this function @xmath39 is concave on the set of density operators . _ + _ remark 4 : _ in @xcite , mitchison and jozsa considered the entropy as function of the elementary symmetric polynomials @xmath40 defined by , e.g. , @xmath41 they showed that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 ( and therefore @xmath44 for all @xmath45 . ) in the light of this it seems natural to ask for the possibility of other estimates of the entropy , for instance by using higher symmetric polynomials .",
    "abbreviating @xmath46 , @xmath47 , we consider the function eq .",
    "( [ eq:6a ] ) , @xmath48 according to remark 2 we have to ask for extrema on @xmath49 .",
    "this implies @xmath50 for all @xmath51 .",
    "we use @xmath52  @xmath53  @xmath54 to get @xmath55 we look for extrema of @xmath56 under the condition @xmath57 they must obey @xmath58 now @xmath56 is homogeneous of degree zero and @xmath7 of degree one .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 hence , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) can have solutions only for @xmath60 . now",

    "one knows that @xmath64 is strictly decreasing for @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , all @xmath66 must be equal and @xmath67 it is easy to check that this extremum is a maximum and therefore @xmath68 as this maximum is increasing with @xmath1 , we are done .",
    "let @xmath69 be a channel or , more general , a trace preserving positive map between two finite - dimensional quantum state spaces .",
    "the minimum output entropy , @xmath70 , is the minimum of @xmath71 where @xmath2 is running through all density operators .",
    "obviously , @xmath70 is smaller than the minimal value of @xmath72 , where @xmath2 is any density operator . because @xmath24 is concave , its minimum is attained on rank one projection operators , i.e. , pure states . by our theorem we get the estimate @xmath73 where the minimum runs through all unit vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the maximal rank attained by density operators of the form @xmath76 .",
    "the entanglement of formation of a bipartite pure state is defined as the von neumann entropy of one of the subsystems @xmath77 where the minimum is taken over all convex decompositions of @xmath2 into a mixture of pure states @xmath78 , see bennett et al @xcite .",
    "another important entanglement measure is the concurrence , originally introduced for 2-qubit systems , see @xcite for a review .",
    "a possible generalization to larger systems proposed by rungta et al @xcite makes again use of the second symmetric polynomial : @xmath79 by theorem 1 every right hand side sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) can be bounded by a multiple of that of eq .",

    "one considers the holevo quantity @xmath84 and the @xmath83-concurrence @xmath85 completely similar to the reasoning above we get the inequality @xmath86 here @xmath75 is again the maximal rank of the matrices @xmath87 with pure @xmath88 ."
