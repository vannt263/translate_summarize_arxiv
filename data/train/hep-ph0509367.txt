    "the proposed @xmath0 international linear collider ( ilc ) , is expected to open a new era of precision physics and help understanding many of the fundamental questions that the discoveries of the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) will arise . with energies up to at least 500 gev in its first phase @xcite , the ilc will uniquely provide a level of experimental precision not reached so far yet in particle physics , demanding an equivalent understanding of the theoretical predictions and uncertainties which , for the two fermion production , should not be larger than a few permill .    in order to fulfill such theoretical duty , the calculations within the present standard model must include typically the next or next - to - next to leading order perturbative corrections , depending on the process .",
    "the case of two fermion production is specially interesting since it plays a key role for    1 .",
    "luminosity monitoring ( bhabha scattering ) , 2 .",
    "directly measuring precise distributions and asymmetries , 3 .   establishing limits on _",
    "new physics _ as contact interaction , @xmath2 , leptoquarks , or gravitons in extra dimensions , 4 .   quantifying backgrounds for other processes .",
    "thanks to the recent progress in computer technologies and software applications , particle physics has greatly profited from an indeterminate number of tools and packages developed for the specific task of automating perturbative calculations . globally speaking , today s available calculational tools do not individually meet the next properties :    * performing higher order corrections beyond leading order .",
    "* free - availability and free - based code ( i.e.  neither the package nor its software requirements have to be purchased ) . * comprehensibility , both in documentation and installation . * flexibility , being able to deal with different processes , theoretical models and to allow some modifications .    next , it will be shortly described some features of the package showing some interesting immediate applications in two fermion production .",
    "the tool  @xcite is designed with the intention of matching the desired requirements pointed out above .",
    "its goal is to perform automated perturbative calculations of cross sections in high energy physics , restricted to @xmath3 fermion processes within the electroweak standard model ( ewsm ) and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the tool integrates only free - of - charge packages existing on the market .",
    "as the calculation proceeds , in a modular fashion , it profits from an adaptation @xcite of the  package @xcite ( based itself on the  @xcite code ) for the generation and analysis of feynman graphs , the  @xcite language when dealing analytically with the large expressions in the amplitudes and , finally , the  @xcite library ( also integrating the  package @xcite ) for the numerical calculation of the loop integrals .    in order to simplify and guarantee a wide portability during installation",
    ", it proceeds conforming to the standards of the packages .",
    "the operations include a customization of your system settings via configure and the later extraction of individual packages ( if needed ) and examples by a make instruction . at this point",
    "the installation is finished .    a detailed discussion of the algorithms used",
    ", the strategy of the calculation and internal work of each of the modules has been already presented elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "i will shortly discuss the working environment and the examples provided to the user .",
    "automation requires effective intercommunication and a smart way to organize the tasks .",
    "this second concept has been exploited through the makefile environment , providing a chain dependency between files and modules .",
    "the makefile environment accomplishes the running of the whole process , from letting the user only the responsability of modifying the driver file to building the tree , loop and fortran sections . at the end , the compilation of the program leading to the final results is achieved without further interaction .",
    "the main directory into a process contains a main makefile that organize the calculation in a generic footing . under a generic unique make command",
    ", it calls the submakefiles level.mk and fortran.mk , providing them the necessary variables to carry out the tree level , the loop level and the compilation of the generated code for numerical output .",
    "the makefile will consider the inclusion of extra files in the main process directory as new settings for the computation instead of the default ones appearing in the directories form / kitform3/ and diana / prg/.    as a result of the previous call the directories tree/ , loop and fortran are created and filled with the log files of the diagram generation , symbolic amplitudes , eps drawings of the diagrams ( for the two levels ) and the complete programs , subroutines with the form factors grouped by topologies and other kinematical functions .",
    "the elapsed time will always be printed in the file makefile.log .",
    "the numerical executable program main.out is located inside fortran and on its default running returns a sample of differential cross sections for five different angles at a given energy of 500 gev .",
    "there are 7 printout columns : first and second remind the energy and scattering angle . born cross section , virtual loop corrections and soft photon radiation appear in the columns 3 to 5 respectively , while the sum of all them corresponds to the column number 6 ( the expected result ) .",
    "the last column is reserved for the squared of the loop amplitude serving as a rough estimator of the order of the error at next perturbative order , or main result in cases where the tree level is not physically possible .",
    "alternative integrated cross sections and/or forward - backward asymmetries are available when the logical variables lprintics , lprintfba become ` true ' . for them a second group of columns show the estimated integration error following richardson extrapolation to romberg integration @xcite .",
    "the package contains three examples located in the examples/ directory which the user may run without further considerations for test and learning purposes .",
    "two of them contain radiative corrections :    * bhabha scattering in qed ( @xmath4 in bhabha_qed ) , * flavour changing through neutral current example ( @xmath5 in lele.bs ) .    with the purpose of giving a flavour of execution time ,",
    "the examples were run on two different machines , representing today s typically available computers .",
    "the results are shown in table timings and take from some seconds to minutes .",
    "only when the size of the produced  code begins to be large ( i.e.  more than @xmath6200 kb for a single subroutine to be compiled ) , then the gnu compiler gets extremely overloaded slowing down significantly the overall time .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two of the processes where it is expected to measure , with relatively high statistics , the indirect impact of the higgs sector due to the large couplings involved through the top quark mass .",
    "+     two plots are presented in fig .",
    "[ ics - bt ] , trying to emphasize the magnitude of the corrections with increasing energy for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 production .",
    "the figure on top shows the expected integrated cross section , for the whole phase space .",
    "continuous lines represent the calculation at born level while the others , dotted and dash - dotted lines , account for the corrections with two different cuts on the maximum energy available for the soft - photon , which is related with the acollinearity of the two - fermions in the final state . the lower graph , scans the expected forward - backward asymmetry , up to 1 tev .",
    "note the phenomenological implications of the @xmath11-boson threshold , inverting the asymmetry for the @xmath12 quarks and also leading to the well - known resonance on the integrated cross section .",
    "for the top , the threshold energy for production is above the @xmath11 mass leading to positive asymmetries .",
    "besides the phenomenological implications of bhabha scattering ( @xmath13 ) in accelerator physics , it has also been considered here for ` calibration ' in automated computations .",
    "the fact of comparing the massive case introduce most of the potential sources for discrepancies between two different implementations .",
