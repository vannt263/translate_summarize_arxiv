    "the idea that scale invariance is at the origin of critical phenomena associated with equilibrium second order phase transitions has proven to be very fruitful .",
    "the analysis of scale transformations in equilibrium statistical systems , now known as renormalization group ( rg ) , has indeed allowed for the explicit calculation of critical exponents and , moreover , has led to the introduction of new fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality .",
    "the extension of the rg approach to non - equilibrium phenomena , where scale invariance is widely observed , and the identification of new universality classes , is of great importance from both theoretical and practical points of view .",
    "technically , the rg ideas can be implemented in different ways .",
    "the most standard one for systems at equilibrium is to consider their stationary probability distribution written in terms of continuum coarse - grained fields , and study them perturbatively around their corresponding upper critical dimension .",
    "the most systematic way to extend the previous methods to non - equilibrium systems , where in general the stationary probability distribution is not known , is to cast them into a continuum dynamical equation @xcite , or equivalently into a generating functional or action @xcite .",
    "this last one can , in principle , be treated using the same perturbative techniques developed to deal with equilibrium systems . however , there are some cases where perturbative methods around a mean field solution are not suitable . in these cases",
    "the @xmath2-expansion fails to give information on the relevant physics .",
    "this turns out to be governed by a strong coupling , perturbatively inaccessible fixed point .",
    "the prototypical example of this class of systems is the well known kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation for surface growth @xcite , where the properties of rough surfaces have not been so far explained satisfactorily in generic spatial dimension .",
    "this is a problem of great theoretical importance since the kpz describes not only the properties of rough surfaces@xcite , but is also related to the burgers equation of turbulence @xcite , to directed polymers in random media @xcite , and to systems with multiplicative noise @xcite . in particular ,",
    "one of the most debated issues in this context is the existence of an upper critical dimension , above which the system is well described by the nontrivial infinite dimensional limit@xcite .",
    "although the usual approach fails for kpz , the presence of generic scale invariance suggests that also for this system the basic idea of the rg approach should be applicable in some form .",
    "real space approaches have proven useful wherever standard perturbative techniques fail @xcite .",
    "this , for example , is the case of fractal growth , and in particular for diffusion - limited - aggregation@xcite .",
    "however , the attempts to apply standard real space techniques to the kpz problem ( and to surface growth in general ) fail because of a fundamental technical difficulty : the anisotropy of the scaling properties of the system .",
    "that is , in order to cover with blocks ( in the kadanoff sense @xcite ) a surface , isotropic blocks can not be used : lengths in different directions must scale in different ways , and the relative shape of blocks has to depend upon the scale via an exponent that is unknown .",
    "this makes conceptually non - trivial the application of real space rg procedures to surface growth processes .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the scale invariant properties of generic interface growth processes through the introduction of a real - space method . to achieve this goal we introduce some new ingredients permitting us to overcome the aforementioned problem .",
    "in particular , we introduce the idea that the statistical properties of growing surfaces on large scales can be described in terms of an effective scale invariant dynamics for renormalized blocks .",
    "such dynamics is the fixed point of a rg transformation relating the parameters of the dynamics at different coarse - graining levels .",
    "the study of the rg flow , of the fixed points and of their stability gives the universality classes and their associated exponents .",
    "as a first application of the method , we study the kpz growth dynamics and obtain accurate estimates for the roughness exponent ( when compared with numerical results ) in spatial dimensions from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . furthermore , an analytical approximation allows us to exclude the existence of a finite upper critical dimension for kpz dynamics and suggests that the roughness exponent decays as @xmath5 for large dimensions , shedding light on a currently much debated issue .    in order to show the generality of the new real space scheme and test its accuracy , we also apply it to the well known linear theory , the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation .",
    "we reproduce the expected behavior in different dimensions , confirming the general applicability of the method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the general rg method , the main concepts , the basic equations , and discuss all the approximations involved . in section iii",
    "we review some results associated with kpz growth and apply the new rg method to such problem .",
    "we present some simple analytical approximations , explicit results for spatial dimensions up to @xmath4 , and discuss the large dimensional limit in detail . in section iv we report results on the analysis of the edwards - wilkinson equation . in section v a critical discussion of the method and of the results is reported .",
    "partial accounts of the work presented here have already been published recently , with a slightly different notation@xcite .",
    "in order to present the rg method let us consider a generic surface growth model where the height is a single - valued function @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the position in a @xmath8-dimensional substrate and @xmath9 denoting time .",
    "the possibility of having overhangs will not be considered here , as they are known to be irrelevant for the asymptotic behavior of kpz - like growth @xcite .",
    "the generic growth model under consideration can be either described at the microscopic level by a stochastic equation or by a discrete dynamical rule . in the first case",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath7 are continuous variables , while in the latter they are discrete .",
    "the roughness of a system , when considered on a substrate of linear size @xmath11 , is defined by w^2(l , t)= 1 l^d _ x ^2 , where ( t ) = 1 l^d _ x h(x , t ) .",
    "if we start the growth process from a flat configuration , for short times the roughness grows as w(l , t ) ~t^until it reaches a stationary state characterized by w(l ) ~l^. the crossover between the two behaviors occurs at a characteristic time @xmath12 , that scales with @xmath11 as @xmath13 .",
    "this is the time scale over which correlations decay in the stationary state .",
    "the exponents @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are to a large extent universal for many different growth processes , and are related by the trivial scaling relation @xmath17 .",
    "we now introduce the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) procedure aimed at the study the stationary state and in particular at the determination of the roughness exponent @xmath14 .",
    "the following subsections are structured as follows . in a )",
    "we introduce the geometric elements or blocks ( equivalent to the kadanoff blocks in standard rsrg methods ) suitable to deal with anisotropic situations . in b ) we discuss the effective dynamics of the previously defined blocks at a generic scale . in c )",
    "we introduce the rg equation and explain how the roughness exponent is determined . finally in d )",
    "we analyze critically the approximations involved in general in the method .",
    "the first nontrivial problem in the development of a rsrg approach is to find a sensible description of the geometry of the growing surface at a generic scale , i. e. how to build the analog of a block - spin transformation@xcite .",
    "given the anisotropy of the system , the shape of the blocks must depend on the scale .",
    "therefore , subdividing a cell in subcells is not a feasible task and the explicit construction of the block - spin transformation is not possible .",
    "hence we develop an alternative strategy . to obtain a description at a generic scale @xmath18 of the growing surface",
    ", we consider a partitioning of the @xmath19-dimensional space in cells of lateral size @xmath20 and vertical size @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is a constant and @xmath18 labels the scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "a cell is declared to be empty or filled according to a majority rule . in this way we pass from the microscopic description @xmath6 to a coarse - grained one at scale @xmath18 , fully defined by the number @xmath23 of filled blocks in the column @xmath24 .",
    "heights at scale @xmath18 are measured in units of @xmath21 .",
    "the only characteristic vertical length at scale @xmath18 is that fixed by typical intrinsic fluctuations of the surface of a lateral size @xmath25 .",
    "this suggests to take h_k = w(l_k ) ~l_k^ , [ h_k ] where @xmath26 is a proportionality constant that will be discussed later .",
    "this equation expresses the requirement of scale invariance in the geometric description .",
    "any other choice would result either in a redundant description ( if @xmath27 as @xmath28 ) where too many ( infinite ) blocks would be needed to describe fluctuations in the same column , or in a too coarse description ( if @xmath29 as @xmath28 ) . by imposing eq .",
    "( [ h_k ] ) , we always have a meaningful covering of the surface upon scale changes",
    ". observe that since in general @xmath30 , the shape ( i.e. the ratio of vertical to horizontal length ) of the blocks changes with the scale @xmath18 .",
    "contrarily to the usual rg approach , the definition of the block - spin transformation depends explicitly on the roughness exponent @xmath14 , the calculation of which is the final goal of the method .    the constant @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ h_k ] ) fixes the unit of measure of our blocks .",
    "its optimal value can be determined as follows .",
    "the distribution of microscopic height fluctuations within a block can be mapped into an _ effective _ distribution with the same average @xmath32 and standard deviation . for simplicity",
    "we take it to be bimodal @xmath33   =   p & \\delta & \\{h(x)-[{\\bar h}+(1-p ) h_k]\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   +   ( 1-p ) & \\delta & \\{h(x)-[{\\bar h}-p h_k]\\}. \\label{pofh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this distribution results from mapping all points with microscopic height larger than @xmath32 to @xmath34 and those smaller than @xmath32 to @xmath35 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 describes the degree of asymmetry of the distribution : the fluctuations inside a block can then be calculated , using eq .",
    "( [ pofh ] ) , as w^2(l_k)= p ( 1-p ) h^2_k , [ prop ] which implies that the constant @xmath31 is given by c = 1 p(1-p ) . for a symmetric distribution @xmath37 and therefore @xmath38 .",
    "in general the height distribution is not symmetric , i. e. there is some nonvanishing skewness and one must consider @xmath39 .",
    "the second step in the construction of the rg procedure is the definition of the effective dynamics at a generic scale @xmath18 , i.e. the determination of the growth rules for the blocks defined in the previous subsection .",
    "the effective dynamics will depend on a set of scale dependent parameters .",
    "the changing of scale induces a flow in the parameter space whose fixed points correspond to the scale invariant dynamics .",
    "analogously to what happens in the usual application of the rg approach to equilibrium systems , it may happen that mechanisms not appearing in the microscopic rule are generated upon coarse - graining . in the language of equilibrium systems this means that operators not included in the bare hamiltonian can be generated iteratively .",
    "conversely , microscopic ingredients can prove to be irrelevant and be progressively eliminated when going to coarser scales .",
    "therefore , exactly as in the equilibrium case the choice of the parametrization of the effective dynamics is not trivial : principles as the preservation of symmetries and conservation laws must be the guidelines . in general , the effective dynamics will be defined in terms of the transition rates for the addition of occupied blocks at a generic coarse - grained scale , that is , r[h(i , k ) h(i , k ) ] = r(x_k^1,x_k^2,  ,x_k^n ) .",
    "the number of parameters @xmath40 is in principle arbitrary , although in the applications presented below it will be limited to one @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the more complete the parametrization the better the final description of the statistical scale invariant state .",
    "we will discuss this problem in detail in subsection d.      so far we have defined the geometrical and dynamical aspects of the coarse - graining procedure .",
    "these give us the necessary ingredients to introduce the rg transformation .",
    "the explicit derivation of it is based on the following property of the roughness @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider a @xmath8-dimensional system of linear size @xmath11 and partition it in @xmath42 blocks of size @xmath43 ( labeled by the index @xmath44 ) .",

    "this property is read as follows : if one takes @xmath47 the first term on the right hand side is @xmath48 , the total roughness within a block of size @xmath25 ; the second is the roughness of the configuration in which blocks of size @xmath25 are considered as flat objects .",

    "this is done by means of a self - consistency requirement for the description of the same system at two different levels of detail , i.e. the total width of a system should be independent on the size of the blocks we use to describe it . to make this idea more precise ,",

    "hence if @xmath69 the scale invariant dynamics specified by @xmath65 is an attractive fixed point under changes of scale .",
    "extension of the previous formalism to the case of @xmath70 parameters of the dynamics is straightforward .",
    "the @xmath70 rg transformations are obtained by imposing the consistency of the description of the same system when divided in @xmath71 and @xmath72 blocks , in @xmath72 and @xmath73 blocks , and so on @xcite .",
    "let us discuss now the approximations involved in the method . there are two steps where approximations come into play : the first is the choice of the parametrization of the scale invariant dynamics .",
    "the second is the computation of @xmath51 .    with respect to the first problem",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that under coarse - graining the microscopic dynamics will flow towards a scale invariant dynamics depending in principle on an infinite number of parameters .",
    "this proliferation is analogous to what happens in rsrg approaches to equilibrium systems .",
    "the restriction to a finite ( and small ) number of parameters involves unavoidably an approximation , due to the projection of the rg flow onto the sub - space spanned by these parameters .",
    "however , a very important difference with respect to equilibrium critical phenomena is that here the scale invariant dynamics is `` self - organized critical '' , that is , there are no relevant operators",
    ". only irrelevant fields , with negative scaling dimensions , need to be parametrized .",
    "the system is by definition _ on the critical manifold _ and , by iteration of the rsrg transformation , it converges to the stable fixed point , without any fine tuning of parameters .",
    "the projection onto a low - dimensional parameter space yields a projected rg flow which will share these same properties . the fixed point in this sub - space , being the projection of the actual fixed point in the high - dimensional space , will have the same qualitative properties .",
    "even the simplest parametrization capturing the correct symmetries of the dynamics can provide a quite accurate determination of the properties of the system in this case . on the contrary ,",
    "when relevant fields are present , as in second order phase transitions , truncation effects are quite dramatic .",
    "the reason is that relevant fields have , in general , a non - vanishing component on any discrete ( lattice ) operator .",
    "any approximation due to truncation is amplified by the rg iteration thus driving the flow _ out of _ the critical manifold along the relevant directions .",
    "the determination of the fixed point becomes then very difficult@xcite .",
    "the second source of approximation is the computation of @xmath51 . as stated above this quantity",
    "is the stationary roughness of a system composed of @xmath43 substrate sites evolving according to the dynamical rules specified by the parameters @xmath74 .",
    "this is a perfectly well defined quantity that may in principle be computed to any degree of accuracy by solving the master equation .",
    "however very often the structure of the master equation is too complicated to allow for a full solution .",
    "one then has to devise suitable simplifications to make the analytical computation feasible .",
    "this involves approximations that affect the final result .",
    "we will see an example of this way of proceeding and discuss how the effect of the approximation can be controlled .",
    "alternatively , when @xmath22 and @xmath8 are not too large , one can resort to the numerical evaluation of @xmath51 . in practice",
    "this boils down to performing monte carlo simulations of small systems evolving with different values of the parameters @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to stress that the mc procedure involves no approximation , except for the fluctuations associated with statistical sampling .",
    "we will describe below an example of this alternative way of computing @xmath51 .",
    "a delicate issue is also the choice of the boundary conditions . in the conceptual framework described above",
    ", @xmath51 is the roughness of a section of size @xmath22 of an infinitely extended surface .",
    "this would suggest the use of open boundary conditions .",
    "on the other hand , when integrating out degrees of freedom relative to height fluctuations inside the cell , one should not consider the fluctuation of the average slope .",
    "this slope effect is eliminated if one uses closed ( i.e. periodic ) boundary conditions .",
    "even though the choice of the appropriate boundary conditions is not trivial , we will see , in the kpz case , that the use of periodic or open boundary conditions has little effect on the value of the exponent .",
    "furthermore , one expects that both truncation errors and those induced by neglecting fluctuations of boundary conditions vanish as the parameter @xmath22 grows .",
    "arguments in support of this conclusion are reported in the appendix i.",
    "the kardar - parisi - zhang equation is the minimal continuum equation capturing the physics of rough surfaces . after appearing in 1986 @xcite ,",

    "the difference between the kpz equation and the linear equation ( edwards - wilkinson ) , describing surfaces growing under the effect of random deposition and surface tension , is the presence of a nonlinear term proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "this nonlinear term is generated by microscopical processes giving rise to lateral growth , i.e. the fact that growth velocity is normal to the local surface orientation .",

    "on the other hand , numerical results seem to indicate that the exponent @xmath14 decays continuously with the system dimensionality up to @xmath92 , excluding therefore @xmath87 as upper critical dimension @xcite .",
    "finally , some doubts have been cast on the validity of the continuum approach to study rough surfaces @xcite .",
    "summing up , the issue of the behavior of the kpz dynamics for @xmath93 is a highly debated one , and it is extremely desirable to have alternative approaches shedding light into the problem . in what follows we present the application of our new rg scheme to kpz growth .",

    "in some sense the procedure can be seen as a kind of finite size scaling approach allowing for the evaluation of scaling exponents via the extrapolation of small size mc simulations .",

    "rsrg methods based on an explicit geometric mapping ( block - spin transformation ) are quite accurate ( and sometimes even exact ) close to the lower critical dimension . problems related with this geometric transformations become worse and worse as the dimension increases . in our perspective , the only limitation has to do with the quality of the parametrization of the rg transformation .",

    "however , if one uses the parametrization of the @xmath184 theory , one recovers @xmath88 within the rsrg migdal approach @xcite even for ferromagnetic systems .    in any case , notice that our rsrg method does not need an explicit geometrical definition of the rg transformation .",
    "therefore it bypasses the problems related to a ) . in some sense , this is similar to the phenomenological rg method @xcite where the rg transformation is defined implicitly through finite size scaling arguments .",
    "remarkably , phenomenological rg calculations are quite accurate .    with respect to point b ) , as discussed above the absence of relevant fields makes truncation errors much less important than in ordinary applications of the rg .",
    "furthermore we note that in the kpz problem one has to compute exponents depending only on the rg transformation at the fixed point , i. e. the critical parameter .",
    "this is profoundly different from what happens in ising - like problems , where some exponents ( as , for example , the correlation length exponent @xmath77 ) depend on the derivatives of the rg transformation around it : as a consequence @xmath77-type exponents are rather difficult to estimate since , even if the location of the fixed point is determined accurately , the computation of the derivatives is much less precise .",
    "no exponents of such type exist in the kpz case .",
    "this is , in our opinion , a further reason for the great accuracy of the new method with respect to the usual rsrg .    as a final point ,",
    "it is worth discussing the current limitations of the method .",
    "it is clear from the results presented , that a most important role in the method is played by the choice of the parametrization of the scale invariant dynamics .",
    "this is particularly true since one deals with a monoparametric description of the growth process : if one could easily introduce several parameters and study their flow under the rg , the stability of the results when details are changed would be greatly improved . within the present framework , the inclusion of additional parameters is however not straightforward .",
    "the problem is that additional rg equations are provided only by the use of equation  ( [ main ] ) with @xmath22 , @xmath120 , @xmath185 and so on .",
    "this requires the computation of @xmath51 on systems whose size becomes quickly prohibitively large .",
    "a remarkable improvement of the method would therefore be the identification of additional rg transformations independent from eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) . despite this difficulty , we believe that the theoretical framework presented here constitutes an important new element in the field of surface growth and deserves further investigation , in particular with respect to possible applications to other open problems , and generalization to deal with time - dependent properties .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have presented a real space renormalization group method developed to deal with surface growth processes .",
    "the new method overcomes the difficulties inherent to standard real space renormalization group analysis of anisotropic situations .",
    "it is based on the definition of anisotropic blocks of generic scale and of a parametrized effective dynamics for the evolution of such blocks . imposing the surface width to be the same",
    "when using different scales ( different block sizes ) we write a renormalization group equation .",
    "its associated fixed points define the scale invariant effective dynamics and permit to determine the roughness exponent @xmath14 .",
    "we have employed the new method to study the kardar - parisi - zhang and the edwards - wilkinson universality classes . in particular , for kpz we compute the @xmath14 exponent in dimensions from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the results are in very good agreement with the best numerical estimates in all dimensions .",
    "moreover , we present analytical calculation excluding the possibility of kpz having a finite upper critical dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "well known results for the ew universality class are obtained , confirming the generality of the method .",
    "we acknowledge interesting discussions with a. gabrielli , a. maritan , g. parisi , a. stella , c. tebaldi , g. bianconi , and a. vespignani . this work has been partially supported by the european network contract fmrxct980183 , and by a m. curie fellowship , erbfmbict960925 , to m. a. m.",
    "in this appendix we investigate the behavior of the method for large values of @xmath22 . at the fixed point @xmath65 , eq .",
    "( [ rgeq ] ) reads ^2(b^2,x^*)=c^4(b , x^*)+2 ^ 2(b , x^ * ) .",
    "[ o1 ] if we now assume that , for @xmath186 , ^2(b , x)b^2as it should , we find that eq .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) becomes @xmath187 - 2ca(x^*)b(x^*)b^{-\\omega } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -2a(x^*)b^{-2\\alpha}+ { \\rm subleading~terms}=0   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that for @xmath188 the fixed point tends to x^ * _ :  ca(x^*_)=1 [ xstar ] whereas for large but finite @xmath22 x^*_b = x^*_-b^- with @xmath189 the rg estimate @xmath190 of the exponent @xmath14 is given by @xmath191}{2\\ln b}= \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\alpha+\\frac{\\ln \\left[1+b^{-2\\alpha } -2cd(x^*_\\infty)b^{-\\delta}+ cb(x^*_\\infty ) b^{-\\omega}+ \\ldots\\right]}{2\\ln b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and converges to the exact value for @xmath192 .",
    "note that only the finite @xmath22 corrections depend on @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath193 = -c b(x^ * _ ) b^- 2 b [ 20 ] if @xmath194 = -b^-2 2 b with respect to the stability of the fixed point one finds r(x^*)=-b^-2-(+ ) b^-+  [22 ]",
    "this means that , as it should be expected , the fixed point becomes more and more stable as @xmath22 increases : for larger @xmath22 fewer rg iterations are necessary to reach the scale invariant regime .",
    "these results for large @xmath22 are not surprising .",
    "when the systems become large , the effect of the boundary conditions is clearly small and also the choice of the parametrization of the scale invariant dynamics tends to become irrelevant , since parameters that are not included in the explicit parametrization are generated by the rg procedure on large sytems .",
    "the formulae  ( [ 20]-[22 ] ) certify that the rg method is asymptotically correct .",
    "in this appendix we present the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq54 ] ) .",
    "let us consider @xmath22 and @xmath8 arbitrarily large but finite , so that @xmath196 .",
    "we have _ n=1^b^d-1 _",
    "n = _ 0 b^d _ n=1^b^d-1 1 _",
    "n/_k + b^d - n = _ 0 b^d _ k g + o(_k^2 ) , where g=_n=1^b^d-1 1 _ n. hence _ 0 = 1 1 + b^d _ k g + o(_k^2 ) and _ n = b^d _ k _ n + o(_k^2 ) .",
    "the roughness of a system of size @xmath22 is therefore @xmath197 fog large @xmath22 and @xmath8 and infinitely strong lateral growth parameter @xmath198 , the set of high sites will form , when @xmath199 a @xmath8-dimensional hypersphere .",
    "hence @xmath152 will scale as the perimeter of such hypersphere _",
    "n ~n^(d-1)/d n 0 . similarly for @xmath200",
    "the low sites will form a shrinking hypersphere and @xmath201 for @xmath200 .",
    "hence it is reasonable to assume _ y b^d = b^d-1 ( y ) with @xmath202 for @xmath203 and @xmath204 for @xmath205 .",
    "the form of @xmath206 for intermediate values of @xmath207 is not known , but we expect it to be nonsingular and not dependent on @xmath22 . in conclusion ^2(b,_k ) = b^d+1 _ k with = _ 0 ^ 1 dy y ( 1-y ) ( y ) a finite geometrical constant .",
