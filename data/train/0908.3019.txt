    "the international linear collider ( ilc ) , colliding electrons and positrons , is envisaged by the particle physics community to be the next high energy accelerator for particle physics research .",
    "its centre of mass energy is planned to initially range from @xmath0 for physics runs and down to @xmath1 for calibration purposes , with the possibility of a later upgrade to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the ilc with its well - known momentum and spin state of the interacting particles will be complementary to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , providing capability of precise measurements of new physics phenomena and indirect studies of phenomena at energy scales well beyond the direct energy reach of both the ilc and lhc @xcite .",
    "overviews of the physics accessible at the ilc are given in the tesla technical design report @xcite and in the ilc reference design report @xcite .",
    "the complementarity of the ilc and the lhc has been investigated in detail by the lhc / ilc study group @xcite .",
    "extraction of new physics accessible at the ilc will rely not only on high quality of the colliding beams , but also on the use of hermetic , high - precision detector systems to record the signals of the products of the collisions , as well as excellent reconstruction software to analyse these events .",
    "since ilc physics is expected to be rich in final states with heavy flavour jets , it will be important to be able to distinguish @xmath3 jets , for which the leading hadron contains a bottom valence quark , from @xmath4 jets containing hadrons with a charm valence quark and jets arising from light ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) quark hadronisation .",
    "crucial for this `` flavour tag '' is the high precision measurement of the tracks of charged particles in the innermost detector system , the vertex detector , permitting reconstruction of the decay vertices of heavy flavour hadrons . as shown at previous experiments , a sufficiently precise and mechanically stable detector permits the reconstruction of both the primary vertex at the point where the particle beams collide , and the full decay chain in heavy flavour jets .",
    "for example , in a typical @xmath3 jet containing a @xmath8 hadron decay @xmath9 away from the interaction point ( ip ) , resulting in a @xmath10 hadron that decays , e.g. , @xmath11 further away , it is often possible to reconstruct all three vertices from the tracks in the jet .",
    "jet flavour identification is aided by observables derived from these vertices , such as the mass and momentum of the leading hadron that decayed .",
    "further , measurement of the vertex charge permits one to determine if the heavy flavour parton is a quark or an antiquark , opening up a range of measurements that would otherwise be inaccessible .",
    "the lcfivertex package provides software for vertex finding , flavour tagging and vertex charge reconstruction . in the current phase of ilc detector research and development ,",
    "the code is intended for the optimisation of the vertex detector design .",
    "furthermore , it is currently being used for optimisation of the overall ilc detector concepts , which requires flavour tagging in order to study the benchmark physics processes chosen to assess the performance of different detector designs .",
    "this paper describes the functionality provided by the lcfivertex package , as well as the performance achieved for a typical ilc vertex detector design .",
    "emphasis is on the algorithms ; further technical information can be found in the software documentation @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the vertex detector design used for the performance examples and the software framework to which the lcfivertex code is interfaced are described in the remainder of this section .",
    "section [ sectiontrackselection ] describes the track selection used for the different parts of the code ; in particular , the algorithms to suppress tracks stemming from photon conversions in the tracking volume and from the decay of short - lived @xmath12 and @xmath13 hadrons are described .",
    "section [ sectionzvtop ] explains the vertex finding algorithms , section [ sectionflavourtag ] the flavour tag and neural net software on which the flavour tagging approach relies and section [ sectionquarkcharge ] the algorithm for quark charge reconstruction .",
    "examples of the resulting performance for a typical detector design , using a sample of @xmath14 with @xmath15 at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath16 , unless otherwise stated , are presented in addition to the algorithms .",
    "section [ sectionsummary ] gives a summary of the paper .",
    "software versions and parameter settings used to produce the results in this paper are described in appendices a ",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained with the detector model ` ldcprime_02sc ` @xcite .",
    "this detector design evolved from the earlier tesla detector geometry @xcite and was implemented in a geant4-based detector simulation by the ldc ( `` large detector concept '' ) study group .",
    "it relies mostly on a pixel - based silicon vertex detector and a time projection chamber ( tpc ) to provide charged particle tracking .",
    "these detectors are located inside a solenoid which provides a magnetic field of @xmath17 . also inside the solenoid",
    "are fine grained electromagnetic ( ecal ) and hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeters .",
    "additional tracking and calorimetry is foreseen in the forward region , which is particularly important at ilc energies , given that many of the relevant physics processes are expected to give rise to multi - jet final states with at least one jet in the forward direction .",
    "the tracking detector layout of the ` ldcprime_02sc ` detector model is shown in figure  [ figuredetectormodel ] .",
    "( 0.95,0.5 ) ( 0.05,0 ) ( 0.45,0.26)tpc ( 0.0,0.02)vtx ( 0.015,0.075)sit ( 0.15,-0.01)ftd13 ( 0.54,0.02)ftd47    the vertex detector geometry in ` ldcprime_02sc ` consists of five barrel layers of silicon sensors evenly spaced between the inner radius of @xmath18 and the outer radius of @xmath19",
    ". the length of the active area is @xmath20 for the outer four layers and @xmath21 for the innermost layer .",
    "the number of sensor staves per layer ranges between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "sensors are assumed to be mounted onto a carbon fibre support structure , with the combined material budget of sensor and support structure corresponding to @xmath24 of a radiation length per layer . as carbon fibre is not among the materials available in geant",
    ", the support is described as a @xmath25 thick layer of graphite in the simulation . at the ends of the barrel staves ,",
    "the amount of material is larger due to the electronics and mechanical fixtures needed . in the barrel region , the silicon intermediate tracker ( sit ) , consisting of two layers of silicon sensors located at radii @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , helps link the track segments measured in the vertex detector to those provided by the tpc . in the detector design",
    "considered , the tpc drift region has an inner radius of @xmath28 , an outer radius of @xmath29 and a half - length of @xmath30 . in the forward direction , tracking is complemented by a silicon strip detector , the forward track detector ( ftd ) , comprised of @xmath31 disks located at @xmath32 positions ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 with inner radii between @xmath35 and @xmath36 and outer radii between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the inner radius of the silicon - tungsten ecal is @xmath39 and its outer radius is @xmath40 .",
    "the ecal is surrounded by an iron - scintillator hcal with an inner radius of @xmath41 .",
    "calorimeter cells are squares with sides of length @xmath9 in the ecal and @xmath42 in the hcal . in the forward region ,",
    "an ecal endcap extends from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , followed by an hcal from @xmath45 .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained with input from the pythia event generator @xcite .",
    "the detector response was simulated using the geant4-based @xcite program mokka @xcite and the detector model ` ldcprime_02sc ` , described above .",
    "the linear collider i / o ( lcio ) persistency framework @xcite permits storage of results between the stages of detector simulation , event reconstruction and physics analysis , and the exchange of these results between the different software frameworks used for ilc detector optimisation .",
    "one of the main roles of lcio is to provide a common data model , in which an ` event ` entity holds collections of objects relevant to the different stages of reconstruction , as well as some of the monte carlo ( mc ) information from the event generator .",
    "reconstruction was performed using tools from the marlinreco event reconstruction package @xcite , based on the particle flow concept and implemented within the modular c++ application framework marlin @xcite .",
    "the modules are called `` processors '' in this framework and can be configured by steering files in xml format .",
    "specific marlinreco processors were used to simulate the digitization in the different detector subsystems . in the case of the silicon - based detectors , the physical processes occurring in the silicon sensors , such as the drift of the electrons and holes that give rise to the signals ,",
    "are described using simple parameterisations .",
    "track finding , including pattern recognition , and track fitting was then performed using the ` fullldctracking ` processor @xcite .",
    "calorimeter clusters and tracks are matched using a particle flow algorithm ( pfa ) .",
    "for this purpose , the pandorapfa code @xcite was used , resulting in a collection of ` reconstructedparticles ` .",
    "these are the entities in lcio on which analyses are usually based , and which are used , for example , as the input to jet finding algorithms .",
    "the lcfivertex code is run on jets , and hence for studies in the context of pfa - oriented detectors , like the one described here , requires the pfa code to be run before the jet finding step .",
    "calorimeter clusters are required by the pfa algorithm as part of the input , and therefore also need to be reconstructed before this algorithm can be run . via the jet energy ,",
    "calculated in the pfa code , calorimeter clusters are indirectly used for the flavour tag .",
    "otherwise , the lcfivertex code is independent of the calorimeter information and only accesses the tracks in the input jets .",
    "it was checked that when running a different particle flow algorithm available in marlinreco , wolf @xcite , flavour tagging performance did not change . the durham @xmath46-cluster jet finding algorithm , as implemented in the ` satorujetfinder ` package in marlinreco @xcite , was then run , forcing each event into a two - jet topology .",
    "tracks from photon conversions , @xmath13 and @xmath12 decays were identified by a conversion tagger that forms part of lcfivertex , see section [ subsectionconversiontagger ] .",
    "these tracks were excluded from the input passed to the lcfivertex processors .    a simple processor to determine the event vertex or interaction point ( ip ) from an iterative fit to a subset of all tracks in an event was run .",
    "this ip - fit processor and the conversion tagger are the only parts of the lcfivertex package that are not jet - based .",
    "the resulting event vertex is used both by the vertex finding algorithms described below and for the flavour tag to determine a track s point of closest approach to the ip .",
    "the default flavour tag procedure implemented in the lcfivertex package , as described in more detail in section [ sectionflavourtag ] , uses secondary vertex information whenever available .",
    "different neural networks with separate sets of input variables are used depending on whether secondary vertices are found or not . in particular , for distinguishing @xmath4 jets from @xmath47 jets , a useful criterion is that @xmath47 jets do not contain vertices stemming from the decays of heavy flavour hadrons .",
    "it must therefore be ensured that the vertex finder creates as few fake vertices from wrong track combinations as possible .",
    "this can partly be achieved by appropriate track selection , as discussed in section [ subsectionconversiontagger ] .",
    "other potential sources of unwanted vertices for the purpose of flavour tagging are photon conversions in the detector material and the decay of @xmath13 and @xmath12 particles , which can resemble a heavy flavour decay vertex . as these effects have clear signatures , such tracks can easily be identified and suppressed by the track selection .",
    "[ [ subsectionconversiontagger ] ] identification of tracks from photon conversions , @xmath13 and @xmath12 decays ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    a dedicated marlin processor is used to identify tracks from @xmath13 and @xmath12 decays and from photon conversions .",
    "all two - track combinations are considered as candidates and are required to pass the following criteria to be identified as conversions or @xmath13/@xmath12 decays :    * the constituent tracks must have opposite charge sign . * the distance of closest approach between the two track helices must not exceed @xmath48 . * the distance between the point of closest approach and the ip must be larger than @xmath48 in order to reduce the risk of fake tags consisting of combinations of primary vertex tracks . * the invariant mass of the two track combination has to be compatible with that of the photon , the @xmath13 or the @xmath12 .    to check the mass compatibility ,",
    "the rest mass of the combination is calculated using three mass hypotheses , choosing the masses of the decay products accordingly : both tracks are assumed to be electrons in the case of conversions , or pions for the @xmath13 hypothesis , and for the @xmath12 hypothesis , the track with larger momentum is assigned the proton mass and the other the pion mass .",
    "the resulting rest mass of the combination is considered to be compatible with the hypothesis if it differs from the pdg value by not more than @xmath49 for conversions and kaons and by not more than @xmath50 for lambdas .",
    "table  [ tableconvtagperformance ] lists performance figures for each particle type separately .",
    ".__performance of the conversion , @xmath51 and @xmath12 identification .",
    "the efficiency is normalised to particles where all conversion respectively decay tracks were reconstructed in the detector , i.e.  to particles that could potentially lead to reconstruction of additional vertices .",
    "the purity is defined as the fraction of reconstructed conversion/@xmath51/@xmath12 candidates with a correct combination of tracks .",
    "selection cuts for each particle type were chosen to optimise flavour tag performance , not to optimise standalone performance of the conversion/@xmath51/@xmath12 tagger . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        ilc global design effort and world wide study , j.  brau ( ed . ) et al . , ilc reference design report ( rdr ) , slac - r-857 ( 2007 ) .",
