    "the main motivation of this article is the presence of spiral waves in excitable media , especially in cardiac tissue .",
    "spiral waves arise as stable spatio - temporal patterns in various chemical , physical systems and biological systems , as well as numerical simulations of reaction - diffusion systems on excitable media with various geometries .",
    "excitable media are extended non - equilibrium systems having a uniform rest state that is linearly stable but susceptible to finite perturbations .",
    "spiral waves have been observed experimentally , for instance , in catalysis of platinum surfaces @xcite , belousov - zhabotinsky chemical reactions @xcite , rayleigh - bernard convection @xcite , slime - mould cells @xcite and the most important , cardiac tissue @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the spiral waves have been done by @xcite , for example .",
    "+ it is now believed that spiral and scroll waves that appear in the heart muscle can lead to cardiac arrhythmias ( abnormal rhythms in the heart ) , giving rise to atrial fluttering or ventricular fibrillation . in normal hearts cardiac arrhythmias are rare , but in diseased hearts cardiac arrhythmias can become more common . for example , if chambers of the heart become abnormally large , they are susceptible to serious arrhythmias in which waves are believed to circulate in a fashion that is similar to the circulation of the belousov - zhabotinsky waves in a chemical medium .",
    "real human hearts are enormously complex three - dimensional structures . in this article",
    ", we assume that the geometry of the excitable media is a sphere , which in the case of cardiac tissue is clearly an approximation .",
    "+ in the planar case , a rigidly rotating spiral wave is an example of wave pattern rotating around a center and being well approximated by an archimedean spiral wave far from rotation center .",
    "near the rotation center , there is a core region of the spiral wave , where the front of the wave has a tip , whose structure is considered to be the most important in understanding the behavior of the whole spiral wave @xcite .",
    "barkley @xcite was the first who performed a numerical linear stability analysis for the basic - time periodic spiral wave solution in a reaction - diffusion system on the unbounded plane and showed evidence of a hopf bifurcation .",
    "in particular , a simple pair of eigenvalues was shown to cross the imaginary axis while three neutral eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis and the remainder of the spectrum is bounded into the left - half plane . later , using an ad hoc model , barkley @xcite was the first to realize the key importance of the group @xmath2 of all planar translations and rotations in describing the dynamics and bifurcations of planar spiral waves .",
    "+ it is well known now that the tip of the spiral wave rotates steadily or meanders or linearly drift in plane @xcite . from a mathematical point of view , rigidly rotating spiral waves are examples of rotating waves , meandering spiral waves are examples of modulated rotating waves and linearly drifting spiral waves are examples of modulated rotating waves .",
    "+ the first rigorous mathematical theory of the planar spiral waves was done by wulff @xcite . in her thesis ,",
    "wulff studied the external periodic forcing of rotating waves which leads to modulated rotating waves or modulated travelling waves , and also proved an @xmath2-equivariant hopf theorem for the bifurcation from rotating waves to modulated ( rotating or travelling ) waves in autonomous systems .",
    "the external periodic forcing of rotating waves was studied using a contraction mapping theorem on scales of banach spaces , and the proof for the @xmath2-equivariant hopf theorem for rotating waves was based on liapunov - schmidt reduction on scales of banach spaces . in both cases",
    ", it is shown that modulated travelling waves emanate if the rotation frequency is a multiple of the external frequency , respectively the modulus of the eigenvalue leading to hopf bifurcation .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the fact that the group @xmath2 is noncompact and the action of @xmath2 on the usual spaces of functions is not smooth .",
    "the proofs in @xcite are based on the basic assumption that the linearization at the rotating wave in the co - rotating frame does not exhibit continuous spectrum near the imaginary axis .",
    "+ later , sandstede , scheel and wulff @xcite proved a finite - dimensional center bundle reduction theorem near a relative equilibrium @xmath3 of an infinite - dimensional vector field on a banach space @xmath4 on which acts a finite - dimensional lie group ( not necessarily compact ) .",
    "this generalizes krupa s results on bifurcation from relative equilibria @xcite , from compact groups to noncompact groups and from finite dimensions to infinite dimensions .",
    "using the results of @xcite , the hopf bifurcation from one - armed rotating spiral wave to meandering waves can be studied @xcite .",
    "+ in the case of a one - armed rotating spiral wave , the relative equilibrium @xmath5 is diffeomorphic to @xmath2 , which is diffeomorphic to @xmath6 . near hopf bifurcation ,",
    "the reduced differential equations on the center bundle @xmath7 are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the rotating wave @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath13 at @xmath14 and to the solution @xmath15 for the first two differential equations in ( [ e : intro0 ] ) .",
    "+ in case of a supercritical hopf bifurcation we have @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "it follows that for any small @xmath18 there is a meandering spiral wave which becomes a drifting linear wave if @xmath19 , for some @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the frequency that appears due to the hopf bifurcation and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 periodic solution of the third differential equation in ( [ e : intro0 ] ) that appears due to the supercritical hopf bifurcation for @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "similar results for m - armed spiral waves were also obtained . + in @xcite , a @xmath24-equivariant semilinear system of parabolic equations ( where @xmath24 is a finite - dimensional possibly non - compact lie group ) is studied . in particular , the periodic forcing of relative equilibria and resonant periodic forcing of relative equilibria to relative periodic orbits , as well as hopf bifurcation from relative equilibria to relative periodic orbits are treated using liapunov - schmidt reduction .",
    "resonant drift phenomena are also studied .",
    "then , these results are applied to the planar spiral waves .",
    "+ for the skew - product finite - dimensional system of differential equations on the center manifold near a relative equilibrium @xcite , the normal form method which further simplifies the system is presented in @xcite . the normal form for the case @xmath25 is obtained .",
    "then , the known results regarding the meandering and drifting of planar spiral waves are recovered , as well as new results regarding the relative homoclinic and heteroclinic trajectories to relative equilibria of @xmath2-actions . + in @xcite",
    ", scheel shows that for a large class of reaction - diffusion systems on the plane , m - armed spiral waves bifurcate from a homogeneous equilibrium when the latter undergoes a hopf bifurcation .",
    "this was done using spatial dynamics .",
    "+ all previous results are valid for planar spiral waves .",
    "the interest to consider spiral waves on non - planar surfaces is motivated by the applicability to problems in physiology , biology and chemistry .",
    "therefore , the study of spiral waves by experiments and numerical simulations of reaction - diffusion systems on a sphere have recently been undertaken . in the case of spiral waves on a sphere",
    ", the dynamics is expected to be quite different because any spiral wave starting from a rotating center can not end at a point .",
    "the number of tips of a wave front can not be odd , and therefore , the dynamics of spiral waves may acquire a new feature qualitatively different from the planar case . + the dynamics of spiral waves in an excitable reaction - diffusion systems on a sphere was numerically investigated by @xcite , and @xcite who employ a spectral method using spherical harmonics as basis functions .",
    "maselko @xcite , as well as maselko and showalter @xcite performed experiments with belousov - zhabotinsky chemical waves propagating on the surface of a sphere .",
    "they observed that a spiral wave winds outward from a meandering source at the north pole and undergoes self - annihilation as it winds into itself at the south pole .",
    "+ in @xcite , the evolution of spiral waves on a circular domain and on a spherical surface is studied by numerical integration of a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "two different asymptotic regimes are observed for both domains .",
    "the first regime is a rigid rotation of an excitation wave around the symmetry axis of the domain .",
    "the second one is a compound rotation including a drift of the rotation center of the spiral wave either along the boundary of the disk or along the equator of the sphere . in this case",
    "the shape of the wave and its rotation velocity are periodically changing in time .",
    "simplified analytical estimates are presented to describe the rigid rotation .",
    "+ in @xcite , numerical integration of an excitable reaction - diffusion system on a sphere is presented .",
    "the evolution of counter - rotating double spiral waves on the sphere is studied and it is shown that the tips of the spiral can either perform a meandering motion or rigidly rotate around a fixed center , depending on the system control parameter .",
    "it is observed that the rotation of the spiral wave on spherical surface is similar to that obtain on the planar surface , except that in the absence of the boundary on a spherical surface some parts of the wave can undergo self - annihilation in contrast to the spiral wave behavior on bounded planar surfaces .",
    "+ in @xcite , the evolution of spiral waves on a spherical surface is studied by integration of a reaction - diffusion system with a global feedback .",
    "it is shown that depending on intensity , sign , and/or time delay in the feedback loop a global coupling can be effectively used either to stabilize the rigid motion of a spiral wave or to completely destroy spiral waves and to suppress self - sustained activity in a confined domain of an excitable medium . + in @xcite , the dynamics of chemical spiral waves in an excitable reaction - diffusion system on a sphere is numerically investigated employing a spectral method using spherical harmonics as basis functions .",
    "different types of spiral waves symmetric or antisymmetric source - source or nearly antisymmetric source - nonsource have been obtained depending on whether the medium is homogeneous or inhomogeneous , and it has been observed that the tips can either rotate steadily or change their shapes .",
    "+ the influence of the topological constraints and the inhomogeneity in the excitability on the geometry and dynamics of spiral waves on a thin spherical shell of excitable media are presented in @xcite . also , rigidly rotating waves on spherical domains",
    "have been studied using kinematical theory by @xcite . + in @xcite , the geometrical stability of the symmetric counter - rotating spiral waves propagating on the unit sphere is studied . by the use of the eikonal equations , it is demonstrated that these solutions are stable under small perturbations normal to the wave front lying on a unit sphere .",
    "+ in @xcite , the authors showed that stationary rotating solutions on a sphere of the eikonal equation under some boundary conditions on tips must be symmetric with respect to the equator with spiral winding out from source tips at polar points . + in @xcite , using the eikonal approximation to a reaction - diffusion system on a sphere , the authors prove existence of a class of counter - rotating double spiral solutions which are highly asymmetric with respect to the equator .",
    "they also derive a power law , linking the angular rotation of the spiral waves with the velocity of plane waves in medium . + in @xcite , renardy considered bifurcations from rotating waves of semi - linear equations that are equivariant under a general compact lie group and applied his results to the laser equations .",
    "his results do not cover the resonance case , which will be covered in our paper .",
    "the theorems were proved using a generalized implicit function theorem on scales of banach spaces .",
    "+ in @xcite , rand examined modulated rotating waves in rotating fluids and applied his results to the taylor - couette problem , where modulated rotating waves , so called modulated wavy vortices occur .",
    "+ in this article we have studied only the trivial isotropy case , because as far as we are aware , there have been observed no m - spiral waves ( @xmath26 ) on spherical surfaces .",
    "also , in @xcite it was numerically verified that there is a critical size of the sphere below which self - sustained spiral waves can not exist .",
    "therefore , we use a sphere of an arbitrary , but fixed radius @xmath27 .",
    "+ in this article , we study non - resonant and resonant supercritical hopf bifurcation from a rotating wave .",
    "the relation between spiral waves and rotating waves , respectively modulated rotating waves will be presented somewhere else .",
    "while we have concentrated on the case of hopf bifurcation , it should be mentioned that we would obtain similar results for _ periodic forcing _ of a rotating wave .",
    "+ in section [ s : rds ] , we define the representation of the lie group @xmath0 on the usual function space .",
    "it is a smooth unitary representation on the fractional spaces relative to the appropriate sectorial operator .",
    "we also associate an @xmath0-equivariant semiflow to the reaction - diffusion system on a sphere , and we recall the notion of tip position function . in section [ s : rw_mrw ] , we recall the notions of relative equilibrium , relative periodic orbit , rotating wave and modulated rotating wave . we also define the notions of frequency vector of a rotating wave and primary frequency vector of a modulated rotating wave , and present some of their properties .",

    "<S> two main types of spatial - temporal patterns that can appear in such systems are rotating waves ( equilibrium in a co - rotating frame ) and modulated rotating waves ( periodic solution in a co - rotating frame ) . the transition from rotating waves to modulated rotating waves on spherical domains </S>",
    "<S> is explained via a supercritical hopf bifurcation from a rotating wave , @xmath0-symmetry and finite - dimensional equivariant center manifold reduction . </S>",
    "<S> the baker - campbell - haussdorff formula in the lie algebra @xmath1 is used to get reduced differential equations on @xmath1 , a formula for a primary frequency vector , as well as a formula for the periodic part associated to any modulated rotating wave obtained by a supercritical hopf bifurcation from a rotating wave . as a consequence , there are three types of motions for the tips of these modulated rotating waves . in the resonant case ( with two parameters ) , we obtain that the primary frequency vectors of a branch of these modulated rotating waves are generically orthogonal to the frequency vector of the initial rotating wave undergoing hopf bifurcation . +    _ _ equivariant center manifold , rotating wave , modulated rotating wave , hopf bifurcation </S>"
