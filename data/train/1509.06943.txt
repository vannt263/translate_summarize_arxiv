    "a complete understanding of the star formation process requires the ability to predict how the properties of young stars depend on their initial conditions . despite significant efforts ,",
    "a key observational problem remains : the reliable determination of the masses and ages of the youngest pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars once they become optically visible , after the main accretion phase .",
    "stellar masses are needed to investigate the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) and its possible dependence on the properties of the parent cloud . however , obtaining reliable stellar masses is a very difficult task .",
    "the only direct method is to use eclipsing binary systems where individual masses of the components can be obtained with great accuracy from the radial velocity and light curve .",
    "however , eclipsing systems for pms stars are rare .",
    "another commonly adopted procedure is to locate the stars in the hertzpung - russell ( hr ) diagram , using estimates of their effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "masses can be obtained by comparing their position in the hr diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks , assuming the chemical composition @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable advances have been made in our understanding of pms evolution @xcite .",
    "however , differences in the evolutionary tracks remain due to the different treatment of convection , different opacities and differences in the zero - point of the calculated ages .",
    "this results in considerable differences in mass estimates of single stars from their effective temperatures and luminosities . without adequate observational constraints ,",
    "it is impossible to determine the correct assumptions in the evolutionary model calculations .",
    "for this reason , it is very important to obtain independent determinations of pms masses and ages .    in this",
    "context , intermediate - mass pms stars ( with mass in the range 18 m@xmath3 , also called herbig ae / be stars ) are particularly useful .",
    "after the seminal work by @xcite , who established the locus of the theoretical instability strip in the hr diagram , it has become clear that these stars pulsate as @xmath1  sct variables ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , high - precision photometry from space missions such as _ most _ and _ corot _ showed that intermediate - mass pms stars can also pulsate as hybrid @xmath1  sct/@xmath2  dor stars @xcite or pure @xmath2  dor stars @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because the occurrence of low frequencies in @xmath1  sct stars ( i.e. hybrid pulsation ) was originally thought to be exceptional .",
    "however , _ kepler _",
    "observations have shown that all @xmath1  sct stars have low frequencies @xcite .",
    "the reason why the hybrid concept arose is due to the fact that the low frequencies attain sufficient amplitudes to be visible from the ground only in a narrow temperature range .",
    "the mechanism which drives low frequencies in hot @xmath1  sct stars is currently unknown .",
    "the additional information provided by pulsation can be used to construct detailed models of the varying internal structure of these stars as they contract toward the main sequence , in order to compare the predicted frequencies to the observed ones @xcite .",
    "the physics of pms stellar evolutionary models can therefore be tested .",
    "several efforts have recently been made to analyze the properties of known pms pulsators ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the analysis is hampered by several factors such as the uneven quality of the observational data ( ground and space time series data have very different properties ) , the lack of precise spectroscopically derived stellar parameters , the possibly different intrinsic properties of cluster and field pms pulsators , and difficulties in the treatment of rapidly rotating stars .    in this context ,",
    "pms pulsators belonging to clusters or associations are of particular interest , since the member stars share the same chemical composition , age and interstellar absorption , greatly simplifying the comparison between theory and observations .",
    "this is the case , for example , of ngc2264 , a well - studied cluster where 9 pms pulsators have been observed from space @xcite .",
    "the upper scorpius association ( usco ) is perhaps of even greater interest due to the large number of known a ",
    "f members @xcite and the availability of accurate individual distances based on _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .",
    "moreover , stellar parameters have been estimated for most of the member stars .",
    "usco is part of the larger scorpius - centaurus ( sco - cen ) association , a young ( @xmath4510 myr ) and relatively close ( @xmath4120150pc ) region of recent star formation @xcite that includes the upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl ) and lower centaurus - crux ( lcc ) .",
    "usco is the youngest of them and contains many intermediate - mass members , making it an ideal target to investigate the whole extension of the pms instability strip .",
    "indeed , its member stars are sufficiently bright ( @xmath5mag ) to acquire extremely precise photometry both from the ground and from space .",
    "due to the loss of a second spacecraft reaction wheel , the _ kepler _ satellite ended data collection in the original cygnus field after four years of continuous monitoring . by pointing near the ecliptic plane ,",
    "the _ kepler _ spacecraft is able to minimize pointing drift , acquiring data with much reduced photometric precision .",
    "this mode of operation is called the k2 project .",
    "the usco region falls partially within the field of view of the _ kepler _ satellite during the _ k2-c02 _",
    "campaign , becoming a primary target for our purposes . in this work we present the results of a search for pulsating pms stars among the usco member stars observed by _",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section 2 we describe the _ kepler _ data and the techniques of data reduction and analysis ; in section 3 we present the classification of the variables ; section 4 reports a the results of the spectroscopic follow up for a sample of interesting templates ; section 5 includes a discussion about the evolutionary status of the target stars ; section 6 reports a discussion of the properties of the pulsating stars .",
    "finally , a brief summary closes the paper .",
    "_ kepler _ observations usually consist of 30-min exposures ( long cadence or lc mode ) , but a few stars can be observed with 1-min exposures ( short cadence or sc mode ) .",
    "observations of 16 pms stars in usco , 7 of which were also observed in sc mode , were obtained by _",
    "kepler_. the _",
    "k2-c02 _ campaign started on 2014 aug 23 and ended on 2014 nov 10 , for a total duration of about 78.7d .",
    "the selected stars come from the lists of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of the selected stars range from a2 to f7 ( to embrace the entire @xmath1 sct and @xmath2 dor instability strips , taking also into account possible errors on the spectral type values by 1 - 2 subclasses or more ) .",
    "we also searched the _",
    "kepler k2 _ data archive at mast ( mikulski archive for space telescopes ) for additional a  f members of usco and found an additional 9 objects ( 2 in sc mode ) , mainly a0 stars , giving a total of 27 usco members .",

    ", the brightness of a target changes slowly as the star moves from its original location on the ccd until the thrusters are applied to bring the star back to its original location .",
    "the periodogram therefore shows strong peaks at about 4.08d@xmath11 and its harmonics , which corresponds to the frequency at which the thrusters are applied .",

    "a more sophisticated approach to correct the light curve was proposed by @xcite . in this technique",
    "the non - uniform pixel response function of the _ kepler _ detectors is determined by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft s pointing and removing the dependence .",
    "this leads to an improvement over raw sap photometry by factors of 25 , with noise properties qualitatively similar to _ kepler _ targets at the same magnitudes .",
    "there is evidence that the improvement in photometric precision depends on each target s position in the _ kepler _ field of view , with worst precision near the edges of the field .",
    "overall , this technique restores the median - attainable photometric precision within a factor of two of the original kepler photometric precision for targets ranging from 1015 magnitude in the _ kepler _ bandpass .",
    "this technique is implemented in the kepsff task within the pyke software suite .",
    "this is the method used in our analysis .",

    "problems in the low frequency regime may be expected given the image drift .",
    "it is therefore important to identify common frequencies in the periodograms which could be of instrumental origin or artefacts of the reduction process .",
    "most of the periodograms obtained from applying the @xcite technique have a peak at frequency @xmath12d@xmath11 which can be identified as an instrumental frequency . in many stars the peak at half this frequency , @xmath40.26d@xmath11 ,",
    "is also present .",
    "stars having this feature include epic202842502 , 203660895 , 203931628 , 204076987 , 204494885 , 204638251 , 204810792 and 205089268 .",
    "other artificial peaks are present and these must be recognized in order not to be misled in classifying the star as a variable . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , we have shown with dashed lines the frequencies that are likely of instrumental origin .",
    "these are the harmonics of @xmath12d@xmath11 and of 4.08d@xmath11 .",
    "as an essential first step , it is necessary to examine the periodograms and light curves of all stars in order to identify pulsating variables and other interesting objects .",
    "the only pulsating stars in the observed spectral range that can be safely identified are @xmath1  sct ( characterized by the presence of one or more high frequencies , i.e. frequencies in excess of about 5d@xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath2  doradus stars , which have multiple frequencies lower than about 5d@xmath11 , are difficult to identify with certainty .",
    "this arises because of the possibility of spurious instrumental frequencies in this range as well as irregular variability caused by circumstellar material which might be present in these young stars .",
    "furthermore , one can not ignore the possibility that many stars may have spots which have different frequencies due to differential rotation or finite lifetimes .",
    "bearing these difficulties in mind , our attempted classifications are presented in table  [ tabgen ] .",
    "five stars are definitely @xmath1  sct ( dsct ) variables : epic203931628 , 204175508 , 204372172 , 204494885 , and 204638251 . at a first look",
    "epic204399980 seems to be an irregular long - period variable .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the sc light curve and its periodogram ( fig .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig4 ] ) reveals a very likely @xmath1  sct pulsation with frequencies in the range 3040d@xmath11 superimposed over irregular variations on a longer time scale .",
    "this kind of photometric behaviour is typical of an herbig ae star and is caused by the partial obscuration of the star s photosphere by circumstellar material ( see section  [ evolutionary ] ) .",
    "we identify epic204054556 as a @xmath2  dor ( gdor ) variable .",
    "epic204492384 could be gdor , but it looks more like a rotational variable ( broad multiple peak at @xmath41.14d@xmath11 and harmonic at @xmath42.28d@xmath11 ) .",
    "the multiple close frequencies at @xmath4 1.14d@xmath11 can be attributed to differential rotation .",
    "similarly , epic205002311 might be a rotational variable because the harmonic is present , but this classification is uncertain due to the low amplitude and the significant noise in this part of the spectrum .",

    "even if epic204372172 has a smaller @xmath39 , the position in the hr diagram is consistent with that of the other stars , preventing us from finding any significant difference in age from the comparison with the isochrones .",

    "a possibility is that the relation @xmath43age found by @xcite is not always present in young clusters / associations @xcite .",
    "vice versa , and more likely , all the four pulsators of usco have approximately the same age , but epic204399980 somehow managed to maintain its disk for a longer time .",
    "this is not an unusual situation considering that actively accreting stars older than 6 - 8  myr and still surrounded by circumstellar disks have been found in populous clusters , such as ngc  6611 @xcite .    in any case",

    "interestingly , ngc  2264 is known to have a median age of @xmath43 myr , and a significant dispersion of the order of @xmath4  5 myr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". in the case of usco , the age difference of its members seems to be very small .",
    "however , looking at their distribution in the hr diagram shown in fig .  8 , we notice that there are several stars of usco that fall within the instability strip and that lie close to the 5  myr isochrone ( see the light green symbols ) .",
