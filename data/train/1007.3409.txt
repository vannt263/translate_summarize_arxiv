    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most extreme events in the universe , and have fascinated astronomers since their discovery forty years ago @xcite . until 2008 , only a small fraction of grbs had been detected at energies above the mev region ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 , gonzalez et al .",
    "2003 , giuliani et al .",
    "the @xmath0 gamma - ray space telescope was launched on june 11 , 2008 , and provides unprecedented energy coverage and sensitivity for the study of high - energy emission in grbs .",
    "it is composed of two instruments : the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) @xcite and the large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite .",
    "the gbm monitors the entire unocculted sky .",
    "it covers four decades in energy through the combination of 12 nai and 2 bgo scintillation detectors , which are sensitive in the energy ranges 8  kev to 1  mev and 150  kev to 40  mev , respectively .",
    "the lat is a pair conversion telescope which consists of @xmath3 arrays of silicon strip trackers and cesium iodide calorimeter modules covered by a segmented anti - coincidence detector designed to efficiently reject charged particle background events .",
    "the energy coverage of the lat instrument ranges from 20  mev to more than 300  gev , with a field of view of @xmath22.4  sr at 1  gev .",
    "after 18 months of operations , the lat instrument has detected 15 grbs at energies above 100  mev , including two short bursts .",
    "after grb  080825c @xcite and grb  080916c @xcite , grb  090217a is the third long burst which was firmly detected with the lat above 100  mev after triggering the gbm .",
    "section  [ sec : observations ] addresses the detection and localization of this burst , and presents the light curves from both instruments .",
    "the joint spectral analysis is described in section  [ sec : jointanalysis ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "the results are discussed in the context of other lat - detected long grbs and current theoretical models , and our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "at 04:56:42.56 utc on february 17@xmath4 2009 ( @xmath5 ) , the @xmath0 gbm triggered and located grb  090217a ( trigger 256539404 / 090217206 ) @xcite .",
    "this bright , long grb was detected by nai detectors numbers 6 to 11 which are located on one side of the spacecraft .",
    "four of these detectors exceeded the threshold and the gbm triggered on 256 ms timescale in the energy range 50 to 300 kev .",
    "the bgo detector located on the same side , b1 , detected emission up to @xmath21  mev .",
    "in fact , the emission from grb  090217a was so intense that it was detected through the spacecraft by most of the nai detectors and indeed the bgo detector ( b0 ) on the opposite side .",
    "+ the angle of grb  090217a to the lat boresight was 35@xmath6 , placing this bright , hard event firmly in the field of view .",
    "the gbm on - ground localization reported by von kienlin ( 2009 ) was unusually far ( @xmath29@xmath6 ) from the early lat localization @xcite .",
    "however , this was improved upon using a response table for spectrally hard , bright bursts such as grb  090217a which also accounts for saturation events .",
    "the final gbm position is ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) with a statistical error of @xmath21@xmath6 and a standard systematic uncertainty of 2@xmath63@xmath6 @xcite , and is consistent with the lat position .",
    "+ the light curves from the gbm and lat are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , sorted from top to bottom in order of increasing energy .",
    "the first two panels display the background - subtracted light curves for the nai and the bgo detectors .",
    "the first panel shows the sum of the counts of the three nai detectors ( n6 , n8 and n9 ) with the strongest signal in the 8260  kev band .",
    "the second panel shows the corresponding plot for the sum of both bgo detector counts , between 260  kev and 5  mev .",
    "grb  090217a features a structured light curve in the gbm energy band , with one major peak with substructures and many overlapping pulses .",
    "the burst duration estimates for the 8  kev to 1  mev range are t@xmath9@xmath1032.8  s , and t@xmath11@xmath1011.3  s. the lat light curves in the last three panels are described in section  [ subsubsec : latroie ] .",
    "grb  090217a did not trigger the lat onboard detection algorithm and was found through a blind search in the lat data by the on ground automated science processing ( asp ) pipeline @xcite . subsequently and independent of the asp analysis , the detection was confirmed by searches of the gbm location .",
    "the first step of this study is selecting the lat events belonging to the so - called ` transient ' class @xcite of the ` p6_v3 ' analysis .",
    "this selection provides a large effective area with a reasonable background rate adapted for burst detection and localization .",
    "+ the unbinned likelihood method for localization makes use of the lat point spread function ( psf ) on an event by event basis .",
    "the instrument response functions ( irfs ) have not been validated below 100  mev , thus we restrict this analysis to be above this spectroscopic threshold . following the methodology described in detail in @xcite , we computed the lat position of grb  090217a using the map of the test statistics ( ts ) , considering all transient events recorded above 100  mev between @xmath5 and @xmath5 + 37.5  s in a region of 15@xmath6 centered on the final gbm position .",
    "grb  090217a occurred at a relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath12@xmath253@xmath6 ) , thus the galactic emission contributes only a few percent of the total background .",
    "therefore , only an isotropic component , largely residual charged - particle events , was included in the background model .    to compute the detection significance and the localization error ,",
    "the ts values are interpreted in terms of the @xmath13 distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the best fit position is found to be ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , which is @xmath16 away from the early localization @xcite , with a ts@xmath17=89 corresponding to a 9.2  @xmath1 detection .",
    "the ts contours around this position yielded the 68% , 90% and 99% statistical error radii , respectively of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the relatively small inclination angle of grb  090217a in the lat field of view implies a negligible systematic error ( @xmath210.1@xmath6 ) .",
    "+ we also searched for a temporally extended emission above 100  mev , as observed in other lat long bright bursts , e.g. grb  080916c @xcite and grb 090902b @xcite .",
    "this unbinned likelihood analysis is based on the lat events belonging to the so - called ` diffuse ' class , which is suited to searches on longer time scales @xcite .",
    "grb  090217a remained within 60@xmath6 from the lat boresight until @xmath5 + 500  s , but no additional signal was found by this time .",
    "finally , despite swift target of opportunity observations of the early lat localization , no x - ray afterglow was found @xcite and hence there is no redshift available for this burst .      unlike the unbinned likelihood analysis ,",
    "the joint gbm - lat spectral study and the study of the burst temporal profile in the lat do not make use of the lat psf on an event by event basis . in these analyses ,",
    "an increased signal - to - background ratio is obtained for the lat by selecting the events in a region of interest ( roi ) centered on the final lat position . as described in @xcite , its size ( @xmath22 )",
    "is energy dependent , and is obtained as the @xmath23 containment radius of the lat psf added in quadrature to the lat localization error .",
    "we split the lat transient events into ` front ' and ` back ' data sets , respectively including the events which converted in the upper and lower part of the tracker , thus with different psf widths @xcite .",
    "we used a maximum size @xmath24=10@xmath612@xmath6 for these two conversion types , which makes the size of the roi saturate between 100  mev and 200  mev in both cases .",
    "all events resulting from this selection process are shown in the last two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] . the events above 100  mev will be used for the joint gbm - lat spectral analysis in section  [ sec : jointanalysis ] .",
    "they are displayed in the last panel along with their energies as a function of time .",
    "a 447  mev event is detected at @xmath2@xmath5 while the lat event with the highest energy ( 866  mev ) arrives at @xmath5 + 14.8  s. additional events are recorded up to @xmath230  s after the trigger time . +",
    "the study of the temporal profile of the lat emission which is discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] requires good photon statistics . in the case of grb  090217a ,",
    "this can be achieved by including events recorded at lower energies , i.e. the 27 transient events above 50  mev which are displayed in the fourth panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] . as in @xcite ,",
    "the expected number of background events is computed by a procedure developed by the lat collaboration to quantitatively estimate levels of residual charged - particle backgrounds .",
    "this estimator was found to provide accurate values of the transient background level above 50  mev within a 10%15% systematic uncertainty .",
    "the computation of the probability that the observed number of counts is due to a background fluctuation is performed in a frequentist way , with a semi bayesian treatment of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the time history of the corresponding cumulative significance for the gamma - ray signal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probs ] . as in @xcite",
    ", we also used a relaxed event selection , considering all lat events that passed the onboard gamma filter .",
    "most of these events have at least a well - reconstructed track in the tracker , thus providing a rough direction measurement .",
    "the corresponding psf was found to be much worse than for the transient class , with a 68% containment radius of @xmath220@xmath6 , @xmath213@xmath6 and @xmath27@xmath6 at 20  mev , 50  mev and 100  mev , respectively .",
    "however , applying an additional spatial selection based on the 68% containment angles for this psf reduced the background from @xmath2300  hz to @xmath216  hz .",
    "the background - subtracted light curve obtained with this loosened event selection is shown in the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , and the time history of its cumulative significance is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : probs ] .",
    "simultaneous spectral fits of the gbm and lat data were performed for each of the three time bins ( a to c ) shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] .",
    "the selected boundaries reflect the time characteristics of gbm features and lat photons .",
    "the first time bin ( a ) starts 256  ms before the gbm trigger time in order to include the first lat ( 447  mev ) event , and lasts up to @xmath5 + 3.072  s. the central time bin ( b ) starts at @xmath5 + 3.072  s up to @xmath5 + 12.672  s , i.e. until the end of the main lat emission .",
    "the last bin ( c ) starts at @xmath5 + 12.672  s and ends at @xmath5 + 37.504  s , covering the tail of the lat and gbm emission .",
    "the 15 total events selected in the lat are displayed in the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] . as in section  [ subsubsec : latdetection ] , we used a spectroscopic threshold of 100  mev to avoid any spurious result due to systematic uncertainties in the lat irfs .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed with the software package rmfit ( version 3.1 ) , using binned gbm tte data and selected lat front and back events ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead of a @xmath13",
    ", we used the castor c - statistic @xcite to simultaneously fit the combined data sets due to the small number of events at the highest energies .",
    "the castor statistic is similar to the cash statistic @xcite , except for an offset which is constant for a particular data set .",
    "all time - resolved count spectra are well fit by a band function , which consists of two smoothly - connected power laws @xcite .",
    "[ fig : countspectrum ] displays the time - averaged count spectrum , which spans five decades in energy and is also well reproduced by a band model .",
    "the source photon spectral energy distributions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : nufnu ] with their 68% confidence level contours .",
    "the best fit model parameters are reported in table  [ table : results ] with their statistical errors along with the energy fluxes in the 20  kev  2  mev and 100  mev ",
    "10  gev energy bands .",
    "the systematic errors on these parameters are essentially dominated by the uncertainty on the effective areas of the instruments . in @xcite",
    ", we found a @xmath2515% systematic uncertainty on the amplitude @xmath26 , @xmath250.03 for the spectral slopes @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath258  kev for the peak energy @xmath29 .",
    "for grb  090217a , these uncertainties are negligible for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while they are comparable to the statistical errors for @xmath27 and dominant for @xmath26 .    whereas the time evolution of the amplitude and @xmath29 shows the same trend as the overall intensity of the burst , as observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , the low - energy slope ( @xmath27 ) becomes gradually softer and the high - energy slope ( @xmath28 ) remains constant within the quoted errors .",
    "in particular , the apparent hardening of @xmath28 between time bins ( b ) and ( c ) is not significant ( @xmath21.5  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the hardness ratio between the low- and high - energy fluxes is also found to be constant , with a mean value of @xmath30 for the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "grb  090217a does not exhibit any noticeable spectral feature , other than the common band spectral shape , similar to the first two long bursts detected by the lat , grb  080825c and grb  080916c .",
    "in all three bursts , no significant excess in the form of an additional spectral component , or a deficit in the form of a spectral cut off , was found in the lat energy range with respect to the extrapolation of the band spectrum from lower energies . in combination with correlated temporal behaviour of the low and high energies",
    ", this suggests that a single emission mechanism accounts for the radiation across all energy bands . in @xcite , we estimated the fluence ratio of the 100  mev  10  gev energy band to the 20  kev  2  mev energy band to be @xmath27% for grb  080825c and @xmath230% for grb  080916c .",
    "the ratio of @xmath23% found for grb  090217a places this burst in a similar range as grb  080825c .    beyond these obvious similarities , grb  090217a",
    "does not share several of the high - energy properties observed in the other two bursts .",
    "first of all , the onset of the high - energy emission of grb  090217a is not much delayed with respect to the @xmath2100  kev radiation , and a continuous increase of the high - energy flux is observed at early times , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lc ] and  [ fig : probs ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : probs ] also shows the time history of the cumulative significance for grb  080916c and grb  080825c . in spite of its brightness",
    ", grb  080916c is not detected within the first @xmath22 seconds , and then exhibits a very sharp rise between 3  s and 5  s. given the poor photon statistics from the transient event selection , we could not confirm the presence of a lag in the case of grb  080825c ( with a 3.4% chance probability ) , and simply noted that the first events recorded by the lat from this burst were coincident with the second gbm peak @xcite .",
    "the light curve obtained with a loosened event selection confirms the absence of any excess at early times with a higher significance .",
    "grb  080825c is significantly detected ( @xmath315  @xmath1 ) only after @xmath24  s , with the bulk of its emission slowly accumulating up to 9  @xmath1 within the next @xmath225 seconds .",
    "grb  090217a has a smoother evolution and the delayed onset of its emission in the lat energy band is much less marked .",
    "it is marginally seen from the first instants and significantly detected after only @xmath23  s. it reaches its maximum between 10  s and 15  s and does not last longer than the low - energy emission .",
    "this is the opposite to what was observed for the other two bursts : grb  080916c showed evidence for a long lasting lat emission up to 1.4  ks , while grb  080825c emission lasted somewhat longer in the lat ( up to @xmath5 + 35  s ) than in the gbm ( with a @xmath32=27  s ) , with the highest energy photon arriving when the gbm emission was very weak . in @xcite , we discussed the latter result as a possible detection of a separate and harder component showing up at late times . finally , no strong spectral evolution was observed in grb  090217a especially at the highest energies , unlike grb  080916c which underwent a strong soft - hard - soft evolution .",
    "while other long lat - detected bursts such as grb  080825c and grb  080916c exhibit a high - energy spectral variability associated to a delayed onset of the lat emission along with a temporally extended emission , grb  090217a is a firmly lat - detected burst with featureless high - energy properties .",
    "the similarity of the temporal history of its gamma - ray emission over five decades in energy and the agreement , within the observational errors , between measured spectra with the band model suggest that a single mechanism is responsible for the observed broad - band emission .    as in the case of grb  080916c",
    ", a simple leptonic mechanism appears to be the most straightforward choice to reproduce the observed emission , e.g. synchrotron emission or jitter radiation @xcite .",
    "the low - energy spectral slope of all three time bins is compatible with a synchrotron mechanism @xcite , and the mild soft to hard to soft variation of @xmath29 could be due to episodes of different shell collisions leading to shocks with different parameters .",
    "more complicated scenarios are possible but not required by the present observations .",
    "observations of more , and brighter , grbs with both gbm and lat in the near future will certainly help to assess what fraction of high - energy emitting bursts share similar properties , and to clarify the dominant emission mechanisms as well as the particle acceleration and cooling processes occurring in grb jets .",
    "the @xmath0 lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
