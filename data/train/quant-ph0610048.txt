    "quantum cryptography , that is , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) followed by one - time pad , is one of the most important quantum information applications .",
    "the existing cryptographic methods using classical resources base their security on technical assumptions on the eavesdropper , often called eve , capabilities , such as finite computational power or bounded memory @xcite .",
    "contrary to all these schemes , the security proofs of qkd protocols , e.g. the bb84 protocol @xcite , do not rely on any assumption on eve s power : they are simply based on the fact that eve s , as well as the honest parties devices are governed by quantum theory @xcite . thus , well - established quantum features , such as the monogamy of quantum correlations ( entanglement ) or the impossibility of perfect cloning @xcite , make qkd secure .",
    "actually , any possible quantum attack by eve would introduce errors and modify the expected quantum correlations between the honest parties , alice and bob .",
    "the amount of these errors can be estimated using public discussion , so the honest parties can judge whether their quantum channel can be used for secure qkd , or abort the insecure transmission otherwise .",
    "the monogamy of entangled quantum states ( see @xcite ) can be simply illustrated in the scenario where two distant parties know to share a two - qubit maximally entangled state , the so - called _ ebit _ , @xmath2 since the state is pure , it can not be correlated with a third eavesdropping party .",
    "so , alice and bob can safely map their ebit into a _",
    "secret bit _ by just measuring in the computational bases ( see , fig .",
    "( [ qcdist ] ) ) .",
    "it is meant by secret bit a random bit shared by alice and bob that is uncorrelated to eve , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the probability distribution describing alice , bob and eve s correlations .",
    "then , a simple qkd protocol could consist of alice locally preparing a state @xmath6 , sending half of this state through the channel to bob , and then measuring in the computational bases .",
    "however , any realistic channel between alice and bob is in general noisy , so the state sent by alice interacts with the environment and is transformed into a mixed state , @xmath7 . as a consequence of the noisy interaction with the environment ,",
    "alice and bob measurement outcomes are no longer perfectly correlated .",
    "the honest parties then should know how to deal with errors .",
    "they should safely assume that eve has the power to control all the environment , so all the errors are due to her interaction with the sent states : the larger the observed error rate , the larger eve s information .",
    "entanglement distillation protocols @xcite offer a possible solution to the problem of errors or decoherence in the quantum channel .",
    "it is a technique that allows two separate parties to transform by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) many copies of a known entangled mixed state into a fewer number of pure ebits .",
    "these ebits can later be consumed to establish secret bits",
    ". however , entanglement distillation protocols are by far not feasible with present - day technology .",
    "this is because they require the use of a quantum memory , a device able to store quantum states , and controlled coherent operations .",
    "both techniques turn out to be experimentally very challenging .",
    "however , in order to establish secret bits , alice and bob do not necessarily have to go through entanglement distillation .",
    "a much more feasible family of protocols consist of the honest parties measuring their quantum states at the single - copy level and then applying classical distillation techniques to the obtained measurement outcomes .",
    "we denote these _ single - copy measurements plus classical processing _ protocols as simcap @xcite .",
    "actually , it is well known that in the case of simcap protocols , the honest parties do not have to use entanglement at all for the correlation distribution @xcite .",
    "indeed , alice s preparation of the entangled two - qubit state plus measurement can be replaced by the preparation of a one - qubit state that is sent trough the noisy channel to bob , who later measures it .",
    "that is , any simcap protocol in the entanglement picture is equivalent to a _ prepare and measure _ scheme @xcite , which is much more feasible from an applied point of view .",
    "the bb84 and the six - state @xcite protocols constitute known examples of _ prepare and measure _ qkd schemes .",
    "+    independently of the type of measurements or distillation techniques employed in the protocol , a first and crucial step in any qkd scheme consists of a _ tomographic process _ by alice and bob to obtain information about their connecting quantum channel . by means of this process , alice and bob should conclude whether the _ secrecy properties _ of their channel are sufficient to run a qkd protocol . in the standard formulation , the cryptographic properties of quantum channels",
    "are referred to a specific protocol . for instance , a standard problem is to determine the critical quantum bit error rate ( qber ) in the channel such that key distillation is possible using one- or two - way distillation techniques using the bb84 protocol .",
    "however , it appears meaningful to identify and quantify the cryptographic properties of a quantum channel by itself , independently of any pre - determined qkd protocol .",
    "indeed , this is closer to what happens in reality , where the channel connecting alice and bob is fixed .",
    "therefore , after the tomographic process , the two honest parties should design the protocol which is better tailored to the estimated channel parameters . in this sense",
    ", it is well known that no secure qkd can be established using entanglement - breaking channel @xcite , while the detection of entanglement already guarantees the presence of some form of secrecy @xcite . beyond these two results , little",
    "is known about which channel properties are necessary and/or sufficient for secure qkd .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the cryptographic properties of quantum channels when alice and bob employ qkd schemes where ( i ) the correlation distribution is done using prepare and measure techniques and ( ii ) the key distillation process uses the standard one - way and two - way classical protocols .",
    "indeed , these are the techniques presently used in any realistic qkd implementation .",
    "it should be clear , then , that none of the protocols considered here require the use of entangled particles .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we perform our analysis in the completely equivalent entanglement picture . as it becomes clearer below , the problem then consists of identifying those quantum states that can be distilled into secret bits by simcap protocols restricted to the known distillation techniques .",
    "a first step in this direction has recently been given in @xcite .",
    "there , a rather easily computable and powerful necessary condition for secure qkd is derived , which is shown to be sufficient against the so - called collective attacks ( see below ) . in general , the derived necessary condition is more restrictive than the entanglement condition . in this work ,",
    "we first rederive the security condition of @xcite , improving the security analysis .",
    "since collective attacks have been proven to be as powerful as general attacks @xcite , our condition actually applies to any attack .",
    "we show how to apply this condition to the standard bb84 and six - state protocols .",
    "next , we explore several possibilities to improve the obtained security bounds .",
    "remarkably , all these alternatives fail , which suggests the existence of non - distillable entangled states under general simcap protocols .",
    "then , we move to higher dimensional systems , also called _ qudits _ , and extend the results to generalized bell diagonal qudit channels .",
    "the obtained security condition turns out to be tight for the so - called @xmath8- and 2-bases protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secprot0 ] defines what we call _ realistic _ protocols . in section [ secattacks ] ,",
    "we introduce and classify several eavesdropping attacks . exploiting the connection between qkd and the de finetti theorem established by renner @xcite , we can restrict the security analysis to the so - called collective attacks , where eve applies the same interaction to each quantum state . then , we briefly review some of the existing security bounds for the two most commonly used prepare and measure protocols , bb84 and six - state ( section [ revbounds ] ) . in the next section , we derive the announced security condition for qubit channels and apply it to the two mentioned protocols .",
    "we then show that neither pre - processing nor coherent quantum operations by one of the parties improves the obtained security bounds . in section [ secqudits ]",
    ", we move to higher dimensional systems , extending the security conditions to generalized bell diagonal channels .",
    "then , we apply this condition to the @xmath8- and 2-bases protocols of @xcite , which can be understood as the natural generalization to qudits of the bb84 and the six - state protocols , and prove the tightness for these protocols .",
    "finally , section [ secconcl ] summarizes the main results and open questions discussed in this work .",
    "most of the technical details are left for the appendices .",
    "there exist plenty of qkd protocols in the literature . here ,",
    "we restrict our considerations to what we call realistic protocols where alice prepares and sends states from a chosen basis to bob , who measures in another ( possibly different ) basis .",
    "this establishes some classical correlations between the two honest parties .",
    "of course this process alone is clearly insecure , since eve could apply an intercept resend strategy in the same basis as alice s state preparation , acquiring the whole information without being detected .",
    "therefore , from time to time , alice and bob should change their state preparation and measurements to monitor the channel and exclude this possibility .",
    "alice and bob announce these symbols to extract information about their channel , so these instances do not contribute to the final key rate .",
    "indeed these symbols are waisted in the tomographic process previously mentioned .",
    "however , in the limit of large sequences , the fraction of cases where alice and bob monitor the channel can be made negligible in comparison with the key length , but still sufficient to have a faithful description of some channel parameters , such as the qber @xcite .",
    "the states sent by alice will be transformed into a mixed state because of eve s interaction .",
    "this decoherence will produce errors in the measurement values obtained by bob .",
    "the security analysis aims at answering whether the observed decoherence in the channel is small enough to allow alice and bob distilling a secret key .",
    "we call these protocols realistic in the sense that they do not involve experimentally difficult quantum operations , such as coherent measurements , quantum memories or the generation of entangled particles .",
    "the establishment of correlations is done by just generating one - qubit states and measuring them in two or more bases .",
    "additionally , one could think of including a filtering single - copy measurement on bob s side . this operation is harder than a standard projective measurement , but still feasible with present - day technology @xcite .",
    "the above scenario can be explained in the completely equivalent entanglement - based scenario @xcite , that turns out to be much more convenient for the theoretical analysis . in the entanglement - based scheme ,",
    "the information encoding by alice is replaced by generating and measuring half of a maximally entangled state .",
    "that is , alice first locally generates a maximally entangled two - qubit state and sends half of it to bob through the channel .",
    "a mixed state @xmath7 is then shared by the two honest parties , due to the interaction with the environment controlled by eve .",
    "now , alice and bob measure in two bases to map their quantum correlations into classical correlations .",
    "for instance , if alice and bob measure in the computational bases , the qber simply reads _",
    "ab = 01 |_ab|01 + 10 |_ab| 10 .",
    "it can be imposed that alice s local state can not be modified by eve , since the corresponding particle never leaves alice s lab , which is assumed to be secure .",
    "it has to be clear that the techniques of @xcite imply the equivalence between simcap protocols on entangled states and prepare and measure qkd schemes : the correlation distribution is , from the secrecy point of view , identical .",
    "this equivalence , for instance , is lost if one considers entanglement distillation protocols for qkd , where the particles are measured by the honest parties after applying coherent quantum operations .",
    "+      after the correlation distribution , either using prepare and measure or simcap protocols , alice and bob share partially secret correlations to be distilled into the perfect key . the problem of distilling noisy and partially secret correlations into a secret key has not been completely solved . recently , general lower bounds to the distillable secret - key rate by means of error correction and privacy amplification using one - way communication have been obtained in @xcite . in case the correlations are too noisy for the direct use of one - way distillation techniques , alice and bob can before apply a protocol using two - way communication . the obtained correlations after this two - way process may become distillable using one - way protocols .",
    "much less is known about key distillation using two - way communication . here",
    "we mostly apply the standard two - way communication protocol introduced by maurer in @xcite , also known as classical advantage distillation ( cad ) . actually , we analyze the following two slightly different cad protocols :    * _ cad1 . _",
    "alice and bob share a list of correlated bits .",
    "alice selects @xmath9 of her bits that have the same value and publicly announces the position of these symbols .",
    "bob checks whether his corresponding symbols are also equal .",
    "if this is the case , bob announces to alice that he accepts , so they use the measurement values ( they are all the same ) as a bit for the new list .",
    "otherwise , they reject the @xmath9 values and start again the process with another block .",
    "_ alice locally generates a random bit @xmath10 .",
    "she takes a block of @xmath9 of her bits , @xmath11 , and computes the vector x = ( x_1,,x_n ) [ ab ] such that @xmath12 .",
    "she then announces the new block @xmath13 through the public and authenticated classical channel . after receiving @xmath13",
    ", bob adds it to his corresponding block , @xmath14 , and accepts whenever all the resulting values are the same . if not , the symbols are discarded and the process is started again , as above .",
    "these protocols are equivalent in classical cryptography and in the completely general quantum scenario .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown in section [ secineq ] that they are different in some particular , but still relevant , scenarios . in what follows",
    ", we restrict the analysis to key distillation protocols consisting of cad followed by standard one - way error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "thus , it is important to keep in mind that any security claim is referred to this type of key - distillation protocols .",
    "although these are the protocols commonly used when considering two - way reconciliation techniques , their optimality , at least in terms of robustness , has not been proven .",
    "after describing alice and bob s operations , it is now time to consider eve s attacks . with full generality , we suppose that eve has the power to control all the environment .",
    "that is , all the information that leaks out through the channel connecting alice and bob goes to eve , so all the decoherence seen by alice and bob is introduced by her interaction .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , eavesdropping strategies can be classified into three types : ( i )  individual , ( ii )  collective and ( iii )  coherent .",
    "once more , although most of the following discussion is presented in the entanglement picture , the same conclusions apply to the corresponding prepare and measure scheme .      in an individual attack eve",
    "is assumed to apply the same interaction to each state , without introducing correlations among copies , and measure her state right after this interaction . in this type of attacks , all three parties immediately measure their states , since no one is supposed to have the ability to store quantum states .",
    "therefore , they end up sharing classical - classical - classical ( ccc ) correlated measurement outcomes @xcite , described by a probability distribution @xmath5 . in this case , standard results from classical information theory can be directly applied .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the secret - key rate using one - way communication , @xmath15 , is bounded by so - called csiszr - krner bound @xcite , @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes the classical mutual information between the measurement outcomes @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",
    "it reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the standard shannon entropy . in this type of attacks ,",
    "eve s interaction can be seen as a sort of asymmetric cloning @xcite producing two different approximate copies , one for bob and one for her .",
    "this cloning transformation reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "it has been shown that in the case of two qubits , two honest parties can distill a secret key secure against any individual attacks whenever their quantum state @xmath7 is entangled @xcite .",
    "it is clear that to prove security against individual attacks is not satisfactory from a purely theoretical point of view .",
    "however , we believe it is a relevant issue when dealing with realistic eavesdroppers . assume eve s quantum memory decoherence rate is nonzero and the honest parties are able to estimate it .",
    "then , they can introduce a delay between the state distribution and the distillation process long enough to prevent eve keeping her states without errors .",
    "eve is then forced to measure her states before the reconciliation , as for an individual attack .",
    "collective attacks represent , in principle , an intermediate step between individual and the most general attack .",
    "eve is again assumed to apply the same interaction to each quantum state , but she has a quantum memory . in other words , she is not forced to measure her state after the interaction and can arbitrarily delay her measurement .",
    "in particular , she can wait until the end of the reconciliation process and adapt her measurement to the public information exchanged by alice and bob . after a collective attack ,",
    "the two honest parties share @xmath9 independent copies of the same state , @xmath23 , where no correlation exists from copy to copy . without losing generality ,",
    "the full state of the three parties can be taken equal to @xmath24 , where |_abe=(i_au_be)|^+_ab|e.after a collective attack , and the measurements by alice and bob , the three parties share classical - classical - quantum ( ccq ) correlations , described by a state @xmath25\\otimes[b]\\otimes[e_{ab } ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote alice and bob s measurement outcomes associated to the measurement projectors @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "square brackets denote one - dimensional projector , e.g. @xmath30 = |\\psi\\rangle \\langle\\psi|$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath31 $ ] is not normalized , since @xmath32 and @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the following result , obtained in @xcite , is largely used in the next sections . after a collective attack described by a state like ( [ collst ] ) , alice and bob s one - way distillable key rate satisfies k _ i(a : b ) - i(a : e ) .",
    "[ dw ] here , the correlations between alice and bob s classical variables are again quantified by the standard mutual information , @xmath17 .",
    "the correlations between alice s classical and eve s quantum variables , @xmath11 and @xmath34 , are quantified by the holevo quantity , @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the shannon entropy , so @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "actually the  same \" equation ( [ dw ] ) applies when bob is also able to store quantum states and the three parties share classical - quantum - quantum ( cqq ) correlations . in this case",
    ", both mutual information quantities between alice s classical variable , @xmath11 , and bob s and eve s quantum states , denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath34 , should be understood as holevo quantities @xcite .",
    "notice the similarities between ( [ ckbound ] ) and ( [ dw ] ) .",
    "indeed , the obtained bounds represent a natural generalization of the ck - bound to the ccq and cqq correlations scenarios .",
    "finally , one has to consider the most general attack where eve can perform any kind of interaction . in this case",
    ", alice and bob can not assume to share @xmath9 copies of the same quantum state .",
    "compared to the previous attacks , there did not exist nice bounds for the extractable key - rate under general attacks .",
    "however , very recently a dramatic simplification on the security analysis of qkd protocols under general attacks has been achieved by means of the so - called de finetti theorem @xcite .",
    "indeed , renner has proven that general attacks can not be more powerful than collective attacks in any protocol that is symmetric in the use of the quantum channel .",
    "this provides a huge simplification in security proofs , since by means of the de finetti arguments ( see @xcite for more details ) , alice and bob can safely assume to share @xmath9 copies of a quantum state consistent with their tomographic process , and then apply the existing bounds for this scenario .",
    "note that the de finetti theorem should also be employed if one wants to use entanglement distillation as a key distillation technique . in what follows , then",
    ", we can restrict our analysis to collective attacks , without underestimating eve s capabilities .",
    "finally , we would like to summarize the existing security bounds for the two most known qkd protocols , bb84 and six - state .",
    "these bounds are usually stated in terms of the critical qber such that key distillation is possible .",
    "of course , these bounds depend on the type of key distillation techniques employed by the honest parties . since the first general security proof of bb84 by mayers @xcite ,",
    "security bounds have been constantly improved . using a quantum error - correction ( of bit - flip and phase - inversion ) description of classical one - way error - correction and privacy amplification , shor and preskill showed the general security of bb84 whenever @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "later , lo adapted their proof to 6-state protocol obtaining a critical qber of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "more recently , kraus , renner , and gisin have improved these values by introducing some classical pre - processing by the two honest parties , obtaining critical qber s of @xmath41 for the bb84 and @xmath42 for the six - state protocol @xcite .",
    "more recently , the bound for bb84 has been improved up to @xmath43 in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the known upper bounds on the critical qber are slightly higher than these lower bounds , so the exact value for the critical qber remains as an open question .     and",
    "@xmath40 respectively .",
    "these bounds have later been improved by information - theoretic considerations up to @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the improvement is achieved using some classical pre - processing by one of the parties.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the honest parties however can apply cad to their outcomes before using one - way key - distillation techniques and improve these bounds .",
    "the whole process can now be mapped into a two - way entanglement distillation protocol .",
    "based on this analogy , gottesman and lo have obtained that secure qkd is possible whenever the qber is smaller than @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the bb84 and six - state protocol , respectively @xcite .",
    "chau has improved these bounds up to @xmath46 and @xmath1 respectively @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the formalism @xcite to two - way communication has also been done by kraus , branciard and renner @xcite .",
    "we show in the next sections ( see also @xcite ) that , for larger qber , no protocol consisting of cad followed by one - way distillation techniques works .",
    "so , contrary to what happens in the case of one - way communication , there is no gap between the lower and upper bounds for secure key distribution using the bb84 and six - state schemes , under the considered reconciliation techniques .     and @xmath45 respectively @xcite .",
    "later , chau improved the error correction method and the bounds are moved to @xmath46 and @xmath1 @xcite . in sections iv and v , we show that those bounds are tight .",
    "note that the key distillability condition is stronger than the entanglement condition , which is @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the bb84 and the six - state protocols.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "after reviewing the main ideas and previous results used in what follows , we are in position of deriving our results .",
    "consider the situation where alice and bob are connected by a qubit channel .",
    "alice locally prepares a maximally entangled state of two qubits and sends half of it through the channel .",
    "then , both parties measure the state . by repetition of this process ,",
    "they can obtain a complete , or partial , characterization of their channel , up to some precision .",
    "indeed , there exists a correspondence between a channel , @xmath49 , and the state @xmath50 now , the parties agree on a pair of bases , that will later be used for the raw key distribution .",
    "they repeat the same process but now measure almost always in these bases . however , with small probability , they have to change their measurement to the previous tomographic process in order to check the channel . after public communication , they discard the asymptotically negligible fraction of symbols where any of them did not use the right basis and proceed with the key distillation . in what follows ,",
    "we provide a security analysis of this type of schemes .",
    "two important points should be mentioned again : ( i ) as said , these schemes can be easily transformed into a prepare and measure protocol , without entanglement and ( ii ) using de finetti theorem , alice and bob can restrict eve to collective attacks .",
    "in other words , they can assume to share @xmath9 independent copies of the same state , @xmath23 , that is , the channel does not introduce correlation between the states .",
    "the goal , then , consists of finding the optimal simcap protocol for the state @xmath7 , or equivalently , the best prepare and measure scheme for the channel @xmath49 .    generically , @xmath7 can be any two - qubit state .",
    "however , no key distillation is possible from separable states , so alice and bob abort their protocol if their measured data are consistent with a separable state @xcite .",
    "we can assume , if the state preparation is done by alice , that her local state , @xmath51 , can not be modified by eve . in our type of schemes ,",
    "this state is equal to the identity .",
    "although our techniques can be used in the general situation , we mostly restrict our analysis to the case where bob s state is also equal to the identity .",
    "this is likely to be the case in any realistic situation , where the channel affects with some symmetry the flying qubits .",
    "this symmetry is reflected by the local state on reception , i.e. @xmath52 . in the qubit case",
    ", the fact that the two local states are completely random simply means that the global state @xmath7 is bell diagonal , @xmath53+\\lambda_2[\\phi_2]+      \\lambda_3[\\phi_3]+\\lambda_4[\\phi_4 ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 define the so - called bell basis . or in other words , @xmath49 is a pauli channel .",
    "pauli channels are very useful , as it will become clearer below , in the analysis of the bb84 and six - state protocols .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that alice and bob can always transform their generic state @xmath7 into a bell diagonal state by single - copy filtering operations .",
    "actually , this operation is optimal in terms of entanglement concentration .",
    "indeed , it maximizes the entanglement of formation of any state @xmath57 obtained after locc operations of a single copy of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this filtering operation succeeds with probability @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath7 is already in a bell - diagonal form , it remains invariant under the filtering operation .",
    "alternatively , alice and bob can also map their state into a bell diagonal state by a depolarization protocol , where they apply randomly correlated change of basis , but some entanglement may be lost in this process . in view of all these facts , in what follows we mainly consider bell diagonal states .    it is possible to identify a canonical form for these states .",
    "this follows from the fact that alice and bob can apply local unitary transformation such that _ 1= _ i _ i , _",
    "[ minmax ] indeed , they can permute the bell basis elements by performing the following operations t([_1 ] ) & = & 2 ^ -1i(-i_z ) ( -i_z ) , + t([_2])&=&2 ^ -1(_x+_z ) ( _ x+_z ) , + t([_3 ] ) & = & 2 ^ -1(+i_z ) ( -i_z ) . [ lu ] once the state has been casted in this canonical form , alice and bob measure it in the computational basis .",
    "the choice of the computational bases by alice and bob will be justified by our analysis .",
    "indeed , once a bell - diagonal state has been written in the previous canonical form , the choice of the computational bases seems to maximize the secret correlations between alice and bob , although , in general , they may not maximize the total correlations .    before alice and bob measurements , the global state including",
    "eve is a pure state that purifies alice and bob s bell diagonal state , that is ,    orthonormal basis on eve s space .",
    "all the purifications of alice - bob state are equivalent from eve s point of view , since they only differ from a unitary operation in her space . after the measurements , alice , bob and eve share ccq correlations . in the next sections we study",
    "when these correlations can be distilled into a secure key using the standard cad followed by one - way distillation protocols . we first obtain a sufficient condition for securtiy , using the lower bounds on the secret - key rate given above , c.f .",
    "( [ dw ] ) .",
    "then , we compute a necessary condition that follows from a specific eavesdropping attack .",
    "it is then shown that the two conditions coincide , so the resulting security condition is necessary and sufficient , under the mentioned distillation techniques .",
    "next , we apply this condition to two known examples , the bb84 and the six - state protocols .",
    "we finally discuss several ways of improving the derived condition , by changing the distillation techniques , including classical pre - processing by the parties or one - party s coherent quantum operations .",
    "in this section we will derive the announced sufficient condition for security using the lower bound on the secret - key rate of eq .",
    "( [ dw ] ) .",
    "just before the measurements , the honest parties share a bell diagonal state ( [ bdstate ] ) .",
    "this state is entangled if and only if @xmath59 , which follows from the fact that the positivity of the partial transposition is a necessary and sufficient condition for separability in @xmath60 systems @xcite . when alice and bob measure in their computational bases , they are left with classical data @xmath61_{ab}$](@xmath62 ) whereas eve still holds a quantum correlated system @xmath63 .",
    "the ccq correlations they share are described by the state ( up to normalization ) [ ccqcorr ] _ abe _ i , j  [ i , j  ] _",

    "this is because when discriminating @xmath9 copies of two states , there exists an adaptative sequence of individual measurements which achieves the optimal error probability ( [ e ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , what eve really needs is the ability to store her quantum states after listening to the ( public ) communication exchanged by alice and bob during the cad part of the protocol .",
    "as we have seen , the two cad protocols lead to the same security condition .",
    "this follows from the fact that eve is not assumed to measure her state before the cad takes place .",
    "then , she can effectively map one cad protocol into the other by means of the reversible operation @xmath107 .",
    "this is no longer true in the case of individual attacks .",
    "interestingly , in this scenario , the two two - way distillation methods do not give the same security condition .",
    "as mentioned , although the study of individual attacks gives a weaker security , it is relevant in the case of realistic eavesdroppers .",
    "moreover , we believe the present example has some interest as a kind of toy model illustrating the importance of the reconciliation part for security . recall that in the case of individual attacks , where eve can neither perform coherent operations nor have a quantum memory , the security condition using @xmath108 is the entanglement condition @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "however , when the honest parties apply @xmath110 plus one - way communication , the security condition is ( [ security ] ) .",
    "this holds true for two - qubit protocols , and remains open for the two - qudit protocols studied in the next sections @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that alice and bob apply @xmath110 and consider the following individual attack .",
    "eve knows that for all the instances passing the cad protocol , alice and bob s symbols are equal with very high probability .",
    "moreover , she knows that in all the position announced by alice , alice s symbol is the same .",
    "therefore , from her point of view , the problem reduces to the discrimination of @xmath9 copies of the two states @xmath111 .",
    "thus , she has to apply the measurement that optimally discriminates between these two states .",
    "as mentioned , the optimal two - state discrimination @xcite can be achieved by an adaptive individual measurement strategy .",
    "therefore , eve can apply this adaptive strategy to her states right after her individual interaction .",
    "her error probability is again given by ( [ e ] ) .",
    "that is , although the attack is individual , the corresponding security condition is the same as for collective attacks .",
    "this @xmath9-copy situation on eve s space does not happen when alice and bob apply @xmath108 .",
    "indeed , eve maps @xmath108 into @xmath110 by applying the correcting unitary operation @xmath112 after knowing the vector @xmath13 used in @xmath108 .",
    "this is the key point that allowed her to map one situation into the other above .",
    "this is however not possible in the case of individual attacks , where eve is assumed to measure before the reconciliation part takes place . under individual attacks ,",
    "the security condition for @xmath108 is equivalent to the entanglement condition for bell diagonal states , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two cad protocols , which have proven to be equivalent in terms of robustness against general quantum attacks , become inequivalent in the restricted case of individual attacks .",
    "the goal of the previous study has been to provide a general formalism for determining the security of qubit channels under a class of realistic qkd protocols .",
    "relevant _ prepare and measure _ schemes , such as the bb84 and six - state protocol , constitute a particular case of our analysis .",
    "indeed , the process of correlation distribution and channel tomography in these protocols is done by alice preparing states from and bob measuring in two ( bb84 ) or three ( six - state ) bases . in this section ,",
    "we apply the derived security condition to these protocols and compare the obtained results with previous security bounds .",
    "as explained in [ revbounds ] , a standard figure of merit in the security analysis of a given qkd protocol is given by the maximum error rate such that key distillation is still possible .",
    "for instance , in the case of one - way communication , the values of the critical error rates keep improving ( see @xcite for the latest result in this sense ) since the first general security proof by mayers @xcite . in the case of reconciliation",
    "using two - way communication , the best known results were obtained by chau in @xcite .",
    "it is then important to know whether these bound can be further improved . in what follows",
    ", it is shown that our necessary condition for security implies that chau s bounds can not be improved . in order to do that , then , one has to employ other reconciliation techniques , different from advantage distillation plus one - way standard techniques . some of these possibilities are discussed in the next sections .      in the bb84 protocol @xcite ,",
    "bits are encoded into two sets of mutually unbiased bases @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively , where @xmath115 .",
    "one can easily see that in the entanglement - based scheme , a family of attacks by eve producing a qber @xmath94 is given by the bell - diagonal states ( see also @xcite ) _ ab = ( 1 - 2q+x)[_1]+ ( q - x)[_2 ] + ( q - x)[_3 ] + x [ _ 4 ] , [ bb84state ] since the qber is q & = & 01 |_ab|01 + 10 |_ab|10 + & = & + - |_ab|+-+ -+ |_ab|-+[qber bb84]and @xmath116 .",
    "when alice and bob apply one - way communication distillation , the attack that minimizes ( [ dw ] ) is @xmath117 , and leads to the well - known value of @xmath118 , first obtained by shor and preskill in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding unitary interaction by eve is equal to the phase - covariant cloning machine , that optimally clones qubits in an equator ( in this case , in the @xmath119 plane ) .    when one considers the two - way distillation techniques studied in this work , condition ( [ security ] ) , or ( [ security2 ] ) , applies .",
    "then , one can see that the optimal attack , for fixed qber , consists of taking @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , eve s attack is , not surprisingly , strongly dependent on the type of reconciliation employed . in the case of two - way communication ,",
    "eve s optimal interaction can also be seen as a generalized phase - covariant cloning transformation , which is shown in the appendix i. using this attack , the derived necessary condition for security is violated when @xmath121 .",
    "this is precisely the same value obtained by chau in his general security proof of bb84 @xcite .",
    "so , the considered collective attack turns out to be tight , in terms of robustness .",

    "the full comparison is depicted in the fig .",
    "( [ two - way ] ) .",
    "note also that the state ( [ bb84state ] ) with @xmath120 , associated to the optimal attack , does not fit into our canonical form for bell diagonal states , since @xmath123 is not the minimal bell coefficient .",
    "this simply means that key distillation from this state using a simcap protocol is still possible .",
    "alice and bob only have to measure in a different basis , namely in the @xmath124 basis .",
    "that is , if alice and bob knew to share this state , or channel , and could prepare and measure states in the @xmath124 basis , not used in the considered version of bb84 , they would be able to establish a secure key .",
    "this channel is still useful for qkd using a prepare and measure scheme , although not using the considered version of bb84 . in our opinion , this illustrates why the present approach , that aims at identifying secrecy properties of channels without referring to a given protocol , is more general .",
    "if a third mutually unbiased basis , in the @xmath124 direction , is added to bb84 , one obtains the so - called six - state protocol .",
    "the information encoding is as follows : bit 0 is encoded on states @xmath125 , and @xmath126 in @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that an attack by eve producing a qber equal to @xmath94 is given by the bell diagonal state @xmath128 + \\frac{q}{2}[\\phi_{2 } ] + \\frac{q}{2}[\\phi_{3}]+\\frac{q}{2}[\\phi_{4}].\\ ] ] this attack actually corresponds to eve applying the universal cloning transformation .",
    "contrary to what happened for bb84 , this attack is optimal for both types of reconciliation protocols , using one- or two - way communication .",
    "applying the security condition ( [ security ] ) , the security bound gives a critical qber of @xmath129 .",
    "this value again coincides with the one obtained by chau in his general security proof of @xcite for the six - state protocol . the present attack , then , is again tight . in the case of indidual attacks ,",
    "the security bound @xcite is the entanglement limit @xmath130 .     and @xmath131 , respectively , for the bb84 and the six - state protocols .",

    "the previous section has applied the obtained security condition to two well - known qkd protocols . in the corresponding attack ,",
    "eve is forced to interact individually and in the same way with the sent qubits . as discussed , the de finetti results by renner imply that this does not pose any restriction on eve s attack .",
    "however , eve is also assumed to measure her states right after cad , while she could have delayed her measurement , for instance until the end of the entire reconciliation . in spite of this apparent limitation",
    ", the condition is shown to be tight , under the considered distillation techniques , for the two protocols .",
    "as it has been mentioned , the obtained bounds do not coincide with the entanglement limit .",
    "this raises the question whether prepare and measure schemes , in general , do attain this limit . or in other words , it suggests the existence of channels that , although can be used to distribute distillable entanglement , are useless for qkd using prepare and measure techniques .",
    "recall that a channel that allows to establish distillable entanglement is secure : this just follows from combining the de finetti argument with standard entanglement distillation .",

    ", however , this form of pre - processing does not give any improvement on the security bounds .",

    "remarkably , this protocol does not provide any improvement either . in our opinion , these results strengthen the conjectured bound secrecy of these weakly entangled states when using simcap protocols @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been observed that local classical pre - processing by the honest parties of their measurement outcomes can improve the security bounds of some qkd protocols @xcite .",
