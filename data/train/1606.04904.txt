    "topological magnon matter is the magnonic analog of topological fermionic matter . in contrast , magnons are charge - neutral bosonic excitations of ordered quantum magnets . thus , the transport properties of magnons are believed to be the new direction for dissipationless transports in insulating ferromagnets applicable to modern technology such as magnon spintronics and magnon thermal devices @xcite . in insulating collinear quantum magnets the dm interaction @xcite arising from spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite is the key ingredient that leads to thermal magnon hall effect @xcite and topological magnon bands @xcite .",
    "the dm interaction is present in magnetic systems that lack inversion symmetry between magnetic ions .",
    "the kagom lattice is built with this structure , because the midpoint of the bonds connecting two nearest - neighbour magnetic ions is not a center of inversion .",
    "therefore , a dm interaction is intrinsic to the kagom lattice .",
    "the thermal magnon hall effect induced by the dm interaction was first observed experimentally in a number of three - dimensional ( 3d ) ferromagnetic pyrochlores  lu@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , ho@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , and in@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the thermal magnon hall effect was realized in a kagom ferromagnet cu(1 - 3 , bdc ) @xcite followed by the first experimental realization of topological magnon bands @xcite in the same material . on the other hand , no topologcal magnon bands have been observed in pyrochlore ferromagnets , but recent studies have proposed weyl magnons in 3d pyrochlore ferromagnets @xcite .    in the same way a pyrochlore lattice can be visualized as an alternating kagom and triangular layers , the star lattice ( also known as the decorated honeycomb lattice ) can be visualized as an interpolating lattice between the honeycomb lattice and the kagom lattice .",
    "the number of sites per unit cell in star lattice is six , three times as in honeycomb and twice as in kagome .",
    "most importantly , the star lattice plays a prominent role in different branches of physics .",
    "the kitaev model on the star lattice has an exact solution as a chiral spin liquid @xcite .",
    "the star lattice also plays an important role in ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "in particular , quantum magnets @xcite and topological insulators @xcite on the star - lattice show distinctive remarkable features different from the kagome and honeycomb lattices .    motivated by these interesting features on the star lattice , the study of topological magnon bands on the star lattice is necessary and unavoidable . in this work ,",
    "we study the topological magnon bands and the thermal magnon hall response in insulating quantum ferromagnet on the star lattice .",
    "we show that lack of an inversion center allows a dm interaction between the midpoint of the triangular bonds .",
    "the dm interaction induces a fictitious magnetic flux in the unit cell and leads to nontrivial topological magnon bands .",
    "this directly leads to the existence of nonzero berry curvatures and chern numbers accompanied by topologically protected gapless edge modes .",
    "indeed , it is feasible to synthesize magnetic materials with the star structure and directly confirm the present theoretical results .",
    "( see appendix [ free ] ) in the presence of a magnetic field , where @xmath2 is the field - induced canting angle .",
    "bold arrows indicate the sign of the fictitious magnetic flux @xmath3 and the small arrows show the magnetic - field - induced spin canting in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane . @xmath6",
    "uniform flux .",
    "@xmath7 staggered flux . ]",
    "quantum magnets on the star lattice are known to possess magnetic long - range orders @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of the intrinsic dm perturbation have not been considered on the star lattice . here",
    ", we study a ferromagnetic model which is a magnetically ordered state on the star lattice . the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are exchange couplings within sites on the triangles `` @xmath11 '' and between triangles `` @xmath12 '' as shown in fig .",
    "the zeeman magnetic field is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 is the strength of the out - of - plane magnetic field .",
    "the last term @xmath16 represents all the perturbative interactions to the heisenberg exchange .",
    "the dm interaction is usually the dominant perturbative anisotropy .",
    "it is allowed on the star - lattice due to lack of inversion center between magnetic ions according to the moriya rule @xcite .",
    "the magneto - crystalline anisotropy is second order in perturbation which can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we will consider only the dm perturbation term .",
    "hence , @xmath17 there are two ferromagnetic ordered states on the star - lattice .",
    "the first one corresponds to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e. fully polarized ferromagnets on sublattice @xmath20 ( down pointing triangles indicated with blue sites ) and @xmath21 ( up pointing triangles indicated with red sites ) as shown in fig .",
    "the second one corresponds to @xmath18 and @xmath22 , i.e. , antiferromagnetic interaction between triangles and ferromagnetic interaction on each triangle . in the latter case",
    "the spins on sublattice @xmath20 are oriented in the opposite direction to those on sublattice @xmath21 , and they also ca nt along the magnetic field direction as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "as we will show in the subsequent sections , the latter case recovers the former case at the saturation field @xmath23 .",
    "at zero field the spins are aligned along the star plane chosen as the @xmath4-@xmath24 plane with the quantization axis chosen along the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the ground state is a collinear ferromagnet unaffected by the dm interaction .",
    "however , if the sublattices @xmath20 and @xmath25 are coupled antiferromagnetically , that is @xmath18 and @xmath22 , then a small magnetic field induces canting along the direction of the field and the ground state is no longer the collinear ferromagnets .",
    "the collinear ferromagnet is only recovered at the saturation field @xmath26 . in the large-@xmath27 limit",
    ", the spin operators can be approximated as classical vectors , written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a unit vector and @xmath30 denotes the down ( @xmath20 ) and up ( @xmath21 ) triangles , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath2 is the magnetic - field - induced canting angle .",
    "as the system is ordered ferromagnetically on each triangle , the dm interaction does not contribute to the classical energy given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is energy per site and @xmath35 is the number of sites per unit cell . minimizing the classical energy yields the canting angle @xmath36 .",
    "in the low temperature regime the magnetic excitations above the classical ground state are magnons and higher order magnon - magnon interactions are negligible .",
    "thus , the linearized holstein - primakoff ( hp ) spin - boson representation @xcite is valid . due to the magnetic - field - induced spin canting",
    ", we have to rotate the coordinate axes such that the @xmath5-axis coincides with the local direction of the classical polarization .",
    "this involves rotating the spins from laboratory frame to local frame by the spin oriented angles @xmath37 about the @xmath5-axis .",
    "this rotation is followed by another rotation about the @xmath24-axis with the canting angle @xmath2 , and the resulting transformation is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 applies to the spins residing on the sublattice @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) triangles respectively .",
    "it is easily checked that this rotation does not affect the collinear ferromagnetic ordering on each triangle , that is the @xmath40 term .",
    "usually , in collinear ferromagnets the perpendicular - to - field dm component does to contribute to the free magnon theory because the magnetic moments are polarized along the magnetic field direction @xcite .",
    "therefore , only the parallel - to - field dm component has a significant contribution to the free magnon dispersion @xcite . in the present model , however , the situation is different . due to antiferromagnetic coupling between triangles",
    "an applied magnetic field induces two spin components  one parallel to the field and the other perpendicular to the field . as we pointed out above",
    ", the dm interaction has a finite contribution to the free magnon model only when the magnetic moments are along its direction .",
    "therefore the parallel - to - field dm component ( @xmath41 ) and the perpendicular - to - field dm component ( @xmath42 ) will have a finite contribution to the free magnon theory due to spin canting .",
    "the former is rescaled as @xmath43 and the latter is rescaled as @xmath44 by the magnetic field . implementing the spin transformation the terms that contribute to the free magnon model",
    "are given by @xmath45,\\\\ & ~\\mathcal h_z= -h_{\\theta}\\sum_{i\\tau } s_{i\\tau}^{\\prime z},\\\\ & \\mathcal h_{\\text{pert},\\parallel}= d_{\\parallel,\\theta}\\sum_{\\la i , j\\ra\\tau}\\chi_{ij\\tau}^{\\prime z},~\\mathcal h_{\\text{pert},\\perp}=   \\pm d_{\\perp,\\theta}\\sum_{\\la i , j\\ra\\tau}\\chi_{ij\\tau}^{\\prime z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the @xmath5-component of the vector spin chirality @xmath48_z$ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath49 and @xmath50 dm components are oriented perpendicular to the bond due to the magnetic field . from these expressions",
    "it is evident that at zero magnetic field ( @xmath51 ) the spins are along the @xmath4-@xmath24 plane of the star lattice , therefore only the dm component parallel to the spin axis has a finite contribution to the free magnon model .",
    "the same is true at the saturation field ( @xmath52 ) when the spins are fully aligned along the @xmath5-direction . in appendix",

    "[ bandx1](b ) .",
    "for nonzero dm interaction ( lower panel ) the the magnon bands are separated by a finite energy gap proportional to the dm interaction in all the parameter regimes .",
    "notice that the collinear ferromagnet at @xmath61 has a quadratic dispersion ( goldstone mode ) at the @xmath62 point due spontaneous breaking of u(1 ) symmetry about the @xmath5-axis .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath63 the spins are canted due to antiferromagnetic interaction between the triangles .",
    "this leads to two spin components  perpendicular - to - field spin components and parallel - to - field spin components . in fig .",
    "[ bandz1 ] we have shown the magnon bands in the canted antiferromagnetic phase . indeed , we recover a linear goldstone mode at the @xmath62 point which signifies an antiferromagnetic spin order . in this case",
    "the model is no longer an analog of topological fermion insulator on the star lattice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the perpendicular - to - field spin components ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ bandz1 ] ) show gapless magnon bands even in the presence of dm interaction .",
    "a similar gapless magnon bands was reported in the kagom ferromagnet cu(1 - 3 , bdc ) @xcite when the spins are polarized along the kagom plane by an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , the parallel - to - field spin components ( bottom panel of fig . [ bandz1 ] ) show a finite gap separating the magnon bands due to the presence of dm interaction along the spin polarization .",
    "the topological aspects of gap dirac points can be studied by the defining the berry curvature and the chern number . in the present model we started from an antiferromagnetic coupled ferromagnets and then recovered a collinear ferromagnetic model .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian has an off - diagonal terms and the diagonalization requires the generalized bogoliubov transformation and the eigenfunctions define the berry curvatures and chern numbers ( see appendix [ berry ] ) .",
    "the chern number vanishes for all bands at zero dm interaction ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ bandx1 ] ) .",
    "we also find that the chern number vanishes for the magnon bands of perpendicular - to - field spin components ( top panel of fig .",

    "[ bandx1 ] and [ bandz1 ] ) which defines a topological magnon insulator .",
    "a nonzero chern number is associated with topological chiral gapless magnon edge modes which appear at the dm - induced gaps as shown in figs .",

    "inelastic neutron scattering experiment has measured the thermal hall conductivity in the kagom and pyrochlore ferromagnets @xcite .",
