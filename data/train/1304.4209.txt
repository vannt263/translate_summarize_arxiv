    "the aim of this work is to present a self - contained formal framework for the computation of the linearized field in situations which are different from those considered in standard textbooks .",
    "the typical approximation methods employed in the literature , based on the oscillating - quadrupole formula , involve several simplifying assumptions : far fields ( radiation region ) , no retardation in the source , symmetry of plane wave or spherical wave , tt gauge and absence of longitudinal field components .",
    "we relax all these assumptions .",
