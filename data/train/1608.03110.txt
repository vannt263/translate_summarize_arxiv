    "in astrophysical , space and laboratory plasmas , magnetic reconnection is a crucial mechanism of conversion of magnetic energy into plasma heating , bulk plasma motion and particle acceleration . in the past ,",
    "mainly the fluid aspects of this process were analyzed theoretically and numerically , as well as observationally and experimentally@xcite .",
    "collisionless magnetic reconnection causes , however , also non - maxwellian velocity space distribution functions ( vdf ) which are beyond any fluid description .",
    "non - maxwellian vdfs are formed , first of all , by local plasma processes .",
    "but they also contain information about the particles history of their past interactions with turbulence , providing remote signatures of the latter .",
    "hence , measured vdfs can be used for the investigation of magnetic reconnection , e.g. , in the earth magnetosphere .",
    "in addition to ion - vdfs , already well investigated in the past , recently also electron vdfs ( evdfs ) are becoming increasingly well observed , e.g. by the multi - spacecraft mission mms with its unprecedent spatial and temporal resolution to measure evdfs@xcite .",
    "self - consistent kinetic simulations using vlasov- or particle - in - cell ( pic ) codes have to be carried out since hybrid , test particle or fluid approaches can not reveal evdfs self - consistently .    in the past",
    ", the formation of evdfs was investigated mainly for reconnection through current sheets ( css ) embedded in antiparallel asymptotic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these works identified and explained several evdfs structures in and close to the diffusion region of reconnection , as long as the feedback reaction via waves and plasma turbulence plays a minor role@xcite .",
    "this implies that most of the evdf features in antiparallel magnetic field reconnection can be explained even in terms of test particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields .",
    "one typical evdf shape is , for example , triangular evdfs@xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be the direction of the initially antiparallel magnetic fields on both sides of the cs , @xmath4 the direction across the cs ( e.g. , of the density gradients in a harris - sheet equilibrium ) .",
    "then @xmath5 spans the reconnection plane and @xmath6 is the out - of - reconnection - plane ( current ) direction .",
    "triangular evdfs appear in the @xmath7 plane and have different striations or filamentary structures called `` beamlets '' .",
    "each `` beamlet '' corresponds to groups of particles that succeeded to bounce across the cs midplane ( @xmath8 , along @xmath3 ) the same number of times due to their meandering orbits@xcite .",
    "the `` beamlet '' with the maximum negative ( @xmath9 directed ) velocity @xmath10 corresponds to electrons with a larger number of reflections , which spent more time near the maximum reconnection electric field @xmath11 .",
    "their direction in the @xmath7 plane reflects the angle between the reconnecting magnetic field component @xmath12 and the out - of - plane component @xmath13 at the location where the electrons lose their gyrotropy .",
    "other structures in the vdfs are arcs and swirls .",
    "they are formed just outside the diffusion region , after the electrons are remagnetized .",
    "ring structures in the outflows jets form cup - like distributions in the 3d velocity space@xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of evdfs structures was also studied @xcite .",
    "flat - top distributions were found in the exhaust region@xcite , formed due to pitch angle diffusion after large anisotropies are generated for small asymptotic electron plasma-@xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the ratio of the electron thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure ) .",
    "the latter can cause strong parallel ( to the magnetic field ) electric fields and double layers , i.e. sites of additional particle acceleration .",
    "flat - top distributions are formed due to the chaotic scattering of electrons that cross the neutral plane where they temporarily lose their gyrotropy@xcite .",
    "the resulting velocity space pitch angle scattering reduces the anisotropy .",
    "flat - top distributions were also observed in the earth s magnetosphere@xcite .",
    "similar investigations were used to analyze the formation of vdfs by finite guide - field ( @xmath16 ) reconnection . note that finite guide - field strengths correspond to a deviation from a 180@xmath17 angle between the asymptotic fields in antiparallel reconnection .",
    "the resulting shear angles of the asymptotic fields are given by @xmath18 $ ] for the normalized guide - field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the asymptotic reconnection magnetic field strength .",
    "already for small guide fields @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) , the triangular - like structures in the evdfs disappear@xcite due to the modification of the quasi - adiabatic motion@xcite . since the form of the evdfs changes as @xmath23 , relatively large mass ratios are needed to investigate the evdfs of finite guide - field reconnection@xcite . also , the structures outside the diffusion region ( rings , arcs ) disappear because the extended outflow jets along the separatrices , typical for antiparallel reconnection , vanish already for very small guide fields @xcite . in weak guide - field reconnection ,",
    "electron trapping influences the formation of the evdfs causing anisotropic pitch angle distributions@xcite , as long as the adiabatic invariant @xmath24 is conserved .",
    "the density and magnetic field is asymmetrically distributed through the earth s magnetopause@xcite and finite guide - field reconnection applies .",
    "kinetic simulations of reconnection through such asymmetric current sheets revealed mainly crescent - shaped evdfs , which were explained as being due to a normal electrostatic field component generated by the pressure gradients through the cs@xcite .",
    "such crescent - shaped evdfs were mostly found at the stagnation points , where the ion and electron flows vanish at a location which just slightly deviates from its position in symmetric cs reconnection .",
    "crescent - shaped vdfs are , however , not a unique signature of asymmetric reconnection , they were obtained already in symmetric 1d cs fields for which they were verified by test particle calculations@xcite .",
    "these predictions are now being verified by mms spacecraft magnetopause observations @xcite . before discussing the evdfs formed by stronger guide - field reconnection ,",
    "let us clarify a terminology . in guide - field reconnection",
    ", the plasma density is different at different separatrices@xcite : around two separatrices the plasma density is enhanced , while it drops near the other two separatrices , forming density `` cavities ''",
    ". we will call these two different near - separatrix regions `` high - density '' and `` low - density separatrix '' , respectively .",
    "evdfs in cs with strong guide fields ( @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 ) , have been investigated , e.g. , by refs .  .",
    "they found parallel ( to the magnetic field ) electron beams , relating them to parallel bipolar electric fields formed in the cavities of the `` low - density separatrices '' .",
    "this is in contrast to the antiparallel case , where mainly the reconnection electric field near the x - line accelerates the electrons towards the exhaust region . especially in fully 3d configurations ,",
    "the streaming instabilities due to the electron beams in the cavities of the `` low - density separatrices '' generate strong electrostatic turbulence ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "similar turbulence is also generated in 2d configurations .",
    "but it is weaker and located away from the cs midplane , where a small projection of the parallel wavenumber onto the reconnection plane exists .",
    "the turbulence leads to thermalization of the beams via pitch - angle scattering forming flat - top distributions .",
    "the formation mechanisms of these vdfs in dependence on the guide - field strength is , however , still not clear , as well as their shapes in the exhaust region away from the x - line .",
    "the previous theoretical and numerical investigations were confirmed by the detection of particle beams in the earth s magnetosphere . in particular",
    ", measurements of ion beams in the magnetotail region known as plasma sheet boundary layer ( psbl .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) , located between the dense plasma sheet and the low density tail lobe .",
    "electron beams were detected in the psbl less often , perhaps , due to the higher instrumental resolution required@xcite .",
    "but recent measurements by the mms mission are providing more opportunities@xcite .",
    "the psbl region exhibits a strong broadband electrostatic noise from around the lower hybrid frequency @xmath27@xcite up to the electron plasma frequency consisting of mostly perpendicular ( to the magnetic field ) propagating waves , a feature which is associated also with flat - top evdfs@xcite .",
    "waves around the lower hybrid frequency are also often detected in magnetic reconnection events in the earth s magnetotail@xcite .",
    "electron beams evolve into electron holes via streaming instabilities , as shown by several 3d guide - field reconnection simulations ( e.g. , ref .  ) , but also in 2d@xcite and reduced 1d setups ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "electron holes have been observed in laboratory experiments@xcite , in the earth s magnetotail@xcite and in the magnetopause@xcite .",
    "note that electron holes and associated electrostatic turbulence do not only appear in guide - field reconnection ( as originally thought ) , but they were also found in antiparallel reconnection cases , as soon as the mass ratio and simulation box size were chosen large enough@xcite .",
    "based on the previous discussion , there is still the open question about the formation of evdfs in dependence on a strong guide - field strength , i.e. , for shear angles of the reconnecting fields much smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "for this part of the parameter space the consequences of instabilities , turbulence , particle trapping and scattering for the formation of the evdfs are not well known , yet .",
    "this is true , in particular , for the exhaust region of reconnection . to fill this gap in view of the coming mms observations we derive the potentially measurable non - maxwellian evdf signatures in dependence on the guide - field strength , taking into account the nonlinear interaction of the electrons with their self - generated turbulence .",

    "[ sec : beaminstabilities ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize , discuss and give an overview of the expected properties of the evdfs in dependence on the most probable macroscopic plasma and field parameters , mainly on the guide - field component strength ( the opening shear angle ) of the reconnecting magnetic fields .",
    "we carried out 2.5d ( i. e. , neglecting variations along the @xmath6 direction ) pic simulations with the acronym code@xcite .",
    "we initialize the simulations with a double harris current sheet equilibrium@xcite .",
    "each simulation run is identically initiated except we vary the external guide - field strength @xmath2 ( out of the @xmath5 reconnection plane , in the @xmath6 direction ) .",
    "we normalize the guide - field as @xmath29 , where @xmath20 is the asymptotic antiparallel magnetic field ( used also for the normalization of the magnetic @xmath30 fields ) .",
    "we simulate css for a number of guide fields between @xmath31 ( antiparallel ) and up to @xmath1 .",
    "the direction of the initial density variation across the cs is @xmath4 .",
    "we chose a cs with a halfwidth of @xmath32 , a mass ratio @xmath33 , a frequency ratio @xmath34 , a temperature ratio of @xmath35 and a background plasma density @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the electron / ion plasma density of the current - carrying population at the center of the cs , @xmath38 is the ion / electron skin depth , @xmath39 the ion / electron plasma frequency calculated with the density @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the electron plasma frequency in the asymptotic magnetic field @xmath20 .",
    "the background plasma has the same temperature and temperature ratio as the main current - carrying population .",
    "the previous parameters give an electron thermal speed of @xmath42 .",
    "the number of particles per cell ( ppc ) for the current - carrying population of electron and ions is @xmath43 at the center of the cs , while the background is represented by @xmath44 ppc .",
    "the simulation box size in the @xmath4 and @xmath3 directions is @xmath45 , and the boundary conditions are periodic in both directions .",
    "the simulation box size contains @xmath46 grid points , with the size of each cell @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electron debye length calculated with @xmath40 .",
    "the debye length is therefore over - resolved , to provide a sufficient resolution of the electron larmor radius in @xmath2 , @xmath49 , also in case of the strongest guide magnetic field @xmath1 . in our case , the ratio @xmath50 for @xmath51 , increasing linearly with the guide - field .",
    "this is to avoid numerical artifacts not related with stability conditions in the regime @xmath52@xcite .",
    "the timestep is chosen as @xmath53 .",
    "the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition for light wave propagation is fulfilled at the level @xmath54 .",
    "we initialize the system by a small tearing - like long - wavelength magnetic field perturbation , according to the vector potential @xmath55 @xmath56 with @xmath57 the perturbation strength .",
    "this is in order to reach quickly a developed reconnection stage with a single large magnetic island and an x - line centered at @xmath58 and @xmath59 for each of the two cs . from now on ,",
    "we show results for the left cs centered in @xmath60 .",
    "due to the initial perturbation and all the available magnetic flux in the simulation box , reconnection saturates after @xmath61 .",
    "as was found before@xcite , the guide fields delays the onset of reconnection and lowers the reconnection rates , mostly due to the hall effect@xcite of magnetized electrons interacting with the ions .",
    "the resulting spatial structure of the out - of - plane current density @xmath62 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_bg ] for three guide - field cases ( @xmath63 ) . for each case , the corresponding moment of time is chosen just after the saturation stage , when the opening angle of the exhaust region and reconnection rates are similar .",
    "note that a strong plasma turbulence develops in the exhaust region for @xmath64 .",
    "turbulence does not develop , however , at the boundaries in the @xmath65direction .",
    "this is because the initial current carrying particles accumulate there following the reconnection outflow / exhaust .",
    "thus , this turbulent region resembles the psbl of the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the plasma flow is more laminar in the smaller guide - field @xmath51 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_bg]b ) .",
    "turbulence does not develop at all for the smallest guide - field @xmath66 .",
    "the three values of @xmath63 represent well three different regimes of guide - field reconnection .",
    "note that in all these cases the electrons are strongly magnetized in the guide magnetic field , since the critical guide - field above which this happens is exactly ( see eq .  9 in ref .  )",
    "@xmath67^{1/4}=0.26.\\ ] ] the resulting evdfs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg ] for a characteristic point between the `` low - density separatrix '' and the exhaust region ( shown in fig .  [ fig : jz_bg ] ) .",
    "as the distributions in the plane @xmath68 and @xmath7 demonstrate , the evdfs deviate more from a maxwellian distribution for stronger guide fields .",
    "the reason for this deviation can be found by analyzing the turbulence developed inside the exhaust region .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) , a structure that resembles a double beam forms in the strong guide field case @xmath64 .",
    "the faster beam propagates in the direction opposite to the local magnetic field ( depicted as an red arrow ) , mainly in the @xmath69 direction , in agreement with previous works ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the mean drift speed of the faster beam can be estimated as @xmath70 ( outwards from the x - line ) , while the slower beam propagating in the opposite direction has a drift speed of @xmath71 ( inwards to the x - line ) .",
    "the dip in velocity space between the two beams indicates a source of free energy and a later evolution into an phase space hole .",
    "note that the two beam components are anisotropic with @xmath72 which provides another source of free energy for instabilities . specifically , the faster beam has @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while the slower beam has @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",
    "the decay channel is likely through the electron whistler instability , possible even in low - plasma-@xmath15 conditions ( present here ) , generating parallel propagating waves ( see sec .",
    "7.3.2 - 3 in ref .  ) .    in the moderately strong @xmath76 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](b ) ) , the distribution is anisotropic along the magnetic field direction , with @xmath77>@xmath78 .",
    "there is no clear double beam structure , only a barely visible double peaked maxwellian with components much closer each other than for the @xmath64 case ( compare specially the evdfs in the plane @xmath79 ) . for the smallest guide - field @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](a ) ) , the evdf is very close to an isotropic maxwellian , not developing a tail or plateau in the magnetic field direction .",
    "this is because the electrons spent less time being accelerated near the x - line by the reconnection electric field @xmath11 than for stronger guide - field cases .",
    "it is still possible to distinguish , however , a small `` bump '' oppositely directed to the local magnetic field , specially in the plane @xmath79 .",
    "the main consequence of these evdfs structures for both @xmath76 and @xmath66 cases is that both of them do not become unstable and do not generate any significant turbulence .",
    "electron beams , evolving later into structures similar to phase space holes , typically develop in the whole exhaust region between the separatrices for the case @xmath80 . this can be seen in phase space plots @xmath81 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_space ] for different guide fields , obtained as an @xmath82cut at @xmath83 ( in the exhaust region .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_bg ] ) . in all the cases ,",
    "the `` high - density separatrix '' is represented as the leftmost peak with @xmath84 .",
    "a density cavity forms around the `` low - density separatrix '' ( rightmost dip with @xmath85 ) .",
    "the differences in the separatrices densities are more expressed the larger the guide fields strength is .",
    "the reason is that strong guide fields enhance acceleration of the plasma flows .",
    "these plasma flows are then scattered along the separatrices ( see , e.g. , chp .",
    "8.4.1 of ref .  ) . for higher guide - field strengths ,",
    "bipolar electrostatic fields occur along the `` low - density separatrix '' , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "the maximum speed in @xmath10 of the electrons in the `` high - density separatrix '' is enhanced , while the width of their distribution in @xmath4 becomes narrower ( strong density gradient ) .        note that for the guide - field case @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_space](c ) ) , the distribution of the plasma population in the `` high - density separatrix '' constitute one arc of a crescent - like ( parabolic ) shape in the phase space cut @xmath86 ( at @xmath87 ) .",
    "the other end of the arc is next to the `` low - density separatrix '' ( at @xmath88 ) .",
    "note that these arcs are asymmetrical or tilted , suggesting a relation with some simulations of beam - driven lower hybrid instability@xcite , that explained those phase space structures as a result of the wave steepening associated with this instability ( see discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : beaminstabilities ] ) . in most of the exhaust region ,",
    "the mean drift speed of the electrons forming the upper arc or crescent - shaped population is @xmath89 , increasing towards the `` low - density separatrix '' .",
    "there is a second internal crescent - shaped distribution , with average drift speed of @xmath90 inside the exhaust region and boundaries between @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , throughout this region , the two crescent - shaped populations form the two beams ( drifting away mostly in the @xmath9direction ) similar to those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) ( taken at @xmath92 ) . the structures in between resemble phase space holes of size @xmath93 wide . for smaller guide fields ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) ,",
    "the dip between the two beams is reduced .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_space](b ) as a reduction in the distance between the two crescent - shaped populations close to the cs center . for @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_space](a ) ) , the two crescent - shaped populations completely merge in the exhaust region , becoming completely stable .",
    "the different crescent - shaped populations in the phase space cut @xmath86 correspond to electrons which were accelerated at different times and distances from the x - line , as predicted theoretically by ref .   and simulated by ref .  .",
    "electrons accelerated earlier and closer to the x - line obtain a higher speed in the @xmath96 direction , being pushed inwards to the exhaust region at an earlier time .",
    "those high energetic electrons are located in the boundaries of the crescent - shaped distribution in the phase space plane @xmath86 ( closer to the separatrices ) , where they are accelerated first . near the midplane",
    "they are decelerated instead , resulting in the concave shape of the crescent in the phase space cut @xmath86 .",
    "this process is due to the conservation of the magnetic moment @xmath97 : since the in - plane @xmath98 magnetic field is weaker ( stronger ) near the cs midplane ( separatrices ) , the electron @xmath10 drift speed has to be smaller ( larger ) there . on the other hand , because the out - of - plane magnetic field @xmath13 is stronger ( weaker ) near the cs midplane ( separatrices ) , this invariance also implies that the electron in - plane @xmath99 drift speeds are larger ( smaller ) there ( results not shown here ) . the smaller the guide - field , the more crescent shaped distributions are formed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_space](a ) ) .",
    "this is because electrons experience a greater acceleration near the x - line with maximum value of the reconnection electric field , but spend shorter time there compared to the case of stronger guide fields . as a result ,",
    "electrons are trapped in magnetic field lines closer to each other than in stronger guide fields .",
    "a similar magnetic trapping effect was discussed by ref .  .",
    "they showed that electrons trapped in the reconnecting magnetic fields lines can be advected with the plasma inflow to the x - line . since magnetic moment in guide - field reconnection",
    "is always conserved , the electrons move to a local minimum of the magnetic field .      in order to reconstruct the acceleration of the electron beams , we selected all the electrons ( @xmath100 ) belonging to the evdf shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) for the case @xmath80 at @xmath101 .",
    "then , we rerun the simulation outputting at a higher cadence the particle data , in order to trace the trajectories of the beam particles .",
    "we found that most of the electrons in the ( faster ) @xmath96 beam ( population i ) entered the vicinity of the x - line from a `` low - density separatrix '' ( fig .  [ fig : trajectories](a ) ) and become accelerated by the reconnection electric field .",
    "from there , they are expelled into the direction of the `` high - density separatrix '' .",
    "obviously , the electrons spend a longer time in the acceleration region the larger the guide - field is@xcite . for @xmath80 ,",
    "this is visualized as a strong drop in @xmath10 between @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : time_histories](a ) ) . the longer acceleration time is , however , compensated by the smaller reconnection electric field these electron see . as a result ,",
    "the overall acceleration and final drift speed in the beam are not significantly larger than for lower guide - field cases . on the other hand , after the electrons enter the exhaust region , their large @xmath96 speed is associated with an in - plane ( @xmath5 ) curved drift motion along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this drift is directed outwards from the x - line in the region between the `` high - density separatrix '' and the cs - midplane , and inwards to the x - line in the region between the `` low - density separatrix '' and the cs - midplane . as a result",
    ", the beam evdf of this population has a mean drift speed with negative @xmath103 and @xmath104 components for the location shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_bg](c ) ( see also discussion of fig .  [",
    "fig : vdfs_bg](c ) ) .    a typical electron trajectory with initially positive velocity @xmath105 ( population ii ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : trajectories](b ) ( for the evdf shown in the fig .  [ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) ) .",
    "their @xmath10 speed does not change significantly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_histories](b ) ) : they approach the x - line from the `` high - density separatrix '' , but do not encounter it as close as the ones entering via the `` low - density separatrix '' .",
    "most of them belonged originally to the background population .",
    "inside of the exhaust region , they have the opposite drift motion to those of the beam electrons with @xmath96 , i.e. : directed inwards to the x - line in the region between the `` high - density separatrix '' and the cs midplane , and outwards from the x - line in the region between the `` low - density separatrix '' and the cs - midplane . as a result , and different from the previous case , their beam evdf has a mean drift speed with positive @xmath106 and @xmath107 components for the location shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz_bg](c ) .",
    "the counterstreaming beam electrons cause an instability whose main source of free energy is the in - plane projection of the relative drift speed between them and the relative speed of each one with respect to the ions ( practically at @xmath108 compared with the electrons ) .",
    "the beam instability vanishes if the guide fields strength exceeds significantly @xmath109 . even though the beam in the negative @xmath96 direction is slightly faster in this limit ( due to the extra time spent in the acceleration region close to the x - line ) , its velocity projection in the @xmath5 plane is smaller due to the stronger magnetization . for small guide fields @xmath110 , on the other hand , there is no formation of electrons beams but rather a barely visible double peaked maxwellian , and therefore no significant source of free energy for instabilities ( see also discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_space ] ) . finally , there is a third electron population ( population iii ) illustrated by the trajectory shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories](c ) .",
    "these particles come from one of the `` high - density separatrices '' .",
    "their @xmath10 speed component is positive , being decelerated near the x - line , and then ejected into the `` low - density separatrix '' . inside the exhaust region ,",
    "the electrons of these population are scattered due to conservation of magnetic moment ( close to a minimum of magnetic field ) , changing their curved drift motion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_histories](c ) ) from the characteristic direction of population ii ( with @xmath105 ) to those of the population i ( with @xmath96 ) .",
    "it might seem that the counterstreaming beams of populations i and ii can be at the same physical location only due to the returning electrons through the periodic @xmath3 boundaries ( since they are ejected through different separatrices from the x - line ) .",
    "but the beams with @xmath96 have also a significant contribution from population iii with electrons changing the direction of their @xmath10 speed , allowing a direct interaction between counterstreaming beams .",
    "we can make a crude estimation by detecting the number of traced electrons changing direction from @xmath105 to @xmath96 in the exhaust region , keeping the negative drift speed at the end of the considered time period .",
    "they are 2083 , but many of them with low @xmath10 should be discarded since they do not contribute significantly to the beam . by establishing a bottom threshold of minimum change in @xmath111 , we get 1741 , and for @xmath112 we get 852 .",
    "the beam population with @xmath96 has 5794 traced electrons ( while the beam population with @xmath105 has 6801 ) .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the population iii to the counterstreaming beam @xmath96 can be estimated to be between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the rest should come from the returning electrons through the periodic boundaries .",
    "therefore , a significant proportion of the instability and turbulence reported for the @xmath80 case should always be seen , independent of any boundary condition .          for moderately strong guide fields ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "fast beams are accelerated causing turbulence due to streaming instabilities . as a result ,",
    "structures resembling phase space holes are formed while pitch - angle scattering isotropize the originally anisotropic beam evdfs .",
    "the beam evdfs ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) ) are , therefore , transient in their interaction with turbulence .",
    "plateaus formed in the evdfs fill the voids in the velocity - space between the beams , making them stable ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : probe_info](a ) . the magnetic fluctuation strength is lower than the electric one , as observed in the psbl of the earth s magnetosphere under low plasma-@xmath14 conditions@xcite .",
    "note that the electrostatic fluctuations reported here are seem different from the parallel ( and bipolar ) turbulence usually seen in the `` low - density separatrices '' ( cavities ) of guide - field reconnection due to streaming instabilities .",
    "the main reason is that they have mostly low frequencies ( see discussion later ) and are not constrained to the separatrix region , but fill most of the exhaust region .",
    "the instabilities generating electrostatic turbulence in the `` low - density separatrices '' of reconnection were found to be mostly of streaming - type , generating mostly high frequency waves at electron scales . in particular ,",
    "two - streaming and buneman instabilities seem to be very ubiquitous , as shown by 2d pic simulations of magnetic reconnection with@xcite and without guide - field@xcite .",
    "shear flow instabilities like kelvin - helmholtz instability have also been reported@xcite(see more details in chp .",
    "8.4.1 of ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "streaming instabilities due to electron beams have been observed in the psbl of the earth s magnetosphere , generating high frequency langmuir - like waves ( see , e.g. , and references therein ) , as well as in the magnetopause@xcite .",
    "we found evidence that the instability operating in our case might be due to a combination of buneman ( electron beams with ions ) and two - streaming ( between electron beams ) instability with parallel propagation ( see a general overview of these instabilities in ref .   and",
    "3.2 and 8.5 of ref .  )",
    "in addition to a ( beam - driven ) lower - hybrid instability with nearly perpendicular propagation@xcite , with the latter being probably the dominant one . note that most of the relative drift speed between the beams is in the out - of - plane @xmath6 direction because of the strong magnetization for the guide field @xmath80 .",
    "however , there is a small in - plane projection of that relative drift that allow the existence of parallel propagating waves and the mechanism behind all these instabilities in the reduced 2.5d geometry of our simulations .",
    "the main result of these instabilities is the generation of lower hybrid waves and turbulence .",
    "an alternative way of interpreting this is considering the in - plane drift speed of the electron beams as a transverse current perpendicular to the local magnetic field ( mostly along @xmath6 ) , generating a cross - streaming instability known as modified two - streaming instability mtsi ( see e.g. , refs .   and chp .  4.4 in ref .  ) .",
    "mtsi was proposed to be active in the diffusion region of magnetic reconnection@xcite .",
    "note that this can only be an effect of our simulation geometry . in any case",
    ", the features of this instability are very similar to those of the lower - hybrid instability , leading to the same kind of unstable waves and turbulence . in addition",
    ", other instabilities might also be active , like electron whistler , due to the initial anisotropy of the beams ( see sec .",
    "7.3.2 - 3 in ref .  ) .",
    "we found four signatures of these streaming instabilities generating lower hybrid turbulence .",
    "first : the characteristic frequency of the electric field fluctuations is broadband with ( low ) frequencies up to the lower hybrid frequency @xmath118 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_info](a ) ) . for our parameters",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath119 .",
    "the most likely source of free energy for this wave activity is the lower - hybrid instability due to parallel propagating electron beams ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) ) , possibly interacting also with the ion distribution ( practically at @xmath120 ) , agreeing in order of magnitude with theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "note that monochromatic wave activity such as typically expected only from two - streaming / buneman instabilities generates electron trapping in coherent structures , with high frequency waves close to electron scales , not observed in our case . on the other hand ,",
    "the obliquely propagating lower hybrid waves are incoherent , broadband , and able to scatter particles@xcite , which agree more with our simulations results .",
    "furthermore , the typical decay period of the electron beams is within the order of magnitude of the growth rate of these instabilities ( for similar parameters , ref .",
    "reported flattening of evdfs beams in @xmath121 in their pic simulations , which is about @xmath122 in our case ) .",
    "note that 3d pic simulations of guide - field reconnection have shown that waves in the lower hybrid range of frequencies can be generated by either the lower hybrid drift instability ( lhdi ) due to density gradients@xcite , or beam - driven lower hybrid instability caused by the nonlinear decay of two - streaming / buneman instabilities in the cavities of the `` low - density separatrix''@xcite .",
    "2d simulations of magnetic reconnection without guide field have also found wave activity close to the lower hybrid frequency generated by the buneman instability@xcite , in scenarios where the relative streaming speed is relatively slow .",
    "this interplay between the nonlinear phase of the structures generated by the buneman instability and the subsequent generation of lower hybrid waves have also been reported in simulations specifically designed to study this instabilities@xcite .",
    "the second evidence for this streaming instability is its threshold or stabilization condition . for the following estimations",
    ", we should estimate first the typical relative drift speed between the electron beams .",
    "the field aligned speed between the two counterstreaming beams in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdfs_bg](c ) : @xmath123 , while the local magnetic field direction is given by the unitary vector @xmath124 .",
    "then , the magnitude of the projection of the field aligned speed onto the plane @xmath5 can be obtained by multiplying @xmath125 by the factor @xmath126 , resulting in @xmath127 ( note that @xmath128 ) .",
    "the relative drift speed with respect to the practically unmagnetized ions is about half of these values .",
    "this has to be compared with the parallel beam temperature , given by @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding projection is @xmath130 .",
    "both temperatures ( field aligned or in - plane projection ) are much smaller than the relative electron beam drift speed , satisfying the criterion to trigger the beam - driven lower hybrid instability .",
    "the lower hybrid instability is stabilized for high plasma-@xmath14 conditions , because it requires negligible magnetic shear@xcite .",
    "the instability is allowed only for drift speeds @xmath131 such as @xmath132 . for an in - plane drift speed of @xmath133 ,",
    "this ratio is @xmath134 , which is therefore well satisfied . for smaller guide fields , even if the same kind of electron beams would appear ( which is not the case ) , they would be stable since the higher plasma-@xmath14 would violate the previous condition . quasilinear@xcite and kinetic pic simulations@xcite have shown that the lower hybrid instability can be active in a wide range of parameters in which other parallel propagating instabilities ( such as buneman ) are stable",
    ". this might be the case when the evdfs have plateau - like structures between the beams , as it is in our case at some locations .",
    "the third evidence is that wave activity in the lower - hybrid frequency range causes parallel electron heating and perpendicular ion heating ( see , e.g. refs .  , and references therein )",
    "this is because the lower hybrid waves have long parallel wavelengths ( resonating with electrons ) and short perpendicular wavelengths ( resonating with ions ) .",
    "indeed , lower hybrid waves are known to propagate nearly perpendicularly with @xmath135 ( see some additional features and approximations of the dispersion relation of these waves in ref .  ) .",
    "both features are recovered in our simulations results ( the ion distributions are not shown here ) .",
    "this characteristic heating due to lower hybrid waves was also observed in the psbl of the earth s magnetosphere@xcite , although due to kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) .",
    "the fourth evidence for the streaming instability is its phase speed and wave number .",
    "for that , fig .",
    "[ fig : probe_info](b ) shows the wavenumbers @xmath136 of the electric field @xmath117 fluctuations .",
    "the wavenumbers with higher spectral power show a broadband distribution ( as expected from lower hybrid activity@xcite ) in the range @xmath137 .",
    "the low end range can be misleading because the homogeneity assumption of linear theory breaks down at such large spatial scales ( closer to the cs halfwidth ) .",
    "this wavenumber ( @xmath136 ) contains both parallel and perpendicular fluctuations , but we can take it as @xmath138 for an estimations of the order of magnitude . therefore , the range of wave phase speeds is on the order of @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "this implies that at least the waves within the lower phase speed range can resonate with the ( in - plane projected ) electron beams .",
    "note that the possibly also active anisotropy - driven electron - whistler instability perhaps also contributes to the turbulence as one can see at smaller scales than the size of the phase space structures ( in the upper range of unstable @xmath141 ) .",
    "note that these electrostatic structures seem different from the known electron holes located in the `` low - density separatrix '' region of guide - field reconnection .",
    "the latter are as large as eight times the electron skin depth @xmath142 , decreasing in units of @xmath143 for higher mass ratios , and mostly independent on the guide - field and mass ratio@xcite ( see also chp .",
    "8.4.1 of ref .  ) .",
    "the size of the electrostatic structures in the exhaust region of reconnection discussed here are , however , inversely proportional to the guide - field .",
    "their sizes coincide with the electron holes previously reported only in the order of magnitude for the case @xmath80 .",
    "note that several other effects can hinder the applicability of linear theory to our case .",
    "this requires magnetized electrons with @xmath144 , relatively well satisfied in our case .",
    "but the approximation of homogeneous plasma , the neglect of electromagnetic effects , wave - wave coupling and the relative drift speed are either not well satisfied or vary in a wide parameter range .",
    "that is why all the previous estimations should be taken with caution .",
    "our goal was to find characteristic signatures in the electron velocity space distributions ( evdfs ) formed by non - antiparallel ( component- , finite guide - field- ) magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasmas . using 2.5-dimensional pic code simulations",
    ", we self - consistently obtained the evdfs near the separatrices as well as in the exhaust ( outflow ) region of reconnection in dependence on the guide - field strength . to obtain the observable evdfs",
    ", we took into account the feedback of the non - linear interaction of the self - generated turbulence caused by the non - maxwellian evdfs with the electrons .",
    "guide - field reconnection generates , in addition to the electron beams along the separatrices , also unstable beams in the reconnection exhaust ( outflow ) region .",
    "these beams propagate mostly aligned with the local magnetic field , their evdfs are gyrotropic and anisotropic .",
    "they accumulate free energy not only due to their relative streaming , but also by their anisotropy with a higher temperature in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "the different kinds of free energy are released via plasma instabilities , causing turbulence mainly in the lower - hybrid frequency range .",
    "we found that the beam electrons are not accelerated by parallel electric fields in the cavities of the `` low - density separatrix '' regions , but rather by the reconnection electric field . after being accelerated near the x - line",
    ", these electrons are ejected into the beams , depending on their incidence angle and speed , either to the `` high- '' or `` low - density separatrix '' regions .",
    "a large number of the beam electrons become trapped in the exhaust region .",
    "the resulting counter - streaming electron beams cause streaming instabilities .    for strong guide fields @xmath145 , the resulting streaming instability is evidenced by a strong electrostatic broadband turbulence near the lower hybrid frequency , which arises as soon as the relative drift speed between the beams exceeds the instability threshold .",
    "the phase speeds and wavenumbers of the unstable waves match the theoretical predictions of lower - hybrid streaming instabilities . as a result of their interaction with the self - generated turbulence ,",
    "the beam electrons are pitch - angle scattered .",
    "hence , with time the evdfs become increasingly isotropic .",
    "furthermore , the gaps in the velocity space between the counterstreaming beams become filled and plateaus arise in the evdfs in association with phase space holes .    in case of small guide - fields ( @xmath146 ) , reconnection does not generate those beams .",
    "the reason is that the electron acceleration near the x - line is less efficient in this limit because the acceleration time near the x - line is too short .",
    "instead , a larger part of the released energy by reconnection enhances the outflow plasma bulk speed .    in the limit of very strong guide fields ( @xmath147 ) , on the other hand , the relative beam drift velocity is largest while the in - plane projection of the gained speed is smaller than in the strong guide - field regime @xmath145 . in this case , the guide - magnetic field component @xmath148 is much larger than the in - plane component @xmath98 .",
    "note that in a 2.5d setup , the beam energy can not be dissipated by waves propagating in the out - of - plane direction . in three - dimensions ,",
    "the beam energy will probably be dissipated via out - of - plane directed turbulent electromagnetic fields .",
    "note that the formation of counter - streaming electron beams and the resulting turbulence in the reconnection exhaust is not just an artifact of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , a significant contribution ( estimated to be @xmath149 ) comes from the reflection of streaming beam electrons in the exhaust / outflow region of reconnection , independent of the boundaries which these electrons do not reach .",
    "we confirmed this by running simulations with larger boxes in the exhaust / outflow direction .",
    "they revealed the same or even higher turbulence levels ( results not shown here ) .",
    "a system with periodic boundary conditions is also relevant for the understanding of acceleration at multiple x - points between the magnetic islands , as it is known to happen in strong guide - fields@xcite , in cascading reconnection @xcite and in plasmoid - unstable current sheets @xcite .",
    "note that we investigated the evdfs typical for non - antiparallel ( magnetic field ) reconnection through symmetric ( density ) current sheets .",
    "our predictions , therefore , neglect the effects arising in asymmetric current sheets like at the earth s magnetopause .",
    "previous simulations of asymmetric reconnection@xcite have shown , however , that the density asymmetry affects the evdfs mainly by additional particle acceleration in the electrostatic field generated by the pressure gradients across the current sheet@xcite . concerning the strength of the guide - fields , mms observations revealed already finite guide - field reconnection situations with @xmath150@xcite , @xmath94 @xcite and @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "close to the reconnection x - line , those authors already found anisotropic evdfs preferentially heated in the magnetic field direction .",
    "this qualitatively agrees well with our predictions ( detailed evdfs not shown here ) .",
    "the next task of the mms mission will be the investigation of magnetic reconnection the earth s magnetotail . there",

    "<S> non - maxwellian electron velocity space distribution functions ( evdf ) are useful signatures of plasma conditions and non - local consequences of collisionless magnetic reconnection . in the past </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of the evdfs was investigated mainly for antiparallel or weak - guide - field reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of evdfs is , however , not well known yet for oblique ( or component- ) reconnection in dependence on a finite guide magnetic field component perpendicular to the reconnection plane . in view of the multi - spacecraft mission mms , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the non - maxwellian features of evdfs formed by collisionless magnetic reconnection starting from very weak ( @xmath0 ) up to very strong ( @xmath1 ) guide - field strengths @xmath2 , taking into account the feedback of the self - generated turbulence . for this sake , </S>",
    "<S> we carry out 2.5d fully - kinetic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations using the acronym code . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained anisotropic evdfs and the distribution of electron beams propagating along the separatrices as well as in the exhaust region of reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> the beam evdfs are anisotropic with a higher temperature in the direction perpendicular rather than parallel to the local magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the beams propagate in the direction opposite to the background plasma electron flows , providing a source of free energy for instabilities . in dependence on the guide - field strength </S>",
    "<S> , the relative drift speed of the electrons can exceed the threshold of streaming instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the non - linear consequences of the resulting self - generated plasma turbulence for the formation and the final shaping of the evdfs . </S>",
    "<S> we found how , both near the separatrices and in the exhaust region of reconnection , the turbulence as well as its non - linear feedback to the evdfs depend on the guide - field strength . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the self - generated plasma turbulence leads well beyond the limits of the quasi - linear approximation , phase space holes are created and strong isotropizing pitch - angle scattering takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained evdfs can be used for diagnosing collisionless reconnection by means of multi - spacecraft observations carried out by the mms mission . </S>",
    "<S> + _ the following article has been submitted to physics of plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> after it is published , it will be found at http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/pop_ </S>"
