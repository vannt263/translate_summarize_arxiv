    "the `` metallic - lined '' or am stars are a - type stars which have strong absorption lines of some metals such as zn , sr , zr and ba and weaker lines of other metals such as ca and/or sc relative to their spectral type as determined by the strength of the hydrogen lines @xcite .",
    "the strong metallic lines are more typical of an f star rather than an a star .",
    "the work of @xcite established radiative diffusion in a strong magnetic field as the likely cause of the chemical peculiarities in ap stars .",
    "when the magnetic field is absent , diffusion leads to the am / fm stars @xcite .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields in am stars has been investigated , but with negative results , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a peculiarity of am stars is that their projected rotational velocities are generally much smaller than normal a stars and they are nearly always members of close binary systems",
    ". rotational braking by tidal friction in a binary system is regarded as a possible explanation for the low rotational velocities in am stars .",
    "slow rotation further assists the segregation of elements by diffusion .",
    "the abundance anomalies predicted by the diffusion hypothesis are usually much larger than observed .",
    "@xcite developed detailed models of the structure and evolution of am / fm stars using opal opacities , taking into account atomic diffusion and the effect of radiative acceleration .",
    "these models develop a convective zone due to ionization of iron - group elements at a temperature of approximately 200,000  k. in addition to this convective zone , these stars also have a thin superficial convective zone in which h and hei are partially ionized . by assuming sufficient overshoot due to turbulence , these separate convective zones become one large convective zone .",
    "the resulting mixing dilutes the large abundance anomalies predicted by previous model , leading to abundances which closely resemble those observed in am / fm stars .",
    "a detailed abundance analysis of eight am stars belonging to the praesepe cluster @xcite show good agreement with the predictions of @xcite for almost all the common elements except for na and possibly s. the models of @xcite assume a certain ad - hoc parametrization of turbulent transport coefficients which are adjusted to reproduce observations .",
    "other parameterizations of turbulence have been proposed for other types of stars . @xcite",
    "have investigated to what extent these are consistent with the anomalies observed on am / fm stars .",
    "they find that the precision of current abundances is insufficient to distinguish between models .",
    "more recently , @xcite have studied the abundance anomalies of the mild am star sirius a. they find that except for b , n and na , there is good agreement with the predicted anomalies but turbulent mixing or mass loss is required .",
    "it is not clear whether it is turbulence or mass loss which competes with diffusion to lower the abundance anomalies .",
    "for example , @xcite find that diffusion in the presence of weak mass loss can explain the observed abundance anomalies of pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "this is in contrast to turbulence models which do not allow for abundance anomalies to develop on the pre - main - sequence .",
    "most of the pulsational driving in @xmath0  scuti stars is caused by the @xmath1  mechanism operating in the heii ionization zone .",
    "diffusion tends to drain he from this zone and therefore pulsational driving may be expected to be weaker or absent in am / fm stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , for many years it was thought that classical am / fm stars did not pulsate , though claims were made for some stars @xcite .",
    "recently , intensive ground - based observations by super - wasp @xcite , and also from the _ kepler _ mission @xcite have shown that many am / fm stars do pulsate .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that about 200 am / fm stars out of a total of 1600 ( 12.5 percent ) show @xmath0  sct pulsations , but with generally lower amplitudes .",
    "they found that the pulsating am / fm stars are confined between the red and blue radial fundamental edges , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "while there are many @xmath0  sct stars hotter than the fundamental blue edge , this does not seem to be the case for pulsating am / fm stars .",
    "the significance of this result remains to be evaluated .",
    "the effect of draining of he from the heii ionization zone is to reduce the width of the instability strip , the blue edge moving towards the red edge , eventually leading to the disappearance of the instability strip when he is sufficiently depleted @xcite .",
    "@xcite has discussed the effect of diffusion on pulsations in am / fm stars using the models by @xcite .",
    "one significant difference with earlier models is that a substantial amount of he remains in the heii ionization zone .",
    "the blue edge of the instability strip for am / fm stars is sensitive to the magnitude of the abundance variations and is thus indicative of the depth of mixing by turbulence .",
    "@xcite predict that pulsating am / fm stars should lie in a confined region of the hr diagram close to the red edge of the @xmath0  sct instability strip .",
    "however , @xcite show that there is no relationship between the predicted am / fm instability strip and the actual location of these stars in the hr diagram .",
    "a particularly interesting result of the pulsation analysis of @xcite is the prediction of long - period g modes in a - type stars .",
    "as the star evolves , the driving regions shift deeper into the star and the g modes become gradually more and more excited .",
    "whereas p modes are stabilized through diffusion , g modes tend to be excited as a result of that process .",
    "it appears that diffusion may act to enhance driving of long - period g modes due to a significant increase in opacity due to iron - group elements .",
    "this may have a bearing on the fact that nearly all a - type stars observed by _",
    "kepler _ have unexplained low - frequencies @xcite .",
    "when dealing with objects with non - standard chemical composition , such as am stars , it is crucial that the opacities are correctly calculated . this question has been investigated by several authors in recent years .",
    "these studies show that a non - standard chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere alters the flux distribution of the star or modifies the profiles of the balmer lines ( @xcite , @xcite ) . therefore a determination of t@xmath2 and @xmath3 based on a comparison between observed and computed balmer - line profiles will not be correct unless one takes into account the metallicity of the star .",
    "thus , even estimates based on standard analysis of the spectra may be in error when applied to am / fm stars .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the determination of effective temperature and surface gravity of the am star hd27411 ( hr  1353 , a3 m ) using spectra in the eso archives .",
    "the purpose is to determine whether the stellar parameters of this star agree with those obtained from strmgren photometry and hence to test the reliability of the effective temperature calibration applied to am / fm stars .",
    "the star was used by @xcite as a comparison in their study on the calcium stratification in ap stars .",
    "hd27411 is not known to pulsate . however , as we know from _ kepler _ observations , pulsations in a and f stars with amplitudes too low to be detected from the ground are common .",
    "atmospheric models obtained with atlas9 @xcite use precomputed line opacities in the form of opacity distribution functions ( odfs ) .",
    "these are tabulated for multiples of the solar metallicity and for various microturbulent velocities .",
    "this approach allows very fast computation of model atmospheres , but with very little flexibility in choice of chemical profile and microturbulent velocity .",
    "while this is satisfactory for most applications , it fails for chemically peculiar stars where a non - standard chemical composition profile is required .",
    "this can be done with atlas12 @xcite , which is essentially identical to atlas9 , but uses the opacity sampling ( os ) method to evaluate line opacities . in this study",
    "we compare the abundances of hd27411 obtained with both codes to determine if the use of atlas12 is essential .",
    "the result that am stars are not confined to particular region of the @xmath0  sct instability strip depends , to a large extent , on effective temperatures and luminosities estimated from strmgren photometry @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether the calibration , derived from normal af stars , can be applied to am / fm stars . in this paper",
    "we use synthetic strmgren photometry applied to models of am / fm stars to investigate the reliability of fundamental parameters estimated from the photometry .",
    "finally , we discuss the relative numbers of pulsating and non - pulsating am stars and compare these to the relative numbers of @xmath0  scuti and constant stars in the instability strip . from this comparison",
    ", one can deduce the effectiveness of pulsational driving in the heii ionization zone and compare the he abundance to that expected from diffusion calculations .",

    "it is evident that there is good agreement in the abundances derived with the two different codes .",
    "there are some very small differences for na , v , zr and nd , but these are only 0.1  dex or less",
    ". thus we may use the faster atlas9 code with confidence . in fig .",
    "[ pattern ] we show the abundances relative to solar standard abundances @xcite .",
    "the chemical pattern displayed here is typical of that observed in am stars , i.e. an underabundance of c , n , o , ca and sc and a general increasing overabundance for heavy elements .",
    "the atmospheric abundance of li is interesting in the context of diffusion . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that , in general , the li abundance in am stars is close to the cosmic value ( @xmath5  dex ) , although some am / fm stars appear to have an underabundance of li .",
    "normal a - type stars in the range @xmath6  k appear to have a higher li abundance , i.e. @xmath7  dex , @xcite .",
    "to determine the li abundance , we used the lii @xmath86707  line , taking into account the hyperfine structure @xcite .",
    "the abundance that gives the best fit is @xmath9=@xmath108.42@xmath110.10 , which is closer to the abundance in normal a stars and agrees with the average li abundance of three cluster am / fm stars observed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite predict abundances as a function of stellar age and effective temperature using their models of diffusion .",
    "fig .  14 of their paper allows us to estimate the predicted abundances for a star with a given t@xmath2 up to a maximum age of @xmath12670  myrs .",
    "we find that age of hd27411 to be about @xmath13  myr , which is considerably older than the maximum age of models in @xcite , but we will assume that models of 670  myr still give a fair approximation of the abundances . for t@xmath2=7400  k , which is our best estimate for hd27411 ,",
    "the models by @xcite predicts underabundances ranging from -0.3  dex to -0.1  dex for c , n , o , na , mg , k , and ca . for si and s the abundances are normal , while overabundances of about 0.10.8  dex are found for for li , al , ti , cr , mn , fe , and ni .",
    "inspection of their figure reveals that for na , mg , al , si , s , ca , ti , cr , mn , and fe , the abundance anomaly is approximately constant with age and depends only on the turbulence .",
    "the abundances of li , c , n , and o vary with age .",
    "[ pattern ] shows the abundances of the elements at 670  myr predicted by @xcite compared with our abundances .",
    "there is indeed good agreement for li , c , n , o , mg , k , ca , ti , mn , fe , and ni , but abundances of na , al , si , s , and cr are somewhat discrepant .",
    "similar discrepancies for na and s were found by @xcite for the am star hd73730 . from the nlte analysis of the s abundance by @xcite",
    ", @xcite concluded that nlte effects should be taken into account to determine whether this resolves the discrepancy with diffusion predictions .",
    "following this idea , we performed a nlte analysis on na , al , si , s , and cr , to derive their abundances . we used the same technique of matching predicted and observed line profiles , but in this case the nlte line profiles were computed with version 43 of synspec @xcite .",
    "this code reads the same input model atmosphere previously computed using atlas12 and solves the radiative transfer equation , wavelength by wavelength in a specified spectral range .",
    "synspec also reads the same kurucz list of lines that we used for determining metal abundances .",
    "synspec allows one to compute the line profiles by using an approximate nlte treatment , even for lte models .",
    "this is done by means of second - order escape probability theory ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in table  [ abund ] .",
    "all the nlte abundances are lower than the lte abundances by factors ranging from 0.23  dex ( s ) to 0.39  dex ( al ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ pattern ] , the nlte calculations bring the observations closer to the diffusion predictions by @xcite . in fact , there is no longer any discrepancy in abundances within the observational errors .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of line blanketing on the strmgren colour indices , we used the method of synthetic photometry . for this purpose",
    "we computed the spectrum of a star at different effective temperatures with abundances shown in table[abund ] .",
    "we used the abundances given by the atlas12 models modified by nlte where necessary .",
    "the spectra were calculated using spectrum , version 2.76e @xcite .",
    "synthetic spectra with normal and peculiar abundances were calculated for @xmath14  k and @xmath15 . in all cases",

    "f main sequence and giants , this translates into an error of about 0.12 in @xmath41 when using the calibration of @xcite . for hd27411 , for example , we derive @xmath42 from spectroscopy , whereas the value derived from the parallax is @xmath43 ( table2 ) , although the two values only differ by two standard deviations , this is enough to cause a difference of 0.36 in @xmath41 .",
    "although spectroscopic determinations of luminosities may lead to quite large errors in the luminosity , they should at least not be biased . *    by far the most serious problem confronting the diffusion model is that there seems to be no appreciable settling of he in the heii ionization zone , as predicted by the models .",
    "this is demonstrated by the fact that pulsating am / fm stars occur throughout the @xmath0  scuti instability strip , though they tend to be cooler than normal @xmath0  sct stars .",
    "in fact , the relative proportions of pulsating am stars to non - pulsating am stars is no different from the proportion of @xmath0  sct stars to constant stars in the @xmath0  sct instability strip .",
    "there is clearly a need to revise current ideas of diffusion to explain the am phenomenon .",
