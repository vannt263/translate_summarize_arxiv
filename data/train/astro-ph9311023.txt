    "this paper attempts to combine several disparate streams of work in the study of cosmological perturbations . since the early work of lifschitz@xcite , sachs and wolfe@xcite and others ,",
    "the evolution of large scale matter perturbations to a spatially homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe has been well - studied .",
    "more recently , this work has been refined to apply to a more complicated universe containing both radiation ( with equation of state @xmath4 ) and non - relativistic matter ( @xmath5 ) constituents , using a gauge - invariant approach@xcite .",
    "in addition , large @xmath2-body simulations have been used to examine the fully nonlinear problem of gravitational evolution on scales much smaller than the hubble radius , where the newtonian limit of general relativity is sufficient@xcite . on the other hand , certain aspects of the full non - linear evolution equations",
    "do remain amenable to a more analytic approach .",
    "an area of work that has received considerable attention in the past decade is the examination of higher - order corrections to the linear newtonian equations of motion for the matter in the universe within the framework of perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "these higher - order corrections are intimately related to the evolution of the multi - point correlations of the mass ( and therefore , of the galaxies ) , such as the three - point function , @xmath6 , the skewness , or , in fourier - space , the bispectrum , @xmath7 .",
    "as increasingly large galaxy surveys become available , observational information on these moments of the galaxy distribution has been extended to scales sufficiently large that this perturbative approach is expected to be reliable . in the case of an initially gaussian density field for which all reduced higher - order correlations",
    "vanish , this `` quasi - nonlinear '' gravitational evolution leads to a scaling hierarchy of correlation functions : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the volume - averaged @xmath0-point correlation function , and the constant of proportionality depends weakly on the power spectrum or two - point function of the perturbations . even with an initially non - gaussian distribution , it may be possible to distinguish the primordial component from that due to gravitational evolution on large scales .",
    "the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model for structure formation invokes a mechanism such as an early epoch of inflation@xcite to generate primordial adiabatic density fluctuation .",
    "inflation results in a spatially flat universe overall ; quantum fluctuation of the inflaton field lead to an initially scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations ( with details possibly depending upon the specific model of inflation ) which evolve thereafter under the influence of gravity . in the simplest models of inflation ,",
    "this initial distribution of perturbations is gaussian , so the hierarchical results noted above obtain for the resulting correlation functions .",
    "the specific mechanism which drives inflation is inextricably linked to the fundamental particle physics model of the universe .",
    "of course , in addition to providing a mechanism for the generation of perturbations , inflation also has the advantage of solving the horizon and flatness problems which are otherwise left unexplained .    in another class of theories , topological defects ( or some other classical field configuration ) such as cosmic strings , domain walls or textures",
    "act as a continual source for the creation of density perturbations@xcite .",
    "these structures are the remnants of a symmetry - breaking phase transition of a cosmic field and are thus , like inflation , a cosmological relic of the underlying particle physics . in these scenarios ,",
    "the field is initially laid down randomly before the phase transition , on scales larger than the hubble radius at that time .",
    "once the symmetry is broken , the field tries to align itslef in order to minimize its energy density .",
    "however , this alignment can only occur coherently on scales where the field has come into causal contact with itself  within the hubble volume",
    ". as the universe expands , the hubble volume increases and the field orders itself on larger and larger scales  the kibble mechanism@xcite .",
    "if the symmetries of the field and its initially random configuration require it , topological defects may result .",
    "for example , a broken discrete symmetry like @xmath10 produces domain walls , a broken @xmath11 or @xmath12 symmetry can result in ( gauge or global ) cosmic strings , @xmath13 in monopoles , and global @xmath14 in global texture .",
    "the breaking of a global @xmath1 symmetry with @xmath15 does not lead to topological defects , but does result in spatial field gradients and consequently to perturbations to the energy density . unlike the inflationary scenario , the kibble mechanism quite generically produces density fluctuations with an initially non - gaussian distribution .",
    "( of course , these theories do not provide a natural solution to the horizon and flatness problems and in this case it is usually assumed that the universe begins in a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic state with @xmath16 before the symmetry - breaking phase transition .",
    "thus , in these models one relegates the solution of these puzzles to initial conditions , or to an earlier inflationary epoch driven by a field too weakly - coupled to produce the density perturbations responsible for large - scale structure . )    within the class of scenarios that create structure via the kibble mechanism , there is a further conceptual split between global and local ( or gauge ) symmetries . in a local theory ,",
    "the large - scale gradient energy of the field is compensated by the gauge field so all the field energy is concentrated in localized defects .",
    "thus , only true topologically stabilized configurations can result . in global theories , on the other hand , non - topological configurations ( textures )",
    "can result that are nonetheless long - lived because they require energy to `` unwind '' a configuration by forcing it off its vacuum manifold . in large-@xmath2 models",
    ", these field configurations persist simply because causality constrains them to align only on scales smaller than the hubble radius , so field gradients persist for approximately a hubble time .",
    "( also , a new class known as `` semi - local '' defects has been studied , in which a gauge theory admits defects which are stabilized by the dynamics of theory , not the underlying topology of the symmetry groups@xcite . )    in this paper , we shall modify and extend aspects of a formalism that has been developed by veeraraghavan and stebbins @xcite to study the perturbations due to a `` stiff source '' such as these cosmic field configurations formed by the kibble mechanism .",
    "a `` stiff source '' evolves in the homogeneous and isotropic background metric of the universe ; the back - reaction of the metric perturbations onto the source is considered to be negligible .",
    "we shall , however , explicitly account for compensation : the initial response of the matter fields to the stress - energy of the stiff source .",
    "we shall extend previous work to allow the perturbations of the matter and radiation fluids in the universe to enter the quasi - nonlinear regime and examine the modifications to the perturbative solution to the equations of motion that result .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to study the resulting correlation functions and may modify the scaling hierarchy in such scenarios .    using this formalism",
    ", we shall concentrate on a specific class of models in which the kibble mechanism is responsible for the initial generation of density perturbations , the nonlinear @xmath1 sigma model@xcite .",
    "these models arise as the low - energy limit of the breaking of a global @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath17 .",
    "although the analytic calculations we shall perform rely on the large-@xmath2 limit , in which there are only spatial gradients , but no topological defects , we can also extract some information about the behavior of this theory for small @xmath2 where defects play a role .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : formal ] , we develop the equations of motion for the stiff source in the background metric and of the matter fields in the perturbed universe , using the longitudinal gauge , and develop a perturbative expansion about homogeneity and isotropy . in section [ sec : sigma ] , we apply this formalism to the nonlinear sigma model , and examine the higher - order correlations of the matter . finally , we present our conclusions . in an appendix ,",
    "we show some useful results for the distribution of the fields in an @xmath1 model .",
    "we will consider linear metric fluctuations about a homogeneous frw background .",
    "we work in comoving conformal coordinates with metric signature @xmath18 and assume a spatially flat background metric of @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the minkowski metric . here",
    ", @xmath21 is conformal time , related to proper time by @xmath22 . throughout , we shall use a prime to denote the derivative with respect to conformal time , and define a conformal expansion rate @xmath23 .",
    "the unperturbed einstein equations in the flat ( @xmath16 ) freedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with mean background density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 and vanishing cosmological constant ( @xmath26 ) are @xmath27 in a matter - dominated universe ( @xmath5 ) , the scale factor @xmath28 and in a radiation - dominated universe ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 .",
    "the hubble constant is @xmath31 and the present hubble radius is @xmath32 .",
    "we normalize the conformal time by setting @xmath33 today .",
    "we will write the perturbed metric as @xmath34 in the longitudinal gauge ( @xmath35 ) to first order in @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    in the usual",
    "longitudinal ( often called conformal - newtonian ) gauge analysis , only scalar perturbations are considered , in which case the metric perturbations are determined by two scalar variables ( `` potentials '' ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in this paper , we will in addition allow nonzero vector and tensor perturbations , for which @xmath42 is nonzero .",
    "most analyses of density perturbations in an expanding universe have used the synchronous gauge ( @xmath43 ) @xcite ( although a gauge - invariant approach has recently become popular @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen the longitudinal gauge in order to more easily compare our results with the perturbative newtonian equations of motion ( and thereby gain insight into higher order correlations which have previously been studied only in the newtonian limit ) ; the price of this is retaining a nonzero component @xmath44 . more importantly , in the longitudinal gauge we can consider situations in which the density perturbation amplitude @xmath45 is large , while the metric perturbations are still small .",
    "a few more words about our approximation scheme are in order . because we shall only compute the einstein tensor to first order in the metric perturbation , the perturbed einstein equations @xmath46 ( where here @xmath47 represents the perturbation to all the stress - energy in the universe , including matter , radiation and any sources such as those discussed below )",
    "can only be considered first order  _ in the metric perturbation_. thus , we must ignore terms like @xmath48 for consistency .",
    "however , this does not determine the form that the stress - energy must take : it may contain @xmath49 or @xmath50 terms .",
    "( below , we shall calculate the four - velocity to order @xmath49 . )",
    "thus , these equations can be valid for `` large '' values of the density perturbation amplitude @xmath51 as long as we still have @xmath52 .",
    "note that this is a gauge - dependent statement .",
    "in fact , performing the same exercise in a comoving synchronous gauge , we find that @xmath53 to all orders in the matter perturbation variables for pressureless , nonrelativistic matter , so this scheme would not be successful  we can only use synchronous coordinates until streamlines of the matter flow intersect and caustics form .",
    "the advantage of the synchronous formalism is that one can define a comoving gauge where the nonrelativistic matter component has zero velocity for all time ( _ i.e. _ , as long as the coordinate construction is consistent ) . in the longitudinal gauge we are considering here we still have to calculate velocities . however , the gravitational potential ( metric perturbation ) in this gauge is in general suppressed compared to the density perturbation by the square of the size of the perturbation relative to the hubble radius , as in the usual newtonian poisson equation : @xmath54 for perturbations of scale @xmath55 .",
    "( of course , this equation is itself only applicable for scales smaller than the hubble radius , beyond which relativistic corrections become important as in _ e.g. _ , eq .",
    "( [ cdmsoln ] ) below . )    on scales smaller than the hubble radius , the metric perturbation remains small even when the matter perturbation becomes nonlinear .",
    "in particular , we expect this approximation to be valid as long as @xmath56 ; with first order quantities and the poisson equation to relate the potential to the density perturbation , this is equivalent to @xmath57 as expected , our approximation will continue to hold on scales much smaller than the horizon as long as @xmath58 .",
    "conversely , for sufficiently small scales the linear metric perturbation approximation holds for even larger values of the density perturbation .",
    "as long as the average source stress - energy is negligible compared to the fluid components and as long as we continue to ignore backreaction , this approximation holds in the same regimes as the normal newtonian limit .    in the longitudinal gauge",
    ", @xmath59 does not contain a scalar part as it does in the synchronous gauge , so in addition to being manifestly traceless , it satisfies @xmath60 .",
    "although the matter variables become more complicated when we allow higher - order terms to enter the equations , the metric perturbation is still usefully decomposed into geometrically distinct parts ( _ i.e. _ , scalar , vector and tensor)@xcite .",
    "normally , only the scalar part of the peculiar velocity , which can be expressed as the gradient of some velocity potential , appears in the equations of motion for other scalar quantities like the density perturbation @xmath61 . with higher order terms ,",
    "however , products like @xmath62 or @xmath63 decompose as a vector and symmetric tensor , respectively , with scalar , vector , and ( for @xmath63 ) tensor parts that are not simply related to the scalar and vector parts of the original @xmath64 .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath61 , although a scalar , can appear in higher - order equations containing the vector perturbations to the metric , and the vector part of @xmath64 can occur in the scalar equations of motion ( _ e.g. _ , eq .",
    "( [ g00 ] ) which contains @xmath65 ) .    as in @xcite ( who instead calculated in synchronous gauge )",
    ", we assume a universe filled with a multi - component perfect - fluid stress - energy @xmath66 , where @xmath0 labels the fluid component , as well as a `` stiff source '' with stress - energy @xmath67 .",
    "the source makes a negligible contribution to the spatially - averaged stress - energy and is covariantly conserved with respect to the _ background _",
    "metric @xmath68 : @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the spatial trace of the source stress energy .",
    "again , we do not consider the back - reaction on the stiff source of the metric perturbations . in principle",
    ", we could calculate it and its effects in an iterative , perturbative fashion , writing the full source stress - energy as a sum of a part propagating in the frw background as in eq .",
    "( [ stiffeq ] ) and another part propagating in the full perturbed metric .",
    "this perturbation would , in turn , be fed back into the field equations for the metric perturbation .",
    "this would result in new terms of order @xmath71 , still at linear order in the metric .",
    "unless either the source stresses or the metric perturbation are large , these terms should be negligible in comparison to those involving the linear fluid perturbations .",
    "the bulk of the universe is filled with several perfect fluids with individual stress - energies @xmath72 where @xmath0 labels the fluid component , @xmath73 and @xmath74 refer to the background density and pressure of each fluid , and @xmath75 , @xmath76 to their respective perturbations .",

    "we have kept terms of order @xmath49 , and ignored terms of order @xmath83 , for the consistency of our approximation scheme .",
    "( note that the form of the @xmath49 terms is exactly as one would expect from the usual special - relativistic four velocity expanded to this order . )",
    "we will assume that each of the perfect fluid components is separately conserved .",

    "physically , this is simple to understand : as a given mode enters the horizon , it comes into causal contact fairly quickly , on the order of a hubble time .",
    "after that , the field is roughly static , so its momentum density @xmath183 is small , and the matter perturbations are only generated on scales near the horizon .",
    "subsequently , they evolve under the influence of small - scale newtonian gravity alone .",
    "( however , it is not hard to imagine some other kind of stiff source with `` ordering physics '' that continues to be active on smaller scales which would result in density fluctuations that do not mimic the newtonian growing - mode result . )",
    "one traditional way to characterize the bispectrum is through the ratio @xmath346 which for an equilateral triangle becomes @xmath347 .",
    "the usual hierarchical result from the newtonian analysis with gaussian initial conditions is @xmath348 from second - order perturbation theory . with the non - gaussian initial conditions from the sigma model",
    ", we instead have @xmath349 from _ linear _ theory .",
    "the question remains , then , on what scales do we expect these linearly evolved moments to dominate over higher - order effects ? from section [ sec : nlstiff ] above , the leading nonlinear contribution to the higher moments is @xmath350 where this equation is actually only correct for @xmath351 with equilateral triangles , where @xmath352 .",
    "( for @xmath353 , the right - hand side of this equation should be a sum over the different `` tree - level '' graphs connecting the labelings of the wavevectors , each term with a corresponding constant @xmath354 @xcite .",
    "however , for analyzing the scale - dependencies here , the form above shall suffice . )",
    "consider the quantities @xmath355 which normalize the @xmath0-point spectra to @xmath356 .",
    "we see that the linear contribution is , of course , constant , @xmath357 whereas the nonlinear contribution grows with time , @xmath358 at a given wavenumber , the nonlinear contribution grows with time with respect to the linear contribution . a similar result for spatial correlation functions",
    "was derived for @xmath351 in @xcite , where they also included the effects of a primordial four - point function ( whose contribution to the skewness also grows with time ) .",
    "the ratio of the nonlinear contribution to that of the linear evolution is @xmath359^{n-2 } n^{n/2 - 1 } { g_2^{n-1}\\over g_n}(k\\eta)^{2n-4}\\ ] ] which goes as a positive power of @xmath175 for @xmath360 , so the nonlinear terms become more important on small scales , as expected .",
    "this is a function of @xmath271 , the ratio of the length involved to the horizon size , so the scaling nature of the solution is preserved .",
    "the scale of this crossover from the domination of the linear to the nonlinear evolution of the fields depends on the values of the @xmath313 for a given configuration of wavevectors and @xmath2 ( although the powers of @xmath2 explicitly cancel in the above expression , recall that the normalization of @xmath325 is such that factor in brackets above is constant ) .",
    "crossover thus occurs at scale @xmath361    actually , the full evolution of the three - point function depends on the four - point function ( or trispectrum @xmath362 ) as well@xcite , which we do not explicitly calculate here , but we expect this crossover scale to be independent of it , since from above we have @xmath363 so the trispectrum falls on small scales , at least for those greater than that of matter - radiation equality",
    ". moreover , the value of @xmath0 only enters these equations through the prefactor involving the @xmath364 and @xmath313 , which are not expected to vary greatly with @xmath0 .",
    "so , for increasing @xmath0 , the @xmath0-dependent part of the first factor in parentheses will be come less important , and the crossover scale becomes approximately @xmath365    if we naively plug the asymptotic values of @xmath366 and @xmath367 into eq .",
    "( [ knl ] ) , with the hierarchical value for equilateral triangles of @xmath368 we find @xmath369 for @xmath319 .",
    "if we let this quantity be a factor of 10 smaller as indicated above , then the crossover scale is reduced to @xmath370 . to calculate the scale at which the primordial four - point function or trispectrum becomes significant",
    ", we will use the hierarchical pattern @xmath371 for tetrahedral configurations , with @xmath372,@xcite so @xmath373 ( although observations@xcite are typically @xmath374 . )",
    "thus , @xmath375 spanning the range of possible normalizations of @xmath325 , where we have left the integral @xmath376 unevaluated , but expect it to be of order unity .",
    "even this scale , unfortunately , is just beyond the largest considered in surveys for higher - order power spectra , which have gone out to @xmath377 @xcite .",
    "we expect only the _ nonlinear _ contribution to the three - point function to be important on the smallest observable scales .",
    "if instead we use the second , large-@xmath0 form of @xmath378 , we find @xmath379 this is more possibly in the range of observed and observable scales , but still ( for @xmath380 where we expect to believe these results ) barely on the edge of current observations of the bispectrum and trispectrum .",
    "thus , the usual newtonian analysis of higher - order correlation should suffice there .",
    "unfortunately , that means that it will be more difficult to distinguish the nonlinear sigma model from simple gaussian theories on small scales using the mass distribution alone .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the large - scale normalization of the nonlinear sigma model to the cobe results may require an unreasonably large bias in order to match the galaxy distribution .",
    "more problematic is the calculation on scales that entered the horizon during the radiation - dominated period .",
    "a complete calculation requires the numerical integration of the equations of motion of the sigma model fields and the radiation and matter fluids as in @xcite .",
    "they present a possible parametrization of the transfer function which takes the power spectrum from @xmath314 on large scales to its small - scale form ( usually @xmath381 , possibly modulated by the logarithmic growth of modes in the radiation - dominated universe ) .",
    "however , the equivalent form has not been calculated for the three - point function .",
    "however , we do not expect the linear evolution to dominate on small scales .",
    "higher order or fully nonlinear effects tend to dominate on the smallest scales . in order for the linear correlations to be observable below the scale of matter - radiation equality",
    ", the linear bispectrum would have to increase relative to the nonlinear contribution on these scales .",
    "moreover , because of the form of eqs .",
    "( [ nsource ] ) , the relative importance of higher order effects with respect to linear effects is again expected to be the same as in the purely newtonian case .",
    "as we have seen , the nonlinear sigma model is not expected to give non - gaussian results for higher - order correlation functions on as - yet observed scales .",
    "so far , all observations are consistent with newtonian hierarchical results with gaussian initial conditions .",
    "baumgart and fry @xcite actually analyze the @xmath0-point power spectra for two galaxy surveys and find that @xmath382 ( for equilateral triangles ) for @xmath383 .",
    "this is exactly the value expected from the newtonian theory with gaussian initial conditions .",
    "they also calculate @xmath384 ( for regular tetrahedral configurations ) , a result which is weakly consistent with the hierarchical expectation .",
    "more recent results of analyses of the iras dataset are also consistent with the hierarchical expectations .",
    "_ @xcite have calculated the volume - averaged @xmath0-point functions @xmath9 for @xmath385 and again find that the hierarchical form holds : @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , nusser _",
    "et al._@xcite have reconstructed the _",
    "one - point probability density function for the smoothed iras density field ( using an algorithm based on newtonian gravity and the zeldovich approximation ) and found it to be consistent with a gaussian distribution on scales smaller than about @xmath386 .",
    "it may be possible to examine the @xmath0-point functions at still larger scales using two - dimensional angular correlations @xcite .",
    "however , an angular analysis introduces errors due to uncertainties in the luminosity function of galaxies and consequently the survey s selection function , especially on the large scales we are most interested in .",
    "nonetheless , gaztaaga@xcite has estimated the @xmath0-point angular correlation functions for the apm dataset and found that the results are consistent with an initially gaussian distribution for scales out to about @xmath387 ; however , this is still below the scales required to see any possible effects of a sigma - model field .",
    "precise measurements of the bispectrum and trispectrum out to scales of @xmath388 should be sufficient to begin to more explicitly test this model .",
    "we should expect the next generation of survey results for higher - order correlations to at least begin to probe the scales on which primordial non - gaussianity from a sigma - model source should be observable , at least for moderate values of @xmath2 . that we do not yet observe a marked increase in the three- , four- , or five - point functions ( or their spectral counterparts ) on the largest scales implies that the density field on those scales remains dominated by newtonian evolution .",
    "if this observational trend continues , then any crossover to linear evolution will be on still larger scales , and we will be able to make stronger statements about the normalization or existence of any sigma - model field ( _ e.g. _ , using eq .",
    "( [ knl ] ) ) .",
    "we re - emphasize the fact that observations of the scaling hierarchy of correlation function do not imply gaussian initial conditions , even on the scale of the observations .",
    "as we have seen here , the correlation functions on small scales are dominated by the contributions from the initially gaussian component of the density field , which evolves nonlinearly into the quasi - gaussian scaling hierarchy .",
    "this behavior is expected to be generic to any scenario with non - gaussian initial conditions , as the nonlinear evolution should in any case dominate on small scales",
    ".    other observational ramifications of the sigma - model may be more damning even today . as pen _",
    "et al._@xcite point out , normalization of the microwave distortions produced in these models to the cobe observations require what may be an uncomfortably high bias , @xmath389",
    ". moreover , the detailed fit of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations ( determined from numerical simulations ) to the measured qdot galaxy distribution seems to require a bias of order 6 on scales of @xmath390 .",
    "we have developed a formalism to examine the quasi - nonlinear behavior of perturbations in a universe with a `` stiff '' source . in particular , we have shown that their evolution is formally very similar to those encountered in a purely newtonian analysis with an initial perturbation spectrum , but without a source . in the particular case of the nonlinear sigma model",
    ", we find that the behavior of higher correlation functions of the density field on extreme subhorizon scales is exactly the same as that which occurs with primordial _",
    "adiabatic _ perturbations .",
    "on larger , currently unobservable , scales , two effects occur that might differentiate the sigma model .",
    "first , the sigma model ( at least at moderate @xmath2 ) , has an initially non - gaussian distribution , which might be observed on scales of several hundred megaparsecs .",
    "furthermore , we find that the density perturbations are actually being created on scales comparable to the horizon , where the self - ordering physics of the source is occurring . unfortunately , the prospects of observing effects on these scales are slim .",
    "however , it may be possible to invent models in which the equivalent self - ordering occurs on smaller scales as well . unfortunately , the chief candidates  defect theories like cosmic strings  are ill - suited for this analysis , because the gravitational effects of defects generally occur on too small a scale . therefore , a quasi - nonlinear analysis is insufficient and full - blown numerical simulations must be performed .",
    "there are several possible extensions to the work we have presented here .",
    "we have concentrated on scalar perturbations , because those result in the readily - observable density fluctuations , even when higher - order terms in the matter variables are present . by considering vector and tensor perturbations",
    ", we can go beyond this and calculate quantities like the full velocity field ( including any possible vortical part ) , as well as the tensor perturbations ( gravitational radiation ) from the stiff source .",
    "if we consider a universe filled with both matter and radiation fluids , it should be possible to use this formalism to make accurate calculations of microwave anisotropies in these theories . if we have also calculated the gravitational radiation , then we can separate out the scalar and tensor components @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be possible to extend the cosmological post - newtonian suite of approximations@xcite to include the possibility of a stiff source .",
    "because this involves going to a higher order in the metric perturbation , things become considerable more complicated , but such approximations are often useful even when perturbations have become extremely nonlinear .",

    "i would like to thank albert stebbins for many useful discussions and especially thank my advisor , joshua frieman , for guidance throughout the project .",
    "this work was supported in part by the doe at the university of chicago and by the doe and by nasa through grant nagw 2381 at fermilab .",
    "in the nonlinear @xmath1 sigma model , the fields @xmath241 are constrained to lie upon the vacuum manifold , an @xmath248-sphere of radius @xmath325 , where they will be distributed uniformly in the absence of any further symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the probablity density will be proportional to the solid angle on the @xmath248-sphere .",
    "we are concerned , however , with the distribution of the @xmath241 , the cartesian components of the fields . in this coordinate system , there is always one component given by @xmath398 , and , due to the symmetry of the system , we can calculate the distribution of any single cartesian component : @xmath399 where @xmath400 are constants determined by the requirement that @xmath401 , and we have made the change of variables @xmath402 .",
    "this gives @xmath403 this distribution has mean @xmath404 and variance @xmath405 ( which can be calculated directly or seen from the constraint @xmath406 ) . the higher moments are given by @xmath407 which behave as @xmath408 for large @xmath2 ; the odd-@xmath409 moments vanish due to the symmetry of the distribution .",
    "for large @xmath2 , @xmath410    we wish to compare this to a gaussian distribution with some width @xmath411 , @xmath412 for small @xmath413 and large @xmath2 , @xmath414 which implies @xmath415 to first order in @xmath328 , as expected from @xmath416 and the expression for the higher moments of the gaussian distribution at large @xmath2 . for @xmath417 , both @xmath418 for large @xmath2 or small @xmath411 (",
    "although the ratio @xmath419 can be quite large for a finite value of @xmath2 ; this is because the gaussian is normalized over the interval @xmath420 ) .",

    "then , the components of the field become more and more strongly peaked about @xmath426 .",
    "note that this distribution is applicable only on superhorizon scales , where the ordering dynamics of the field are unimportant . within the horizon",
