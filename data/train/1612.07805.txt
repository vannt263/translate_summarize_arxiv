    "in this supplemental material , we describe in more detail how correlation functions can be expanded in terms of the diagrams described in the paper .",
    "we also derive the scaling properties of different types of diagrams for various ranges of @xmath2 , and provide some additional details on the derivation leading from eq . to eq . of the main text .    as a preliminary remark",
    ", we emphasize that the scaling of @xmath95 and @xmath32 in the large @xmath5 limit can not be understood by simply expanding @xmath30 as a power series in time .",
    "the reason is that , though squeezing does occur at short times ( and thus @xmath32 is indeed a small parameter ) , the existence of the large parameter @xmath5 makes it impossible to assign , a priori , preference to low - order terms in this expansion .",
    "this is the fundamental reason why a careful expansion to high orders in time , which we carry out diagrammatically , is necessary . as a simple ( though still subtle ) example , consider the @xmath3 case , which was first studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , one finds that while @xmath105 is a suitable small parameter , @xmath106 actually becomes large ( in the large @xmath5 limit ) at the time of optimal squeezing , as can be immediately verified by plugging in the scaling @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , a simultaneous expansion in both @xmath108 _ and _ @xmath109 is necessary to capture squeezing dynamics at low order . that such an expansion is not necessarily ( and indeed turns out not to be ) analytic in time confirms our initial statement that low orders in short - time perturbation theory will fail to describe spin squeezing .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to expand all two - spin correlation functions as series in time , and study the leading order contributions , in powers of the system size @xmath5 , at each order .",
    "understanding this scaling to all orders in time will allow us to identify suitable small parameters in which to expand @xmath7 , and to thereby identify its scaling with @xmath5 for non all - to - all interactions .            in the second line ,",
    "the subscript `` odd '' implies that , when expanding out a product of multiple @xmath112 s , we should only keep terms that have an odd number of cross terms of the form @xmath113 . in the third line , in light of the rules in fig.[fig : a_diagrams ] of the manuscript , the subscript implies that we should only keep diagrams with an odd number of wavy legs .      in the case of @xmath3",
    ", each black vertex contributes a power of @xmath5 to a diagram .",
    "given that each leg contributes a factor of @xmath114 , the leading diagrams at each order in time are all those with the same number of legs and black vertices .",
    "in the case of @xmath115 legs , such diagrams are proportional to @xmath116 . for @xmath58 , each vertex with a single leg",
    "contributes a factor of @xmath59 , while any vertex with more than one leg either converges or diverges less strongly with @xmath5 .",
    "this result is easy to check for a dashed - line vertex by analyzing the sums @xmath117 thus for @xmath118 a black vertex with a single dashed leg always diverges , and grows faster with system size than a black vertex with more than one leg .",
    "the contribution of a vertex with a single wavy leg depends on the positions of sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are eventually summed over . to analyze the contribution from such vertices we must therefore understand the behavior of @xmath119",
    "this sum can be estimated by converting it to an integral ; for example in 1d , using a continuous coordinate rescaled by the system size @xmath120 , we would have @xmath121 this integral converges for all @xmath122 whenever @xmath98 ( the singularities at @xmath123 are integrable ) , and thus the overall scaling of @xmath124 is determined entirely by the prefactor @xmath125 .",
    "for @xmath118 the integral remains finite even as @xmath126 , which implies that @xmath127 remains proportional to @xmath125 in the large @xmath5 limit even if the separations between sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 grows with the system size .",
    "thus we find that @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a function that stays finite in the limit of large ( i.e. on the order of the system size ) values of @xmath130 .",
    "the validity of the above derivation does not rely ( except in detail ) on the lattice structure or dimension , and hence we find more generally that @xmath131 . because the function @xmath129 tends to a finite value for extensively large separations , the summation over @xmath67 and @xmath68 yields two powers of the system size @xmath5 , and therefore the contribution of a diagram with @xmath115 legs and vertices scales as @xmath132 regardless of the types of legs .    in light of the above discussion , and still restricting our attention to the case @xmath118 , we can approximate the correlation function @xmath46 by keeping just the leading order contributions in @xmath5 at each order in time :      the set of diagrams with a single wavy leg can be simplified by factoring out the vertex common to all diagrams , and resumming the remaining diagrams to give @xmath133&=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i\\neq j}\\big(\\varphi_{il}\\exp(-\\sum_{k\\neq    i , j}\\varphi_{ik}^2)\\big)\\big(\\varphi_{jl}\\exp(-\\sum_{k\\neq    i , j}\\varphi_{jk}^2)\\big)\\\\ \\label{eqsom : a_vs_b_2 } & \\approx\\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{b}(t)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath60 means `` correct to leading order in @xmath5 '' at each order in time . the equality in eq .",
    "can be verified by recalling the definition of @xmath124 and exchanging summations : @xmath134 eq .   then follows immediately by expanding the @xmath135 functions in the definition of @xmath47 to lowest order ( which is correct to leading order in @xmath5 ) .",
    "this approximate equality is the origin of the similarity between @xmath46 and @xmath64 . we can also resum the entire series ( including any number of wavy legs ) to give @xmath136\\exp[-\\sum_{k\\neq i , j}(\\varphi_{ik}^2+\\varphi_{jk}^2)].\\ ] ] expanding the @xmath63 function to first order gives the @xmath64 contribution , while the @xmath137 and higher order terms give @xmath55 .",
    "now that we have the desired series representation for @xmath55 , and can see that the leading terms at order @xmath138 in time scale as @xmath132 .",
    "truncating this series to lowest ( @xmath139 ) order in time and plugging it into eq .",
    "of the manuscript leads immediately to eq .  .",
    "the situation for @xmath140 requires slightly more care .",
    "first of all , dashed legs ( @xmath141 ) now converge , and hence the diagrams with a single leg per vertex are not parametrically larger ( in @xmath5 ) than diagrams with the same number of legs but fewer vertices  hence we can not select a simple set of dominant diagrams at a given order in time . similarly , for fixed @xmath130 , @xmath127 no longer diverges in the large @xmath5 limit , as suggested by the prefactor in eq .  . indeed , for a separation @xmath130 that grows proportionally to the system size",
    ", @xmath127 actually tends to zero as a power law as @xmath34 .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the leading order contributions to @xmath46 are diagrams with only a single wavy leg , which suggests ( incorrectly ) that the leading contributions to @xmath55 might be of a different character than they were for @xmath118 .",
    "however , these leading order contributions are still precisely ( i.e. to leading order in @xmath5 ) canceled by the factor of @xmath64 in the definition of @xmath55 .",
    "the cancelation of this more general class of diagrams , which includes those having one wavy leg and other dashed legs connected to the same vertex , is a consequence of the identity @xmath142 , employed inside the products of equation eq .   _ before _ the expansion .    to determine the next - to - leading - order contributions",
    ", we note that for @xmath140 the integral in eq .",
    "has a power law divergence @xmath143 for small @xmath144 . in a diagram with @xmath115",
    "wavy legs , the summation over @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be converted into an integral @xmath145 because the inner integral has a singularity @xmath146 , the outer integral converges whenever @xmath147 , and so the overall scaling of the digram is determined by the prefactor @xmath148 . for",
    "@xmath149 the outer integral gains a system - size dependence ( due to the non - integrable singularity at @xmath150 ) @xmath151 , canceling the prefactor and causing the diagram to converge in the large @xmath5 limit . from this discussion",
    ", it follows that progressively higher order diagrams converge first as @xmath2 exceeds @xmath87 , and the last remaining divergent diagram contributing to @xmath55 , namely @xmath152 , converges for @xmath153 ."
