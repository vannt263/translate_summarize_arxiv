    "one of the important question in particle physics is the origin of neutrino masses and mixing . in type ii seesaw model @xcite , higgs triplet coupling to lepton doublet can generate neutrino mass terms once it develops non - trivial vacuum expectation value .",
    "a distinct feature of this model is the presence of doubly charged higgs bosons which can give a very clean signal at collider experiments @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover it can also explain the deviation in higgs - to - diphoton rate as measured by cms and atlas @xcite .    in this work @xcite",
    ", we study a novel signature of same - sign tetra - leptons ( ss4l ) allowed in some parameter space of the type ii seesaw model that has not been studied so far .",
    "when the mass splitting among triplet components is sizable and the doubly charged higgs boson is the lightest , the electroweak gauge interaction allows a fast decay of the neutral or singly charged component of the higgs triplet into the lighter singly or doubly charged component .",
    "therefore , pair - produced higgs triplet components can end up with a pair of same - sign doubly charged higgs bosons leading to same - sign tetra - leptons if their leptonic yukawa coupling is larger than the ratio of the triplet and doublet higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "the ss4l final state , which is almost background free , provides an excellent new channel to test the model and probe sizes of the higgs triplet vacuum expectation value and the mass splitting among the higgs triplet components at the lhc .",
    "in this model , the higgs sector of the standard model is extended with a @xmath0 @xmath1 scalar triplet @xmath2 in addition to a sm - higgs doublet @xmath3 .",
    "the leptonic part of the lagrangian which generates neutrino masses is @xmath4 and the scalar potential is @xmath5 ^ 2+\\lambda_3\\mbox{det}(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta ) + \\lambda_4(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi)\\mbox{tr}(\\delta^\\dagger\\delta)\\\\ & + & \\lambda_5(\\phi^\\dagger\\tau_i\\phi)\\mbox{tr}(\\delta^\\dagger\\tau_i\\delta ) + \\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\mu(\\phi^ti\\tau_2\\delta\\phi)+\\mbox{h.c.}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after the electroweak symmetry breaking with @xmath6 , the @xmath7 term in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) gives rise to the vacuum expectation value of the triplet @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath7 being real and positive .",
    "there are seven physical massive scalar eigenstates denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . under the condition that @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the mixing among doublet and triplet components is too small and thus the first five states are mainly from the triplet and the last from the doublet .",
    "we write the masses of the higgs bosons as @xmath17 the mass of @xmath14 is given by @xmath18 as usual .",
    "the mass splitting among triplet scalars can be approximated as @xmath19 furthermore , the sign of the coupling @xmath20 determines two mass hierarchies among the triplet components : @xmath21 for @xmath22 ; or @xmath23 for @xmath24 . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the scenario , where the doubly charged scalar @xmath25 is the lightest and thus it decays only to @xmath26 or @xmath27 , while @xmath28 ( @xmath11 ) decays mainly to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) unless the mass splitting @xmath31 is negligibly small . for more details ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mass splitting @xmath32 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 plays a crucial role for ss4l signal .",
    "the @xmath7 term in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , which is lepton number violating , generates not only the triplet vev @xmath33 but also @xmath34 : @xmath35 for a preferable choice of @xmath33 , @xmath32 can be comparable to the total decay rate of the neutral scalars , @xmath36 , enhancing the ss4l signal .",
    "depending on the triplet mass splitting @xmath31 and the triplet vacuum expectation value @xmath33 , the triplet scalars have different decay properties .",
    "when @xmath37 is the lightest , the possible decay channels for the triplet scalars are shown in table .",
    "[ decay ] .",
    "the decays of triplet scalars can be classified into three modes , a ) di - leptonic mode : which is proportional to yukawa coupling @xmath38 , b ) quark / di - boson mode : controlled by @xmath39 , and c ) gauge decay : due to @xmath40 gauge interaction which dominates if allowed kinematically .",
    ".[decay]possible decay channels for the triplet higgs bosons for @xmath41 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ invmass ] , we plot the reconstructed @xmath25 mass from the sample of selected ss4l events for both nh and ih neutrino mass scenarios at lhc14 with 100 fb@xmath42 integrated luminosity .",
    "the peaks in all plots correspond to @xmath43 decays while the broad part ( off - peak ) of distribution correspond to @xmath44 decays .",
    "we point out that a remarkable signal of ss4l , @xmath45 , is allowed in the type ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "such a signal at the lhc strongly depends on the mass splitting @xmath31 and the triplet vev @xmath46 when the doubly charged component @xmath25 is the lightest , larger @xmath31 allows more efficient gauge decay of the neutral component to the singly charged one and then to the doubly charged one .",
    "thus , a pair production of the triplet components at colliders can end up with producing @xmath47 whose branching fraction to ss4l becomes larger for smaller @xmath33 .",
    "another crucial ingredient for increasing the ss4l signal number is the @xmath12-@xmath13 mixing parameter @xmath48 which becomes smaller for smaller @xmath33 and larger @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , there appear optimal values of the model parameters which maximize the same - sign tetra - lepton signal .",
    "after studying such a behavior in the @xmath49 plane , we identified a benchmark point with @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev for maximized the signal numbers at the lhc . after making the typical selection cuts to identify four same - sign leptons",
    ", we have shown that one can obtain sizable event numbers for @xmath52 gev with integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath42 at the lhc14 to reconstruct the doubly charged higgs mass in both cases of the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy .",
