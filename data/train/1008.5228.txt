    "electroproduction of nucleon resonances has long been recognized as an important tool in the exploration of the nucleon structure at different scales .",
    "there is a growing consensus that perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) factorization based on hard gluon exchange is not reached at present energies ; however , the emergence of quarks and gluons as the adequate degrees of freedom is expected to happen earlier , at @xmath2 a few gev@xmath1 .",
    "measurements of the form factors in this transition region are planned at jefferson lab @xcite using the clas12 detector . in this talk",
    "such reactions are addressed from the theory perspective .",
    "i try to formulate the physics goals and explain an approach to the electroproduction of resonances that combines lattice calculations of wave functions at small transverse separations with dispersion relations and quark - hadron duality , known as light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts @xcite that at large momentum transfer the transition form factors become increasingly dominated by the contribution of the valence fock state with small transverse separation between the partons . in reality",
    "the dominance of valence configurations is likely to be achieved but `` shrinkage '' to small transverse separations does not seem to occur and also power counting rules based on helicity conservation do not work at moderate @xmath3 that we are able to study experimentally",
    ".    to be more specific , the nucleon valence state contains contributions with different orbital angular momentum @xmath4 . the leading contribution to form factors at large",
    "@xmath3 comes from the @xmath5 state@xcite : @xmath6[d^2\\vec{k}]}{6\\sqrt{x_1x_2x_3 } } \\,\\,{\\psi^{\\ell_z=0}(x_i,\\vec{k}_i)}\\times\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1.2cm}\\times \\big\\ {   \\big|u^\\uparrow(x_1,\\vec{k}_1)u^\\downarrow(x_2,\\vec{k}_2)d^\\uparrow(x_3,\\vec{k}_3)\\big\\rangle -\\big|u^\\uparrow(x_1,\\vec{k}_1)d^\\downarrow(x_2,\\vec{k}_2)u^\\uparrow(x_3,\\vec{k}_3)\\big\\rangle   \\big\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the three - quark light - cone wave function that depends on quark momentum fractions @xmath8 and transverse momenta @xmath9 . ] .    the simplification that occurs at asymptotically large @xmath3 is that the @xmath10dependence of wave functions becomes irrelevant and all necessary ( nonperturbative ) information is contained in the integral over transverse momenta @xmath11\\,\\ , \\psi^{\\ell_z=0}(x_i,\\vec{k}_i )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cutoff @xmath12 has to be imposed to make the integral converge .",

    "electroproduction of nucleon resonances at high @xmath3 gives access to three - quark wave functions , more precisely to the overlap integrals between the wave functions of the nucleon and the resonance .",
    "these overlap integrals are in general too complicated to be calculated in qcd directly and our strategy will be to reduce these integrals to convolutions of distribution amplitudes which can be constrained using lattice qcd .",
    "we believe that one important physics goal for such studies will be to compare das ( alias light - cone wave functions at small transverse separations ) of baryon states with opposite parity , e.g. @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that such `` parity - doublets '' are non - degenerate in qcd because of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "it is not known , however , whether this difference mainly affects the `` pion cloud '' or it is present at short distances already and affects momentum fraction distributions of valence quarks . moreover , there are indications@xcite that chiral symmetry is effectively restored in the spectra of higher - mass resonances and it would be extremely interesting to compare the corresponding wave functions .    the general strategy of combining the constraints on das from a lattice calculation with lcsrs to calculate the form factors is suggested in ref .

    "baryon states of different parity can be identified in a lattice calculation as those propagating forward or backward in ( imaginary ) time @xcite , so in fact the results for @xmath27 reported in ref .",
    "[ ] are essentially a byproduct of our calculation of the nucleon das@xcite .",
    "these results were obtained using qcdsf / dik gauge configurations with two flavors of clover fermions for two different @xmath28 values and several quark masses on @xmath29 lattices .",
    "the calculation was done using nonperturbatively renormalized three - quark operators@xcite with up to two derivatives imposing a ri-mom  like renormalization condition and converting the results to the @xmath30 scheme . in this way",
    "the mixing with `` total derivatives '' is automatically taken into account .",
    "this work will be continued , using larger lattices and smaller pion masses in order to minimize effects of the chiral extrapolation . in fig .  1 i present preliminary results@xcite of the new calculation using ca . 600 @xmath31 gauge configurations on a @xmath32 lattice with @xmath33 ( a = 0.0753 fm ) and pion mass @xmath34 mev ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "they are much closer to the physical point and show , for the first time , that for small pion masses @xmath37 becomes smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "this phenomenon still has to be understood .",
    "the results for shape parameters of the nucleon distribution amplitudes ( [ twist3 ] ) are shown on the right panel .",
    "one sees that coefficients of first - order polynomials @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be quantified , whereas contributions of second order polynomials are less constrained .",
    "the main reason for this are the @xmath42 discretization errors in the chain rule for derivatives @xmath43 which spoil energy conservation : after the ( nonperturbative ) renormalization we obtain for the sum of the quark momentum fractions @xmath44 instead of unity .",
    "this is one of the issues that have to be addressed in future studies .",
    "the main result so far is that the accuracy of modern lattice calculations is sufficient to detect differences in quark momentum fraction distributions in the nucleon and its parity partner state .",
    "our calculations support a qualitative picture suggested by qcd sum rules@xcite that the valence quark with the spin parallel to that of the nucleon carries most of its momentum , and for @xmath27 this effect appears to be even stronger . as an illustration we show in fig .",

    "all these results are preliminary and the study will be continued using larger lattices and smaller pion masses .",
    "the comparison of the nucleon and @xmath27 will remain our primary goal for some time , but the calculations will also be extended to the full @xmath25 and @xmath26 baryon octets and to the decuplets .",
    "the main problem that has to be addressed in future is the identification of resonance contributions for small quark ( pion ) masses such that strong decays , e.g. @xmath45 , are allowed",
    ". the separation of @xmath27 and @xmath46 may prove to be difficult .",
    "in particular the large decay width of @xmath27 in the @xmath47 channel has to be understood and it can only be addressed in lattice calculations with three flavors of dynamic fermions .",
    "discretization errors @xmath48 in the lattice definition of the relevant operators become a serious issue for second moments and have to be reduced in order that the results for @xmath49 coefficients become fully quantitative .",
    "the matrix element of the electromagnetic current @xmath50 between spin-1/2 states of opposite parity can be parametrized in terms of two independent form factors , which can be chosen as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the momentum transfer .",
    "the lcsrs are derived from the correlation function @xmath53 ) in terms of the das of @xmath54 .",
    "schematically , the sum rules take the form @xmath55\\ , c_{1,2;k}(x_i , q^2,s_0,m^2,\\mu,\\alpha_s(\\mu))\\,\\phi_k(x_i,\\mu)\\ ] ] where the sum goes over contributions of nucleon das of increasing twist and @xmath56 are the coefficient functions that can be calculated in qcd perturbation theory and modified using dispersion relations to include two nonperturbative parameters : @xmath57 , the interval of duality , and @xmath58 , the borel parameter which specifies the distance ( in imaginary time ) on which matching between hadronic and quark representations for the correlation function is being done .",
    "the dependence on @xmath58 is unphysical in the same sense as the factorization scale @xmath59 dependence in truncated perturbative expansions , but it is usually weak .",
    "the pqcd limit@xcite corresponds to the leading part of the contribution of leading - twist das at large momentum transfer , and the main difference is that higher - twist contributions are _ not _ suppressed by powers of @xmath60 , but rather of @xmath61 with @xmath62gev@xmath63 .",
    "the reason for this is that lcsrs take into account `` soft '' contributions to the form factors coming from large transverse separations .",
