    "the gaia all - sky survey , due to launch in spring 2012 , will monitor astrometrically , during its 5-yr nominal mission lifetime , all point sources ( stars , asteroids , quasars , extragalactic supernovae , etc . ) in the visual magnitude range @xmath2 mag , a huge database encompassing @xmath3 objects . using the continuous scanning principle first adopted for hipparcos",
    ", gaia will determine the five basic astrometric parameters ( two positional coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , two proper motion components @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the parallax @xmath8 ) for all objects , with end - of - mission precision between 6 @xmath1as ( at @xmath9 mag ) and 200 @xmath1as ( at @xmath10 mag ) .",
    "gaia astrometry , complemented by on - board spectrophotometry and ( partial ) radial velocity information , will have the precision necessary to quantify the early formation , and subsequent dynamical , chemical and star formation evolution of the milky way galaxy .",
    "the broad range of crucial issues in astrophysics that can be addressed by the wealth of the gaia data is summarized by e.g. , perryman et al .",
    "one of the relevant areas in which the gaia observations will have great impact is the astrophysics of planetary systems ( e.g. , casertano et al .",
    "2008 ) , in particular when seen as a complement to other techniques for planet detection and characterization ( e.g. , sozzetti 2009 ) .",
    "the problem of the correct determination of the astrometric orbits of planetary systems using gaia data ( highly non - linear orbital fitting procedures , with a large number of model parameters ) will present many difficulties .",
    "for example , it will be necessary to assess the relative robustness and reliability of different procedures for orbital fits , together with a detailed understanding of the statistical properties of the uncertainties associated with the model parameters . for multiple systems , a trade - off will have to be found between accuracy in the determination of the mutual inclination angles between pairs of planetary orbits , single - measurement precision and redundancy in the number of observations with respect to the number of estimated model parameters .",
    "it will constitute a challenge to correctly identify signals with amplitude close to the measurement uncertainties , particularly in the presence of larger signals induced by other companions and/or sources of astrophysical noise of comparable magnitude .",
    "finally , in cases of multiple - component systems where dynamical interactions are important ( a situation experienced already by radial - velocity surveys ) , fully dynamical ( newtonian ) fits involving an n - body code might have to be used to properly model the gaia astrometric data and to ensure the short- and long - term stability of the solution ( see sozzetti 2005 ) .",
    "all the above issues could have a significant impact on gaia s capability to detect and characterize planetary systems .",
    "for these reasons , within the pipeline of coordination unit 4 ( object processing ) of the gaia data processing and analysis consortium ( dpac ) , in charge of the scientific processing of the gaia data and production of the final gaia catalogue to be released sometime in 2020 , a development unit ( du ) has been specifically devoted to the modelling of the astrometric signals produced by planetary systems .",
    "the du is composed of several tasks , which implement multiple robust procedures for ( single and multiple ) astrometric orbit fitting ( such as markov chain monte carlo and genetic algorithms ) and the determination of the degree of dynamical stability of multiple - component systems .",
    "using galaxy models , our current knowledge of exoplanet frequencies , and gaia s estimated precision ( @xmath11 @xmath1as ) on bright targets ( @xmath12 ) , casertano et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown how gaia s main strength will be its ability to measure astrometrically actual masses and orbital parameters for possibly thousands of giant planets , and to determine the degree of coplanarity in possibly hundreds of multiple - planet systems .",
    "its useful horizon for planet detection ( encompassing @xmath13 stars ) extends as far as the nearest star - forming regions ( e.g. , taurus at @xmath14 pc ) for systems with massive giant planets ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) on @xmath17 au orbits around solar - type hosts , and out to @xmath18 pc for saturn - mass planets with similar orbital semi - major axes around late - type stars .    in summary",
    ", gaia holds promise for crucial contributions to many aspects of planetary systems astrophysics , in combination with present - day and future extrasolar planet search programs . for example",
    ", the gaia data , over the next decade , will allow us to a ) significantly refine of our understanding of the statistical properties of extrasolar planets , b ) carry out crucial tests of theoretical models of gas giant planet formation and migration , c ) achieve key improvements in our comprehension of important aspects of the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple - planet systems , d ) provide important contributions to the understanding of direct detections of giant extrasolar planets , and e ) collect essential supplementary information for the optimization of the target lists of future observatories aiming at the direct detection and spectroscopic characterization of terrestrial , habitable planets in the vicinity of the sun ."
