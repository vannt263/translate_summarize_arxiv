    "a great deal of effort has been directed to developing methods of detecting particle dark matter . over the past years and decades ,",
    "numerous studies have been conducted to assess the prospects for these various techniques @xcite .",
    "if dark matter consists of neutralinos , or another weakly interacting particle with a tev - scale mass , it is likely that one or more of these techniques will make the first detection of dark matter particles within the next several years .    of all of the candidates for dark matter that have been proposed ,",
    "none has received as much attention as the lightest neutralino in models of supersymmetry .",
    "supersymmetry is theoretically attractive for a variety of reasons . among the most compelling",
    "is its ability to provide a natural solution to the hierarchy problem  @xcite , and a common scale for the unification of the forces of the standard model  @xcite . from the standpoint of providing a dark matter candidate ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is naturally stable by virtue of r - parity conservation @xcite , and in many models is produced in the early universe in a quantity similar to the measured density of cold dark matter  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical techniques for detecting neutralinos include direct and indirect detection experiments .",
    "direct detection experiments attempt to observe neutralinos scattering elastically off of target nuclei .",
    "indirect detection experiments , in contrast , attempt to detect the annihilation products of neutralinos , including gamma - rays , neutrinos , positrons , anti - protons and anti - deuterons .",
    "direct and indirect detection measurements are of critical importance in determining the identity of dark matter .",
    "even if collider experiments were to observe a long - lived , weakly interacting , massive particle that appears to be a suitable dark matter candidate , such experiments will never be able to determine whether a particle is stable over cosmological timescales . to determine whether the dark matter of our universe is made up of such a particle ( either entirely , or in part )",
    ", direct and indirect detection experiments will be needed .    but looking beyond the mere detection of dark matter , what will these astrophysical observations reveal to us about the nature of particle dark matter ?",
    "in particular , is it possible to determine the properties of the lightest neutralino and the corresponding supersymmetry model by direct or indirect dark matter detection experiments ? in this article , we attempt to address these questions .",
    "while extracting such information from direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments is challenging , it may be possible in many scenarios .",
    "we have found that direct detection measurements of the neutralino s spin - independent elastic scattering cross section , rates in neutrino telescopes , and the brightness of gamma - ray lines ( from @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are among the most useful astrophysical probes for determining the properties of supersymmetry . in most cases , the value of @xmath0 ( or alternatively",
    ", the composition of the lightest neutralino ) can be constrained far more tightly if astrophysical data is included than it can be by lhc data alone .",
    "furthermore , in some models ( those in the @xmath3-funnel region of supersymmetric parameter space ) the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson can be determined by astrophysical experiments to within roughly @xmath4 gev , even if it can not be observed at the lhc .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the neutral electroweak gauginos ( @xmath9 ) and higgsinos ( @xmath10 ) have the same quantum numbers and , therefore , mix into four mass eigenstates called neutralinos . the neutralino mass matrix in the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath14 basis is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath0 are the bino and wino masses , and the higgsino mass parameter , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the weinberg angle , and @xmath2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the up and down higgs doublets .",
    "this matrix can be diagonalized into mass eigenstates by @xmath19 in terms of the elements of the matrix , @xmath20 , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath21 , or simply @xmath22 ) is the following mixture of gauginos and higgsinos : @xmath23 the absolute square of these coefficients are known as the bino , wino and higgsino fractions of the lightest neutralino , respectively .",
    "the composition of the lightest neutralino is a function of four supersymmetric parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this becomes further simplified if the gaugino masses are assumed to evolve to a single value at the scale of grand unification , as they often are . requiring that @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath24 ( @xmath24 being the gluino mass ) evolve to the same value at the gut scale yields the following ratios at the electroweak scale :",
    "@xmath25 adopting this relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we plot the composition of the lightest neutralino as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath0 in figure  [ comp10 ] for the case of @xmath26 . in each frame , the solid lines represent contours of constant bino , wino or higgsino fraction , as labeled .",
    "the dashed lines represent contours of constant neutralino mass , in gev . for @xmath27",

    "the annihilation cross section of the lightest neutralino is important for determining its thermal abundance in the universe , and for determining the fluxes of neutralino annihilation products that may be observed in indirect detection experiments .",
    "furthermore , by studying future signals from indirect detection experiments , such as the spectrum of gamma - rays generated in the annihilations of neutralino dark matter , the annihilation modes of the lightest neutralino could ( in principle ) be identified .",
    "neutralino annihilations which generate these signals take place in situations in which the neutralinos are traveling at velocities far below the speed of light .",

    ", this process can contribute significantly for either a mixed bino - higgsino or a pure bino .",
    "the contribution from @xmath34 boson exchange is given by : @xmath47 which scales simply as the square of the difference of the two higgsino fractions , @xmath48 .    before moving on to neutralino annihilations to bosonic final states ,",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "firstly , all annihilation channels to fermions strongly prefer heavy fermions in the low velocity limit ( @xmath49 ) . secondly , interference terms between each of these three channels can be important and , in some cases , dominate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the complete cross sections , including interference terms ) .",
    "neutralinos can annihilate to @xmath50 though t - channel chargino exchange , as well as s - channel exchange of a @xmath34 boson or cp - even higgs boson .",

    "the neutralino exchange diagrams yield : @xmath55 ^ 2 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that neither of these expressions contain the bino - content of the neutralino .",
    "both channels to @xmath50 and @xmath54 are most important for neutralinos with a large higgsino component ( or a large wino component in the case of @xmath50 ) .",
    "neutralinos can also annihilate to pairs of higgs bosons , or to a higgs boson along with a @xmath56 or @xmath34 boson .",
    "possible final states include @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , although processes to @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath66 and @xmath63 do not contribute in the low velocity limit . of the contributing final states , those including a higgs and a gauge boson ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 ) are generally more important than higgs - only final states , so we focus on those here .",
    "neutralino annihilations to @xmath64 and @xmath65 can proceed through the t - channel exchange of a neutralino , or the s - channel exchange of @xmath34 or @xmath3 , all of which contribute in the low velocity limit .",
    "similarly , neutralinos can annihilate to @xmath67 through t - channel chargino exchange , or the s - channel exchange of @xmath33 , @xmath5 or @xmath3 , of which chargino and @xmath3 diagrams contribute in the low velocity limit .",
    "the cross sections to these final states are larger for higgsino - like neutralinos , but decrease more slowly with increasing bino - fraction than annihilations to @xmath54 or @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , annihilations through an @xmath3 to @xmath64 and @xmath65 are proportional to @xmath68 rather than some combination of @xmath69 and @xmath70 to the fourth power , as is the case for annihilations to @xmath54 or @xmath50 . for",
    "this reason , annihilations to @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 dominate over those to @xmath54 or @xmath50 for neutralinos with a substantial bino fraction .",
    "as the expressions for neutralino annihilations to final states including higgs bosons are very lengthy , we do not reproduce them here .",
    "for further details , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "although neutralinos do not annihilate at tree level to @xmath71 or @xmath72 , a large number of one - loop diagrams contribute to these processes  @xcite . although the cross sections for annihilations to these final states are considerably smaller than to heavy fermions , gauge or higgs bosons , they are important because they produce mono - energetic gamma - ray lines , potentially providing a clear and distinctive signature in indirect detection experiments .",
    "neutralino annihilations to @xmath71 and @xmath72 result in gamma - ray lines with energies of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "although the expressions for the cross sections to these final states are too long to reproduce here , we will briefly point out a few common features . in most cases ,",
    "the largest contributions come from diagrams with a chargino-@xmath56 loop .",
    "each term in the amplitude from these processes is proportional to one of the higgsino fractions ( @xmath68 , @xmath75 ) , to the wino - fraction ( @xmath76 ) , or to some combination of these three ( @xmath77 , etc . ) .",
    "the bino content of the lightest neutralino does not contribute to this class of diagrams .",
    "roughly speaking , we expect the annihilation cross section to gamma - ray lines to scale with the square of the higgsino fraction ( or possibly the wino fraction ) of the lightest neutralino .",
    "even a pure - higgsino or pure - wino , however , has an annihilation cross section to @xmath71 and @xmath72 of around or less than @xmath78 @xmath79/s , which is less than 1% of the value needed to generate the observed thermal abundance .",
    "lines are , therefore , always a small fraction of neutralino annihilation final states .    in addition to diagrams with a chargino-@xmath56 loop",
    ", diagrams involving a sfermion - fermion loop can generate the leading contribution to gamma - ray lines , in particular in the case of light sfermions .    in fig .",
    "[ linesplot ] , we plot the neutralino s annihilation cross section to gamma - ray lines ( in the low velocity limit ) as a function of higgsino composition . in models with heavy squarks ( black points",
    "each represent models with @xmath80 tev ) , these cross sections are almost always dominated by @xmath56-chargino loop diagrams , and therefore a strong correlation emerges between the higgsino fractions and the cross sections to @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this correlation is less strong among models with light squarks .",
    "these results , and the results shown in the other scatter plots included in this paper , were calculated using the darksusy package @xcite .     +   +   +      to summarize the content of this section",
    ", we will here briefly discuss under what circumstances the various above mentioned neutralino annihilation modes are likely to dominate . to study this more concretely ,",
    "we have plotted in figures  [ ann10 ] and [ ann50 ] the fraction of neutralino annihilations which go to various final states as a function of the neutralino s bino - content .",
    "each of the frames in these figures follow a contour of constant mass , such as those shown in figure  [ comp10 ] .    as a first case , consider a somewhat light neutralino , such that higgs bosons , gauge bosons and top quarks are not kinematically accessible final states .",
    "such a neutralino will annihilate almost completely to bottom quarks and tau leptons .",
    "if the sbottoms and staus are sufficiently heavy to not contribute , the leading annihilation channel will be through @xmath3 exchange .",
    "the ratio of bottoms to taus produced through this channel is simply the ratio of the masses squared and the color factor , @xmath81 . although interference terms from @xmath34 and @xmath3 exchange diagrams can modify this ratio somewhat , annihilations to bottom quarks with a tau admixture of a few to ten percent is robustly predicted in the case of a light neutralino with much heavier sfermions .",
    "if the sfermions are not so heavy , however , and sfermion exchange diagrams to fermion pairs are substantial , then the ratio of annihilations producing bottoms and taus can be much larger or smaller . this depends on the sbottom and stau masses and on competition between sfermion exchange diagram and various interference terms .",
    "for example , in figures  [ ann10 ] and [ ann50 ] , changing the sfermion masses from very heavy ( 10 tev ) to 300 gev and [ ann50 ] once splitting has been taken into consideration .",
    "although we have minimized the mass splitting by adopting @xmath82 soft terms much smaller than the sfermion masses , off diagonal terms in the sfermion mass matrices are proportional to @xmath83 for up - type fermions and @xmath84 for down type fermions , and can be large for bino - like neutralinos .",
    "] has the effect of slightly increasing the fraction of annihilations which produce taus .",
    "we next consider a neutralino heavier than the gauge bosons . in this case , since annihilations to @xmath85 and @xmath54 have cross sections which approximately scale with @xmath86 , neutralinos annihilate primarily to fermions unless their higgsino fraction is rather large .",
    "if the lightest neutralino is heavy enough to annihilate to higgs boson pairs , or to a gauge boson along with a higgs boson , these modes are often important .",
    "as said before , annihilations to @xmath64 and @xmath65 are in cases proportional to @xmath87 rather than to the forth power , as is the case for annihilations to @xmath54 or @xmath50 .",
    "for bino - like or mixed bino - higgsino neutralinos , these annihilations ( especially those to @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 ) dominate over those to @xmath54 or @xmath50 .",
    "whether these modes occur more often than those to fermion pairs depends on features such as the value of @xmath2 , the sfermion and @xmath3 masses , and the precise composition of the neutralino . for heavy neutralinos",
    ", annihilations to top quarks can also be significant , especially in models with low or moderate @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the annihilation fractions , in figures  [ ann10 ] and  [ ann50 ] we plot the thermal relic abundance of the lightest neutralino , and compare this with the quantity of cold dark matter measured by wmap  @xcite ( @xmath88 at the @xmath89 confidence level ) .",

    "the most dramatic variations occur when @xmath16 is not related to @xmath17 by the gut relationship .",

    "the large overall annihilation cross section leads to a thermal abundance well below the measured dark matter density , however , and thus amsb scenarios require a non - thermal mechanism to generate the universe s dark matter  @xcite .",
    "assuming that such a process exists to generate the observed dark matter density in the form of wino - like neutralinos , this also leads to large cosmic positron and anti - proton fluxes  @xcite , possibly capable of generating the positron excess observed by the heat experiment @xcite ( and to some degree by ams-01  @xcite ) without a large degree of local inhomogeneities ( _ ie .",
    "_ without a large boost factor )  @xcite .",
    "the elastic scattering cross section of the wino - like neutralinos found in these models , in contrast , is somewhat smaller than is found in most other supersymmetric scenarios  @xcite .",

    "if we look beyond the mssm to models such as the nmssm ( the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ) , even lighter neutralinos are possible @xcite .    if , instead of adopting a single scale for the sfermion masses , we had selected values of @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 each independently ( and independently for each family as well ) , the spectrum of squarks and sleptons could be considerably different from those considered in our study . in scenarios",

    "this leads roughly to @xmath303 .",
    "therefore , within the cmssm , sleptons lighter than squarks are often predicted , particularly in the case of sfermions lighter than or comparable in mass to @xmath17 .",
    "the masses of the sleptons are not of particularly great importance for our study , however , as they do not effect the neutralino spin - independent or spin - dependent elastic scattering cross sections with nucleons , and typically contribute little to the neutralino annihilation cross section to lines .",
    "the most important effect of the sleptons is in the relic density calculation .",
    "if sleptons only slightly heavier than the lightest neutralino are observed at the lhc , for example , some of our conclusions may be modified .",
    "of course there is another important assumption we have adopted throughout this study : that the spectrum of new particles being observed at colliders and in astrophysical experiments are supersymmetric particles .",
    "even if a number of superpartners are discovered at the lhc , it is not at all clear that those particles will be identified conclusively as such .",
    "in particular , it has shown to be a challenge to distinguish supersymmetry from models with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) at the lhc  @xcite , especially if the kaluza - klein states appear with masses of @xmath304 tev or above .",
    "fortunately , the kaluza - klein dark matter found in these models  @xcite possesses features which could potentially be distinguished from neutralinos , such as a high neutrino rate from the sun  @xcite , a hard positron spectrum  @xcite and fairly predictable direct detection rates  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other scenarios , such as t - parity conserving little higgs models  @xcite , may be challenging to distinguish from supersymmetry at the lhc , but might be assisted by dark matter observations .",
    "in this article , we have studied the ability of astrophysical dark matter experiments to constrain the parameters of supersymmetry .",
    "a number of observable quantities can be useful in this respect , including rates at direct detection experiments , the flux of high - energy neutrinos from the sun , the brightness of gamma - ray lines and the flux of high - energy cosmic positrons .    in exploring ways to use these observables to learn about the properties of supersymmetry",
    ", we have exploited a number of correlations :    * in the case that the scalar ( spin - independent ) neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross section is relativity large ( @xmath305 pb ) , this process is dominated by the exchange of the heavy , cp - even higgs boson , coupled to @xmath306 and @xmath307-quarks . in this case , the cross section scales as @xmath308 . for smaller cross sections , contributions from light cp - even higgs exchange and squark exchange can also play dominant roles , making the correlation less powerful , but still potentially useful . * as constraints on the spin - independent , neutrino - nucleon elastic scattering cross section become stronger , the only way that an observable flux of high - energy neutrinos from neutralino annihilations in the sun could be generated is if neutralinos are captured in the sun primarily through spin - dependent ( axial - vector ) couplings . in observable models , this is dominated by @xmath34-exchange diagrams , leading to the strong correlation , @xmath309 .",
    "the rate in a neutrino telescope scales with this quantity as well ( as long as the neutralino mass is well above the energy threshold of the experiment ) . * in most models ,",
    "the neutralino annihilation cross sections to gamma - ray line producing final states ( @xmath310 ) are dominated by diagrams that include a chargino-@xmath56 loop . in this class of diagrams ,",
    "the cross section scales as some combination of the higgsino and wino fractions of the neutralino . a measurement of the annihilation cross section to gamma - ray lines ( or even the relative fraction of annihilations which produce lines )",
    "could be used to constrain the higgsino and wino components of the lightest neutralino .",
    "* the total neutralino annihilation cross section ( in the low velocity limit ) depends on a large number of supersymmetric parameters .",
    "nevertheless , this quantity would have some discriminating power if it could be determined by measurements of the cosmic positron spectrum , which samples the dark matter annihilation rate in the local halo .",
    "although the mass of the lightest neutralino will likely be measured to roughly 10% precision at the lhc , its composition will be considerably more difficult to constrain . to study the ability of astrophysical observations to assist in determining the composition of the lightest neutralino , we have considered a number of benchmark models .",
    "asumming that the mass of the lightest neutralino and the squark masses ( and in some cases @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) can be measured at the lhc , we performed parameter scans looking for models consistent with a given set of lhc observations , and consistent with the measured dark matter density . comparing the distribution of the value of @xmath0 among these models ( or alternatively , the higgsino fraction of the lightest neutralino ) to the distribution after constraints from plausible future astrophysical observations were made",
    ", we find that in many scenarios , the astrophysical measurement can play an important role in determining the value of @xmath0 ( or the higgsino fraction ) .",
    "in particular , we have found that :    * in the majority of our benchmark models ( lt1 , lt3 , lt4 , im2 , im3 , im4 and hv3 ) , we found that the inclusion of information from astrophysical dark matter experiments ( most importantly direct detection ) allowed for a constraint on the magnitude of @xmath0 ( or alternatively , the higgsino fraction of the lightest neutralino ) that is considerably more stringent than can be obtained from collider experiments and relic density considerations alone .",
    "in addition to the important role of direct detection in constraining @xmath0 , we note that in those models which generate an observable neutrino flux from the sun ( im2 , im4 and hv2 ) that @xmath311 ( and the higgsino fraction ) are quite tightly constrained by this measurement .",
    "this is further enhanced by the very large annihilation cross sections neutralinos have to @xmath71 and @xmath72 in these models .",
    "none of these measurements assist significantly in determining the sign of @xmath0 . * in a few of the benchmark models , astrophysical dark matter measurements provide far less information regarding the value of @xmath0 ( and the higgsino fraction ) .",
    "for the case of model lt2 , for example , nearly all of the supersymmetric models we found which were consistent with the projected measurements at the lhc were also found to predict similar elastic scattering cross sections and other astrophysically relevant quantities .",
    "for this reason , astrophysical measurements provide little discriminating power , although can still provide a valuable confirmation .",
    "additionally , in the cases of models im5 and hv1 , little is learned about @xmath0 ( or the higgsino fraction ) from astrophysical measurements . in these cases ,",
    "the lhc will likely not be capable of measuring @xmath168 or @xmath1 , leading to a situation where a number of very different sets of parameters could lead to the measured relic abundance and astrophysical observables .",
    "this is further exasperated by the significant role of coannihilations in the freeze - out process of model im5 and of the resonant annihilations through the cp - odd higgs in model hv1 .",
    "* in two of our benchmark models ( im1 and hv1 ) , the mass of the cp - odd higgs could be quite constrained by astrophysical dark matter measurements .",
    "this is very interesting considering that in these models , @xmath3 is too heavy and @xmath2 is too small for heavy neutral mssm higgs bosons ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 ) to be detected at the lhc . in each of these models ,",
    "neutralino annihilations in the freeze - out process is dominated by the resonant exchange of a cp - odd higgs .",
    "when direct detection experiments determine that the lightest neutralino s elastic scattering cross section with nucleons is very small ( @xmath312 and @xmath313 pb , respectively ) , it demonstrates that these neutralinos are quite bino - like ( a small higgsino fraction ) .",
    "this is further supported by the small annihilation cross section to @xmath71 and @xmath72 and the small rate in neutrino telescopes found in these models .",
    "a very bino - like neutralino requires an annihilation resonance ( or possibly coannihilations ) to avoid being overproduced in the early universe , thus it can be determined that @xmath314 . in such models , @xmath1 can be constrained in this way to roughly @xmath4 gev . *",
    "we have also studied the ability of astrophysical measurements to be used to constrain the quantity @xmath168 .",
    "we find that the prospects for this determination are far less optimistic .",
    "if low energy supersymmetry exists in nature , it will likely be discovered in the next few years at the lhc ( or possibly at the tevatron ) . over roughly the same period of time , the prospects for direct and indirect searches for neutralino dark matter are also very encouraging .",
    "each of these windows into the characteristics of supersymmetry can provide us with useful and complementary information . in this paper",
    ", we have studied the ability to constrain the parameters of supersymmetry , beyond what can be done at the lhc , using direct and indirect dark matter experiments .",
    "although the presence of a neutralino lsp can in most cases be confirmed at the lhc , the composition and corresponding couplings of such a state will likely go unconstrained by such an experiment . direct and indirect dark matter experiments , on the other hand , can probe the lightest neutralino s interactions with nucleons and with themselves ( annihilations ) , potentially allowing for a determination of its composition ( and the value of @xmath311 ) .",
    "we also find that direct and indirect dark matter measurements , combined with relic abundance considerations , can in some cases ( the @xmath3-funnel region ) determine the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) , even when beyond the reach of the lhc .      for a review of particle dark matter and its detection ,",

    "<S> in this article , we explore the ability of direct and indirect dark matter experiments to not only detect neutralino dark matter , but to constrain and measure the parameters of supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we explore the relationship between the phenomenological quantities relevant to dark matter experiments , such as the neutralino annihilation and elastic scattering cross sections , and the underlying characteristics of the supersymmetric model , such as the values of @xmath0 ( and the composition of the lightest neutralino ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we explore a broad range of supersymmetric models and then focus on a smaller set of benchmark models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that by combining astrophysical observations with collider measurements , @xmath0 can often be constrained far more tightly than it can be from lhc data alone . in models in the @xmath3-funnel region of parameter space , we find that dark matter experiments can potentially determine @xmath1 to roughly @xmath4 gev , even when heavy neutral mssm higgs bosons ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 ) can not be observed at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the information provided by astrophysical experiments is often highly complementary to the information most easily ascertained at colliders .    </S>",
