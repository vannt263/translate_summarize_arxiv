    "the strongest evidence for dark matter in galaxies comes from extended neutral hydrogen ( hi ) rotation curves of galaxies , and especially amongst all the galaxy types from dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) rotation curves .",
    "these systems are literally dominated by dark matter , their luminous matter usually bring only a minor dynamical contribution . from their extended hi distribution one can derive rotation curves to large galactocentric radii , probing very far out into the dark halo potential . for these reasons",
    "the dark matter halo parameters can be tightly constrained . and",
    "by studying extreme low - mass dirrs one gets a better handle on the dark halo scaling laws , since there are known correlations of the dark halo properties with galaxy types ( kormendy 1987 ) .",
    "the dirrs of our sample are dwarf members of the two nearest groups of galaxies outside the local group , sculptor at 2.5 mpc and centaurus a at 3.5 mpc .",
    "our parkes hi survey detected three dozens of dwarf members in these two groups ( see ct et al 1996 for a detailed description ) .",
    "five objects amongst the most gas - rich ones , with absolute magnitude m@xmath1 in the range @xmath2 to @xmath3 , were selected for kinematical studies : ugca 442 ( sculptor group ) , eso381-g20 , ddo 161 , eso444-g84 , and eso325-g11 ( centaurus a group ) .",
    "some of their optical parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    ".optical parameters of the selected dwarfs [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "hi mappings were done with the australia telescope ( 1.5 km & 3 km arrays ) and the very large array ( b / c & c / d ) , providing velocity resolutions of 3.3 and 5.2 respectively , and beam sizes ranging from 13 `` to 40 '' .",
    "the hi distributions extend well beyond the optical galaxies in all cases , out to 2 holmberg radii on average , which means for our dwarfs radii between 4 and 13 @xmath4 ( where @xmath4 is the optical disk scalelength ) .",
    "their velocity fields show the clear signature of large - scale rotation .",
    "these dwarfs are therefore gravitationally supported by rotation rather than pressure - supported by random motions ( since their velocity dispersions are much lower , see below ) . for lower luminosity systems the maximum rotation velocity ( @xmath5 ) decreases",
    "so one expects that eventually the random motions dominate in very small galaxies . here",
    "the range of magnitudes of our objects overlap with the lo et al 1993 local group sample which they found to be pressure - supported , although hoffman et al 1996 recently got higher @xmath5 for half of these dwarfs from arecibo mapping .",
    "so it seems that down to at least @xmath6 the systems are supported by rotation .",
    "inclined tilted - rings were fitted to the velocity fields to yield the rotation curves , allowing to model the warps which are found to be about 10on average ( in position angle and inclination ) , leaving low velocity residuals of the order of 5 . as is expected for such systems",
    "the rotation curves are seen to be slowly rising ( see figure 1 ) , however the flat part is reached in all cases , and the v@xmath7 range from 43  to 67 .",
    "the velocity dispersions are mostly uniform with an average value of 8 , which is similar to giant spirals where @xmath8 10 ( shostak & van der kruit 1984 ) .",
    "so indeed their @xmath5 is several times higher than their @xmath9 so that they are supported mainly by rotation , which allows us to build valid mass - models with their rotation curves , provided the velocities are corrected for asymmetric drift to take this pressure term into account ( skillman 1987 ) .",
    "multi - component mass - models have been fitted to the rotation curves ( figure 1 ) , which assume the mass distribution of a galaxy to consist of a stellar disk , a neutral gas disk , and a dark matter halo .",
    "the mass - components of the luminous material ( stars and gas ) are calculated from the surface brightness profile and the hi radial surface density profile , while a nonsingular isothermal sphere is used for the dark matter halo ( see carignan 1985 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk @xmath10 is a free parameter , it is applied to the luminosity profiles ( here obtained in i with the siding spring 2.3 m telescope ) to obtain the stellar mass surface densities .",
    "the dark matter halo has two free parameters , its core radius and its velocity dispersion , with its central density given by @xmath11 .",
    "of course the more extended is the rotation curve the better one can hope to constrain these parameters . also combining the hi rotation curves with optical h@xmath12 rotation curves in the inner parts , like we have here for ugca 442 and",
    "ddo 161 , helps better constraining @xmath10 .    for each dwarf a ` best - fit ' model and a so - called ` maximum - disk ' model ( @xmath10 being pushed to its maximal allowed value )",
    "were constructed .",
    "figure 1 shows the best - fit models .",
    "it is clear that the dark matter is in every case the most massive component , accounting for at least 54% and up to more than 92% of their total mass ( out to the last measured point of their rotation curves ) .",
    "they are definitely dark - halo dominated , and in fact even in the rising part of the rotation curve , except for eso325-g11 , the dark halo becomes already the major dynamical contributor and the stellar disk is not self - gravitating .",
    "this is also the case for other dwarfs like ddo 154 ( carignan & freeman 1988 ) , ddo 127 ( kormendy 1996 ) and ddo 170 ( lake et al 1990 ) in which the rotation curve is explained by dark matter even near the center .",
    "even the gas component is sometimes more dynamically significant than the stellar disk , like in ddo 161 or ugca 442 which has two times more mass in hi than in stars .",
    "so even if @xmath10 is the least well constrained parameter in our models , this does not impact very much on the total mass or mass - to - light ratio @xmath13 derived for these objects .",
    "let us now compare the dark halo parameters of our dwarfs with those of normal spirals , in order to inspect the halo scaling laws . kormendy ( 1990 ) pointed out that the central halo density seems to increase for galaxies of decreasing absolute magnitude . with their study of ddo 154",
    "carignan & freeman ( 1988 ) suggested that the ratio of dark to luminous matter ( @xmath14 ) gets larger for galaxies at the low mass end .",
    "our mass - models results confirm that the total mass - to - light ratio scales with luminosity , in the sense of course that lower luminosity galaxies have a higher ratio of dark matter mass to luminous mass than so - called normal galaxies .",
    "this is true even when comparing their dark matter and luminous masses at a particular radius , for example at a few times the stellar disk scalelength @xmath4 rather than at the last measured point at r@xmath7 ( otherwise galaxies with more extended hi rotation curves will be advantaged as more of their dark halo is sampled ) . in figure 2",
    "@xmath14 at a radius of 7 @xmath4 is plotted for a sample of galaxies for which rotation curves extend at least that far ( from the compilation of broeils 1992 ) .",
    "the results of our dwarfs maximum - disk models are added ( with lower limits in two cases because their rotation curves do nt reach 7 @xmath4 ) .",
    "it can be argued that comparing these masses at a certain optical radius , like @xmath15 or 7 @xmath4 here , is perhaps not the best choice considering that the stellar disk is so unimportant for dwarfs and therefore these values are not representative of the baryonic scalelength for a dwarf . nevertheless despite this",
    "the trend is clearly visible in figure 2 . for normal spirals",
    "@xmath14 is not far from @xmath161 ( which was noticed many years ago by bahcall & casertano 1985 for example ) , but is known to be a function of luminosity ( _ eg .",
    "_ persic & salucci 1988 , 1990 ) . at lower luminosity",
    "this increases very rapidly .",
    "the point at the top is ddo 170 ( lake et al 1990 ) ; also ngc 5585 ( ct et al 1991 ) has a high @xmath14 of 6.9 , as most low - surface - brightness galaxies seem to have higher fraction of dark matter ( see also de blok , this volume ) .",
    "one also notices that ddo 154 ( at m@xmath1=-13.8 ) is not an exceptional galaxy , other dwarfs of the same luminosity range have similar ( or even more extreme ! ) dark matter properties .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    looking now at the dark matter halo parameters , in figure 3 the central dark halo density is plotted for our dwarfs as well as a sample of 16 galaxies which have been modeled similarly using an isothermal sphere for the dark halo ( mainly from the puche & carignan 1991 compilation , see ct 1995 ) .",
    "like kormendy ( 1990 ) we notice an increase in @xmath17 for lower luminosity galaxies . but",
    "again , like in figure 2 , there is a large dispersion within the dirrs .",
    "this seems to indicate that galaxies with similar optical properties can have dark matter halos with fairly different properties .",
    "athanassoula et al ( 1987 ) also suggested that halos of early - type galaxies are more concentrated than those of later types .",
    "we also see a a trend that the ratio of the core radius over @xmath15 increases for our dwarfs ( but with a large spread here too ) .",
    "these trends have important implications for galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "indeed the cdm halos from n - body simulations with @xmath18 of navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) are not compatible with observed rotation curves : the cdm halos are substantially more concentrated than what is inferred from observations .",
    "navarro , eke & frenk ( 1996 ) have proposed that early bursts of star formation could expell a large fraction of the baryonic material in dwarfs therefore significantly altering the central regions .",
    "but low - surface - brightness galaxies , which can have quite large scalelengths and be massive objects ( de blok , this volume ) are also obsverved to be less concentrated than their simulated halos ; since they do not have the shallow potentials of dwarfs it is more difficult to create baryonic outflows to solve their concentration problem .",
    "navarro ( this volume ) proposes instead that lower concentration halos , compatible with dwarfs and lsbs observed curves , can be produced by low @xmath19 flat cdm models , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; it should be noticed that the inclusion of a compensating @xmath22 term is mandatory for @xmath23 models , since the way current simulations are constructed requires a flat geometry of the background cosmology ( buchert 1995 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    another possible clue about the nature of dark matter comes from the fact that in most spiral galaxies the ratio of the hi surface densities to dark matter surface densities ( @xmath24 ) are seen to stay remarkably constant ( bosma 1978 ) , even out to large radii ( carignan et al 1990 ) .",
    "this has been used as an argument for a strong coupling between the hi gas and the dark matter , hinting that the dark matter is not dissipationless , therefore has possibly a baryonic nature .",
    "one can then model the rotation curves using a scaled - up version of the hi disks ( ie : varying the gas mass ) rather than a dark matter halo ( see van albada , this volume ) and obtain reasonable fits ( sometimes even better ones , broeils 1992 ) . in our dwarfs",
    "however this is no longer true : the ratio of hi to dark matter surface densities start dropping appreciably at roughly the holmberg radius .",
    "figure 4 shows the case of ddo 161 ( for which @xmath253 kpc ) where this ratio @xmath24 drops by at least a factor of 10 ( similar factors are found for our other 4 dwarfs ) .",
    "many spirals have hi radial profiles measured out to a larger number of @xmath26 than some of our dwarfs ( see the whole sample of figure 3 for example ) and do not exhibit this decline in @xmath24 .",
    "so this could imply that not only different galaxies can have different fractions of dark matter but possibly a different mixture of dark matter flavours ( different fractions of baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter ) .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies are dark - matter dominated , the dark matter halos of our dwarfs account for 54% up to 92% of their total mass ( inside r@xmath7 ) . in most cases",
    "the dark halo is the major dynamical contributor already in the rising part of the rotation curve , and sometimes even the hi disk is more massive than the stellar disk .",
    "our mass - models results show that these lower luminosity galaxies have higher total mass - to - light ratios , and that their dark halos have higher central densities and are less concentrated , confirming the kormendy ( 1989 ) correlations .",
    "contrary to what is found in normal spirals , the ratio of hi to dark matter surface densities are no longer constant at large galactocentric radii .",
    "one can no longer fit scaled - up hi disks instead of dark halos to explain the rotation curves , since at large radii there is no longer a strong coupling between the hi gas and the dark matter .",
