    "this is usually reflected by an enhancement or a suppression of the ordering temperature .",
    "if the ordering temperature can be fully suppressed to zero , a quantum phase transition is accessed .",

    ", we refer to it as quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the interest in these zero - temperature singularities stems from the observation that finite - temperature properties show unconventional behaviour in the vicinity of a qcp .",
    "a theoretical description of quantum critical behaviour was derived by extending the theory of classical criticality to zero temperature.@xcite agreement between experiment and the predicted power laws and scaling relations was found in some cases , but pronounced deviation have also been observed .",
    "these latter have led to the development of scenarios where the criticality is not merely due to the vanishing of the order parameter but where another mode is simultaneously critical .",
    "a prominent example is the theory of local quantum criticality.@xcite in this theory of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) kondo lattice with strong two - dimensional spin fluctuations , in addition to the order parameter also the kondo interaction is suppressed to zero at the qcp .",
    "experimental evidence supporting this `` kondo destruction '' scenario has been reviewed recently.@xcite .",

    "it was recently pointed out that @xmath4 may be identified with spacial dimensionality and , in particular , that cubic compounds are good candidates for probing the global phase diagram in the limit of `` high dimensionality '' ( low @xmath4).@xcite    here we thus review cubic heavy fermion compounds for which low - lying phase transitions have been observed .",

    "in various cubic ce - based heavy fermion compounds , low - lying phase transitions have been observed and were shown to depend on non - thermal tuning parameters such as magnetic field or pressure . in some of these , the phase transition temperatures could be fully suppressed to zero ( or , more precisely , to a value below the accessible temperature range ) .",

    "in spite of the wealth of information on magnetic field- and pressure - tuned phase transitions in cubic ce - based heavy fermion compounds presented above , investigations of quantum criticality have been carried out only in few cases .",
    "an interesting early observation on ceb@xmath2 is that the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath92 of the fermi liquid ( fl ) contribution to the specific heat , @xmath93 , as well as the @xmath94 coefficient of the fl form of the electrical resistivity , @xmath95 , show cusp - like enhancements near the critical field for the suppression of the afm phase of about 1.3 t ( fig.[qcp]a).@xcite such field dependences are today considered as strong indications for quantum criticality .",
    "cein@xmath0 is certainly the most prominent ce - based quantum critical compound with cubic crystal structure.@xcite as discussed above , the nel transition can be continuously suppressed to zero by either a magnetic field or by pressure . in the vicinity of the critical pressure @xmath96kbar ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity shows clear deviations from fl behaviour and is better described by the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) form @xmath97 ( fig.[qcp]b).@xcite    also in ce@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath2 , quantum critical behaviour has been observed,@xcite with the electrical resistivity close to the critical field @xmath98 t being best described by a nfl form with an exponent @xmath99.@xcite the @xmath94 coefficient of the fl form , determined at the lowest temperatures away from @xmath100 , is strongly enhanced towards @xmath100 ( fig.[qcp]c).@xcite isothermal field dependences of the longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance and the hall coefficient show a crossover at a characteristic field @xmath101 that coincides with @xmath100 only in the zero - temperature limit.@xcite the width of the crossover sharpens with decreasing temperature in a pure power - law fashion , resulting in a sharp step in the extrapolation to zero temperature , much like the situation in the tetragonal heavy fermion compound ybrh@xmath102si@xmath102.@xcite this extrapolated zero - temperature discontinuity in the transport properties was interpreted@xcite as kondo destruction.@xcite in simple terms , at a kondo destruction qcp the @xmath60 component of the itinerant electrons localizes and thus drops out of the fermi sea .",
    "this changes the fermi volume from `` large '' to `` small '' . as a consequence ,",
    "local moment order may occur . as low - dimensional spin fluctuations are needed in the formulation of the theory,@xcite it was considered unlikely that a kondo destruction qcp could appear in three - dimensional systems . in cubic ce@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath2 , the afm phase is isotropic@xcite and thus it seems plausible to consider it as three - dimensional system .",
    "the global phase diagram for afm heavy fermion compounds@xcite provides a way to think about the unexpected kondo destruction in this compound.@xcite in the region of small values of the magnetic frustration parameter @xmath4 , a transition from an antiferromagnet with small fermi surface to an antiferromagnet with large fermi surface is predicted .",
    "in fact , the kondo destruction qcp in ce@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath2 occurs at the critical magnetic field for the suppression of antiferromagnetism ( phase iii in fig.[phasediagrams]f ) , inside the putative afq ordered phase ( phase ii in fig.[phasediagrams]f ) .",
    "magnetic fields are likely to induce magnetic dipolar moments on top of the ordered quadrupolar moments.@xcite thus , it appears plausible that the kondo destruction qcp in ce@xmath0pd@xmath1si@xmath2 indeed separates to antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "interestingly , in cein@xmath0 the effective mass of heavy r - orbits observed in de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) experiments appears to diverge at a field of about 40 t that is well below the critical field of 61 t for the suppression of antiferromagnetism.@xcite the afm order is claimed to change its nature from itinerant to local moment at the same field ( 40t)@xcite and thus electrical transport signatures of a kondo destruction would be expected .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of large fields may complicate such analysis@xcite and a careful modeling of the background contribution may be needed .",
    "the quantum critical behaviour discussed above occurs at the border of or inside an afm ordered phase . according to the phase diagrams in figs.[phasediagrams ] and [ pressure ] ,",
    "magnetism is more readily suppressed by magnetic field or pressure than quadrupolar order . to the best of our knowledge , no evidence for quadrupolar quantum criticality has been provided to date in any ce - based heavy fermion compound .",

    "in this brief review , we have assembled information on ce - based cubic heavy fermion compounds that show low - lying , tunable phase transitions and are as such candidates to further explore heavy fermion quantum criticality in the three - dimensional limit .",

    "quadrupolar order appears only if the @xmath54 quartet is the ground state ( for at least one crystallographic site ) or if there is an important admixture ( due to strong @xmath59@xmath60 hybridization ) of the @xmath54 wave function in the ground state . among the systems reviewed here , cein@xmath0 is the only one with a single ( antiferromagnetic ) phase transition .",
    "all others show , in addition to a magnetic transition , a transition attributed to higer multipoles , typically to quadrupoles .    to explore the three - dimensional limit , systems that retain cubic symmetry down to zero temperature",
    "are needed .",
    "two of the compounds , ceag and ce@xmath0pd@xmath1ge@xmath2 , show structural transitions as the quadrupolar order sets in .",
    "interestingly , for both of them , this transition has been identified as ferroquadrupolar . by contrast , at none of the antiferroquadrupolar transitions a structural transition or distortion could be resolved .",
    "application of a magnetic field to a state with quadrupolar order typically induces magnetic dipolar order on top of the ordered quadrupolar moments . as a consequence ,",
    "the quadrupolar phase transition temperature acquires field dependence .",
    "this is seen for all examples discussed here as an initial enhancement of the quadrupolar ordering temperature with magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the field dependence of the quadrupolar ordering temperature is , in general , anisotropic with respect to the direction along which the magnetic field is applied ( usually the directions @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 $ ] of the cubic crystal structure are probed ) .",
    "this may , however , not be confused with a breaking of the cubic symmetry of the crystal lattice , which is preserved as long as no symmetry - lowering structural distortion occurs .",
    "pure magnetic dipolar order in cubic systems , on the other hand , is isotropic with respect to the field direction , as experimentally observed for cein@xmath0 with a @xmath58 ground state .",
    "this distinction may help to identify whether or not the magnetic order in a given material is intimately coupled to quadrupolar order .",
    "details on how the different ordered moments interact with each other and with the conduction electrons remain to be explored .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the insulating sister compounds of heavy fermion metals , fully - gapped kondo insulators , are all cubic .",
