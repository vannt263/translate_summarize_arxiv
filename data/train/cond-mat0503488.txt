    "many fluid systems , on cooling below their freezing points , decline to crystallize , at least on experimentally accessible time scales .",
    "the fluids instead become glasses , highly viscous liquids or amorphous solids that appear rigid , but that lack long range crystalline order . despite enormous experimental , theoretical , and simulational study , the nature of the glass transition remains unclear .",

    "our results are based on molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "orientational ordering in glass - forming liquids and other systems has been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "the work reported here differs from earlier studies in that we ( i ) compute orientation correlations that correspond to non - crystalline ordering , ( 2 ) perform wavelet decompositions of the orientation correlation density , and ( 3 ) determine the temporal evolution of fluctuations in orientational ordering .",
    "there are a variety of ways to characterize angular order around a given particle .",
    "for example , one can measure the bond angle distribution , the relative likelihood that the displacement vectors from the given atom to two neighboring atoms have a particular value@xcite .",
    "the bond angle distribution , which reflects an aspect of the three - particle distribution function @xmath15 , has recently been shown to be accessible to experimental measurement@xcite .",
    "steinhardt , et al.@xcite used a spherical harmonic decomposition of the near neighbors of a given particle , an idea referred back to the earlier work of frank@xcite .",
    "spherical harmonics are a complete set of functions over the sphere , so the angular distribution of ( for example ) an atom s nearest neighbors can always be expanded in spherical harmonics of their density .    to characterize an angular distribution",
    ", one chooses an atom of interest , and a set of other atoms whose angular distribution around the atom of interest is to be characterized .",
    "the unit vector @xmath16 from the atom of interest to each atom @xmath17 of the @xmath18 other atoms are generated .",
    "the lm@xmath19 spherical harmonic component @xmath7 of the @xmath16 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lm@xmath19 spherical harmonic , and in the spherical harmonic @xmath16 is represented by the polar angles @xmath22 .",
    "the polar angles refer to a choice of the angular origins . to eliminate the dependence of @xmath7 on this nonphysical feature , one forms spherical invariants @xmath23 that are independent of coordinate axes@xcite",
    ".    many prior treatments of particle orientations focused on a search for icosahedral , cubic , or other crystalline local ordering in the fluid , including local orderings that are not crystallographic because they do not lead to space - filling packings .",
    "partial crystalline orderings are characterized by particular values for some of the @xmath24 .",
    "for example , icosahedral order around a center leads to nonzero @xmath25 for @xmath26 while face - centered - cubic and body - centered - cubic clusters have @xmath27 for @xmath28 . as applied to liquids , the ensemble - average @xmath29 determined from simulation or elsewise",
    "are compared with the @xmath29 that would arise from ideal local order of one sort or another . for historical reasons ,",
    "prior work has largely been limited to @xmath30 for even @xmath31 .",
    "however , the @xmath24 are positive semidefinite , and fluctuations can certainly lead to non - zero values for any @xmath32 , so therefore it is inescapably the case that @xmath30 is nonzero for every @xmath31 .",
    "the spherical invariant @xmath24 is determined by the instantaneous particle positions , and is therefore a function of time and space : @xmath24 changes as particles that are initially nearby move or are replaced with other particles . at a given moment , @xmath24 also varies from atom to atom .",

    "wavelets@xcite provide via functional transformation a representation of a function @xmath38 .",
    "a wavelet transform @xmath39 of a function @xmath38 is obtained as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are wavelet parameters , the _ dilation _ and the _ translation _ , respectively , and where the @xmath43 are the basis vectors of the wavelet transformation .",
    "the @xmath39 are the wavelet components of the function @xmath38 .",
    "the basis vectors all follow from a single mother wavelet function @xmath44 via @xmath45 the effectiveness of the transform being determined by the choices of @xmath46 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42",
    ". one choice of dilation and transformation variables relies on binary decimation , namely @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 being a basic length and @xmath50 and @xmath51 being integers .",
    "the @xmath39 allow one to regenerate the original @xmath38 , namely @xmath52 here the integral ( which may actually be a sum ) covers all allowed @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the @xmath53 are the vector duals of the @xmath43 .",
    "wavelet transforms are superficially a generalization of fourier transforms , for which the basis vectors are the @xmath54 and the dual vectors are the same function @xmath55 . in most cases , for wavelet transforms the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 differ markedly .",
    "musical notation , now twelve centuries old , gives an early description of a continuous function using basic vectors  namely musical notes  that have local support , and that arise from translation and dilation . equations [ eq : transform]-[eq : transformback ] assign to the function being transformed a continuous index @xmath58 , but there is no mathematical restriction that @xmath58 be continuous .",
    "it is equally possible to apply wavelet transforms to a function @xmath59 that is labelled by a discrete index @xmath17 .",
    "wavelet and their transforms in general have a variety of important mathematical properties :    \\(i ) local support .",
    "the support of a function @xmath56 is the region over which it is nonzero .",

    "\\(iii ) on the other hand , most wavelet basis vectors are not antisymmetric or symmetric under @xmath61 . nor are they in general eigenfunctions of obvious differential operators . indeed , many wavelets only have a limited number of derivatives . in some wavelet families ,",
    "the @xmath62 are not orthogonal ; they are instead overcomplete ( though reconstruction is still possible ) .",
    "an extremely wide range of continuous and discrete wavelet transforms is known to exist .",
    "much of the published literature on wavelet transforms examines one - dimensional transforms . to apply transforms to a volume one must either construct novel three - dimensional transforms , or one must construct a three - dimensional transform as the outer product of a series of one - dimensional transforms .",
    "we followed the latter approach .",
    "space was divided into small volumes , a spherical harmonic density was computed for each volume , and discrete wavelet transforms were then performed .",
    "we applied the discrete haar@xcite wavelets , which act by applying to adjoining pairs of points a low - pass filter @xmath63 and a highpass filter @xmath64 .",
    "the filters act on an adjoining pair of points @xmath65 and @xmath66 as @xmath67 and @xmath68 the @xmath63 filter produces a smoothed value , and the @xmath64 filter acts as an edge detector .",
    "the transform is done iteratively , by applying further pairs of haar@xcite filters to the output of the @xmath63 filter from the previous iteration .",
    "successive iterations are sensitive to features extending over larger spatial domains . to perform a haar transform on a cubic array of points , one first applies the @xmath63 and @xmath64 filters to pairs of points along one axis .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath64 filters are then applied to pairs of @xmath69 blocks along the second axis , and then applied along the third axis to filtered @xmath70 plates along a third axis , so that , e.g. , @xmath71 while @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the value of @xmath58 at the triple labelled point @xmath74 . because fluids have no directional orientation , the various @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 filters should on thermal averaging give the same output .",
    "the wavelet decomposition is iterated by applying further cycles of @xmath63 and @xmath64 filters to the @xmath78 output from the prior iteration , so that after each level of decomposition the @xmath78 outcomes are averaged over a cubical volume with twice the linear extent .",
    "physically , the @xmath78 filter detects the uniformity in @xmath58 across a region , the @xmath75 filters are sensitive to surfaces bifurcating a region into zones with different values for @xmath58 , the @xmath79 filters are sensitive to lines where pairs of surfaces intersect , and the @xmath80 filter identifies vertices where trios of surfaces come together .",
    "the filters other than @xmath78 give signed output , so we computed averages such as @xmath81 .",

    "the potential was truncated : @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "the underlying molecular dynamics code is identical to that of our earlier paper@xcite : newton s equations of motion were integrated numerically using the calvo and sanz - serna fourth order method@xcite , applying standard approaches to minimize calculation time .",
    "our system is smaller ( @xmath98 as opposed to @xmath99 ) than the system of our previous paper@xcite .",

    "the density is the same as that of the previously - reported simulation : @xmath101 , where @xmath18 is the total number of particles and @xmath102 is the system volume , with @xmath103 .",
    "based on the range of known static correlations ( at @xmath104 , @xmath105 out to @xmath106 ) , the fluid studied here is weakly periodically confined , in the sense that the radial distribution shells around two particles can overlap twice , once in each of two opposite directions .",
    "we equilibrated our systems at temperatures 1.20 , 0.88 , 0.73 , 0.69 , 0.66 , 0.64 , 0.59 , and 0.56 .",
    "the intermediate temperatures were chosen to match ref .  .",
    "to equilibrate the system , we prepared an initial system at @xmath107 , equilibrated that system , and then cooled to new temperatures by rescaling the particle momentum by 0.1% every fifty time steps , a time step being 0.01 in natural units . on reaching the target temperature ,",
    "the system was equilibrated for 10,000 time steps while monitoring the average kinetic energy .",
    "if the energy drifted during the 10,000 equilibration steps , the system was brought again to the target temperature and re - equilibrated until the average kinetic energy finally remained near its desired target value .",
    "simulations at a given temperature were then run for at least 50,000 time steps .",
    "the generic radial distribution function @xmath100 ( which gives the normalized ( @xmath108 ) probability of finding any two atoms a distance @xmath88 apart ) and the specific radial distribution functions @xmath109 ( which give the probability of finding two particles of species @xmath17 and @xmath83 a distance @xmath88 apart ) were determined .",
    "the mean - square particle displacements , the @xmath110 , and the @xmath37 were then computed , taking the particles neighboring the particle of interest to be the particles in the first peak ( region where @xmath111 ) of @xmath100 , including @xmath112 .",
    "static correlation functions @xmath110 were evaluated using every particle as a center and repeating the calculation every fifty time steps .",
    "we examined a wavelet decomposition of several spherical harmonic component densities . in order to apply wavelet decompositions",

    "we examined two rules , namely @xmath113 and @xmath114 here the system is divided into cubelets having volumes @xmath115 , each containing @xmath116 atoms used as central particles for the evaluation of the @xmath32 centered on them , and @xmath117 is the root mean square deviation of the distribution of the @xmath118 .",
    "equation [ eq : rho1 ] gives the total deviation within @xmath115 of @xmath32 , while eq [ eq : rho2 ] gives the deviation as averaged over all the atoms within @xmath115 .",
    "further work here is based on eq [ eq : rho1 ] .",
    "finally , we examined a position - momentum time correlation function @xmath119 and a position - kinetic energy time correlation function @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the @xmath122-component of the momentum of the particle of interest , while @xmath123 , labels @xmath124 and @xmath125 refer to determinations on the same particle of interest at the indicated times , and the @xmath126 direction is taken to be the @xmath122-axis . for delay time @xmath127 ,",
    "both @xmath128 and @xmath129 must vanish , because equal - time position - momentum correlations can not exist in classical systems .",

    "one of us@xcite has assembled evidence indicating that the so - called neutral polymer slow mode observed in light scattering spectra of some but not other nondilute solutions of neutral polymers provides experimental evidence for kivelson s model . in comparing results here with the proposals of kivelson , et al . , it is important to note that nothing in the kivelson model relies on the growth - frustrated clusters being icosahedral .",
    "the non - space - filling septahedral ( @xmath309 ) ordering for which evidence is found here is entirely consistent with the kivelson model s demands for a growth - limited spatial structure ."
