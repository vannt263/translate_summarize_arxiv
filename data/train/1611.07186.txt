    "one of the key issues in the physical realization of quantum computing@xcite is the scalability , namely the ability of fabricating and coherently manipulating one or few qubits must be extended to an array of them .",
    "spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots serve as one of the most promising candidates for quantum computing , not only because of their long coherence time and high control fidelities,@xcite but also due to their prospect for scaling - up,@xcite thanks to the mature infrastructure of present - day semiconductor industry .",
    "various types of spin qubits are currently being pursued in laboratories worldwide , including the single - spin qubit being encoded in the spin up and down states of one electron,@xcite the singlet - triplet ( s - t ) qubit@xcite which employs two - electron singlet and triplet states as computational bases,@xcite the exchange - only qubit@xcite together with its variant , the resonant - exchange qubit,@xcite utilizing certain three - spin states in a triple - quantum - dot system , as well as the hybrid qubit@xcite which similarly uses three electrons but has them hosted by double quantum dots . over the past decade , the s - t qubit has received intense attention because it is the simplest type of spin qubit which can be manipulated efficiently by pure electrical means .",
    "the vast success achieved at its single - qubit level@xcite has encouraged researchers to go on to two s - t qubits , which require four quantum dots occupied by four electrons.@xcite devices with four or even more quantum dots can now be fabricated in the laboratory,@xcite and progresses have been made toward precise manipulation of two s - t qubits.@xcite nevertheless , coherent control of the collective multi - electron states has remained challenging .",
    "the microscopic theoretical studies of double quantum dots , in particular those from the molecular orbital theory,@xcite have played an important role in elucidating the physics of an s - t qubit . not only the energy spectra and exchange interaction of the s - t qubit have been investigated in detail for their dependences on the dimensions of the device and the external fields,@xcite the responses of the qubit to various types of noises are also extensively studied.@xcite however , the extensions of these studies to two s - t qubits involving four quantum dots are less well explored .",
    "protocols to perform entangling gates have been put forward for capacitively coupled s - t qubits,@xcite and the `` sweet spots '' on the energy spectra where the control is maximally immune to noises have been suggested.@xcite while the molecular - orbital - theoretic calculations similar to that of one s - t qubit have been carried out in many of these works , the two s - t qubits are always assumed to be quantum - mechanically `` well - separated '' , that is , the wave function of one s - t qubit is assumed to have no admixture of that from the other.@xcite this has lead to a substantial reduction of the dimensionality of the hilbert space and has greatly facilitated the calculations since the two s - t qubits are treated essentially separately and are only connected by a coulomb integral .    in this work we conduct a comprehensive theoretical study of the four - quantum - dot system via the molecular orbital theory . in particular , we allow for the cases in which the admixture between wave functions of the two s - t qubits can not be neglected .",
    "we find that the energy spectra , while being very similar to that of the simplified case in which the two s - t qubits are treated separately , show important features of mixing as the two s - t qubits become close .",
    "we show that the qubit states may be less well defined for certain parameters , and consequently the exchange interaction that is usually defined as the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states must be understood as an effective exchange interaction that can be derived from the hubbard parameters calculated microscopically .",
    "we further study the gate crosstalk , the situation in which the manipulation of one qubit inevitably affects the other idle one due to the admixture of electron wave functions between the two qubits .",
    "we find that while the gate crosstalk via this quantum channel is typically weak , it can be much pronounced when distance between the two qubits are small enough .",

    "the consequences of this difference shall be discussed later .    in this work",
    "we consider four electrons ( with two spin up and two spin down ) occupying the lateral four - quantum - dot system .",
    "since only the lowest energy levels for each dot are retained in the hund - mulliken approximation , the maximum occupancy for each dot is two .",
    "the four - electron wave function can be generically written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 creates an electron with spin @xmath36 at the @xmath37 dot , @xmath38 , @xmath39 labels different energy levels for the four - electron states , and @xmath40 describes a vacuum state .",
    "the four - electron hamiltonian of the problem can then be expressed in a hubbard - like form as is shown in the appendix as eq .  .",
    "there are 36 possibilities for the four electrons to occupy the lowest levels of four dots ( two spin up electrons see four possibilities and so are the two spin down electrons ) , therefore the hamiltonian under the bases eq .   is a @xmath41 matrix . in the hubbard form of the hamiltonian , the kinetic energy ( @xmath42 ) and coulomb repulsion ( @xmath43 )",
    "terms constitute the diagonal terms of the matrix and the hopping ( @xmath44 ) , spin super - exchange ( @xmath45 ) , pair - hopping ( @xmath46 ) and occupation - modulated hopping ( @xmath47 ) terms primarily contribute to the off - diagonal ones . in practice ,",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are evaluated by computing the overlaps of the corresponding wave functions , that is effectively replacing the creation operators in eq .   by the orthogonalized single - particle wave functions",
    "@xmath33 though @xmath48 defined in eqs .  .",
    "in other words , the parameters of the hamiltonian are calculated microscopically using the hund - mulliken wave functions .",
    "one can then use either the matrix form or the second quantized form of the hamiltonian to further study its physical properties , including the energy spectrum and the ( effective ) exchange interaction as we will discuss in the remainder of this paper .    in a previous work,@xcite",
    "this problem was treated in the case where the two pairs of double - quantum - dot systems are sufficiently far away from each other such that the hund - mulliken wave function for each s - t qubit does not involve components from the other one . in other words , in ref .",
    "only the coulomb repulsion between the second and third electron is considered , and hopping and exchange involving them are ignored .",
    "this has led to a dramatic simplification of the problem as the hilbert space can be block - diagonalized and the two s - t qubits can be treated essentially separately .",
    "in contrast , our work explicitly retains all interactions involving the second and third electrons and our hund - mulliken wave functions include contributions from all four electrons .",
    "in this section , we study the energy spectrum of the four - quantum - dot system described in the previous section . to begin with",
    ", we qualitatively describe the situation where the two s - t qubits are sufficiently far away such that the exchange interaction between them can be ignored , as that provides the first insight to the problem at hand . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian can be factorized into two parts describing the left ( `` l '' ) and right ( `` r '' ) s - t qubits respectively : @xmath49 , while the states relevant to quantum computation can be written as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , where the first entry in the ket indicates the state in the left s - t qubit and the second the right one . to facilitate the discussion",
    "we introduce the following notations describing a state of an s - t qubit : ( we took the left s - t qubit involving dots 1 and 2 as the example , but one can easily replace them by dots 3 and 4 as well . )",

    "[ fig:2](a ) shows the energy spectrum of three levels relevant to the manipulation of the s - t qubits out of the full spectrum , with @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) shows the components of the @xmath50 state and fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) those of the @xmath52 state as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) . in this case , the two pairs of double quantum dots are sufficiently far away that the result closely resembles the case in which they behave independently .",
    "we have also verified that for all @xmath61 the results are very similar to the case with two independent s - t qubits , but those results are not shown .",
    "we see that if both s - t qubits have zero detuning , i.e. all dots are leveled , the lowest energy state is the @xmath50 state , but it is very close to the other states , @xmath51 and @xmath52 as shown in the figure .",
    "( the @xmath53 state is not important for the manipulation of the left qubit thus is not shown here . )",
    "the @xmath50 state has mostly the @xmath62 character while the @xmath52 state almost 100% the @xmath63 character .",
    "detuning of the left qubit ( changing @xmath1 ) leads to a reduction in energy of the @xmath50 state and a increase of the portion of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) or @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) in its composition , while the @xmath52 state remain unchanged .",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath50 and @xmath52 states therefore gives the exchange interaction required to steer the left qubit , performing a rotation of the bloch vector around the @xmath3 axis of the bloch sphere .",
    "these are known results from previous literature.@xcite    the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) presents a zoomed - in view of the three levels near the zero detuning .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two levels @xmath51 and @xmath52 cross at @xmath68 and @xmath69 mev .",
    "the two crossings are actually very sharp avoided crossings , which are direct consequences of the interactions between the second and third electrons belonging to the left and right s - t qubit respectively . in particular",
    ", the spin super - exchange term results in a nonzero off - diagonal elements between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 state , and such avoided crossing is just a manifestation that the two s - t qubits are not infinitely far away . such avoided crossings are very sharp and only affect a small range of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "these are noted as yellow lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) .",
    "as the two s - t qubits become closer , the mixture of @xmath51 and @xmath52 states at certain detuning values becomes more pronounced .",
    "[ fig:2](d)-(f ) show a situation with @xmath70 .",
    "the first difference we notice between fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and ( d ) is that the curves are moved in entirety to the right in ( d ) compared to ( a ) .",
    "this is because as the two s - t qubits become closer , the coulomb repulsion imposed by the right qubit to the left qubit becomes stronger , which increases the tendency to have double occupancy in the leftmost dot ( the first dot ) . in other words ,",
    "some of the coulumb repulsion takes up the role of the detuning and now a weaker detuning is needed to achieve the same level of exchange interaction compared to the case in which the two s - t qubits are far away .",
    "however , the most important feature we notice from the inset of fig .  [ fig:2](d ) is that the avoided crossings between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states are now much more visible and are smoother , and the percentage of the expected qubit states in the actual admixture of @xmath50 or @xmath52 states are reduced .",
    "[ fig:2](e ) shows the composition of the @xmath50 state as a function of the detuning and the percentage of @xmath71 state for the small detuning regime are not decreased by much . on the contrary",
    ", the composition of the @xmath52 state has been appreciably changed . from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](f ) we notice that a new state , the @xmath72 state now enters the admixture as a result of the spin super - exchange between the second and third spins , and most importantly in the neighborhood of the avoided crossing @xmath63 and @xmath73 states are substantially mixed . since @xmath63 no longer dominates the state , one is unable to define an exchange interaction in the usual way of taking the energy difference between the state and the @xmath50 , leading to difficulties in understanding the manipulation of multi - quantum - dot systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](f ) we have masked the range where the portion of @xmath63 drops below 80% with two yellow rectangles , and one must exercise caution in defining the exchange interaction as the energy level splitting between the two states concerned .    overall the results of the energy spectra of the four dot systems show interesting features : when the two pairs are sufficiently far away , the results closely resemble that of two individual s - t qubits . on the other hand",
    "as they get closer the spin super - exchange between the second and third electrons introduces the @xmath72 state into the composition of the @xmath52 state , and mixes the @xmath63 and @xmath73 states near two points of the avoided crossing of energy spectra .",

    "the lateral four - quantum - dot system can be alternatively described by a heisenberg spin chain model , @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the spin operator for the electron occupying the @xmath85th dot , and @xmath86 the effective exchange interaction between electrons in the @xmath85th and @xmath39th dot .",

    ", we compare the effective exchange interaction @xmath90 to that calculated from the energy level differences , @xmath91 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:3](a ) shows @xmath90 and @xmath91 as functions of the detuning @xmath1 with fixed confinement energy and the location of the dots .",
    "the results for @xmath90 and @xmath91 agree reasonably well for small detuning ( @xmath92 ) , and they both show the correct trend : the exchange interaction is minimal when @xmath93 , and it increases when the left s - t qubit is detuned in both direction , either @xmath65 or @xmath67 . for larger absolute value of @xmath1 , @xmath90 tends to overestimate the exchange interaction , which is about 20% larger than @xmath91 at @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account of the fact that the manipulation of a s - t qubit is done at small detunings , i.e. the singlet state should not be dominated by @xmath95 or @xmath96 states , we conclude that both methods of calculating the exchange interaction agree within this range .",
    "figure  [ fig:3](b ) shows @xmath90 and @xmath91 as functions of the confinement energy @xmath78 with the detuning @xmath97 and the location of the dots fixed .",
    "both lines show clear trend that for larger @xmath78 ( corresponding to narrower dots and higher potential barriers in between ) the exchange interactions are smaller , while for smaller @xmath78 ( corresponding to wider dots and lower potential barriers ) the exchange interactions are larger .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 basically agree for dots that are sufficiently narrow , i.e. @xmath98 , but for wider dots @xmath90 becomes systematically larger than @xmath91 .",
    "we note that when the dots are wide and the potential barriers in between are low , the wave functions between the two dots are substantially mixed and the hund - mulliken approximation becomes less reliable .",
    "nevertheless , both curves show the same trend and the deviation between the two are not large , provided the fact that in realistic experiment the potential barriers between the dots are typically well defined .",
    "figure  [ fig:3](c ) shows @xmath90 and @xmath91 as functions of the half distance between the two dots within each s - t qubit , with the confinement energy @xmath99 fixed . for @xmath80 small , the two dots within each s - t qubit are close to each other and the exchange interaction , which is essentially the overlap of the electron wave functions in the two dots , are large .",
    "as @xmath80 is increased , the exchange interaction rapidly decrease .",
    "this trend has been clearly shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) .",
    "we again encounter a similar situation with the other panels that @xmath90 tends to overestimate than @xmath91 . however , an important message from this figure is that @xmath90 can be defined in a wider domain than @xmath91 . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath100 , the second and the third dots , which belongs to two s - t qubits respectively , becomes close enough to each other that the computational states no longer dominate the four electron wave functions , and the exchange interaction therefore can not be extracted as the energy difference between the two relevant states .",
    "this fact is signified in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) by a dashed vertical line at @xmath101 , beyond which @xmath91 is shown as the dashed line .",
    "nevertheless , we may still define the effective exchange interaction according to eq .  , and it turns out that it agrees well with the results of @xmath91 that would be obtained if one simply takes the energy difference .",
    "this fact means that the @xmath91 obtained from taking the energy difference between the two states relevant to quantum computation , even when they are admixtures of a set of states without being dominated by the desired computational states , can be regarded as the effective exchange interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig:3](d ) compares the variation of @xmath90 and @xmath91 as the distance between the s - t qubits @xmath0 is changed , with the confinement energy @xmath99 , the detuning @xmath97 and @xmath102 fixed . for @xmath82 sufficiently large , the two s - t qubits behave essentially independently , and both curves of the exchange interaction show little changes for @xmath103 as expected . as @xmath82 is reduced , the two s - t qubits become closer and that leads to an increase in the exchange interaction .",
    "the reason is as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] : the right s - t qubit imposes an additional coulomb repulsion to the left s - t qubit , and that has increased the portion of @xmath95 in the singlet state , which has effectively enhanced the exchange interaction . both curves show this trend as expected . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the two s - t qubits are so close to each other that again the computational states no longer dominate the actual four electron state .",
    "a vertical dashed line is drawn at this point and @xmath91 is marked as dashed line to the left of it .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath90 , albeit still overestimate a little , shows that one may still define effective exchange interactions in this situation .      in this section",
    "we discuss the gate crosstalk in the four - quantum - dot system , a situation in which when an individual qubit is being addressed , its adjacent qubits are affected even if they have been left alone .",
    "since the ability to manipulate a qubit without affecting others is fundamental to any quantum algorithm , the gate crosstalk is therefore a key obstacle to achieve scalable , fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "we classify the sources of the gate crosstalk arising in controlling the semiconductor quantum dot qubits into three channels . in the first channel ,",
    "the changes in gate voltages are distributed into different dots .",
    "of course , if one is addressing one particular dot with certain gate voltage , that voltage will have a major effect on the chemical potential of the electrons therein .",
    "nevertheless , the energy of electrons in adjacent dots may also be shifted and the linear combination of these energy changes together accounts for the gate voltage applied .",
    "since this is entirely electrostatic , we term this channel as the `` classical '' one .",
    "the phenomenon has been studied since the early development of quantum dot spin qubits and is well explained by the capacitance circuit model,@xcite which essentially keeps all the kinetic energy , zeeman and coulomb repulsion terms in the hamiltonian , namely terms in eqs .   and are retained.@xcite this effect can be straightforwardly compensated , for example , by using appropriate linear combinations of relevant gate voltages and we therefore will not cover this further in this work .",
    "another related channel is the capacitive interaction between the two s - t qubits .",
    "when one qubit is detuned in such a way that one of its quantum dots has been doubly occupied , the change in electrostatic interaction consequently shifts the exchange interaction on the other qubit .",
    "this effect has been the basis for most experimental realization of two - qubit gates,@xcite and can be very well quantified and controlled . in our work , we do not detune the qubits far enough to allow double occupancy so this effect can be ignored .",
    "moreover , we rule out the contribution to our results from this mechanism because while the detuning of one qubit is changed from negative to positive values , one accordingly expects a monotonic change of the exchange interaction of the other qubit , and that is not what we have seen in the results",
    ".    we will therefore focus on the `` quantum '' channel of the gate crosstalk , which stems completely from the overlap between the wave functions of the adjacent electrons belonging to different s - t qubits .",
    "this effect is expectedly much weaker than the classical channel but is more difficult to compensate .",
    "therefore one of the main purposes of this paper is to give a quantitative evaluation of the deteriorating effect of the quantum aspect of the gate crosstalk , which we refer to as simply the `` gate - crosstalk '' .",
    "we note that in previous works treating the four dot system as two separate pairs , the gate crosstalk is absent because there will be no change on the quantum state of a given s - t qubit when the other one is being manipulated . in our work , we take into account of all four electron states and we can capture the gate crosstalk accordingly .",
    "the gate crosstalk manifests itself as the change in the exchange interaction of a given s - t qubit which has been left alone while the other is being addressed .",
    "we expect that this effect will be minimal when the two s - t qubits are far away from each other , but will become more pronounced when they are close . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : exch ] , the usual way of defining the exchange interaction as the energy difference between the qubit levels becomes problematic when @xmath105 . nevertheless , the effective exchange interaction @xmath106 defined in eqs .   and has always been well - defined , and while @xmath106 tends to overestimate , they agree well in the parameter range where quantum computation is to be performed",
    ". we will therefore use @xmath106 to study the gate crosstalk .",

    "[ fig:4](c ) , @xmath107 not only depends on @xmath1 , but also depends weakly on @xmath16 , leading to a `` bending '' of the stripe showing the increase of the exchange interaction .",
    "in particular , as @xmath16 is changed from positively to negatively detuned , in order to maintain the same level of @xmath107 , @xmath1 must be detuned further toward the left ( negative side ) . similarly , as has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) , while @xmath110 depends mainly on @xmath16 , it also weakly depends on @xmath1 : as @xmath1 is detuned from negative to the positive direction , one must increase @xmath16 a little to maintain the same strength of @xmath110 .",
    "this gate crosstalk effect , albeit not strong , is clearly the consequence of the overlap between the electron wave functions in different s - t qubits .",
    "our calculations also show that for @xmath112 , this effect can be safely neglected , but as @xmath109 is reduced below 2 , the effect quickly becomes pronounced , as has been shown in fig .  [ fig:4](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "note that @xmath111 means that the second dot is even closer to the third dot than the first one , a situation that does not usually happen in experiments .",
    "our results therefore indicates that as long as the s - t qubits are fabricated at a distance which is greater than the distance between the two dots within one qubit , the `` quantum '' channel of the gate crosstalk is very small and can be safely ignored .",

    "in this paper , we have theoretically studied a lateral four - electron four - quantum - dot system constituting two s - t qubits , using molecular - orbital - theoretic methods .",
    "we have applied the hund - mulliken approximation to keep only the lowest levels in the four dots , but we have explicitly taken into account the admixture of electron wave functions in all dots .",
    "we have found that this mixing of wave functions causes interesting consequences on the energy spectrum , exchange interaction and the gate crosstalk of the system . to be specific , we have found that certain states in the energy spectrum are no longer dominated by the computational basis states as expected , when the two s - t qubits are sufficiently close . in this case , the exchange interaction can no longer be straightforwardly found by taking the energy differences between the two relevant levels . on the other hand , we have found that the effective exchange interaction , which is a combinational result of various hubbard parameters that can be calculated microscopically , agrees well with the exchange interaction calculated by taking energy differences where applicable .",
    "this suggests that the exchange interaction in the four - quantum - dot system should be understood in an effective sense .",
    "last but not least , we have studied the gate crosstalk in the system arising from the overlap between electron wave functions belonging to different qubits .",
    "we have found that while this effect is typically very weak , it can become more pronounced when the spacing between the qubits are similar to or even less than the distance between the double dots that constitute the qubit .",
    "our work provides theoretical insights on the manipulation of two s - t qubits on four - quantum - dot devices , which consequently contributes to the effort toward scalable , fault - tolerant quantum computation using spin qubits .",
    "in this appendix , we give a detailed derivation of the effective spin hamiltonian from its second - quantized hubbard - like form.@xcite this has previously been done for a four - quantum - dot system,@xcite but our results have subtle differences especially in regard to the occupation - modulated hopping , which we shall explain below .",
    "when the coulomb repulsion is sufficiently large , double occupancy is precluded , and the hamiltonian can have an effective form as@xcite @xmath119 where @xmath120 projects the hilbert space into that of the case in which all dots are singly occupied , @xmath121 is the projection operator for higher energy state , and @xmath122 is the ground state energy of hamiltonian .          here , the @xmath126 term ( and its hermitian conjugate ) refers to the process in which an electron hops from the @xmath127th site to the @xmath128th site and then back , while the @xmath129 term indicates the reverse . in ref .",
    ", the two processes have not been distinguished . in our work , we have to distinguish the two because as we will see immediately below , the energy change will be very different . the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
