    "multi - scale image processing techniques have been finding natural implementations in hierarchical pyramid / neural networks @xcite , cellular neural networks @xcite , ca - based models @xcite , including probabilistic cellular automata @xcite .",
    "cellular automata have also been adapted to serve as a model of certain functions of primary visual cortex @xcite .",
    "the fact that such applications of ca are concerned with input configurations of bounded size limits the usefulness of conventional ca complexity measures that do not take into account properties of individual cells ( e.  g. size of the basic neighborhood ) . for example , an arbitrary class of input configurations of bounded size can be recognized ( in the sense defined in section  [ sec : recognition ] ) by a cellular automaton in a single step of the computation by means of using a basic neighborhood of a large enough size to fully cover the area of the input configurations .",
    "obviously , this implementation is not the one preferred in computer vision and biological vision systems . instead",
    ", multilayered designs are utilized in a wide range of image processing algorithms @xcite , as well as in biological vision systems @xcite .",
    "what properties of the complexity measures of the visual systems result in efficiency of the multilayered approach ?",
    "what properties of bounded configuration classes make them efficiently recognizable by multilayered ca ? these are the two questions we address in this paper .",
    "one immediate explanation of a potentially faster performance of a multilayered structure is its straightforward parallelization guaranteed by functional independence of the cells of the same layer .",
    "this paper , however , shows that the speedup can be achieved even with a sequential model of computation .",
    "one of the complications of adapting a conventional ca to a real - life recognition application arises from the fact that the cells of a conventional ca have a fixed functionality at every step of the computation .",
    "while this property of ca is suitable for representation of hardware arrays of processing units @xcite , this is an artificial constraint for software implementations and for modelling of biological systems where neuron layers of different functionalities realize step - wise processing . to overcome this constraint , in section  [ sec : fdca ]",
    "we define a generalization of ca , a dynamic cellular automaton ( dca ) and its finite version , a finite dynamic cellular automaton ( fdca ) .",
    "dca is different from the structurally dynamic cellular automata introduced in @xcite in that the local map and basic neighborhood of dca are preprogrammed for each step of the computation , as opposed to being derived on - the - fly .",
    "the finiteness of fdca allows the definition of its complexity measure in terms of the complexity of realization of each cell .",
    "it is shown that a more detailed analysis of the complexity measure , than the one that involves input size only , is necessary to account for potential reduction of complexity via multilayered processing .",
    "such analysis is done with the use of the cardinality of the class of local configurations recognized which is treated as a characteristic of the partitioning of all possible local configurations that is induced by the local map .",
    "the conditions for the two - layered fdca to be preferred over one - layered fdca are derived .",
    "these conditions relate sizes of the basic neighborhoods , the size of the input configurations , the cardinality of the class of local configurations recognized ( section  [ sec : conditions ] ) .",
    "finally , a model of a common image filtering task satisfying these conditions is presented in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "the following definition of fdca is based on the definition in  @xcite .",
