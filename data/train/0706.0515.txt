    "for example , metallicity , density , and abundance pattern can be determined for various clouds that represent different parts of a galaxy and its surroundings .",
    "it is also possible to suggest , based on kinematics , whether it is statistically likely that a specific absorption system is produced primarily in the disk of a galaxy or in a halo @xcite . for a line of sight through a spiral galaxy ,",
    "some of the absorption components are likely to arise from the disk and others from the halo .",
    "@xcite suggest that the dominant region of absorption in a strong absorber is often produced in the disk of the galaxy , and that the outlying components are related to the halo .",
    "the mg0.1emii  @xmath4 doublet is of particular interest because of its relative strength , ease of detection , and association with star formation .",
    "the close proximity of the two members of the doublet ( separated by only 7   in the rest frame ) makes it more convenient to locate than multiplet metals such as iron .",

    "type ii supernovae enrich the ism with a large magnesium to iron ratio within the first billion years of the formation of a stellar population .",
    "iron is mostly generated in type ia supernovae , indicating that a system must have a longer history in order to develop a relatively large to ratio .",

    "strong absorbers are defined by @xmath5   , and have historically been interesting because of a direct correspondence to luminous galaxies @xcite . although the absorbing gas is patchier than once thought , it is still clear that the majority of strong absorbers arise within @xmath6  kpc of an @xmath7 galaxy @xcite . for",

    "the ensemble of profiles for lines of sight through 0.4 @xmath9 z @xmath9 1.4 galaxies have kinematics consistent with expectations for a representative mixture of disk and halo kinematics @xcite .",
    "spiral galaxies are expected to typically give rise to a blend of several strong components spanning 30 - 100  @xmath10 , and one or more `` satellite '' clouds beyond this velocity range .",
    "@xcite measured rotation curves and found that 4/5 absorbers had kinematics consistent with rotation in the same sense as the disk , though in some cases a thick disk or a halo rotating in the same sense was required .",
    "elliptical galaxies will tend to have components more uniformly spread over a typical velocity range of 100 - 300  @xmath10 .",
    "the kinematics and overall absorption strength are also influenced by asymmetries in the gas caused by interactions and mergers @xcite .",
    "our goal is to determine the evolution of the kinematics of strong absorbers over the redshift range 0.3 @xmath9 z @xmath9 2.5 .",
    "this range covers about 7.7 gyrs of cosmic history , from 2.7  gyrs to 10.4  gyrs after the big bang , assuming @xmath11  @xmath10mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we divide this period into two halves , primarily based on the cutoff in the study by @xcite ( hereafter cv01 ) .",
    "0.3 @xmath9 z @xmath9 1.2 is referred to as our low redshift range , and 1.2 @xmath9 z @xmath9 2.5 as our high redshift range .",
    "these redshift ranges are of particular interest for galaxy evolution because several influential factors are known to change over this time period .",
    "first , galaxy morphologies tend to be more irregular at high redshift .",
    "@xcite found that large diffuse star - forming objects , suggested to be the predecessors of spiral disks are found primarily at 1 @xmath9 z @xmath9 2 , while asymmetric star - forming objects ( perhaps mergers that produce ellipticals ) peak in abundance at @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a predominance of `` chain '' and `` clump - cluster '' galaxies among the fainter magnitudes in the hubble ultra deep field while traditional spirals and ellipticals dominated among the brightest galaxies at low redshift .",
    "the second ( and related ) factor is the evolution in the galaxy merger rate , which dramatically increases with increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "the third factor , evolution in the extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) , can dramatically influence absorption line systems because it leads to a shift in the ionization balance of the various metal - line transitions .",
    "the ebr has been modeled as the cumulative radiation from quasars and star - forming galaxies , modulated by the forest @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the ebr is expected to be relatively constant , with a number density of ionizing photons @xmath16  @xmath17 , over most of our high redshift range , down to @xmath18 , but then decreases by nearly an order of magnitude to @xmath19  @xmath17 from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the last factor is the evolution of the global star formation rate in galaxies .",
    "this rate is relatively constant from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , then decreases significantly to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the peak epoch of star formation occurs earlier for giant galaxies than for dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we expect @xmath25-enhanced metal build - up for the first billion years past the birth of a stellar population , and an increase in the ratio of iron to magnesium subsequently due to contributions from type ia supernovae .",
    "cv01 studies the kinematics of 23 strong systems in the redshift range 0.4 @xmath26 1.2 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the hires spectrograph with a resolution of @xmath27  @xmath10 .",
    "when possible , and for these systems are compared to the .",
    "the authors found that strong absorbers are typically not characterized by multiple subsystems of comparable equivalent width or kinematic spread , but instead have a dominant subsystem , often with subsystems of significantly smaller equivalent width .",
    "it is important to note , however , that there are a wide variety of kinematic profiles within the cv01 sample . among systems with the same equivalent width",
    ", they found some cases with weak components widely spread in velocity and others with a single , saturated component .",
    "they also noted the interesting trend for systems with multiple subsystems to have the intermediate and high ( @xmath2840  @xmath10 ) velocity subsystems located either all redward or all blueward of the dominant subsystem .",
    "they interpreted this to mean that the dominant subsystem is related to a rotating disk that is systematically offset in velocity from the halo material that produces weaker subsystems . within the redshift range ,",
    "0.4 @xmath29 1.2 , there was no significant evolution in system or subsystem properties .",
    "cv01 compares the smaller subsystems at intermediate and high velocities to both single cloud , weak absorbers , and galactic high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) . in order to make a quantitative comparison , a slope was fit to the observed equivalent width distributions of these `` satellite clouds '' and the single cloud , weak absorbers @xcite . because of the large errors in the fit for the subsystems of the strong absorbers ( see figure  8a from cv01 )",
    ", they can not distinguish between the slopes for the two samples .",
    "however , @xcite does not find a turnoff in the equivalent width distribution of weak absorbers , complete down to @xmath30 = 0.02   .",
    "the equivalent width distribution of the weak subsystems in cv01 have a turnoff at @xmath30 = 0.08   , well above the drop in completeness , indicating a fundamental difference between the two samples .",
    "galactic hvcs refer to clouds with velocities @xmath31  @xmath10 relative to material in the milky way disk along the same line of sight @xcite . located in the galaxy and its surroundings , they are likely to have a variety of origins , ranging from a  galactic fountain \" , to accretion of dwarf galaxies and tidal debris , to infalling filaments and sheets from large - scale structure ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the satellites of strong absorbers have column densities less than the detection threshold of 21-cm surveys for hvcs , which led cv01 to conclude they are not analogous . however , hvcs cover a larger fraction of the sky ( @xmath32-@xmath33% ; @xcite ) than 21-cm hvcs ( @xmath34% ; @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that some of the hvcs have lower column densities .",
    "also , low ionization stages are detected in a separate phase at the same velocities with most of the milky way hvcs @xcite .",
    "thus , it now seems plausible that the satellite clouds of some absorbers are analogs to some types of milky way hvcs .    the strongest absorbers , those with @xmath35   may be produced by different physical processes than the typical strong absorber .",
    "using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and high resolution keck spectra , @xcite studied the evolution of this population , considering both its cross section for absorption and the kinematic structure of the profiles .",
    "they hypothesize that the decline of the incidence of @xmath35   absorbers at @xmath36 is consistent with the decline in the global star formation rate , and suggest a large contribution of galactic superwinds in shaping the kinematics of the profiles of these systems .",
    "@xcite came to similar conclusions based on a study of the sdss data .    in this paper , we present 33 strong absorbers in the redshift range @xmath1 observed with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "we will quantify the absorption systems with the same statistics as cv01 in order to make a fair comparison .",
    "our goal is to describe the kinematics of high redshift strong absorbers and to infer any possible evolution .    in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we present the quasar observations , the reduction of the spectra , and the absorber detection process .",

    "we describe each system in detail in   [ sec : systems ] .",

    "[ sec : summary ] is a summary of our results . ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is our discussion of the nature of strong absorbers and their evolution .",
    "we obtained 20 high quality uves / vlt qso spectra from the eso archive .",
    "the quasar names are provided in table  [ tab : tab1 ] along with v magnitude , quasar emission redshift ( from simbad ) , and the wavelength range of the uves spectrum .",
    "this same set of spectra was used for an analysis of the flux power spectrum of the forest @xcite .",
    "coverage breaks exist at about 5723 ",
    "5841   and 8520  8665   in all of these spectra . also present in all spectra were telluric absorption features .",
    "these absorption features can make detection of the weakest subsystems difficult .",
    "however , we address this difficulty in our discussion of each absorber (   [ sec : systems ] ) .",
    "the resolution is @xmath37 , or @xmath27",
    "@xmath10 ( the same resolution as in cv01 ) .",
    "the signal to noise of the uves / vlt spectra is high ( @xmath38@xmath39 per pixel ) .",
    "the cv01 signal to noise values tend to fall in the lower half of this range .",
    "we take this into account in our analysis , and consider possible biases when relevant .",
    "the data reduction procedure can be found in @xcite , and the procedure for continuum fitting is described in @xcite .",
    "our quasar sample was originally selected for a study of the properties of forest clouds @xcite .",
    "the criteria for selection from the archive for that study included high @xmath40 and large wavelength coverage .",
    "the result should be a relatively unbiased distribution of strong absorbers .",
    "however , the study also avoided quasars that had known @xmath41 dlas , based upon prior low resolution spectra .",
    "this will introduce a small bias , but we quantify the effect in   [ sec : equivalentwidth ] by comparing the equivalent width distribution of our sample of strong absorbers to the unbiased distribution obtained from a survey of sloan quasars @xcite .",
    "we searched the normalized spectra for mg0.1emii  @xmath4 doublets and found strong systems along 14 of the lines of sight ( the list of all lines of sight surveyed can be found in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "we would have excluded associated systems ( within @xmath42  @xmath10 of the quasar redshift ) from our sample , but in fact did not find any . although we used a @xmath43 search criterion for the  @xmath32796 , strong absorbers substantially exceed this threshold in spectra of this quality . because of the high @xmath40 of the spectra , in the process of the search we also detected the weak systems from @xcite .",
    "while these systems are not of particular interest in this study , our ability to find weak absorbers is relevant because the equivalent width of some individual components corresponding to strong absorbers is comparable to that of weak systems . after detecting the mg0.1emii  @xmath4",
    ", we also searched the expected locations of  @xmath32344 , @xmath32374 , @xmath32383 , @xmath32587 , @xmath32600 and  @xmath32853 .",
    "the transitions can be used to better understand the kinematics of systems with saturation in the profiles , and to constrain ionization conditions and abundance pattern .",
    "the  @xmath32853 transition was studied for the same reasons , and also to provide insight into properties of the lowest ionization state .",
    "many other transitions were also detected but are not included in this paper .",
    "for example ,  @xmath31260 and  @xmath31335 were not included because they are generally detected in the forest , making their kinematics more difficult to interpret .",
    "higher ionization transitions and lyman series lines were also detected for many of these systems , and they will be used to place constraints on the physical properties of the systems in future work .      a significant fraction of the strong absorption systems are comprised of more than just a single component .",
    "thus , we define subsystems using the definition from cv01 , `` absorption features that are separated by more than 3 pixels ( i.e. , a resolution element ) of continuum flux . ''",
    "we define these subsystems in order to examine the kinematics of each system on the smallest scale so that we may extract the most information possible from the systems .",
    "the subsystems are defined by their absorption in the  @xmath32796 transition , which must be matched in the  @xmath32803 transition .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each subsystem is determined by the wavelength on either side of the subsystem at which the equivalent width in that pixel returns to within @xmath44 of the continuum value .",
    "this definition assures that features between subsystems and noise in the spectra do not affect our interpretation of kinematics .",
    "cv01 applies a uniform sensitivity cutoff for subsystems with @xmath45 .",
    "although our sample is complete to a better sensitivity , we adhere to this less sensitive cutoff in order to make a fair comparison ( see   [ sec : subsysprop ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : tab2 ] shows that although two absorbers approach this limit ( subsystem 2 in the @xmath46 system toward q0122 - 380 and subsystem 2 in the @xmath47 system toward q0453 - 423 ) , none are below it .",
    "therefore , we have no need to adjust the sample due to this cutoff .",
    "cv01 also exclude any high velocity material above @xmath48  @xmath10 .",
    "our sample does not include any subsystems at such high velocity ; thus , we do not exclude any subsystems based on this criterion .",
    "we mention these cutoffs for completeness .",
    "we use several quantities to compare the shapes of the profiles of the systems .",
    "we formally define the redshift of a system by the optical depth weighted mean of the  @xmath32796 profile . the specific expression used to calculate redshift , as well as",
    "formal definitions of equivalent width , subsystem velocity , apparent column density , and velocity width , are given in appendix a of cv01 .",
    "all of these quantities are used here , but the velocity width , also known as the kinematic spread , is quite important for this study and thus deserves further comment .",
    "the kinematic spread of a system is an optical depth weighted average of the second moment of velocity .",
    "the combination of a system s kinematic spread and its equivalent width gives physical insight into the nature of the system .",
    "there is a maximum possible equivalent width for any kinematic spread , produced by a fully saturated , `` square '' profile . while there is no distinct opposite to these `` square profile systems '' , there are profiles with high kinematic spread and low equivalent widths .",
    "these systems generally have very few or no pixels saturated and consist of multiple subsystems with a large kinematic spread .",
    "we divide the systems into two redshift regimes , 0.3 @xmath9 z @xmath9 1.2 ( low redshift ) and 1.2 @xmath9 z @xmath9 2.5 ( high redshift ) .",
    "we use the low redshift regime for comparison to the cv01 data , and then combine those samples for comparison to the high redshift sample . here",
    "we present a short description of each strong absorber in the uves / vlt sample .",
    "descriptions of the cv01 absorbers were given in ",
    "3.3 of that paper . in figures  [ fig : fig1]ag we show the  @xmath32796 ,  @xmath32803 ,  @xmath32344 ,  @xmath32374 ,  @xmath32383 ,  @xmath32587 ,  @xmath32600 , and  @xmath32853 transitions for each system if they are covered by the spectra .",
    "table  [ tab : tab2 ] lists each system with its kinematic spread , rest frame equivalent width of  @xmath32796 , and its doublet ratio , @xmath49 .",

    "weak  @xmath32853 absorption is detected in the two strongest components of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1b ] shows that there is no true `` dominant subsystem '' in this absorber .",
    "the two subsystems have roughly equal equivalent widths ( the blueward subsystem has @xmath52   and the redder component has @xmath53   ) .",
    "there is a small feature between the two subsystems in both the  @xmath32796 and the  @xmath32803 .",
    "however , the  @xmath32803 equivalent width is greater , which is unphysical .",
    "consequently , we exclude this region when calculating the kinematics of this system .",
    "if there is any real absorption at this velocity , the paucity of the is such that it would have no significant impact on the system kinematics .",
    "is detected in both subsystems , but it is stronger in the redward one .",
    "two other features are apparent in the  @xmath32796 velocity window redward of the system .",
    "neither is confirmed by  @xmath32803 in a clean region of the spectrum , thus they can be cleanly rejected as absorption .",
    "a feature blueward of the system in the  @xmath32803 velocity window has no corresponding detection in  @xmath32796 .",
    "this unique system consists of multiple absorption features spread out over a velocity range of @xmath55  @xmath10 with no apparent saturation ; its profile is shown in figure [ fig : fig1c ] .",
    "generally , systems with such large velocity spreads do exhibit saturation .",
    "it is unusual in its large number of relatively weak separated comonents over such a large velocity spread . in most systems , one subsystem can be classified as dominant because it produces a great majority of the equivalent width ; in this system , none of the three subsystems is significantly stronger than all of the rest .",
    "the bluest subsystem consists of five components , and the central velocity and red subsystems each consist of two components",
    ". the  @xmath32853 transition is severely contaminated by a blend , particularly to the blue , but useful limits may be obtained toward the red . is detected in several transitions for all three subsystems , though  @xmath32587 and @xmath32600 suffer from blends due to telluric absorption .",

    "they found an oxygen abundance of @xmath58 solar , and a particularly low nitrogen content , suggesting recent star formation .",
    "they note that the large kinematic spread is suggestive of an ongoing merger that has triggered recent star formation .",
    "this extremely strong absorber is one of the two strongest in our sample and has absorption over more than @xmath60  @xmath10 and is fully saturated in the range @xmath61  @xmath10 to @xmath62  @xmath10 , except for a small break at @xmath63  @xmath10 .",

    "this is an indication of the tendency for high redshift systems to be more likely to have weak components connecting the stronger absorbing regions .",
    "we note that this result is not significantly affected by bias due to the higher signal to noise of the vlt / uves data .",
    "this is because nearly all absorbed pixels in all of the spectra have strong enough absorption to be detected even in the noisiest spectrum .",
    "we can also compare the observed distributions of absorbed pixel fraction for the high and low redshift samples .",
    "however , because of the tendency to have a large number of values of absorbed pixel fraction equal to 1 , the k - s test is not expected to be very sensitive to differences , and we apply the anderson - darling test .",
    "while the k - s test is most sensitive to differences near the center of the distribution , the anderson - darling test gives more weight to the tails .",
    "we first compare the absorbed pixel fractions of the vlt / uves low redshift sample and the cv01 low redshift sample .",

    "figure [ fig : subsysplots]a shows the cumulative distribution of the @xmath43 rest frame equivalent width detection limit at the position of  @xmath32796 for our absorbers .",
    "this plot is indicative of how sensitive our survey is to the weakest subsystems , which are likely to be single , unresolved components .",
    "our spectra have the same resolution as those of cv01 ; however , because our signal to noise is typically higher and because of the higher redshift of our sample , we have a significantly better rest - frame detection sensitivity . while cv01 is 100% complete down to 0.017   , our sample is 100% complete down to 0.0087   .",
    "our increased sensitivity indicates that we are able to detect weaker subsystems more easily than cv01 . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : subsystems ] , none of our subsystems are below the 90% cutoff of cv01 at @xmath184 .    figure  [ fig : subsysplots]b displays the equivalent width distribution of intermediate and high ( @xmath185 @xmath10 ) velocity subsystems .",
    "cv01 compare their data to a power law distribution and identify a turnover at @xmath30 @xmath90 0.08   .",
    "our data , for @xmath186   are consistent with the same power law , @xmath187 , as shown in figure  [ fig : subsysplots]b , and also with the turnover , although we are not as sensitive due to our smaller number of detected subsystems .",
    "cv01 also compare their turnover with that of weak absorbers ( @xmath188   ) at @xmath189   .",
    "these turnovers indicate that these two classes of absorbers are different .    in   [ sec : discussion ]",
    ", we will compare the distribution of equivalent widths for intermediate and high velocity subsystems to the distribution of equivalent widths of weak absorbers , and consider implications .    in figure",
    "[ fig : subsys ] , we plot the number of subsystems per absorber versus systemic redshift .",
    "the mean of the number of low redshift subsystems ( including vlt / uves and cv01 data ) is 1.86 ; the mean of the number of high redshift subsystems is 1.43 . because the data are in the form of only five integer values , neither the k - s or the anderson - darling test gives meaningful results .",
    "instead , we simply focus on the fraction of the systems that have more than one subsystem , @xmath190 in the high redshift sample , and @xmath181 in the low redshift sample ( vlt and cv01 ) .",
    "if , using bootstrapping techniques , we repeatedly draw at random @xmath191 values from the @xmath192 values in the low redshift sample , we find only a 5.6% chance of finding @xmath190 or fewer systems with @xmath193 or more subsystems . we thus conclude that the high redshift sample differs from the low redshift sample in the sense that systems at high redshift have a smaller number of subsystems .",
    "this is closely related to the result of comparing the fraction of absorbing pixels in the high and low redshift samples , in figure  [ fig : kinematics]d , since the two statistics are similarly defined .",
    "the number of subsystems per absorber is sensitive to the signal to noise of the spectrum .",
    "thus we conducted a simulation to consider whether the higher signal to noise in our high redshift sample leads to the tendency to have a smaller number of subsystems per absorber at high redshift .",
    "we added noise to each high redshift system , at a level comparable to the lowest quartile of the noise distribution for low redshift systems , @xmath194 per pixel . only a few high redshift systems ( the @xmath126 system toward he0940 - 1050 , the @xmath195 system toward q0453 - 423 , and the @xmath196 system toward pks0237 - 23 ) split into more subsystems even at this relatively high level of noise .",
    "taking into account the noise distribution for the low redshift sample , we estimate that statistically 0.5 - 1 more high redshift systems would have two or more subsystems .",
    "increasing that number by 1 so that @xmath197 of the high redshift systems have two or more subsystems still leads to an 11% chance that the high and low redshift samples are different in this sense .",
    "figure [ fig : naod ] consists of four plots showing different relationships for the apparent column densities of intermediate ( @xmath198  @xmath10 ) and high velocity ( @xmath199  @xmath10 ) subsystems .",
    "the apparent column densities were computed using the apparent optical depth method @xcite , as was described in appendix a of cv01 .",
    "the column densities of , , and as well as velocity ranges for each system are presented in table  [ tab : tab5 ] .",
    "a _ of figure  [ fig : naod ] shows the column density of for each of these subsystems versus the subsystem s centroid velocity .",
    "cv01 found that subsystem column density decreases with increasing subsystem velocity .",
    "this trend is also visible in both of the vlt / uves samples , with no apparent difference between the low and high redshift samples .",
    "finally , cv01 found a paucity of subsystems with @xmath200  @xmath57 , despite the fact the they were complete to a lower limit than that for many of their quasars . because the sensitivity of the vlt / uves sample is better ( complete to at least @xmath201 in all quasars , with much better sensitivities in most ) , we are able to test this claim .",
    "we also find no subsystems with @xmath202 , supporting the existence of a physical mechanism that prohibits subsystems weaker than this .",
    "this is directly related to the equivalent width turnover described in   [ sec : subsysprop ] .    in panels",
    "_ b _ and _ c _ of figure  [ fig : naod ] , we plot the logarithmic ratio of @xmath203 to @xmath204 as a function of subsystem velocity and @xmath205 .",
    "these plots are closely related , because large velocity subsystems tend to have small @xmath205 , as seen in panel _",
    "there is a large spread of @xmath206 , with values ranging from @xmath207 to @xmath208 .",
    "cv01 noted that many of the smallest @xmath209 values occur for subsystems with small @xmath210 , which include many of the highest velocity subsystems .",
    "the vlt / uves sample does not have any subsystems with such small @xmath209 values , either for weak or for strong subsystems .",
    "we note , however , that there are not enough medium and high velocity subsystems to consider in the vlt / uves data because it contains a significant fraction of high redshift absorbers , which tend not to have as many subsystems ( see   [ sec : subsysprop ] ) .",
    "thus , we can neither refute or confirm the interesting suggestion of cv01 that some of the highest velocity subsystems are preferentially @xmath25-enhanced .    in panel _",
    "d _ of figure  [ fig : naod ] we examine possible evolution in @xmath206 .",
    "this plot again illustrates the lack of subsystems at high @xmath152 , discussed in   [",
    "sec : subsysprop ] .",
    "while the high @xmath152 sample is roughly two - thirds the size of the low @xmath152 sample , it has only one - third the number of subsystems with @xmath211  @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the three highest redshift datapoints are not independent ; they are all subsystems of the @xmath212 system toward he0001 - 2340 .",
    "we note that for @xmath213 , there are no subsystems with @xmath214 .",
    "small @xmath206 values would signify either @xmath25-enhancement or a higher ionization parameter at low redshift .",
    "the latter is unlikely in view of the known evolution of the ebr ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath25-enhanced gas at low redshifts implies recent star formation in some fraction of the absorber population .",
    "the lack of such @xmath25-enhanced absorbers in the high redshift sample would be surprising but could be due to small number statistics .",
    "we repeatedly chose 10 subsystems ( the number in the high redshift sample ) at random from the full sample of 40 subsystems with @xmath211  @xmath10 , and found a probability of @xmath215 that there would be none with @xmath216 .",
    "figure [ fig : figure9 ] is a summary plot in which we show the , , and column densities ( from top to bottom ) of the subsystems of each system .",
    "the systems are displayed from left to right by increasing redshift and subsystems with different velocities are designated by different symbols .",
    "the small fraction of subsystems at @xmath217 with data is due to frequent contamination of that region of the spectrum by atmospheric absorption .",
    "there is no indication of evolution in @xmath204 , @xmath218 , or @xmath203 .",
    "here we summarize the results of our comparisons of the @xmath219 ( low redshift ) and @xmath168 ( high redshift ) strong absorber samples :    1 .",
    "we find no significant differences between rest - frame equivalent widths ( figure  [ fig : ewrest ] ) and kinematics ( figure  [ fig : kinematics ] ) for the vlt / uves low redshift sample and the low redshift sample of cv01 from keck / hires .",
    "this indicates that we can legitimately group these two samples together and compare to the high redshift sample from vlt / uves without concern about bias due to the different sample selection and instrumental configurations . 2 .",
    "the cumulative equivalent width distribution function for strong absorbers is statistically indistinguishable for the high and low redshift samples , as shown in figures  [ fig : ewrest ] and [ fig : zplots]a .",
    "this is consistent with the much larger survey of @xcite , who found no evolution for @xmath220   .",
    "the kinematic spread of strong absorbers also does not show significant evolution over the interval @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig : kinematics]a ) . at both low and high redshifts",
    "we see the full range of spreads , from saturated , single trough profiles , to those with many unsaturated components distributed over a large velocity range .",
    "4 .   the average number of separate subsystems in strong systems increases with decreasing redshift , from 1.43 at @xmath168 to 1.86 at @xmath169 ( see figure  [ fig : subsys ] ) .",
    "this difference is significant .",
    "the majority of the high redshift systems have only one subsystem .",
    "the small number of subsystems in strong systems at high redshift is not due to an absence of high velocity components , as evidenced by a lack of evolution in total system velocity spread ( see figure  [ fig : kinematics]d ) .",
    "instead , it is due to weak components `` filling '' the velocity space between the regions that would be separate subsystems at lower redshift .",
    "this leads to a larger fraction of absorbing pixels in high redshift systems ( shown in figure  [ fig : kinematics]c ) .",
    "we carefully consider whether the differences in the number of subsystems and in the fraction of absorbing pixels between high and low redshift could be due to larger contamination of the high redshift system profiles by atmospheric absorption .",
    "this possibility is ruled out after inspecting each doublet and finding matching absorption for weaker components ( those that `` fill in '' the velocity space ) in  @xmath32803 ( see figure  [ fig : fig1]ag and the system descriptions in   [ sec:1.6299 ] and   [ sec:1.7891 ] , where we note the two controversial cases ) . 7 .",
    "another way to understand the differences between the strong systems at high and low redshift is to visually examine the profiles in figure  [ fig : plot1alt ] .",
    "cv01 found that many profiles at low redshift have strong central components and one or more weaker , outlying intermediate or high velocity components .",
    "we also see some profiles like this at high redshift , but they are not as common . instead we see complex kinematics , with more components spanning roughly the same velocity range .",
    "the distribution of  @xmath32796 rest frame equivalent width for intermediate and high velocity subsystems is generally consistent with a @xmath221 power law , however there is a turnover , with few subsystems with @xmath222   , shown in figure  [ fig : subsysplots]a .",
    "this is not due to incompleteness , since our survey is 100% complete to a limit of @xmath223   .",
    "this confirms the results of cv01 .",
    "9 .   cv01 found that high velocity subsystems of @xmath169 strong absorbers tend to have smaller @xmath204 than low velocity subsystems .",
    "we find the same trend at @xmath168 ( see figure  [ fig : naod]a ) . 10 .",
    "there is no clear evolution in the ratio of apparent column densities of and for intermediate ( @xmath224  @xmath10 ) and high ( @xmath225  @xmath10 ) velocity subsystems ( figure  [ fig : naod ] ) .",
    "this is , however , hard to evaluate because of the smaller number of separate subsystems at high redshift .",
    "we see tentative evidence of @xmath25-enhanced gas in low redshift subsystems .",
    "we find that there is significant overlap in the kinematic properties of strong absorbers in the low ( @xmath169 ) and high ( @xmath168 ) redshift regimes .",
    "however , there is a systematic trend for high redshift systems to have weaker absorpting components connecting stronger regions of absorption .",
    "we expect that this indicates galactic structures at @xmath168 tend to have a larger number of _ accreting _ or _ outflowing _ clouds .",
    "in fact , we see very few high redshift examples of the classic disk / halo structures so common in the low redshift cv01 sample , evidenced by a dominant subsystem , with weaker subsystems to one side .",
    "the accreting or outflowing gas clouds are only evident in high resolution profiles , and because their absorption is so weak , do not produce an evolution in the equivalent width distribution of the population .    this evolutionary trend in the kinematics of strong absorbers",
    "may be the first systematic evidence for hierarchical structure formation seen in the gas .",
    "it thus provides a long - sought link to the volume of work on the evolution of galaxy morphology in deep imaging surveys .",
    "logically , this sort of evolution should be seen in the gas at high redshift , where images show that a large fraction of the solid angle around a luminous galaxy is covered by material .",
    "an extreme example of this is the `` spiderweb galaxy '' , a central cluster galaxy at @xmath226 , with many accreting , star forming companions @xcite . however , a large fraction of @xmath213 galaxies exhibit morphological peculiarities , including the `` clump - cluster '' morphologies @xcite that would give rise to the absorption signature that we find to be evident at those redshifts .    having made a connection between strong absorbers and structures seen in images , it is also important to consider possible connections with other types of absorbers .",
    "qualitatively , weak absorbers have absorption profiles similar to the weak outlying subsystems that are common in strong absorbers at @xmath169 . however , we noted in   [ sec : subsysprop ] that there is a significant difference between the equivalent width distributions of these two populations of absorbers .",
    "the weak absorbers have an equivalent width distribution that follows a power law , with @xmath221 down to @xmath189   , while the outlying subsystems show a turnover in this power law below @xmath227   .",
    "cv01 also saw this trend , and argued that there might not be a close connection between weak absorbers and outlying subsystems of strong absorbers .",
    "however , there have been significant new findings revealing more information about the location of weak absorbers relative to luminous galaxies .    through direct @xcite and indirect arguments",
    "@xcite it is now known that many weak absorbers are @xmath141-@xmath228  kpc from luminous galaxies , and not usually at larger distances as previously believed ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since",
    "weak absorbers are clustered around the hosts of strong absorption and since the two populations cover comparable fractions of the sky , this would argue that it would be common for a line of sight to pass through both a strong and a weak absorber .",
    "the difference in equivalent width distributions of the weak absorbers and the outlying subsystems of strong absorbers could be explained simply by stronger clustering of the higher equivalent width , weak absorbers ( those with @xmath229   ) around galaxies .",
    "the @xmath222   weak absorbers would then be at a larger separation from the galaxy , and it would thus be less probable to pass through such an absorber _ and _ through a galaxy .",
    "thus , it appears plausible that outlying subsystems of strong absorbers are produced by the same structures as weak absorbers .    based on photoionization models",
    ", @xcite found a similar multi - phase structure for weak absorbers as for milky way hvcs and concluded that they could have common origins .",
    "also , @xcite considered the observed cross - sections of high and low ionization systems at @xmath64 and concluded that a filametary or sheet - like geometry is favored for weak absorbers .",
    "this is consistent with the distribution of around the milky way @xcite .",
    "we have suggested that outlying subsystems of strong absorbers and weak absorbers may be produced by the same structures , and that weak absorbers and hvcs may be related .",
    "therefore , we should also directly compare subsystems of strong absorbers and hvcs . as described in   [ sec : intro ] , the hvcs that are detected in 21-cm surveys are only a subset of the population , with a larger fraction detected in absorption @xcite .",
    "in fact the kinematics of low ionization absorption detected looking out through the milky way ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) would be indistinguishable from those of some strong absorbers at @xmath169 .",
    "based upon all of these considerations , there is a compelling case for a three - way connection between outlying subsystems of strong absorbers , weak absorbers , and extragalactic analogs to hvcs .",
    "based on this connection , we can extend our interpretation of the evolution in the kinematics of strong absorbers .",
    "in this context , at high redshifts ( @xmath168 ) the structures that give rise to weak absorption and hvcs are present , but they appear more connected , by unsettled gas , to the strong absorbing structures .",
    "as we approach the current epoch , this gas settles into the weak / hvc regions , or more likely , into the strong absorbing region .    to test this idea , it will be important to make direct comparisons of the physical properties ( particularly metallicities and densities ) of weak absorbers and of the outlying subsystems of strong absorbers .",
    "this will require access to high resolution coverage of the lyman series lines associated with these absorbers , and to other key constraining transitions , such as and .",
    "this can be achieved with optical spectra for @xmath230 absorbers , but at such high redshifts high velocity subsystems are not common",
    ". to study the crucial low redshift regime , high resolution ultra - violet spectra will be essential .",
    "if the connection is real , we finally have a handle on the relationship between absorption signatures and familiar structures we see in the local universe and in deep imaging studies . with the tool of quasar absorption lines",
    ", we then have the ability to learn things about the gaseous assembly of galaxies that we can not learn from imaging alone .",
    "more specifically , through observations of the gas , we can study the relative importance of gas accretion and of major mergers in determining the evolution of galaxy morphology over the past @xmath231  gyrs .",
