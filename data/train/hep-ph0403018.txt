    "since 40 years huge experimental efforts have gone into the investigation of nuclear double beta decay which probably is the most sensitive way to look for ( total ) lepton number violation and probably the only way to decide the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "it has further perspectives to probe also other types of beyond standard model physics .",
    "this thorny way has been documented recently in some detail [ 33,69 ] .    the half - lives to explore lying , with the order of 10@xmath2years , in a range on half way to that of proton decay , the two main experimental problems were to achieve a sufficient amount of double beta emitter material ( source strength ) and to reduce the background in such experiment to an extremely low level . in both directions",
    "large progress has been made over the decades . while the first experiment using source as detector [ 59 ] ,",
    "had only grams of material to its disposal ( 10.6 g of caf@xmath3 ) , in the last years up to more than 10 kg of enriched emitter material have been used .",
    "simultaneously the background of the experiments has been reduced strongly over the last 40years .",
    "e.g. compared to the first germanium @xmath4 experiment [ 81 ] , working still with natural germanium , containing the double beta emitter @xmath5 only with 7.8% , 40years later the background in the experiment is reduced by a factor of 10@xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless experiments have to run over years to collect sufficient statistics and this led to other experimental challenges : stable data acquisition and calibration over long time periods ( more than a decade in the experiment ) .",
    "the final dream behind all these efforts was less to see a standard - model allowed second - order effect of the weak interaction in the nucleus - the two - neutrino - accompanied decay mode - which has been observed meanwhile for about 10 nuclei - to observe neutrinoless double beta decay , and with this a first hint of beyond standard model physics , yielding at the same time a solution of the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we describe how these challenges have been mastered in the experiment , which is running in the gran sasso underground laboratory since august 1990 , and which is now , together with the r. davis @xmath7 solar neutrino experiment [ 61 ] , the baksan neutrino scintillation telescope [ 62 ] which saw together with kamiokande and imb the first supernovae neutrinos [ 63,64 ] , kamiokande and superkamiokande [ 65 ] , gallex ( gno ) [ 66 ] and sage [ 66 ] , and dama [ 104 ] , one of the long - running underground experiments .    in our last publications [ 3,1,2 ]",
    "we presented an analysis of the data taken until may 2000 .",
    "since then we have taken three more years of data . in this paper",
    "we report the result of the measurements over the full period august 1990 until may 2003 .",
    "the better quality of the new data and of the present analysis , which has been improved in various respects , allowed us to significantly improve the investigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay process , and to deduce more stringent values of its parameters .",
