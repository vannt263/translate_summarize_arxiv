    "the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in hadronic collisions has been studied extensively since the born cross sections have been computed  @xcite . in particular , these processes allow to study the triple gauge boson couplings @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the study of these couplings",
    "is mainly motivated by the hope that some new physics may modify them .",
    "if the new physics occurs at an energy scale well above that being probed experimentally , it is possible to integrate it out .",
    "the result is an effective theory which might result in non standard triple gauge boson couplings .",
    "both collaborations at the tevatron have studied the production of @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite pairs .",
    "the bounds on the anomalous couplings obtained at the tevatron tend to be less constraining than those obtained at lep  @xcite .",
    "however it has to be kept in mind that these analyses are complementary . at the hadron",
    "colliders a whole range in the center of mass energy is tested , whereas at lep the center of mass energy is fixed by the collider . furthermore , with run  ii the expected number of events at the tevatron increases substantially . assuming a data sample of 2  fb@xmath10 , more than 3000 @xmath11 events and 700 @xmath12 events are expected for each experiment  @xcite .",
    "of course , the expected number of events is even bigger for the lhc .",
    "anomalous triple gauge boson couplings lead to deviations from standard model predictions .",
    "obviously , observables for which these deviations are enhanced offer better chances to find new physics or get tighter constraints on anomalous couplings .",
    "there are basically two classes of such observables .",
    "either we consider observables which are strongly suppressed in the standard model or observables with large transverse momentum ( or center of mass energy ) . in both cases ,",
    "the inclusion of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections is mandatory .",
    "a prominent example of an observable that is suppressed in the standard model is the so called radiation zero for @xmath0 production . at leading order ( lo ) there exist some kinematic configurations for which the amplitude vanishes  @xcite .",
    "this is manifest in some observables as a dip in the rapidity distributions .",
    "since anomalous coupling contributions fill in the dips , there seemed to be excellent prospects to obtain accurate limits for them from experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , next - to - leading order qcd corrections strongly affect the lo analysis .",
    "they have the same effect as the anomalous coupling contributions .",
    "the dips are filled in , making the extraction of anomalous couplings quite more difficult .    for processes with large transverse momentum or center of mass energy , the nlo corrections are particularly large .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cross sections in these cases get large contributions from gluon induced partonic subprocesses , which only enter in a next - to - leading order description of the cross section .",
    "thus , even though the anomalous contributions are enhanced in these regions , a calculation at nlo in @xmath2 is required to reliably exclude ( or establish ) physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the relevance of nlo corrections was first shown for the production of real ( spin - summed ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons with standard model couplings and without considering lepton decays and spin correlations @xcite .",
    "these calculations were later extended , in order to include the leptonic decays and anomalous couplings @xcite . however , the full one - loop amplitudes including leptonic decays became available only very recently @xcite .",
    "therefore , refs .",
    "@xcite included decay correlations everywhere except for the finite part of the virtual contributions .",
    "in this paper we present order @xmath2 results for the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in hadronic collisions , including the _ full _ leptonic correlations .",
    "we work in the narrow - width approximation , where only ` single - resonant ' feynman diagrams have to be considered .",
    "the simplicity of the helicity method allows to take into account anomalous couplings as well and present for the first time analytical expressions for the corresponding amplitudes .    for the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 production at hadron colliders , some results beyond the narrow - width approximation are known .",
    "the narrow - width approximation requires only the calculation of ` doubly - resonant ' feynman diagrams .",
    "however , for these processes , also the amplitudes including ` single - resonant ' diagrams have been computed and implemented into a monte carlo program  @xcite .    to perform the phase space integration we use the subtraction method discussed in ref .",
    "this allows for a straightforward implementation of the one - loop @xmath15 and bremsstrahlung @xmath16 amplitudes , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath17 .",
    "the constructed monte carlo code allows the computation of any infrared - safe observable .    a brief overview of the calculation is given in section 2 , were we summarize the input parameters used and the cuts implemented to obtain our phenomenological results . in section 3 we first present some benchmark cross section numbers for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at the lhc and study the typical scale dependence of some observables at nlo in the standard model . since",
    "many distributions have been studied in the past , we refrain from doing a detailed analysis . however , as soon as more precise data becomes available such an analysis can easily be done .    in section 4",
    "we concentrate on anomalous triple gauge boson couplings .",
    "we describe the parameterization of the triple gauge boson vertex in terms of anomalous coupling parameters and search for the kinematical region where its effect is amplified , namely at large transverse momentum for both photon and leptons .",
    "we also analyze the possibility of seeing the effect of approximate radiation zeros in the @xmath0 process , i.e. by looking for dips in rapidity distributions . in order to avoid the arbitrariness introduced by form factors , we propose to analyze the anomalous couplings as a function of the squared partonic center of mass energy @xmath18 .",
    "this has been suggested previously for the @xmath1 case  @xcite , where such an analysis is straightforward .",
    "we extend this idea to the @xmath0 production .",
    "this case is more involved , since a complete reconstruction of @xmath18 is impossible , due to the appearance of a non observed neutrino in the @xmath3 decay .",
    "particularly , we present an observable quantity which is highly correlated to @xmath18 and , therefore , allows such an analysis even for @xmath0 production . finally , in section 5 we give our conclusions and in the appendix we present analytical expressions for the amplitudes relevant for the processes under consideration .",
    "the helicity amplitudes needed for the computation of the nlo corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in the standard model were presented in ref .",
    "the amplitudes relevant for the inclusion of anomalous couplings are presented in the appendix . in order to cancel analytically the soft and collinear singularities coming from the bremsstrahlung and one loop parts ,",
    "we have used the version of the subtraction method presented in ref .",
    "the amplitudes are therefore implemented into a numerical monte carlo style program , which allows to calculate any infrared - safe physical quantity with arbitrary cuts .",
    "obviously , the monte carlo program can be used for the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "however , in this paper we will mainly concentrate on results for the lhc collider , which corresponds to @xmath19 scattering at @xmath20 tev .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the results are obtained using the following cuts : we make a transverse momentum cut of @xmath21  gev for the charged leptons and the rapidity is limited to @xmath22 for all detected particles .",
    "the photon transverse momentum cut is @xmath23  gev for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) production . for the @xmath0 case",
    "we require a minimum missing transverse momentum carried by the neutrinos @xmath24  gev . additionally , charged leptons and the photons",
    "must be separated in the rapidity - azimuthal angle by @xmath25 . moreover , since our calculation is done in the narrow - width approximation and , therefore , ignores the radiation of photons from the final state leptons , we apply an additional cut to suppress the contribution from the off - resonant diagrams . for that purpose",
    ", we require the transverse mass @xmath26  gev for @xmath0 production and the invariant mass of the @xmath27 system @xmath28  gev for the @xmath1 case .",
    "finally , photons can also be significantly produced at lhc from the _ fragmentation _ of a final state parton .",
    "unfortunately , fragmentation functions of partons into photons are not very well determined and the nlo calculation for such a contribution is not available yet . in principle , a full nlo calculation should include it however , since only the sum of the ` direct ' plus ` fragmentation ' components is physically well defined at nlo ( only in the sum all collinear singularities cancel out ) . in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", we include the lo component of the fragmentation part but using nlo fragmentation distributions , where we can factorize the final state @xmath29 collinear singularities .",
    "since the ` fragmentation ' component can be further suppressed implementing certain cuts ( see below ) the lack of its nlo calculation is not expected to affect the final result beyond the few percent level .",
    "the fragmentation contribution constitutes a background to the search of anomalous couplings , since it does not involve any triple gauge boson coupling .",
    "fortunately , there is a way to suppress its contribution by requiring the photons to be isolated from hadrons . in this paper",
    "we require the transverse hadronic momentum in a cone of size @xmath30 around the photon to be smaller than a small fraction of the transverse momentum of the photon @xmath31 this completes the definition of our standard cuts .",
    "when indicated , we also apply a jet - veto , which means that we reject any event where a jet of @xmath32  gev and @xmath33 is observed .    in our results we do not include the branching ratios of the vector boson into leptons .",
    "they can be taken into account by simply multiplying our final results with the corresponding branching ratio .",
    "for both the lo and nlo results we use the latest ( corrected ) set of parton distributions of mrst(cor01 ) @xcite and the two loop expression ( with @xmath34 for the typical scales of these processes ) for the strong coupling constant with @xmath35  mev which corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "for the fragmentation component we use the fragmentation functions from ref .",
    "@xcite .    since we are particularly interested in the large @xmath37 tail , which is more sensitive to the anomalous coupling contributions , we use ( unless otherwise stated ) @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{must}\\ ] ] as the standard scale for both the factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "contributions from @xmath39 and @xmath40 quark initial states have been neglected and , consistently , the following values have been used for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements in the case of @xmath0 production : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the masses of the vector bosons have been set to @xmath43  gev and @xmath44  gev .",
    "we do not include any qed or electroweak corrections but choose the coupling constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the spirit of the ` improved born approximation ' @xcite , with @xmath47 .",
    "notice that the observable is order @xmath48 ; within the same spirit we use the running @xmath49 for the coupling between the vector boson and the quarks ( to effectively take into account the ew corrections ) whereas we keep @xmath50 for the photon coupling .",
    "it is worth noticing that this modification results in a 7% change in the normalization of the cross section with respect to the standard approach of using both running coupling constants .",
    "we begin the presentation of our results with some total cross section numbers in table  [ tab : xstev ] , which can be useful for future checks and for an estimate of the number of events to be observed at the lhc .",
    "the first three results were obtained by imposing only the cut on the transverse momentum of the photon , i.e. @xmath51 gev for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) production .",
    "apparently , the nlo corrections as well as the fragmentation contribution are very large . as discussed above , the relative importance of the fragmentation contribution can be reduced substantially by applying the isolation cut prescription .",
    "this can be seen from the results for the total cross section obtained after the implementation of our standard cuts , which are also presented in table  [ tab : xstev ] .",
    "unfortunately , most of the previous publications on the subject @xcite do not present cross sections numbers .",
    "nevertheless , we have compared many of the plots shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , specially for the case of real ( spin - summed ) @xmath52 production @xcite ( which is not affected by lepton correlations ) . within the precision that can be reached in such a comparison",
    ", we found good agreement .",
    "0.2 cm    .cross sections in pb for @xmath19 collisions at @xmath53 tev for @xmath54 .",
    "the statistical errors are @xmath551 within the last digit .",
    "lo@xmath56 corresponds to the direct component only .",
    "[ tab : xstev ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in what follows we will estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our results by analyzing the variation of various distributions when changing the scale @xmath57 by a factor of two in both directions @xmath58 . since many observables already have been studied in the past  @xcite and in order to avoid the proliferation of plots , we refrain from presenting a detailed analysis here .",
    "we simply concentrate on a couple of typical examples in order to give a general picture and illustrate the importance of nlo corrections in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 production .    in figure",
    "[ fig : scalewy ] we show the scale dependence of the @xmath37 distribution of the photon in @xmath59 production with the standard cuts applied ( upper curves ) and also with the additional requirement of a jet - veto ( lower curves ) . as can be observed , the scale dependence is still large ( @xmath60 ) as long as only the standard cuts are applied .",
    "however , it is considerably reduced when the jet - veto is applied .",
    "the situation is similar to what has been observed in the case of @xmath61 production @xcite and is caused by the suppression of the contribution from the @xmath62 initial state appearing for the first time at nlo .",
    "since this initial state dominates the cross section , the nlo result behaves , regarding the scale dependence , effectively like a lo one .    in the inset plot",
    "we present the ratio between the nlo and lo results ( with the standard scale ) , which remains larger than 3 and increases with the photon transverse momentum .",
    "this clearly shows that the lo calculation is not even sufficient for an understanding of the shape of the distribution , since the nlo effect goes beyond a simple change in the normalization .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the relevance of the nlo corrections for this process is mainly due to the breaking of the radiation zero appearing at lo and to the large @xmath62 initial state parton luminosity at the lhc .",
    "we also show the ratio of the nlo jet - veto and the lo result . as expected , this ratio is closer to 1 , again due to the fact that most of the contributions coming from the new subprocesses appearing at nlo are suppressed by the jet - veto .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the scale dependence of the lo result turns out to be very small .",
    "this is an artificial effect and illustrates that a small scale dependence is by no means a guaranty for small nlo corrections .",
    "in fact , there is no renormalization scale dependence at all at lo .",
    "the only scale dependence comes from the factorization scale dependence of the parton distribution functions .",
    "furthermore , we would like to mention that the situation concerning the scale dependence is slightly more favorable at the tevatron .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the gluon initiated process is less important .    in figure",
    "[ fig : scalezy ] we study the lepton correlation in the azimuthal angle for @xmath1 production , @xmath63 .",
    "notice that this observable can be studied at nlo since we take fully into account the spin correlations between the leptons in our implementation of the one - loop corrections .",
    "the nlo corrections are rather sizeable and increase the cross section by @xmath64 for small @xmath65 .",
    "the region @xmath66 ( with our standard cuts ) is kinematically forbidden unless a jet with a high transverse momentum is produced .",
    "therefore , the cross section vanishes at lo and it is strongly suppressed for the nlo calculation with jet - veto . in this region ,",
    "the full nlo calculation is effectively only a lo calculation and its scale dependence becomes larger , as expected .    because there is no radiation zero appearing at lo for @xmath1 production , the nlo corrections are under better control in the kinematical region where the lo cross section does not vanish",
    "nevertheless , for large transverse momentum , the process with a @xmath62 initial state again dominates the nlo contribution and the corrections increase considerably @xcite .",
    "finally we mention that we also considered a more stringent photon isolation prescription , introduced by frixione @xcite .",
    "this prescription completely eliminates the fragmentation contribution .",
    "we have checked that the main features of all studied distributions remain unchanged when it is imposed .",
    "the study of triple gauge boson couplings is motivated by the hope that some physics beyond the standard model leads to a modification of these couplings which eventually could be detected . in order to quantify the effects of the new physics an effective lagrangian",
    "is introduced which in principle contains all lorentz invariant terms .",
    "the prefactor of these operators are the anomalous couplings .",
    "a general approach is impractical , since it would lead to a proliferation of new couplings .",
    "therefore , some additional constraints have to be imposed .",
    "the usual choice for @xmath0 production is to insist on electromagnetic gauge invariance and on @xmath67 and @xmath68 invariance .",
    "also , only operators of dimension six or less are considered .",
    "this leads to a momentum - space vertex @xmath69 ( where all momenta are outgoing @xmath70 ) which can be written as @xcite ^_w w ( q , , p ) & = & ^g^ ( 2 + ^+ ^ ) - q^g^ ( 2 + ^+ ^ ) + & & 1 cm + ( ^- q^ ) , [ wwyvertex ] where the overall coupling has been chosen to be @xmath71 .",
    "note that in the feynman rule for this vertex there is also a factor @xmath72 that is conventionally not included in @xmath73 . in the standard model we have @xmath74 .    for @xmath1 production",
    ", we consider operators up to dimension 8 ( all of them @xmath67 odd ) resulting in @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings .",
    "the non - standard @xmath75 momentum - space vertex is given by @xcite ^_z z(q_1 , q_2 , p ) = ( & & h_1^z ( q_2^g^ - q_2^g^ ) + p^ ( pq_2  g^ - q_2^p^ ) + & - & h_3^z ^ q_2 - ^ p^p_q_2 ) [ zzyvertex ] where the overall coupling has been chosen to be @xmath76 ( and @xmath77 ) .",
    "this vertex is absent altogether in the standard model .",
    "the non - standard @xmath78 momentum - space vertex can be obtained from by setting @xmath79 and replacing @xmath80 .",
    "notice that the vertex differs from the one implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite by an overall factor @xmath72 , which ensures the hermiticity of the corresponding effective lagrangian contributions coming from the different definition of @xmath81 in ref.@xcite ]  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath72 factor modifies the interference pattern of anomalous coupling and standard model amplitudes : @xmath82-violating @xmath83 contributions do not interfere with the standard model ones , whereas the @xmath82-conserving @xmath84 do @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the corrected vertex , there are contributions linear in @xmath84 and the cross section is generally not invariant anymore under a change of sign of @xmath84 .",
    "this must be considered in a future precise analysis of anomalous couplings from experimental data since the limits for @xmath84 will not be symmetric at variance with present analyses .",
    "the anomalous couplings spoil the gauge cancellation in the high energy limit and , therefore , will lead to violation of unitarity for increasing partonic center of mass energy @xmath85 .",
    "usually , in an analysis of anomalous couplings from experimental data in hadronic collisions this problem is circumvented by supplementing the anomalous couplings , @xmath86 , with form factors .",
    "a common choice for the form factor is _ ac [ formfac ] where @xmath87 has to be large enough to ensure unitarity and @xmath88 is interpreted as the scale for new physics .",
    "obviously , this procedure is rather ad hoc and introduces some arbitrariness @xcite .",
    "also , it is not really consistent with the effective theory approach .",
    "increasing anomalous contributions would require the inclusion of even higher dimensional operators .",
    "at the end of this section section we will address the question on how to avoid this arbitrariness in an analysis of anomalous couplings at hadron colliders .",
    "anomalous couplings mainly affect the events with large @xmath18 or large @xmath37 .",
    "since the total cross section is dominated by low @xmath37 events this is not a good observable to get tight constraints on anomalous couplings .",
    "a more promising possibility is to consider a double binned cross section .",
    "we therefore consider the total cross section binned in @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the process @xmath91 at the lhc . in figure",
    "[ fig : doubbinwy ] we show the ratio of @xmath92 over @xmath93 where @xmath93 is the standard model cross section and @xmath92 is the cross section obtained with @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( both within the present experimental limits from lep  @xcite and tevatron  @xcite ) and a form factor as defined in with @xmath96 and @xmath97  2  tev . as expected , the ratio is large for the high @xmath37 bins , whereas it is very close to one for the low @xmath37 bins .",
    "we checked that the uncertainty coming from the scale variation is much smaller than the effect of the anomalous couplings for the high @xmath37 bins .    another possibility to get",
    "a large effect due to anomalous couplings is to consider the approximate radiation zeros present in the @xmath0 process @xcite . at tree - level in the standard model",
    ", the @xmath98 distribution has a radiation zero .",
    "this dip is filled by next - to - leading order corrections and anomalous effects . in order to get an observable quantity ,",
    "we do not consider @xmath99 but rather @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this will wash out the dip as the rapidity of the lepton is not equal to the rapidity of the @xmath3 .",
    "however , requiring the energy ( or the transverse momentum ) of the lepton to be large enough forces the lepton to follow closely the @xmath3 direction .",
    "also , applying a jet - veto reduces the effects of the next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "thus , for larger @xmath89 even the next - to - leading order @xmath100 distribution shows a clear dip in the standard model .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : dipey ] , where we show the @xmath100 distribution for the standard cuts and the additional cuts @xmath101  gev and @xmath102  gev respectively . in all figures",
    "we apply our jet - veto .",
    "also shown are the three distributions with anomalous couplings , which are chosen as for figure  [ fig : doubbinwy ] .",
    "clearly , the effect is dramatic for high energy leptons but of course , the disadvantage of applying such a cut is a big loss in statistics .",
    "we now turn to the question whether it is possible to avoid using form factors in the analysis of anomalous couplings at hadron colliders .",
    "this would bring these analyses more into line with those at @xmath103 colliders . in order to do",
    "so one should analyze the data at fixed values of @xmath18 , as it is done at lep .",
    "this results in limits for the anomalous parameters which are a function of @xmath18 .    obviously , it is possible to do such analysis for the production of @xmath1 when both leptons are detected .",
    "since the center of mass partonic energy can be reconstructed from the kinematics of the final state particles the cross section can be measured for different bins of fixed @xmath18  @xcite . as an example , we show in figure  [ fig : anomzy ] the cross section as a function of @xmath18 . in order to enhance the effect of the anomalous couplings we do not only apply our standard cuts but we also require @xmath104  gev and @xmath105  gev .",
    "we show four curves : the curve ( a ) is the standard model result ; curve ( b ) includes anomalous couplings in the standard way , that is with a form factor as defined in with @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) for @xmath108 and @xmath109  tev and we have set @xmath110 ; curve ( c ) uses the same values for @xmath111 but does not include any form factor ; finally curve ( d ) does also not include any form factors but the anomalous couplings are smaller @xmath112 . for all of them we set @xmath113 . of course , for large @xmath18 the effects are much more dramatic if the form factor is omitted and at some point the corresponding curves would violate unitarity .",
    "this simply reflects the breakdown of the effective theory approach in this region .",
    "the idea behind figure  [ fig : anomzy ] is that such an analysis can be done for suitably defined bins in @xmath18 . as a result , for each bin , i.e. each value of @xmath18 a bound on the anomalous couplings can be obtained .    in the inset plot we present again curve ( b ) and the one corresponding to the parameters of ( b ) but with the opposite sign for values of the anomalous couplings @xmath114 . from there the effect of the interference between ac and sm results",
    "can be observed , i.e. the contribution of linear terms in @xmath115 and @xmath116 appearing in the squared amplitudes due to the correct treatment of the @xmath72 factor in the @xmath117 vertex @xcite . for this particular configuration ,",
    "the interference effects are mostly relevant at @xmath118 tev and modify the cross section by more than 10% .",
    "clearly , they must be taken into account in a precise extraction of anomalous couplings from future experimental data .",
    "results for @xmath119 couplings are similar to those obtained for the same values of @xmath120 .",
    "the only difference comes from the fact that the @xmath82-violating couplings do not interfere with the sm . for a configuration like ( b ) with @xmath121",
    ", the cross section is given by the average of both curves in the inset plot of figure  [ fig : anomzy ] .",
    "the situation is more complicated for @xmath0 production since the neutrino is not observed .",
    "nevertheless , by identifying the transverse momentum of the neutrino with the missing transverse momentum , and assuming the @xmath3 boson to be on shell , it is possible to reconstruct the neutrino kinematics ( particularly the longitudinal momentum ) with a twofold ambiguity . in the case of the tevatron ,",
    "since it is a @xmath122 collider , it is possible to choose the ` correct ' neutrino kinematics 73% of the times by selecting the maximum ( minimum ) of the two reconstructed values for the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino for @xmath59 ( @xmath123 )  @xcite .",
    "this is not true at the lhc , where due to the symmetry of the colliding beams both reconstructed kinematics have equal chances to be correct .",
    "fortunately , in the case of anomalous couplings , we are interested in a efficient way to reconstruct the @xmath18 rather than the full kinematics .",
    "again there are two possible values of @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that there is a simple method to choose the ` correct ' one 66% of the times at the lhc ( 73% of the times at tevatron ) by selecting the minimum @xmath124 of the two reconstructed values .",
    "this applies to both @xmath59 and @xmath123 production .",
    "furthermore , we checked that the selected value @xmath124 differs in almost 90% of the events by less than 10% from the exact value @xmath18 .",
    "this is likely to be precise enough , since the data will be collected in sizeable bins of @xmath18 and the anomalous parameters are not expected to change very rapidly as a function of the energy . to quantify the advantage of the method",
    ", we show in figures  [ fig : shatwy ] and [ fig : shatacwy ] the correlations of @xmath125 with @xmath85 .",
    "the cross section drops very rapidly for increasing @xmath126 .",
    "this correlation also holds in the particularly interesting large @xmath85 region and also for the anomalous contribution . to investigate the latter point",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig : shatacwy ] the correlation for ( already experimentally ruled out ) huge values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 . for this figure we still use an ordinary form factor but in order to increase the anomalous contribution further we set @xmath129  tev .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : shatwytev ] we show the same correlation for @xmath0 production at the tevatron ( run  ii ) , which corresponds to @xmath122 scattering at @xmath130  tev .",
    "we impose the same kinematical cuts as for the lhc , with the following exceptions : for the transverse momentum of the photon we require @xmath131  gev and the rapidities of the observed lepton has to be in the range @xmath132 ( instead of 2.4 ) . as for the lhc",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the true center of mass energy @xmath85 and the reconstructed one @xmath125 .",
    "again , this correlation also holds in the large @xmath85 region . in figure",
    "[ fig : shatwytev ] no anomalous couplings are included , but we have checked that also for the tevatron the inclusion of large anomalous couplings does not spoil the correlations .    as a result of these investigations",
    "we conclude that even in the case of @xmath0 production reliable bounds for anomalous couplings as a function of @xmath18 can be obtained . to this end",
    "one merely has to do an analysis as in the @xmath1 case but with @xmath124 replacing @xmath18 .",
    "this has the advantage that the anomalous effects can be quantized without introducing the ambiguity of form factors .",
    "such a procedure would certainly facilitate a comparison of various bounds from different experiments .",
    "finally , we note that in principle any quantity which has a very strong correlation with @xmath18 can be used .",

    "in particular , the correlations of @xmath18 with the cluster mass and transverse mass respectively is not quite as strong @xcite .",

    "the leptonic decay of the @xmath3 and @xmath4-boson respectively has been included in the narrow - width approximation .",

    "therefore , only the tree - level amplitudes have to be computed with anomalous couplings .",
    "we do not have to list the explicit results for all possible helicities of the photon and the gluon . in order to reverse the helicities of all gauge bosons , i.e. the photon and the gluon ( if the latter is present ) , we merely have to apply a ` flip ' operation , defined as : 12 ;  34 ;  .b .b ; and a^a a^b ( for w ) [ flip2 ]    the amplitudes @xmath137 given in eqs .
