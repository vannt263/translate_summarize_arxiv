    "the trigger for grb  030329 was made by hete - ii on 29 march 2003 , 11:37:14.67 ut .",
    "information promptly disseminated via the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) by vanderspek et al .",
    "( 2003 ) prompted observations by a huge number of telescopes providing coverage in the x - ray , optical , ir , sub - millimetre and radio wavebands .",
    "the r band magnitude at 1.5 hours was 12.6 making it the brightest optical grb afterglow seen at this epoch .",
    "the grb lasted 25 seconds and had a peak flux of @xmath9 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath1 ( 30 - 400 kev ) and a total fluence of @xmath11 ergs @xmath10 , placing it in the top 0.2% of the observed fluence distribution .",
    "the redshift was determined as z=0.1685 by greiner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and subsequently the isotropic energy released in the grb has been estimated to be @xmath12 ergs ( 30 - 400 kev ) ( hjorth et al . , price et al . , uemura et al . 2003 ) .",
    "here we summarise the continuum afterglow spectrum expected to arise from the standard fireball shock model ( mszros 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "an initial energy @xmath13 ergs is released very rapidly forming a fireball of @xmath14 @xmath15 and gamma - rays which expands at extreme relativistic velocity ( lorentz factor @xmath16 ) into a surrounding medium of density @xmath17 forming a relativistic shock .",
    "a diminishingly small fraction of electrons is accelerated by repeated diffusion across the shock producing a power - law energy spectrum @xmath18 . as the relativistic electrons spiral in the co - moving magnetic field",
    "we expect to see synchrotron radiation .",
    "a frequency @xmath19 is associated with the minimum electron energy @xmath20 produced by the acceleration process .",
    "there will be some corresponding ( very ) high frequency @xmath21 associated with the maximum electron energy @xmath22 .",
    "a cooling - break frequency , @xmath23 , corresponds to the electron energy for which the synchrotron lifetime is comparable with the expansion time .",
    "the detailed form of the spectrum expected is described by sari , piran and narayan ( 1998 ) . at some early time",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 . for @xmath26",
    "the electrons cool rapidly so that @xmath27 and for @xmath28 they cool slowly such that @xmath29 .",
    "all the follow up observations of grb  030329 fall into the latter regime . in the frequency range @xmath30 the spectrum ,",
    "@xmath31 , has an index @xmath32 directly related to the electron index @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath35 the spectrum is steeper , @xmath36 . below the peak , @xmath37",
    ", we expect @xmath38 with the index increasing further to @xmath39 , at @xmath40 the self - absorption break , as the optical depth increases at low frequency .    because the fireball is expanding relativistically with lorentz factor @xmath16 , the spectrum observed is blue - shifted . as the shock is arrested by the surrounding medium @xmath16 decreases and the spectrum becomes redder . at early times",
    "we only see a small fraction of the radiating electrons because of relativistic beaming and only a small fraction of the expanding shock is visible .",
    "as @xmath16 decreases the relativistic beaming angle opens up and if the expansion is isotropic the observed flux at the peak , @xmath41 , remains constant while the frequency of the peak changes as a power - law , @xmath42 .",
    "the self - absorption break , @xmath40 , remains constant but the cooling break also varies as a power law , @xmath43 .",
    "wijers & galama ( 1999 ) provide full expressions for the expected synchrotron spectrum parameters in terms of energy per steradian @xmath44 , ambient interstellar density @xmath17 @xmath3 , @xmath45 the hydrogen mass fraction of the ambient medium , @xmath33 the electron power - law index , @xmath46 and @xmath47 the dimensionless peak location and peak flux which are functions of @xmath33 , @xmath48 the electron energy fraction ( wrt the energy density of nucleons ) , @xmath49 the magnetic energy density fraction ( again wrt the energy density of nucleons ) , the redshift @xmath50 of the grb and finally @xmath51 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "if the relativistic outflow is collimated in a jet with open angle @xmath52 then the evolution of the spectrum is modified ( rhoads 1997 , 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ; frail et al . 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001b ) . at time",
    "@xmath53 , when @xmath54 , we expect to see an achromatic break in the decay of the afterglow because we can see the edge of the jet structure and because the material has time to expand sideways . after the break the decay of the peak flux , peak frequency , the cooling break and the self - absorption break",
    "are modified , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the details of the changes in the decay indices depends on the density profile of the surrounding medium and the time dependence of the jet spreading assumed .",
    "the energy losses of the emitting electrons and the observed spectral form is also expected to be modified by inverse compton scattering ( panaitescu & kumar 2001a , sari & esin 2001 ) .    if @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 then the flux at a frequency @xmath30 has a temporal variation given by : @xmath62 if @xmath63 then for frequencies @xmath35 the spectral form is @xmath64 and the temporal variation is @xmath65 .",
    "the change in spectral index across the cooling break is @xmath66 so at frequencies above the cooling break we have : @xmath67 table [ tab1 ] lists the temporal indices of the peak flux and break frequencies expected before @xmath24 and before and after the jet break ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    ".temporal decay indices before @xmath24 and before and after the jet break @xmath53 .",
    "two sets of values are given for @xmath26 , the first line for an adiabatic shock and the second line for the full radiative case .",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath68 , @xmath60 , @xmath63 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab6 ]    there are a number of possible explanations for the excess flux seen over and above the standard fireball shock .",
    "we will discuss them under three headings ; afterglow effects - modifications to the standard afterglow shock model ; dust echoes - scattering of afterglow radiation back into our line of sight ; sn / hypernova - optical and radio flux from a stellar explosion .",
    "a key feature of the observed residuals is that they are not seen in x - rays and they are not the same in the optical and radio .",
    "the first r - band peak is a short flash while the second r - band peak is a longer outburst and the radio peak reaches a maximum at a much later time than the second r - band peak .      if the ism about the progenitor were inhomogeneous ( varying density @xmath17 ) then we might expect to see rapid and noticeable deviations from a smooth power - law decay .",
    "such an effect was considered by wang & loeb ( 2000 ) and has been used to explain variations seen in several afterglows ( e.g. grb  011211 , holland et al , 2002 ; jakobsson et al , 2003 ; grb 021004 , lazzati et al , 2003 ; holland et al , 2003 ) . for @xmath69 ( nakar , piran and granot 2003 ) and below the cooling break (",
    "@xmath70 , usually the optical regime ) the flux is expected to be @xmath71 whilst for @xmath35 ( the x - ray regime ) the flux is only weakly dependent on density .",
    "therefore the first peak in the r - band flux , which corresponds to a very modest increase @xmath72 , could easily be due to a small increase in ambient density .",
    "however , for @xmath73 the opposite is true ( nakar , piran and granot 2002 ) .",
    "here we expect a change in density to increase the x - ray flux more than the optical .",
    "it is therefore most unlikely that the second r - band peak , which corresponds to an increase of the optical afterglow flux by @xmath74 and is not accompanied by a similar large increase in the x - ray flux , is caused by a rise in ambient density .",
    "refreshed shocks due to sustained activity in the central engine have been used to explain the observed lightcurve of grb  021004 , which was unusually flat for the first few hours , and shows correlated x - ray and optical changes ( fox et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "this model has also been invoked for grb  030329 ( granot , nakar and piran 2003 ) .",
    "refreshed shocks should be seen as correlated outbursts in the x - ray and optical decays although the fractional increase seen in optical and x - ray is not expected to be the same ( sari & mszros 2000 ) . at the same time we might also expect to see a change in the x - ray and optical spectra .",
    "because of the sparse x - ray coverage we can not rule out the possibility that the optical excess arises from refreshed shocks and any associated small increase in the x - ray flux was unfortunately missed .",
    "however , the fit of the standard model to the available x - ray data is very good and we see no change in x - ray spectral index .",
    "we think it is unlikely that all the excess optical flux arises from refreshed shocks .",
    "there is variability in the excess flux of the second peak and at least three more re - brightenings were identified by granot , nakar and piran ( 2003 ) at @xmath75 days , @xmath76 days and @xmath77 days .",
    "they favour refreshed shocks as the most likely explanation for these features .",
    "however , analysis of millimeter observations presented by sheth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) shows that there is no short - lived millimeter emission associated with bumps in the optical light curve indicating that central engine of the grb was not injecting energy on these timescales .",
    "a further possibility is that we are observing lateral structure within the jet rather than axial structure imposed by the ambient medium .",
    "this possibility is investigated by granot & kumar ( 2003 ) , kumar & granot ( 2003 ) and salmonson ( 2003 ) .",
    "however such structure is expected to modify the overall evolution of the light curve producing , for example , a late temporal break in the afterglow decay and is not expected to produce rapid variations or bursts .",
    "we conclude that at least the second optical bump is not due to afterglow effects .",
    "dust echos were considered to be a possible explanation of late time bumps in the light curves of some grbs ( waxman & draine , 2000 ) . in this scenario dust",
    "close to the burst is sublimed by the prompt x - ray and euv radiation , whilst dust beyond the sublimation radius absorbs the energy and then re - radiates it at longer wavelengths .",
    "bumps or flares are expected to occur at late times after the grb ( the the exact times being a function of the sublimation radius of the burst , and of course the assumed beaming geometry ) . because dust sublimes at @xmath78k the bumps are necessarily very red and are unlikely to have significant flux in the optical band .",
    "we do not consider them a viable explanation of the bumps in grb  030329 .",
    "esin & blandford ( 2000 ) , and subsequently reichart ( 2001 ) , take a different approach in which the scattering of the initial optical flash by the dust is responsible for a bump in the afterglow light curve . reichart ( 2001 )",
    "finds that for values of @xmath79 degrees , and small sublimation radii the echo can reach maximum in less than one day , consistent with the first r - band peak . if the efficiency of the reflection / scattering process is @xmath80 it is unlikely that these models can explain the second r - band peak which has a very large integrated energy implying a huge initial burst .      at @xmath81 grb  030329 provides a unique opportunity to probe the early behaviour of any associated sn .",
    "there is overwhelming evidence that the spectroscopic signature of a sn type ic forms part of the optical afterglow of grb  030329 ( hjorth et al .",
    "this supernova has been designated sn2003dh ( stanek et al .",
    "2003a , garnavich et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the expansion velocity measured at 10 days was @xmath82 km s@xmath1 , larger than any previously know sn and it is therefore worthy of the title hypernova .",
    "crude spectroscopic dating concludes that the sn was coincident with grb  030329 @xmath83 days ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ) . using the spectroscopic evidence alone matheson et al . ( 2003 ) conclude that sn2003dh emerges at @xmath84 days .",
    "the photometric evidence ( after subtraction of the standard afterglow component ) and the onset of the changes in optical spectrum for @xmath85 days ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) indicate that the optical flux associated with sn2003dh is detected earlier than this .    any premaximum display of variability in the sn lightcurve including the shock breakout and structure introduced as the shock propagates through the layered structure of the star may be visible .",
    "indeed , the short first r - band peak followed by the extended second r - band peak shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are very similar to the model light curves of type ib sn models shown by ensman & woosley ( 1998 ) , although the time scale is a factor of 6 - 10 faster .",
    "models of type ic sne by nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) indicate that the peak of the luminosity for such events should occur in the range 10 - 15 days .",
    "the peak of the main outburst in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is at @xmath86 days , much earlier than predicted from the models .",
    "sn1998bw peaked at @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) . scaling this to z=0.1685",
    "gives @xmath89 , therefore the peak of the long optical outburst in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] @xmath90 is @xmath91 times brighter than sn1998bw , having @xmath92 .",
    "the sn 1b models of ensman & woosley ( 1988 ) produce a main peak fwhm of 25 days as observed for sn1983n ( the only event for which good data are available ) , which is only possible for the lower mass models ( wolf - rayet = 4 - 6 m@xmath93 , orig mass = 15 - 20 m@xmath93 ) .",
    "more massive models create broader peaks , as do less powerful explosions .",
    "a smaller ejected mass gives a lower duration because the radioactive luminosity diffuses out quicker .",
    "however a small ejected mass results in a dim sn since it is powered by the ejected ni . in modelling sn 1998bw nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that the main peak width is proportional to the ejected mass @xmath94 and the explosion energy @xmath95 , while the velocities scale as @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "these relationships point to either a low ejected mass or a high powered explosion in grb  030329 or both .",
    "the fwhm of 1998bw was @xmath98 days and the ejection velocity at 10 days is @xmath99 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is fit with @xmath100 ergs and @xmath101 m@xmath93 by nakamura et al .",
    "scaling from this we estimate the energy and mass of sn2003dh as @xmath102 ergs and @xmath103 @xmath104 .",
    "this is a significantly lower ejected mass than considered by ensman & woosley ( their values were based on there being a he envelope present ) .",
    "sheth et al . (",
    "2003 ) and berger et al .",
    "( 2003b ) suggest that the observed excess radio and millimeter flux ( and by implication excess optical flux ) from grb  030329 arises from a second slower and wider jet - like outflow .",
    "the shock in such an outflow would generate a spectrum similar to the standard model illustrated in fig",
    ". [ fig4 ] but with the absorption break and peak shifted to much lower frequencies .",
    "this could account for the broad radio and optical excess but would not generate a significant x - ray flux , consistent with the analysis presented above .",
    "it might also explain the change in the optical spectral index which starts at t=1 day .",
    "however it would not account for the very fast optical flux increase seen at the onset of the second optical peak .",
    "this would require a large extra injection of energy at t=1 day , similar in kind to a refreshed shock , rather than a slower , wider outflow launched at t=0 .",
    "the duration and timing of the radio peak are very similar to known rsne .",
    "however , the peak luminosity of @xmath105 ergs s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 is a factor of @xmath106 higher than typical type ib / c rsne ( weiler et al .",
    "2002 ) but very similar to the radio afterglows seen for grb  991208 , @xmath107 ergs s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 , and for grb  970508 , @xmath108 ergs s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 ( frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ) at 5 ghz .",
    "this , again , clearly indicates that the hypernova in grb  030329 was indeed a powerful event .",
    "the combination of a rapid first peak and a very bright second peak is not predicted by standard models of sne .",
    "the second peak is too bright and reaches peak too quickly to be entirely fuelled by the radioactive decay of a large mass of @xmath109ni ( woosley & heger 2003 ) .",
    "if the excess flux is directly associated with the hypernova then it arises from the injection of energy from some other source .",
    "both the optical and radio maxima were very bright compared with previously observed sne / hypernovae .",
    "this may be due to the geometry of the explosion rather than just a very large explosion energy .",
    "the ejecta could be beamed and/or the visible envelope of the expanding photosphere might be flattened .",
    "since the hypernova was concurrent with a grb this seems reasonable although we know of no detailed models which address such a scenario .",
    "the high quality and extensive coverage of data available from grb  030329 has enabled us to calculate the physical parameters of the event with high precision and has revealed important details about the concurrent hypernova sn2003dh .",
    "the grb released an energy of @xmath110 ergs into a jet with open angle @xmath111 degrees and about @xmath112 of this energy was radiated away as @xmath113 rays .",
    "the jet propagated in a medium with @xmath114 @xmath3 and the shock generated an relativistic electron spectrum with index @xmath115 .",
    "the electron and magnetic field energy densities in the shock were @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "a jet break occurred at @xmath118 days after which the peak flux of the afterglow , @xmath41 , decayed with @xmath119 .    it is likely that the lightcurves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are directly associated with the hypernova sn2003dh .",
    "this event had the spectroscopic signature of a sn 1c by 8 - 10 days",
    "but the fast rise and decline in the optical , the very bright optical peak and the large radio excess are not standard sn 1c properties .",
    "the excess optical and radio flux probably arise from an afterglow powered by a central engine such as the disk wind component proposed by woosley & heger ( 2003 ) but injection of energy at @xmath120 day is required to explain the sudden emergence of the second optical peak .",

    "<S> no deviation from the best - fit afterglow model is seen in the x - ray decline , indicating that the excess optical and radio flux from 1 - 5 days arises from a later injection of slower electrons by the central engine .    </S>",
