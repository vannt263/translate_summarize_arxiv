    "recent measurements at lep suggest an excess of events containing pairs of tau leptons , though the observation is only of marginal statistical significance @xcite : around @xmath1 ignoring systematic errors .",
    "it is interesting to study such a possibility , even if only to prepare oneself for the future when the first definitive hint of physics beyond the standard model emerges .",
    "an excess of tau lepton pairs could arise from the direct production of a pair of tau sleptons , which subsequently decay to tau leptons and gravitino or neutralino lsp s .",
    "the tau sleptons may also be produced indirectly in the decays of charginos or neutralinos . using the available data , a kinematic and dynamical analysis",
    "is performed to exclude some mechanisms and constrain others .",
    "based on this , one can more easily establish the existence of a small signal if it is there .",
    "we map out the softly broken susy lagrangian , show how the mass and wave function of the lsp can be deduced from kinematic distributions and event rates , and study the implications for the fermilab tevatron .",
    "an overall excess of tau leptons is observed in all four lep experiments in a sample of 220 pb@xmath2 of data per experiment accumulated between @xmath3 and @xmath4 gev .",
    "there appears to be a threshold above @xmath5 gev , possibly above @xmath6 gev , with a steady excess distributed over energy .",
    "the excess sets the size of the production cross section times branching ratio times detection efficiency at about @xmath7 pb . the kinematics are indicative of a large mass splitting @xmath8 between a heavier superpartner and the lsp .",
    "no other excesses are reported by all four experiments .",
    "our objective is to take this observation seriously and consider its susy implications .",
    "the experimental analysis assumes a specific susy signal with a range of @xmath8 values , and cuts on the observables are optimized for this signal .",
    "there is no direct measurement of @xmath8 .",
    "instead , quantities such as the visible energy @xmath9 are measured which are correlated with @xmath8 . in the remainder , we will focus on the fraction of visible energy @xmath10 as the main characteristic of the signal .",
    "the @xmath11 range depends on the hypothesized susy signal , and thus is different for slepton pair production or neutralino / chargino production . for slepton pair production , the l3 experiment analyzes the low , medium , and high @xmath11 ranges defined as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 gev @xcite . for tau slepton production ,",
    "the maximum value in each range is degraded somewhat , since tau decays have an intrinsic missing energy . for neutralino or chargino pair production ,",
    "the upper end of each range is roughly double those for slepton pair production @xcite .",
    "this can be understood roughly as the difference between the kinematics of 2- and 3-body decays .",
    "the optimized cuts used by l3 for the large @xmath8 signal of the tau slepton analysis can be summarized as two reconstructed clusters of particles satisfying the following requirements @xcite : @xmath15 the experimental quantities used above are the summed @xmath16 of the two clusters , the electron or muon energy @xmath17 , the polar angle @xmath18 of the missing energy vector @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the two final state clusters , and the azimuthal angle between the two clusters @xmath22 .",
    "when a quantitative measure of the efficiency is needed , the signature @xmath23 or @xmath24+low - multiplicity hadronic cluster is used , since it represents a large branching fraction with little qcd background .",
    "these cuts have an efficiency of approximately @xmath25 on an hypothesized signal of tau slepton pair production .",
    "our starting hypothesis for a phenomenological analysis is that the tau excess results from the production of tau slepton , neutralino , or chargino pairs or some combination of these .",
    "for reference , various sparticle production cross sections are shown as a function of collider energy in figure  [ fig : xsections ] .",
    "the sum of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 processes is shown for the cases of @xmath28 and @xmath29 gev ( short - dashed lines ) , the @xmath30 process for @xmath31 , and 90 gev ( solid lines ) , and the @xmath32 process for @xmath33 and 97 gev ( long - dashed lines ) .",
    "the cross sections were calculated using , with @xmath34 @xmath35300 gev for neutralino pair production , and @xmath36 tev , @xmath37 , @xmath38 gev , and @xmath39 gev for chargino pair production .",
    "the data points , denoted by the circles with error bars @xcite , are from a preliminary analysis by the lep susy working group assuming tau slepton pair production .",
    "the data appears to be compatible with direct tau slepton production and @xmath40 gev or with @xmath41 production with @xmath42 185 gev and a heavier tau slepton .",
    "because of its quick rise with energy , the chargino cross section does not agree well with the data . in the next few sections , we fill in the details surrounding these statements . since neutralino pair production is an indirect source of tau sleptons ,",
    "we describe first the simpler case of direct stau pair production",
    ".      the production and decay chain @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the lightest tau slepton and @xmath45 may be a light gravitino or the lightest neutralino , can produce an excess of tau leptons with missing energy .",
    "for simplicity of the discussion , it is assumed that the @xmath44 is a pure interaction eigenstate , either @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "tau slepton pairs are produced through @xmath48 and @xmath49 decays .",
    "the @xmath49 contribution depends on the tau eigenstate , but this effect is small .",
    "the @xmath46 cross section is slightly larger than the @xmath47 one , and in the limit that @xmath50 , the following relation holds : @xmath51 and there is little variation in the total rate from left - right mixing . to get the desired cross section",
    ", the tau slepton must be fairly light , but it also must have avoided detection at the @xmath52 pole and at other intermediate collider energies . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xsections ] , it can be seen that a right - handed stau with a mass of about 80 gev yields the correct cross section , assuming that the efficiency is about @xmath25 .",
    "mixing can not make the cross section arbitrarily small , so a light tau slepton is already excluded .    as mentioned previously",
    ", a large fraction of visible energy is the main characteristic of the signal .",
    "an upper bound on the visible energy in each event is roughly the sum of the tau energies . in the rest @xmath53 frame of the tau slepton ,",
    "the tau energy is @xmath54 .",
    "the boost to the lab frame introduces a factor @xmath55 , and the fraction of visible energy is : @xmath56 this estimate ignores the direction of the boost and the energy lost to neutrinos in @xmath57 decays , but is useful in distinguishing models . the value of @xmath58 is obtained for a light gravitino lsp , which yields a large fraction of visible energy .",
    "however , we would have arrived at the same estimate for @xmath59 pair production , which is the dominant background , so one should be careful about drawing conclusions about the size of a signal before considering the cuts necessary to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "for the case of a neutralino lsp , a fraction @xmath60 requires @xmath61 .",
    "this illustrates the necessary mass relations to explain the kinematics of the data .    for @xmath62 gev , the efficiency after the cuts listed in eq .",
    "[ eq : cuts ] is roughly constant at @xmath25 ( see table 3 of ref .",
    "the efficiencies listed there are in accord with our own simulations ) .",
    "therefore , a nlsp @xmath63 with @xmath64 gev and a large mass splitting between the tau slepton and the lsp can explain the tau excess . for a neutralino lsp ,",
    "this predicts @xmath65 gev for @xmath66 .",
    "there is no rigorous experimental lower bound on @xmath67 if the @xmath68 wave function contains no higgsino components .",
    "since the kinematics suggest @xmath69 , and a light wino- or higgsino - like lsp requires a light chargino , a neutralino lsp should be bino - like .    if @xmath70 , in which case the stau is no longer the nlsp , a light @xmath71 is also required by the sum rule @xmath72 .",
    "once @xmath73 is larger than a few , it is a good approximation to take the squared mass splitting to be @xmath74 .",
    "the lower bound on the sneutrino mass is @xmath75 , leading to the bounds @xmath76 gev . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xsections ] , one can estimate that @xmath70 can be marginally consistent with the data .",
    "if one does not assume large @xmath73 , then @xmath77 allows for @xmath78 and @xmath79 gev .",
    "apropos to a @xmath46 solution , if the gravitino is the lsp and @xmath80 is heavier than about a mev , the decay @xmath81 will occur before @xmath82 , because of the small gravitino coupling to matter .",
    "this is not compatible with the data , because of the many @xmath83 decay modes .",
    "therefore , a gravitino lsp and a light @xmath46 can be rejected .",
    "the possibility that @xmath84 is the lsp and @xmath68 is heavy can also be rejected , since the decays @xmath85 would also occur . on the other hand , the mass hierarchies @xmath86 and @xmath87 are viable .",
    "for the former case , @xmath67 must be close to @xmath88 to satisfy the kinematic requirement @xmath89 , while the latter case allows for a substantially lighter @xmath68 .",
    "the existence of @xmath71 with @xmath78 is not very relevant , as long as @xmath90 is the dominant stau decay , since @xmath91 and @xmath92 are both invisible decays , and direct @xmath93 lsp and @xmath94 lsp production are difficult to observe .",
    "an admixture of @xmath46 and @xmath47 pair production is possible , and this would lead to mixed kinematics in the data .",
    "kinematic correlations between the tau pair decay products can provide more information on the quantum numbers of the tau slepton .",
    "the tau lepton carries @xmath95 or @xmath96 polarization ( in the rest frame of the stau ) depending on whether the parent is @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "pair production of @xmath47 then yields a correlation in the kinematics of the decay products of the tau leptons . as an example , if the decays @xmath97 and @xmath98 occur , the @xmath99 will tend to be hard while the @xmath100 is soft , _",
    "i.e. _ the correlation is @xmath101 or @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote the stau wave function and a subscript @xmath105 or @xmath106 denotes soft or hard kinematics .",
    "these considerations are relevant even if the tau sleptons are produced through on - shell decays of neutralinos or charginos .",
    "this polarization effect is included in our particle - level simulations .    to summarize ,",
    "a tau excess can be explained by tau slepton pair production for a narrow range of tau slepton masses .",
    "the cross section ( using an efficiency of @xmath107 ) is compatible with a @xmath47 with mass around 80 gev .",
    "the stau may be left - handed , but large @xmath73 requires @xmath108 gev .",
    "the kinematics of the decays suggest @xmath109 , so that that @xmath110 @xmath111 or @xmath112 is possible .",
    "the two lsp cases are kinematically distinguishable , or , more precisely , the mass of the lsp can be inferred from kinematic distributions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stau_dist ] , which shows the @xmath9 and @xmath113 distributions divided by @xmath114 gev for @xmath115 gev and a neutralino lsp with @xmath116 gev ( solid lines ) and a gravitino lsp ( long - dashed lines ) . the distributions from @xmath27 production",
    "are also shown ( short - dashed lines ) for @xmath117 gev and @xmath118 gev .",
    "the dominant @xmath119 background is not included .",
    "a measurement of the cross section at several energies , as well as analysis of kinematic distributions such as these , would allow the various scenarios to be separated .",
    "the production and decay chain @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , where @xmath45 is the lsp and @xmath123 and/or @xmath124 , can also yield a tau pair and missing energy .",
    "the case of @xmath125 is considered here with a brief comment on a gravitino lsp .",
    "the relevance of 3-body decays of the neutralino is also addressed .",
    "the @xmath41 process can be kinematically accessible before chargino and possibly tau slepton pair production .",
    "the kinematic requirements set by the data are that @xmath126 gev , while the production cross section requires @xmath127 gev , so that @xmath128 gev is marginally plausible . of course , it is necessary that @xmath129 to prevent @xmath130 as the dominant decay .",
    "the production of neutralino pairs proceeds through the @xmath52 in the @xmath105-channel or through @xmath131-channel exchanges of selectrons . in the notation of haber and kane @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath132 coupling is @xmath133 . for @xmath41 production to be relevant",
    ", both neutralinos must have some higgsino component .",
    "this requirement means that the @xmath49 contribution to the decay can be significant if 2-body decays are not allowed .",
    "because the excess appears in tau lepton final states , we assume the selectron is not too light .",
    "two - body decays of @xmath138 can satisfy the kinematic requirements if there is sufficient mass splitting @xmath139 so that the tau produced in the cascade @xmath121 is not too soft . as before , it is useful to have a simple estimate of the kinematics @xmath140 . again , the visible energy is approximately the sum of the tau energies .",
    "since the tau leptons result from the cascade decays of heavy objects , @xmath141 , the tau energies can be approximated by their values in the rest frame of their individual parents .",
    "this assumes that the kinematic boost is small .",
    "the fraction of visible energy can then be described approximately by : @xmath142 the example noted above , @xmath143 gev , @xmath144 gev , @xmath145 gev , can satisfy the nominal kinematic requirements , with @xmath146 . because of the @xmath147-wave suppression of the production cross section",
    ", @xmath148 production would be negligible in this situation .",
    "the example cross sections shown in figure  [ fig : xsections ] for neutralino pair production are within range of the observed tau excess , while large values of @xmath140 can be obtained for sufficiently large mass splittings .",
    "a scan over a range of @xmath149 and @xmath73 revealed solutions of the form : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the total sparticle production cross section and @xmath152 is the detection efficiency using the cuts described in eq .",
    "[ eq : cuts ] . for each case , @xmath153 was chosen to maximize @xmath140 .",
    "the efficiencies @xmath152 from particle level simulations are approximately @xmath25 , similar to those obtained for tau slepton pair production . to decrease the size of the production cross section @xmath154 to a plausible level ,",
    "the selectron mass parameters were both fixed at 300 gev .",
    "the requirement of a heavy chargino not only prevents chargino pair production , but also suppresses the decay @xmath155 .",
    "the observed cross section @xmath156 is allowed to be as large as @xmath157 pb , since there is some flexibility in setting the overall rate .",
    "a heavier selectron mass will significantly reduce the @xmath41 cross section .",
    "tau slepton pair production also contributes to the total event rate , and left - right mixing can reduce the @xmath148 contribution , or the tau slepton mass can be larger than the value with maximizes the estimate @xmath140 , thereby reducing the cross section . if @xmath46 is light , instead of @xmath47 , then the decay @xmath158 will reduce the visible cross section .",
    "some solutions had @xmath27 production as the dominant production mechanism , while others had only @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 , the solutions clustered into the regions @xmath159 gev , @xmath160 gev , @xmath161 gev ( the exact upper and lower bounds depend on the sign of @xmath24 ) , with no real constraint on @xmath73 . for @xmath26 production , the regions are @xmath162 gev , @xmath163 gev , @xmath164 gev .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath68 lsp in all solutions has a large bino composition , with @xmath165 in the range @xmath166 for @xmath26 production , and @xmath167 for @xmath27 production .",
    "the requirement that @xmath168 gev strongly affects the solutions .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc1 ] shows the relation between the chargino mass and the observed cross section at @xmath114 gev for the dominant @xmath26 solutions ( o ) and @xmath27 ones ( x ) .",
    "the chargino is never heavier than 125 gev , and some solutions predict that the threshold for pair production is close to the current lep2 energy .    to summarize , @xmath41 production can produce the correct tau excess by providing an indirect source of tau sleptons .",
    "in essence , the @xmath41 process extends the possible range of tau slepton masses beyond that derived solely from direct stau production .",
    "the neutralino lsp should also be bino - like , but mainly for kinematic reasons .",
    "the decay @xmath169 can have a large branching fraction in this case only if the tau slepton contribution can overcome the @xmath49 one .",
    "this requires a light tau slepton and large @xmath73 . in the pure higgsino limit",
    ", the equality of the stau and @xmath49 couplings requires @xmath170 or @xmath171 , where we have taken @xmath172 .",
    "color factors and additional couplings increase this value somewhat , which is already beyond perturbative limits .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of @xmath41 production , followed by the 3-body decay of @xmath173 , is not very promising in explaining the tau excess .    in gmsb , @xmath93 production is a possible source of tau leptons if the tau slepton is the nlsp .",
    "however , there are several difficulties : ( 1 ) four tau leptons will be produced in the final state  two may be soft , but some of these should still be visible ; ( 2 ) one half of the time the two hardest taus will have the same charge ; ( 3 ) small @xmath24 is needed , which is difficult to achieve in the minimal model .",
    "other production modes , such as @xmath174 or @xmath175 , will produce final states with too much structure from cascade decays .",
    "chargino pair production does not appear to be a viable explanation of a tau excess . however , it is possible that a slight increase in collider energy will cross the kinematic threshold for chargino pair production , so a brief discussion is in order .",
    "chargino pair production at lep proceeds mainly through the coupling of the chargino pair to an off - shell photon or a @xmath176 boson or @xmath131-channel electron sneutrino exchange .",
    "the @xmath177 coupling depends on @xmath178 and @xmath179 , _ i.e. _ the coupling is significant whether the chargino is wino - like , higgsino - like , or of a mixed composition . for this reason ,",
    "the chargino production cross is large compared to other sparticle processes in almost any model .",
    "the total cross section does depend on the electron sneutrino mass , and a light electron sneutrino can significantly reduce the event rate by an order of magnitude from the heavy sneutrino limit .",
    "the example cross sections shown in figure  [ fig : xsections ] , for the case of @xmath180 gev , already exhibit a threshold dependence that is too rapid to explain the data .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to explain the dip at @xmath114 gev , though this is challenging for all the scenarios considered .",
    "one can consider smaller values for @xmath181 , but @xmath182 will lead to an electron excess .",
    "it is important to note that chargino pair production can yield the correct kinematics .",
    "the decay @xmath183 through a higgsino component of the chargino wave function will produce energetic tau leptons from the @xmath47 decay .",
    "the same is true for @xmath46 , except this does not require higgsino components to the chargino , and there will also be the decay @xmath184 . if @xmath185 , then the latter decay may be the dominant one . the decay @xmath186 is assumed to complete the chain , so that these decays will be essentially invisible .",
    "large values of @xmath140 are obtained for @xmath187 if @xmath188 .",
    "the decay @xmath184 requires @xmath189 to generate large @xmath140 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the values of the soft susy - breaking parameters that are consistent with the kinematics and event rate of a tau excess .",
    "one concern is how to arrange for an excess in only tau leptons .",
    "the phenomenological analysis of the previous section requires that a tau slepton is lighter than the selectron .",
    "this is not unreasonable , since the connection between the selectron and stau masses depends on theoretical prejudice . at the high mass scale where the soft susy - breaking parameters of the mssm are initially induced ,",
    "the mass parameters associated with the selectron and stau may only be loosely related .",
    "for example , if the sleptons have a common mass parameter at the planck scale , the evolution of these parameters to the gut scale , where extra gut fields are decoupled , can lead to non - universality .",
    "there are potentially several different mass scales associated with different physics ( the gut scale physics , compactification scale , _ etc .",

    "direct slepton production has never been considered as a promising avenue for discovering susy at hadron colliders .",
    "considering only physics backgrounds from real tau leptons , @xmath229 , @xmath119 and @xmath230 production will be the dominant sources .",
    "since slepton pair production has a rate of roughly @xmath231 fb@xmath2 at the tevatron , it will be difficult to achieve @xmath232 . establishing a tau slepton signal",
    "will clearly be more challenging than establishing a selectron or smuon one , as is the case at lep .",
    "if neutralino pair production is the source of the tau excess at lep , then susy production rates at the tevatron will be much larger , because the chargino is light .",
    "@xmath41 production can not be too large , because the size of the cross section at lep must be comparable to slepton pair production .",
    "chargino pair production will be a much more copious source of tau lepton pairs , so that @xmath233 may be achievable .",
    "since the lsp should be bino - like , @xmath234 and @xmath235 have similar wave function compositions , so that @xmath236 is a large cross section , leading to the tri - tau signatures considered in previous studies . if @xmath234 is higgsino - like , then @xmath237 production will be a source of up to four tau leptons , though two are likely to be soft",
    ". the two hard ones can have the same sign .",
    "it is an interesting experimental question whether the * single - prong * hadronic decays of the tau have sufficiently small background to be part of a like - sign signal .",
    "a significant mass splitting between the selectron and stau masses may require moderate or large values of @xmath73 .",
    "another consequence of large @xmath73 would be its impact on higgs boson phenomenology .",
    "properties of higgs bosons may be significantly altered @xcite .",
    "in particular , at large @xmath73 , a sbottom - bottom - gluino loop can shift the bottom quark yukawa from its tree level value , possibly leading to enhanced light higgs boson decays to tau , @xmath59 and photon pairs . as is usual in large @xmath73 models",
    ", the associated production of higgs bosons with bottom quark pairs would be a promising avenue for discovering one or more higgs bosons .",
    "if large @xmath73 is indeed a necessary component of the explanation , then the bottom squark may also be light , leading to a @xmath238 signature @xcite .",
    "the signature is unlikely to be modified by the presence of a light chargino and tau slepton .",
    "of course , in the neutralino pair scenario , the bottom quark can not be so light that it influences the neutralino decays .",
    "furthermore , there may be a light top squark , though this is not required by the results of our phenomenological analysis of the tau excess .",
    "if we exclude the possibility of a top squark so light that @xmath239 is relevant , then the decay @xmath240 will occur , with @xmath241 .",
    "stop pair production can then lead to a sample of top - like events with an enrichment of tau leptons .",
    "assuming a top squark mass equal to the top mass , and the approximate relation that top squark production is @xmath242 of top quark production , then there would be roughly 25 events containing @xmath23 or @xmath24 + one hadronic tau decay in @xmath243 pb@xmath2 of data .",
    "if the detection efficiency is several percent , then this would be compatible with the cdf data @xcite",
    ".    for some time , there has been indirect evidence that the gluino is light @xcite .",
    "once we give up on the idea of a universal boundary condition for the gaugino masses , as is required by the results of the phenomenological analysis , there is no compelling reason to believe that the gluino is significantly heavier than the lsp .",
    "pair production of gluino pairs or the associated production of gluinos and charginos are a source of like - sign charginos , which decay into like - sign tau leptons .",
    "the branching ratio for a pair @xmath23 or @xmath24 leptons from @xmath57 pair decay is about 12% , but some of the leptons make be fairly soft .",
    "clearly , the use of hadronic tau decays will improve the experimental sensitivity .    to summarize , a tau excess at lep",
    "may translate directly into a tau excess at tevatron if a number of sparticles are light .",
    "some likely light candidates are the gluino and the bottom and top squarks .",
    "the reasons that each of these are light , however , may have different physics origins that are not directly related to the existence of a light tau slepton .",
    "one interesting consequence of a stable lsp is a potential solution to all or part of the dark matter problem .",
    "a consistent explanation of the tau excess in models with a neutralino lsp led us to consider a right - handed tau slepton and a bino - like lsp .",
    "for such a case , the relic abundance is given by @xcite : @xmath244 where @xmath245 gev , @xmath246 for the mass range under consideration , and @xmath247 counts the effective number of light right - handed sleptons .",
    "@xmath248 for three mass degenerate right - handed sleptons , and @xmath249 when a light stau dominates with mixing angle @xmath191 .",
    "based on the kinematic analysis of the data , the range @xmath250 can be compatible with the observed @xmath140 .",
    "fixing @xmath251 gev and @xmath252 leads to the range @xmath253 .",
    "larger values can be obtained if the purity of the stau eigenstate is reduced , smaller ones if the selectron and smuon are also light ( but heavier than the stau ) .",
    "effects such as co - annihilation or @xmath254 pole can only diminish the relic abundance . in the neutralino pair production scenario ,",
    "the bino composition of the lsp@xmath255 is approximately @xmath256 , leading to a relic abundance almost twice as large .    in the approximations made in the kinematic analyses above",
    ", the visible energy fraction is consistently @xmath257 . for the case of neutralino pair production and decay",
    ", this requires that the contribution from the @xmath138 decay and from the tau slepton decay are similar in magnitude , which is reasonable . using this relation , it is possible to re - express the equation above in terms of a collider observable . using the previous example but without fixing @xmath258 , one finds : @xmath259 this relation indicates that @xmath260 is expected unless the mass splitting between the nlsp and lsp is quite large , leading to @xmath261 .",
    "this study has considered the interpretation of a tau excess at lep within the mssm . after an analysis of the size of the cross section , the kinematics , and the absence of other signatures",
    ", we conclude that the most likely explanation of a tau excess at lep is neutralino or tau slepton pair production . here",
    ", we summarize the various scenarios considered to generate an excess of only tau leptons with a fairly large fraction of visible energy .",
    "direct tau slepton pair production may be the dominant source of a tau excess .",
    "the cross section for @xmath262 gev is in agreement with the data . unless @xmath73 is small , a right - handed tau slepton is preferred .",
    "a gravitino lsp can easily accommodate the kinematics , as well as a neutralino lsp with mass less than about @xmath263 .",
    "a neutralino lsp should be bino - like to be consistent with the invisible width of the @xmath52 boson .",
    "for the case of a neutralino lsp , many motivated models would predict other light sparticles within reach of lep searches , but there is no such prediction from our phenomenological analysis .",
    "alternatively , the associated production of neutralino pairs @xmath26 and/or @xmath27 , followed by two - body decays of the heavy neutralinos to a tau and stau , may be the dominant source of a tau excess .",
    "the tau slepton should have a mass that is separated enough from both neutralino masses so that the tau leptons are fairly energetic .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath153 extend beyond those compatible with solely direct stau pair production .",
    "despite the fact that the production process proceeds through higgsino components of the neutralinos , the neutralino lsp has a large bino component to its wave function .",
    "this is fixed by the large mass splitting needed between the two neutralinos to generate the correct kinematics .",
    "the chargino is predicted to be light , though not yet kinematically accessible at lep , or it would influence the neutralino decays or produce its own excess .    finally , chargino pair production may be the dominant source of a tau excess , but the cross section turns on rapidly above the kinematic threshold , and is not likely to explain all data .",
    "it is straightforward to satisfy the kinematic constraints of the observed excess if a stau or tau sneutrino is lighter than the chargino , so chargino pair production will be readily observable once the kinematic threshold is crossed",
    ".    tau slepton pair production with a gravitino lsp falls within the minimal gmsb framework .",
    "the case of a neutralino lsp , in conjunction with tau slepton and/or neutralino pair production , requires a deviation from the usual msugra relations between gaugino masses .",
    "neutralino pair production requires @xmath264 and @xmath265 . in all cases",
    ", the theoretical framework should predict that the selectron and smuon are heavier than the stau .",
    "large values of @xmath73 may be necessary to accomplish this .    at lep ,",
    "a marginal increase in energy will not substantially increase the tau slepton or neutralino cross sections , and the expected amount of data can not establish more than a @xmath266 effect @xcite .",
    "however , in either case , but particularly in the neutralino pair scenario , a kinematic threshold for a new process may well be nearby .",
    "if the threshold for chargino pair production is crossed , the tau signal will be enhanced considerably .",
    "in such an interpretation , the neutralino can still be a viable cdm candidate .",
    "the situation at hadron colliders , particularly the tevatron , depends on how many sparticles besides the tau slepton and lsp are light .",
    "the production of neutralinos depends on their wave functions , but charginos will likely be produced copiously . the msugra trilepton signature becomes more specifically a tri - tau excess .",
    "top squark decays to bottom and a chargino can lead to top - like events with an excess of tau leptons .",
    "gluino pair or gluino - chargino production can lead to like - sign tau events , which , in turn , can yield like - sign @xmath23 s or @xmath24 s . knowing some sparticle masses from lep measurements would greatly enhance detection prospects .",
