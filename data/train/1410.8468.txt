    "we prove that the graph of a discontinuous monomial is either connected or totally disconnected , and we characterize the discontinuous monomial functions @xmath1 with connected graph by means of a big graph property .",
    "we also study the connected components of the graphs of additive functions @xmath2 for @xmath5 .",

    "is an easy corollary of the structure of these functions and jones s existence result of additive discontinuous functions with connected graph .",
    "recall that @xmath1 is an @xmath0-monomial function if it is a solution of the so called monomial functional equation @xmath6 it is known that @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 for a certain multi - additive and symmetric function @xmath10 , and that @xmath7 is a polynomial function of degree at most @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath7 solves frchet s functional equation @xmath11 ) if and only if @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a @xmath14-monomial function for @xmath15 .",

    "let @xmath7 be an @xmath0-monomial .",
    "suppose that @xmath17 is not totally disconnected .",
    "then there exists a connected component @xmath19 containing at least two different points @xmath20 and @xmath21 . clearly , @xmath22 . hence ,",
    "if @xmath23 denotes the horizontal projection of the plane , @xmath24 , then @xmath25 is a connected subset of @xmath26 which contains two distinct points .",
    "hence @xmath27 is an interval with non - empty interior and @xmath28 .",
    "set @xmath29 and @xmath30 . obviously , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "in particular either @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "assume , with no loss of generality , that @xmath33 ( the other case can be treated with similar arguments , or reduced to this one by using that every monomial is either even or odd , since @xmath35 for all rational number @xmath36 and all @xmath37 , which implies that @xmath38 for all @xmath37 ) .",
    "given @xmath39 we consider the maps @xmath40 then @xmath41 is continuous . hence @xmath42 is a connected subset of the plane for every @xmath43 .",
    "given @xmath43 , we have that @xmath44 if and only if for some @xmath45 the equality @xmath46 holds .",
    "in other words , this intersection is nonempty if and only if @xmath47 forcing equality between the first components of these vectors we get @xmath48 , which means that @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , under this restriction , we get the equality between the second components of the vectors for free , since @xmath50 thus , we have demonstrated that @xmath44 if and only if there exist @xmath51 such that @xmath52 . in particular , when this holds true , the property is satisfied for all @xmath43 simultaneously and @xmath53 is connected .",

    "assume , by the moment , that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and take @xmath60 such that @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath58 and @xmath61 imply that @xmath62 .",
    "take @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 too .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath57 is a connected subset of @xmath17 .",

    "finally , let us consider the case @xmath87 . then either @xmath88 or @xmath89 . in the former case @xmath90",

    "furthermore , @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 is connected . in the latter case , when @xmath89 , we have that @xmath95 is connected and @xmath96 is disconnected . hence there",

    "we may assume , with no loss of generality , that @xmath103 . then @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath105 is an accumulation point of @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 as well .",
    "this yields that @xmath95 is disconnected , which is a contradiction .",

    "let us now show that both cases are attained by concrete examples . for totally disconnected graphs the example can be easily constructed .",
    "indeed , given @xmath108 any hamel basis of @xmath26 satisfying @xmath109 and let @xmath110 be a positive integer , we consider @xmath111 , the unique @xmath112-linear map which satisfies @xmath113 and @xmath114 for every @xmath115 . obviously @xmath116 is an @xmath0-monomial and @xmath117 .",
    "hence the graph of @xmath118 is totally disconnected .",
    "the existence of discontinuous @xmath0-monomials with connected graph follows from the existence of discontinuous additive functions @xmath1 with connected graph @xmath17 , a fact that was demonstrated by jones by using a nontrivial set theoretical argument on ordinals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 4 and 5 ) .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath1 is additive , discontinuous , and @xmath17 is connected .",
    "then @xmath119 is a discontinuous @xmath0-monomial function with connected graph , since the function @xmath120 given by @xmath121 is continuous and transforms the graph of @xmath7 onto the graph of @xmath122 .",

    "the following theorem may be also of interest :    [ @xmath127-chotomy property of additive functions ] [ d ] if @xmath2 is an additive function , then :    * there exists @xmath128 such that the connected component @xmath129 of @xmath17 which contains the point @xmath130 is a dense subgroup of an @xmath131-dimensional vector subspace of @xmath132 .",

    "* @xmath133 previous to introduce the main argument , it is necessary to recall two basic facts about topological groups . concretely ,",
    "if @xmath129 is a topological group , and @xmath134 denotes the identity component of @xmath129 ( i.e. , the biggest connected subset of @xmath129 which contains the identity @xmath135 ) , then @xmath134 is a closed normal subgroup of @xmath129 . furthermore , the elements of the quotient group @xmath136 are just the connected components of @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath2 an additive function and we set @xmath137 .",
    "obviously , the additivity of @xmath7 implies that @xmath17 is an additive subgroup of @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath129 be the connected component of @xmath17 which contains the zero element .",
    "then every connected component of @xmath17 results from @xmath129 by a translation .",
    "@xmath129 is a connected additive subgroup of @xmath132 .",
    "hence , its topological closure @xmath138 is also a connected subgroup of @xmath132 .",
    "it is known that the topological closure of any additive subgroup @xmath139 of @xmath132 satisfies @xmath140 for a certain vector subspace @xmath141 of @xmath132 and a discrete additive subgroup @xmath142 of @xmath132 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) for a proof of this fact ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath143 for a certain vector subspace @xmath141 of @xmath132 .",
    "hence every connected component of @xmath17 is the translation @xmath144 of a dense connected additive subgroup @xmath129 of the vector space @xmath141 for some @xmath145 .",

    "all the other cases represent an intermediate situation .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 is continuous , then @xmath125 is a @xmath148-dimensional vector subspace of @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath149 all cases described by theorem [ d ] can be constructed easily , since all functions @xmath2 of the form @xmath150 , with @xmath151 additive for each @xmath14 , are additive , and we can use the dichotomy result for each one of these functions @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath124    while searching in the literature for a demonstration of corollary [ dichotomy ] , the first author commented this question to professor lszl szkelyhidi , who also was unable to find the proof nowhere .",
    "then , he got a very nice independent proof of the result @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath154 we get the dichotomy result as follows ( this is szkelyhidi s idea ) : let @xmath155 denote the horizontal projection @xmath24 , and let @xmath156 be the projection of the connected component @xmath129 of @xmath17 which contains the zero element",
    ". then @xmath157 or @xmath158 , since the only connected subgroups of the real line are @xmath159 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus , if @xmath17 is not totally disconnected , then @xmath158 , which implies @xmath160 and hence , @xmath17 is connected .",
    "unfortunately , this simple proof seems to be very difficult to generalize for the case of monomial functions @xmath1 , since the graph of an @xmath0-monomial function is in general not an additive subgroup of @xmath126 .",
    "we hope this justifies to introduce the proof of theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "recently , almira and abu - helaiel characterized the topological closures of the graphs of monomial functions as follows ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.7 ) :      * if @xmath166 and @xmath167 , then @xmath168 . * if @xmath166 and @xmath169 , then @xmath170 if @xmath171 is an even number , and @xmath172 if @xmath173 is an odd number . in particular ,",

    "[ main ] let @xmath1 be a discontinuous @xmath0-monomial function and let @xmath161 and @xmath185 .",
    "then @xmath17 is connected if and only if @xmath17 intersects all continuum @xmath186 which touches two distinct vertical lines .      the proof follows the very same arguments used by jones @xcite in his original proof for the case of additive functions .",
    "the main difference is that , for additive functions , the closure of the graph of a discontinuous additive function is the all plane and , for monomials , the corresponding sets are those shown in theorem [ graph_monomials ] .",
    "assume that @xmath17 is not connected .",
    "then @xmath187 with @xmath188 open subsets of the real plane , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath192 is connected , since connected components of open subsets of @xmath126 are open sets .",
    "indeed , by making @xmath192 or @xmath141 bigger and bigger , just deleting properly some parts of the borders @xmath193 or @xmath194 , we can assume that both @xmath192 and @xmath141 are connected and share a common border @xmath195 .",
    "furthermore , this common frontier is necessarily connected , since the connectedness of the boundary of an open domain in @xmath126 is equivalent to the connectedness of its complement ( indeed , this result holds true for domains in @xmath196 for all @xmath197 @xcite ) .",
    "now , the density of @xmath17 in @xmath198 implies that @xmath199 . to prove this",

    "now we can use the characterization of the sets @xmath202 given in theorem [ graph_monomials ] to claim that @xmath209 contains a continuum which intersects two distinct vertical lines , since otherwise @xmath193 should contain the intersection of a vertical line with @xmath202 , a fact which leads to a contradiction , since @xmath17 is a graph and hence intersects all vertical lines .",
    "this proves that , if @xmath17 intersects all continuum @xmath186 which touches two distinct vertical lines , then @xmath17 is connected .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath17 is connected and let @xmath186 be a continuum which touches two distinct vertical lines .",

    "it follows that @xmath217 , since @xmath17 is connected , by hypothesis .",
    "hence , if @xmath17 is connected , then @xmath17 intersects every continuum @xmath186 which touches two distinct vertical lines .",
    "the implication @xmath17 connected implies @xmath218 connected is trivial .",
    "let us prove the other implication .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath218 is connected with @xmath219 , @xmath220 a @xmath221-monomial function .",
    "let @xmath210 be a continuum included into @xmath222 which touches two distinct vertical lines",
    ". then @xmath223 is a continuum , @xmath224 , and @xmath122 touches two distinct vertical lines .",

    "thanks to theorem [ graph_monomials ] we can also assume with no loss of generality that @xmath168 or @xmath228 for a certain @xmath169 , since the other cases have analogous proofs .",

    "hence we can assume that @xmath231x_0,x_1[\\times \\mathbb{r})\\cap\\gamma_f \\setminus k = u_k\\cup v_k,\\ ] ] with @xmath232 disjoint open subsets of @xmath202 , @xmath233 connected , and @xmath234 for certain @xmath235x_0,x_1[$ ] and @xmath33 .",
