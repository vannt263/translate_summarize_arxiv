    "the cpt theorem requires that the proton and antiproton ( @xmath8 ) lifetimes are equal .",
    "searches for proton decay have yielded lower limits on the proton lifetime @xmath9  yr  @xcite .",
    "hence , a search for @xmath8 decay with a short lifetime ( @xmath10 ) tests the cpt theorem . in this paper",
    "we describe a search for @xmath8 decay at the fermilab antiproton accumulator .",
    "cpt invariance is one of the most fundamental symmetries of modern physics . over the years",
    "there have been a variety of searches  @xcite for cpt violation based on comparing particle and antiparticle masses , lifetimes , and magnetic moments . for example , the proton and antiproton masses have been shown to be equal with a precision of a few parts in @xmath11  @xcite , whilst the particle and antiparticle masses in the neutral kaon system have been shown to be equal to about one part in @xmath12  @xcite . a search for @xmath8 decay complements these cpt tests by providing a search for cpt violation accompanied by a violation of baryon number .",
    "indeed , since the antiproton is the only long  lived antiparticle that could in principle decay into other known particles without violating charge conservation , a search for @xmath8 decay provides a unique test of the cpt theorem , and a unique test of the intrinsic stability of antimatter .",
    "the sensitivity of a @xmath8 decay search to the presence of a cpt violating interaction has been characterized  @xcite by considering a dimension-6 cpt - violating operator with characteristic mass scale @xmath13 .",
    "dimensional analysis then provides the estimate @xmath14 , yielding : @xmath15 hence , a search for @xmath8 decay with a lifetime of order 1  yr , for example , provides a test for cpt violation at a mass scale o(@xmath16 )  gev / c@xmath17 , which is well beyond the scale accessible at high energy colliders .    the most stringent lower limit on @xmath3 has been obtained  @xcite from a comparison of recent measurements of the cosmic ray @xmath8 flux  @xcite with predictions based on expectations for secondary production of antiprotons in the interstellar medium .",
    "the agreement between the observed and predicted rates implies that @xmath3 is not small compared to t/@xmath18 , where t is the @xmath8 confinement time within the galaxy ( @xmath19  yr ) and @xmath18 is the lorentz factor for the observed antiprotons . after taking into account the uncertainties on the relationship between the interstellar @xmath8 flux and the flux observed at the earth , at 90% c.l .",
    "the limit @xmath20  yr has been reported  @xcite .",
    "this indirect limit is not valid if current models of @xmath8 production , propagation , and interaction in the interstellar medium are seriously flawed .",
    "indeed , it has been claimed  @xcite that , within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model , if neutralino annihilations contribute significantly to the flux of cosmic ray antiprotons in the galactic halo , @xmath8 lifetimes as low as @xmath21  years can accommodate the current cosmic ray data .",
    "laboratory searches for @xmath8 decay have , to date , provided less stringent limits on @xmath3 .",
    "however , these limits do not suffer from large model dependent uncertainties .",
    "the most stringent published laboratory limit on inclusive @xmath8 decay has been obtained from a measurement of the containment lifetime of @xmath22 antiprotons stored in an ion trap , yielding @xmath23  months  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of laboratory @xmath8 decay searches can be dramatically improved by looking for explicit @xmath8 decay modes at an antiproton storage ring .",
    "angular momentum conservation requires that a decaying @xmath8 would produce a fermion ( electron , muon , or neutrino ) in the final state .",
    "hence , there are only a limited number of potential decay modes .",
    "a search for explicit @xmath8 decay modes with an electron in the final state was made by the apex test experiment ( t861 ) at the fermilab antiproton accumulator .",

    "we give a more detailed description of our limits on @xmath8 decay modes with a muon in the final state , and describe new results from a search for @xmath8 decay modes with an electron in the final state .",

    "the apex detector was located in a 15.9  m straight section of the fermilab antiproton accumulator ring , which has a circumference of 474  m. the detector was designed to identify @xmath8 decays within a short 3.7  m long section of the ring , and was optimized to detect a single energetic charged track ( electron or muon ) , originating from the beam , and accompanied by one or more neutral pions or photons .",
    "a schematic of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ detector_fig ] . in the following",
    "we give a brief description of the main detector components relevant to the analysis described in this paper .",
    "a more detailed description can be found in ref .",
    "the apex detector consisted of the following :    \\(i ) a 3.7  m long evacuated decay tank operated at @xmath30  torr .",
    "the vacuum was maintained by a roughing pump , an ion diffusion pump , and twelve titanium sublimation filaments .",
    "the tank was designed to minimize the residual gas within the fiducial volume of the experiment , and hence minimize backgrounds from beam  gas interactions .",
    "the downstream section of the tank consists of a 96  cm diameter cylindrical shell supporting a 1.2  mm thick ( 0.073 radiation lengths ) stainless steel window .",
    "\\(ii ) a movable tungsten wire target at the upstream end of the tank ( @xmath31 = 0 where , in the apex coordinate system , @xmath31 is measured in the direction of the antiproton beam ) .",
    "the target could be inserted into the beam halo to produce a localized source of particles for aligning and calibrating the detector .",
    "\\(iii ) an upstream veto system consisting of horizontal and vertical scintillation counters arranged around the 10  cm diameter beam pipe immediately upstream of the tank and target .",
    "the counters covered a area normal to the beam direction , and were used to reject tracks from upstream interactions .",
    "\\(iv ) three planes of horizontal and three planes of vertical scintillation counters downstream of the tank .",
    "each plane consisted of two @xmath32  @xmath33 counters .",
    "the last planes of horizontal and vertical counters were downstream of a 2.3 radiation length lead wall , providing a preradiator to aid in identifying electrons and photons .",
    "the remaining counter planes were upstream of the lead , and provided pulse height information used to count the number of charged particles in an event ( @xmath34 counters ) .",
    "the measured pulse height distribution arising from the passage of minimum ionizing particles ( mips ) through the @xmath34 counters is well described by a geant monte carlo simulation in which the yield is 37 photoelectrons per mip . the predicted efficiency for a minimum ionizing particle to produce a counter signal in excess of a 0.5  mip threshold is 97% .",
    "\\(v ) a lead  scintillator sampling electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite constructed from 144 rectangular @xmath35  cm@xmath17 modules that are 14.7 radiation lengths deep .",
    "the modules were arranged in a @xmath37 array with 6 modules removed from each of the four corners , and the central module removed to allow passage of the beam pipe ( fig .",
    "[ trigger_quads ] ) .",
    "each module was read out with one 5.1  cm diameter photomultiplier .",
    "an led pulser system enabled the stability of the photomultiplier gains for each module to be monitored .",
    "the calorimeter was calibrated by measuring the response to minimum ionizing tracks and reconstructing @xmath38 and @xmath39 mass peaks using data samples recorded with the calibration target inserted into the beam halo .",
    "the measured mass peaks have fractional rms widths given by @xmath40/m  @xmath41 for cluster pairs in the energy range of interest for the experiment .",
    "this mass resolution is dominated by the energy resolution of the calorimeter .",
    "\\(vi ) a tail catcher ( tc ) downstream of the calorimeter consisting of a 20  cm deep lead wall followed by planes of horizontal and vertical scintillation counters .",
    "\\(vii ) a limited - acceptance muon telescope ( mt ) , 10 nuclear interaction lengths deep , located downstream of the tc , and aligned to point towards the center of the decay tank .",
    "the mt consists of a sandwich of five iron plates and five @xmath42  cm@xmath17 scintillation counters .",
    "the mt was used to identify charged particles that penetrate through several interaction lengths of material ( muon candidates ) .",
    "\\(viii ) a tracking system consisting of three planes of horizontal and three planes of vertical 2  mm diameter scintillating fibers downstream of the tank and upstream of the preradiator lead .",
    "the fibers were measured to yield about 9 photoelectrons for a traversing minimum ionizing particle , and were read out using 12-stage hamamatsu multianode photomultipliers .",
    "these detectors provided three space points along the track trajectory with typical residuals of 620  @xmath43 m in the directions transverse to the beam direction .",
    "this resolution enabled the origin of tracks emerging from the decay tank to be reconstructed with an rms precision given by @xmath44  cm .",
    "the average single  hit efficiency for a minimum ionizing particle passing through a tracking plane was 85% .",
    "the measured track reconstruction efficiency , for a sample of events that are consistent with having one minimum ionizing particle passing through the @xmath34 planes and the mt , is @xmath45% .",
    "the apex experiment took data during the april - july 1995 fermilab tevatron collider running period at times when there were typically @xmath46 antiprotons circulating in the accumulator ring with a central @xmath8 momentum of @xmath47  gev / c ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "apex ran parasitically to the tevatron collider program . due to increased background interactions",
    "when antiprotons were being stacked in the accumulator , data were only taken during periods when stacking was not taking place .",
    "such times occurred during the short period ( typically 90  minutes ) before daily injection of antiprotons into the tevatron , or at times when the collider complex was not running due to maintenance or repairs .",
    "a measure of the sensitivity of the apex data sample is given by : @xmath49 where n@xmath50 is the number of circulating antiprotons at time @xmath51 , the integral is over the live - time of the experiment , and the uncertainty arises from the precision with which the time dependent beam current was recorded . hence , if @xmath52  years then on average 0.63 antiproton decays would have occurred somewhere within the accumulator during the live - time of the experiment .",
    "energetic particles passing through the detector during accumulator operation predominantly arise from interactions of the @xmath8 beam with the residual gas in the decay tank or with material surrounding the beam .",
    "to suppress these backgrounds , and select candidate and decays , signals from the calorimeter and the scintillation counters were used to form muon and electron triggers .      to search for muonic",
    "@xmath8 decays , data were recorded with a muon trigger that required a coincidence between at least two of the five mt scintillation counters .",
    "these triggers were eliminated if they were in coincidence with a signal in one or more of the upstream veto counters indicating the presence of an interaction upstream of the decay tank .",
    "this loose trigger resulted in 1.2 @xmath53 events being recorded with a typical trigger rate of @xmath54  hz .",
    "these events predominantly arise from background interactions in which the coincident mt counter signals are produced by traversing muons coming from charged pion decays , or by hadronic showers not contained in the calorimeter and tc .      to search for electronic @xmath8 decays ,",
    "data were recorded with three complementary triggers : ( i ) an @xmath55 trigger designed to select events consistent with a two - body @xmath8 decay that results in the deposition of energy in two diagonally opposite quadrants of the calorimeter .",
    "the calorimeter cell groupings into four trigger quadrants are shown in fig .",
    "[ trigger_quads ] .",
    "the trigger required the summed signals in each of two diagonally opposite quadrants to exceed a threshold that was set equal to about 2  gev ; ( ii ) an @xmath56 trigger designed to select @xmath8 decays in which all of the decay products deposit approximately all of their energy within the calorimeter .",
    "this would result in a total calorimeter energy deposition @xmath56 close to the beam energy .",
    "the trigger therefore required the summed signals from all of the calorimeter cells to exceed a threshold that was set equal to about 7  gev ; and ( iii ) an @xmath57 trigger which required signals in the scintillators of the first two @xmath34 planes consistent with the passage of a mip , a signal in the corresponding preradiator scintillators exceeding about 1.5 mips , and a signal in the corresponding calorimeter quadrant exceeding a summed energy threshold set equal to about 5  gev .",
    "all three triggers were combined with a signal from the upstream veto counters , used in anti - coincidence to suppress events from upstream interactions .",
    "the typical data taking rates from background events satisfying the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 trigger requirements were respectively 3  hz , 9  hz , and 8  hz when there were @xmath46 antiprotons circulating in the accumulator .",
    "the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 triggers resulted in a data sample of 37.8  million events recorded to tape for further analysis .",
    "a number of additional triggers were used , either during normal data taking or during special running periods , to collect data for monitoring and calibrating the detector .",
    "three of these triggers provided calibration data samples that were specially important for the analysis : ( 1 ) a very low threshold rate limited calorimeter trigger ( @xmath58  mev ) that recorded events with minimal bias continuously during normal running .",
    "dedicated minimal bias data samples were also taken during extended periods when there was a low intensity @xmath8 current ( corresponding to @xmath59 stored antiprotons ) in the accumulator ; ( 2 ) a traversing charged track trigger that required a coincidence between the upstream veto counters and the tc counters .",
    "this trigger provided a sample of mips passing through the calorimeter ; and ( 3 ) low threshold ( @xmath60  gev ) and high threshold ( @xmath61  gev ) calorimeter triggers used during special periods during which the calibration target was inserted into the beam halo .",
    "this provided tracks coming from a known origin which facilitated the relative alignment of the tracking planes .",
    "these data also provided a sample of localized interactions which enabled the reconstruction of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 peaks used to define the calorimeter calibration .",
    "we begin with the sample of 1.2 @xmath53 events recorded with the muon trigger .",
    "offline , after final calibration of the scintillation counters , the upstream veto counter requirement was re - applied using a more stringent threshold .",
    "this reduced the data sample to 1.1 @xmath53 events .",
    "the remaining backgrounds can be further suppressed by requiring that ( a ) the scintillation counter and scintillating fiber tracker signals are consistent with the presence of a minimum ionizing charged track that points back to the beam trajectory within the decay tank and that points forward to a pattern of minimum ionizing energy depositions within the mt counters , and ( b ) an event topology and kinematics that is consistent with the decay @xmath8  @xmath62 . in the following ,",
    "we consider first the simplest decay channel @xmath8  @xmath63 , and then describe the search for more complicated decay modes .      to select events consistent with the decay @xmath8",
    "@xmath65 we begin by requiring that : ( i ) at least four of the five mt counters be above threshold ( @xmath66 events ) , and ( ii ) there be one and only one reconstructed track that extrapolates to the mt counters within the expected uncertainty due to multiple scattering , and also extrapolates back to the beam orbit with a point of closest approach within the fiducial volume of the decay tank ( @xmath67  cm ) and with an impact parameter  @xcite less than 1  cm ( 416 events ) . since a @xmath68 decay would result in events in which an energetic photon is produced coplanar with the muon ( i.e. traveling within the plane defined by the muon and the incoming beam direction ) , we next require that ( iii ) there be at least one neutral cluster  @xcite in the calorimeter ( 209 events ) that is coplanar with the muon candidate ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the data sample is reduced to 14 events . the observed neutral cluster energy distribution for these events is compared in fig .",

    "we conclude that there is no evidence for a signal .      to set a limit on @xmath3/b(@xmath71 )",

    "the detector simulation includes a full description of the detector geometry , and correctly describes the calorimeter , tracker , and scintillation counter responses ( de / dx , mt ) measured using calibration data , together with the measured performance of the muon trigger .",
    "further details can be found in ref .",
    "the efficiency @xmath78 was obtained by generating @xmath88 decays uniformly along the beam orbit within the decay tank , and applying the trigger and data selection requirements to the simulated events .",
    "the geometrical efficiency of the detector and trigger is negligible for decays occurring outside of the tank .",
    "we obtain @xmath89 , where the uncertainty on @xmath78 arises from the systematic uncertainties on the muon trigger counter threshold calibration , the calorimeter energy scale , and the track reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the contributions to @xmath90 arising from the uncertainties on the muon trigger counter threshold calibration and the calorimeter energy scale are , respectively , @xmath91% and @xmath92% .",
    "these uncertainties have been evaluated by analyzing geant monte carlo @xmath68 samples in which the simulated trigger calibration and the calorimeter energy scale have been changed by @xmath93  standard deviation .",

    "we obtain the result  @xcite @xmath96 @xmath97  yr ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "finally , we note that although our limit is insensitive to the exact value of @xmath72 , the dependence of the final result on the position of this last cut is somewhat unsatisfying .",
    "hence , to verify our result , we have also used the more complicated statistical method described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this alternative statistical analysis",
    "all of the events in the final ( @xmath72 ) distribution are retained , and use is made of how  signal  like \" the position of each event is in the final distribution . using this method",
    "we obtain a limit on @xmath98 that is consistent with our quoted result .",
    "now consider the two  body decays @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , and the three  body decay @xmath105 .",
