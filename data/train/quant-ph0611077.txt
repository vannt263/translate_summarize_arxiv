    "this generic denomination refers to qubit realizations that involve the charge  @xcite or the flux  @xcite degree of freedom in superconducting devices ( also see references  @xcite ) .",
    "the coherent coupling of two charge qubits and the implementation of conditional gate operations  @xcite , as well as the coupling of two flux qubits  @xcite , have been demonstrated experimentally , and there is currently an increasing activity in the field .",

    "it needs to be realised however that the technological barriers for full scale quantum computation are formidable .",
    "thus there is a need for intermediate experiments that are interesting and non - trivial yet less demanding than implementing quantum computation .",
    "the exploration of many - body dynamics provides such a platform .",
    "crucially , the fabrication of arrays that involve @xmath2 josephson qubits has already been achieved in the laboratory  @xcite , and one of our aims in the present work is to make realistic predictions about their dynamical entanglement properties . in order to do so",

    "note , however , that the precise sources of @xmath3-type noise have yet to be identified and that the spin - boson formalism ceases to be valid in the limit of strong coupling to environmental fluctuators @xcite .",
    "moreover , the influence of noise on @xmath4 coupled josephson qubits remains largely unexplored @xcite . in relation to quantum information processing , it is important to characterise the necessary conditions for preserving coherence in a noisy environment before further steps can be taken in the direction of designing error correction schemes and ( subsequently ) fault tolerant superconducting architectures .    in this paper",
    "we formulate an initial model for josephson - qubit chains in realistic environments , taking into account the most common sources of noise .",
    "first we analyse the quantum dynamics in ideal conditions and then discuss the modifications one should expect when ( i ) disorder is taken into account and ( ii ) the system couples linearly to an environment that is modelled as a bath of harmonic oscillators , as detailed in section 4 . to corroborate our view that the findings for shorter chains are generic , we also perform simulations for longer chains with @xmath5 qubits .",
    "the simulations are performed using a time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique @xcite , employing a code previously developed and tested in @xcite .",

    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "we test the performance of these concepts in the present case and find that , using some optimisation , they provide very accurate estimates for the amount of entanglement present in the system .",
    "we consider an open chain of @xmath11 qubits with nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote pauli matrices for qubit @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the strength of the coupling between nearest neighbours @xmath16 ( we set @xmath17 throughout ) .",
    "the control parameters are the energy bias @xmath18 and the tunnelling splitting @xmath19 .",
    "we consider , as an example , charge qubits  @xcite , in which case we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the charging energy , @xmath23 is the josephson energy , and @xmath24 is the gate charge , which is controlled by the gate capacitance @xmath25 and voltage @xmath26 .",

    "we consider purely capacitive coupling between the charge qubits  @xcite , and hence the @xmath30 interaction dominates .",
    "we assume ( this condition will be relaxed later on ) that the effective charge number of each qubit is @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) so that it is operated at the so - called degeneracy point @xcite . as it will become clear later",
    ", this choice can be advantageous when trying to minimise the impact of noise .",
    "a feasible way to achieve generation of entanglement in coupled many - body systems is non - adiabatic switching of interactions as demonstrated in harmonic chains @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage of only requiring moderate control over the parameters of individual subsystems . in our study here",
    "we will quantify the amount of entanglement that can be obtained in this way for the model equation ( [ h_nq ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will assume that the interqubit couplings @xmath15 are initially zero and are then non - adiabatically switched to a finite value .",
    "if one were indeed able to switch off the interqubit couplings completely , then at absolute zero temperature each qubit would be prepared in its ground state @xmath33 ( when operated at its optimal point , where @xmath34 ) .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian of equation ( [ h_nq ] ) for @xmath35 is the uncorrelated state @xmath36 where @xmath37 denote the eigenstates of @xmath38 corresponding to zero or one extra cooper pair in the superconducting box .",
    "we will thus study the _ generation _ of entanglement by evolving the initial state of equation ( [ psi ] ) according to the hamiltonian ( [ h_nq ] ) with @xmath39 .",
    "we will also study the _ propagation _ of entanglement @xcite by assuming that our initial state is @xmath40 in this case , the interactions @xmath15 are initially zero but a bell state @xmath41 has been created for the first two qubits .",
    "again , the interactions are instantaneously switched on to a finite value and the evolution according to the hamiltonian ( [ h_nq ] ) with @xmath39 is studied .",
    "the bell state @xmath41 , shared between the first two qubits in the chain , is maximally entangled .",
    "we note that there is also entanglement generation while the quantum correlations of @xmath41 propagate along the chain .",
    "we discuss below the effect of deviations in these initial conditions , due to non - vanishing initial interactions or static disorder .",
    "we begin by calculating the time - evolution of the logarithmic negativity of equation ( [ log_neg ] ) for qubit pairs in ideal conditions . in figure [ fig_1 ]",
    "we show the result for a chain of @xmath42 qubits with the initial state @xmath43 of equation ( [ psi ] ) and parameters @xmath44 . due to the geometry of the setup , symmetric pairs of qubits , such as @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 possess the same amount of entanglement .",
    "it is possible to create long - range entanglement , even between the first and last qubit in the chain ( at @xmath47 which corresponds to about @xmath48 ) . by comparing and contrasting the four panels in figure 1",
    "we can see that there is a characteristic ` collapse - and - revival ' behaviour : when the entanglement of nearest or next - nearest neighbours is constant or vanishing , the entanglement of distant qubits becomes maximal ( e.g. , at @xmath49 ) .",
    "due to the finite length of the chain we find that neither the time when a pair of qubits becomes entangled for the first time , nor the time when the first entanglement maximum occurs , are proportional to the distance between the qubits .",
    "the characteristic speed at which the distance of pairwise entanglement is expected to grow is thus masked by finite size effects , in our study .",
    "entanglement propagation for this chain in ideal conditions is considered later ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure [ fig_5 ] ) .    _ deviations in initial conditions : _ in practice , it is not quite possible to switch off the interqubit couplings completely . to take this into account",
    "we have considered the case when there is initially some small coupling between the qubits , @xmath50 , and the initial state of the system is the ground state of @xmath51 .",
    "then the ground state evolves according to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "in this case we obtain very similar results with those presented in figure [ fig_1 ] for the ideal case ( clearly , for @xmath54 we recover the results of the ideal case ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath55 the relative maxima deviate by less than @xmath56 , and there is initially very little entanglement in the system ( e.g. , the logarithmic negativity for the first two qubits in the chain at @xmath57 is less than @xmath58 ) .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath59 the relative maxima can deviate by up to @xmath60 and the initial entanglement in the chain is much more evident ( e.g. , @xmath61 at @xmath57 for the same parameters ) .",
    "we will revisit this case shortly , after we have introduced disorder and noise into the system ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure [ fig_4 ] ) .    another interesting question relating to the initial preparation concerns the state of the chain at thermal equilibrium . in particular",
    ", we would like to know if we would obtain similar results when the state of the system at @xmath57 is the thermal equilibrium state , and also how close are the thermal and ground states of the system described by the hamiltonian @xmath62 of equation ( [ h_nq ] ) .",
    "we have therefore assumed that the initial state of the chain is the thermal equilibrium state @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 $ ] , and there is initial coupling , @xmath66 , between the qubits . the coupling is then switched on to its final value @xmath67 at @xmath57 . in this case",
    "we have found that for low temperatures ( @xmath68 ) the entanglement dynamics of the chain is very similar with that obtained by evolving the ground state ( the relative deviations are less than @xmath69 ) for the same value of @xmath66 . in order to compare the thermal equilibrium state @xmath70 with the ground state @xmath71 of @xmath51 we have calculated the fidelity @xmath72 for various values of the temperature ( with fixed @xmath73 ) . we have found that for temperatures @xmath74 the fidelity is between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and hence the two states are very close indeed for these temperatures . between @xmath77 and @xmath78 the thermal equilibrium state and the ground state begin to differ ( their fidelity slowly drops to 0.9 as the temperature",

    "note that symmetric qubit pairs , such as ( 1,2 ) and ( 7,8 ) , generate the same entanglement and hence are represented by the same line .",
    "a ` collapse - and - revival ' pattern emerges in the entanglement oscillations , as seen from a comparison of the different panels .",
    "[ fig_1],width=529 ]",
    "in any experimental situation the initial preparation will also suffer from errors in the control parameters @xmath80 . as a result , the homogeneity of the chain will be broken .",
    "we can simulate the effect by letting the parameters take random , but static , values in the interval @xmath81 $ ] , where @xmath82 quantifies the disorder .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig_2](a ) , where we plot @xmath83 for the pair @xmath45 in the ideal ( solid line ) and imperfect scenario ( broken line ) , where the disorder in @xmath19 and @xmath15 is @xmath84 .",
    "averaging over @xmath85 runs , we have found that disorder with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 causes relative fluctuations of the maximal entanglement equal to @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "therefore for disorder which is less than @xmath69 ( the upper bound in state - of - the - art experiments @xcite ) the entanglement in the system changes marginally , on average .",
    "this is indeed true for the noisy scenario also , as shown in the following section .",
    "it is noted that disorder has recently been studied in related , but different , contexts in @xcite .     in the presence of ( a ) disorder and ( b ) noise , which is characterised by a decay rate @xmath92 at absolute zero temperature .",

    "thus the largest value that can be achieved for @xmath216 is given by @xmath217 . ]    as an example , in figure [ correlfig ] , the entanglement between qubits 10 and 11 is @xmath218 at @xmath219 . while @xmath220 at this point , we obtained @xmath221 for the optimal choice of axes @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 . the optimal choice of axes depends on time .",

    "we have studied the dynamics of entanglement in qubit chains influenced by noise and static disorder .",
    "this study provides useful analysis for interesting experiments with quantum devices that in the long term may be suitable for the implementation of quantum computing .",
    "we have considered an experimentally interesting implementation using josephson charge qubits with capacitive interactions between nearest neighbours .",
    "we have found that static disorder less than @xmath69 ( i.e. , the current experimental upper bound ) does not affect the entanglement dynamics substantially .",
    "by contrast , the influence of environmental noise , modelled here as a set of independent harmonic oscillator baths of arbitrary spectral density , is much more pronounced : it reduces long - range correlations and decreases the magnitude of the achievable bipartite entanglement . for typical operating temperatures ,",
    "the influence of noise on the chain dynamics at short times and in the steady - state can be crucially distinct ; while the entanglement amplitudes in the initial transient decrease monotonically with the noise strength , the steady - state response is non - monotonic .",
    "therefore , we have identified parameter regimes in which the bipartite entanglement increases as a result of amplifying the noise .",
    "we have found agreement between the behaviour of entanglement in short ( @xmath223 ) and long ( @xmath5 ) chains .",
    "the present results are encouraging from the experimental point of view as they suggest that ( a ) both short- and long - range entanglement can be generated and propagated under suitable laboratory conditions , and ( b ) lower bounds can be placed on the entanglement from the measurement of a few general observables .",
    "we are grateful to rosario fazio , hans mooij and phil meeson for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the epsrc - irc on quantum information and ep / d065305/1 , the eu via the integrated project qap ( ` qubit applications ' ) and the royal society .",

    "here we outline the concept proposed in @xcite and its adaption to our application . for the matrix product state simulation of mixed state dynamics , the density matrix for @xmath11 qubits",
    "is expanded in a basis of matrices formed by direct products of the elementary matrices @xmath224 hence the matrices forming the basis for @xmath11 qubits are of the form @xmath225 the expansion of the density matrix @xmath202 is now written in terms of products of matrices in the following way : @xmath226 } \\cdot \\lambda_1 \\cdot \\gamma_2^{[s_2 ] } \\cdot \\lambda_2 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\lambda_{n-1 } \\cdot \\gamma_n^{[s_n ] } \\ : \\epsilon_{s_1 } \\otimes \\epsilon_{s_2 } \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\epsilon_{s_n}\\ ] ] where ` @xmath227 ' denotes matrix multiplication . here , each @xmath228}$ ] ( @xmath229 ) is a row vector of length @xmath230 , each @xmath231}$ ] is a column vector of length @xmath230 , each @xmath232}$ ] ( @xmath233 ) is a @xmath234 matrix and each @xmath235 is a diagonal @xmath234 matrix .",
    "the structure of the matrices @xmath92 and @xmath236 is the same as in the matrix product representation of pure states and the tebd - algorithm @xcite can be employed for the simulation of the dynamics .",
    "in contrast to pure states , the matrix elements of the @xmath235 for mixed states can however no longer be interpreted as the schmidt coefficients of the respective decomposition .",
