    "combining the data of all the available observations and , in particular , the data of the precise experiments @xcite , we now know that most of the matter in the universe is dark , i.e. exotic and non baryonic .",
    "furthermore there exists firm indirect evidence for a halo of dark matter in galaxies from the observed rotational curves , see e.g the review @xcite .",
    "it is , however , essential to directly detect any such dark matter , a task , which , of course , depends on the nature of the dark matter constituents or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) and their interactions . since the wimps are expected to be extremely non relativistic , with average kinetic energy @xmath0 , they are not likely to excite the nucleus .",
    "so , they can be directly detected mainly via the recoiling of the target nucleus ( a , z ) following the wimp - nucleus scattering .",
    "the event rate for such a process can be computed from the following ingredients @xcite : i ) the elementary wimp - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "this most important parameter will not , however , be the subject of the present work .",
    "we will adopt the view that it can be extracted from the data of event rates , if and when such data become available .",
    "ii ) knowledge of the relevant nuclear matrix elements obtained with as reliable as possible many body nuclear wave functions . in the present work",
    "we will limit ourselves to elastic wimp - nucleus scattering and , thus , only the nuclear form factor is needed .",
    "iii ) knowledge of the wimp density in our vicinity and its velocity distribution . in the standard nuclear recoil experiments , first proposed more than 30 years ago @xcite , one has to face the problem that the reaction of interest does not have a characteristic feature to distinguish it from the background .",
    "so for the expected low counting rates the background is a formidable problem . some special features of the wimp - nuclear interaction can be exploited to reduce the background problems .",
    "such as :    \\i ) the modulation effect .",
    "this yields a periodic signal due to the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "this effect , also proposed a long time ago @xcite and subsequently studied by many authors @xcite , depends on the assumed velocity distribution . in the standard maxwell boltzmann",
    "( m - b ) distribution for wimps in the galactic halo the modulation amplitude , depending on the mechanism of the reaction as well as on the target and the wimp mass , is small .",
    "the relative amplitude becomes even smaller than @xmath1 in the case of low detector energy cut off @xcite .",
    "ii ) backward - forward asymmetry expected in directional experiments , i.e. experiments in which the direction of the recoiling nucleus is also observed .",
    "such an asymmetry has also been predicted a long time ago @xcite , but it has not yet been exploited , since such experiments have been considered very difficult to perform .",
    "some progress has , however , recently been made in this direction and the relevant experiments now appear feasible @xcite . in such experiments the event rate and its modulation",
    "depend on the direction of observation .",
    "an essential ingredient in direct wimp detection is the wimp density in our vicinity and , especially , the wimp velocity distribution .",
    "the dark matter in the solar neighborhood is commonly assumed to be smoothly distributed in space and to have a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "some of the calculations have considered various forms of phenomenological non symmetric velocity distributions @xcite and some of them even more exotic dark matter flows like the late infall of dark matter into the galaxy , i.e caustic rings @xcite and sagittarius dark matter @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above models very recently it was found that the velocity distributions measured in high resolution numerical simulations exhibit deviations from the standard maxwell - boltzmann assumption , especially at large velocities @xcite .",
    "furthermore a distinction was made between a velocity structure that is spatially localized , such as streams @xcite , and that which is spatially homogenized , which was designated as `` debris flow '' @xcite .",
    "both streams and debris flows arise from the disruption of satellites that fall into the milky way , but differ in the relative amount of phase - mixing that they have undergone .",
    "implications of streams @xcite and , more recently , of the debris flows in direct dark matter searches have been considered by kuhlen , lisanti and spergel @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will discuss in some detail the effect of these debris flows@xcite on the event rates of direct dark matter experiments for a variety of targets such as those employed in xenon10 @xcite , xenon100 @xcite , xmass @xcite , zeplin @xcite , panda - x @xcite , lux @xcite , cdms @xcite , cogent @xcite , edelweiss @xcite , dama @xcite , kims @xcite and picasso @xcite .",
    "we will also study the effect of these flows on the time variation of the relevant rates due to the annual motion of the earth @xcite ( modulation effect ) as a function of the energy transfer and the wimp mass and compare them with the standard m - b distribution .",
    "the effects of debris flows in directional experiments will be studied elsewhere .",
    "before calculating the direct detection event rate , we will first deal with the wimp velocity distribution . to this end",
    "we will follow the steps :    * one starts with such distribution in the galactic frame .",
    "* one transforms to the local coordinate system : + _ s+(-+_s ) , y= [ eq : vlocal ] with @xmath2 , @xmath3 a unit vector in the sun s direction of motion , @xmath4 a unit vector radially out of the galaxy in our position and @xmath5 .",
    "the last term in the first expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vlocal ] ) corresponds to the motion of the earth around the sun with @xmath6 being the ratio of modulus of the earth s velocity around the sun divided by the sun s velocity around the center of the galaxy , i.e. @xmath7km / s and @xmath8 .",
    "the above formula assumes that the motion of both the sun around the galaxy and of the earth around the sun are uniformly circular .",
    "the exact orbits are , of course , more complicated @xcite , but such deviations are not expected to significantly modify our results . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vlocal ] ) @xmath9 is the phase of the earth ( @xmath10 around june 3nd ) , where @xmath11 is the fraction of the year . ] .",
    "* one integrates the velocity distribution over the angles and the result is multiplied by the velocity @xmath12 due to the wimp flux . *",
    "the result is integrated from a minimum value @xmath13 to the maximum allowed velocity @xmath14 . in general , the escape velocity @xmath15 in our galaxy is estimated to be in the range 550km",
    "/ s@xmath16km / s . in our calculations we assumed for the m - b distribution @xmath17km / s ,",
    "even though the value@xcite of 550 km / s , which results from an analysis of data from the rave survey @xcite , would have been more appropriate .",
    "the obtained results are not sensitive to this value .",
    "@xmath13 is a suitable parametrization in terms of the recoil energy and the target parameters , namely : _",
    "min= where @xmath18 is the mass of the nucleus , @xmath19 is the reduced mass of the wimp - nucleus system and @xmath20 is the energy transfer to the nucleus .    with the above procedure",
    "one obtains the quantity @xmath21 . for the m - b distribution in the local frame",
    "it is defined as follows : g(_min,_e())=__min^_maxe^-(^2 + 2 . _",

    "( [ eq : vlocal ] ) ) . the above upper",
    "cut off value in the m - b is usually put in by hand .",
    "such a cut off comes in naturally , however , in the case of velocity distributions obtained from the halo wimp mass density in the eddington approach @xcite , which , in certain models , resemble a m - b distribution @xcite .",
    "its precise value is not , however , important for the results of the present paper ( see fig .",

    "as we shall see below , there is an additional dependence of the rates on @xmath20 coming from the nuclear form factor .    at earth - frame velocities greater than 450 km / s , debris flow comprises more than half of the dark matter at the sun s location , and up to @xmath24 at even higher velocities @xcite .",
    "the combination of debris flows and standard m - b is provided by the relative density fraction @xmath25 of the via lactea 2 particles tagged as debris flows in the radial shell @xmath26 kpc compared to the total number of particles in the simulation from 7.5 to 9.5 kpc . in the vl2 simulation it is well fitted @xcite by a gauss error function : ( x)=0.22 + 0.34 ( ( x - ) + 1 ) [ eq : epsilonmix ] this function is exhibited in fig .",

    "we show the same quantities using the helm type form factor , indicated by the thick solid and long - dashed curves for @xmath43i and @xmath44ge respectively . for lighter targets",
    "the effect of the form factor is small .",

    "it coincides with the ratio @xmath48 , i.e. it is independent of the nuclear form factor and depends only on the reduced mass and the velocity distribution .",

    "[ fig : ffsq ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of debris flows makes a small contribution at very low energy transfers .",
    "as expected @xcite , it tends to be favored compared to the m - b distribution as the recoil energy increases .",
    "this is particularly true for small wimp - nucleus reduced mass ( see figs [ fig : drdq127 ] , [ fig : drdq23 ] and [ fig : drdq73 ] ) .",
    "one does not see any particular signature in the shape of the resulting curve , simply all the differential rates fall with the energy transfer .",
    "one , however , observes an interesting pattern concerning the modulation amplitude , which affects time varying ( modulated ) part of the rate ( see figs [ fig : dhdq127 ] , [ fig : dhdq23 ] and [ fig : dhdq73 ] ) .",
    "we first focus on the small recoil energy region . here",
    "we note that the sign of the modulation amplitude due to the flows is opposite to that of the m - b distribution for low reduced mass . for a light target",
    "this occurs almost with any wimp mass and extends up to energies of 100 kev .",
    "thus the use of a light target nucleus , like @xmath49f employed by picasso @xcite with the claimed achievement of 1.7 kev threshold , assuming that they will be able to detect the time variation of the rate , may differentiate between standard dark matter and flows .",
    "this can also be achieved by experiments involving heavier targets , like @xmath43i or @xmath56xe , or @xmath44ge , assuming a threshold of less than 1 kev , but , unfortunately , only if the , yet unknown , wimp mass happens to be sufficiently small .",
    "the low mass target also exhibits interesting behavior at the high recoil energy region .",
    "indeed the modulation amplitude due to the flows increases and becomes fairly large and positive , while that for the m - b distribution tends to decrease and becomes quite small .",
    "again this behavior is pretty much independent of the wimp mass . on the other hand , for medium mass or heavy targets we expect a similar behavior only in the case of light wimps .",
    "+ in view of the above , it seems to us that experiments on light targets , assuming that they overcome the fact that the expected coherent rates are smaller , may provide more information than simply challenging or confirming the claims of seasonal modulations by the dama @xcite and cogent @xcite experiments .",
    "we also expect , that the behavior of the relative modulation amplitude in the case of the spin contribution will be similar to that found here for the coherent rates .",
    "then , the light odd targets are not disfavored from this point of view .    before concluding this section",
    ", we should mention that , even though we have exhibited in our figures the modulation amplitude in absolute units ( events per kg target per year ) , to get the time variation of the rate one should multiply this amplitude with @xmath30 . as we have already mentioned , the location of the maximum depends on the sign of this amplitude .    the above results , as we will see in the next section , have important implications on the total event rates .",

    "for completeness and comparison , we will briefly present our results on the total rates . integrating the differential rates discussed in the previous section we obtain the total rate @xmath58 by adding the corresponding time averaged rate @xmath59 and the total modulated rate @xmath60 , i.e. : r = r_0+= ( ) ^2 a^2 _",

    "the average event rate attains the maximum value of 30 events per kg of target per year at a wimp mass of 30 gev , while for heavy wimps it eventually falls to about 5 kg / y at 500 gev . for an medium weight target",
    "we get 15 kg / y at 30 gev , with an asymptotic value of 4 kg / y . for a light target the",
    "maximum becomes 2.5 kg / y at 20 gev .",
    "again the asymptotic value at 500 gev is about 1/5 of the possible maximum .",
    "this behavior of @xmath59 for wimps of large mass is easily understood by noting that the parameter @xmath66 essentially depends on the reduced mass .",
    "the rate @xmath59 , however , contains an additional mass dependence , inversely proportional to the wimp mass , arising in going from the wimp density in our vicinity to the number density .",
    "since for heavy wimps the reduced mass essentially becomes constant , equal to the target nuclear mass , the total rate , to a good approximation , falls in this case inversely proportional to the wimp mass .",
    "similarly @xmath64 , being the ratio of two quantities , depends only on the reduced mass and , thus , becomes essentially constant in the high wimp mass region .",
    "it is clear that , as far as the time averaged rates @xmath59 are concerned , the debris flows do not exhibit any characteristic signature to differentiate them from the standard m - b distribution .",
    "the relative modulation amplitude @xmath64 , however , exhibits a very interesting feature , namely , if caused by the flows themselves , it is negative for all targets , even for the light ones , and in the entire wimp mass range ( minimum in june ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is caused by the m - b distribution , it is positive in the case of light targets regardless of the wimp mass .",
    "it is also positive for intermediate / heavy targets , if the wimps are relatively light .",
    "then the maximum occurs on june 3nd as expected .",
    "it becomes negative only for relatively heavy wimps .",
    "this distinction is , however , washed out , if one compares the case of the standard wimps on one hand with the combination of flows and the m - b distribution , in the form considered here , on the other ( compare the thick and the fine solid curves of panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figs [ fig : rh131 ] , [ fig : rh23 ] and [ fig : rh73 ] ) .     +   +   @xmath67gev     +   +   @xmath68gev     +   +   @xmath68gev",
    "in the present paper we first obtained results on the differential event rates , both modulated and time averaged , focusing our attention on the effects of debris flows .",
    "we found that :    * the flows indeed enhance the time averaged rates at relatively high energy transfers compared to the m - b distribution .",
    "all rates , however , fall as the energy transfer increases .",
    "this fall is only partial due to the velocity distribution .",
    "it is also caused by the nuclear form factor , especially in the case of heavy targets .",
    "* in view of the dependence of above rates on the unknown wimp mass , from the time averaged rates one does not have a clear signature to differentiate the debris flows from the standard distribution .",
    "* the differential modulated rates provide such a signature , the sign of the modulation amplitude , which determines the position of the maximum .",
    "the debris flows tend to favor a negative sign ( minimum on june 3nd ) , while the standard wimps favor a positive sign when the target is light or even when the target is heavy but the wimp is light ( maximum on june 3nd ) . for small reduced masses such rates due to the debris flows tend to increase with the recoil energy and eventually they dominate over the m - b distribution .",
    "we then proceeded and calculated the total event rates as functions of the wimp mass .",
    "we presented here results obtained with a zero threshold energy . for higher threshold energies we expect the debris flows to be suppressed a little less than the standard wimps @xcite , since the differential event rates associated with the former attain smaller values at low - energy transfers . the time averaged rates are affected by the debris flows , but one does not find a characteristic feature to differentiate the debris flows from the standard wimps",
    "the relative modulation amplitude @xmath64 , however , exhibits a very interesting feature , namely , if caused by the flows themselves , it is negative for all targets , even for the light ones , and in the entire wimp mass range ( minimum in june ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is caused by the m - b distribution , it is positive in the case of light targets regardless of the wimp mass .",
    "it is also positive for intermediate / heavy targets , if the wimps are relatively light .",
    "then , the maximum occurs on june 3nd as expected .",
    "it becomes negative only for relatively heavy wimps . this important distinction is , however , washed out , if one considers the combination of flows with the standard m - b distribution in the manner considered here .",
    "thus the measurement of the time dependence of the total event rate , with a relative difference between the maximum and the minimum of @xmath69 , may give a hint about the size of the wimp mass .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the measurement of the modulation , both in the differential and the total rates , for both light and heavy targets will shed light i ) on the mass of the wimps and ii ) on the existence of flows . to this end ,",
    "the differential event rate contains more information and may be a better discriminator .",
    "these issues may perhaps be settled even better , if data on directional experiments become available .",
