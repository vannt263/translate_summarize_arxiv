    "from the time of its first detection by penzias and wilson in 1965 @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation has provided us with a wealth of information about the universe .",
    "the information is encoded in the statistical properties of temperature and polarization anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the cmb temperature were first detected by cobe  @xcite .",
    "less than 10@xmath9 of cmb photons are linearly polarized due to the presence of quadrupole anisotropies in the plasma just before the matter - radiation decoupling phase @xcite .",
    "this polarization was first detected by dasi @xcite .",
    "polarization observations measure the stokes parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "they are however not invariant under rotations about the lines of sight .",
    "the complex quantities @xmath12 transform as spin @xmath13 objects , respectively .",
    "these are usually expressed in terms of gradient component and curl component known as @xmath4 mode and @xmath14 mode respectively .",
    "as @xmath4 mode and @xmath14 mode transform as scalars under these rotation transformations , these fields are widely used for the polarization analysis .",
    "the planck team has recently released high resolution map of @xmath4 mode @xcite .",
    "the additional information contained in the polarization data has significantly improved the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the main contribution of @xmath4 mode polarization comes from the primordial density fluctuations @xcite while the @xmath14 mode polarization can be generated by primordial gravitational waves @xcite or secondary effects such as gravitational lensing of cmb photons by large scale structure .",
    "@xmath14 mode polarization of primordial origin has not been detected yet , while the component that is sourced by lensing has been detected by sptpol @xcite .",
    "cmb fluctuations have been analyzed so far using various tools such as power spectrum , bispectrum , trispectrum , scalar minkowski functionals ( smfs ) and so on .",
    "smfs are used to study the geometric and topological properties of cosmological fields @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to study primordial non - gaussianity using cmb temperature @xcite and @xmath4 mode fields @xcite . to name a few other applications , smfs",
    "have also been used to study the effect of foreground contamination @xcite , cold spot anomaly @xcite and modified gravity theories through lensing @xcite in cmb .",
    "vector extensions of smfs have been introduced into cosmology and applied to study the morphology and dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "some of the other methods that have been used to study the topological properties are through clustering strength @xcite , number of hot and cold spots @xcite and extrema counts @xcite .",
    "the observed cmb data is consistent with the standard model of cosmology .",
    "however , there are a few anomalies seen in the cmb temperature anisotropy that contradict the expectations from the standard model .",
    "some of these anomalies are low variance , hemispherical asymmetry , point parity asymmetry , mirror parity asymmetry and cold spot @xcite .",
    "these have been detected by both wmap and planck experiments , implying that their origin is not due to the systematics in these experiments .",
    "the planck team s final data release which will include the analysis of large angular scale polarization will further reveal the statistical significance of these anomalies . in order to get a better understanding and resolution of these anomalies it is desirable to develop efficient methods which can analyze the data .",
    "tensor minkowski functionals ( tmfs ) are @xmath15 rank tensorial extensions of smfs @xcite that are constructed by taking tensor product of @xmath16 copies of the position vector and @xmath17 copies of the unit normal at each point of the boundary of a given structure ( see section 2 for detailed mathematical definition ) . by virtue of being tensor quantities and having more degrees of freedom ,",
    "they carry additional information in comparison to smfs about the morphology of a single structure or a set of many structures . in this paper",
    "we introduce tmfs as tools to analyze cosmological fields , in particular for analyzing the cmb fields which are defined on two dimensions . in this work we focus attention on one of the tmfs , denoted by @xmath0 , which is a generalization of the genus ( one of the three smfs in two dimensions ) , and which is a @xmath1 rank tensor . for a given set of many structures",
    "there are two ways of obtaining the eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "the first is to average the elements of @xmath0 over all the structures and then calculate the eigenvalues .",
    "the ratio of the two eigenvalues gives a measure of the degree of alignment or relative orientation of the structures .",
    "the second way is to calculate the eigenvalues for each structure , take their ratio , and then obtain the average ratio over all the structures .",
    "the average of the ratio of eigenvalues calculated in the second way gives a measure of the average intrinsic anisotropy of the structures .",
    "these new information about net orientation and net intrinsic anisotropy of a set of structures can be useful in resolving the anomalies in the cmb data , test the standard model of cosmology and search for deviations from it , and to discriminate different early universe physics models .",
    "they can also be used to study characteristic signatures of instrumental and foreground signals . moreover , tmfs are quite promising for analyzing data of the large scale structure of the universe and 21 cm emissions from the epoch of reionization and extracting cosmological information from them .",
    "g. e. schroder - turk _ et .",
    "_ @xcite have provided with an explicit formulae to calculate tmfs for structures on two dimensions .",
    "we implement the formulae and develop a code , that we refer to as tmfcode , to calculate tmfs , in particular @xmath0 , and from it the two kinds of ratio of eigenvalues described above .",
    "we carry out a detailed analysis of the numerical inaccuracies in these quantities due to pixelization of the plane . for application to the cmb fields we use the stereographic projection to project the cmb data which is given on the spherical sky , onto a euclidean plane to calculate the tmfs .",
    "we first calculate @xmath0 and the two eigenvalue ratios for simulated cmb fields in order to calculate the net orientation and net anisotropy of structures predicted by the standard @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "then we apply to temperature and @xmath4 mode polarization data from planck .",
    "we find no net orientation in the temperature data in agreement with the standard @xmath5cdm prediction of no net orientation within @xmath7 .",
    "however , we find @xmath8 evidence for a net orientation in @xmath4 mode . this deviation may be due to instrumental effects or other sources and requires further investigation for a proper understanding .",
    "we will pursue it further after the full planck data release .",
    "for the net intrinsic anisotropy of structures we obtain values for both temperature and @xmath4 mode that are consistent with the expectations from the standard model .",
    "tmfs have been used in various research areas to study a wide range of phenomena ranging from the shape of neuronal cells in the brain @xcite , to the shape of ice crystals in antarctica @xcite , to the shape of galaxies and clusters of galaxies in our universe @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we give the definition of tensor minkowski functionals , describe its numerical calculation and the corresponding numerical inaccuracies due to the pixelization of the data . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we apply the tmf @xmath18 to simulated cmb fields and we calculate the variation of net orientation @xmath19 and net anisotropy @xmath20 with the threshold value , and we also give an estimate of @xmath2 and @xmath3 that we expect for a gaussian , isotropic cmb field . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we apply the tmf @xmath18 to planck data , we compare the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with that of the simulated cmb fields and estimate the level of consistency of planck data with the standard model of cosmology . in appendix",
    "a , we describe how to quantify the level of orientation for a set of structures on the sphere .",
    "finally , we summarize the results along with a discussion of their implications and future directions in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "in this section we give the mathematical definition of tensor minkowski functionals and describe their numerical calculation for 2-dimensional random fields on euclidean space .",
    "let us denote a subset of 2-dimensional euclidean space with smooth closed boundary ( or boundaries ) by @xmath21 , and let the boundary contour ( or contours ) be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath21 may consist of one or more simply and/or multiply connected regions .",
    "a simply connected region will have no hole and a multiply connected region may have one or a countable number of holes in them . to connect with the terminology used in geometrical and topological analyses of cmb fields , which is our main interest here , we refer to @xmath21 as an _ excursion set_. a connected region is referred to as a _ hotspot _ and a hole as a _",
    "coldspot_. we will use the word _ structure _ to mean either a connected region or a hole . the contour that encloses a hotspot is assigned anticlockwise direction while a contour that encloses a hole is assigned clockwise direction .",
    "the morphological properties of @xmath21 can be characterized by three scalar minkowski functionals ( smfs ) which are defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and the functions @xmath25 are @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite . the symbol @xmath28 denotes the local curvature at each point on @xmath22 .",
    "physically @xmath29 are the area and the length of the boundary of connected region of @xmath21 and @xmath30 is the number of connected regions minus the number of holes in @xmath21 . note that these definitions have normalization constants that are different from the usual smfs used in the cmb analysis .",
    "however , their physical interpretation remains the same .",
    "being scalar quantities they are invariant under coordinate transformations and insensitive to the orientation and anisotropy of the structures ( connected regions and holes ) .",
    "tensor minkowski functionals are defined by generalizing the smfs  @xcite , as follows . for simplicity",
    "let us focus on a single simply or multiply connected region @xmath31 .",
    "the tensor minkowski functionals of rank @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , are constructed by taking @xmath16 number of copies of the position vector @xmath34 and @xmath17 number of copies of the normal vector @xmath35 at each point on the contour @xmath36 and taking their tensor product .",
    "the tensor minkowski functionals of @xmath37 with rank @xmath32 are then defined as @xmath38 for @xmath24 .",
    "the functions @xmath25 are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : smf ] ) .",
    "the tensor product between two vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tmf ] ) reduces to the three smfs . for @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "we get three vectorial minkowski functionals , and for @xmath45 we get seven tensor minkowski functionals of rank 2 .",
    "in general , the tensor minkowski functionals , unlike their scalar counterparts , are not invariant under coordinate transformations .",
    "they behave like tensors of corresponding rank .",
    "specifically , tensors @xmath46 and @xmath47 are invariant under translation operation while others vary . in this paper",
    "we focus only on translation invariant tensors as translation covariant tensors are sensitive to position or the choice of origin .",
    "specifically , we choose the tensor @xmath48 for the study as other translation invariant tensors are related to either @xmath0 or @xmath49 .    in practice real data",
    "is pixelized and hence in this case the excursion set @xmath21 will be a finite set consisting of pixels that are included in the structures .",
    "@xmath50 will be a finite set of pixels which form a single structure .",
    "therefore , the boundary of a single simply connected region will be a polygon , a doubly connected region ( having one hole ) will consist of two polygons , with the one corresponding to the hole being located inside the external one , and so on . the formulae for calculating tmfs of each polygon of @xmath37",
    "is given in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the tensor @xmath0 is given by @xmath51 where the pair @xmath52 labels the edge of the polygon between @xmath53 and @xmath54 vertices .",
    "@xmath55 is the edge of the polygon with length @xmath56 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the direction of @xmath55 is such that the boundary of a hotspot is anticlockwise while the boundary of a coldspot is clockwise .      for each structure ( hotspot or coldspot ) of @xmath21",
    ", @xmath0 being a @xmath57 matrix has two real eigenvalues , which we denote by @xmath58 and @xmath59 such that @xmath60 . for the entire @xmath21 let @xmath61 denote averaging over all structures ( hotspots or coldspots ) .",
    "then let @xmath62 and @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 , denote the eigenvalues of @xmath65 , where the averaging is done for each element of @xmath0 .",
    "then , we define the ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath66 as observed from the above formula , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both ratios of eigenvalues but they differ in the averaging process .",
    "@xmath2 is obtained by first averaging @xmath0 over all structures , calculating the eigenvalues of @xmath65 and then calculating their ratio . on the other hand @xmath3",
    "is obtained by first calculating the ratio of eigenvalues of @xmath0 for each structure and then averaging the ratio over all the structures .    if the excursion set consists of only one structure then @xmath67 . for a given structure @xmath3",
    "gives a measure of _ the intrinsic anisotropy _ or the deviation from rotational symmetry in the shape of the structure .",
    "for the case of many structures it gives the net anisotropy of all the structures .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that @xmath68 for isotropic shapes such an equilateral triangle , square and circle . for a general shape",
    "the value of @xmath3 lies between 0 and 1 , with @xmath69 implying that the shape of the structure is anisotropic with the value indicating the extent of anisotropy in the shape of the structure .",
    "the arrangement of many anisotropic structures can be associated with an _",
    "orientation_. @xmath2 gives a measure of the orientation or the deviation from rotational symmetry in the distribution of structures .",
    "if the structures are oriented randomly with no preferred direction then @xmath70 , else @xmath2 lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "if the structures with certain fixed anisotopic shape are arranged such that they are all orientated along the same direction then @xmath2 will be equal to @xmath3 .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath71 which is a measure of the degree of alignment of the structures as @xmath72 @xmath73 means that the structures are completely aligned , while @xmath74 means no net orientation .",
    "any value between zero and one will indicate the extent to which the structures are orientated .",
    "as this is a normalized form of net orientation @xmath2 , this will be a useful quantity for the purpose of comparison of the extent of orientation in the structures between different fields .",
    "we have developed a code that computes tmfs of individual structures of an excursion set on a plane and then estimates the ratio of eigenvalues @xmath2 , @xmath3 of these structures .",
    "we refer to this code as tmfcode . when an excursion set is input to the tmfcode it first estimates the line segments which forms the edges of the structures at each vertex ( point where four neighbouring pixels meet ) on the pixelized plane based on the configurations of the surrounding pixels ( see fig .",
    "7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the details of each structure such as @xmath55 corresponding to each of its edges are stored .",
    "then the code tracks all of the individual structures in the excursion set and assigns labels to each of these structures which allows us to retrieve the details of an individual structure whenever necessary .",
    "then @xmath0 can be calculated for each of these structures using eq .",
    "[ eq : for ] , and from it @xmath2 and @xmath3 are calculated .",
    "the approximation of a continuous contour by a polygon on a pixelized space will inherently lead to numerical inaccuracy in the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "we quantify this for an excursion set consisting of a single elliptic disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ellipse ] ) for which @xmath0 is given by the following analytic expression , @xmath75^{3/2 } } , \\end{array } \\label{eq.tensorformula}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes , respectively .",

    "<S> tensor minkowski functionals ( tmfs ) are tensorial generalizations of the usual minkowski functionals which are scalar quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce them here for use in cosmological analysis , in particular to analyze the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . </S>",
    "<S> they encapsulate information about the shapes of structures and the orientation of distributions of structures . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on one of the tmfs , namely @xmath0 , which is the @xmath1 rank tensor generalization of the genus . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the eigenvalues of the average of @xmath0 over all structures , @xmath2 , encodes the net orientation of the structures ; and the average of the ratios of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 for each structure , @xmath3 , encodes the net intrinsic anisotropy of the structures . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a code that computes @xmath0 , and from it @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for a set of structures on the 2-dimensional euclidean plane . </S>",
    "<S> we use it to compute @xmath2 and @xmath3 as functions of chosen threshold levels for simulated gaussian and isotropic cmb temperature and @xmath4 mode fields . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the value of @xmath2 to be one for both temperature and @xmath4 mode , which means that we recover the statistical isotropy of density fluctuations that we input in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the standard inflationary @xmath5cdm predicts that the level of intrinsic anisotropy of hotspot and coldspot structures in the cmb fields is quantified by @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> then we compute @xmath2 and @xmath3 for temperature and @xmath4 mode data from the planck mission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the temperature field agrees with the standard @xmath5cdm prediction of no net orientation within @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the structures in @xmath4 mode data have a net orientation that deviates from the theoretical expectation at @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . the possible origin of this deviation may be due to instrumental effects or other sources and needs to be investigated further . </S>",
    "<S> for the net intrinsic anisotropy of structures we obtain values of @xmath3 for both temperature and @xmath4 mode that are consistent with the expectations from the standard @xmath5cdm simulations . </S>",
    "<S> accurate measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be used to test the standard model of cosmology and to search for deviations from it . </S>"
