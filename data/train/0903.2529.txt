    "the charmonium system has been a rich gold mine , which continues to deepen our knowledge of strong interaction . especially starting from 2003",
    "many new charmonium or charmonium - like states were discovered experimentally , some of which do not easily fit into the conventional quark model picture .",
    "let s list these new states : @xmath7 , @xmath8/@xmath5/@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 etc .",
    "there have been many surprises and unexpected in this active field .",
    "the most recent one came from the cdf collaboration @xcite .    in the exclusive @xmath12 decays ,",
    "the cdf collaboration observed a narrow structure @xmath0 near the @xmath1 threshold ( @xmath13 gev ) with a statistical significance of @xmath14 .",
    "the mass and width of this signal are measured to be @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev @xcite . for comparison",
    ", @xmath0 is very similar to the charmonium - like state @xmath5 which was observed by both belle and babar collaborations near the @xmath17 threshold ( @xmath18 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the mass and width of y(3930 ) are @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev @xcite .",
    "clearly the c - parity and g - parity of @xmath0 are even . around this mass region , @xmath0 may naively be speculated to be an excited charmonium state .",
    "we list some possibilities below :    1 .",
    "the second radial excitation of the p - wave charmonium : @xmath21 + sometimes either @xmath7 or @xmath22 is speculated to be @xmath23 . then @xmath0 seems plausible as a candidate of @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   @xmath24 + as @xmath24 , its mass seems too high compared with @xmath25 at 4040 mev .",
    "other higher lying states such as @xmath26 etc .",
    "however as emphasized by cdf collaboration @xcite , @xmath0 lies well above the open charm decay threshold .",
    "charmoniums with this mass would decay into an open charm pair dominantly .",
    "the branching fraction of its hidden charm decay mode @xmath27 is expected to be tiny .",
    "thus , both the narrow width of @xmath0 and its large hidden charm decay pattern disfavor the conventional charmonium interpretation .    one may be tempted to try the non - conventional assignment of @xmath0 as a tetraquark state .",
    "in fact , the @xmath28 @xmath29 tetraquark states were predicted to be around 4.1 gev in the simple chromo - magnetic interaction quark model while their @xmath30 partner seems unbound @xcite .",
    "however tetraquarks will fall apart into a pair of charmed mesons very easily . as a tetraquark",
    ", the width of @xmath0 would be around several hundred mev instead of 12 mev as observed by cdf .",
    "the @xmath31 meson decay process does not provide a glue - rich environment as in the upsilon / charmonium annihilation .",
    "so the possibility of @xmath0 being a glueball is small .",
    "recall that @xmath10 is proposed as the @xmath32 hybrid charmonium state @xcite .",
    "all current experimental information is compatible with this assumption @xcite .",
    "the only slightly worrisome issue is the leptonic width @xmath33\\approx 0.8 $ ] kev if one assumes @xmath34 \\approx 1\\%$ ] .",
    "such a leptonic width naively seems a little large for a vector hybrid .",
    "fortunately no dynamical selection rule has been discovered to suppress the leptonic width of a hybrid state up to now .    within this context , @xmath0 could be an exotic charmonium with @xmath35 , which is a partner of @xmath10 within the same @xmath36 hybrid charmonium family .",
    "one may challenge this assignment with the following three facts : ( 1 ) the narrow width of @xmath0 which is much smaller than that of @xmath10 ; ( 2 ) the different decay patterns of @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath10 is observed in @xmath37 , @xmath38 modes while @xmath0 only in @xmath27 ; ( 3 ) the similarity between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "one does not expect two exotic @xmath39 states lying so closely .",
    "in fact , the extreme similarity between @xmath0 and @xmath5 suggests that they be partner molecular states belonging to the same representation as predicted in our previous work @xcite , where we have performed a systematic study of the possible molecular states composed of a pair of heavy mesons in the framework of the meson exchange model .",
    "@xmath0 is a @xmath40 molecular state while @xmath5 is its @xmath41 molecular partner .",
    "their hidden charm decays occur through the rescattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "we present more details in sections [ sec2]-[sec3 ] .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath5 were observed in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 modes , these two states are isoscalars .",
    "the isoscalar heavy molecular states in the vector - vector channel are denoted as @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively in our previous work @xcite . from now on we identify @xmath44 as @xmath5 and @xmath45 as @xmath0 .",
    "their flavor wave functions are latexmath:[\\ ] ] with @xmath64=\\frac{1}{4\\pi r}\\left(e^{-mr}-e^{-\\lambda r}\\right)-\\frac{\\xi^2}{8\\pi \\lambda}e^{-\\lambda r}$ ] , @xmath65=-\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left(r^2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right)y[\\lambda , m , r]$ ] , @xmath66=\\left[-\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right)+m^2\\right]z[\\lambda , m , r]$ ] , where @xmath67 .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ vv - potential-4 ] , where both the @xmath76 and @xmath79 meson exchange is allowed .",
    "clearly there exists quite strong attraction around 1 fm for both @xmath5 and @xmath0 with @xmath80 .",
    "then we solved the schrdinger equation to find the binding energy for the @xmath5 and @xmath81 systems .",
    "some typical numerical results are collected in table [ dsds ] and fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "we found molecular solutions for @xmath5 and @xmath81 with @xmath74 .",
    "the first line in table [ dsds ] is added after cdf released their data , which corresponds to the central mass of y(3930 ) and y(4143 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]    2 .",
    "open charm two - body decay + at the first sight , one may worry whether the open - charm decays of @xmath5 and @xmath0 overwhelm the hidden decay as in the excited charmonium decays . however , this is not the case for molecular states .",
    "in fact , the kinematically allowed modes are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "these decays can only happen via the exchange of a light meson as shown in fig .",
    "[ re3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) . in other words ,",
    "the open - charm decay widths are comparable to the hidden - charm width .",
    "there are some simple selection rules from the parity and angular momentum conservation .",
    "for example , the @xmath80 state does not decay into @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath30 state decays into @xmath85 or @xmath86 through d - wave .",
    "such a d - wave decay width should be much smaller than that for the above hidden charm s - wave decay mode .",
    "open charm three - body and four - body decays + another potentially important decay mode is that one or two components of the molecular state decays into a @xmath87 or @xmath88 pair .",
    "the possible three- and four - body decay modes of @xmath5 are @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "for @xmath0 , the possible modes are @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "however all these three- and four - body decay modes are kinematically forbidden !",
    "the isospin violating modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 are also kinematically forbidden for @xmath0 .",
    "4 .   radiative decay + one or both vector mesons can easily decay into the @xmath95 or @xmath96 final states .",
    "the typical radiative modes of @xmath5 are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 . for @xmath0",
    "the radiative modes are @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "the radiative decay width and the line shape of the photon spectrum are very interesting , which will be pursued in a subsequent work .",
    "semi - leptonic and non - leptonic decay + the semi - leptonic and non - leptonic decays via one component of the molecular state also contain useful information of its inner structure .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the various assignment of the @xmath0 signal discovered by the cdf collaboration . with the extreme similarity between @xmath5 and @xmath0 in mind ,",
    "we conclude that both of them are very good molecular states composed of a pair of vector charm mesons , which was predicted in the meson exchange model @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath0 are molecular partners with @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "such a classification neatly explains the narrow width of @xmath0 .",
    "the hidden charm discovery mode @xmath42 naturally becomes one of the dominant decay modes since the kinematically allowed open - charm decays also occur through the same rescattering mechanism .",
    "hence the width of the hidden - charm and open charm decay widths are comparable . especially for the case of @xmath103",
    "the hidden charm decay is the dominant decay mode since the two - body open charm decay occurs through d - wave .    in short summary ,",
    "cdf , babar and belle collaborations may have discovered heavy molecular states already .",
    "we urge our experimental colleagues to confirm y(4143 ) and measure its @xmath104 after accumulating more @xmath105 data , or even in the radiative decays .",
    "in fact the above interpretation helps us to clarify these new charmonium states observed in the past six years :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 is a @xmath4 charmonium @xmath106 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath8 may be @xmath24 ; 3 .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath5 are probably molecular states ; 4 .",
    "@xmath10 is a good candidate of the hybrid charmonium ; 5 .",
    "@xmath7 may be @xmath107 or a @xmath108 molecular state ; 6 .",
    "@xmath109 could be a molecular candidate however its existence needs further confirmation .",
