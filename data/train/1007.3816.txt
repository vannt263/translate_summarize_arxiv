    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe ; they formed from high amplitude peaks of the primordial density field .",
    "clusters therefore occupy the high mass exponential tail of the dark matter halo mass function , which is sensitive to the matter density and expansion history of the universe , and to modifications of the laws of gravity .",
    "measurements of the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass function across a broad range of redshifts can thus provide a powerful tool for constraining the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "numerous galaxy cluster surveys will soon begin delivering a huge amount of data at optical , x - ray , and millimeter wavelengths , e.g.  from subaru / hyper - suprime - cam , _ erosita _ , _ spt _ and _ act_. one of the main goals of these surveys is to measure the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass function , and thus to probe the expansion history of the universe .",
    "however , the mass of a galaxy cluster is not directly measurable .",
    "these surveys will therefore rely on `` mass - like '' observables ( e.g.,x - ray temperature  evrard et al .",
    "1996 ) and scaling relations between these observables and mass , to construct the all - important mass functions .",
    "calibration of mass - observable scaling relations is therefore currently a high priority observational goal .",
    "traditionally , observational studies of the mass - observable scaling relations have relied solely on x - ray observations , typically concentrating on the mass - temperature relation ( e.g. ,  finoguenov et al . , 2001 ; sanderson et al . , 2003 ; ettori et al . , 2004",
    "; arnaud et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "x - ray - based mass measurements require hydrostatic equilibrium ( h.e . ) and spherical symmetry to be assumed , and either measurement of the temperature profile , or an assumption of isothermality .",
    "inclusion of x - ray temperature information in both axes of the mass - temperature relation may therefore induce intrinsic correlations into the measured relation .",
    "the validity of the underlying assumptions also warrants careful testing .",
    "gravitational lensing offers cluster mass measurements that are independent of x - ray observations , and do not rely on assuming h.e .. joint lensing / x - ray studies ( e.g. , okabe & umetsu 2008 ; kawaharada et al .",
    "2010 ) are therefore a promising route for calibrating cluster mass - observable scaling relations",
    ". indeed , early lensing / x - ray studies of cluster cores indicated that the scatter in cluster temperature may be as large as @xmath17 at fixed mass , and that the scatter is dominated by disturbed , merging clusters , in which h.e",
    ".  may not hold ( smith et al .",
    "subsequent work has concentrated on using weak - lensing data to extend this pioneering work beyond cluster cores to overdensities of @xmath18 with respect to the critical density ( bardeau et al .  2007 ; hoekstra 2007 ; pedersen & dahle 2007 ; zhang et al .  2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "the main limiting factors in these weak - lensing / x - ray studies have been the limited statistical precision and heterogeneity of the available weak - lensing data , and also the small samples observed to date .    on the theoretical side , kravtsov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed the so - called quasi - integrated pressure , @xmath19 as a `` new robust low - scatter x - ray mass indicator '' , or , a mass - like observable .",
    "this was motivated by analysis of their hydrodynamic numerical simulations of clusters using an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code .",
    "they found that the temperature deviations from the @xmath11 relation are anti - correlated with the gas mass deviations from the @xmath16 relation .",
    "this anti - correlation found in their simulations acts to suppress the scatter in the @xmath12 relation , independent of the dynamical state of the clusters .",
    "this prediction has stimulated much observational effort within the x - ray community that has broadly supported the idea that @xmath4 is the optimal x - ray mass proxy ( e.g. ,  maughan 2007 ; arnaud et al .",
    ", 2007 ; vikhlinin et al .",

    "( 2010 ) have also recently suggested that previous x - ray - only studies may have underestimated the scatter in mass - observable scaling relations by a factor of @xmath10 . in summary , a joint lensing / x - ray observational investigation of the relationships between mass and gas mass , temperature , and @xmath4 , is urgently needed .",
    "such joint studies also lend themselves well to the task of observationally testing various corrections that have been derived from numerical simulations to account for deviations from h.e .. for example , numerous authors have pointed out that h.e .",
    "mass estimates may underestimate the cluster mass because of non - thermal pressure support due to turbulence caused by bulk motion of the cluster gas ( e.g. , evrard 1990 ; rasia et al.2006 ; nagai et al .  2007 ; piffaretti & valdarnini 2008 ; fang et al.2009 ) , and vikhlinin et al .",

    "as alluded to above , zhang et al.s results were limited by the quality of the weak - lensing mass measurements , because the underlying data were heterogeneous in observing facilities , fields of view , and filters used . in this article we address these issues by using our own weak - lensing mass measurements based on uniform analysis of our subaru / suprime - cam observations ( okabe & umetsu 2008 ; okabe et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our subaru/_xmm - newton _ sample remains small , at just 12 clusters . as we discuss throughout this article , sample size",

    "for the purpose of this paper , we compiled a sample of 12 clusters  a68 , a115 , a209 , a267 , a383 , a1835 , a1914 , z7160 , a2261 , rxj2129.6@xmath250005 , a2390 , and a2631  that represents the overlap between the samples for which subaru / suprime - cam and _ xmm - newton _ data are available , and that we have previously published ( zhang et al .  2008 ;",
    "okabe & umetsu 2008 ; okabe et al.2010 ) .",
    "the sample does not suffer , by design , any strong biases to extreme merging or extreme cool core clusters , and therefore can be regarded , qualitatively , as representative of massive , x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "however , given the small sample size , we refrain from attempting to quantify how these 12 might be biased with respect to the underlying cluster population in this article . instead , this article presents some early results from our subaru/_xmm - newton _ program , that benefit from the use of our subaru data , as opposed to the cfh12k / uh8k / not data that we used in zhang et al .",
    "we defer detailed discussion of sample definition and possible biases to future articles in this series that will address larger , more complete samples .",

    "( 2010 ) ; here we provide a brief outline of some important aspects of our methods .",
    "we selected background galaxies based on their location in the color - magnitude plane ",
    "typically @xmath26  bluer or redder than cluster red - sequence by a minimum color - offset ( umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ; umetsu et al .",
    "2009 ; okabe et al .",
    "2010 ) . as demonstrated by okabe et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , contamination of the background galaxy catalogs by faint ( unlensed ) cluster members dilutes the weak - lensing signal .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at smaller clustercentric radii because the number density of cluster galaxies rises towards the cluster centers . in the absence of our color - selection techniques , weak - lensing @xmath27 and @xmath28 measurements can be biased low by @xmath29%@xmath30% .",
    "we used the cosmos photometric redshift catalog ( ilbert et al .",
    "2009 ) to estimate the redshift of the background galaxies .",
    "specifically , we calculated the average lensing weight , @xmath31 ( see also equation ( 10 ) in okabe et al .",
    "2010 ) , of each background galaxy catalog by selecting galaxies identical to both our catalogs , and the cosmos catalog . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the angular diameter distances between the observer and source ( background galaxy ) and lens and source respectively .    in cosmology",
    "the three - dimensional spherical mass , @xmath34 , enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath35 for a given overdensity @xmath36 is most relevant for the cluster mass function , where @xmath35 is chosen such that the average density within the sphere is equal to the critical mass density at the cluster redshift , @xmath37 , times the overdensity @xmath36 .",
    "we estimated @xmath34 for each cluster by fitting the measured radial profile of lensing distortion signals to the nfw model prediction parameterized by the mass @xmath34 and @xmath38 , where the nfw mass profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 ) is given as @xmath39 with @xmath38 being the concentration parameter .    describing cluster - scale dark matter halos as spherical objects",
    "may cause systematic errors in individual mass measurements because clusters are predicted to be triaxial in the collisionless cdm model ( jing & suto 2002 ) . for example , if the major axis of a triaxial halo is aligned with or perpendicular to the line of sight , a spherical model would overestimate or underestimate the mass , respectively , and also cause systematic errors in the measurement of the concentration parameter ( oguri et al .  2005",
    "; gavazzi  2005 ; corless et al .",
    "however , if the distribution of cluster orientations is random , then adopting spherical mass models should not introduce a significant bias into the properties of the sample .",
    "we therefore check that this is the case for our sample by comparing the spherical mass measurements from okabe et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that we use here with triaxial mass measurements of the same clusters using the same background galaxy catalogs from oguri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . on average",
    "the spherical ( @xmath40 ) and triaxial ( @xmath41 ) masses agree well  @xmath42 , for @xmath43  confirming the expectation of negligible bias .      the observations and data reduction are described in detail by zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) . in brief , the three mass proxies considered in this article are calculated as follows .",
    "the global temperature is a volume average of the spectrally measured , radial temperature profile limited to the radial range of @xmath44 .",
    "the gas mass @xmath45 was obtained for each cluster by integrating a double-@xmath46 model of the electron density that was fitted to the x - ray surface brightness profile .",
    "the quasi - integrated pressure is the product of the gas mass and the global temperature : @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 have been calculated using radii obtained from the weak - lensing analysis , and not using radii calculated from the x - ray analysis as in zhang et al .",
    "this definition of radii introduces a subtle correlation with weak lensing mass  we will explore this when estimating the intrinsic scatter in the mass - observable scaling relations in sec .",
    "[ subsec : cov_int ] and the appendix .",
    "finally , we adopted a self - consistent definition of the cluster centers based on the weak lensing analysis .",
    "this caused us to change the centers of just two clusters  a1914 and a2631  from those used by zhang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "previous joint lensing / x - ray studies have identified the dynamical state of clusters as a significant source of scatter in mass - observable scaling relations ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ; pedersen & dahle 2007 ; zhang et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) . in this section",
    "we therefore classify the clusters as either `` disturbed '' or `` undisturbed '' , based on a new method patterned on those developed for the morphological classification of galaxies ( e.g. ,  conselice 2003 ) .",
    "we calculate the asymmetry ( @xmath51 ) and fluctuation ( @xmath52 ) of the x - ray surface brightness distribution in the @xmath53  kev band .",
    "asymmetry is defined as @xmath54 , the normalized sum of the absolute value of the flux residuals where @xmath55 is a matrix element of the combined mos1+mos2 _ xmm - newton _ frame in the 0.7 - 2.0  kev band , flat fielded , point source subtracted and refilled assuming a poisson distribution , and @xmath56 are the matrix elements obtained by rotating the above frame by @xmath57 .",
    "the pixel size of both frames is @xmath58 .",
    "the fluctuation , @xmath52 , measures deviations from a smooth flux distribution and is defined as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an element in a frame smoothed on 2arcmin scales , which corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath61  kpc at @xmath62 .",
    "such smoothing also suppresses the effect of the complex shape of the _ xmm - newton _ point spread function ( ghizzardi 2001 ) .",
    "we estimate the statistical errors of @xmath51 and @xmath52 assuming poisson noise computed within a radius of @xmath63 , excluding ccd gaps and bad pixels .",
    "we also estimate the systematic error of @xmath51 caused by uncertainties in the cluster centers by recalculating @xmath51 , each time moving the cluster centers onto one of the neighboring pixels within the @xmath64 circle from the nominal cluster center .",
    "the clusters span the range @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ f : a+f ] ) .",
    "dynamically disturbed clusters generally have an asymmetric x - ray morphology , with an offset between optical and x - ray centers , and are therefore expected to have larger @xmath51 and @xmath52 than undisturbed clusters . to separate the clusters into two subsamples that represent relatively disturbed and relatively undisturbed systems , we subdivided the @xmath67 plane into four quadrants : ( 1 ) @xmath68 and @xmath69  rxj2129 , a209 , a383 , a1835 , and a2390 , ( 2 ) @xmath70 and @xmath69  a2261 and a1914 , ( 3 ) @xmath68 and @xmath71  a68 , a2631 , a267 , and z7160 , and ( 4 ) @xmath70 and @xmath71  a115 .",
    "we classify the five clusters in quadrant ( 1 )  low @xmath51 and low @xmath52  as undisturbed clusters , and the remaining seven as disturbed clusters .",
    "it is immediately obvious that this classification matches other possible classification schemes well .",
    "for example , four of the five undisturbed clusters host a cool core ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "2003 ; allen et al .  2001 ; peterson et al.2002 ) , and the disturbed clusters have been discussed extensively as merging / cold - front clusters ( e.g. , okabe & umetsu 2008 ; mazzotta & giacintucci 2008 ; gutierrez & krawczynski 2005 ) , in which complicated temperature / entropy distributions or large offsets between lensing / optical and x - ray centroids exits ( e.g. , finoguenov et al .  2005 ; smith et al .  2005",
    "; sanderson et al .",
    "2009a ) . in summary ,",
    "all of the clusters identified as disturbed in the @xmath67 plane are independently confirmed as disturbed by other methods in the literature .",
    "however we stress again the relative nature of the disturbed / undisturbed classification , and acknowledge that the disturbed clusters in particular likely comprise clusters in a wide variety of stages in their dynamical evolution .",
    "we will return to this issue later when we assess the impact of a single extreme merging cluster on our attempts to calibrate the mass - observable scaling relations .",
    "in this section , we present the main empirical results of the slope , normalization , and intrinsic scatter in the mass - observable scaling relations and how these depend on the dynamical state of the clusters .",
    "we also discuss the correlation between gas mass and temperature deviations .",
    "if gravitational heating is the dominant mechanism responsible for the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters , the following scaling relations are expected to hold : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and @xmath2 are the total mass , gas mass , and temperature of a cluster , respectively , and @xmath74 is the quasi - integrated pressure .",
    "these relations , specifically the exponents of @xmath73 , and @xmath2 , are usually referred to as self - similar , following kaiser ( 1986 ) .",
    "note that the term @xmath75^{1/2}$ ] accounts for the redshift evolution of the clusters in a flat universe .    in the following subsections we therefore fit the functional form @xmath76 to the data , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the normalization , @xmath79 is the x - ray observable ( i.e. ,  @xmath4 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 ) multiplied by @xmath80 or not as appropriate based on equations 1 - 3 , and @xmath81 is the logarithmic slope .",
    "these fits are done at three overdensities with respect to the critical density : @xmath82 and @xmath7 .",
    "the scaling relation slope and normalization measurements are based on orthogonal regression performed using the orthogonal distance regression package ( odrpack , e.g.  boggs et al .",
    "1987 ) taking into account the measurement errors .",
    "in general we ignore the subtle correlations introduced by measuring the x - ray observables within radii defined by the weak - lensing analysis , although we do take them into account in sec.[subsec : scatter ] when we measure the intrinsic scatter .",
    "to check for consistency with other work , we have also refitted the relations using the bisector modification of the bces method ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) . the difference on best - fit scaling relation parameters between the two fitting methods is a small fraction of statistical uncertainties .",
    "for example , the difference on best - fit slopes and normalizations between the two methods is typically @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the statistical error respectively .",
    "we also did the bootstrap resampling to estimate the sample variance on the slope parameter , and found that it is @xmath85 of the statistical errors .",
    "we first fit the scaling relations to the full sample of 12 clusters with both slope @xmath81 and normalization @xmath78 as free parameters . at @xmath86",
    "the best - fit slopes of all three relations agree well with the self - similar model ( table  [ tab : slope ] ) . at higher overdensities",
    ", the agreement deteriorates for all three relations , indeed the slopes of the @xmath87 , @xmath88 relations are discrepant from self - similar at @xmath89 at @xmath5 .",
    "this flattening in the scaling relations at higher @xmath36 can also be seen graphically in figures  [ f : my1 ] , [ f : mt1 ] and [ f : mmg1 ] , in which we show the @xmath34@xmath4 , @xmath34@xmath90 and @xmath91@xmath3 relations respectively .",
    "to constrain the normalization parameter @xmath78 , we fix the slope parameters to the self - similar values and repeat the fits .",
    "the measured normalizations are all consistent with those obtained by zhang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using the same _ xmm - newton _ data and independent weak - lensing data .",
    "the superior quality and uniformity of our subaru data shows differences between the normalizations for disturbed and undisturbed clusters .",

    "see the appendix .",
    "we also confirmed that the best - fit slopes and normalizations obtained using the odr methods discussed above are consistent within errors with those obtained using the more sophisticated bayesian method considered here .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in all three relations is well described by a lognormal distribution .",
    "the @xmath11 relation exhibits the largest intrinsic scatter ( @xmath99 ; table  [ tab : int_scat ] ) among the three mass - observable relations .",
    "we also observe an increase in the intrinsic scatter with increasing radius ( i.e.  decreasing the interior overdensity @xmath36 ) .",
    "the same trend is found in undisturbed clusters , while the opposite trend is found in disturbed clusters . however , this trend is not a physical feature of the intracluster gas affected by gravitational heating , because we used a fixed global temperature measurement in the radial range of @xmath100 for all the overdensities .",
    "the @xmath16 relation is the tightest of the three , with an intrinsic scatter in mass of @xmath101 at @xmath86 and @xmath6 . at @xmath5",
    "the scatter is roughly double that at lower overdensity ( table  [ tab : int_scat ] ) , which may be due to different core properties of individual clusters .",

    "we measure the intrinsic scatter for the @xmath16 and @xmath11 relations ( @xmath132 and @xmath124 ) with their slopes set to the self - similar prediction .",
    "the likelihood ( eq .  [ eq : likelihood ] ) is given in the appendix .",
    "we explore parameter space using the metropolis hastings algorithm , as described in the appendix , restricting ranges of values explored to @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we first impose a flat prior on @xmath136 , and @xmath124 within the limits referred to above , and obtain measurements of intrinsic scatter that are in good agreement with those obtained by fitting the @xmath16 and @xmath11 relations independently : @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( table  [ tab : sint ] ) .",
    "however , the coefficient , @xmath124 , is not well determined due to the tail of the posterior probability distribution extending to negative values .",
    "nevertheless , we derive a @xmath139 confidence lower limit of @xmath140 .",
    "we also measure the mode of the marginalized posterior probability distribution to be @xmath141 .",
    "we then repeat the fit , this time using gaussian priors centered on the best - fit measurements of @xmath142 and @xmath143 . as shown in the second column in table [ tab : sint ] , all resulting parameters are consistent with those in the flat prior .",
    "this time the mode of the posterior probability distribution is @xmath144 . , and we find that the lower limit on @xmath124 is again positive ",
    "i.e.  it is positive independent of the prior .",
    "the positive coefficient leads to a large intrinsic scatter of @xmath145 because the last term in @xmath146 becomes positive .",
    "the positive coefficient indicates that deviations in gas mass and temperature are partially correlated .",
    "however , we stress that the small size of our observed sample severely limits the statistical power of our results  specifically , we can not rule out the possibility that the gas mass and temperature deviations are two random variables that are correlated by accident . to quantify this , we calculated the probability , @xmath147 , is higher than the observed value ( pugh & winslow 1966 ) .",
    "since the probability is non - negligible ( @xmath148 ; table [ tab : sint ] ) , we can not yet completely exclude this possibility .",
    "therefore , we need to increase the sample size before we can make definitive statements on the correlation of intrinsic scatter .",
    "first we compare our results with those of our pilot study ( zhang et al .",
    "the main difference between zhang et al.s analysis and that presented here is that zhang et al.s weak - lensing mass measurements were drawn from the literature , and thus suffered heterogeneous image quality , observed depth , and systematic uncertainties relating to background galaxy selection and faint galaxy shape measurement . despite these differences ,",
    "the overall normalization of our mass - observable scaling relations agree within the uncertainties with those of zhang et al .",
    "however despite our sample being roughly a factor of two smaller than that of zhang et al . , we detect structural segregation in the @xmath12 and @xmath11 relations at @xmath15 significance . our ability to make",
    "this detection is likely due to the factor of @xmath105 smaller statistical errors on weak - lensing mass measurements of individual clusters , thanks to the superb quality of our subaru data .",
    "this is the first time that structural segregation has been found in the @xmath12 relation , however it has been detected in the @xmath11 relation at a similar amplitude , and level of significance in previous joint lensing / x - ray studies ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ; pedersen & dahle 2007 ) .",
    "theoretical studies ( e.g.  randall et al .  2002 ) suggest that this segregation may be caused by cluster - cluster mergers boosting the temperature of disturbed merging clusters .",
    "however orientation effects may also contribute to systematic errors in weak - lensing mass measurements that exaggerate the segregation ( meneghetti et al.2010 ) .",
    "we therefore defer physical interpretation of the observed segregation to a future careful investigation of the degeneracy between cluster orientation and residuals on mass - observable scaling relations .",
    "we also compare the normalizations of our @xmath12 and @xmath11 relations at @xmath86 with the same from vikhlinin et al.s ( 2009a ) x - ray - only study of `` relaxed '' clusters with _",
    "chandra_. note that , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : m - o ] , our results are insensitive to whether we use orthogonal regression or bisector fitting techniques ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "used the bisector method .",
    "the normalizations of our @xmath12 and @xmath11 relations for undisturbed clusters agree within the uncertainties with vikhlinin et al.s ( 2009a ) relaxed clusters ( figs .",
    "[ f : my1 ]  &  [ f : mt1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that orientation effects may not be a major influence on the normalization of our undisturbed cluster scaling relations . on the other hand , it is thus clear that the normalizations of our disturbed cluster scaling relations differ from vikhlinin et al.s results at @xmath15 significance .",
    "it will therefore be important in the future to study the mass - observable scaling relations with large samples comprising clusters that span a wide range of dynamical states .",
    "this need will become more acute at high redshift because the fraction of disturbed clusters likely increases toward higher redshifts .",
    "the normalizations of our @xmath16 and @xmath12 relations are lower in mass at fixed x - ray observable ( fig .",
    "[ f : my1 ]  &  [ f : mt1 ] ) than the predictions from nagai et al.s ( 2007 ) simulations .",
    "this result is consistent with our pilot study ( zhang et al .",
    "2008 ) , in which we compared our joint lensing / x - ray observational results with a wider range of simulations including those of borgani et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and showed that the normalizations disagree with the simulations at @xmath149 for @xmath12 and @xmath150 for @xmath11 and @xmath16 relations , respectively .",
    "the structural segregation found in our @xmath11 and @xmath12 relations ",
    "i.e.  undisturbed clusters are @xmath13 and @xmath14 more massive than disturbed clusters at fixed temperature and fixed @xmath4 respectively at @xmath15 significance  disagrees with kravtsov et al.s ( 2006 ) simulations , upon which they based their proposal of @xmath4 as a low - scatter mass proxy . in summary , they found no difference in the normalization of @xmath12 between clusters that they classified as `` relaxed '' and `` unrelaxed '' ( roughly equivalent to our undisturbed / disturbed classification ) , and that their relaxed clusters are less massive at fixed temperature than unrelaxed clusters ",
    "i.e.opposite to our observational result .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath11 and @xmath16 relations at @xmath86 ( @xmath151 and @xmath103 respectively ) is comparable to kravtsov et al .",
    "however the anti - correlation between temperature and gas mass deviations from the mean @xmath11 and @xmath16 relations predicted by kravtsov et al .",
    ", and that has motivated much attention on @xmath4 as a low scatter mass proxy , is not supported by our data , although we need to investigate this for a larger sample .",
    "in contrast with kravtsov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find that the lower limit of the positive coefficient for intrinsic scatter is in better agreement with stanek et al.s sph millennium gas simulations showing that the coefficients between the spectroscopic - like temperature and gas fraction for @xmath152 and @xmath153 are positive irrespective of the process of preheating and cooling .",
    "correlated gas mass and temperature deviations imply a possibility that adiabatic compression / expansion of the intracluster gas is important in cluster evolution .",
    "these adiabatic fluctuations propagate much faster than cooling losses , and thus help to explain why stanek et al.s simple hydrodynamical simulation matches the observations well .",
    "umetsu et al .  (",
    "2010 ) have also suggested that , in the adiabatic expansion phase of a post - merger , both temperature and ( encompassed ) gas mass decrease compared to those before the merger . another possibility can be due to the departure from the spherical symmetry .",
    "as long as the intracluster gas is in h.e .",
    ", even in the elongated gravitational potential well , the gas mass distribution is supposed to be more round than the distribution of dark matter . in our modeling , we assume spherical symmetry of the gas and mass profiles , in which deviations from spherical geometry are transferred into systematic measurement and may in part lead to a positive correlation between the gas mass and mass .",
    "furthermore , many possible deviations in mass - observable relations could be relevant to the interpretation of these results .",
    "for example , star - formation efficiency affects the total gas mass and the epoch for cluster formation affects the cluster temperature . some of these effects imply other correlations that can be explored in the future with a larger sample , e.g.  correlations between temperature deviations and dark matter profile shapes , or between deviations in the gas mass and total stellar fraction .",
    "finally , we propose a method , based on principal component analysis , for constructing and calibrate a low - scatter mass proxy using solely observational data .",
    "thanks to multi - dimensional fitting , since we obtained both the intrinsic covariance and the normalization , we here do not need to take into account for measurement errors . by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the identity matrix , we can obtain its eigenvalues @xmath156 and eigenvectors @xmath157 , as follows : @xmath158 , \\\\",
    "y_{\\pm } & = & { m_{\\rm gas}}t^{p_\\pm } , \\\\",

    "note that if the coefficient @xmath124 is negative , as predicted by kravtsov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , then the temperature exponent , @xmath161 , is always positive . in this framework , the scaling relation can be written as : @xmath162 and the intrinsic scatter on mass when one estimate from x - ray observables via new scaling relation is given by : @xmath163 basically , a combination of highly correlated / anti - correlated observables gives a new mass proxy with smaller scatter .",
    "unfortunately , our sample is too small to constrain the covariance of the intrinsic scatter well , and to perform this principal component analysis .",
    "this exercise awaits enlargement of our sample . in principle",
    ", a combination of the principal component analysis and the method for measuring the covariance of intrinsic scatter ( see the appendix ) could be applied to multi - dimensional ( i.e.  weak lensing , x - ray , sz and optical observables ) data sets both within locuss and in large forthcoming surveys .",
    "we have presented a joint weak - lensing and x - ray analysis of 12 clusters , based on subaru and _ xmm - newton _ observations as part of the locuss survery .",
    "the main goal is to calibrate the scaling relations between cluster mass obtained from weak lensing observations ( @xmath1 ) , and x - ray observables , specifically the gas temperature , gas mass , and quasi - integrated pressure ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath164 ) .",
    "an accurate understanding of these relations will be essential to the success of future attempts to constrain dark energy with clusters via growth of structure experiments .",
    "our main results are summarized below .    *",
    "the dynamical state of clusters can be diagnosed empirically via morphological classification of clusters based on asymmetry ( @xmath51 ) and fluctuation ( @xmath52 ) parameters derived from imaging data from _ xmm - newton_. undisturbed clusters are identified as those with relatively symmetric and smooth x - ray morphology  @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; disturbed clusters satisfy either or both of these criteria .",
    "five clusters are classified as undisturbed and seven as disturbed .",
    "this classification matches those based on alternative measures such as the presence / absence of cool cores , cold fronts , and substructures in lensing mass maps .",
    "* we detected structural segregation in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 relations at @xmath86 , in the sense that undisturbed clusters are @xmath13 and @xmath14 more massive than disturbed clusters at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath4 respectively , at @xmath15 significance .",
    "segregation in the @xmath11 plane is qualitatively in agreement with some of the previous observational results ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ; pedersen & dahle 2007 ) ; as far as we know these are the first joint lensing / x - ray results on the @xmath12 relation .",
    "these results both contradict kravtsov et al.s predictions upon which they based their proposal that @xmath4 may be a useful low - scatter mass proxy . * the intrinsic scatter in the observed @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 relations",
    "is measured to be @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 respectively at @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath3 therefore appears to be the most promising mass proxy of these three observables , especially because the scatter in @xmath16 appears to be independent of the cluster dynamical state . *",
    "the best - fit mass - observable scaling relations are sensitive to the inclusion / exclusion of one cluster in our sample , namely a1914 , a well known merging cluster .",
    "if this cluster is excluded from our analysis then the scatter is greatly reduced  most notably , the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath12 relation is reduced by @xmath107 .",
    "we conclude that a larger , more complete sample of clusters is required to reliably calibrate the scaling relations and to robustly measure how the most extreme merging clusters influence the relations . this will be particularly valuable as scaling relation studies proceed to higher redshifts at which merging clusters are expected to become more prevalent . *",
    "temperature deviations from the best - fit @xmath11 relation and gas mass deviations from the @xmath16 relation are positively correlated .",
    "the coefficient between the gas mass and temperature deviations is positive , independent of our analysis methods , and is found to be @xmath168 .",
    "this result , in particular the lower limit on @xmath124 agrees well with predictions based on millennium gas simulations ( stanek et al .",
    "2010 ) , and disagrees with predictions based on kravtsov et al.s ( 2006 ) simulations . however , we caution that the chance probability , @xmath169 , that the correlation coefficient of the two random variables in a sample of 12 drawings , @xmath170 , is higher than the observed one , is not small .",
    "we therefore can not exclude the possibility that the measured correlation between gas mass and temperature residuals is an accident . a larger sample of clusters is needed to achieve definitive results .",
    "* finally , we outlined a new method for constructing a robust low - scatter mass proxy , @xmath171 , calibrated solely by observational data , based on a principal component analysis .",
    "this is a generalization of the quasi - integrated pressure @xmath145 , proposed by kravtsov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in principle , a combination of the principal component analysis and the method for measuring the covariance of intrinsic scatter could be applied to multi - dimensional data sets in order to construct robust new mass proxy .",
    "our future program will concentrate on expanding the sample of clusters for which high quality subaru and _ xmm - newton _ data are available , in order to achieve definitive results on the issues raised in this article .",
    "key issues will include improvement of the statistical uncertainties on the scaling relation fits , characterizing more fully the influence of extreme merging clusters on the scaling relations , and exploring the balance between physical and orientation effects in causing the observed structural segregation in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 relations .",
