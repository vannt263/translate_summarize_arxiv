    "recently , social network has been a popular tool to share images .",
    "when a social network user uploads an image , the image is usually associated with a tag/ keyword which is used to describe the semantic content of this image .",
    "the tags provided by the users are usually incomplete .",
    "zhang et al . designed and implemented a fast motion detection mechanism for multimedia data on mobile and embedded environment @xcite .",
    "recently , the problem image tag completion is proposed in the computer vision and machine learning communities to learn the missing tags of images @xcite .",
    "this problem is defined as the problem of complete the missing elements of a tag vector of a given image automatically .    in this paper , we investigate the problem of image tag completion , and proposed a novel and effective algorithm for this problem based on local linear learning .",
    "we propose a novel and effective tag completion method . instead of completing the missing tag association elements of each image",
    ", we introduce a tag scoring vector to indicate the scores of assigning the image to the tags in a given tag set .",
    "we propose to study the tag scoring vector learning problem in the neighborhood of each image .",
    "for each image in the neighborhood , we propose to learn a linear function to predict a tag scoring vector from a visual feature vector of its corresponding image feature .",
    "we propose to minimize the perdition error measure by the squared @xmath0 norm distance over each neighborhood , and also minimize the squared @xmath0 norm of the linear function parameters .",
    "besides the local linear learning , we also proposed to regularize the learning of tag scoring vectors by the available tags of each image .",
    "we construct a unified objective function to learn both the tag scoring vectors and the local linear functions .",
    "we develop an iterative algorithm to optimize the proposed problem . in each iteration of this algorithm",
    ", we update the tag scoring vectors and the local linear function parameters alternately .",
    "this rest parts of paper are organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] , we introduced the proposed method . in section",
    "[ sec : exp ] , we evaluate the proposed methods on some benchmark data sets . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , the paper is concluded with future works .",
    "we assume that we have a data set of @xmath1 images , and their visual feature vectors are @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4-dimensional feature vector of the @xmath5-th image .",
    "we also assume that we have a set of @xmath6 unique tags , and a tag vector @xmath7^\\top \\in \\{+1,-1\\}^m$ ] for the @xmath5-th image @xmath8 , where @xmath9 if  the  @xmath10-th  tag  is  assigned  to  the  @xmath5-th  image , and @xmath11 , otherwise . in real - world applications , the tag vector of an image @xmath8 is usually incomplete , i.e. , some elements of @xmath12 are missing .",
    "we define a vector @xmath13\\in \\{1,0\\}^m$ ] , where @xmath14 if @xmath15 is available , and @xmath16 if @xmath15 is missing .",
    "we propose to learn a tag scoring vector @xmath17\\in \\mathbb{r}^m$ ] , where @xmath18 is the score of assigning the @xmath10-th tag to the @xmath5-th image .",
    "the set of the @xmath19 nearest neighbor of each image @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath20 , and we assume that the tag scoring vector @xmath21 of a image @xmath22 can be predicted from its visual feature vector @xmath23 using a local linear function @xmath24 ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the parameter of the local linear function . to learn the tag scoring vector and the local function parameters , we propose the following minimization problem ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are tradeoff parameters . the objective function @xmath30 in ( [ equ : obj3 ] ) is a summarization of three terms over all the images in the data set .",
    "the first term , @xmath31 , is the prediction error term of the local linear predictor over the neighborhood of each image .",
    "the second , @xmath32 , is to reduce the complexity of the local linear predictor .",
    "the last term , @xmath33 , is a regularization term to regularize the learning of tag scoring vectors by the incomplete tag vectors , so that the available tags are respected . to optimize the minimization problem in ( [ equ : obj3 ] )",
    ", we propose to use the alternate optimization strategy @xcite in an iterative algorithm .    * * optimization of @xmath34 * in each iteration , we optimize @xmath34 one by one , and the minimization of ( [ equ : obj3 ] ) with respect to @xmath35 can be achieved with the following gradient descent update rule , + @xmath36 + where @xmath37 is the sub - gradient function of @xmath38 , with respect to @xmath35 , + @xmath39 + and @xmath40 is the descent step . * * optimization of @xmath41 * in each iteration , we also optimized @xmath41 one by one . when @xmath42 is optimized , @xmath43 are fixed .",
    "gradient descent method is also employed to update @xmath42 to minimize the objective in ( [ equ : obj3 ] ) , + @xmath44 + where @xmath45 is the sub - gradient function with respect to @xmath42 , + @xmath46",
    "in the experiments , we used two publicly accessed image - tag data sets , which are corel5k data set @xcite and iapr tc12 data set @xcite . in the corel5k data set , there are 4,918 images , and 260 tages .",
    "we extract density feature , harris shift feature , harris hue feature , rgb color feature , and hsv color feature as visual features for each image .",
    "moreover , we remove 40% of the elements of the tag vectors to make the incomplete image tag vectors . in the iapr",
    "tc12 data set , there are 19,062 images , and 291 tags .",
    "we also remove 40% elements of the tag elements to construct the incomplete tag vectors .",
    "to evaluate the tag completion performances , we used the recall - precision curve as performance measure .",
    "we also use mean average precision ( map ) as a single performance measure .",
    "we compared the proposed method to several state - of - the - art tag completion methods , including tag matrix completion ( tmc ) @xcite , linear sparse reconstructions ( lsr ) @xcite , tag completion by noisy matrix recovery ( tcmr)@xcite , and tag completion via nmf ( tc - nmf ) @xcite .",
    "the experimental result on two data sets are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : corel5k ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : iapr ] . from these figures",
    ", we can see that the proposed method loctc performs best .",
    "its recall - precision curve is closer to the top - right corner than any other methods , and its map is also higher than maps of other methods .    in this section , we will study the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to the two parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the curves of @xmath28 and @xmath29 on different data sets are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : corel_alpah ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : iapr_alpah ] . from these figures",
    ", we can see that the performances are stable to different valuse of both @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in this paper , we study the problem of tag completion , and proposed a novel algorithm for this problem . we proposed to learn the tags of images in the neighborhood of each image .",
    "a local linear function is designed to predict the tag scoring vectors of images in each neighborhood , and the prediction function parameter is learned jointly with the tag scoring vectors .",
    "the proposed method is compared to state - of - the - art tag completion algorithms , and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared methods . in the future , we will study how to incorporate these connections into our model and learn more effective tags . in this paper , we used one single local function for each neighborhood , and in the future , we will use more than than regularization to regularized the learning of tags @xcite , such as usage of wavelet functions to construct the local function @xcite .",
    "moreover , correntropy can also be considered as a alternative loss function to construct the local learning problem @xcite . in the future",
    ", we also plan to extend the proposed algorithm for completion of tags of large scale image data set by using high performance computing technology @xcite , and completion of tags of gene / protein functions of bioinformatics problems @xcite .",
