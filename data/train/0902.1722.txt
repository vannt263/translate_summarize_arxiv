    "the smallness of neutrino masses is elegantly explained in the context of seesaw models . since in the standard model ( sm )",
    "neutrinos are massless , new physics is required beyond the model to account for their tiny masses .",
    "the simplest possibility consists of the addition of singlet right - handed neutrinos , which seems natural once all the other fermions in the sm have their right - handed counterparts . in this framework , known as a type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite , neutrinos acquire majorana masses at tree level via a unique dimension - five effective operator .",
    "alternatively , neutrino masses can be generated by a type - ii seesaw  @xcite through the tree - level exchange of @xmath2-triplet scalars , which are color - singlets and carry unit hypercharge .",
    "a third possibility , often referred as type - iii seesaw  @xcite , consists of the introduction of color- singlet @xmath2-triplet fermions with zero hypercharge .    adding to the theory new fermions with chiral couplings to the gauge fields",
    "unavoidably raises the question of anomalies , i.e. the breaking of gauge symmetries of the classical theory at the quantum level . for consistency",
    ", anomalies should be exactly canceled . in the sm",
    "this cancellation occurs for each fermion generation with the hypercharge assignment . on the other hand , in many sm extensions and , particularly , in various grand unified and string models ,",
    "extra @xmath3 factors naturally appear , thus bringing additional anomaly cancellation constraints  @xcite .",
    "these extra factors also typically lead to a richer phenomenology that might have definite signatures at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments .    in this paper",
    "we address the above question in the context of minimal extensions of the sm , based on the gauge structure @xmath4 and coexisting with a seesaw - type mechanism for neutrino masses . in this framework ,",
    "the heavy ( singlet or triplet ) fermions responsible for the seesaw will acquire large majorana masses , after the new gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by singlet scalar fields with nontrivial @xmath0 charges . as it turns out",
    ", the axial - vector  @xcite and mixed gravitational - gauge  @xcite anomaly - free conditions are quite constraining .",
    "furthermore , yukawa interactions , necessary to give masses to sm fermions as well as to implement the seesaw mechanism , restrict the number of higgs doublets required by the theory .",
    "we consider a simple extension of the sm with minimal extra matter content , so that neutrinos obtain seesaw masses and all fields are nontrivially charged under a new @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "we include singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath5 and color - singlet @xmath2-triplet fermions @xmath6 with zero hypercharge to implement type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms , respectively . to give masses to quarks and leptons , 4 higgs doublets ( @xmath7 ) are in general required , while another 2 scalar doublets , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and one @xmath2-triplet scalar @xmath10 are necessary to generate yukawa terms for type - ii and type - iii seesaw mechanisms .",
    "finally , a singlet scalar field @xmath11 is introduced to give majorana masses to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "to render the theory free of anomalies the following set of constraints must be satisfied :    [ an ] @xmath12    where @xmath13 denote the fermion charges under @xmath0 ( the subscript @xmath14 refers to the field ) , @xmath15 is the number of generations , @xmath16 is the number of right - handed neutrinos and @xmath17 is the number of fermionic triplets . equations  ( [ eq : a1])-([eq : a5 ] ) arise from the requirement of the cancellation of the axial - vector anomaly , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : a6 ] ) results from the cancellation of the gravitational - gauge anomaly .    making use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a1])-([eq : a3 ] ) and ( [ eq : a6 ] ) we can express the charges @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in terms of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 as @xmath25 substituting these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) for the @xmath26 anomaly , we derive the condition @xmath27 which , clearly , has only the trivial solutions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is not possible to have an anomaly - free local @xmath32 and , simultaneously , type - i ( @xmath33 ) and type - iii ( @xmath34 ) seesaw models , unless @xmath32 is proportional to the hypercharge @xmath35 , in which case no new gauge symmetry is obtained .",
    "of course , both types of seesaw could coexist if new extra matter content is added to the theory  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , at least two extra singlets charged under @xmath32 are needed to cancel the @xmath26 and @xmath36 anomalies .    once @xmath37 is enforced , the anomaly condition @xmath36 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a5 ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath38\\,.\\ ] ]      if no fermion triplet is introduced and the type - i seesaw mechanism is responsible for neutrino masses , the anomaly constraint @xmath40 implies @xmath41 ( the solution @xmath30 leads to the hypercharge ) .",
    "thus , one right - handed neutrino per generation is required . in this case , all @xmath32 charge assignments can be expressed in terms of the quark doublet charge @xmath42 and the charge ratio @xmath43 , as presented in table  [ tab : sol ] , leading to an infinite class of anomaly - free local @xmath32 symmetries .",
    "note that , in this parametrization , @xmath44 corresponds to the hypercharge and @xmath45 gives the usual @xmath46 gauge symmetry .",
    "any other value of @xmath47 would correspond to a new anomaly - free gauge symmetry .",
    ".[tab : sol ] @xmath32 fermion charges ( normalized with @xmath42 ) as a function of the ratio @xmath48 in different minimal seesaw realizations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      branching ratios of the @xmath49 decays into quarks and muons as a function of the charge ratio  @xmath47.,width=302 ]     @xmath50 plane for type - i and -iii seesaw realizations.,width=302 ]",
    "one of the attractive features of theories with extra @xmath3 gauge symmetries is their richer phenomenology , when compared with the sm .",
    "indeed , the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry leads to new massive neutral gauge bosons @xmath49 ( often called @xmath51 ) which , if kinematically accessible , could be detectable at lhc . in the latter case ,",
    "its decays into third - generation quarks , @xmath52 and @xmath53 could be used to discriminate between different models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the branching ratios of quark to @xmath54 production ,    [ branchratios ] @xmath55    have the advantage of reducing the theoretical uncertainties  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath56 is a constant which depends on qcd and electroweak correction factors .",
    "notice that these ratios depend on the quark and charged lepton @xmath0 charges .",
    "therefore , an analysis of the @xmath50 parameter space would allow one to determine these charges and , in turn , to distinguish the models . using the charge values",
    "given in table  [ tab : sol ] we obtain @xmath57 for the type - i seesaw cases , and @xmath58 for the type - iii seesaw case . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the above branching ratios indeed allow one to discriminate among the models .",
    "the @xmath0 charge ratio @xmath47 as a function of the ratio @xmath59 for vanishing @xmath60 mixing.,width=302 ]    electroweak precision data also severely constrain any mixing with the ordinary @xmath1 boson to the subpercent level  @xcite . in the models under consideration",
    ", the @xmath60 mixing appears due to the presence of higgs bosons which transforms under the sm gauge group and the new @xmath0 abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "generically , such mixing is proportional to the combination  @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the gauge couplings , and @xmath63 are the vacuum expectation values of the higgs doublets with @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the requirement of vanishing @xmath60 mixing imposes an additional constraint on the @xmath0 charges .",
    "in particular , for minimal setups with only two higgs doublets , it is possible to determine @xmath47 as a function of a single ratio , e.g. @xmath59 . for type - i",
    "seesaw with @xmath41 together with type - ii seesaw , we find @xmath65 while a type - i seesaw with only 2 right - handed neutrinos yields @xmath66 finally , a type - iii seesaw realization implies @xmath67 once again , the different models are clearly distinguishable , as can be seen from fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "in summary , we have implemented minimal seesaw realizations in extensions of the sm with a local @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we have shown that type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms can not be simultaneously realized , unless the @xmath0 symmetry is a replica of the standard hypercharge or new fermionic fields are added to the theory . when combined type - i / ii or type - iii / ii seesaw models are considered , we have seen that it is always possible to assign nontrivial anomaly - free charges to the fields .",
    "the lhc era is an exceptional opportunity to explore and discover physics beyond the sm .",
    "the minimal seesaw models studied here are well - motivated ( nonsupersymmetric ) extensions of the sm",
    ". the discovery of a new neutral gauge boson with a mass up to a few tev and typical electroweak scale couplings would be one of the first evidences of a new tev scale sector .",
    "we have demonstrated how the gauge boson signatures at lhc , like its decays into third - generation quarks and mixing with the ordinary @xmath1 boson , could allow one to constrain these seesaw models and discriminate among them . furthermore , these indirect seesaw signatures have the advantage of being independent of the yukawa interactions of the heavy neutrino fields with the sm charged leptons .",
    "the latter interactions are expected to be very suppressed and lead to unobservable production rates of the heavy fields , if the extra @xmath3 gauge symmetry is broken at tev energies . in this scenario , the seesaw mechanism could still be natural if some flavor symmetries that correctly reproduce the light neutrino masses , while keeping sizable yukawa couplings , are invoked  @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is much more phenomenology with the seesaw than the one considered here . in particular ,",
    "when the decays of @xmath49 to heavy majorana neutrinos are kinematically allowed , like - sign dilepton signals offer another interesting possibility for studying the physics of new gauge bosons at lhc  @xcite .",
