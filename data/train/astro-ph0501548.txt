    "the population of known extrasolar planets which transit the face of their parent stars has been growing steadily in recent years .",
    "it currently includes @xcite , ogle - tr-56b @xcite , ogle - tr-113b @xcite , ogle - tr-132b @xcite , tres-1 @xcite , ogle - tr-111b @xcite and ogle - tr10b @xcite . for , the transit lightcurve was observed with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ to be symmetric around its centroid to an exquisite photometric precision of @xmath7 magnitude per data point for a few hundred data points tracing both ingress and egress @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we show that transit lightcurves must have a time - reversal asymmetry even if the star and the planet are perfectly symmetric and the orbit is circular .",
    "the asymmetry originates from the persistent acceleration of the planet towards the star during the transit . for a circular orbit",
    ", the planet moves towards the observer at the beginning of the transit ( ingress ) and away from the observer at its end ( egress ) .",
    "this net acceleration introduces a change in the relative rate by which ingress and egress advance in the observer s frame of reference .",
    "the effect simply follows from the unsteady change in the propagation delay of photons which distorts the transformation of time between the planet and the observer .",
    "the variation rate of the delay is changing most rapidly at the middle of the transit when the full newtonian acceleration vector points straight along the line - of - sight . in the following sections , we derive the magnitude of the resulting lightcurve asymmetry (  2 ) and discuss its implications (  3 ) .",
    "the observed arrival time of photons @xmath8 is given by the time they left the planet @xmath9 plus the propagation delay over the distance of the planet @xmath10 , @xmath11 the @xmath9-derivative of equation  ( [ eq : doppler ] ) gives @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity of the planet along the line - of - sight .",
    "since @xmath14 changes from negative to positive during the transit of a planet in a circular orbit , it is now obvious that ingress would advance at a faster rate ( i.e. a shorter @xmath15 per @xmath16 interval ) than egress .",
    "figure 1 illustrates schematically this generic behaviour .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : deriv ] ) is accurate to all orders in @xmath17 but we will keep only first order terms in subsequent derivations .",
    "even though the planet is not emitting the observed photons , the timing of its occultation is dictated by the instant at which stellar photons graze its outer surface ; this timing is distorted by the same propagation delay effect that would exist if the grazing photons were emitted by the planet itself rather than the star since the propagation history of the photons before they graze the planet s boundary is irrelevant .",
    "the transverse spatial coordinates of the planet orbit , @xmath18 , are the same in the observer and planet reference frames .",
    "the apparent transverse velocity of the planet is therefore different from its actual transverse velocity , @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 where the transverse position vector @xmath18 corresponds to angular coordinates on the sky times the distance to the planetary system . throughout our discussion ,",
    "the terms parallel ( @xmath21 ) or transverse ( @xmath22 ) are relative to the line - of - sight axis that starts at the observer and goes through the center of the stellar image .",
    "we focus on the time when the occulting planet crosses this spatial point of symmetry .    taking the @xmath8derivative of both sides of equation  ( [ eq : velocity ] ) and keeping terms to leading - order in @xmath23 , we get two new contributions to the difference between the observed and keplerian values of the transverse acceleration of the planet across the sky @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the observed acceleration and @xmath26 is the actual keplerian acceleration of the planet .",
    "the last term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : acceleration ] ) implies that the apparent _ transverse _ acceleration of the planet gets a contribution from its keplerian acceleration _ along _ the line - of - sight , @xmath27 .",
    "this term is the source of our effect .    for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the orbital plane is viewed edge - on by the observer ; this geometry is exact for transits that cross the center of the star ( `` central transits '' ) and is a very good approximation more generally as long as the orbital radius is much larger than the radius of the star . for a circular planetary orbit ,",
    "newtonian dynamics implies no transverse acceleration of the planet at the spatial center of symmetry of the transit where @xmath28 here @xmath2 is the stellar mass and @xmath3 is the planet s orbital radius .",
    "however , equation  ( [ eq : acceleration ] ) implies that at the same time there would be an apparent transverse deceleration of the planet in the observer s frame of reference @xmath29 which is directed opposite to @xmath30 .",
    "this persistent apparent deceleration implies that the planet would cross ingress and egress at different apparent rates .",
    "thus , even if the stellar image is perfectly symmetric , the orbit is circular and the planet is perfectly spherical , there is an inherent asymmetry in the transit lightcurve due to the nearly steady value of @xmath31 during the transit .",
    "newtonian dynamics alone predicts a non - vanishing @xmath32 as soon as the planet moves away from the transit center , but for a circular orbit this deviation would maintain the time - reversal symmetry between ingress and egress .",
    "the fractional asymmetry in the transit lightcurve is of order the fractional change in @xmath33 over the transit duration , since the rates by which ingress and egress proceed are proportional to @xmath33 . for",
    "a total transit duration @xmath34 and an orbital period @xmath35 , the slope of the initial drop and final rise in the transit lightcurve will differ by a fractional amplitude @xmath36 for a `` hot jupiter '' like , the ingress phase ( @xmath37 ) would proceed at a rate that is higher by fractional amplitude of @xmath7 than the egress phase ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "planets that are closer in by a factor of a few could produce an asymmetry of up to @xmath39 ; ogle - tr-56b for which @xmath40 provides @xmath41 [ see @xcite for a compilation of all known transit systems and the prospects for detecting others ] .",
    "the observed time @xmath8 is a slightly distorted version of the time axis @xmath9 along which the lightcurve is symmetric .",
    "we may write @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and we shifted @xmath44 to be at the transit centroid .",
    "the observed photon flux , @xmath45 , corresponds to the flux at an undistorted time @xmath46 $ ] , while @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath48=-t_{\\rm obs}[1+\\epsilon(t)]$ ] . for small deviations",
    ", we may expand the photon flux as a function of time to leading order , @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , the time - dependent photometric asymmetry of the lightcurve is given by @xmath53 where we have set @xmath54 at the transit centroid ( for which @xmath55 ) and kept terms to leading order in @xmath56 .",
    "given a preliminary transit lightcurve , @xmath45 , and an approximate knowledge of the system parameters , it is possible to predict the lightcurve asymmetry under the assumption of a circular orbit .",
    "figure 2 shows the expected @xmath57 for based on the lightcurve data in @xcite .",
    "for a transit depth of @xmath58 magnitudes produced by a close - in planet , the net photometric asymmetry would typically amount to a few percent of @xmath59 or equivalently to a peak value of @xmath60 in the range of ( 0.11)@xmath61 .",
    "the photometric sensitivity of @xmath7 magnitudes per data point achieved with _ hst _ for @xcite provides a net sensitivity to a time - reversal asymmetry of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the total number of independent data points during ingress and egress .",
    "our effect appears to be on the borderline of being detectable with existing techniques .",
    "a statistically significant ( @xmath64 ) detection of the asymmetry in equation  ( [ eq : min ] ) for would require an additional order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity , which is achievable with future space missions such as _ kepler _ or _ corot _ and only marginally with the existing instrument _",
    "most_. a simple way to reach the required sensitivity would be to maintain the existing photometric precision per data point and increase the number of data points from @xmath65 up to @xmath66 ( e.g. by increasing the number of transits from the 4 observed by _ hst _ to @xmath67 ) over a period of several years .",
    "the orbital period scales as @xmath5 while the fractional asymmetry in equation  ( [ eq : min ] ) scales as @xmath68 .",
    "thus , detection of the lightcurve asymmetry would allow to determine @xmath2 and @xmath3 separately .",
    "additional data on the reflex motion of the star would then provide the planet mass , @xmath69 , based on dynamical information alone .",
    "currently , the stellar mass , @xmath2 , is inferred indirectly based on theoretical fitting of the stellar spectrum which is subject to modeling uncertainties at the level of @xmath70 [ see fig . 3 in @xcite ] .    if the planetary orbit is nearly circular but has a finite eccentricity , @xmath71 , then it is easy to show that at the transit center @xmath72 to leading order in @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the angle between the shortest radius vector of the orbital ellipse ( along the apsidal line ) and the line to the observer .",
    "as long as @xmath75 , the eccentricity effect is smaller than the propagation delay effect in equation  ( [ eq : dopa ] ) . in the absence of perturbers ,",
    "any initial orbital eccentricity is expected to decay exponentially through tidal dissipation on an e  folding timescale @xcite @xmath76 where the quality parameter @xmath77 ( @xmath78 for jupiter ) is inversely proportional to the dissipation rate in the planet s interior @xcite , and @xmath79 is the planet s radius .",
    "aside from the unknown @xmath77 , the parameter values in equations ( [ eq : min ] ) and ( [ eq : dis ] ) were chosen to match .",
    "since the orbital circularization timescale is shorter by up to two orders of magnitude than the age of planetary systems such as hd 209458 [ @xmath80 gyr , see @xcite and @xcite ] , the eccentricity - driven asymmetry is expected to diminish for a close - in planet unless a third body pumps its orbital eccentricity .",
    "incidentally , such a perturber was hypothesized as the driver of the inflated radius of @xcite but its existence has not been demonstrated yet .    for close - in planets such as",
    ", our effect is larger than a different source of lightcurve asymmetry that was already discussed in the literature , namely the planet s obliquity @xcite .",
    "this is because close - in planets are expected to rotate slowly and possess a small projected obliquity as a result of strong tidal locking with their orbital revolution .",
    "their rotation axis is expected to be normal to their orbital plane which is viewed nearly edge - on [ in the case of , the orbital inclination angle is @xmath81 @xcite ] .",
    "another source of asymmetry is rotation of the star .",
    "typical projected rotation speeds of @xmath82 @xcite would produce a doppler offset @xcite between the flux emitted by the approaching and receding sides of the star of order @xmath83 [ the photometric analog of the _ rossiter - mclaughlin effect _ ; see @xcite ] , or an occultation contrast of @xmath84 magnitudes which is much smaller than the effect considered here .",
    "if the stellar rotation axis is significantly misaligned with the normal of the orbital plane and the transit is not central , then the rotation - induced oblateness of the stellar image could generate a fractional ( @xmath59equivalent ) asymmetry of less than @xmath85 , which is again well below our effect for where the misalignment angle must be small @xcite .",
    "the propagation delay relation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in equation ( [ eq : doppler ] ) can be easily incorporated into a computer program that searches for the best - fit keplerian orbit under the constraints of a given data set .",
    "the _ delay ",
    "corrected _ keplerian fit would provide new dynamical constraints on the planetary system .",
    "such a fit would involve the same number of free parameters as the standard keplerian fit .",
    "we have shown that the propagation delay of light introduces an _ apparent _ transverse deceleration of a planet on the sky during its transit across the face of its parent star ( eq .",
    "[ eq : dopa ] ) .",
    "this persistent deceleration breaks the time - reversal symmetry of the transit lightcurve for a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a spherical star . throughout the transit",
    ", the planet velocity along the line - of - sight , @xmath14 , is changing at a nearly steady rate , @xmath86 .",
    "this produces a steady change in the transformation of time to the observer s frame ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : deriv ] ) .",
    "the net change in @xmath14 between ingress and egress , @xmath87 , introduces a fractional difference of magnitude @xmath88 in the slopes of their lightcurves .",
    "it is possible to search for this difference in slopes by folding the lightcurve over its centroid . for close - in planets",
    ", ingress should typically proceed at a rate that is faster by a fractional amplitude @xmath89@xmath1 than egress ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : min ] ) .",
    "this level of asymmetry will be detectable with forthcoming space telescopes such as _ corot _ or _",
    "@xcite , which are scheduled for launch within 2 - 3 years .",
    "because this asymmetry has a unique scaling with stellar mass and orbital radius ( @xmath90 ) , its detection together with the reflex motion of the star will allow to determine the star and planet masses as well as the orbital radius using purely dynamical data .",
    "this method evades the theoretical uncertainties inherent in the existing approach for determining stellar masses based on modeling of spectroscopic data [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "orbital eccentricity could induce a stronger asymmetry in the lightcurve but is expected to decay exponentially to negligible levels through tidal dissipation for close - in planets like , unless it is being pumped by the gravitational perturbation of another planet .",
    "similarly to other transit timing residuals @xcite , our effect would be contaminated by noise from inhomogeneities on the face of the star and would compete against other small effects involving asymmetries from the oblateness of the planet @xcite or the rotation of the star .",
    "additional special - relativistic or general - relativistic effects are of the order of @xmath91 or @xmath92 , or smaller , where @xmath93 is the gravitational potential produced by the star ( @xmath94 ) ; these corrections are orders of magnitude smaller than the propagation delay effect discussed here .",
    "finally , we note that a change of the opposite sign in @xmath14 occurs when the planet goes behind the star . in this case",
    ", ingress would be slower than egress .",
    "there is no net change in the orbital period over a full closed orbit .",
    "however when the planet enters its own ( secondary ) eclipse by the star , the photons it emits will be delayed relative to primary eclipse ( the transit ) by the difference in emission times plus the light travel time across the orbital diameter , as implied by equation  ( [ eq : doppler ] ) . for a circular orbit , the time interval between the centroids of the primary and secondary",
    "eclipses would be longer by @xmath95 than half of the full orbital period .",
    "future detection of a planet s infrared emission would then allow to determine the orbital radius from the light propagation delay of @xmath96 seconds .",
    "the full orbital period @xmath97 would then yield the stellar mass through @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "an eccentricity could change the lightcurve history of the illuminated planet and in particular make the time from primary eclipse to secondary eclipse different from the time back to primary eclipse .",
