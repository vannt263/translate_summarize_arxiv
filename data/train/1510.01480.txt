    "bloch oscillations ( bos ) , i.e. the oscillatory motion of a quantum particle in a periodic potential driven by a constant force , are one of the most striking effects of coherent quantum transport in the matter . originally studied in the context of electrons in crystals @xcite , they have been observed in a wide variety of different physical systems such as semiconductor superlattices @xcite , ultracold atomic gases @xcite , optical and acoustical waves @xcite . in the simplest semiclassical picture ,",
    "bos can be explained from the ehrenfest equations of motion taking into account the periodic band structure of the crystal @xcite . in particular , owing to the so - called acceleration theorem the momentum distribution of the particle moves in momentum space at a constant speed while preserving its shape @xcite . as a result , for a wave packet with narrow momentum distribution the oscillation trajectory of the particle wave packet in physical space exactly reproduces the shape of the lattice band dispersion curve . in the spectral domain ,",
    "bos are ascribed to the transition of the energy spectrum from a continuous band with delocalized bloch eigenstates in absence of the external force to a discrete ladder spectrum with localized wannier - stark ( ws ) eigenstates @xcite when the external force is applied and zener tunneling among different lattice bands is negligible @xcite .",
    "several studies have extended bos to include the role of lattice disorder @xcite , nonlinearities @xcite , lattice defects and quasicrystals @xcite , inhomogeneous fields @xcite , particle interaction and correlation @xcite , bos of nonclassical states of light @xcite , long - range hoppings @xcite , etc .",
    "more recently , the onset of bos have been investigated in lattices with a complex periodic potential @xcite , so - called complex crystals @xcite including those with parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the observation of bos in complex crystals , reported in the landmark experiment of ref.@xcite using light waves in @xmath0-symmetric synthetic lattices , has raised the interest into the coherent transport properties in non - hermitian lattices",
    ". some peculiar properties of non - hermitian bos have been disclosed , such as the occurrence of complex ws ladders @xcite , unidirectional bos at the symmetry breaking transition @xcite arising from one - way bragg scattering @xcite , and periodic bos at exceptional points in spite of lattice truncation @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the acceleration theorem and semiclassical picture of bos for wave packets in ordinary lattices can be extended ( and to what extent ) to complex crystals . for the case",
    "where the imaginary part of the potential can be regarded as a perturbation to the real potential or whenever the band spectrum remains real in spite of the complex potential , the wave packet in real space undergoes an oscillatory trajectory like in the hermitian case , except that bos are damped or amplified depending on the sign of the force @xcite .",
    "however , in strongly non - hermitian potentials the band structure can become imaginary , and in this case it is not clear whether and how the semiclassical picture of bos can be extended to account for a complex energy lattice band .",
    "several examples of tight - binding lattice models that show a non - vanishing imaginary part of the band dispersion curve have been discussed in many works , including the hatano - nelson model describing the hopping motion of a quantum particle in a linear tight - binding lattice with an imaginary vector potential @xcite , the non - hermitian extension of the su - schrieffer - heeger tight - binding model @xcite , @xmath0-symmetric binary superlattices @xcite , and the @xmath0-symmetric aubry - andre model @xcite .",
    "lattice bands with a non vanishing imaginary part could be realized in synthetic temporal optical crystals , waveguide lattices , coupled - resonator optical waveguides , microwave resonator chains , etc . as discussed in several recent works @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we aim to investigate the onset of bos in non - hermitian lattices with a non vanishing imaginary part of the band dispersion curve .",
    "our analysis discloses that the ordinary wisdom of bos that uses a semiclassical description can not be trivially extended to non - hermitian lattices when the band dispersion curve has a non vanishing imaginary part .",
    "in particular , we show that the acceleration theorem ( i.e. the uniform drift in the momentum space of the wave packet distribution ) holds only on average , whereas in real space a particle wave packet with narrow spectral distribution undergoes a periodic motion _ but _ following a closed orbit in _ complex _ plane . as a result ,",
    "strong wave packet reshaping is generally observed within each bo cycle , in addition to the transverse oscillatory motion .",
    "we exemplify the concept of bos involving complex trajectories by considering the onset of bos in two nearest - neighbor tight - binding lattice models with a complex energy band dispersion curve , including the hatano - nelson model describing the hopping motion of a quantum particle on a linear lattice with an imaginary vector potential . in such a case",
    ", it is shown that the bo motion of a particle wave packet corresponds to an elliptical orbit in the complex plane and the trajectory followed by a wave packet in real space can not be merely predicted by the real part solely ( group velocity ) of the energy dispersion relation . + the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly review the semiclassical approach to bos in ordinary crystals , and highlight the difficulties to extend such a simple picture to bos in lattices described by an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "the exact analysis of bos is presented in sec.iii , where an extension of the acceleration theorem is derived and the concept of complex trajectories is introduced .",
    "two examples illustrating the onset of bos in lattice models with a complex energy band are presented in sec.iv , whereas the main conclusions are outlined in sec.v .",
    "in this section we briefly review the simple semiclassical model that describes bos as introduced for ordinary crystals , and show the limitations that arise when trying to extend such an analysis to complex crystals .",
    "we consider the motion of a quantum particle in a one - dimensional periodic potential with lattice period @xmath1 driven by an external constant force @xmath2 . as is well - known , for a weak force zener tunneling among different bands is negligible and a single - band model can be used to describe the onset of bos and the formation of ws localized states within each band @xcite . indicating by @xmath3 the wannier state of the lattice band that localizes the particle at site @xmath4 of the lattice @xcite , after expanding the particle wave function @xmath5 as @xmath6 , the evolution equations for the site occupation probabilities read ( taking @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where @xmath2 is the external driving force and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are the hopping rates among different lattice sites.the dispersion relation @xmath11 of the lattice band is given by the relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bloch wave number .",
    "note that the constant @xmath14 just provides an energy bias of the lattice band , and it will be taken to be zero in the following analysis for the sake of definiteness . in an hermitian lattice , @xmath15 and the energy dispersion curve @xmath16 is a real function , whereas for a non - hermitian lattice @xmath16 can become complex .",
    "as is well known , the solution to the tight - binding equations ( 1 ) can be expressed as @xmath17 , where the function @xmath18 satisfies the continuous schrdinger equation @xmath19 with the _ effective _ hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the momentum operator and @xmath16 is the band dispersion relation defined by the fourier expansion ( 2 ) .      in an ordinary crystal ,",
    "the onset of bos for a wave packet with a narrow spectral distribution is generally explained on the basis of the ehrenfest equations derived from the effective hamiltonian ( 3 ) , that describe the evolution of mean position ( in units of the lattice period @xmath1 ) and momentum distributions of the particle wave function .",
    "such equations read explicitly @xmath22 \\rangle= i \\langle   \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial q } ( \\hat{p}_x ) \\rangle \\\\",
    "i \\frac{d \\langle \\hat{p}_x \\rangle}{dt } & = & \\langle [ \\hat{p_x } , \\hat{h } ] \\rangle =- i f.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq.(5 ) it follows that the mean particle momentum @xmath23 drifts in time with a constant speed @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath24 a relation generally referred to as the acceleration theorem in its simplest version @xcite .",
    "moreover , provided that the momentum distribution remains narrow in the evolution , the approximation @xmath25 in eq.(4 ) can be introduced , yielding @xmath26 since @xmath16 is periodic with period @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 , it follows that in real space the particle wave packet undergoes an oscillatory motion , at the bo frequency @xmath29 , along a path that reproduces the band dispersion curve of the lattice [ according to eq.(7 ) ] .",
    "+ the question is whether such a simple semiclassical analysis of bos can be extended to the case of a complex lattice with a band dispersion relation @xmath16 which is complex - valued , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of the band dispersion curve . it should be noted that , as we will rigorously prove in the next section , even though the energy spectrum @xmath16 of the lattice is complex , as soon as @xmath33 a real ws ladder energy spectrum is obtained , corresponding to a periodic motion at the bo frequency @xmath29 like in an ordinary crystal . however , the extension to the non - hermitian case of the semiclassical analysis is a nontrivial issue and it is actually not much helpful .",
    "the reasons thereof are that , since the effective hamiltonian @xmath34 is now non - hermitian , ( i ) the norm of the wave packet @xmath35 is not conserved , and ( ii ) the ehrenfest equations are modified taking into account the commutation / anti - commutaion relations of the hermitian and anti - hermitian parts of @xmath34 .",
    "namely , for any self - adjoint operator @xmath36 corresponding to an observable @xmath37 that does not explicitly depend on time , after introduction of the expectation value of @xmath36 defined as @xmath38 it can be readily shown that @xmath39 \\rangle+ \\langle [ \\hat{a},\\hat{h}_2]_+ \\rangle",
    "-2 \\langle \\hat{a}(t ) \\rangle \\langle \\hat{h}_2 \\rangle.\\ ] ] to derive eq.(9 ) , we introduced the following decomposition of the effective hamiltonian @xmath34 @xmath40 as a sum of the hermitian ( @xmath41 ) and anti - hermitian ( @xmath42 ) parts , with @xcite @xmath43 and indicated by @xmath44=\\hat{a}\\hat{b}-\\hat{b}\\hat{a}$ ] and by @xmath44_+=\\hat{a}\\hat{b}+\\hat{b}\\hat{a}$ ] the commutator and anti - commutator of operators @xmath36 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the extension of the eherenfest equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) to the non - hermitian crystal is obtained from eq.(9 ) by letting either @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting equations are rather cumbersome and are actually not much useful to predict the dynamical evolution of the particle wave packet .",
    "in particular , as compared to the hermitian limit @xmath48 , additional terms , arising from the anticommutator and non - energy conservation terms in eq.(9 ) , do arise in the analysis , which completely destroy the simple solutions ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) and prevent to extend them in the non - hermitian case . as a matter of fact , in a non - hermitian lattice with complex energy dispersion both the acceleration theorem [ as least as stated by eq.(6 ) ] and eq.(7 ) are violated , as discussed in the next section .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of bos in non - hermitian lattices with a complex energy dispersion curve should abandon the simple semiclassical model . the exact analysis , discussed in this section , shows that the following general results hold : + ( i ) for any applied force @xmath33 , the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian is a ws ladder of equally - spaced levels ( energy spacing @xmath29 ) like in an ordinary hermitian crystal ; thus the particle motion is periodic with a period @xmath49 ( ii ) the acceleration theorem holds only _ on average _ in time , namely one has @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mean value of the wave packet distribution in momentum space at time @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a periodic function of time with period @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ; + ( iii ) for a wave packet with initial narrow distribution in momentum space at around @xmath57 , one has under certain smooth conditions @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a path in the complex @xmath60 plane , defined by the relation @xmath61 whereas @xmath62 is a periodic function with period @xmath54 , describing norm oscillation within each bo cycle and given by @xmath63.\\ ] ]      the exact analysis of bos in non - hermitian lattices can be done starting from the tight - binding equations ( 1 ) in the wannier basis extending the procedure used for ordinary lattices .",
