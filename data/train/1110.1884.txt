    "each day , millions of conversations , emails , sms , blog posts and comments , instant messages , tweets or web pages containing various types of information are exchanged between people .",
    "humans natural inclination to share information with others in a `` viral '' fashion stems from the need of socializing and seeks to gain reputation , influence , trustworthiness or popularity @xcite .",
    "such viral dissemination of information through social networks , commonly known as `` word - of - mouth '' ( wom ) , is of paramount importance in our everyday life .",
    "in fact , it is known to influence purchasing decisions to the extent that 2/3 of the united states economy is driven by those kind of personal recommendations @xcite .",
    "wom is also important to understand sales and customer value @xcite , opinion formation or rumor spreading in social networks @xcite or to determine the influence of each person in its social neighborhood @xcite . despite its importance and due to the difficulty ( or inability ) to capture this phenomenon , detailed empirical data on how humans disseminate information are scarce @xcite , population aggregated @xcite or indirect @xcite .",
    "moreover , most studies have concentrated on asymptotical stationary properties of information difussion @xcite .",
    "this has hampered the study of the dynamics of information diffusion and indeed most of its understanding comes from theoretical propagation models running on empirical or synthetic social networks in an approach borrowed from epidemiology @xcite . in those models , information diffusion equates to the propagation of virus or diseases that spontaneously pass to others by contagion through the active social connections of the infected ( i.e. informed ) agents .",
    "however , information diffusion mechanisms are fundamentally different from those operating in disease spreading . in fact , passing a message along has a perceived transmission cost , its targets are consciously selected among potentially interested individuals @xcite , depends on human volition and , ultimately , is executed on the individuals activity schedule . an obvious implication of those peculiarities is that information spreading is bound to depend on the large variability observed both on the volume and frequency of human activities and on the perceived value / cost of transmitting the information .",
    "for example , the number of emails sent by individuals per day @xcite , the number of telephone calls placed by users @xcite , the number of blog entries by user @xcite , the number of web page clicks per user @xcite , and the number of a person s social relationships @xcite or sexual contacts @xcite show large demographic stochasticity .",
    "in fact these numbers are distributed according to a power - law ( or pareto ) distribution , inconsistent with the mild gaussian or poissonian stochasticity around population - averaged values traditionally assumed in epidemiological models @xcite .",
    "the same large variability pattern applies to the human activities time dynamics : for example , email response delays , market trading frequencies or inter - event time of web page visits , telephone calls , etc .",
    "are well described by power - law or log - normal distributions @xcite .",
    "recent research has shown that such high variability in human behavior alters substantially the temporal dynamics of information diffusion and does not merely introduce some stochasticity in population - averaged models @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to incorporate this human behavior into the models .    besides , information diffusion travels through social connections thereby depending on the properties of the social networks where it spreads .",
    "for example , simulations on synthetic scale - free networks showed that if information flowed through every social connection the epidemic threshold would be significantly lowered to the extent that it could disappear @xcite , so that any rumor , virus or innovation might reach a large fraction of individuals in the population no matter how small the probability of being infected .",
    "given the fact that social networks are scale - free @xcite those results predict that there is a strong interplay between network structure and the spreading process .",
    "however such is not the case for information spreading processes .",
    "our daily experience indicates that most rumors , innovations or marketing messages do not reach a significant part of the population @xcite . as mentioned earlier , the information transmission perceived cost prevents it from traveling inexpensively through all possible network paths .",
    "therefore when participants assess the value of the information being passed , the impact of their social network structure on the diffusion process might be diminished .",
    "unfortunately the true extent of such influence remains unknown in general .",
    "moreover , the reach of information can be affected by the dynamics of human communication @xcite and thus it is important to understand the interplay between the static and dynamical properties of information diffusion .    finally , there is an important shortcoming in the data currently available to investigate those questions .",
    "the vast majority of the large amount of data collected on information exchanges , for example email , sms , calls or tweets , lacks the details required to follow the dynamics of a specific content item at the individual s level ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the behavioral stochasticity of the individuals caused by the message content is masked and observations are limited to people s stochasticity due to the transmission media .",
    "a representative example of this difficulty is the study of communication patterns in mobile phone calls @xcite in which every communication , regardless of the message , is used to partially discover the social relationships network through which potential messages will spread but is not capable of revealing the specific dynamics of a particular piece of information . in other cases , data is not available at the individual participant level but just as population averaged metrics @xcite thereby hiding that different content items elicit diverse task prioritization in a given person or social segment .",
    "the situation is clearly unsatisfactory since , to our knowledge and possibly because of privacy concerns or data proprietorship , there are not very many data sets tracing the propagation of a specific piece of content throughout the social network ( see however @xcite ) .    to overcome those limitations in the understanding of electronic information diffusion , we present here the results of a series of controlled viral marketing campaigns , the commercial form of wom @xcite , that we conducted in eleven european countries . in them",
    "subscribers of a business online newsletter received incentives for recommending the newsletter subscription to their acquaintances .",
    "the detailed tracking of those recommendations revealed the factors impacting the diffusion dynamics of that particular piece of information at every step and suggested a branching process as the mechanism driving the dynamics of information diffusion .",
    "thus the bellman - harris branching model , a generalization of the static percolation model introduced by newman @xcite for contagion propagation in networks , accurately describes our viral marketing campaigns . in particular",
    ", this branching model explains information diffusion of information in random networks and constitutes the simplest approach incorporating the human behavior high variability patterns both in activity volume and in response time .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : experiments ] introduces our viral marketing campaigns and the information viral diffusion mechanism used in them , while subsections [ sec : data ] and [ sec : results ] , respectively , present the campaigns propagation results data set and analyze the observed diffusion dynamics patterns and social connectivity found in such propagation . section [ sec : model ] follows with the analytical formulation of the bellman - harris branching model which includes detailed discussion of its phase transitions , asymptotic properties and time dynamics while section [ sec : examples ] studies several examples of its application to several scenarios of the response time distribution in the information propagation .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "finally , appendix a discusses aspects of the substrate social network structure that can be gleaned through the information propagation process .",
    "we tracked and measured the `` word - of - mouth '' diffusion of viral marketing campaigns ran in eleven european markets that invited subscribers of an it company online newsletter to promote new subscriptions among friends and colleagues .",
    "campaign participants received incentives for spreading the offering through recommendation emails .",
    "the campaigns were fully web based .",
    "banner ads , emails , search engines and the company web page drove participants to the campaign offering site .",
    "there , participants could fill in a referral form with names and email addresses of those to whom they recommended subscribing the newsletter .",
    "the submission of this form launched recommendation emails including a link to the campaign main page whose automatically generated url was appended with codes allowing the web server to uniquely assign clicks on it to the sender and receiver of the corresponding email .",
    "the form , allowing up to four referrals per submission , checked destination email addresses for syntax correctness and to avoid self - recommendations .",
    "cookies prevented multiple recommendations to the same address and improved usability by automatically filling - in sender s data in subsequent visits to the submission form .",
    "additionally , the campaign server logged the time stamp of each step of the process ( subscription , recommendation submission ) and removed from records undeliverable recommendations .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand",
    ", it makes sense to assume that the number of recommendations sent by _",
    "secondary spreaders _ ( including not sending any ) results from a decision by each message recipient that involves a trade - off between the message forwarding cost and its perceived value . for our campaigns lottery prize for example , and",
    "in a population average approach , a reasonable proxy of the perceived value of winning the prize for residents in a given country could be the fraction of the average income of its citizens represented by the prize cost in that market .",
    "granted , there may be many other factors at play in the formation of such perception , but there is a very significant correlation ( @xmath0 ) between the average income and the average number of recommendations @xmath1 sent by _",
    "secondary spreaders _ in each market which indicates that the expected gain average relative size may be one of them ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "additionally , the human intervention in such decision process is at the root of a very unique property of the dynamics of information diffusion . comparing viral campaigns parameters in different markets ( see table [ table2 ] ) ,",
    "we observe a wide range of values in their respective information propagation dynamical parameters .",
    "since the campaigns execution was identical in all markets , those variations can only be due to a change in perception of the viral offering value and/or of the message forwarding cost by customers in each market .",
    "interestingly , variations of the _ transmissibility _",
    "( @xmath2 ) and the _ fanout coefficient _ ( @xmath1 ) present a pearson coefficient @xmath3 as evidence of a very strong dependence between them .",
    "we proved in @xcite that such dependence has the form @xmath4 which reduces to @xmath5 @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "this peculiarity of information diffusion processes , not observed in disease epidemics , arises because the decisions of becoming a spreader and of the number of viral messages to send are simultaneously made by each participant which introduces correlation in their averages .      in a first approximation",
    "we could analyze information dynamics by studying the basic reproductive number @xmath8 of epidemiology , the average number of secondary cases generated by each virally informed individual , which results from the definition of the dynamical parameters as @xmath9 . however , average quantities like @xmath10 hide the heterogeneous nature of epidemics @xcite and also of information diffusion .",
    "in fact our campaigns show that most of the observed transmission occurs due to extraordinary events .",
    "in particular , we get that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the number of recommendations sent is well approximated by the harris discrete distribution @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a normalization constant so that @xmath13 .",
    "this function displays a power - law behavior @xmath14 in its tail starting approximately at the cutoff point @xmath15 .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists the distribution parameters for _ seeds _ ( @xmath16 ) , _ viral _ ( @xmath17 ) and",
    "total _ active _ ( @xmath18 ) nodes while fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] shows the probability distribution of the recommendations sent by _ active _ nodes in all markets , and the comparison to the probability predicted by a poisson discrete distribution with mean @xmath19 , same as that of the empirical data .",
    "the markedly different behavior between both of them indicates the high probability of finding individuals making a large number of recommendations .",
    "as noted in the introduction , such high demographic stochasticity , observed in many other human activities @xcite , suggests that humans response to a particular task can not be described by close - to - average models where they are all assumed to behave in a similar fashion with some small degree of demographic stochasticity @xcite . in sharp contrast with population homogeneous models of information spreading , we found that 2% of the active population in our viral campaigns has @xmath20 suggesting the existence of super - spreading individuals .",
    "super - spreading individuals have also been found in non - sexual disease spreading @xcite where they significantly increase outbreak sizes . in a similar manner ,",
    "the sizes of the information cascades found in our campaigns indicate that super - spreading individuals are responsible for making large viral cascades rarer but more explosive .",
    "the probability distribution of the campaigns cascades sizes , represented ( see fig .",
    "[ casc ] ) , is also a fat - tailed distribution ( in fact , the tail can be fitted to a power law @xmath21 with @xmath22 ) .",
    "in contrast , neglecting the existence of super - spreading individuals but still considering some degree of stochasticity in the number of recommendations by assuming @xmath18 is a poisson distribution with the same average , a cascade like the one in fig . [ cascade ] would have an occurrence probability of approximately once every @xmath23 _ seed _ nodes , a number much larger than the total world population ( see fig . [ casc ] ) .",
    "an element to consider in the aforementioned spreading stochasticity is the impact , if any , of the underlying social network heterogeneity in a similar way to that of the connectivity of a computer network on the diffusion of computer viruses @xcite .",
    "social networks data reveals that humans show large variability in their number of social contacts @xcite .",
    "thus , the connectivity @xmath24 of email networks whether measured by email traffic or by the users email address books is fat - tailed distributed @xcite . in some cases it is power - law distributed like the number of recommendations in our campaigns .",
    "large variability in the numbers of social contacts has a deep effect on disease spreading @xcite .",
    "in fact , disease spreading models on networks show that if information flows with the same probability through any link in a social network , its topological properties can significantly lower the `` tipping - point '' .",
    "however , while indiscriminate propagation can happen in computer viruses , diseases or other mechanistic processes , the human handling of information diffusion limits the influence of the social network structure : we expect , in general , the number of recommendations to be small compared to the social connectivity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "while in social networks the `` friendship paradox '' @xcite implies that @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 the average number of social contacts of an individual s neighbors and @xmath28 the average number of social contacts of an individual ) , our recommendation network features @xmath29 .",
    "if , as supposed in most models @xcite , information flows through a fraction of the social contacts of an individual , we should have @xmath30 instead .",
    "a way to recover our result is to assume that @xmath31 and @xmath24 are largely independent .",
    "our tree - like diffusion cascades lead to a low undirected clustering coefficient @xcite of the viral _ cascades network _ ( @xmath32 ) compared to the values reported for email social networks ( @xmath33 ) @xcite which supports such assumption .",
    "assuming @xmath31 and @xmath24 independent , we get ( app . [ appa ] ) @xmath34where @xmath27 is the average number of social contacts of the neighbors of an individual .",
    "in social networks @xmath35 is a large number which leads to a very low clustering coefficient even for processes close to the `` tipping - point '' ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this fact explains the unreasonable effectiveness of tree - based theory to explain information diffusion on networks with clustering @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "large heterogeneity of recommendations activity is due to the participants behavior rather than consequence of their connectivity degree which is just the activity upper bound .",
    "finally , another important aspect to consider in the dynamics of information diffusion is the nodes reaction to receiving a message : shall they decide to spread it , how long do they take to do so ?",
    ", for how long do they remain active ?",
    ", and , is their responsiveness correlated in any way to the number of contacts they resend the message to ?",
    "the answer to these questions lies in the increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities , ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns , follow non - poisson statistics , characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity @xcite .",
    "in fact , our campaigns revealed that most of the active nodes turn inactive right after spreading the information once which means that _ viral _ nodes do not remain as spreaders for a long time .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ figti ] shows that for most of the _ viral _ nodes ( actually 97% of them ) , the lapse of time between receiving the message and passing it along @xmath37 equals the interval between receiving the message and the last time it has been resent @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that for the most part _ viral _ nodes show just one spreading event means , from a modeling perspective , that diffusion follows an almost pure `` birth and death '' model . besides , the time dynamics of the viral recommendation process is independent from the number of recommendations @xmath39 sent by",
    "_ viral _ nodes as was shown in @xcite , that is there is no correlation between such number and the response time @xmath37 as evidenced by the pearson correlation coefficient of the two variables ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite , the probability distribution function of the _ viral _ nodes response time @xmath41 is a long tailed log - normal in another evidence of the humans large heterogeneity in wom diffusion . in this sense , participants behave like a sir model in which infection and decay to the recovered state happen at the same time @xcite .",
    "the study of our experimental data leads to a theoretical framework for the process of information diffusion where the dynamics of information viral spreading is explained by tree - like cascades .",
    "each information cascade stems from an initial _ seed _ that starts the viral message propagation with a random number of recommendations distributed as @xmath16 and whose average is @xmath42 .",
    "the individuals reached by the message become _ secondary spreaders _ with probability @xmath2 thereby giving birth to a new generation of _ viral _ nodes which , in turn , propagate the message further with @xmath43 recommendations distributed by @xmath17 with average @xmath44 . after sending their recommendations individuals",
    "become inactive and the process continues stochastically through new individuals in successive generations until none of the members of the latest one spread the message . at that point",
    "the information cascades die out and the propagation ends .",
    "this process corresponds to the well known bellman - harris ( bh ) branching model @xcite which is the simplest mathematical framework to study the branching dynamics of information diffusion .",
    "it generalizes the static and markovian galton - watson model typically used to model information diffusion @xcite or , in general , percolation processes in social networks @xcite .    in the bh model , those two distributions ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath45 ) , represent the number of recommendations sent by _ seed _ and _ viral _ nodes respectively .",
    "the introduction of two different distributions for the recommendations sent by _",
    "seed _ and _ viral _ nodes is not only due to the difference in the average number of recommendations observed in our campaigns ( see table [ table1 ] ) but also because , in general , in social networks the average connectivity of a node s nearest neighbors is higher than the average connectivity of the network nodes themselves . in particular , for completely uncorrelated random networks with distribution of connectivity given by @xmath46 the distribution of the number of connections of the nearest neighbors of a node is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the case in which informed nodes decide not to pass along the information can be incorporated in the recommendations distribution as the case in which the number of messages sent is @xmath48 .",
    "thus we can construct a family of probability distributions of the recommendations sent by nodes @xmath49 where @xmath50 from whence one can obtain the average number of recommendations in the new distributions which are related to the primary and secondary reproductive numbers as @xmath51    to formalize the study of the information spreading branching process , we define now the generating functions @xmath52    moments of the @xmath49 distributions can be obtained through derivatives of the generating functions @xmath53 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the variance of the number of recommendations of _ seed _ nodes .",
    "we will also assume different cdf of response times ( @xmath38 ) for _ seed _ and _ viral _ nodes which we will denote as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "their means are @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "we want to determine the probability distribution of finding @xmath59 nodes active ( i.e. recommending ) at time @xmath60 provided we start with one participant at @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 . to do that we use the following self - consistent argument : since the number of recommendations sent by each _",
    "viral _ node are random independent processes , the branching process starting from each _ viral _ node after a given recommendation , which we denote @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) are independent identically distributed ( iid ) copies of the same process .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ figbh ] the branching process starting from nodes 1 and 2 are iid copies of the same process @xmath63 . but also , the @xmath63 process starting from 1 and the @xmath63 processes starting from 4 and 5 must be statistically the same .",
    "thus we have a self - consistent relationship between the branching process starting at a _ viral _ node and the processes starting from any of its @xmath39 recommendations : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are iid copies of the branching process @xmath67 and assuming that the recommendation event happens at @xmath68 .",
    "note that in this self - consistent equation @xmath39 ( the number of recommendations made by a _",
    "viral _ node and distributed by @xmath69 ) and the time @xmath70 are both random and independent . to describe the process we use generating functions techniques : we define the generating function for @xmath63 as @xmath71 s^{k}$ ] , and thus we get @xmath72   & if\\ t\\geq \\tau \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    finally , since @xmath70 occurs randomly with cdf @xmath73 , one can integrate equation ( [ eq1f1 ] ) over @xmath70 to get @xmath74 + \\!\\ !",

    "of course this is an upper limit to the real `` tipping - point '' since it is based on the assumption that cascades originating from different _ seeds _ do not merge as the propagation progresses which is only valid far from the `` tipping - point '' .",
    "the low average number of recommendations needed to attain the `` tipping - point '' illustrates the limited effect of the social network topology on the viral campaigns efficiency : it is not necessary to forward the message to each participants social contact in order to reach a significant fraction of the network population .",
    "[ tipping ] shows the estimation of our campaigns message propagation `` tipping - point '' based on such findings .",

    "both results show how accurate the model is in predicting the reach of a viral marketing campaign by merely using its dynamic parameters .",
    "moreover , since the values of @xmath2 and @xmath124 can be roughly estimated at the campaign early stages , we could have predicted its final reach at the very beginning .      in the previous subsection we concentrate in the properties of the cascades in the asymptotic regime .",
    "here we come back to the original equations for the dynamics of the nodes ( [ eqf1 ] ) and ( [ eqf0 ] ) to investigate its time dependence . using on them that @xmath125 we get @xmath126 for the dynamics of the average number of infected participants .    once again , the equation for @xmath127 depends on the solution of the integral equation for @xmath128 . actually , for @xmath129 we could explicitly write @xmath130 + ( r_0 / r_1 ) [ i_1(t)-1+g(t)]$ ] .",

    "the resonant case @xmath154 can only happen below the `` tipping - point '' where @xmath155 .",
    "equations ( [ eqpoisson ] ) are the linear growth markovian models typically used to understand the dynamics of information spreading in social networks @xcite . in particular if the number of recommendations depends linearly with the substrate social network connectivity then @xmath156 and thus @xmath157 to recover the result by pastor - satorras and vespignani @xcite that the malthusian parameter @xmath158    thus , if the social connectivity has a distribution which is fat tailed then @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "moreover we recover the result of @xcite in which the malthusian parameter , in that case is @xmath161 , and leads to an exploding exponential that grows very fast in a short time .",
    "the poisson process is special , since @xmath162 depends linearly on @xmath8 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath8 for social networks influences the total reach of the cascades but also the time dynamics .",
    "however this is not always the case , as we will see for other time processes .",
    "besides , the poissonian case tells us that the time dynamics of viral cascades is markovian and that human dynamics can be described by differential equations like ( [ eqpoisson ] ) .    *",
    "gamma process : * in the case in which the distribution of response times is not given by an exponential , the behavior below the `` tipping - point '' is given by eq .",
    "( [ solmalthusian ] ) for distributions @xmath137 not in the sub - exponential class . above the `` tipping - point ''",
    "the malthusian parameter @xmath163 always exists , but the relationship with @xmath8 can be highly non - linear .",
    "for example , in many applications it is found that the response time distribution @xmath164 can be fitted to the cdf of the gamma distribution @xcite , whose pdf is @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite vzquez et al .  found that the email response time is distributed as ( [ pdfgamma ] ) with @xmath168 and @xmath169 days . on the other hand , the gamma distribution is used as simple model for the response time or lifetime since it can accommodate different functional behaviors : a delta function when @xmath170 and @xmath171 fixed , a power - law with exponential cutoff when @xmath172 , or the exponential case when @xmath173 . for @xmath174 and @xmath175 the gamma distribution does not belong to the sub - exponential class .",
    "thus the malthusian parameter always exists and moreover it can be calculated exactly as @xmath176    this equations shows the non - trivial entanglement in the time dynamics of the recommendation process between the distribution of recommendations ( @xmath8 ) and the response time distribution ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "in particular , it shows that the exponential growth depends not only on the mean response time @xmath178 but also on the variance . to show this",
    ", we take the case @xmath179 fixed and we vary @xmath180 to control the variance . figure [ figmalth ] shows that above the `` tipping - point '' @xmath162 diverges when @xmath181 grows and thus propagation happens much more rapidly than in the case of the poissonian approximation .",
    "the reason for it is that above the `` tipping - point '' the initial exponential growth of the infinite cascade is triggered by those people with response times below the mean , which in the case of long - tailed distributions are also more abundant than those with large response times .",
    "below the `` tipping - point '' , the contrary happens : since all cascades die out , their time dynamics is controlled by few nodes who , in the case of long - tailed distributions , can have large response times halting the branching process and slowing down the propagation of the information . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ maltgamma ] ) recovers the result in @xcite that with @xmath168 and _ below _ the `` tipping - point '' we get @xmath182 , i.e. the time scale is given by the cutoff in the distribution of response times .    however , it is important to note that even in this case , the asymptotic dynamics in the limit @xmath89 is still given by the exponential decay in equation ( [ solmalthusian ] ) which shows that although @xmath162 now depends non - trivially on the moments of the @xmath137 distribution we may describe the dynamics in terms of markovian equations like ( [ eqpoisson ] ) replacing @xmath162 by its actual value .      in the case where @xmath137 is sub - exponential",
    "the malthusian parameter does not exist below the `` tipping - point '' and the process asymptotic dynamics is given by the tail of the distribution @xmath137 as eq .",
    "( [ iasym ] ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that we can not describe the dynamics of viral cascades by markovian approximations like the differential equations eqs .",
    "( [ eqpoisson ] ) a sign for the strong non - markovian character of the process in this situation , which corresponds to our empirical findings",
    ".    * log - normal process : * we concentrate on the case where @xmath137 is the cdf of the log - normal distribution which we found to be a good model for the response time in our campaigns .",
    "specifically assuming its pdf is @xmath183 with mean @xmath58 and variance @xmath184 , then eq . ( [ iasym ] ) tells us that @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the complementary error function . in the large @xmath60 limit",
    "we can replace @xmath186 in eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) by the first term of its asymptotic expansion to obtain @xmath187 which indicates that the decay below the `` tipping - point '' is not exponential and also that it happens in a logarithmic and not in a linear time scale as shown in fig .",
    "this in turn implies that the information propagation prevails for much longer times than expected , as was shown in @xcite , since the asymptotic dynamics in dying viral cascades can be dominated ( and halted ) by a single individual .",
    "however , above the `` tipping - point '' the malthusian parameter @xmath162 always exists and can be calculated . in this case",
    "however , it can be very different from the poissonian approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ malthusianpoissonian ] ) since there is not an analytical solution in closed form for the laplace transform of the log - normal distribution and equation [ malthusian ] must be solved through numerical methods like the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "finally , an important difference with the super - exponential process is that with sub - exponential cdf s of the response times eq .",
    "( [ iasym ] ) shows an asymptotic dynamics for @xmath188 that is always universally given by the cdf of the response ( with a rescaling prefactor dependent on @xmath8 ) .",
    "this could be used to measure @xmath137 if no access to individual responses is possible .",
    "note however than in the case of sub - exponential distributions , this is not possible since the malthusian parameter in eq .",
    "( [ malthusian ] ) depends highly non - trivially on both @xmath137 and @xmath8 .",
    "we closely tracked an invariable message propagation in an information diffusion process below the `` tipping - point '' ( i.e. with @xmath189 ) driven by a real viral marketing mechanism run in several european markets .",
    "our analysis of the data set of the resulting propagation that reached over 31,000 individuals , reveals the striking diffusion patterns that characterize the dynamics of information diffusion processes as being substantially different from the ones used in the epidemic models traditionally used to explain information propagation .",
    "those characteristic patterns affect both the structure of the propagation paths and their dynamics . on the structural side ,",
    "the viral propagation cascades are nearly pure trees almost completely devoid of closed loops or cycles and feature a very low clustering coefficient which is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the one typical of the email social networks upon which the viral propagation took place . besides , the recommendations spreading activity of the campaigns active participants is very heterogeneous and its pdf is a long - tailed power - law which explains why most of the observed propagation was due to extraordinary events caused by _ super - spreading _ individuals . on the other hand",
    ", the dynamics side of the propagation process shows that a majority of the spreading individuals become inactive right after sending their recommendations in what could be considered a `` birth - and - death '' process . finally , the pdf of the forwarding time for the received recommendations is also a very heterogeneous long - tailed distribution , a log - normal in this case , and the spreaders forwarding time distribution and that of the number of recommendations they sent are independent and uncorrelated .    while there exist in the literature a number of studies about the static properties of viral information diffusion none of them explain the peculiar features discovered in the dynamics of our real campaigns . on the one hand",
    "most models concentrate only on the static asymptotic properties of the viral dynamics like jurvetson s viral marketing model @xcite , the marketing percolation model of goldenberg and libai @xcite , or the recommendation propagation model by leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite which predicts a power - law with exponent @xmath190 for the distribution of the number of recommendations .",
    "on the other hand , numerous authors have studied the dynamic stochastic rumors @xcite using the daley - kendall ( dk ) or the susceptible - infective - refractory ( sir ) propagation models with markovian differential equations , or the elaborate branching model of van der lans et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "however those models assume that the response time can be described by an exponential distribution which facilitates the theoretical analysis since markovian and thus viral information diffusion can be explained by differential equations .",
    "as we have found , this is not the case for our real experiments and we have described how to model the dynamics of information diffusion by means of the bellman - harris , which is the minimal framework to understand the non - markovian spreading of information on social networks .",
    "this model generalizes the branching galton - watson scheme typically used both in information diffusion @xcite and general percolation processes in social networks @xcite .",
    "our main result is that the information diffusion process object of this research shows a branching dynamics with some striking peculiarities that result a ) from the human characteristic patterns when scheduling and prioritizing tasks , b ) from the human decisions on how to select targets for the viral propagation , and , c ) from the negligible influence of the substrate social network when the process runs below the  ` tipping - point'. thus , to explain all of them we propose a concise model that considers the large heterogeneity of human behavior but neglects the impact of the email social network underlying the diffusion process .",
    "the mathematical description of this approach is a non - markovian , bellman - harris branching model with a sub - exponential ( log - normal ) distribution of the recommendations response time @xmath137 like the one in section [ subexp ] , and two different power - law distributions for the number of referrals for the classes of _ seed _ and _ viral _ nodes , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "since @xmath31 and @xmath191 in our model are both iid random variables , the overall _ a priori _ probability of transmission of the information between two individuals , the _ transmissibility _ @xmath2 , is the average over the distributions @xmath17 and @xmath56 of the transmission probability between any two individuals @xcite .",
    "thus , per newman @xcite , our branching model is equivalent to uniform bond percolation on the same social network and several magnitudes of interest ( cascades size distribution and `` tipping - point '' ) in the infinite time limit can be obtained by mapping it onto a bond percolation model .",
    "given the distributions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath192 and @xmath56 , this model accurately predicts all the magnitudes of interest of the viral information or wom diffusion processes : the dynamic parameters _ transmissibility _ and _ fanout coefficient _ , the cascades size distribution , its average and variance in the asymptotic limit , the _ cascades network _ clustering coefficient , the message propagation `` tipping - point '' or the precise time dynamics in the asymptotic regime .",
    "besides , it allows predictions for processes past , but close to , the `` tipping - point '' provided the substrate network of the propagation is large enough to avoid finite - size effects and maintain the assumption of its negligible influence .",
    "the accuracy of those predictions , which can be achieved early in the propagation process , make this model a valuable tool for managing information diffusion . finally since most information transmission , sharing and searching in social networks has limited reach ( thus happening below the `` tipping - point '' ) and given the fact that there seems to exists certain universality on both the heterogeneity in the number of actions @xcite and the sub - exponential character of human response times @xcite , our theoretical model is thus the most basic and general analytical tool to understand processes like rumor spreading , cooperation , opinion formation , cultural dynamics , diffusion of innovations , etc .",
    "assuming independence between the degree of a social network node and the number of messages it sends in a diffusion process , the undirected clustering coefficients of the social network @xmath193 and of the _ cascades network _",
    "@xmath194 are correlated .",
    "both are defined as @xcite @xmath195 where `` triple '' means a node with two edges running to an unordered pair of others .",
    "if connected , such pair forms a triangle . in a mean - field approximation",
    "they can be estimated as @xmath196 with @xmath197 and @xmath198 being the average of triangles or triples by node in the social ( _ soc _ ) or cascades ( _ cas _ ) network .",
    "the probability of finding a triangle on a given node is the probability of it having a triple times the linking probability of its end nodes @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the existence probability of a link in the open side of the triad . due to the independence of social links and recommendations , the average number of triangles and triples in the _ cascades network _ results @xmath201 which replaced in [ a2 ] , [ a3 ] and combined with [ a4 ] yield @xmath202    since nodes reached by a viral message become active with probability @xmath203 and each resends it in average to @xmath1 of its @xmath204 nearest neighbors ( excluding the ancestor node ) , the probability of closing the triple is @xmath205 whose factor 2 stems from the fact that either of the nodes at the open end of a triple can send the message and close the triangle .",
    "replacing @xmath200 in [ a7 ] recovers eq .",
    "( [ eq : cvir ] ) which has been verified ( even for @xmath206 ) through simulations on a university email network @xcite with @xmath207 .",
    "its correlation with the _ cascades network _ clustering coefficient as a function of @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figclust ] .",
    "the low values of @xmath194 explain why our model neglects the substrate network structure in the study of information propagation below the `` tipping - point '' .",
