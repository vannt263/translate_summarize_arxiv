    "the evidence is circumstantial : there is spectroscopic evidence for a ` hot companion ' in the blue , in the form of h ( and other ) emission lines .",

    "although a b0v classification is assigned to the hot component , the presence of a massive ( @xmath10 ) star in the  system seems unlikely on kinematic grounds . for a distance of @xmath11  kpc @xcite it lies @xmath12  pc above the galactic plane and",
    "its proper motion @xcite takes it towards the plane ",
    "highly unlikely for a b0v star .    furthermore , the spectral energy distribution ( sed )  from 4400  to 100   can be fit ( bearing in mind the variability ) by a two component dusty @xcite model .",
    "the hot component is a b _ subdwarf _ at the centre of a dust shell having 0.01  amorphous carbon grains with a temperature of 800  k at the inner boundary and an optical depth of @xmath13 in the visual .",
    "the cool component is a m7iii star that effectively plays no part in heating the dust ( see fig .  [ sed ] ) .",
    "the dusty fit assumes that the dust shell is spherically symmetric with the b  star located at its centre , so clearly the fit has its limitations ( e.g. a disc is more likely in a binary ) .",

    "the size of the strmgren sphere associated with the b  star exceeds this if the gas density in its vicinity @xmath15  m@xmath16 .",
    "the reclassification of the hot component as a subdwarf removes the need for the large reddening assigned by @xcite and others , and is consistent with an interstellar reddening @xmath17  mag @xcite .",
    "it also has implications for the nature and evolution of the binary .",
    "although the cool component in  seems to be oxygen - rich  as evidenced by the presence of tio and vo bands  the 8.6  and 11.2  uir features reported in the ir spectrum of  by @xcite are typical of carbon - rich environments .",

    "the uir feature at 6.25  is detected and the non - detection of the 3.28  and 3.4  uir features is confirmed . the ` 8 ' feature reported by @xcite is the long wavelength wing of the well - known ` 7.7 ' feature , affected by inadequate cancellation of the atmosphere near the edge of the @xmath18  window .    in most stars the flux in the 3.28  uir feature is typically comparable to that of the ` 7.7 ' feature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . on this basis we would expect the 3.28  feature in  to have a peak flux @xmath19jy . while there is indeed evidence for a feature at @xmath20  ( see fig .",
    "[ iso - sws ] ) , the spectrum in this region is dominated by molecular absorption ( e.g. co , oh ) in the m  giant , which has a flux of @xmath21jy at 3 . the apparent absence of the 3.28  feature can presumably be attributed to the fact that it is swamped by the emission from the m  star .",

    "the changes we see in the strengths and possibly central wavelengths of the uir features may be associated with changes in the ionisation of the pah ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "features at these wavelengths are included in the pahfit package @xcite but we consider it unlikely that the two features in  are due to emission by pah molecules , for the following reasons : ( a )  their absence in 2005 , when other uir features were present ; ( b )  the strength of the 19  feature compared with that of the 17.4 ; ( c )  the 17.4/7.7  flux ratio .",
    "the 17.4  feature was reported in ngc7023 by @xcite , who assigned it to `` aromatic hydrocarbons or nanoparticles of unknown mineralogy '' ; it has subsequently been attributed to c@xmath0 @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fluxes ]    the `` 17.4 '' feature we observe in  is actually at 17.25 , quite different from the expected value of 17.53  for gas phase c@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , _ solid _",
    "c@xmath0 has a feature at 17.3@xcite , closer to the 17.25  feature in",
    ". we should therefore consider whether the features in fig .",
    "[ c60 ] arise in gaseous or solid c@xmath0 .",
    "the flux ratios of the putative c@xmath0 features enable an estimate of the vibrational temperature @xmath34 if the c@xmath0 is in gaseous form . using einstein coefficients from @xcite ( 1995 ; included in table  [ fluxes ] ) , values of @xmath35  k",
    "are obtained ; however the `` 18.9 '' flux seems underestimated by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "a similar value ( @xmath36  k ) is obtained assuming that the energy of a @xmath37  ev photon absorbed by a c@xmath0 molecule is equally distributed amongst the available vibrational modes . however , at this temperature the `` 8.5 '' feature would have a flux @xmath38  w  m@xmath26 , far greater than observed .",
    "we also note that laboratory measurements on solid c@xmath0 @xcite suggest that the `` 8.5 '' feature is rather weaker than the other three .",
    "therefore on the basis of ( i )  the wavelength of the `` 17.4 '' feature and ( ii )  the weakness of the `` 8.5 '' feature , we conclude that the c@xmath0 in  is most likely in solid form ; if so this is the first astrophysical detection of solid c@xmath0 .",
    "the absorption cross - section of c@xmath0 has been measured by @xcite , from which we estimate the planck mean absorption cross - section per c@xmath0 molecule ( averaged over the emission of the b  star ) to be @xmath39  m@xmath40 . if ( cf .",
    "section  [ binary ] ) the b  star is situated at @xmath14  m from the inner boundary of the dust shell , the temperature of a c@xmath0 grain of radius @xmath41 is @xmath42  k.    while the apparent absence of c@xmath0 in the irs spectrum immediately after eclipse in 2005 , and its presence in 2007 , is suggestive , it is difficult to argue that the eclipse is in any way connected with the presence of c@xmath0 in the spectrum , especially as it is the giant that is eclipsed : it is likely therefore that the appearance of c@xmath0 in 2007 is unconnected with the eclipse of fig .",
    "we can make an estimate of the mass of c@xmath0 using the combined flux in the c@xmath0 features . assuming ( cf .",
    "section  [ binary ] ) the b  star is situated at @xmath14  m from the inner boundary of the dust shell , and using the",
    "planck mean absorption cross - section above , the absorbed power per c@xmath0 particle is @xmath43  w. the emitted power ( assuming a distance of 2  kpc for ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath44  w , so @xmath45 c@xmath0 particles ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , in solid form , are required .",
    "this suggests that the number of c@xmath0 molecules is @xmath47 the number of pah molecules .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0 in a range of environments @xcite , including both h - poor and h - rich environments , indicates that c@xmath0 can form in a variety of astrophysical conditions .",
    "@xcite suggest that both the uir carrier and c@xmath0 may form as a result of the disintegration of hydrogenous amorphous carbon ( hac ) grains .",
    "however the fact that hac is seen in environments ( e.g. novae ; cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which c@xmath0 is _ not _ seen indicates that there are other factors that determine whether or not c@xmath0 is detected .",
    "most of the objects in which c@xmath0 has been reported are associated with stars having effective temperature @xmath48 in the range @xmath49k , the exception being the rcb star v854  cen ( @xmath50k ) .",
    "is in the former category , while classical novae have t@xmath51k at the time of dust formation .",
    "notwithstanding the small number of objects in which c@xmath0 has been detected , the data thus far may point to the fact that it is the effective temperature of the central star that is the common factor in the detection of c@xmath0 , the critical range being @xmath52k .    in 2007",
    "the c@xmath0 in  seems to be present when the ir h recombination lines are weak , and the 8.5  and 11.2  uir features are strong .",
    "this suggests either ( a )   that the c@xmath0 is not a permanent feature of the environment but is formed when conditions are favourable ( either by fragmentation of larger particles , or by chemical routes from smaller molecules ) , or ( b )  that c@xmath0 is a permanent feature and that its excitation is intermittent .",
    "one possible scenario is that the c@xmath0-bearing material is , as already discussed , confined to the vicinity of the b star .",
    "the h lines arise from a shell , also associated with the b star and possibly accreted from the giant wind ; the relative sizes of the ionised and dusty regions depend on the gas density .",
    "the formation of c - rich dust would require the photodissociation of wind co by uv radiation from the b star to release c for carbon chemistry @xcite .",
    "enhanced formation of c@xmath0 ( coincidentally after the 2005 eclipse ) would be consistent with the appearance of c@xmath0 in 2007 .",
    "quenching of the uv radiation from the b star by the c@xmath0-containing dust would lead to reduced excitation of h in the shell .",
    "if this is correct then it is likely that c@xmath0 is formed `` bottom up '' rather than `` top down '' .",

    "contrary to previous work we conclude that the hot star is a b subdwarf that is surrounded by an ionised shell and a c@xmath0-bearing shell , most likely in the form of a disc .",
