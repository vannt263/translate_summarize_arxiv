    "although a scalar field theory is often used only as a first approximation towards a more precise description of a physical system , it can nevertheless reveal significant properties of the system . among many features of scalar field theories that have been extensively studied ,",
    "those describing special kinds of solutions  solitons , instantons and bounces  are particularly interesting .",
    "bounces , for example , are related to stability properties of classical and quantum configurations in such theories .",
    "this relation exists because a stable classical state may be only metastable quantum - mechanically .",
    "the instability is realized by allowing a metastable state to tunnel to a stable state via a quantum barrier penetration or to thermally climb over the barrier in order to arrive at the stable state .",
    "these processes are widely used in describing various physical systems ranging from phase transitions in solids to bubble formation in cosmological inflaton fields  @xcite .    due to its prevalence in theoretical models , the tunneling in scalar field theories should be thoroughly understood and accurate approximation methods for its equations should be developed . toward the latter goal ,",
    "we specifically focus on approximation methods for the bounce in euclidean field theories .",
    "the bounce itself and the first approximation for it ( called the thin - wall approximation ) was introduced by coleman  @xcite .",
    "callan and coleman  @xcite developed the first quantum corrections for the bounce .",
    "coleman , glaser and martin  @xcite proved that , for a wide class of potentials , spherically - symmetric solutions to equations of motion are the solutions with the lowest action .",
    "coleman and de luccia  @xcite considered modification to the thin - wall approximation due to gravitational effects and showed that increasing the effects of gravity can render the false vacuum stable . since these seminal works on the bounce , significant progress has been made in improving accuracy and generality of the thin - wall approximation , for example , for a restricted class of polynomial potentials  @xcite and non - polynomial potentials  @xcite .",
    "quantum corrections for the bounce were also enhanced and the decay rate of the false vacuum was obtained , for example , in the one loop effective action calculations  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "further studies showed intricate properties of gravitational bounces , @xcite , @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a new method of approximate solutions for the multidimensional spherical bounce .",
    "the method starts with the thin - wall approximation as its first step and proceeds to higher orders iteratively with fast convergence and high accuracy .",
    "analysis of the problem from a new perspective demonstrates some universal properties of the bounce .",
    "the method is not restricted to only certain types of potentials or dimensions of space , and we demonstrate its computational power with the general fourth - order polynomial potential .",
