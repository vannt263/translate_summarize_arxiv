    "big bang nucleosynthesis is entering the precision era @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "there has been major progress in the observational determination of the abundances of the light elements d @xcite , @xmath0he @xcite , @xmath1he @xcite , and @xmath2li@xcite , although the increasing precision has highlighted discrepancies between different measurements ( see refs.@xcite for recent assessments ) .",
    "secondly , we have a sound analytical understanding of the physical processes involved @xcite and the standard bbn computer code @xcite which incorporates this physics is robust and can be easily altered to accomodate changes in the input parameters , e.g.  nuclear reaction rates @xcite .",
    "the comparison of increasingly accurate observationally inferred and theoretical abundances will further constrain the values of fundamental parameters , such as the nucleon density parameter ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) or extra degrees of freedom related to possible new physics beyond the standard model ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it goes without saying that error evaluation represents an essential part of such comparisons .    because of the complex interplay between different nuclear reactions , it is not straightforward to assess the effect on a particular elemental yield of the uncertainties in the experimentally determined reaction rates .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite first employed monte carlo methods to sample the error distributions of the relevant reaction cross - sections which were then used as inputs to the standard bbn computer code .",
    "this enables well - defined confidence levels to be attached to the theoretically predicted abundances , e.g. the abundance range within which say 95% of the computed values fall correspond to 95% c.l .",
    "limits on the expected abundance .",
    "it was later realized that error correlations are also relevant , and can be estimated with the same technique @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) approach has since become the standard tool for comparing theory and data @xcite .",
    "however , although it can include refinements such as asymmetric or temperature - dependent reaction rate uncertainties @xcite , it requires lengthy calculations which need to be repeated each time ( any of ) the input parameters are changed or updated . since we may expect continued improvement in the determination of the relevant parameters , it is desirable to have a faster method for error evaluation and comparison with observations .    in this work",
    "we propose a simple method for estimation of the bbn abundance uncertainties and their correlations which requires little computational effort .",
    "the method , based on linear error propagation , is described in sec .",
    "a concrete application is given in sec .",

    "conclusions and perspectives for further work are presented in sec .",
    "the four relevant element abundances @xmath4 considered in this work are defined in table  i. ( note that the abundance of @xmath1he is conventionally quoted as a _ mass fraction _ , while the abundances of d , @xmath0he and @xmath2li are ratios by number . ) in bbn calculations , the @xmath4 s depend both on model parameters ( the nucleon - to - photon ratio @xmath5 , the number of neutrino families @xmath6 , etc . ) and on a network of nuclear reactions @xmath7 : @xmath8 the most important @xmath7 s are listed , numbered as in ref.@xcite , in the first two columns of table  ii , while our default inputs for the rates @xmath7 and their @xmath9 uncertainties @xmath10 are given in the third and fourth columns .",
    "the numerical values are given in ratio to the reference reaction rates compiled in table  1 of ref.@xcite ; we have chosen identical values ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) except for @xmath12 , the neutron decay rate , where we adopt the most recent world average for the neutron lifetime of @xmath13  s @xcite , as compared to the value of @xmath14  s used in ref.@xcite .",

    "we will comment on this point at the end of this section . ]      for simplicity we consider only the standard bbn case ( i.e. , @xmath19 , etc . ) , so that @xmath5 is the only model parameter being varied in the calculation of the abundances @xmath4 and of their uncertainties @xmath20 : @xmath21 our method can however be easily generalized to nonstandard cases .    for a relatively small change @xmath22 of the input rate",

    "( [ dyi ] ) are correlated , since they all originate from the same set of reaction rate shifts @xmath30 .",
    "the global information is contained in the error matrix ( also called covariance matrix ) @xcite , which is a generalization of the `` error vector '' @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ dyi ] ) .",
    "in particular , the abundance error matrix @xmath31 obtained by linearly propagating the input @xmath32 reaction rate uncertainties @xmath10 to the output abundances @xmath4 reads : @xmath33 this matrix completely defines the abundance uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 abundance errors @xmath20 of eq .",

    "( [ sigmaij],[sigmaii ] ) through the standard definition @xmath36 thus eqs.([yi][rhoij ] ) represent all that is required to calculate the errors in the predicted abundances and their correlations .",
    "note that the relevant physics is contained entirely in the central values @xmath4 and in their logarithmic derivatives @xmath37 , which have to be evaluated just once with a bbn numerical code , thus dramatically reducing the required computing time.r_k   /2y_i(\\eta,\\,r_k)\\delta\\,r_k$ ] , at given @xmath5 .",
    "we find negligible difference between left and right derivatives .",
    "] we have made a further check of the linearity of the error propagation by calculating the logarithmic derivatives with increments equal to @xmath38 ( default ) and @xmath39 , obtaining practically the same functions @xmath37 in either case .",
    "this means that doubling the error on @xmath7 also doubles the corresponding error component of @xmath4 , i.e. the error propagation is indeed linear .",
    "we think it useful to present the results of this exercise in the form of tables so all calculations that will now follow can be done on a pocket calculator . tables  iii and iv show the coefficients of polynomial fits to @xmath4 and @xmath37 , respectively , for @xmath5 in the usually considered range @xmath40 .",

    "we have used the bbn code @xcite with the lowest possible settings of the time steps in the ( 2nd order ) runge - kutta routine , which allows rapid convergence to within @xmath41 of the true value @xcite .",
    "we understand that our results are in good agreement with a recent independent computation of @xmath42 using a new bbn computer code @xcite . ]",
    "the abundances @xmath43 with their associated @xmath44 standard deviation error bands calculated through eq .",
    "( [ sigmaii ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "the functions @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; note that some of these vary strongly ( and even change sign ) with @xmath5 , indicating that the physical dependence of the @xmath4 s on the @xmath7 s may be quite subtle . although some general features of this dependence have been addressed in ref.@xcite , further work is needed to interpret the functional form of the @xmath37 s in fig .",
    "we intend to address this issue elsewhere . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the fractional uncertainties @xmath45 and their correlations @xmath35 as derived from eqs .",
    "( [ sigmaij][rhoij ] ) .",
    "notice that , in general , the error correlations are non - negligible and should be properly taken into account in statistical analyses , as first emphasized in ref.@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the recipe for evaluating the bbn uncertainties @xmath46 affecting the @xmath4 s for a given value of @xmath5 is :    ( @xmath25 ) : :    determine the abundances @xmath43 and their logarithmic    derivatives @xmath28 using tables iii and iv ,    respectively ;  ( @xmath47 ) : :    if the central values of the reaction rates @xmath7 are    updated @xmath23 with respect to those    reported in table  ii , then update also the central values of the    abundances @xmath48 through    eq .",
    "( [ dyi ] ) ; ( @xmath49 ) : :    for given reaction rate uncertainties @xmath50 ( e.g. ,    from table  iii ) , compute the abundance errors @xmath20    and their correlations @xmath35 using    eqs .",
    "( [ sigmaij][rhoij ] ) .",
    "our approach is based on the linear propagation of errors originating from many independent sources ( i.e. the @xmath7 s ) .",
    "one can expect that this method will work reasonably well , both because the input fractional uncertainties @xmath51 are relatively small , and because the final output uncertainties @xmath20 affecting the abundances @xmath4 are `` regularized '' by the central limit theorem .",
    "indeed , our @xmath52 bands in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] compare well with the mc - estimated bands of refs .",
    "@xcite , with small relative differences which depend , in part on different input @xmath53 s , and that are not larger than the spread among the various mc estimates themselves .",
    "in order to be more quantitative , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( upper panel ) the mc evaluation of the fractional uncertainties @xmath45 as derived from ref.@xcite have been read off the ( small ) panels of fig .  27 in ref.@xcite and ,",
    "therefore , may be subject to small transcription errors . ] with our analytic estimate ( using , for this exercise , the same input parameters ) .",
    "there is good agreement between these two totally independent estimates . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( lower panel ) we also show a comparison with the only mc evaluation of @xmath35 we are aware of ( viz .",
    ", ref.@xcite ) , obtaining again good agreement with our calculation when the same input @xmath54 are used .",
    "we conclude the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by noting that the uncertainty @xmath55 and the correlations @xmath56 related to the often - used combination of abundances @xmath57 are given , within our approach , by : @xmath58 there are , of course , some refined features of the mc approach that can not be addressed with our method , such as asymmetric or temperature - dependent uncertainties @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "however we consider these refinements not essential for practical applications . in a sense ,",
    "the possible asymmetry between `` upper '' and `` lower '' errors is where one wants it to be .",
    "for instance , if one assumes _ a priori _ symmetric errors in the astrophysical @xmath59-factors , then asymmetric errors are induced in the thermally averaged reaction rates @xmath60 ; conversely , the requirement of _ a priori _ symmetric @xmath50 errors requires that the input @xmath59-factor uncertainties are readjusted , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the authors of ref.@xcite have adopted the latter option @xmath61 , the former option or others are equally acceptable , and would clearly produce different outputs for the mc estimate of the abundance errors .",
    "for instance , the upper and lower errors of @xmath62 appear to be rather symmetrical in the mc calculation of ref.@xcite , while they are noticeably asymmetrical in ref.@xcite .",
    "concerning the temperature - dependent @xcite uncertainties @xmath63 and @xmath18 , which affect mainly the estimate of @xmath62 , our conservative choice in table  ii proves to be successful for the estimate of @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the uncertainties at low temperatures ( which are larger than those at high temperatures @xcite ) dominate in the estimate of these errors . in any case , since practically all reaction rate uncertainties @xmath50 contribute to the final value of @xmath65 , temperature - dependent refinements in the propagation of just two of these ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) do not appear to be decisive for the estimate of the global error @xmath65 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown that our simple analytic method for error evaluation represents an useful alternative to lengthy and computationally expensive mc simulations .",
    "both the magnitude and the correlations of the total errors affecting the theoretical abundances are reproduced with good accuracy .",
    "we therefore advocate the use of this method for bbn analyses as an alternative to mc simulations .",
    "the comparison of the predicted primordial abundances @xmath66 with their observationally inferred values @xmath67 through a statistical test allows extraction of the likelihood range for the fundamental parameter @xmath5 .",
    "so far , this has been done either through fit - by - eye ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) or by monte carlo - based maximum likelihood methods ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . in this section",
    "we show how limits on @xmath5 can be simply extracted using @xmath3 statistics based on the method described in the previous section .    assuming that the errors @xmath68 in the determinations of different abundances @xmath69 are uncorrelated , the experimental squared error matrix @xmath70 is simply @xmath71 where @xmath72 is kronecker s delta .",
    "the total ( experimental + theoretical ) error matrix @xmath73 is then obtained by summing the matrices in eqs .",
    "( [ sigmaij],[sigmaijexp ] ) : @xmath74 its inverse defines the weight matrix @xmath75 : @xmath76^{-1}. \\label{w}\\ ] ] the @xmath3 statistic associated with the difference between theoretical @xmath77 and observational @xmath78 light element abundance determinations is then @xcite : @xmath79\\cdot w_{ij}(\\eta)\\cdot [ y_j(\\eta)-\\overline{y_j}]\\ . \\label{chi}\\ ] ] minimization of the @xmath3 gives the most probable value of @xmath5 , while the intervals defined by @xmath80 give the likely ranges of @xmath5 at the confidence level set by @xmath81 ( for one degree of freedom , @xmath5 ) . and 6.64 correspond to confidence levels ( c.l.s ) of @xmath82 and 99% , respectively .",
    "] in order to illustrate this , we estimate @xmath5 using recent observational data for the three light element abundances ( @xmath83 whose primordial origin is most secure .",
    "it is well known that the observationally inferred values @xmath84 and @xmath85 are still controversial , and the conflict between different determinations has driven a lively debate on the status of bbn ( see refs.@xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we do not enter into this debate but rather apply our method to two possible ( although mutually incompatible ) selections of measurements which we name data set `` a '' and data set `` b '' : @xmath86 @xmath87 the data set `` a '' is used in ref.@xcite , the authors of which make a detailed mc - based fit to @xmath5 , thus enabling comparison with our method .",
    "note that their adopted value of the primordial deuterium abundance from observations of high redshift quasar absorption systems is consistent with another recent observation , @xmath88 @xcite , but in conflict with the significantly smaller value reported in ref.@xcite , which we adopt for data set `` b '' .",
    "similarly the primordial helium mass fraction inferred from observations of metal - poor blue compact galaxies which we adopt for data set `` b '' is from ref.@xcite in which it is argued that previous analyses leading to the smaller value of @xmath84 used in data set `` a '' underestimate the true abundance ( although this is disputed in ref.@xcite . )",
    "finally the estimates for the primordial lithium abundance in both data sets are based on observations of pop  ii stars , with the slightly higher value @xcite of @xmath89 in data set `` b '' taken from an updated analysis .",
    "readers who prefer to adopt different combinations of these , or indeed other , estimates for the primordial abundances are invited to perform their own fit to @xmath5 by following the simple prescription given here .    before performing the @xmath3 fit , it is useful to get an idea of what one should expect by comparing the data with the theoretical predictions at various values of @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the theoretical predictions for the abundances @xmath90 , @xmath42 , and @xmath62 in the three possible planes @xmath91 , for representative values of @xmath92 . the corresponding @xmath9 error ellipses show clearly the size and the correlation of the `` theoretical '' errors .",
    "the observational data sets `` a '' and `` b '' are also indicated on the figure , as crosses with @xmath9 error bars .",
    "clearly the former prefers @xmath93 while the latter favours @xmath94(45)@xmath95 .",
    "a more precise estimate of the likely range of @xmath5 is obtained , as anticipated , through a @xmath3 fit .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath96 is almost zero for the fit to data set `` a '' , indicating very good agreement between theory and observations , while it is somewhat larger for data set `` b '' .",
    "note that the characteristic minimum in the @xmath2li curve at @xmath97 ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) allows its measured abundance to be compatible with both high d / low @xmath1he ( data set `` a '' ) or low d / high @xmath1he ( data set `` b '' ) .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "ranges allowed by each of the two data sets , as obtained by cutting the curves at @xmath98 , are : @xmath99 the range for case `` a '' agrees very well with the 95% c.l .  range estimated in ref.@xcite with the same inputs but with a different method ( monte carlo + maximum likelihood ) .",
    "of course , the incompatibility between the above two ranges of @xmath5 reflects the incompatibility between the input abundance data within their stated errors .",
    "the role of the different nuclear reactions rates listed in table  ii in the synthesis of the light elements can be studied by `` perturbing '' the values of the input reaction rates and observing their effect on the predicted abundances .",
    "more precisely , one can study the contribution to the total uncertainty @xmath20 of @xmath4 induced by a @xmath100 shift of @xmath7 : @xmath101 within our approach , this can be done very easily using eq .",
    "( 3 ) , with the @xmath50 s from table  ii .",
    "of course , the results depend on the value chosen for @xmath5 . to illustrate various trends , we choose the best - fit values @xmath102 and @xmath103 , corresponding to data sets `` a '' and `` b '' respectively",

    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show the deviations @xmath24 ( normalized to the total error @xmath20 ) induced by @xmath100 shifts in the @xmath7 s , plotted in the same set of planes as used for fig .",
    "the @xmath9 error ellipses shown in these figures are obtained by combining the deviation vectors @xmath104 in an uncorrelated manner .",
    "several interesting conclusions can be drawn from this exercise . as expected , the uncertainty in the weak interaction rate @xmath12 has the greatest impact on @xmath42 for the high value of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , since essentially all neutrons end up being bound in @xmath1he .",
    "however at the lower value of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , the uncertainty in @xmath105  the `` deuterium bottleneck ''  plays an equally important role as @xmath12 in determining @xmath42 because nuclear burning is less complete here than at high @xmath5 . similarly with reference to the reaction rates",
    "@xmath106 , @xmath107 which synthesize @xmath2li , at low @xmath5 it is the competition between @xmath106 and @xmath108 which largely determines @xmath62 , while at high @xmath5 it is the competition between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the anticorrelation between @xmath42 and @xmath90 is driven mainly by @xmath105 at low @xmath5 and , to a lesser extent , by @xmath111 and @xmath112 , while the reverse is the case at high @xmath5 .",
    "the anticorrelation between @xmath42 and @xmath62 at low @xmath5 is also basically driven by @xmath105 , while the correlation at high @xmath5 is due to both @xmath105 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus we have a direct visual basis for assessing in what direction the output abundances @xmath4 are pulled by possible changes in the input cross sections @xmath7 .",
    "we have shown that a simple method based on linear error propagation allows us to quantify the uncertainties associated with the elemental abundances expected from big bang nucleosynthesis , in excellent agreement with the results obtained from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this method makes transparent which nuclear reaction rate is mainly responsible for the uncertainty in the abundance of a given element . if determinations of the primordial abundances improve to the point where the observational errors become smaller than the theoretical uncertainties ( say for @xmath2li ) , this will enable attention to be focussed on the particular reaction rate whose value needs to be experimentally better known .",
    "we have also demonstrated that for standard bbn , our method enables the use of simple @xmath3 statistics to obtain the best - fit value of @xmath5 from the comparison of theory and observations . at present",
    "there are conflicting claims regarding the primordial abundances of , particularly , d and @xmath1he , and different choices of input data sets imply values of @xmath5 differing by a factor of @xmath113 .",
    "however this quantity can also be determined through measurements of the angular anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on small angular scales . within a decade",
    "the forthcoming all - sky surveyors map and planck are expected to pinpoint the nucleon density to within @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "such measurements probe the acoustic oscillations of the coupled photon - matter plasma at the ( re)combination epoch and will thus provide an independent check of bbn , assuming @xmath5 did not change significantly between the two epochs .",
    ", e.g. by increasing the photon number through massive particle decay @xcite or , more exotically , by _ decreasing _ the photon number through photon mixing with a shadow sector @xcite .",
    "however such possibilities are strongly constrained by the absence of distortions in the planck spectrum of the cmb @xcite and also , in the latter case , by the absence of sakharov oscillations in the power spectrum of large - scale structure @xcite . ] nevertheless precise measurements of light element abundances , particularly @xmath1he , are still crucial because they provide a unique probe of physical conditions , in particular the expansion rate at the bbn epoch . to illustrate , if @xmath5 was determined by the cmb measurements to be @xmath115 ( consistent with data set `` a '' ) , but the abundance of @xmath1he was established to be actually closer to its higher value of @xmath116 in data set `` b ''",
    ", this would be a strong indication that the expansion rate during bbn was higher than in the standard case with @xmath19 neutrinos .",
    "although the number of @xmath117 doublet neutrinos is indeed 3 , there are many light particles expected in extensions of the standard model , e.g. singlet neutrinos , which can speed up the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the generalization of our method to such non - standard cases is straightforward and we intend to present these results in a future publication @xcite .",
