    "blazars are a subcategory of active galactic nuclei that can be divided into two general classes , namely bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "they are typically characterized by their rapid variability , superluminal motion and their extreme luminosities , often dominated by their @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "these features are considered to be the result of beamed emission from a relativistic jet oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars can be typically characterized by two broadband , nonthermal peaks that span from the radio to uv wavelengths and from x - rays to high energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "it is generally accepted that the first spectral component from radio to uv wavelengths is the result of synchrotron radiation of electrons / positrons in a magnetic field .",
    "for the origin of the second broadband peak , two different paradigms are often invoked , collectively referred to as leptonic and hadronic models @xcite . in the leptonic scenario , the high - energy ( x - ray ",
    "@xmath1-ray ) emission is due to inverse compton scattering of low - energy photons off the same electrons / positrons",
    ". the low - energy target photon fields can be the synchrotron photons within the emission region ( ssc = synchrotron self compton ) , or external photons ( ec = external compton ) , which can include the accretion disk @xcite , the broad line region ( blr ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or infra - red emitting , warm dust @xcite .",
    "leptonic models have been quite successful in explaining many features in the seds and light curves of blazars .",
    "hadronic models have also had success in modeling of blazar emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hadronic model suggests that the high - energy emission originates from the synchrotron emission from a ultrarelativistic protons .",
    "the relativistic protons interact with the radiation fields within the emission region , producing high energy pions , which then decay to produce muons , electrons , positrons , and neutrinos .",
    "the pions and their decay products emit their own radiation ( primarily synchrotron ) which adds to the broadband spectral components in the seds of blazars @xcite .    as shown in @xcite , leptonic and hadronic models",
    "are generally successful in reproducing the seds of many @xmath1-ray blazars .",
    "therefore , one needs additional diagnostics to distinguish which type of model is most applicable to blazars .",
    "the most obvious difference is the production of tev  pev neutrinos produced only in hadronic models .",
    "additionally , due to the vastly different acceleration and cooling time scales expected for electrons / positrons vs. protons , one also expects substantially different variability patterns predicted by the two types of models .",
    "this latter aspect is being studied in detail in this paper .",
    "note that an alternative discriminant may be the polarization of the high - energy ( x - ray ",
    "@xmath1-ray ) emission of blazars , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "determining the underlying shapes of the particle distributions that give rise to the broadband spectral components , is critical to understanding the physics of particle acceleration and cooling in agn jets .",
    "simple power law and broken power law proton distributions can be produced through diffusive shock acceleration when incorporating radiative losses , and such distributions have been invoked in hadronic models to explain the emission and subsequent particle cascades that produce high energy @xmath1-rays in blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second order fermi acceleration is a viable mechanism for producing log - parabola - shaped , curved spectra .",
    "the curvature of the spectra can give clues to the parameters governing the fermi ii acceleration mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , a time dependent hadronic model that considered a fokker - planck equation with the incorporation of radiative losses , second order fermi acceleration and the emission produced from the final decay products of the photo - hadronic interactions was utilized to explain blazar emission @xcite .",
    "the production rates of final decay products were derived by analytical parametrizations of the energy distributions for the neutrino , electron / positron and photon distributions from the interactions of relativistic protons with the photon fields , @xcite . however , in order for this approach to be viable , the synchrotron cooling time scales of the intermediate decay products ( pions and muons ) must be significantly longer than their decay time scale ( in the co - moving frame of the emission region ) , which restricts the combination of maximum proton lorentz factor , @xmath2 , and magnetic field @xmath3 to @xmath4  g @xcite .",
    "if blazar jets are the sites of the acceleration of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( @xmath5  ev ) , then such models are only applicable in the range of magnetic fields of @xmath6  g , substantially lower than usually found in hadronic modeling of blazars . for higher magnetic fields or maximum proton energies , the synchrotron emission from muons and possibly also charged pions becomes non - negligible . at the time of writing ,",
    "no time - dependent hadronic model has been published which incorporates the radiation emitted by the pions and muons produced in photo - hadronic interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a new , time dependent hadronic model that considers the radiation emitted by all secondary products and incorporates fermi acceleration and self - consistent radiative losses for all particle species ( including photo - pion production losses for protons ) .",
    "we use this new code to provide a fit to the average sed of the fsrq 3c 279 to determine a baseline parameter set .",
    "we then apply a gaussian perturbation to several input parameters ( specifically , the magnetic field , the proton injection luminosity , the fermi - ii acceleration time scale , and the proton injection spectral index ) in order to study the resulting light curves in the optical , x - rays , he and vhe @xmath1-rays as well as neutrinos in the energy range of sensitivity of icecube , and study the characteristic variability patterns and cross - correlations between the lightcurves in the various bandpasses .",
    "we describe the model setup in  [ theory ] ; we present a model fit to the sed of the blazar 3c 279 , using an equilibrium solution of our code , in  [ spectrum ] ; we then study the light curves resulting from the gaussian perturbation of the selected parameters in  [ lightcurve ] , and compute the cross - correlation functions between the various light curves , in  [ correlation ] ; we present a summary and brief discussion in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the assumptions made in our model , the features of the fokker - planck equations used for the evolution of each particle distribution , and the radiative components that they produce .",
    "we assume a homogenous , one zone model , where a population of ultra - relativistic protons is continuously injected into a spherical region of size @xmath7 , moving along the jet with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath8 , embedded in a homogeneous , randomly oriented magnetic field of strength b. the size of the emission region is set by the observed minimum variability time scale , @xmath9 , through    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the redshift to the source and @xmath12 is the doppler factor .",
    "the time evolution of the proton distribution is described by a okker - planck equation that incorporates cooling due to synchrotron radiation and pion production .",
    "the proton distribution interacts with the photon fields and generates relativistic pions .",
    "the pions subsequently decay to produce muons and muon neutrinos .",
    "the muons themselves also decay to produce electrons , positrons and muon and electron neutrinos .",
    "the evolution of each of the particle populations is described by their own fokker - planck equation .",
    "we assume that the proton injection spectrum takes the form of a power law distribution :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 denotes the heaviside function defined by @xmath15 if @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "the normalization factor for the proton injection spectrum is constrained through the proton injection luminosity , @xmath18 :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the comoving volume of the emission region and @xmath21 denotes the rest mass of the proton .",
    "all particles can be accelerated or decelerated by gyroresonant interactions with magnetohydrodynamic waves .",
    "this interaction causes the particle distribution to diffuse in energy , pushing particles to higher and lower energies .",
    "if the energy density of the plasma waves is small compared to the energy density of the magnetic field ( quasi - linear approximation ) , then the diffusion coefficient governing the momentum diffusion mentioned above , takes the form of a power - law ,    @xmath22    where the proportionality constant is set by the shock velocity , @xmath23 , and the alfvn velocity , @xmath24 :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 .",
    "we invoke a diffusion coefficient with a spectral index of @xmath27 ( hard sphere scattering ) .",
    "this allows the acceleration time scale to be independent of energy",
    ".      the protons also interact with the photon fields and produce neutral and charged pions .",
    "the total proton - photon cross section is divided into separate components , corresponding to different reaction channels through which the pions are produced : direct resonances ( such as the @xmath28 resonance ) , higher resonances , direct single - pion production and multi - pion production .",
    "we use the prescription developed by @xcite for the photo production rate of pions :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the proton distribution , @xmath31 denotes the photon field that the protons interact with as a function of the normalized photon energy @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( corresponding to an energy of 150  mev ) represents the threshold below which the cross sections are zero . the dimensionless variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by    @xmath36    @xmath37    the _ response function _ @xmath38 in the photo production rate of pions is given by    @xmath39    and is summed over all interaction channels that make up the proton - photon cross section as a function of photon energy in the parent nucleus rest frame , @xmath40 .",
    "the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the multiplicity of daughter particles and the mean energy fraction that is deposited into the daughter particles for a given interaction channel , respectively . evaluating these integrals",
    "turns out to be very cumbersome .",
    "therefore , @xcite suggest a simplified prescription in which the interactions are split up into separate components that take into account the resonances , direct production and multi - production channels and which assumes that the multiplicity and deposited mean energy fractions are independent of the interaction energy , @xmath43 .",
    "the response function then simplifies to :    @xmath44    with    @xmath45    with the simplified response function , the photo - production rate of pions can then be written in the more compact form :    @xmath46    this single integral is easy to evaluate numerically .",
    "the photo - production rate of pions now depends on the response function , @xmath47 , the multiplicities , @xmath48 , and the mean energy fraction deposited into the secondary particles , @xmath49 , for the dominant interaction types .",
    "the values of the multiplicities and the mean energy deposited for the resonance , direct production and multi - pion production as well as the response functions used , are tabulated in @xcite . with the formalism adopted for the pion production rates , the cooling time scale for the proton distribution from the production of pions",
    "is given by :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the inelasticity and @xmath52 the interaction rate of a given interaction type , given by :    @xmath53    using this formalism , the rate at which primary protons are lost due to conversion into neutrons can be given by the expression :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 denotes the new nucleon created in the photohadronic reaction .",
    "this formalism also allows the energy - loss term in the proton fokker - planck equation due to pion production to be defined as :    @xmath56    given that the radiative cooling time scales for protons can be longer than the typical dynamical time scale of the expansion of the emission region , we include adiabatic losses in our model . assuming a conical jet with an opening angle of @xmath57 , the adiabatic cooling rate is @xmath58 .",
    "the full proton fokker - planck equation that incorporates radiative losses due to synchrotron , adiabatic processes , pion production , neutron production as well as stochastic diffusion through the interaction mhd waves reads @xcite :    @xmath59 - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma }       ( \\dot{\\gamma } \\cdot n_{p } ( \\gamma , t ) ) + q_{p}(\\gamma , t ) -       \\frac{n_{p } ( \\gamma , t)}{t_{\\rm esc } } - \\frac{n_{p } ( \\gamma , t)}{t_{\\rm esc , n}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 denotes the dynamical escape time scale for the protons which we parameterize as a multiple of the light crossing time : @xmath61 where @xmath62 . the value of @xmath63 is kept as a free parameter . the term @xmath64 denotes the combined loss rates on the proton distribution due to adiabatic , synchrotron and pion production processes .",
    "the synchrotron loss rate is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "the decay time scale of neutral pions ( in the pion rest frame ) is only @xmath67  s , and they are not subject to synchrotron losses .",
    "therefore , in our code , neutral pions are assumed to decay instantaneously and so , no fokker - planck equation needs to be solved .",
    "the charged pions , however , have a significantly longer half life ( @xmath68  s in the pion rest frame ) , so a separate fokker - planck equation has to be considered for the charged pions produced in proton - photon interactions :    @xmath69 -       \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma } ( \\dot{\\gamma}_{rad } n_{p } ( \\gamma , t ) )       + q_{\\pi}(\\gamma , t ) - \\frac{n_{\\pi } ( \\gamma , t)}{t_{\\rm esc } } -       \\frac{n_{\\pi } ( \\gamma , t)}{\\gamma t'_{\\rm decay } } \\label{fppion}\\ ] ]    the only major difference comes from the loss term due to the decay of charged pions with a characteristic timescale @xmath70 . if the lorentz factors of the pions are large enough , the decay timescale could be of the order of or even larger than the pion synchrotron cooling time scale .    charged pions decay to produce muons through the following channels :    @xmath71    the decay term in the pion fokker - planck equation ( last term in eq .",
    "[ fppion ] ) serves as the injection function for the muon fokker - planck equation .",

    ", we have fokker - planck equations for the proton , electron / positron , muon , pion , and neutrino distributions that are all coupled to each other and represent all particle populations within the emission region .",
    "note that the electron / positron fokker - planck equation contains an additional injection term due to @xmath73 absorption and pair production , which allows us to properly follow the evolution of ultra - high - energy gamma - ray induced pair cascades ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "can be explained by a combination of synchrotron emission from electrons , protons , pions , and muons .",
    "the parameters used for the fit are chosen so that the radiative contributions from the pion and muon synchrotron radiation are non - negligible , and their contribution is essential for an adequate fit of the unusually hard vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum measured by magic .",
    "our fits for 3c 279 can be achieved with the jet being close to equipartition between the power carried in magnetic fields ( poynting flux ) and the kinetic energy in protons and electrons ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this contrasts most other hadronic models in which the particle kinetic luminosity is a few orders of magnitude larger than the magnetic luminosity .",
    "however , our model requires similarly large jet powers as other published hadronic blazar model fits ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , greatly in excess of the eddington luminosity of the central black hole in 3c279 ( @xmath105  erg  s@xmath106 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as the jet power is strongly beamed perpendicular to the accretion flow , it does not provide a radiation pressure that would be able to shut off the accretion flow .",
    "therefore , the eddington limit argument may not apply in such a case .",
    "nevertheless , the extreme jet production efficiency required for hadronic blazar jet models in general , may constitute a problem for this kind of models : the total jet power of @xmath107  erg  s@xmath106 exceeds the radiative luminosity of the accretion disk ( @xmath108  erg  s@xmath106 ) by almost 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "no jet production mechanism is currently known that would be able to produce steady jets with this efficiency ; however , the current understanding of the production of relativistic jets from supermassive black holes is still very limited .",

    "we have then simulated light curves by applying perturbations to a various input parameters in our code .",
    "the perturbations of the magnetic field and proton injection luminosity produced strong correlations between all bandpasses with @xmath109 hour time lags between the he @xmath1-ray and x - ray bandpass and @xmath110 hour time lags between the vhe and he @xmath1-ray bandpasses . also a temporary increase in the stochastic acceleration efficiency",
    "leads to correlated flares in the @xmath1-ray and x - ray bandpasses .",
    "this is in contrast to the the effects of such a perturbation on a time - dependent leptonic model @xcite , in which a drop in x - ray emission was predicted .",
    "the predicted variability features are well within reach of observational capabilities of currently operating x - ray and vhe @xmath1-ray observatories , but require extraordinarily high flux states to be measurable by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "our baseline ( quiescent - state ) model fit simulations predict integrated neutrino number fluxes at earth , over the icecube energy range for all three neutrino species , of @xmath111  @xmath112  s@xmath106 .",
    "given icecube s effective area of @xmath113  @xmath114 , this predicts neutrino detection rates of @xmath115  yr@xmath106 , thus requiring @xmath116  years for a significant detection of neutrinos from 3c279 in quiescence . even during flaring states , as studied in this paper , the neutrino flux is expected to increase by factors of a few",
    " a few tens , to expected detection rates of @xmath117  s@xmath106 , rendering it unlikely that icecube would be able to detect a neutrino signal correlated with @xmath1-ray flares from 3c279 .",
    "the most interesting features in our simulated lightcurve were plateaus and dips in the vhe @xmath1-ray bandpass as a result of perturbations of the acceleration time scale or the proton injection spectral index .",
