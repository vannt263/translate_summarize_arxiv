    "the classification of galaxies both acknowledges the complexity of these celestial objects and attempts to understand their formation and evolution . the hubble classification of galaxies @xcite recognises the dichotomy between , broadly speaking , disk and ellliptical galaxies , for historical reasons",
    "now often called late- and early - types .",
    "the classification works well on the late - type galaxies in particular , dividing the class into a number of subgroups which correlate with properties such as bulge - to - disk ratio , morphology of spiral arms , gas and dust content , to name a few , but it fails to bring a physical insight to our understanding of early - types @xcite , where the classification is based on apparent shape and thus dependant on viewing angles .    in an effort to eliminate the unsatisfactory situation @xcite proposed a revision of the hubble classification .",
    "it was based on two discoveries in the 1970s and 1980s , both enabled by an improvement in the technical capabilities of astronomical instruments .",
    "a series of papers @xcite showed that bright elliptical galaxies do not rotate as fast as they should , if they were oblate isotropic systems supported by rotation @xcite , whereas less bright and generally smaller systems , including also bulges of spirals , generally agree with such predictions @xcite . a complementary discovery that the fast rotating galaxies are more likely to have disky isophotes , while the slow rotating galaxies have boxy isophotes , linked again the kinematics and shape of galaxies .",
    "@xcite changed the uniformity of early - type galaxies to a dichotomy ( disky vs boxy , fast vs slow , brighter vs less bright ) and linked the whole hubble sequence from right to left , from sc ",
    "sa to s0e types , where rotation decreases in dynamical importance compared to random motions.    this important step forward introduced a readily measurable parameter related to some physical properties .",
    "however , the higher order variations in the isophotal shape ( diskiness / boxiness ) are not measurable at all inclinations regardless of the prominence of the disks @xcite , and finally , they are used to infer the dynamical state of the galaxy .",
    "this might be a decent approximation , especially if one assumes that all fast rotating galaxies comprise of spheroidal slow rotating components and disks seen at different inclination @xcite , but the edge - on observations of spheroidal components in spiral galaxies showed that bulges are rotating fast as well @xcite . to complicate things",
    "further the updated classification continues to distinguish s0s from es , keeping a viewing angle dependent definition of s0s @xcite .",
    "the choice of using the fourth order fourier term in the isophotometric analysis for classification is natural , because _",
    "( i ) _ it is much easier to take images of galaxies than to measure their kinematics , and _",
    "( ii ) _ until recently it was not realistic to spectroscopically map their two - dimensional structure .",
    "the advent of panoramic integral - field units , such as sauron @xcite , is changing the technical possibilities and the field itself ; it is now possible to systematically map kinematics of nearby galaxies up to their effective radii .",
    "we have observed 72 nearby e , s0 and sa galaxies as part of the sauron survey ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "focusing here on a subsample of 48 early - type galaxies ( e , s0 ) , these observations clearly show the previously hinted rich variety of kinematic substructures such as : kinematically decoupled cores , kinematic twists , counter - rotating structures and central disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "analysing the global properties of the sauron velocity and velocity dispersion maps , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ix ) were able to separate the early - type galaxies into two physically distinct classes of _ slow _ and _ fast _ rotators , according to their specific ( projected ) angular momentum measured within one effective radius , @xmath6 .",
    "this finding augments the view that led to the revision of the classification , but the sauron observations provide the crucial quantitive data .",
    "moreover , the results of paper ix suggest a way to dramatically improve on the hubble classification and substitute s0s and ( misclassified ) disky ellipticals with one class of fast rotators .",
    "* hereafter paper x ) addressed again the issue of orbital anisotropy of early - type galaxies .",
    "they constructed the ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) diagram @xcite using an updated formalism @xcite , and compared it with the results from general axisymmetric dynamical models for a subsample of these galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "they found that slow and fast rotators are clearly separated on the ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) diagram ( unlike es and s0s ) , such that slow rotators are round , moderately isotropic and are likely to be somewhat triaxial , while fast rotators appear flattened , span a larger range of anisotropies , but are mostly oblate axisymmetric objects .",
    "this finding is in a partial agreement with previous studies which either found round early - type galaxies radially anisotropic @xcite , moderately radially anisotropic @xcite or only weakly anisotropic with a range of anisotropies for flattened systems @xcite .",
    "the results of paper x , however , clearly show that intrinsically flatter galaxies tend to be more anisotropic in the meridional plane .",
    "the models also indicate that the fast rotators are often two component systems , having also a flat and rotating , kinematically distinct , disk - like component .",
    "dynamical models are often time consuming and difficult to construct .",
    "ultimately , one would like to be able to classify galaxies by their observable properties only .",
    "is it possible to learn about the intrinsic shapes of the early - type galaxies from observations only ?",
    "surface photometry , being but the zeroth moment of the ultimate observable quantity for distant galaxies , the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) , can not give the final answer .",
    "it is necessary to look at the other moments of the losvd : mean velocity , velocity dispersion and higher - order moments , commonly parameterised by gauss ",
    "hermite coefficients , @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , which measure asymmetric and symmetric deviation of the losvd from a gaussian , respectively .    indeed , in the last dozen years several studies investigated higher moments of the losvd of early - type galaxies observing them along one or multiple slits .",
    "these studies deepened the dichotomy among early - type galaxies showing that fast rotating galaxies with disky isophotes also exhibit an anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with these galaxies being made of two components : a bulge and a disk .",
    "the symmetric deviations , on the other hand are usually smaller than asymmetric ones , and somewhat positive in general .",
    "in addition , the observed higher order moments of the losvd can be used to constrain the possible merger scenarios of early - type galaxies and their formation in general .",
    "however , observations along one or two slits are often not able to describe the kinematical richness of early - type galaxies .    in this work",
    "we use _ kinemetry _",
    "@xcite , a generalisation of surface photometry to all moments of the losvd , to study sauron maps of 48 early - type galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate observational clues from resolved two - dimensional kinematics for the origin of the differences between the slow and fast rotators .    in section  [ s :",
    "dat ] we briefly remind the reader of the sauron observations and data reduction .",

    "the main results are presented in section  [ s : res ] . in section  [",
    "s : disc ] we offer an interpretation of the results and we summarise the conclusions in section  [ s : conc ] . in appendix  [ s : psf ] we discuss the influence of seeing on the two - dimensional kinematics and in appendix  [ s : profiles ] we present the radial profiles of the kinemetric coefficients used in this study .",
    "in this work we used the data from the sauron sample which was designed to be _ representative _ of the galaxy populations in the plane of ellipticity , @xmath7 , versus absolute @xmath8 band magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "the sample and its selection details are presented in paper ii . in this study",
    "we focus on the 48 galaxies of the sauron e+s0 sample .",
    "sauron is an integral - field spectrograph with a field - of - view ( fov ) of about @xmath10 and @xmath11 square lenses , mounted at the william herschel telescope . complementing the sauron large scale fov",
    ", we probed the nuclear regions of a number of galaxies with oasis , then mounted at canada - hawaii - france telescope , a high spatial resolution integral - field spectrograph , similarly to sauron based on the tiger concept .",
    "the fov of oasis is only @xmath12 , but the spatial scale is @xmath13 , fully sampling the seeing - limited point spread function and providing on average a factor of 2 improvement in spatial resolution over sauron .",
    "the spectral resolution of oasis is , however , about 20% lower than that of sauron , and only a sub - sample of the sauron galaxies was observed .    in this paper",
    "we are investigating the stellar kinematics of early - type galaxies .",
    "paper iii and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper viii ) discuss the extraction of kinematics and construction of maps of the mean velocity @xmath14 , the velocity dispersion @xmath15 , and the gauss - hermite moments @xmath0 and @xmath1 in great detail .",
    "all maps used in this work are voronoi binned @xcite to the same signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the sauron kinematic data used here are of the same kinematic extraction as in paper x with the latest improvement on the template mismatch effects in higher moments of the losvd .",
    "the sauron mean velocity maps are repeated in this paper for the sake of clarity , but we encourage the reader to have copies of both paper iii and paper viii available for reference on other moments of the losvd .",
    "maps of the moments of the losvd offer a wealth of information , but also suffer from complexity .",
    "it is difficult , if not impossible , to show error bars for each bin on the map , and the richness of the maps can lead to the useful information being lost in detail . as in the case of imaging ,",
    "it is necessary to extract the useful information from the maps to profit from their two - dimensional coverage of the objects . in this section",
    "we describe the method used to analyse the maps and discuss definitions utilised throughout the paper .",
    "@xcite presented kinemetry , as a quantitative approach to analysis of maps of kinematic moments .",
    "kinemetry is a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher - order moments of the losvd .",
    "the moments of the losvd have odd or even parity .",
    "the surface brightness ( zeroth moment ) is even , the mean velocity ( first moment ) is odd , the velocity dispersion ( second moment ) is even , etc .",
    "kinemetry is based on the assumption that for the odd moments the profile along the ellipse satisfies a simple cosine law , while for the even moments the profile is constant ( the same assumption is also used in surface photometry ) .",
    "kinemetry derives such best - fitting ellipses and analyses the profiles of the moments extracted along these by means of harmonic decomposition .",
    "it follows from this that the application of kinemetry on even moments is equivalent to surface photometry resulting in the same coefficients for parameterisation of the structures ( e.g position angle , ellipticity and fourth order harmonics ) .",
    "application of kinemetry on odd maps such as velocity maps map .... ] provides radial profiles of the kinematic position angle pa@xmath16 , axis ratio or flattening , q@xmath16=b / a ( where b and a are lengths of minor and major axis , respectively ) , and odd harmonic terms obtained from the fourier expansion ( since velocity is an odd map , even terms are , in principle , not present , while in practice are very small and usually negligible ) . in the case of stellar velocity maps ,",
    "the dominant kinemetry term is @xmath17 , representing the velocity amplitude , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the first sine and cosine terms , respectively .",
    "the deviations from the assumed simple cosine law are given by the first higher order term that is not fitted , @xmath20 , usually normalised with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "these four parameters form the basis of our analysis because they quantify the kinematical properties of the observed galaxies : orientation of the map ( a projection of the angular momentum ) , opening angle of the iso - velocity contours , the amplitude of the rotation and the deviation from the assumed azimuthal variation of the velocity map . for the other moments of the losvd one could derive similar quantities , depending on the parity of the moment . as will be discussed below , we focus on kinemetry coefficients that describe velocity maps in detail and some specific kinemetry coefficients from the maps of the higher order moments . a detailed description of the method , error analysis and parameters is given in @xcite .",
    "kinemetric radial profiles can be obtained along ellipses of different axial ratios and position angles . at each radius",
    "there is the best fitting ellipse , along which a profile of the kinematic moment will have a certain shape : it follows a cosine or it is constant , for odd and even moments , respectively . if this is the case , the higher order fourier terms are non - existent or at least negligible for such an ellipse .    in the case of even moments ,",
    "the best fitting ellipses describe the underlying iso - contours , like isophotes in the case of surface photometry , or contours of constant velocity dispersion , iso-@xmath15 contours . in the case of odd moments , this is somewhat more difficult to visualise , but the axial ratio of the best - fitting ellipse is related to the opening angle of the iso - velocity contours : the larger the axial ratio , the more open is the spider diagram of the velocity map .    in this study",
    ", kinemetry is used for extraction of parameters in the following ways :    * we apply kinemetry to sauron reconstructed images of galaxies , which are obtained by summing the spectra along the spectral direction at each sky position .",
    "this is equivalent to low resolution surface photometry on galaxies from the sample .",
    "we focus on the photometric position angle pa@xmath22  and photometric axial ratio , related to ellipticity as q@xmath22=1-@xmath7 . in this case",
    ", kinemetry is used in its _ even _ mode , where even harmonics are fitted to the profiles extracted along the best fitting ellipses .",
    "* we use kinemetry to derive radial profiles of the four parameters that describe velocity maps : pa@xmath16 , q@xmath16 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", kinemetry is applied to the maps in its _ odd _ mode , when only odd fourier harmonics are fit to the profiles extracted along the best fitting ellipses , which are , in general , different from the best fitting ellipse of _ ( i)_. in some cases when it is not possible to determine the best - fitting ellipse we run kinemetry on circles ( see below ) . *",
    "kinemetry is applied to velocity dispersion maps , using the _ even _ mode as in _",
    "( i)_. in this case , however , the parameters of the ellipses used to extract profiles were fixed to the best fitting values of surface photometry obtained in _ ( i)_. * maps of gauss - hermite coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 were also parameterised using kinemetry in _ odd _ and _ even _ mode , respectively . in both cases , we used the best fitting ellipses from the lowest _ odd _ ( velocity map ) and _ even _ moment ( reconstructed image ) , respectively .    before proceeding it is worth explaining in more detail our decision not to use kinemetry to fit the ellipses in some cases",
    "( ii ) _ we mentioned that on some velocity maps it was necessary to run kinemetry on circles .",
    "in general , the mean stellar velocity has an odd parity , and its map , in an inclusive triaxial case , will be point - antisymmetric .",
    "certain maps , however , do not follow this rule , having no detectable net rotation , e.g. ngc4486 , or the inner part of ngc4550 . in the latter case ,",
    "the zero velocity in the inner part can be explained by the superposition of two counter - rotating stellar components as advocated by @xcite and @xcite , where the mass of the counter - rotating component is about 50% of the total mass ( paper x ) . in other cases",
    "the non rotation could be a result of dominant box orbits which have zero angular momentum .",
    "the basic assumption of kinemetry for odd kinematic moments therefore breaks down resulting in velocity maps that appear noisy and one can not expect reasonable results .    in practice",
    ", this means that the best - fitting ellipse parameters for maps without net rotation will not be robustly determined ( degeneracy in both pa@xmath16and q@xmath16 ) while the higher harmonic terms will be large and meaningless .",
    "specifically , @xmath23 will have high values .",
    "we partially alleviate this degeneracy by first running an unconstrained kinemetry fit on stellar velocity maps and identifying maps where @xmath24 and corresponding radii where it occurs . at these radii",
    "we re - run kinemetry , but using circles for extraction of velocity profiles and fourier analysis . in this way we set the axial ratio q@xmath16=1 in order to break the degeneracy .",
    "although the @xmath2 term can not be directly compared with the @xmath2 term obtained from a best - fitting ellipse , in this case , if there is any indication of odd parity in the map , we can still determine the local amplitude of rotation @xmath21 , and give a good estimate for pa@xmath16 .",
    "the other note refers to items _ ( iii ) _ and _ ( iv)_. although , in principle , it would be possible to run kinemetry freely on the velocity dispersion maps , or maps of higher gauss - hermite moments ( e.g. @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , the noise in the data is too high to give trustworthy results for the whole sample . by setting the shape of the curve to the best - fitting ellipses of the corresponding lowest odd or even",
    "moment , the harmonic terms of kinemetry quantify the differences between these even and odd moments of the losvd .",
    "* left : * voronoi binned stellar velocity dispersion maps of ngc2549 ( top ) and ngc4473 ( bottom ) .",
    "over - plotted lines are isophotes . in the lower right corner of each map are values that correspond to minimum and maximum colours on the colour bar . *",
    "right : * radial profiles of @xmath25 kinemetry terms for ngc2549 ( top ) and ngc4473 ( bottom ) . ]",
    "an example of expected differences can be visualised comparing the isophotes of the surface brightness and the stellar velocity dispersion maps of ngc2549 and ngc4473 ( fig .",
    "[ f : diff ] ) . on both images isophotes",
    "are aligned with the vertical ( y ) axis of the maps . in the case of ngc2549 the contours of constant velocity dispersion",
    "seem to be perpendicular to the isophotes , at least within the central 10 , while in the rather unusual case of ngc4473 , the high values of velocity dispersion have the same orientation as the isophotes .",
    "the physical explanation of these striking differences should be looked for in the internal orbital structure .",
    "we postpone this discussion to section  [ ss : shape ] .",
    "the noise and irregular shape of iso-@xmath15 contours decrease the usefulness of fitting for the velocity dispersion contours . extracting harmonic terms along the isophotes , however , can yield a clear signal of the different shape of these two moments .",
    "an extracted velocity dispersion profile in these two cases ( for example along the second brightest isophote shown on fig .",
    "[ f : diff ] ) will go through two maxima and two minima .",
    "the minima and maxima of these two profiles will be out of phase , because along the major axis in ngc2549 there is a decrease in velocity dispersion while in ngc4473 there is an increase",
    ". the decomposition of these two profiles will give different amplitudes to the harmonic terms .",
    "specifically , @xmath26 ( cosine ) term will be the most influenced , because this term is related to the error in the axial ratio @xcite , and the shapes such as in ngc2549 and ngc4473 will give negative ( iso-@xmath15 rounder than isophotes ) and positive ( iso-@xmath15 flatter than isophotes ) @xmath26 , respectively . an alternative way to visualise",
    "the difference between these two maps based on the values of @xmath26 is to consider that a negative @xmath27 corresponds to a decrease of the @xmath15 at the major axis of the best fitting ellipse compared to the @xmath15 measured at the minor axis of the best fitting ellipse ( ngc2549 ) . in contrast , a positive @xmath26 corresponds to an increased value of the @xmath15 at the major axis position of the best fitting ellipse ( ngc4473 ) . by monitoring these harmonic terms",
    "it is possible to quantify the shape difference between the observed zeroth and second moments of the losvd .",
    "a few kinemetric profiles are able to describe a wealth of information from the maps .",
    "specifically , we wish to use them to highlight the kinematic structures on the maps and to recognise hidden kinematic components . here",
    "we present a set of quantitative criteria for describing features on the stellar velocity maps .",
    "some of the criteria are dependent on the quality of the data and they should be modified if used on maps obtained with other ifus .",
    "the following rules were presented by @xcite and paper ix , but here we list them for the sake of clarity .",
    "a single velocity map can contain a number of kinematic components .",
    "often they are easily recognisable by visual inspection . in a quantitive way we differentiate between :    * _ single component _",
    "( sc ) map : having a radially constant or slow varying pa@xmath16and q@xmath16profiles . * _ multiple component _ ( mc )",
    "map : characterised with an abrupt change in either : @xmath28q@xmath16@xmath29 , or @xmath28pa@xmath16@xmath30 , or a double - hump in @xmath21 with a local minimum in between , or a peak in @xmath23 where @xmath31 .",
    "mc maps are clearly more complex than sc maps .",
    "the above values for changes to the kinemetric coefficients are used to determine the extent of each subcomponent ( components @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 with radii @xmath35 and @xmath36 between them ) .",
    "each subcomponent can be described as being of the following type ( limiting values apply for the sauron dataset ) :    * _ disc - like rotation _",
    "( dr ) : defined when the higher order harmonic @xmath37 , while the variation of q@xmath16  and pa@xmath16   is less than 0.1 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "note that this name _ does not _ imply that the object is a disk intrinsically .",
    "* _ low - level velocity _ ( lv ) : defined when the maximum of @xmath21 is lower than @xmath39 .",
    "a special case is _ central low - level velocity _ ( clv ) when lv occurs in the central kinematical component on the map .",
    "* _ kinematic misalignment _ ( km ) : defined when the absolute difference between the photometric pa@xmath22  and kinemetric position pa@xmath16  angles is larger than @xmath38 . * _ kinematic twist _ ( kt ) : defined by a smooth variation of the kinematics position angle pa@xmath16  with an amplitude of at least @xmath38 within the extent of the kinematic component . * _ kinematically decoupled component _",
    "( kdc ) : if there is an abrupt change in pa@xmath16 , with a difference larger than @xmath40 between two adjacent components , or if there is an outer lv component ( in which case the measurement of pa@xmath16  is uncertain ) .",
    "a special case of kdcs are _",
    "counter rotating cores _",
    "( crc ) where @xmath41pa@xmath16  between the components is @xmath42 ( within the uncertainties ) .",
    "most of the above definitions are new , arising from two - dimensional maps which offer a more robust detection of structures .",
    "the definition of kdc is , however , similar to the one used in the past , where the two - dimensional coverage enables a determination of the orientation of the kinematic components .",
    "it should be noted that classification of a kinematic component as a clv is strongly dependent on the spatial resolution of the instrument .",
    "as will be seen later , higher spatial resolution can change the appearance and therefore the classification of the components .",
    "similarly , it should be stressed that the limiting values used for these definitions are geared towards the sauron data .",
    "the oasis data , due to different instrumental properties and observing set - up , will have somewhat different limiting values , mostly arising in the higher order fourier terms .",
    "for example , the mean uncertainty of @xmath2 term for the oasis sample is 0.033 , significantly higher compared to the one for the sauron sample ( 0.015 ) . in order to treat consistently the two data sets ,",
    "we adopt a somewhat more conservative value of 0.04 as the limiting values for @xmath2 in definition of dr component when estimated from the oasis data .",
    "while abrupt changes in the orientation , axial ratio , or velocity amplitude are intuitively clear as evidences for separate kinematic components , the @xmath2 as an indicator of components is more complex to comprehend .",
    "still , the simple models of two kinematic components rotating at a given relative orientation give rise to @xmath2 term in the kinemetric expansion in the region where these components overlap @xcite .",
    "since we measure luminosity weighted velocities , the position and extent of the raised @xmath2 region depends on relative luminosity contributions of the components , marking the transition radii between the components and not their start or end .",
    "furthermore , it is also , necessary , to distinguish between high @xmath2 due to a super - position of kinematic components ( a genuine signal ) and high @xmath2 originating from noisy maps , such as maps with no detectable rotation ( e.g. ngc4486 ) or large bin - to - bin variations ( e.g. oasis map of ngc3379 ) . for our data , when the signal in @xmath23 is @xmath43 of @xmath21 , we consider the noise too high and the @xmath2 ratio not usable for detecting individual components .",
    "robust estimates of the number of sub - components in velocity maps and their sizes are influenced by three major factors : data quality , physical properties and seeing . while the data quality is described by measurement uncertainties , and in that sense it is quantifiable to some extent , the other two factors are more complex . by physical properties",
    "we assume physical processes that hide kinematic information from our view , such as specific orientation of the object , dust obscuration or simply the fact that we are measuring luminosity weighted quantities and we might miss kinematic components made up of stars that constitute a low luminosity fraction of the total population .",
    "the influence of seeing is particularly relevant for subcomponents in the centres of galaxies . in appendix  [ s : psf ] we tested the dependence of the kinemetric coefficients on representative seeings , for velocity maps viewed at different orientations .",
    "this exercise showed that : _",
    "pa@xmath16  and @xmath2 are not significantly influenced by the seeing , _",
    "( ii ) _ the amplitude and , to a minor extent , the shape of @xmath21 are somewhat influenced by the seeing , and _",
    "( iii ) _ the axial ratio q@xmath16  can be strongly influenced by the seeing ( fig .",
    "[ f : prof_fwhm ] ) .",
    "in addition to these conclusions , the test showed that the inclination of an object is also a factor contributing to the change of the intrinsic q@xmath16 , and to a minor extent , @xmath21 profiles , where higher inclinations are particularly influenced by the seeing effects .    in practice , this means that the change in q@xmath16  is a less robust indicator of kinematic components .",
    "we found that more robust indicators are abrupt changes in @xmath2 and pa@xmath16  profiles , double humps in @xmath21 profiles or decrease of @xmath21 amplitude below our detection limit for rotation .",
    "we used these as estimates of the sizes of kinematic components .",
    "it should be , however , noted that the size of a component is just a luminosity weighted estimate , originating from a super - position of luminosities of individual components , and the component can intrinsically extend beyond that radius",
    ". only detailed dynamical models could give a more robust estimate of the internal orbital structure .",
    "in addition to radial profiles we present in this paper a number of average quantities .",
    "similar luminosity - weighted quantities have already been derived in papers ix and x : global pa@xmath16 , global pa@xmath22 , average @xmath7 . in this study",
    "we use the velocity maps to determine the luminosity weighted average @xmath44pa@xmath16@xmath45 , @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 , and @xmath46 for the whole map and for each kinematic component .",
    "we also measured the luminosity weighted @xmath44pa@xmath22@xmath45 , @xmath44q@xmath22@xmath45 from the reconstructed images ( both global and for each component ) , @xmath47 from velocity dispersion maps and average values of @xmath1 ( measured as the @xmath48 harmonic term ) from @xmath1 maps . in practice , we do this following the expression from paper ix .",
    "the mean @xmath49 of a quantity @xmath50 derived from its sampled radial profiles can be approximated with : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the axial ratio and the surface brightness of the best fit ellipse , with semi - major axis @xmath54 .",
    "( [ eq : av ] ) is based on an expression defined in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of these average values are calculated in the standard way as the sum of the quadratic differences between the average value and the value at each position @xmath54 .    in paper",
    "x the global pa@xmath16  was derived using the formalism from appendix c in @xcite .",
    "this approach differs from the one described here in the sense that it is less sensitive to the kinematic structures in the central region , such as abrupt changes of pa in case of a kdc .",
    "that approach is well suited for making global comparisons between pa@xmath16  or pa@xmath22 , such as global kinematic misalignment , when it is required that they are measured on large scales to avoid influence of local perturbations in the nuclear regions ( e.g. seeing , dust , bars ) . in this study , however , we want to compare the radial properties of different moments of the losvd and for that reason we use the approach of paper ix to all measured quantities .",
    "note that for the purpose of the direct comparison we measured both kinematic and photometric quantities on the sauron data , in contrast with papers ix and x.",
    "in this section we present the results of kinemetric analysis of the losvd moments maps .",
    "we look at the presence of kinematic substructures in velocity maps ( section  [ ss : subcomp ] ) , properties of radial profiles of pa@xmath16 , @xmath21 , @xmath15 ( section  [ ss : srfr ] ) , comparison between q@xmath16  and q@xmath22  ( section  [ ss : flat ] ) , the shape difference between isophotes and iso-@xmath15 contours ( section  [ ss : shape ] ) and properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauss - hermite moments ( section  [ ss : high ] ) with the purpose to investigate the internal structure of sauron galaxies .",
    "kinemetry probes local characteristics of galaxies , and we wish to link those with the global properties described in papers ix and x. in this analysis , the most useful is the first moment of the losvd , the mean velocity , because it is a moment rich in structure and with the strongest signal .",

    "[ f : prof ] ) the following general conclusions can be made :    * pa@xmath16  profiles are in general smooth and often constant ( e.g. ngc2974 ) or mildly varying ( e.g. ngc474 ) . in some cases there are abrupt changes of up to @xmath42 within @xmath55 ( e.g. ngc3608 ) .",
    "* profiles of the axial ratio q@xmath16  are generally smooth and often similar to q@xmath22  profiles ( e.g. ngc1023 , ngc3384 , ngc4570 ) .",
    "* there is a variety of @xmath21 profiles , most of them rise and flatten , but some continue to rise , while some drop ( e.g. ngc4278 , ngc4477 and ngc4546 ) .",
    "* considering the @xmath2 radial dependence , there are three kinds of objects : those that have the ratio below 0.02 along most of the radius ( e.g. ngc2974 ) , those that have the ratio greater than 0.1 along most of the radius ( e.g. ngc4374 ) and those that have the ratio below 0.02 with one ( or more ) humps above this value ( e.g. ngc2549 ) . *",
    "objects with @xmath24 along a significant part of the profile from sauron data are all classified as slow rotators in paper ix ( e.g. ngc4486 ) .    a further step in understanding the complex velocity maps can be made by applying definitions of kinemetric groups ( see section  [ ss : def_comp ] ) to the radial profiles .",
    "they are summarised in table  [ t : kin_prop ] .",
    "there are 15 galaxies characterised as sc ( 31% ) ) , it is formally characterised as a sc galaxy due to its low velocity within the sauron fov . ] , the rest being mc galaxies ( 69% ) of which 10 have kdc ( 21% ) and 4 clv ( 8% ) .",
    "higher resolution observations with oasis , however , show that all sauron clvs are in fact small kdcs and , moreover , crcs ( paper viii ) .",
    "this means that there are actually 14 ( 29% ) kdcs in the sauron sample .",
    "kinematic profiles of the oasis data also clearly show structures that are partially resolved in the sauron observations , such as kdc ( ngc4621 , ngc5198 , ngc5982 ) or co - rotating components which often have larger amplitudes of rotation in the oasis data , corresponding to the nuclear disks visible on the hst images . the effects of specific nuclear kinematics , related mean ages of the components and possible different formation paths were previously discussed in paper viii .     a relation between the maximum amplitude of rotation and luminosity - weighted average of @xmath2 ratio , which measures departures from the cosine law for velocity profiles extracted along the best fitting ellipse .",
    "all points belong to fast rotators . ]    in addition to this grouping of the velocity maps , we can also describe the kinematic components .",
    "out of 15 sc galaxies , 8 are dr ( 53% ) , 2 are kt ( 13% ) and 4 are lv ( 27% ) , while the remaining galaxy ( ngc2768 ) is a rather special case of a solid body rotator ( see below ) .",
    "the majority of mc galaxies have only two kinematic components ( 30 or 91% ) , but there are some with three kinematic components ( 3 or 9% ) .",
    "many of the components are similar in properties .",
    "if the inner component ( @xmath32 ) is dr then the second component ( @xmath33 ) is also a dr . if @xmath32 has a more complex kinematic structures ( kdc , lv , kt ) , @xmath33 or @xmath34 will in most cases still be a dr .",
    "exceptions are found in a few cases when @xmath33 is not rotating and can be described as lv . in some cases components",
    "may show kt , but their @xmath2 ratio is less than or equal to 0.02 . counting all galaxies that have at least one component with @xmath56 , the number of systems with dr - like characteristics rises to 35 ( 73% ) . in terms of e / s0 classification",
    ", this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components with disk - like kinematics    using the resolving power of the oasis data we can go even further : allowing for large error bars and allowing for considerable uncertainty of component boundaries , virtually every galaxy that shows rotation ( including parts of kdcs ) has at least one region with @xmath56 ( 0.04 in oasis ) .",
    "this can be seen on fig .",
    "[ f : k1_k51 ] that shows luminosity weighted average of @xmath2 ratio versus the maximum rotational amplitude @xmath21 for all fast rotators measured on the sauron data .",
    "the large uncertainties in some cases reflect the multiple component nature of fast rotators , because @xmath2 ratio rises in the transition region between components @xcite .",
    "notably , both average values and uncertainties rise as the maximum rotation velocity decreases .",
    "this suggest a more complex structure ( more components , larger difference between components ) in galaxies with lower amplitude of rotation .",
    "we estimated local kinematic misalignment for each kinematic component .",
    "the results show that a total of 25 galaxies ( 52% of the sample ) have some evidence of km .",
    "it should , however , be kept in mind that it is difficult to determine the sense of rotation for lv components .",
    "ignoring galaxies with a lv in the single component or in the second component , we are left with 15 galaxies with kinematic misalignments . of these ,",
    "13 galaxies show misalignment in the first component , and 7 in the second component .",
    "moreover , only 5 galaxies show misalignment in two components , as a global property within the sauron field of view .",
    "as it can be seen from the kinemetric profiles there are special cases for which kinemetry is not able to determine the characteristic parameters robustly .",
    "this , in general , occurs when velocity drops below @xmath57 ( e.g. ngc4486 , ngc4550 ) , and it is not surprising since these maps also often lack odd parity , an expected property of the first moment of the losvd . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "another exception is the case of solid body rotation for which the iso - contours are parallel with the zero - velocity curve . in the sauron sample",
    "this is seen in ngc2768 .",
    "since the velocity iso - contours are parallel the axial - ratio and the position angle are poorly defined and in practice strongly influenced by noise in the data .",
    "determination of the best - fit ellipse parameters for the solid body rotation is degenerate . from these reasons this galaxy should also be considered with care when comparing with kinemetry results for other objects .",
    "as stated above , all galaxies with @xmath24 along a significant part of the profile from sauron data are classified as slow rotators in paper ix . to some extent",
    "this is expected since slow rotators in general show very little rotation and kinemetry assumptions are not satisfied .",
    "the origin of the noise in the maps of slow rotators , which generates large @xmath2 , is likely reflecting a special internal structure , and , in principal , does not come from technical aspects of the observations .",
    "even velocity maps with low amplitude of rotation could show regular spider diagrams ( e.g. disks seen at very low inclinations ) observed at the same signal - to - noise .",
    "the one - to - one relation between slow rotators and objects with large higher - order harmonic terms is significant since the slow / fast rotator classification is based on both velocity and velocity dispersion maps and reflects the internal structure .",
    "the oasis data cover only a small fraction of the effective radius and do not show this relationship .",
    "the slow rotators ngc3414 ,",
    "ngc3608 , ngc5813 and ngc5982 show considerable rotation because the kdc is covering the full oasis fov , while the central regions of the fast rotators ngc2768 , ngc3032 and ngc3379 still have small amplitudes of rotation and high ( and noisy ) @xmath2 ratios .    the velocity maps of the 12 slow rotating galaxies in our sample can be described either as lv or as kdc+lv . in that respect ,",
    "4 slow rotators are sc systems ( ngc4374 , ngc4486 , ngc4550 and ngc5846 ) which do not show any detectable rotation ( at sauron resolution ) and the other 8 are mc systems where @xmath32 is a kdc and @xmath33 is a lv . in between these two cases is ngc4552 with a rather constant rotation velocity of @xmath58 , the boundary level for lv , and the @xmath32 between a kdc and a large kt .",
    "the other three quarters of galaxies in the sauron sample are fast rotators .",
    "only a third of them are described as sc , but as shown above ( section  [ ss : subcomp ] ) all fast rotators have components with kinematics that can be described as dr .",
    "moreover , in the case of some slow rotators with small , but not negligible rotation in the centres ( kdc ) , the higher resolution oasis data were able to ascertain that these components have near to dr properties ( within often large uncertainties )    figure  [ f : radp ] has three panels highlighting most obvious kinematic properties of slow and fast rotators .",
    "the top panel shows radial variations of the kinematic position angles , pa@xmath16 , which are present in various forms , ranging from minor twists in the nuclei , through abrupt jumps at the end of kdcs , to almost random changes with radius .",
    "however , only pa@xmath16  of slow rotators are characterised by strong and rapid changes .",
    "fast rotators show remarkably constant pa@xmath16 .",
    "if twists are present in pa@xmath16of fast rotators , they are small in amplitude ( @xmath59 ) and confined to the nuclear region in shapes of physically small kdcs ( ngc4150 , ngc4382 , ngc4621 , ngc7332 , ngc7457 ) .",
    "slow rotators on the other hand show a much greater amplitude in change of pa@xmath16 .",
    "it should be stressed again that determination of pa@xmath16  for slow rotators is much more ill defined than for fast rotators in the sense that if there is no rotation , there is also no orientation of rotation .",
    "the abrupt changes in pa@xmath16  are the consequence of this in some cases ( ngc4374 , ngc4486 , ngc4550 , ngc5846 ) , and while one could debate the robustness of measured pa@xmath16 , one should acknowledge the different nature of these systems from objects with a constant pa@xmath16 .",
    "radial profiles of ( from top to bottom ) pa@xmath16 - @xmath44pa@xmath16@xmath45 , @xmath21 and @xmath60 from the sauron data .",
    "@xmath44pa@xmath16@xmath45 are luminosity weighted averages of pa@xmath16  profiles .",
    "@xmath60 profiles are normalised at @xmath61/5 .",
    "the profiles of slow and fast rotators are coloured in red and black , respectively . in the middle panel dashed blue lines are over - plotted to guide the eye for the cases with specific profiles as mentioned in text . ]",
    "the difference between the slow and fast rotators is most visible in the amplitude of rotation .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ f : radp ] , shows the radial profiles of @xmath21 kinemetric terms for 48 early - type galaxies .",
    "most of the profiles cover up to 1 @xmath61 in radius .",
    "slow rotating galaxies can show a non - zero amplitude of rotation in the centres ( kdcs ) , but the amplitude is , in general , not very high and towards the edge of the map it is mostly negligible .",
    "the only exception is ngc5982 , which approaches two fast rotators with the slowest rotation in the outer regions ( ngc4278 and ngc4473 ) .",
    "another characteristic of this plot is the variety of profiles .",
    "they include : monotonically rising profiles ( e.g. ngc3032 ) , profiles with an initial slow rise which turns to a more rapid one ( e.g. ngc524 ) , a rapid rise to a maximum followed by a plateau ( e.g. ngc4546 ) , rise to a maximum followed by a decrease ( e.g. ngc4526 ) , double hump profiles ( e.g. ngc4660 ) , flat profiles ( e.g. ngc821 ) and , in slow rotators , profiles showing a decrease below our detection limit . keeping in mind",
    "that the sauron sample is not a complete sample , among fast rotators there are 17 ( 47% ) with increasing profile at the edge of the sauron map , 9 ( 25% ) have flat profiles , 5 ( 14% ) decreasing profiles and 4 galaxies have intermediate ( difficult to classify ) profiles",
    ". among slow rotators there are 3 ( 25% ) galaxies with increasing profiles at the edge of the map , the rest being flat and below the detection limit .",
    "these statistics are influenced by the size of velocity maps and the coverage of kinematics components by kinemetric ellipses .",
    "clearly , larger scale observations would detect the end of rise in amplitude in galaxies that are now observed to have increasing @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , it is possible that a decrease in @xmath21 could be followed by an additional increase or a flat profile at large radii .",
    "still , there are two general conclusions for fast rotators : they mostly show increasing velocity profiles at @xmath62 , where the range of maximum velocity amplitude spans 200 @xmath63 . on the other hand , slow rotators have velocity amplitude mostly less than @xmath64 at @xmath62 .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ f : radp ] shows radial velocity dispersion profiles , @xmath60 , extracted along the isophotes from the velocity dispersion maps as @xmath48 harmonic terms .",
    "all profiles are normalised to their value at @xmath65 .",
    "this highlights the similar general shape of the @xmath60 radial profiles .",
    "the only outlier is ngc4550 with an @xmath60 profile which increases with radius .",
    "most of the other profiles , while different in detail , show a general trend of increasing @xmath60 towards the centre and also have a similar shape .",
    "a few profiles are consistent with being flat ( @xmath66/@xmath67 ) over the whole profile ( visible only in fast rotators such as ngc7457 ) .    if there are any real differences between @xmath60 profiles , they are apparent for radii smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "there are a few exceptions to the general trend : _",
    "i ) _ profiles with a decrease of more than 5% in the normalised @xmath60 within @xmath65 ( e.g. ngc4382 ) , _ ii ) _ profiles that are flat to within 5% inside the @xmath65 ( e.g. ngc7457 ) , and _",
    "iii ) _ profiles with a central rise followed by a drop and consecutive rise forming a profile with double maxima ( e.g. ngc5813 ) .",
    "these cases occur mostly in fast rotators , with a few exceptions in slow rotators .",
    "these central plateaus and drops are interesting , because classical theoretical work predicts that , for constant mass - to - light ratio , @xmath68 light - profiles have velocity dispersion minima in the centres of galaxies , unless they contain central black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the central @xmath15-drops evidently do not occur frequently in real early - type galaxies , but are , perhaps marginally more common to fast rotators .",
    "about 10% of the sauron early - types exhibit the central drop ( but additional 20% have flat central profiles ) , which is much less compared to 46% among the sa bulges , also observed with sauron data @xcite .",
    "we now compare average photometric and kinematic axial ratios of sauron galaxies .",
    "the axial ratio of a velocity map is related to the opening angle of the iso - velocity contours . in other words ,",
    "the pinching of the contours in a spider diagram is related to the axial ratio of the best fitting ellipse given by kinemetry . as the kinematic axial ratio of slow rotators is an ill defined quantity ( set to 1 ) , in the rest of this section we focus on the average axial ratios of the fast rotators .    in fig .",
    "[ f : qkvqp ] we compare values of @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 and @xmath44q@xmath22@xmath45 for fast rotating galaxies . since the typical seeing for sauron data ranges up to @xmath69 , we exclude the inner @xmath70 of the q@xmath16  profiles from our derivation of the luminosity weighted average values ( appendix  [ s : psf ] ) .",
    "the left hand panel shows a one - to - one correlation between the two quantities , although the scatter and uncertainties are large .",
    "the right hand panel shows more clearly the amount of scatter in these relations , as measured by the difference @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 - @xmath44q@xmath22@xmath45 .",
    "the typical variation of the measured average @xmath28q@xmath16  is 0.1 , as shown with vertical guidelines on the right panel . outside this region",
    "there are about dozen galaxies .",
    "a few of these have @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 larger than @xmath44q@xmath22@xmath45 ; their photometric axial ratio is flatter than the kinematic , while the majority of outliers have the kinematic axial ratio flatter than the photometric .",
    "let us consider in more detail only objects at significant distances from the vertical lines ( i.e. @xmath44qk@xmath71qp@xmath72 ) : ngc821 , ngc4270 , ngc4473 , ngc4621 , ngc5308 and ngc5838 .    if we look at the q@xmath16  profiles of the three galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ f : vel_prof ] ) with @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath73q@xmath22@xmath45 , we can see that some of their kinematic sub - components have axial ratios very similar to the local photometric axial ratios .",
    "notably , in the case of ngc5308 this is the outer component , especially at radii near to the edge of the sauron fov .",
    "the middle range , where the differences are the largest , is also the region of the transition between the two kinematic components .",
    "the mixing of the components changes the measured @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 , but it should be also noted that the @xmath44q@xmath22@xmath45 varies over the whole map , becoming flatter and similar to @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 with radius .",
    "this is not the case in ngc4473 . here",
    "the photometric axial ratio remains constant , but the kinematic axial ratio changes at larger radii .",
    "again this change occurs in the transition region between the two kinematic components .",
    "detailed dynamical modelling of this galaxy shows that it is made of two counter - rotating stellar components of unequal mass .",
    "this object is physically similar to ngc4550 , where the main difference is in the mass fraction of the two components ( paper x ) . in the case of ngc4270",
    "it is the q@xmath22  that steadily changes with radius , while q@xmath16  has mostly high values , but shows abrupt changes between the points .",
    "these are related to sometimes rather high values of @xmath2 , which also changes abruptly between the adjacent points , a behaviour originating from the noisy transition region between two kinematic components .",
    "since it is hard to disentangle the noise from the genuine physical signal in q@xmath16   measurement , and given the boxy appearance on the large scales , we note that this object could be a true and unusual outlier from the relation between q@xmath22  and q@xmath16 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath74q@xmath22@xmath45 are either single component ( ngc821 and ngc4621 , if we exclude the crc in ngc4621 of @xmath75 in size ) or multi component ( ngc5838 ) .",
    "the hst image of ngc5838 has a prominent nuclear dust disk with the axial ratio between 0.3  0.4 , constraining its inclination to about @xmath76 .",
    "it is possible that the velocity map is dominated by the presence of an associated stellar disk embedded in the galaxy body . ngc821 and ngc4621 were parametrised via the multi - gaussian expansion in paper iv . both models required very flat gaussians to reconstruct the light distribution ( in both cases , the smallest axial ratios of the gaussians of the mge models were 0.3 ) ; these gaussians are tracing disks embedded in spheroids .",
    "if we compare the @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath45 with the flattest mge gaussians , both galaxies move well within the two vertical lines on right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ f : qkvqp ] ( blue lines ) .    as a matter of interest , on the same right hand plot of fig .",

    "its kdc has flatter kinematics than the light , but the flattest mge gaussian is comparable with the kinematic axial ratio .",
    "this suggest that even some of the sub - components of the slow rotating galaxies have similar properties like fast rotating galaxies .    having in mind that q@xmath16  profiles can vary significantly with the radius , and the average values",
    "could be contaminated by the contribution of the transition regions between the components , we conclude that there is a near one - to - one correlation between average kinematic and photometric axial ratios in fast rotating galaxies , with a number of objects having @xmath44q@xmath16@xmath77q@xmath22@xmath45 , and , hence , having disk - like components more visible in their kinematics than in photometry .      as shown in section  [ ss : prof ] ,",
    "the isophotes are not necessary a good representation of contours of constant velocity dispersion and the deviations are visible in the second cosine term ( @xmath26 ) of the harmonic decomposition of the velocity dispersion profiles extracted along the isophotes . on fig .",

    "focusing on the left hand panel , it is clear that galaxies in the sample span a large range of @xmath78 , both positive and negative .",

    "slow rotators are relatively round systems ( paper x ) with q@xmath22@xmath84 ( excluding the special case of ngc4550 ) .",
    "their @xmath83 values are small and mostly positive .",

    "[ f : b2a0 ] , let us go back to fig .",
    "[ f : diff ] and the example of ngc2549 and ngc4473 .",
    "their stellar velocity dispersion maps have different shapes from the distributions of light , but they have similar absolute values of @xmath78 ; they fall on the opposite sides of fig .",
    "[ f : b2a0 ] .",

    "ngc2549 shows clear photometric and kinematic evidence for a stellar disk viewed at a high inclination ( fig .",
    "[ f : vel_prof ] ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion map has a very specific bow - tie shape in the central 10 , while outside its amplitude is low everywhere .",
    "the bow - tie shape can be explained with a light - dominating dynamically cold stellar disk which decreases the observed velocity dispersion . outside of the disk , the bulge dominates and the observed velocity dispersion is again higher .",
    "it should be noted that the view of the galaxy at a high inclination is crucial for this effect to be seen .",

    "one of them is flat and counter - rotates with respect to the main galaxy body .",
    "this can explain the rise of the velocity dispersion along the major axis , specifically at larger radii where the contribution of the flat component becomes similar to the main body .",
    "this is also visible in the mean velocity map , where beyond 10  the velocity starts dropping .",
    "the only significant difference between these two examples is in the sense of rotation of the flat sub - components .",
    "co - rotating disks or flattened components , viewed at favourable angles will likely show negative @xmath87 , while counter - rotating components will contribute to positive @xmath88 .",

    "a similar case is ngc4550 , the most extreme outlier , which also has two counter - rotating disks . ngc4150 and ngc3032 can be put in the same group : the oasis measurements resolve their crc components .",

    "[ f : b2a0 ] , admittedly with small @xmath85 ( @xmath89 ) , indicating that the shapes of the velocity dispersion maps of @xmath15-drop objects are somewhat different from the shapes of galaxies with central plateaus in velocity dispersion profiles or bow - tie shape of velocity dispersion maps .",
    "the shapes of @xmath15-drops are more similar to the isophotes than the shape of iso-@xmath15 contours in the objects with strong near - to edge - on disks such as ngc2549 or ngc3377 . if @xmath15-drops , bow - ties and central plateaus are all caused by disks , than the difference between them might originate from the orientation of the galaxy , where bow - ties are seen at edge - on and @xmath15-drops at face on orientations .    given the uncertainties , it is hard to argue either way about other galaxies with slightly positive @xmath88 values .",
    "other effects , such as the actual size of the components or the presence of dust , may play a role on that level . this should be noted , but we , however , continue by suggesting that the main contributor to the shape difference between the zeroth and the second moment of the losvd in early - type galaxies are the embedded disks or flattened fast rotating components seen at different inclination . in this respect , on the right hand panel of fig .",

    "the final part of our analysis of the kinematic moments of the losvd is devoted to maps of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the gauss - hermite moments which measure deviations of the losvd from a pure gaussian .",

    "existence of @xmath93 distribution of points could be explained by the fact that , while @xcite plot only the points along the major axis , we plot them all , and the horizontal distribution and correlating tails are the consequence of the minor axis contamination . using kinemetry we extracted profiles of the dominant harmonic terms from @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath0 maps along the same best - fitting ellipses to the velocity maps maps along the best fitting ellipses for velocity maps , except in the case of the slow rotators when we used circles as explained in section  [ ss : prof ] .",

    "this result is similar to @xcite , in the sense that negative @xmath99 appear for larger @xmath95 , but we do not find as negative values of @xmath99 .",
    "the only slow rotator with negative @xmath100 , however , is the usual outlier , ngc4550 , the special case of two counter - rotating disks .",
    "radial profiles of kinemetric coefficients show that early - type galaxies are _ ( i ) _ multicomponent systems and _ ( ii ) _ in the majority of the cases contain a kinematic equivalent of a disk - like component .",
    "these statements are based on the empirical verification that the assumption of kinemetry holds .",
    "the assumption is that the azimuthal profiles , extracted from a velocity map along the best fitting ellipses , can be described with a simple cosine variation .",
    "practically , this means that higher - order harmonic terms are negligible and at our resolution we find that the deviation from the pure cosine law is less than 2% , for about 80% of cases , at least on a part of the map .",
    "the multiple components are visible in the abrupt and localised changes of kinemetric coefficients .",
    "the central regions often harbour separate kinematic components which co- or counter - rotate with respect to the outer body . in some cases there",
    "are more than two components ( e.g. ngc4382 ) or components are similar in size and co - spatial ( e.g. ngc4473 ) .",
    "although the axial ratio profile in edge - on systems can change with the seeing effects ( see appendix  [ s : psf ] ) , and in some cases the seeing can alter the map considerably , the kinematic sub - components are usually robust features .",
    "there are , however , early - type galaxies for which the deviations from the cosine law exceed 10% across a significant radial range .",
    "such objects are all classified as slow rotators in paper ix .",
    "the breakdown of the kinemetry assumptions is another evidence that these objects are intrinsically different .",
    "certainly , we might not be able to apply kinemetry _ a priori _ in its odd version on velocity maps that do not show odd parity ( e.g. ngc4486 ) , but in the case of slow rotators that show a detectable level of rotation ( e.g. ngc5982 ) , the kinemetric analysis clearly shows differences from the maps of fast rotators ( e.g. ngc4387 ) .",
    "there are three types of intrinsic structures that will show small mean velocities : _",
    "( i ) _ face - on disks , _",
    "( ii ) _ two counter - rotating equal in mass and co - spatial components and _ ( iii ) _ triaxial structures .    _",
    "( i ) face - on disks .",
    "_ low inclination thin disks will still have minimal deviations from the cosine law assumed in kinemetry .",
    "although the amplitude of the rotation in such cases is small , the disk - like rotation ( negligible @xmath2 coefficients ) is expected at all projections except in the actual case of @xmath101 with no rotation .",
    "such an example in the sample is ngc524 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "based only on the velocity map , one could naively interpret that ngc4486 is a thin disk at @xmath101 , given that it has q@xmath16@xmath103 and shows no rotation .",
    "however , other moments of the losvd strongly rule out this geometry , while , in general , other slow - rotators are not round enough to even be considered as such extreme cases .    _",
    "( ii ) counter - rotating components . _",
    "this case can be outlined with ngc4550 and ngc4473 .",
    "these galaxies are examples of axisymmetric objects with two counter - rotating and co - spatial components .",
    "the first one is classified as a slow rotator , while the other one is a fast rotator . in both cases , however , it is the mass fraction of the components that really decides what is observed . in the case of",
    "ngc4550 the masses are nearly equal and the luminosity weighted mean velocity is almost zero in the central region .",
    "ngc4550 is a product of a very specific formation process , but a clear example of how a superposition of two fast rotating components can imitate a slow rotator . in ngc4473 , on the other hand ,",
    "one component is more massive and dominates the light in the central @xmath104 , where the rotation is clearly disk like . outside this region , where the counter - rotating component starts to significantly contribute to the total light , the shape of the velocity map changes , the amplitude of the rotation drops and non - zero @xmath2 coefficients are necessary to describe stellar motions .    _",
    "( iii ) triaxial objects .",
    "_ observationally , these objects are marked by kinematic twists and kinematic misalignments , which are not present in axisymmetric galaxies . a strong restriction to the shape of the velocity maps of axisymmetric galaxies",
    "is that they should not have a radial variation of pa@xmath16  or a misalignment between kinematic and photometric position angles .",
    "this , however , is not the case for triaxial galaxies , where the change of position angle can be influenced by a true change of the angular momentum vector , by the orientation of the viewing angles or by the relative dominance of different orbital families @xcite .",
    "paper x found that , globally , kinematic misalignments are present only in slow rotating galaxies .",
    "locally , however , we find both kinematic misalignments and twists in some fast rotating objects as well , but they are mostly confined to central components or clearly related to bars ( e.g. ngc1023 ) or galaxies with shells ( e.g. ngc474 )",
    ".    we do not find strong kinematic twists typical of the extreme cases of maximum entropy models of triaxial galaxies projected at various viewing angles ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) for velocity maps of stckel triaxial models ) . given that our sample is not representative of the luminosity function of local early - type galaxies in the sense that it contains too many massive galaxies , which are also more likely to show extreme features on the velocity maps , it is remarkable that we find that only a few velocity maps are similar to those predicted .",
    "still , the observed velocity maps are divers ( e.g. the difference between the maps of slow and fast rotators ) and their complexity reflects the difference in their internal structure .",
    "the profiles of the relative change of the kinematic position angles from the first panel of fig .",
    "[ f : radp ] suggest that fast and slow rotators have genuinely different intrinsic shapes , fast rotators being mostly axisymmetric and slow rotators weakly triaxial .",

    "we suggest that the high values of this ratio in slow rotators , which is in practice caused by the noise in non - rotating velocity maps , has its origin in the internal orbital make up of these galaxies . weakly triaxial",
    "slow rotators contain box orbits , and competing contributions of different tube orbit families , as opposed to more axisymmetric fast rotators with short - axis tubes as the only major orbit family @xcite.this suggestion is also supported by the analysis of the orbital structure of collisionless merger remnants @xcite as well as by the kinemetric analysis of velocity maps of simulated binary disc merger remnants @xcite .",
    "kinematic sub - components with azimuthal profiles that can be fitted with a cosine law are described as having a _ disk - like rotation _ ( dr ) .",
    "this does not mean that they are actual disks .",
    "it just suggests that velocity profiles of early - type galaxies extracted along the best - fitting ellipse _",
    "resemble _ the velocity maps of thin disks in circular motion .",
    "the rate of occurrence of drs is , however , striking .",
    "there is no reason why this should be the case in early - type galaxies , which in principle as a class can have a triaxial symmetry and complex motion in different planes .",
    "as suggested above , the link between the kinemetry assumption and the structure of fast rotating galaxies has its origin in their internal structure .",
    "the results of the dynamical models in paper x reveal that fast rotators show evidence for a kinematically distinct flattened spheroidal component , suggesting that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain flattened components .",
    "in addition to these dynamically cold components , the stellar populations of fast rotators show evidence for different chemical components .",
    "@xcite find that all morphologically flat fast rotators have mgb line - strength distribution flatter than the isophotes , and associate it with the rotationally supported substructure , which features a higher metallicity and/or an increased mg / fe ratio as compared to the galaxy as a whole .",
    "these are some of the dynamical and chemical evidences for disk - like components in fast rotators .",
    "what is the kinemetric evidence ?",
    "as mentioned above , we find that velocity maps of fast rotators are mostly described by a simple cosine law , as are velocity maps of thin disks .",
    "we also find an almost one - to - one correspondence between the projected shape of the stellar distribution and the shape of the observed kinematic structure in fast rotating galaxies .",
    "the connection between the shape and the kinematics is supported by an assumption that rotation influences the shape of the object by flattening it and , for isotropic models , the rotation speed responsible for flattening of the shape is related to the shape of the stellar distribution as @xmath105 ( * ? ? ?",

    "the isotropic models we used were previously presented in appendix b of paper x , to which we refer the reader for more details .",
    "the main point of these jeans models is that we used as templates 6 galaxies , which represent some of the typical types from the sauron sample .",

    "the velocity map of the jeans model of ngc4621 , whose mge parametrisation has the flattest gaussian , has a flat component along the major axis , which becomes more prominent with increasing inclination , contributing to the radial variation and increasing q@xmath16  with respect to q@xmath22 .",

    "it seems reasonable to assume that while isotropic models can explain certain features of fast rotators , they can not describe them as a class of galaxies .",
    "it is the embedded flattened components , often visible only in the kinematics that are responsible for the observed differences between the models and the data .",

    "the effects of seeing on galaxy images in the regime of non - adaptive optic assisted observations are now well understood @xcite .",
    "they are specifically important in the nuclear regions where the instrumental effects and the atmospheric seeing redistribute photons sufficiently enough to change the intrinsic ellipticity or position angle and mask structures like concentrated stellar nuclei or double nuclei @xcite .",
    "specifically , luminosity profiles are affected more by the seeing when the ellipticity is low , while the ellipticity profiles are affected more when the ellipticity is high @xcite . in general",
    ", effects of seeing can be detected to quite large radii .",
    "it is natural to expect the redistribution of photons due to the seeing will also influence the two - dimensional shape ( maps ) of the higher moments of the losvd .",
    "specifically , for the first moment , the mean velocity , the obvious effect of larger seeing is a less steep rise of the velocity in the centre . additionally , one can expect an increased axial ratio ( rounder map ) , or in other words , a more open spider diagram in the central regions . except for these qualitative expectations",
    "there are no quantitative estimates of the influence of seeing on the shape of velocity maps .",
    "observations of the sauron sample were taken under a variety of atmospheric conditions , so before analysing the velocity maps , we tested the effects of different psfs .",
    "we constructed a number of model velocity maps using a @xcite potential which reasonably well approximates the density of real early - type galaxies .",
    "each model map was constructed from the hernquist circular velocity profile , projected at a certain inclination to imitate different axial ratios seen in the sample ( q@xmath16 ) , and weighted by the given hernquist surface brightness profiles .",
    "all models have the same scale length @xmath125 .",
    "the inclinations ranged from 20 to 75 degrees , where 0 and 90 degrees are face on and edge on viewing angles , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to velocity maps with axial ratios q@xmath16  in the range of 0.94 to 0.26 .",
    "although in the sauron sample there are near to edge on galaxies , their velocity maps do not resemble the limiting case of edge on disks ( q@xmath16=0 ) , being considerably less flat .",
    "the above range in axial ratios were used to match the values observed in the sauron sample .",
    "maps were then convolved with a gaussian kernel of different full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) , accounting also for the square pixels @xcite in such a way as to make the model maps similar to observations , especially in the central regions which remain unbinned .",
    "the range of fwhm was also matched to the measured seeing range of sauron observations ( paper iii ) .",
    "figure  [ f : maps_fwhm ] shows an example of model maps for axial ratio of 0.5 and seeing fwhms of @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we ran kinemetry on the convolved model velocity maps and extracted the same parameters as for the observed velocity maps : pa@xmath16 , q@xmath16 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 harmonics .",
    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : prof_fwhm ] and they suggest that :    * determination of the position angle is not influenced by the seeing ; * the influence of the seeing on the determined axial ratio is larger on maps with intrinsically smaller axial ratio . also , the bigger the seeing is , the rounder ( larger axial ratio ) is the observed map . *",
    "the influence of the seeing on the rotation curve ( @xmath21 term ) is larger on maps with intrinsically smaller axial ratios , where the bigger is the seeing , the lower is the maximum velocity .",
    "the position of maximum velocity is also pushed towards larger radii . *",
    "the influence of the seeing on the higher terms ( @xmath130 ) is negligible in most cases , except for intrinsically very flat maps , but even there the signal is of the order of 1% or less and is not detectable with the current accuracy .",
    "as expected , the seeing influences the axial ratio of velocity maps ( or , in other words , the opening of the iso - velocity contours ) , and the steepness of the rotation curve , both in the maximum values and the positions of these maxima .",
    "the largest effect is for maps with small axial ratio ( large opening angles ) , which can be understood as the consequence of the convolution , similar as in the case of photometry and high ellipticity . in terms of changing of the intrinsic values ,",
    "it is the axial ratio that is the most affected by seeing . at an intrinsic flattening of 0.77 , a bad seeing of @xmath69 , will increase the flattening by 0.1 .",
    "this effect rises to surprising 0.5 difference in measured flattening for an intrinsic flattening of 0.26 .",
    "this effect is milder for the maximum rotation velocity , where only for velocity maps with the smallest axial ratios and strongest seeings the difference between the intrinsic and seeing convolved values exceeds 10 km / s .",
    "another effect of seeing on the velocity maps is the change of position of the maximum axial ratio and the maximum rotational velocity with increasing seeing . in both cases",
    "the trend is clear : larger seeing fwhm causes displacement of the maximum ( q@xmath16  or @xmath21 ) towards larger radii .    in summary , seeing can strongly influence the appearance of the velocity maps , both in the shape , value and extent of the features .",
    "this is important for interpreting the structures on the maps and , especially , when looking for kinematic subcomponents .",
    "in this section we present the results of kinemetric analysis of sauron velocity maps ."

    "<S> we differentiate between slow and fast rotators using velocity maps only and find that fast rotating galaxies contain disks with a large range in mass fractions to the main body . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we find that the velocity maps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks , except in the transition regions between kinematic subcomponents . this deviation is measured with the kinemetric @xmath2 ratio , which is large and noisy in slow rotators and about 2% in fast rotators . in terms of e / s0 classification , this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components with disk - like kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that differences in @xmath2 values for the fast and slow rotators arise from their different intrinsic structure which is reflected on the velocity maps . for the majority of fast rotators , the kinematic axial ratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios , contrary to what is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations . </S>",
    "<S> the position angles of fast rotators are constant , while they vary abruptly in slow rotators . </S>",
    "<S> velocity dispersion maps of face - on galaxies have shapes similar to the distribution of light . </S>",
    "<S> velocity dispersion maps of the edge - on fast rotators and all slow rotators show differences which can only be partially explained with isotropic models and , in the case of fast rotators , often require additional cold components . </S>",

    "<S> fast rotators contain flattened components characterised by a disk - like rotation . </S>",
