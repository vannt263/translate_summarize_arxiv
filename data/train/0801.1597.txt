    "during the last few decades a large variety of so  called _ unconventional _ superconductors have been discovered , among these the superfluid phases of @xmath3he @xcite , the heavy fermion systems@xcite , the cuprates@xcite and the ruddlesden  popper system sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5@xcite .",
    "the unconventional pairing correlations in these systems manifest themselves on the one hand in an anisotropy of the pair potential or energy gap of less symmetry than the underlying band structure or in the occurrence of additional spontaneously broken symmetries besides the @xmath6 gauge symmetry . on the other hand",
    "their existence can be detected from the sensitivity of thermodynamic quantities like the transition temperature or the equilibrium energy gap to even small amounts of non  magnetic impurities .",
    "+ in an earlier publication @xcite , a simple two  fluid description for these unconventional superconductors was formulated , which emerges from the bcs theory in the long wavelength ( @xmath7 ) and stationary ( @xmath8 ) limit , sometimes also referred to as the _ local equilibrium_. as a result , even analytical results were obtained for the temperature dependence of the local reactive response functions of the normal component , the bogoliubov quasiparticles ( specific heat capacity , spin susceptibility ) and the condensate ( superfluid density , magnetic penetration depth ) . clearly , a comprehensive two  fluid description of superconductors should describe the more general situation beyond local equilibrium and should therefore contain the dissipative response of both the quasiparticle system and the condensate . a first step in this direction was the derivation of a general form of a certain class of quasiparticle transport parameters for unconventional superconductors in reference @xcite .",
    "the results for the impurity  limited transport of momentum ( shear viscosity ) and energy ( diffusive thermal conductivity ) were , however , discussed exclusively for the case of superfluid @xmath3he  b with silica aerogel forming the impurity system .",
    "moreover , the two aspects of response and transport traditionally appear as fairly remote aspects of the reactive and dissipative dynamics of a superconductor .",
    "+ therefore , this paper is devoted to a unified description of response and transport in superconductors . to be specific ,",
    "we limit our considerations to unconventional spin  singlet superconductors with @xmath0wave pairing correlations , in view of an applicability to hole ",
    "doped cuprate superconductors .",
    "we would furthermore like to concentrate on the electronic raman @xcite and stress tensor response .",
    "when treated in the long wavelength limit , the corresponding response functions can be shown to be separable into normal ( bogoliubov quasiparticles ) and superconducting ( pair condensate ) contributions , respectively , hence allowing for a two  fluid description at _ arbitrary _ quasiclassical frequencies in the homogeneous ( @xmath9 ) limit . while the dynamics of the condensate can be characterized by some pseudo  conservation laws governing the macroscopic phase of the order parameter ( reactive response ) , as well as by pair ",
    "breaking processes ( dissipative response ) , the system of bogoliubov quasiparticles shows purely relaxational behavior in the long wavelength limit . for a quantitative study of the latter behavior we consider impurity  limited transport , believed to dominate at low temperatures .",
    "collisions of the bqp with impurities are treated within the t ",
    "matrix approximation @xcite , which is limited here to s  wave scattering .",
    "the description thus allows one to treat the cases of weak scattering ( born limit , @xmath10 ) and strong scattering ( unitary limit @xmath11 ) on the same footing .",
    "the theory is applied to an analysis of the electronic raman response and the attenuation of ultrasound in @xmath0wave superconductors .",
    "our formulation is general enough to include the aspects of _ universal transport _ , which was discussed previously in the literature in context with electronic conductivity @xcite , diffusive thermal conductivity @xcite , ultrasound attenuation @xcite and electronic raman response @xcite . + the paper is organized as follows : after a discussion of the equilibrium properties of unconventional superconductors in section 2 , we establish a general response theory in section 3 which is based on the classification of external perturbation potentials through vertex functions @xmath12 , which correspond to the specific experiment , testing the response .",
    "section 4 then deals with the derivation of a two  fluid description of the response in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath9 ) at arbitrary quasiclassical frequencies @xmath13 .",
    "the effects of the long  range coulomb interaction are explicitly taken into account in the derivation of the response functions .",
    "results for the condensate response , which are known from the literature , are briefly rederived for completeness at the end of this section .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the response and relaxation properties of the system of thermal excitations of the superconductor , the bogoliubov quasiparticles ( bqp ) .",
    "it is shown that the dynamics of the macroscopic density fluctuations of the bqp system is entirely relaxational and describable by a set of macroscopic relaxation times , which depend on the vertex function @xmath12 .",
    "this concept allows for the derivation of quite general equations , which relate the response functions of the bqp system to the corresponding transport parameter of given vertex function @xmath14 .",
    "the influence of the long range coulomb interaction on the qualitative form of the transport parameter is studied . in section 6",
    "we consider the special case @xmath15 , i. e. the relaxtion of the macroscopic quasiparticle density in the absence of the coulomb renormalization and make contact to earlier work on intrinsic density relaxation and the second viscosity . in section 7",
    "we derive the explicit form of the impurity  limited relaxation time , which enters the transport parameters using the t ",
    "matrix approximation for the impurity self  energy . in sections 8 and 9",
    "we discuss the similarities in the temperature dependence of the transport parameters associated with electronic raman scattering and ultrasound attenuation for various parameters characterizing impurities in the weak ( born ) and strong ( unitary ) scattering limit .",
    "section 10 is finally devoted to our summary and conclusion .",
    "it is well established that the pairing correlations in cuprate superconductors are _",

    "in order to test the response and transport properties of a superconducting system , one has to apply external perturbation potentials , which can be classified in the following way : @xmath26\\delta u_{ij } = \\sum_a a_\\vk\\delta\\xi_a \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first and second term in ( 6 ) describe the coupling of the electronic system to the electromagnetic scalar ( @xmath27 ) and vector ( @xmath28 ) potential , respectively .",

    "the raman case , on the other hand , is characterized by a transport parameter which is reminiscent of the second viscosity , discussed in section 6 , generalized to include the square of the raman vertex in the fermi surface average : @xmath262 @xmath263 has the form @xmath264 hence we have demonstrated the physical similarity of the hydrodynamic transport parameters emerging from the electronic raman effect and the sound attenuation in @xmath0=2 .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated , how the response and transport properties of unconventional superconductors are linked together in a very simple way , if the long wavelength limit @xmath58 is taken . in this limit the contributions of the normal component ( the bqp system ) and the condensate ( the system of cooper pairs ) to the response and transport simply add up and allow for a two  fluid description which is valid at arbitrary quasiclassical frequencies .",
    "the result for the quasiparticle transport parameters @xmath145 and @xmath137 are qualitatively different before and after the renormalization of the response with respect to the long  range coulomb interaction .",
    "these transport parameters can be represented in a form , which is valid both in the limits of weak ( born ) and strong ( unitary ) scattering and which makes their dependence on temperature and the impurity scattering parameters ( @xmath265 ) particularly clear . in the low @xmath217 limit",
    ", the temperature dependence can be evaluated analytically and is found to differ from a simple power  law behavior , predicted earlier @xcite . in the limit of born scattering ,",
    "some components of the quasiparticle transport tensors stay constant in the low @xmath217 limit and thus exclude the possibility of weak scattering as a model for impurity limited transport for example in the cuprate superconductors . in the unitary limit ,",
    "on the other hand , we find offsets in the transport parameters , which , in certain cases , do not depend on the impurity scattering parameters .",
    "this so  called universal transport occurs in both the impurity  limited electronic raman effect and the attenuation of ultrasound .",
    "we could finally demonstrate , that for quasi2@xmath0 systems the raman scattering intensity is closely related to the transport of momentum ( stress tensor ) in the bqp system .",
    "in this appendix we would like to demonstrate that although one has to carefully distinguish the response of quasiparticle densities and currents ( their reactive response is indeed different ) their dissipative response , characterized by their transport parameters , is the same .",
    "this justifies the line of arguments presented in section 5 of this paper .",
    "we now give a more general derivation of response functions and transport parameters for a system of bogoliubov quasiparticles ( bqp ) in @xmath0wave superconductors .",
    "the dynamics of such a bqp system is governed by a scalar kinetic equation for the distribution function @xmath266 ( c. f. eq .",

    "it is important to decompose the bqp energy change @xmath272 into even and odd contibutions w. r. t. the operation @xmath113 : @xmath273\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( 79 ) the quantity @xmath274 denotes a generalized vector potential .",
    "note that in the case of the electromagnetic response ( @xmath275 ) one has @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "the macroscopic bqp density is defined through ( c. f. eq .",
    "( 21 ) in the text ) : @xmath278 using this definition , one may derive from ( 76 ) the following relaxation equation for @xmath279 : @xmath280 here we may identify the bqp current @xmath281 in the form @xmath282 in the case @xmath283 , the solution of the kinetic equation for the bqp density @xmath122 , discussed in the text , reads after invoking the effects of the long  range coulomb interaction ( c. f. eq .",

    "it is instructive to decompose the density response function @xmath291 into its real and imaginary parts , respectively : @xmath292 in the same way we obtain for @xmath293 : @xmath294 it is interesting to formally compare the response of the bqp density and current in the following way : the density response can be written in terms of an effective bqp relaxation time @xmath295 in the form ( c. f. eq .",
    "( 33 ) in the text ) : @xmath296 whereas the current obeys a drude  like law , involving a corresponding effective current relaxation time @xmath297 : @xmath298 eqs .",
    "( 88 ) and ( 89 ) are clearly seen to describe the formal difference between the density and current response : whereas the effective relaxation times for the densities and currents differ only by the use of different vertices @xmath299 , the response of the current is drude  like , whereas the response of the density is not .",
    "nevertheless we have now arrived at a stage where we can analyze the connection between the density and current response functions and the transport parameters associated with the densities and currents . defining generalized forces @xmath300 we may write @xmath301 an inspection of eqs .",
    "( 83 , 85 , 88 , 89 ) shows that while the reactive response of bqp densities and currents is qualitatively different , the dissipative response of densities and currents , represented by the transport parameters @xmath184 and @xmath302 is similar in structure , if on makes the replacements for the vertices @xmath303 .",
    "the transport parameters @xmath184 and @xmath302 read @xmath304 hence we have arrived at a unified description of transport phenomena associated with the raman and stress tensor response and have therefore justified the argumentation presented in section 5 .",
