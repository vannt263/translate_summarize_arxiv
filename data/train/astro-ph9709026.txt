    "the interstellar abundance of molecular oxygen has been a puzzle for a long time .",
    "since the cosmic abundance of oxygen ( o / h @xmath5 8.5 10@xmath6 ) is a little more than twice as large as that of carbon , at most half of oxygen could be locked up in co , the rest should be in the form of atomic oi , or in the molecules o@xmath1 , oh , h@xmath1o .",
    "the h@xmath1o / h@xmath1 ratio is predicted between 10@xmath7 and 10@xmath8 by chemical models , and such predictions are compatible with recent iso results ( e.g. cernicharo et al 1997 ) .",
    "since the abundance of oh is only 10@xmath9 or lower , it was long thought that o@xmath1 could be as abundant as co , i.e. 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath6 with respect to h@xmath1 or at least 1/10th of that of co ( langer et al 1984 , viala 1986 ) . in dark clouds , oi and o@xmath1 are predicted to have comparable abundances , while most of the oxygen should be atomic in diffuse clouds . to circumvent the atmospheric absorption ,",
    "the recent searches have used either the @xmath10o@xmath11o ( fuente et al 1993 , marchal et al 1997a ) or the redshifted o@xmath1 ( combes et al 1991 , liszt 1992 , combes & wiklind 1995 ) and have come up with an upper limit in the o@xmath1/co ratio of @xmath5 1.3 10@xmath12 at 1@xmath4 .",
    "we report about further efforts to detect an o@xmath1 line in absorption , using the redshifted molecular cloud at @xmath13 absorbing the continuum from the quasar b0218 + 357 ( cf combes & wiklind 1995 ) .",
    "the selected lines are at lower frequencies , where the continuum flux is larger , and should provide a better chance of detection .",
    "the observations around 70 ghz have been carried out at the nrao 12m telescope at kitt peak in february 1996 .",
    "the observations around 30 ghz have been obtained with the nrao 43 m telescope in green bank in february 1996 , and then at the 45 m nobeyama telescope in japan during several observing runs from february to may 1997 .",
    "two sis receivers ( 68 - 90 and 90 - 116 ghz ) were used at 70 ghz ( o@xmath1 ) , 87 ghz ( cs(32 ) ) and 105 ghz ( hcn(21 ) ) , with an average system temperature of 345 , 225 and 250 k respectively .",
    "the receivers were used in dual polarization modes , and tuned in single- sideband .",
    "the corresponding beam sizes are 98 , 79 , and 66 .",
    "the observations were done using the wobbler switching mode .",
    "we used simultaneously broad filterbanks ( 0.5 mhz resolution ) and narrow band autocorrelators ( hybrid spectrometer ) , providing a resolution of 97 khz .",
    "however the spectra were smoothed to gain signal - to - noise to velocity resolutions of 1 - 3 km / s .",
    "pointing was checked at least every two hours by broadband continuum observations of radio - sources ; the pointing accuracy was 6 rms .",
    "the receiver was a cooled hfet with a system temperature t@xmath14 = 120k , and a bandwidth of 500 mhz .",
    "the beam size is 56 at the cs and o@xmath1 frequencies .",
    "the conversion ratio was estimated at 10 jy / k .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency was strongly varying with the hour angle , up to a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "the efficiency was monitored through observations of strong continuum sources ( pointing sources ) such as 3c 274 , 3c 84 , and the pointing corrections were also obtained on saturn and jupiter .",
    "the observations were made by position switching .",
    "the autocorrelator backend provided a resolution of 19.5 khz , or 0.18 km / s at the o@xmath1 frequency .",
    "the receiver was a cooled hemt of bandwidth 2ghz and t@xmath14 140170k .",
    "the half - power beam width of the telescope is 59 and 51 at 29 and 33 ghz respectively .",
    "the aperture efficiency is 60% at 30 ghz , leading to a conversion ratio of 2.9 jy / k , for the antenna temperature t@xmath15 .",
    "the observing procedure was position switching .",
    "the was checked every one to two hours by observing a nearby sio maser star , s per , and its accuracy was better than 10 ( peak value ) .",
    "the 2048-chanels aos backends provide a resolution of 37 khz , i.e. 0.38km / s at the cs frequency and 0.33 ghz at the o@xmath1 one .",
    "the flux density of the continuum emission was measured with a continuum backend in beam - switching mode at 29 ghz and with aos at 33 ghz simultaneously with the o@xmath1 line .",
    "the bl lac object b0218 + 357 is remarkable by its radio images , that reveal two distinct flat - spectrum cores ( a and b component ) , with similar spectrum and polarization level , strongly suggesting a gravitational lens phenomenon ( patnaik et al 1995 ) . that a and b are gravitational images is confirmed by the presence of a small einstein ring surrounding the b image , of 335 milli - arcsecond in diameter ( patnaik et al 1993 ) .",
    "since the ring has a steeper spectrum , it is probably the image of a hot spot in the jet component , and its contribution in the millimetric domain should be negligible .",
    "the lensing galaxy at a redshift @xmath13 absorbs the radio continuum of the remote quasar in the hi line ( carilli et al 1993 ) , and in molecular lines ( wiklind & combes 1995 ) .",
    "the intensity ratio between the two images is a / b @xmath5 3 - 4 at several radio wavelengths ( odea et al .",
    "1992 , patnaik et al .",
    "1993 ) . as in the similar absorbing lens galaxy in front of pks1830211 ( cf wiklind & combes 1996 ) ,",
    "some of the main molecular lines are optically thick as attested by the detection of isotopomers , but the radio continuum is not totally absorbed , which means that the absorbing material does not cover the whole surface of the continuum source . in the case of pks1830211 , interferometric observations have confirmed that only one image of the source is covered by the absorbing cloud ( wiklind & combes 1997a ) . in b0218 + 357 , the situation is still unclear , although it has been claimed that only part of the a image is covered at cm wavelengths ( menten & reid 1996 ) and through optical imaging ( grundahl & hjorth 1995 ) .",
    "at the period of our observations , the fraction of the total continuum absorbed was determined to be one third .    to derive the optical depth of a given line , or at least an upper limit on the optical depth , we must know exactly the total continuum flux of the source at the epoch of observations , since it might be variable , and the surface filling factor of the absorption , i.e. the fraction of the continuum source surface covered by molecular clouds .",
    "the best is even to bypass these two steps , by observing another line at a neighbouring frequency , which is optically thick and gives directly the absorbed continuum level .",
    "this was done in our previous work , where the neighbouring co transition was shown to be highly optically thick through observations of @xmath16co and c@xmath11o ( combes & wiklind 1995 ) .    to calibrate the n , j = 1,1  1,0 118 ghz o@xmath1 line , redshifted at 70 ghz , we could not observe the 115 ghz co(10 ) line unfortunately , since the 12m receiver was not operating at 68 ghz .",
    "instead , the line cs(32 ) and hcn(21 ) were observed at redshifted frequencies of 87 and 105 ghz respectively .",
    "the hcn(21 ) profile is displayed in figure [ figo1 ] , normalized to the absorbed continuum .",
    "it can be compared with the analogous spectrum obtained with the iram telescope in july 1996 , also normalised to the continuum . both appear optically thick . from the millimetric observations carried out with the iram-30m telescope in 1994 , 1995 and 1996 , the total continuum does not seem to have varied , at least within the error bars ( 10 - 20% ) .",
    "the cs(32 ) was not detected with the 12m ( although it is detected with the iram-30m , wiklind & combes 1997b ) .    to calibrate the n , j = 1,1  1,2 56 ghz o@xmath1 line , redshifted at 33 ghz",
    ", we have observed the cs(10 ) line , redshifted at 29 ghz , together with the corresponding @xmath16cs line .",
    "the cs(10 ) line was detected both at nro and gb ( see figure [ figo1 ] ) , but are not saturated , and the @xmath16cs line was not detected , with an rms noise level of 4mk in channels of 4km / s ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we must therefore rely on the measurement of the total continuum , and on the assumption that the fraction of the surface covered by the molecular cloud is the same at 1 cm and 3 mm .    the total continuum level measured at the various frequencies and telescopes",
    "is displayed in figure [ figo2 ] , together with some other measurements in the literature ( see combes & wiklind 1997 for details ) . within the error bars ,",
    "all measurements follow a power - law distribution as a function of frequency . in february 1996 , the total continuum level measured at 30 ghz at green - bank was t@xmath15 = 70 @xmath17 10mk ( 0.7 jy ) , and in february 1997 it was 0.255 @xmath17 .017 k at 33 ghz and 0.245 @xmath17 .020 k at 29 ghz at nobeyama ( i.e. 0.74 and 0.71 jy ) in very good agreement .",
    "we have assumed thermal equilibrium ; this is justified since the absorbing molecular cloud is dense with a large optical depth , and the o@xmath1 lower levels are completely thermalised in these conditions ( see marchal et al 1997b ) . then , to estimate column densities , the usual formula can be used ( cf combes & wiklind 1995 ) , assuming gaussian line profiles , with the intrinsic line - width of 4.6 km / s .",
    "another possibility is to relax the hypothesis of steady - state chemistry , and consider time - dependent models ( prasad & huntress 1980 , graedel et al 1982 , langer et al 1984 ) : much more atomic carbon and oxygen exists at times well before steady - state , at so - called early - times , i.e. 1 - 3 10@xmath18 yrs . if steady - state has no time to establish , because of a short dynamical mixing time between the diffuse photodissociated phase and the dense dark phase , the relative abundance of o@xmath1 can be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude ( chize et pineau des forts 1989 ) .",
    "most of the oxygen would then be in atomic form , as supported by the recent detection of [ oi ] 63@xmath19 in absorption towards sgr b2 ( baluteau et al 1997 ) .",
    "also in the model of le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1995 ) molecular clouds reveal chemical bistability , and there may exist a high ionization phase of the ism with a very low oxygen abundance , where the o@xmath1/co ratio is lower by two orders of magnitude than in the low ionization phase .",
    "the interstellar abundance of molecular oxygen remains problematic ; balloon and satellite experiments are much needed .",
    "if confirmed , the present low upper limit for the o@xmath1/co ratio strongly constrains chemistry models .",
    "if a large fraction of the oxygen abundance is frozen onto grains we expect enhanced o@xmath1 and h@xmath1o abundances in regions of shocked molecular gas .",
    "we are very grateful to the green bank and kitt peak nrao engineers and operators for their particular care in receiver and band - rejection tunings .",
    "we also thank n. kuno for his continuum flux measurements at nro .",
