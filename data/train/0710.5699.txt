    "leptoquarks ( lqs ) appear in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "first discussed in the classic papers by pati & salam @xcite and georgi & glashow @xcite , lqs are a common ingredient to grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "they can also appear in composite @xcite as well as in technicolour models @xcite .",
    "also in supersymmetric models with r - parity violation scalar quarks have leptoquark - like interactions @xcite . from a low - energy point of view",
    ", however , lqs are best described in a `` model - independent '' way , using a lq lagrangian based only on the minimal assumptions of ( a ) renormalizability and ( b ) standard model ( sm ) gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive list of limits on such lqs from low - energy experiments can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "direct searches so far have not turned up any evidence for lqs @xcite .",
    "the best limits on pair produced lqs currently come from the d0 @xcite and cdf @xcite experiments at the tevatron .",
    "these typically give limits on lq masses in the ballpark of @xmath5 gev , depending mainly on the final state decay branching ratios and on the lepton - quark generation , to which the lq state couples .",
    "considerably more stringent limits are expected from the lhc experiments .",
    "depending on the accumulated luminosity , the lhc should be able to find lqs up to masses of order of @xmath6 tev @xcite .",
    "solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite and reactor @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have firmly established that neutrinos have mass and non - trivial mixing between different generations . in the sm neutrinos are massless . however ,",
    "non - zero neutrino masses can easily be generated and the literature is abound in neutrino mass models @xcite . certainly the most popular way to generate neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism @xcite , countless variants exist .",
    "however , it is also conceivable that the scale of lepton number violation is near - or at - the electro - weak scale . to mention a few examples ,",
    "there are supersymmetric models with violation of r - parity @xcite , models with higgs triplets @xcite or a combination of both @xcite .",
    "also purely radiative models have been discussed in the literature , both with neutrino masses at 1-loop @xcite or at 2-loop @xcite order .",
    "radiative mechanisms might be considered especially appealing , since they generate small neutrino masses automatically , essentially due to loop suppression factors .    in this paper , we study the generation of neutrino masses due to loops involving light leptoquarks , in a model with non - zero leptoquark - higgs interactions @xcite .",
    "lq - higgs interactions lead to mixing between lqs of different chiralities ( and lepton number ) once electro - weak symmetry is broken and thus can contribute non - trivially to the majorana neutrino mass matrix at 1-loop level .",
    "gev , their contribution to @xmath7 was deemed negligible . ] as discussed below , the peculiar structure of leptonic mixing , observed in neutrino oscillation experiments , enforces a number of constraints on the lq parameter space .",
    "the main result of our current work is , that these constraints can be used to make definite predictions for different decay branching ratios of several lq states .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis that lq loops are responsible for the generation of neutrino mass is testable at the lhc , if lqs have masses of the order of @xmath8 tev .    before proceeding",
    ", a few more comments on lqs might be in order .",
    "first , for the lq model to be able to explain neutrino data , non - zero lq - higgs interactions are essential .",
    "limits on these couplings , on the other hand , can be derived from low - energy data such as , for example , pion decay @xcite . especially stringent are limits from neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite and from the decay @xmath9 @xcite . however , as we will discuss below , the small neutrino masses themselves are up to now the most sensitive low - energy probe of lq - higgs mixing terms .",
    "second , it should be mentioned that lq loops as a source of neutrino mass have been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "we will improve upon this work in several aspects : ( i ) we will present neutrino mass formulas containing all possible lq loops , while in @xcite only down - type quark loops were considered . (",
    "ii ) @xcite concentrated on upper limits on lq parameters , which can potentially be derived from observed neutrino masses .",
    "we , on the other hand , identify the regions of lq parameters were the neutrino mass matrix is dominated by lq loops , thus providing a potential explanation of oscillation data . and ,",
    "lastly but most importantly , ( iii ) we discuss possible accelerator tests of the lq hypothesis of neutrino masses , to the best of our knowledge for the first time in the literature .",
    "finally , it should also be mentioned that lqs can be either scalar or vector particles .",
    "we consider only scalars in details .",
    "however , we note that most of our results straightforwardly apply also for vector lqs .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ sec : lqdefs ] ) we define the leptoquark interactions , both with quark - lepton pairs and with the sm higgs boson and discuss the lq mass matrices . in section ( [ sec : nuloops ] ) we calculate the 1-loop neutrino mass matrix in the lq model .",
    "some particularly simple and interesting limits are defined and discussed analytically .",
    "the typical ranges of lq parameters , required to explain current neutrino data , are explored .",
    "we then turn to the phenomenology of lqs at future accelerators in section ( [ sec : lqdecays ] ) .",
    "it is found that some fermionic lq decays trace the measured neutrino angles and thus can serve , in principle , as a test of the lq model .",
    "next we discuss lq decays to the sm higgs and to gauge bosons .",
    "higgs ( and @xmath10 ) decays should occur , if kinematically possible , due to the non - zero lq mixing required to explain neutrino masses and thus form a particularly interesting signal of the lq model .",
    "we then close the paper with a short summary .",
    "the sm symmetries allow five scalar lqs .",
    "table [ tab : lqcharges ] shows their @xmath11 quantum numbers , as well as their standard baryon and lepton number assignments .",
    "lqs which couple non - chirally are strongly constrained by low - energy data @xcite .",
    "thus , the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( as well as @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , which have the same sm quantum numbers , but couple to ( quark ) doublets and singlets , respectively , are usually assumed to be independent particles . under these assumptions ,",
    "the most general yukawa interactions ( lq - lepton - quark ) induced by the new scalar fields are given by @xcite @xmath16 here we used the conventions of @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lqlqint ] ) is written in one - generation notation .",
    "in general , all @xmath17 s are @xmath18 matrices in generation space . @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are the quark and lepton sm doublets ( singlets ) , @xmath24 are the scalar lqs with the weak isospin @xmath25 coupled to left - handed ( @xmath26 ) or right - handed ( @xmath27 ) quarks respectively .",
    "thus , in total eq .",
    "( [ eq : lqlqint ] ) contains seven lq fields .",
    "we have also defined @xmath28 .",
    ".standard model quantum numbers of the scalar leptoquarks .",

    "are described by the scalar potential @xcite @xmath31 here @xmath32 is a cumulative notation for all scalar lq fields with @xmath33 ( the same for @xmath34 ) .",
    "the diagonal mass terms @xmath35 can be generated by spontaneous breaking of the fundamental underlying symmetry down to the electroweak gauge group at some high - energy scale .",
    "the subsequent electroweak symmetry breaking produces non - diagonal lq mass terms which , in addition to the diagonal terms given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lqhiggsint ] ) , define the lq squared - mass matrices .",
    "these will be discussed next .",
    "it is important to note , that the first two terms of the scalar potential in eq .",

    "such terms , however , introduce violation of baryon number and , hence , proton decay , for details see @xcite",
    ". therefore we will not consider lq self - interaction terms here .",
    "] in the limit where @xmath37 and @xmath38 vanish , neutrino masses vanish as well .",
    "there are four squared - mass matrices which determine the masses of lqs with the same electric charge ( @xmath39 ) . in the interaction",

    "for lqs of charge @xmath61 we will diagonalize the mass matrices numerically below . however , the following approximate expressions are useful for an analytical estimate of parameters .",
    "the rotation matrices which relate the interaction and mass eigenstates can be parametrized by six rotation angles , namely , @xmath62 in the limit where the off - diagonal entries in the mass matrices eqs ( [ eq : q1/3lqmassm ] ) and ( [ eq : q2/3lqmassm ] ) are smaller than the difference between the corresponding diagonal ones , it is possible to find approximate expressions for the rotation angles also in this more complicated case . as discussed in the next section , for the neutrino masses the most relevant angles are @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for the angles in the @xmath66 case on can use eq .",

    "although eq.([eq : fgyub ] ) constrains a different combination of left- and right - lq couplings than eq.([eq : lambdaulb ] ) we conclude that , barring cases where some fine - tuned cancellation between different lq contributions occur , we expect that first generation quark loops can not explain current neutrino data .",

    "we will refer to this case , @xmath178 , as scenario i. @xmath63 , on the other hand , can be much smaller than the corresponding angles in the down - type loops in those parts of parameter space where all relevant off - diagonal entries in the lq mass matrices are small . in this case",

    "we have written only the partial widths to top and bottom quarks .",
    "formulas for the lighter generations can be found with straightforward replacements of indices .",
    "however , since the widths , eqs ( [ eq : br13 ] ) - ( [ eq : br53 ] ) , are not suppressed by quark masses , our assumption that 3rd generation quark loops give the dominant contribution to @xmath7 , can in principle be checked experimentally .",

    "note that if the mixing between different lqs is small , as is generally expected , the decays of some of the lq states @xmath203 are controlled by _ the same yukawa couplings that determine the non - trivial structure of the neutrino mass matrix_. this observation forms the basis of the different decay pattern predictions discussed below .",
    "however , one complication arises from the fact that we can not predict if the decays of the lightest or one of the heavier of the lq states is dictated by the yukawas fixed by neutrino physics .",

    "we now turn to @xmath182 final states . in general , in electro - weak symmetry breaking new mass terms for lqs , which are members of the same multiplet , could be generated by some non - sm scalars , potentially introducing large splitting _ within _ a given multiplet . in this case , lq decays to @xmath182 states could occur independent of lq mixing between _ different _ multiplets .",
    "then , since lq-@xmath182 decays are of order @xmath285 they would easily become dominant once kinematically allowed . in the current model , however , mass splitting of lqs within the same multiplet comes only from lq mixing , see eqs ( [ eq : q1/3lqmassm])-([eq : q5/3lqmassm ] ) .",

    "fermionic decays of ( some of the ) lq states trace the neutrino angles , i.e. certain ratios of decay branching ratios can be predicted from current neutrino data . in general",

    "one also expects a smaller number of events of the type @xmath291 ( and @xmath292 ) , although the details in this case are more involved , as discussed above .    in this context",
    "we would like to stress that one of the basic assumptions applied in practically all accelerator searches for lqs is that lqs couple only to one generation of leptons and quarks at a time .",
    "as discussed at length above , such completely generation diagonal couplings would _ exclude _ lq - loops as an explanation of neutrino oscillation data . extending the lq search to lepton flavour violating decays thus",
    "should be considered seriously by experimentalists .",
    "we have also discussed how , in some specific scenarios , much more detailed predictions can be made .",
    "given the observed hierarchy of standard model quark masses , it seems reasonable to assume that contributuins from 3rd generation quark loops dominate the neutrino mass matrix . for the case of top quark dominance ,",
    "our results are summarized in the figures ( [ fig : br_t23sq])- ( [ fig : brcom_mn2sqmn3sq ] ) .",
    "similar results hold in case of pure bottom - loop dominance .    finally , an important test of the hypothesis that lqs can generate majorana neutrino masses , is the search for decays of heavier lqs into lighter ones plus a standard model higgs or gauge boson .",
    "any observation of a non - zero branching ratio for the decay @xmath293 constitutes proof for lq mixing , which is the basic ingredient for the lq explanation of neutrino masses .",

    "<S> leptoquark - higgs interactions induce mixing between leptoquark states with different chiralities once the electro - weak symmetry is broken . in such lq models majorana neutrino masses are generated at 1-loop order . here </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the neutrino mass matrix and explore the constraints on the parameter space enforced by the assumption that lq - loops explain current neutrino oscillation data . </S>",
    "<S> lqs will be produced at the lhc , if their masses are at or below the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> since the fermionic decays of lqs are governed by the same yukawa couplings , which are responsible for the non - trivial neutrino mass matrix , several decay branching ratios of lq states can be predicted from measured neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> especially interesting is that large lepton flavour violating rates in muon and tau final states are expected . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the model predicts that , if kinematically possible , heavier lqs decay into lighter ones plus either a standard model higgs boson or a @xmath0 gauge boson . </S>",
    "<S> thus , experiments at the lhc might be able to exclude the lq mechanism as explanation of neutrino data .    </S>",
