    "gene regulatory networks are graphs that represent interactions between genes or proteins .",
    "they are the simplest way to conceptualize the complex physico - chemical mechanisms that transform genes into proteins and modulate their activity in space and time . in the network view , all these processes are projected in a static , purely topological picture , which is sometimes simple enough to explore quantitatively  @xcite . thanks to the systematic collection of many experimental results in databases , and to new large scale experimental and computational techniques that enable to sample these interactions , these graphs are now accessible to a significant extent .",
    "some examples are the undirected graphs of protein - protein interactions , and the directed graphs of transcription and metabolic networks  @xcite .",
    "the availability of such large - scale interaction data is extremely important for post - genomic biology , and has provided for the first time a whole - system overview on the global relationships among players in a living system .",
    "the hope is to study these graphs together with the available information on the genes and the physics / chemistry of their interactions to infer information on the architecture and evolution of living organisms . in this program ,",
    "the simplest possible approach to take is to study the topology of these networks .",
    "for instance , order parameters such as the connectivity and the clustering coefficient have been considered  @xcite .",
    "other investigators have focused on the relations of gene - regulatory graphs with other observables , such as spatial distribution of genes , genome evolution , and gene expression  @xcite    typically , in an investigation concerning a topological feature of a biological network , one generates so called `` randomized counterparts '' of the original data set as a null model . that is , random networks which conserve some topological observables of the original .",
    "the main biological question that underlies these studies asks to establish when and to what extent the observed biological topology , and thus loosely the living system , deviate from the `` typical case '' statistics . to answer this question , the tools from the statistical mechanics of complex systems are appropriate . for example , a topological feature that has lead to relevant findings is the occurrence of small subgraphs - or `` motifs ''  @xcite .",
    "the study presented here focuses on the topology , and in particular on the problem of evaluating and characterizing the feedback present in the network . on a generic biological standpoint",
    ", this is an important issue , as it is related to the states and the dynamics that a network can exhibit . roughly speaking",
    ", the existence of feedback in the network topology is a necessary condition for the dynamics of the network to show multistability and cycles  @xcite . in presence of feedback",
    ", the relations between internal variables play an important role , as opposed to situations where the network is tree - like , and the external conditions determine completely the configurations and the dynamics .",
    "recently , we came to similar conclusions analyzing the structure of the compatible gene expression patterns ( fixed points ) in a a boolean model of a transcription network  @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits a transition between a regime of simple gene control , and a regime of complex control , where the internal variables become relevant and dynamically non - trivial solutions are possible .",
    "these regimes correspond to the sat , and hard - sat phases of random - instance satisfiability problems . for random boolean functions ,",
    "the two regimes can be understood completely in terms of feedback in the network topology .",
    "a selection of the boolean functions can change this outcome  @xcite .    rather than dealing with specific experimental networks ,",
    "this is meant as a theoretical study on a model graph ensemble  .",
    "our purpose here is twofold .",
    "first , to introduce some `` order parameters '' , i.e. functions that describe the relevant feedback properties , connected to algorithms that can be used to evaluate the feedback without enumerating the cycles .",
    "second , to study an ensemble of random graphs , or randomization technique , with structured adjacency matrices , that conserve the number of entries in their diagonal .",
    "this choice , which we will justify , leads to a distinct behavior .",
    "the two problems are introduced in section [ sec : prob ] .",
    "we show the connections between different points of view on the problem , using simple algebraic , graph theoretical , and statistical mechanical tools .",
    "the first approach is an application of a decimation algorithm called `` leaf - removal ''  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm links the feedback to the existence of a percolating `` core '' in the network , containing cycles .",
    "the numbers of core variables and edges can then be used as order parameters for the feedback . here , we formulate three variants of the leaf - removal algorithm , and discuss the statistical meaning and the relations between them and different levels of feedback .",
    "namely , for an oriented graph , one can use these algorithms to define and distinguish `` simple '' from `` complex '' feedback .",
    "furthermore , we discuss how one can connect feedback to the satisfiability - like optimization problem of counting the solutions of a random linear system on the galois field gf2  @xcite .",
    "this can also be seen as a linear algebra problem concerning the kernel and rank of the connectivity matrix . the theoretical motivation for the choice of an ensemble with structured diagonal will follow naturally from this discussion . in section",
    "[ sec : res ] we present our main results , as a series of `` phase diagrams '' , which describe the typical feedback of random realizations of the graphs . in the unstructured case , the phase diagrams obtained by leaf - removal show the existence of five regimes , or `` phases '' , characterizing the feedback in the limit of infinite graph size .",
    "some of these regimes are connected to complexity transitions for the associated random gf2 optimization problem .",
    "moreover , we show that the choice of a structured diagonal leads to a quantitatively different behavior , and thus to a significantly different amount of feedback in the graph .",
    "these differences are greatly enhanced if the degree distribution is scale - free .",
    "the problem we want to address consists in evaluating the feedback in a random ensemble of graphs .",
    "while the range of application is more general , to avoid excess of ambiguity we choose a specific ensemble of graphs that will be treated in detail throughout the paper .",
    "we consider oriented graphs , where each node has @xmath0 incoming links .",
    "the graph ensemble can be specified through a @xmath1 boolean matrix @xmath2 ( having elements @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xmath2 represents the input - output relationships in the network . if @xmath5 are network nodes , @xmath6 if @xmath7 , and zero otherwise . the matrix is rectangular because only @xmath8 nodes have an input . we allow for self links , or diagonal elements . for",
    "a simple directed graph one can say that feedback exists as soon as closed paths of directed edges emerge . having in mind the fact that , while here we consider only topological properties , the incoming links are `` inputs '' , that is , they encode for some conditions on the nodes ( for example , on gene expression ) , we can also use a separate graphical representation for the nodes , or `` variables '' , and the `` functions '' regulating these variables .",
    "this representation is a bipartite graph ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nodes ] ) .",
    "each graph has @xmath9 variables and @xmath10 functions , and thus on average @xmath11 functions per variable .    .",

    "@xmath12 is a function and @xmath5 are variables , @xmath13 is the output.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    an important point concerning randomization , is that the choice of what feature to conserve and what not to conserve in the randomized counterpart is quite delicate and depends on specific considerations on the system . in the words of statistical mechanics , the typical case scenario can vary greatly with the choice of the ensemble . for instance , the network motifs shown by randomizing a network with an erdos - renyi random graph differ from the usual ones , for which the degree sequence is used as a topological invariant  @xcite . in studies of biological networks , the diagonal of @xmath2",
    "is normally disregarded , or assumed to have the same probability distribution as a row or a column . the use of considering it is a matter of the nature of the graph and the property under exam . for the case of transcription networks ,",
    "an ensemble with structured diagonal might have some relevance .",
    "for example , for motifs discovery , sometimes one puts the diagonal to zero , and considers degree - conserving randomizations that do not involve the diagonal  @xcite . in our earlier work on transcription networks ,",
    "we have considered the autoregulators as a structured diagonal  @xcite .",
    "we will show , for our model graph ensemble , that this leads to considerably different results for the feedback .",
    "there are other biological examples where a structured adjacency matrix emerges naturally .",
    "the simplest example are mixed interaction graphs .",
    "for instance , one can consider a composition of a transcription network with a protein - interaction network ( which is a non directed graph ) and pose the question of evaluating the feedback on a global scale compared to randomized counterparts .",

    "however , this is in general computationally as costly as enumerating all the paths .",
    "for this reason , it is desirable to use algorithms and order parameters that allow a quicker evaluation . to this aim",
    ", we describe three variants of a decimation algorithm , termed `` leaf - removal '' , that is able to remove the tree - like parts of the graph , leaving the components with feedback .",
    "we define a leaf as a variable having only incoming links , and a `` free '' variable , or a root , a variable having only outgoing links ( fig  [ fig : cores ] ) .",
    "@xmath14 is a measure for the fraction of regulated variables , as opposed to external variables which only enter functions as inputs .",

    "lrc works naturally on directed and undirected bipartite graphs .",
    "in fact , viewing the system as a bipartite graph , one can verify that lrc is equivalent to removing all the functions connected to a single node , ignoring directionality .",

    "the leaf - removal algorithms enable to analyze these different forms of feedback , that can be `` weaker '' than the complex cycles and hypercycles that are relevant for the associated gf2 problem .",

    "let us try to visualize the leaf - removal procedure , for instance lrc , on a generic adjacency matrix .",
    "consider a general boolean matrix @xmath30 @xmath106 , and apply lrc .",
    "each time we find a leaf , we assign it and its corresponding constraint a progressive number , and we use that number as a label for the rows . with these permutations ,",
    "we construct a hierarchy for the leaves , as the leaves of layer @xmath107 can not appear in the clauses of layer @xmath108 . in the tree - like case ,",
    "reordering the lines of @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the set of first layer leaves , @xmath111 the second , etc .",
    "the last @xmath112 entries of each row correspond to free variables .",
    "we have thus obtained a triangulation of @xmath30 , where the diagonal is made of blocks ( the layers ) of identity matrices .    in the presence of a core",
    ", the triangulation can be carried only until a the core is reached , and the the matrix can be rearranged to show the core in the lower right corner . if the core has hypercycles , in the unsat phase , the matrix structure is @xmath113 here , @xmath114 , so typically it will not possible to find solutions to the core linear system on gf2 , or the core does not contain sufficient free variables . when the ensemble for @xmath30 is specified , one has to apply this procedure to all the realizations . naturally , the outcome depends on the matrix ensemble .",
    "it also depends in general on the variant of leaf - removal that one applies .",
    "focusing on the diagonal of @xmath30 , we note that in presence of hypercycles , one has necessarily to have some zeros in the @xmath115 submatrix of @xmath30 to realize the condition @xmath116 .",
    "this can be seen in the sketch above , where the diagonal elements are followed by an exclamation mark . in particular , the diagonal contains an extensive number of ones .",
    "thus , following the above argument , it is easy to realize that @xmath117 , and the hypercycle phase may exists only marginally at @xmath43 . for our main choice of ensemble , this is the case , as each variable can have only one input , so each constraint can always be labeled by the name of its output variable , which will appear as a one in the diagonal of @xmath30 . in the case where the diagonal contains an extensive number of zeros ,",
    "the situation is quite different , and the hypercycle phase can appear for @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "we present here the analytical calculation for lra .",
    "if @xmath118 is the probability to have @xmath46 outputs , lra defines a dynamics for it , associated by the cancellations of leaves at each time step . for every time @xmath119 ,",
    "one can write @xmath120 the fraction of nonempty columns is given by the probability @xmath121 .",
    "writing the increments as , @xmath122 , one can choose @xmath123 , @xmath124 $ ] , and obtain intensive equations of the kind @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the matrix that represents the flux generated by a move  @xcite .",
    "we now separate @xmath30 in the blocks @xmath83 and @xmath127 of constrained and free variables respectively , writing @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "the variables that appear in @xmath127 have an outgoing edge but no incoming ones .",
    "@xmath83 has @xmath129 columns , while @xmath127 has @xmath130 columns .",
    "all the rows of @xmath30 have @xmath0 ones .",
    "the distribution for the ones appearing in the columns , i.e. for the outdegree @xmath46 , is poisson for both @xmath83 and @xmath127 , @xmath131 , with @xmath132 . we impose @xmath133 .",
    "the lines of @xmath30 contain on average @xmath134 elements in @xmath83 and @xmath135 elements in @xmath127 , thus after one move there are on average @xmath136 elements in @xmath83 . defining @xmath137 .",
    "the flux equations can be written as @xmath138 ;   \\quad \\mathrm{for~ } k>1 \\vspace{0.1 cm } \\\\",
    "\\frac{df^s_1}{dt } = -1 + \\frac{p'-1}{<k>^s(t)-1}[f^s_{2 } ] \\ \\ , \\\\",
    "\\vspace{0.1 cm }      \\frac{df^s_0}{dt } = 1 \\ \\ ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath139 . summing the above equations , one obtains the evolution equation for the normalization factor @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath141 with initial condition @xmath142 , the solution is @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath144 can then be identified with @xmath145 appearing in the ( poisson ) distribution @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 , from which @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath149 , @xmath150 for @xmath151 , one can then write @xmath152 , so that @xmath153 the stop time @xmath154 of the algorithm is then a solution of the equation @xmath155 .",
    "this last equation implies that if @xmath156 the lowest solution for the stop - time is @xmath157 , or , in other words , all the graph is removed . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath158 , there is a finite stop time @xmath159 , and thus a core .",
    "this determines the critical value @xmath73 .",
    "the size of the portion of the core matrix contained in @xmath83 is given by @xmath160 .    in order to evaluate the full core matrix and the order parameters",
    ", the same analysis has to be carried out for the matrix of the free variables , @xmath127 . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath161 , where @xmath162 .",

    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the last equation can be rewritten as @xmath165 $ ] .",
    "as above , summation yields the evolution of the normalization constant @xmath166 .      in conclusion ,",
    "the stop time @xmath154 is a function of @xmath170 , determined by the relation @xmath171 .",
    "the transition value to an extensive core is then given by @xmath172 .",
