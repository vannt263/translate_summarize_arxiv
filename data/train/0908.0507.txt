    "in recent years , a wide variety of small-@xmath2 and hard diffractive processes which are under intense study experimentally has been used to improve our knowledge about quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "an outstanding process is the diffractive heavy quarkonium production , where their large masses provide a natural hard scale that allows the application of perturbative qcd .",
    "there are several mechanisms proposed for the quarkonium production in hadron colliders @xcite , as the color singlet model , the color octet model and the color evaporation model .",
    "an important feature of these perturbative qcd models is that the cross section for quarkonium production is expressed in terms of the product of two gluon densities at large energies . in a similar way ,",
    "the diffractive quarkonium production is also sensitive to the gluon content of the pomeron at small-@xmath2 and may be particularly useful in studying the different mechanisms for quarkonium production . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the heavy quarkonium production is of special significance because they have an extremely clean signature through their leptonic decay modes .",
    "as long diffractive processes are concerned , in hadron collisions they are well described , with respect to the overall cross - sections , by regge theory in terms of the exchange of a pomeron with vacuum quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the pomeron and its reaction mechanisms are not completely known .",
    "a good channel is the use of hard scattering to resolve the quark and gluon content in the pomeron @xcite .",
    "such a parton structure is natural in a modern qcd approach to the strongly interacting pomeron .",
    "the systematic observations of diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) at hera have increased the knowledge about the qcd pomeron , providing us with the diffractive distributions of singlet quarks and gluons in pomeron as well as the diffractive structure function @xcite . in hadronic collisions",
    ", we shall characterize an event as single diffractive if one of the colliding hadrons emits a pomeron that scatters off the other hadron .",
    "hard diffractive events with a large momentum transfer are also characterized by the absence of hadronic energy in certain angular regions of the final state phase space ( rapidity gaps ) .",
    "the events fulfilling the conditions of large rapidity gaps and a highly excited hadron remnant are named single diffractive in contrast to those in which both colliding hadrons remain intact as they each emit a pomeron . the so called central diffractive events .    here , we focus on the following single diffractive processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the lhc energies and predict their diffractive ratios as a function of transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) of quarkonium state . such processes are interesting because the produced large @xmath5 quarkonia are relatively easy to detect through their leptonic decay modes and their transverse momenta are balanced by the associated high energy photon .",
    "as we will verify , the ratio of single diffractive production cross section to the inclusive production cross section is not strongly sensitive to the heavy quarkonium production mechanism .",
    "this channel has been recently investigated in the context of heavy ion collisions @xcite and it can also to be compared to the previous calculations on diffractive quarkonium production @xcite .",
    "we start by the hard diffractive factorization , where the diffractive cross section is the convolution of diffractive parton distribution functions and the corresponding diffractive coefficient functions in similar way as the inclusive case",
    ". however , at high energies there are important contributions from unitarization effects to the single - pomeron exchange cross section .",
    "these absorptive or unitarity corrections cause the suppression of any large rapidity gap process , except elastic scattering . in the black disk limit",
    "the absorptive corrections may completely terminate those processes .",
    "this partially occurs in ( anti)proton  proton collisions , where unitarity is nearly saturated at small impact parameters @xcite .",
    "the multi - pomeron contributions depends , in general , on the particular hard process and it is called survival probability factor . at the tevatron energy , @xmath6  tev ,",
    "the suppression for single diffractive processes is of order 0.050.2  @xcite , whereas for lhc energy , @xmath7 tev , the suppression appears to be 0.060.1  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these corrections are quite important for the reliability of predictions for hard diffractive processes .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we summarize the main formulas considered to compute the diffractive ratios for the hadroproduction of @xmath8 final state at the lhc energy . in the last section we present the numerical results for the inclusive e diffractive cross sections as a function of transverse momentum at the central rapidity region and give predictions for the corresponding diffractive ratios .",
    "we discuss in details the theoretical uncertainties involved in the present estimations and also compare them with previous calculations in the literature .",
    "let us introduce the main formulas for the inclusive and single diffractive differential cross sections for the production of @xmath9 state in proton - proton collisions at high energies .",
    "for the inclusive case , we will rely on the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism and for the diffractive process the calculation are based on the ingelman - schlein ( is ) model for diffractive hard scattering @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we will take into account absorption effects by multiplying the diffractive cross section by a gap survival probability factor .",
    "concerning inclusive production , as long as @xmath10 is produced at small longitudinal momentum fraction , the gluon fusion channel dominates over the @xmath11 annihilation process .",
    "the corresponding signal is the production of a @xmath12 and an isolated photon produced back - to - back , with their transverse momenta balanced .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) cross section is obtained by convoluting the partonic cross section with the parton distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath13 , in the proton , where @xmath14 is the factorization scale . at nlo expansion on @xmath15 ,",
