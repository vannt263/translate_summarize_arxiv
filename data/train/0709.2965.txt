    "in recent years , many cosmological observations suggest that the universe is flat and its expansion is accelerating@xcite . the most common explanation for the question of the origin of such an acceleration is to assume the existence of unknown dark energy component .",
    "a dynamical model , which relates a dark energy scalar with neutrinos , so called mass varying neutrinos ( mavans ) scenario , was proposed as a candidate for the dark energy@xcite . in the context of this scenario",
    "there are a lot of works@xcite . among these works ,",
    "we consider a mavans model in the supersymmetric theory .",
    "the mavans scenario assumes an unknown scalar field so called `` acceleron '' and a sterile neutrino .",
    "they are gauge singlets under the gauge group of the standard model . in the extension of the scenario to the supersymmetry ,",
    "these fields are embedded into chiral multiplets@xcite .",
    "typical time evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in ref.@xcite , where the acceleron and a sterile neutrino are embedded into the single chiral multiplet . in this model ,",
    "the observed dark energy density is identified with the false vacuum energy and the dark energy scale of order @xmath0 is understood by gravitationally suppressed supersymmetry breaking scale , @xmath1 .",
    "these works are based on assumptions that the imaginary part of the acceleron and vacuum expectation values of sneutrinos vanish .    in this paper , we present a modified supersymmetric mavans model of ref.@xcite and detailed analyses of the vacuum structure of the scalar potential taking account of the finite imaginary part of the acceleron . since the vanishing imaginary part of the acceleron should be dynamically realized , discussions based on the assumption in ref.@xcite are inadequate to analyse the vacuum structure of the potential .",
    "actually , we find the global minimum is different from one in the case of the vanishing imaginary part of the acceleron . the dark energy is identified with the false vacuum energy and the dark energy scale is given by @xmath2 in ref.@xcite .",
    "we show that the identification and the observed dark energy scale are also realized in the modified model where the acceleron is appropriately stabilized .",
    "furthermore , we present cosmological discussions for the magnitude of the yukawa coupling among the acceleron and sterile neutrinos which is assumed to be of order one in ref.@xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the model with non - vanishing vacuum expectation values of sneutrinos are also discussed .",
    "we find that the magnitude of vevs of sneutrinos are strictly constrained in the supersymmetric mavans model .",
    "then , two body decay processes of the superparticles are also studied .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present a supersymmetric mavans model and detailed analyses of the vacuum structure of the scalar potential with finite imaginary part of the acceleron and vanishing vevs of sneutrinos . in section 3",

    "the section 5 is devoted to the summary .",
    "let us discuss vacuum structure in a supersymmetric mass varying neutrinos model .",

    "the scalar component corresponds to the acceleron which causes the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "the spinor component is a sterile neutrino .",
    "coupling constants and mass parameters are represented by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "are allowed but contributions from these interactions to the acceleron potential and neutrino masses are negligibly small .",
    "the terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 1 ] ) are important to realize the mavans scenario . in this model",
    ", there is no assignment to conserve the r - parity due to the emergence of trilinear coupling . in the limit of @xmath22 , a dark energy sector composed of @xmath7",
    "is decoupled from the mssm ( visible ) sector and then r - parity conservation is restored as in the mssm .",
    "the lsp is absolutely stable in the case of conserved r - parity , however some decays of sparticles into the acceleron and a sterile neutrino are generally allowed in the model given by eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "taking supersymmetry breaking effects into account , the scalar potential for the acceleron is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are supersymmetry breaking parameters and @xmath26 is a constant determined by imposing the condition that the cosmological constant is vanishing at the true minimum of the acceleron potential .    in the mass",
    "varying neutrinos scenario , the dark energy is supposed to be composed of the neutrinos and the scalar potential for the acceleron : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the energy densities of the dark energy and the neutrinos , respectively . for convenience",
    "later , we rewrite the scalar potential ( [ 2 ] ) in terms of two real scalar fields @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) instead of @xmath8 , @xmath32 where we define as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "first we discuss the vacuum structure of this scalar potential in the case of the vanishing vacuum expectation values of sneutrinos , @xmath35 if @xmath36 , the scalar potential has a local minimum at the origin in field space .",
    "moreover , when parameters satisfy a relation , @xmath37 the potential has a second local minimum at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which is lower than the local minimum at the origin , @xmath41 .",
    "then , @xmath40 is given as follows : @xmath42 in a region of @xmath43 @xmath44 has non - vanishing vevs , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the potential energy of the local minimum in this region , @xmath47 , is given by @xmath48 since @xmath47 is smaller than @xmath40 in the case of @xmath49 , @xmath47 is the value of global minimum of this scalar potential .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath50    )",
    ". there are four local minima , the first one is the origin in field space , @xmath41 , the second one is situated at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the remaining two local minima are degenerated and global ones , @xmath47 . ]    in summary , there are four local minima in the scalar potential ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "they are shown in fig.[fig : pot ] .",
    "the first one is the origin in field space and the second one is situated at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining two local minima are degenerated and global ones of the scalar potential , @xmath51 where @xmath52 we find that a constant @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , which cancels the cosmological constant , is tuned such as @xmath53 .",
    "now , let us consider a possible mass varying neutrinos model with this scalar potential .",
    "since the dark energy in the mavans scenario is the sum of the scalar potential and the energy density of neutrinos , the stationary condition is given by @xmath54 we find the local minimum at the origin is slightly deviated due to the contribution of the neutrino energy density .",
    "and a numerical calculation shows that the model works near the origin in field space : @xmath55 ev and @xmath56 ev , where superscript zero means the value at the present epoch . since @xmath8 field is trapped in the local minimum near the origin , one observes the potential energy @xmath57 as the dark energy at the present epoch .",
    "the @xmath8 field trapped near the origin is plausible because it is likely that the universe starts at the origin due to the thermal effects .",
    "typical values of parameters are given as @xmath58 by numerical calculation when we take @xmath59 as inputs masses and couplings .",
    "now , we assume that supersymmetry is broken at tev scale in a hidden sector and its effects are transmitted to a dark energy sector , which includes a chiral superfield @xmath7 , only through gravitational interaction .",
    "then , the scale of soft terms of order ( tev)@xmath60-@xmath61 is expected .",
    "soft parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are three - scalars couplings such as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if the dark energy sector is communicated with the visible sector , which includes the right - handed sneutrino , only through the gravitational interaction except for a peculiar yukawa interaction of the mavans scenario such as @xmath66 , @xmath67 are roughly estimated of order @xmath68 by dimensional analysis , where @xmath69 means the scale of soft terms in the visible sector .",
    "the magnitude of soft parameters in the visible sector depends on a mediation mechanism between the visible and a hidden sector .",
    "if we take @xmath70 , the magnitude of @xmath67 becomes @xmath71 .",
    "a larger scale of @xmath67 , which corresponds to @xmath69 , prefers tiny or vanishing vevs of sneutrinos in the mavans model .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 affects on the neutrino masses .",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath72 in the basis of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath9 are the left - handed and a sterile neutrino , respectively .",
    "the @xmath75 in the @xmath76 element of this matrix corresponds to the usual term given by the seesaw mechanism in the absence of the acceleron , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is assumed .",
    "the parameters @xmath79 are functions of @xmath80 , which are suppressed by large scales such as the right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath13 or the higgsino mass @xmath81 .",
    "if the vev of @xmath80 and the mixing between the active and a sterile neutrino are small , the mass of a sterile neutrino is almost determined by @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the magnitude of a sterile neutrino mass is the same order as the left - handed neutrino one , @xmath82 ev , and notice @xmath83 ev as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 determines the mixing between the active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "when we take as @xmath84ev , the mixing angle , @xmath85 , is expected . the active and sterile neutrinos mix maximally in the case of @xmath86ev @xmath87 , which is ruled out by the current astrophysical , cosmological and laboratory bounds . since @xmath14 is defined as @xmath88 in our model , @xmath14 @xmath86ev and @xmath89 gev require @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "in general , mavans models need such a tiny yukawa coupling among the left - handed neutrino , the higgs boson and the sterile neutrino . in the limit of @xmath22 ,",
    "a dark energy sector is decoupled from the visible sector and the mixing between the left - handed and sterile neutrinos vanishes .",
    "such a small yukawa coupling may be explained in a brane model however the discussion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we use the value @xmath84ev , which corresponds to @xmath92 , in numerical analyses .    in the mavans scenario ,",
    "the mass of the scalar field should be less than @xmath93 in order that the scalar field does not vary significantly on distance of inter - neutrino spacing , @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath95ev is taken in our calculation .    next , we comment on couplings @xmath96 .",
    "the size of @xmath97 is constrained by the successful big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) theory and supernova data . in the early universe ,",
    "the acceleron and the sterile neutrino have to decouple in order that the scenario of bbn is not radically changed .",
    "if the acceleron production rates through acceleron - strahlung and pair annihilation of neutrinos are less than the expansion rate at the era of bbn , these particles are not in thermal equilibrium at the epoch@xcite .",
    "these considerations give us @xmath98 eqs .",
