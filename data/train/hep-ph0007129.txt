    "the electroweak standard model ( sm ) , together with the theory of strong interactions ( quantum chromodynamics , qcd ) , provides a comprehensive description of experimental data with remarkable consistency . in order to further test the validity of the sm predictions and restrict its only missing parameter , the higgs boson mass",
    ", precision measurements play a key role .",
    "the analysis of precision observables is sensitive to quantum corrections in the theoretical predictions , which depend on all the parameters of the model . in this way",
    ", the top - quark mass , @xmath3 , had been predicted in the region where it was experimentally found .",
    "the constraints on the higgs mass , @xmath4 , are still rather weak since @xmath4 appears only logarithmically in the leading order sm predictions .",
    "therefore it is of high interest to further reduce experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "an important quantity in this context is the quantum correction @xmath0 in the relation of the gauge boson masses @xmath5 with the fermi constant @xmath6 and the fine structure constant @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this relation is established in terms of the muon decay width , which was first described in the fermi model as a four - fermion interaction @xmath8 with coupling @xmath6 .",
    "this yields for the muon decay width @xmath9 where @xmath10 subsumes effects of the electron mass on the final - state phase space and @xmath11 denotes the qed corrections in the fermi model . including two - loop qed corrections @xcite one obtains from the measurement of the muon decay width @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "the decay process in the sm , on the other side , involves the exchange of a w boson and additional electroweak higher order corrections . although not part of the fermi model , tree - level w propagator effects are conventionally included in eq .",
    "( [ gfdef ] ) by means of a factor @xmath13 .",
    "yet , this is of no numerical significance .",
    "the relation between the fermi constant @xmath6 and the sm parameters is expressed as @xmath14 here the sm radiative corrections are included in @xmath0 ( with @xmath15 ) .",
    "since @xmath6 is known with high accuracy it can be taken as an input parameter in equation ( [ drdef ] ) in order to obtain a prediction for the w mass ( @xmath16 is still afflicted with a considerable experimental error , @xmath17 gev @xcite ) : @xmath18 \\hspace{-.5ex}. \\label{mwpred}\\ ] ] since @xmath0 itself depends on @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ mwpred ] ) is to be understood as an implicit expression .",
    "one expects substantial improvement on the w mass determination from future colliders , which will allow for increasingly stringent constraints on the sm from the comparison of the prediction with the experimental value for @xmath16 .",
    "this requires an accurate theoretical determination of the quantity @xmath0 .",
    "the one - loop result @xcite can be split into the following contributions : @xmath19 dominant corrections arise from the shift in the fine - structure constant , @xmath20 , due to large logarithms of light - fermion masses ( @xmath21 ) , and from the leading contribution @xmath22 to the @xmath23 parameter resulting from the top / bottom doublet , which enters through @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the full @xmath4dependence is contained in the remainder @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .    furthermore , qcd corrections of @xmath28 ) @xcite and @xmath29 ) @xcite are known .",
    "leading electroweak fermionic @xmath2 contributions were first taken into account by means of resummation relations @xcite .",
    "different approaches for the calculation of electroweak two - loop corrections have been pursued , involving expansions for large values of @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it turned out that both the leading @xmath30 @xcite and the next - to - leading @xmath31 @xcite coefficients in the @xmath3 expansion yield important corrections of comparable size .",
    "therefore a complete two - loop calculation of fermionic contributions would be desirable in order to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty , in particular if one considers that these contributions are dominant already in the one - loop result .",
    "a first step into this direction was the determination of the exact higgs mass dependence of the fermionic @xmath2 corrections to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recently the full calculation of these contributions @xcite has been accomplished .",
    "the results include all electroweak two - loop diagrams with one or two fermion loops without any expansion in @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "this talk gives an overview on the techniques and the results of this calculation .",
    "since in the present calculation all possibly infrared divergent photonic corrections are already contained in the definition ( [ gfdef ] ) of the fermi constant @xmath6 and mass singularities are absorbed in the running of the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath16 represents the scale for the electroweak corrections in @xmath32 .",
    "therefore it is possible to neglect all fermion masses except the top quark mass and the momenta of the external leptons so that the muon decay diagrams reduce to vacuum diagrams .",
    "all qed contributions to the fermi model have to be excluded in the computation of @xmath0 as they are separated off in the definition of @xmath6 , see eq .",

    "for the experimental determination of the gauge boson masses , however , a breit - wigner ansatz with a running width is used .",
    "this has to be accounted for by a shift of the values for the complex pole masses @xcite , @xmath56 which yields the relations @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 the experimental numbers are taken . the w mass is a calculated quantity , and therefore also a theoretical value for the w boson width should be applied here .",

    "accordingly , one can either introduce the gauge - fixing term after renormalization or renormalize the gauge parameters in such a way that they compensate the renormalization of the fields and masses .",
    "both methods ensure that no counterterms arise from the gauge - fixing sector but they differ in the treatment of the ghost lagrangian , which is given by the variation of the functionals @xmath70 under infinitesimal gauge transformations @xmath71 , @xmath72 in the latter case , which was applied in this work , additional counterterm contributions for the ghost sector arise from the gauge parameter renormalization .",

    "[ fig : ccvert ] ) .",
    "one finds that for the difference terms between both schemes this loop can be evaluated in four dimensions without further difficulties .",

    "when applied to the calculation of one - loop triangle diagrams the results immediately respect all st identities and differ from the hvbm results only by terms of @xmath80 , @xmath81 since for the difference terms the second loop can be evaluated in four dimensions , this also holds for the two - loop cc diagrams , @xmath82    thus the mixed scheme , despite being mathematically inconsistent , can serve as a technically easy prescription for the correct calculation of the cc two - loop contributions .",
