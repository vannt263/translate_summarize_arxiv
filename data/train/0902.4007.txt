    "the persistent x - ray source cygnus x-3 was discovered 40 years ago and is one of brightest and most extensively studied x - ray binary ( xrb ) systems .",
    "it is however a peculiar source that still eludes simple classification .",
    "it is a close binary with an orbital period of 4.8 hours @xcite .",
    "the identification of the donor as a wolf - rayet star @xcite classifies it as a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "the strong wind from the wolf - rayet companion , surrounding the entire system makes radial velocity measurements difficult and the masses of the components are therefore uncertain .",
    "recent studies based on the luminosity at the observed state transitions suggest that the accretor is a @xmath5 black hole @xcite .",
    "this would make similar to the two other wolf - rayet x - ray binaries discovered so far , ic 10 x-1 @xcite and ngc 300 x-1 @xcite , where at least one of them , ic 10 x-1 , contains a black hole of mass 2334@xmath6",
    ".      displays five distinct spectral states @xcite , similar to those of the xrb transients ( itself is however a persistent source ) , but with the hardest state peaking at much lower energies .",
    "the presence of strong absorption has made it difficult to interpret the intrinsic spectral shapes and whether they represent true state transitions or are merely an effect of variable local absorption .",
    "@xcite , however , presented several strong arguments that the transitions indeed correspond to an intrinsic change in the accretion geometry , and in @xcite _ rxte _ data from all spectral states were consistently modelled . in this paper",
    "we use the nomenclature of @xcite to describe the states as the hard , intermediate , very high , soft non - thermal and ultrasoft ( see figs .  1 and 7 in @xcite for spectral shapes and envisaged accretion geometries ) in order of increasing softness .",
    "the very high , soft non - thermal and ultrasoft states will for most of the time be combined and referred to as the `` soft state '' or states as they differ mainly in the shape and strength of the high - energy tail .",
    "the x - ray temporal properties of are not as well studied as those of for example cyg  x-1 .",
    "the strong orbital modulation with a period of 4.8h was discovered in 1972 @xcite . in a study of the short time variability using _ exosat _ data , @xcite reported transient quasi - periodic features in the lightcurves during the soft states , and possibly also in the hard state .",
    "the periods for these features were in the 501500s range , with a given feature surviving for 540 periods .",
    "similar results were reported by @xcite , who found a transient oscillation with a @xmath7s period .",
    "a power density spectrum ( pds ) of was presented by @xcite , covering the frequency range @xmath8@xmath9hz .",
    "it was found that it was well described by a power - law of index @xmath10 , with a flattening at lower frequencies .",
    "a strong component was seen from the orbital modulation .",
    "no variability signal was detected above 0.1hz .",
    "a more detailed study of the x - ray variability above 1hz by @xcite found an upper limit of 12% rms on the variability in this range .",
    "recently , @xcite presented results from analysing _",
    "rxte_/pca observations of , including corrections for the binary variations .",
    "they compare observations made at three different times , and find that the pds does not change significantly ; above @xmath11hz it can be fitted by a power - law with index @xmath12 . using _",
    "rxte_/asm data , they find that the power - spectrum on longer time - scales ( @xmath13 day ) is flatter , and through extrapolation predict a break around @xmath11hz .",
    "in this paper we study the pds of in the range @xmath0 hz using _",
    "rxte_/pca , _ rxte_/asm and _ exosat _ data . based on the spectral analysis of @xcite",
    "we look for systematic differences in the pds between the different states .",
    "we also study the long - term variability and the full broad - band pds between the shortest and longest time - scales available .",
    "the data and methods used are described in sect .  2 , and the results are presented in sect .",
    "is followed by a discussion in sect .  4 , and in sect .  5",
    "we summarise our conclusions .",
    "the bulk of our data is from the all - sky monitor ( asm , * ? ? ? * ) and proportional counter array ( pca , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instruments onboard the _ rxte _ satellite .",
    "the _ rxte_/asm provides continual coverage of the x - ray sky in the 212kev range .",
    "a given source will be observed several times each day , and the data is available either in dwell - by - dwell format , or one - day averages .",
    "the _ rxte_/pca is used for pointed observations , typically lasting up to about an hour .",
    "the pointing data in this paper is the same as in @xcite , and that spectral analysis is used when determining the state of the source .    to create the pds ,",
    "pca lightcurves were extracted with 100ms resolution in the 29kev band .",
    "the lightcurves were then separated in intervals of 4096 bins , and a pds was computed for each interval . only intervals without gaps were retained , and the resulting pds were then averaged to form the final power spectrum . since the data stem from many different observations with varying setup , the proportional counter units ( pcus ) in use vary between observations .",
    "all lightcurves have therefore been normalized to one pcu .    to bridge the gap in frequency coverage between the pca and asm datasets ,",
    "we have also included data from the _ exosat_/medium energy ( me ) instrument @xcite .",
    "the data comprise the 19 observations of made with _ exosat _ spanning more than 9ks ( in total 22 observations were made of between 1983 and 1985 , see @xcite for a log ) . due to gaps in the data",
    ", these observations were divided into 26 segments , spanning between 3000 and 27750s .",
    "the data cover the energy range 0.88.9 kev .",
    "included in this dataset is the long ( 106ks ) observation analysed by @xcite .",
    "x - ray lightcurves of show strong modulation at the 4.8 hour orbital period .",
    "we have corrected all pca , asm dwell - by - dwell and _ exosat _ lightcurves for this modulation by dividing fluxes with a modulation template , taken from @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the template was fitted to the data with phases given by the ephemeris in @xcite .",
    "a problem with interpreting asm data is dealing with systematic effects .",
    "the data show variations with periodic components on time - scales matching one year , one day and one orbit .",
    "these periods are related both to variations in the observing conditions and in the instrument properties .",
    "although correction factors are applied when producing the asm lightcurve data , it is not possible to completely eliminate these effects . as a result , some systematic effects will still remain ; however , for a bright source such as , these systematics are only present on a low level for long time - scales ( @xmath14% ; a. levine 2008 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .      although the observations made by the _",
    "rxte_/asm are combined into one - day averages , they are not evenly sampled . a given source will be observed several times per day , in principle allowing variability on shorter time - scales to be detected by analysing the dwell - by - dwell data . in the case of cyg",
    "x-3 it also allows us to correct the data for the orbital modulation .",
    "rxte_/asm data was split up into different states , based on the flux level .",
    "small pieces of data in - between the defined states were not used .",
    "the data for each state was then divided into segments with lengths between 250 and 1000 points .",
    "power density spectra were computed with a lomb - scargle algorithm , normalized to variance per intensity squared and frequency unit .",
    "a logarithmically averaged pds was computed and a power - law fitted to the frequency range @xmath15@xmath16hz .",
    "the systematic effects on the pds caused by the data sampling were investigated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "synthetic data sets , with the same time sampling as the observations were produced and analysed in the same way .",
    "the simulated lightcurves were produced by shot noise . by injecting exponential shots with different distributions in decay times",
    "we simulated lightcurves for which the pds were power - laws with index ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the difference between the simulated and measured power - law index allowed us to estimate the systematic errors introduced by the data sampling .",
    "using _ rxte_/pca data , we have conducted a systematic study of the high frequency pds of .",
    "figure  [ pcapds ] shows example pds for all states seen in the source as defined by @xcite .",
    "the pds is in all cases well described by a steep power - law up to @xmath20 hz . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the signal is too weak to be detected .    .",
    "the flattening at high frequencies is due to the poisson level not having been subtracted.,width=302 ]    in order to test for systematic differences , we fit each pds to determine the power - law index . rather than subtract the poisson level , we include it in the model as a constant .",
    "an example fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ pcafit ] .",
    "the resulting indices are then grouped according to state .",
    "this allows us to compare the variations within each state to that between states .",
    "table [ indextable ] lists results and uncertainties for each state , obtained by combining all individual fits for that state . as the number of observations in each state varies , the rightmost column gives the number of pds combined in each state .",
    "we see that the index in all states is close to @xmath18 .",
    "however , there appears to be a tendency for the power - law in the hard state pds to be slightly less steep . in this state",
    "we also noted that there were larger fluctuations between the individual observations .",
    "the results are consistent with the index being the same in all the soft states .    .fitted power - law indices in the pds of all states .",
    "the data are from _",
    "rxte_/pca , and the frequency range is @xmath210.1 hz . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in many xrb sources , the power spectrum at high frequencies changes with the spectral state of the source . as shown by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) studies of the pds complement spectral analysis , and may in some cases provide a clearer indication of state than the spectral energy distribution . unlike other x - ray binary sources , for exmple cyg  x-1 ,",
    "the pds of do not show large variations between different spectral states .",
    "the pds in the different soft states are indistinguishable from each other and the only possible difference we may see is a slight tendency for a less steep power - law in the hard state .    the case for a true state transition in would be considerably strengthened had quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) been detected in the hard state pds , as in other sources , but we see no evidence of such features ( nor of any transient oscillations , as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the high - mass black hole binary cyg  x-1",
    ", these features dominate the hard state pds above @xmath22hz , with the lowest frequency feature peaking at 0.11 hz . in this range",
    "the pds of is however below the poisson level which would prevent such features from being detected .",
    "although the origin of the qpo features is not yet understood , many models predict an inverse scaling with mass ( i.e. , a scaling with the keplerian frequency , see for example * ? ? ?",
    "a generally accepted model for the accretion flow around the compact object is a two - phase flow , with an outer cool thin disc that is truncated at some radius and replaced by a hot inner flow .",
    "the truncation radius is determined by the mass accretion rate  at high accretion rates the thin disc may extend in to the innermost stable orbit ( for a thorough review of the model , see * ? ? ?",
    "this model provides a natural candidate for a specific radius where the frequencies are realised : the truncation radius .",
    "the low - frequency feature can be estimated using the viscous time - scale ( the longest time - scale ) at the truncation radius , giving @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the truncation radius in units of gravitational radii and @xmath25 the black hole mass in solar masses .",
    "@xcite concluded that for the transition to a hard state in to occur at the same eddington luminosity as in other non - transient sources , the mass of the compact object must be @xmath26 , three times that of cyg  x-1 . scaling up the low frequency component in the pds of cyg  x-1 for this mass",
    ", we would expect this component to appear at @xmath27 hz . in this range , it _ could _ be visible if it is there .",
    "however , the exact truncation radius and blackbody temperature in are poorly known due to both absorption and emission features in the wind that affects the spectrum strongly at low energies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to the best - fit models of @xcite the disc in the hard state of is truncated further in than in the hard state of cyg  x-1 .",
    "it is therefore likely that the component would show up in the higher end of the frequency range , which is again close to where the variability drops below the poisson level . in conclusion ,",
    "the non - detection of any qpo features in the hard state pds of neither confirms nor argues against a true state transition in the source .",
    "continuing the comparison with other xrbs , it is clear that the power - law in is quite steep - the most common value in other sources is an index close to @xmath17 ( at least in the soft states where the power - law dominates ; see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "an interesting question is therefore what process could give rise to this pds . as the system is enshrouded in heavy stellar wind , it is tempting to explain the pds as the result of scattering in this medium .",
    "such a scenario would predict that frequencies above the random walk time - scale are suppressed in the pds , much like the higher frequencies in .",
    "the explanation was suggested by @xcite to explain the weak or missing high - frequency variability in .",
    "if the wind optical depth does not vary much between the states of the source , this could also explain the more or less constant appearance of the pds .",
    "this scenario requires the wolf - rayet wind to be optically thick to scattering . the typical scattering time - scale for a spherical homogeneous scattering cloud of radius @xmath28 and optical depth",
    "@xmath29 is @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 index seen in the pds of the pca data continues to @xmath11hz .",
    "associating the break at @xmath11hz with the scattering time - scale and assuming a radius of the dense wind region of @xmath32 cm ( an estimate based on ir observations ; @xcite ) , would however require an unrealistic optical depth of @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite modelled the wolf - rayet wind including absorption and emission features .",
    "they find an average @xmath34 .",
    "this value gives a scattering time - scale of the order of only a few seconds for a radius of @xmath32 cm , or requires a radius of @xmath35r@xmath36 to explain the break in the pds .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that the low electron temperature in the hard state of may be a result of compton down - scattering in an optically thick wind , either from the wolf - rayet star or in the form of a disc wind / outflow ( this effect was however not included in the modelling of the x - ray spectrum ) .",
    "such a wind would have to have an optical depth of @xmath3735 to down - scatter typical 100 kev photons to the observed 20 kev peak .",
    "however even such a dense wind would still have to be extremely large , @xmath38r@xmath36 .",
    "thus , while scattering in a nearby surrounding medium may explain the lack of high - frequency variability ( @xmath39 hz ) as suggested by @xcite , the @xmath31 index of the pds can not be attributed to random walk in the wolf - rayet wind or any local scattering medium .",
    "allowing for a very large size of the scattering cloud does not solve the problem .",
    "although a large scattering halo has been detected around and the time delay from scattered x - rays used to determine the distance to the source @xcite , this is the result of scattering in interstellar dust .",
    "the optical depth in this medium is thus @xmath40 , and the halo is not a sign of the source being extended .",
    "however , an extended feature has been found around the system @xcite . it does not surround the entire source , and",
    "has been interpreted as a localized remnant of earlier outflows .",
    "recently , the feature has been shown to display flux and phase correlations with , making such an interpretation less likely @xcite .",
    "a possibility is that the feature is the result of a small scattering cloud within 2 kpc of , and can therefore not explain the high - frequency power spectrum .",
    "our results thus rule out the steep power - law as being due to scattering effects in a wolf - rayet wind , disc wind , local or line of sight matter , with any reasonable physical parameters .",
    "the pds of many xrbs are well described by a power - law at low frequencies . in a survey of low - mass xrbs",
    ", @xcite found that most of the studied systems displayed a power spectrum with index close to @xmath41 at low frequencies .",
    "the physical origin of this variability is however not yet determined .",
    "a commonly adopted framework is that of @xcite , where disturbances in the outer region of the disc propagate inwards .",
    "faster variations thus get superposed on slower variations , and the emergent power spectrum will have the shape of a power - law . a physical model based on this scenario",
    "was proposed by @xcite , and @xcite showed that a two - phase model ( cool disc and hot flow ) could successfully fit the broadband pds of cyg  x-1 and cyg  x-2 .",
    "the models predict a break in the frequency spectrum at time - scales corresponding to the longest variations , and a flat ( white noise ) pds below this .",
    "@xcite associate the longest time - scales in the accretion disc with the viscous time - scale at its outer boundary .",
    "we do not detect any break or flattening at the lowest end of our frequency range , that could be associated with an outer disc radius . on long time - scales ,",
    "it is clear that the variability introduced by the state transitions dominates the power spectrum , making such a feature hard to detect in the pds of the complete asm lightcurve ( cf .",
    "fig  [ statepds ] ) if the disc is larger than half the orbital separation .",
    "since is a wind - accreting system , it is likely that the disc significantly smaller .",
    "a feature in the pds connected to the outer edge of the disc could still be present at higher frequencies .",
    "this possibility will be discussed in the next section .",
    "even if dominant at our lowest frequencies , it is clear that the power from the transitions alone does not explain the pds at higher frequencies , showing that we are seeing intrinsic variability from the x - ray emitting region .",
    "the pds above @xmath42hz can be explained within the framework presented above , with disturbances in the accretion disc propagating inwards and ultimately modulating the x - ray flux .",
    "if the steep power law at high frequencies is not due to any scattering effect , it means that the pds is intrinsically steep . in the model of @xcite",
    "a power - law index of @xmath43 arises if perturbations in the disc are similar at all radii .",
    "if the perturbations are greater at large radii , the resulting power spectral index is steeper .",
    "this can be coupled to the disc being thickened at large radii , as proposed for the suggested accretion geometries in @xcite .",
    "our results further show that the probability of a state transition in is not dependent on the amount of time since the previous transition .",
    "this is contrary to what one might expect for transient systems , where an outburst consumes a large fraction of the accretion disc .",
    "the time - scale of an outburst is therefore dependent on the amount of matter in the disc , which should correlate with the time spent in quiescence , when the disc is built up .",
    "the state transitions in thereby seem more directly coupled to the mass loss rate of the companion star .",
    "this means that the viscous time - scale for a reconfiguration of the accretion flow as a response to a change in the accretion rate is shorter than the typical time - scale for variations in the mass - loss rate of the companion ( or capture rate of the compact object ) .",
    "although the break around @xmath11 hz seen in the _ exosat _ pds is not formally significant , the fact that it is consistent with the intersection of the power - laws from the ( high - frequency ) pca and ( low - frequency ) asm power spectra speaks in favour of the break being real .",
    "the same feature was seen in the results of @xcite , who analysed a single long _ exosat _ observation .",
    "the orbital modulation has been compensated for in both our analysis and that of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the break is quite close to the time - scale of the orbital period which is slightly suspicious .",
    "we note that the demodulation in all cases had a negligible influence on the pds below @xmath44hz , so the main uncertainty is not the existence of a break , but its precise location .",
    "if the break is interpreted as the feature connected with the viscous time - scale at the outer edge of the disc , this would mean a very small accretion disc .",
    "the corresponding radius is approximately @xmath45 , which is unreasonably small , and this interpretation can therefore be ruled out .",
    "it is interesting to further compare our results to the analysis of low - mass xrbs presented by @xcite .",
    "they found that all compact systems in their study showed a feature in the pds close to the orbital frequency .",
    "these systems also have low mass ratios , .",
    "@xcite argued that for low mass ratios , it is possible to excite a 3:1 resonance in the disc .",
    "the resonance occurs if the angular frequency of the orbital motion of a particle in the disc is commensurate with the angular frequency of the orbital motion of the secondary and will lead to asymmetry of the disc and a possible feature in the pds . for systems with a higher mass ratio ,",
    "the disc is tidally truncated before reaching the resonance radius .    tying the break at @xmath11hz observed in with the 3:1 resonance indicates that the mass ratio in this system is low , @xmath46 .",
    "although the mass of the companion wolf - rayet star is poorly known , it is expected to be @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giving a black hole mass of @xmath5 .",
    "this value is in agreement with that suggested by @xcite .",
    "we have conducted a systematic analysis of the pds of over the frequency range @xmath481 hz . for the first time",
    ", we compare the pds in all states of the source .    on short time - scales ,",
    "we confirm previous results that the pds is well described by a power - law with index close to @xmath18 . by comparing the variations within each state to that between states , we find that only the hard state index shows a tendency to deviate from this value",
    ". we do not find any evidence of qpo features in the pds , but this neither confirms nor contradicts the presence of a truncated disc in the hard state .",
    "our conclusion is that the pds is not a good indicator of state in .    on longer time - scales",
    "we find that the variability is dominated by the state transitions : the pds below @xmath3 hz can be completely explained by this pattern .",
    "we also find that there is no correlation between the probability for a state transition and the length of time spent in the state , suggesting a direct feedback between mass - capture rate and spectral state .",
    "combining datasets , we were able to create a power spectrum covering the entire @xmath420.1hz range , and found evidence for a break in the pds around @xmath11hz .",
    "this may be interpreted as evidence for the existence of a tidal resonance in the accretion disc around the compact object .",
