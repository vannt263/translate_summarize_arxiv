    "the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath12cdm ) paradigm predicts that small scale structure has developed by accretion and mergers within the large scale structure generated by primordial mass fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the galaxies tracing this structure are themselves embedded and have evolved in the dark matter halos ( white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "the halo properties such as abundance , distribution and density profile depend on the mass of halo ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) . as a result",
    ", the formation and evolution of galaxies is affected by the halo mass ( eke et al .",
    "2004 ; baugh 2006 ) .",
    "therefore the clustering properties of galaxies can be related to the distribution of dark matter halos , and hence offer an important insight into the relationship between the halo and the galaxies within it .",
    "for instance , wake et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used correlation functions and halo models to demonstrate that luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are frequently located in the centre of the most massive dark matter haloes , and that changes in their small scale clustering with redshifts can constraint lrg - lrg merger rates . at higher redshifts ,",
    "mo & white ( 2002 ) pointed out that halos of given mass are expected to be more clustered from simulations .",
    "observationally foucaud et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have demonstrated that galaxies with higher stellar masses are more clustered , and galaxies with a fixed stellar mass are also more clustered at higher redshift .",
    "hartley et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have also shown that passive , red galaxies are more clustered than star - forming , blue galaxies of similar absolute magnitudes at 0.5@xmath133.0 .",
    "quadri et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that a double power law was required to describe the correlation function of drgs at @xmath14 , but were unable to fit their clustering measurement and space density simultaneously using the halo model .",
    "tinker , wechsler & zheng ( 2010 ) showed that using a more realistic halo model they could better fit this clustering measurement , but they still required that the observed region be more clustered part of the universe than is typical .",
    "however , most observational studies of clustering and the halo model have concentrated on relatively low redshifts ( @xmath15 ) so their evolution has been poorly constrained . with the advent of large near - infrared surveys",
    ", it is now possible to apply these techniques to more distant galaxies .",
    "the study of the angular clustering of @xmath11 galaxies is particularly powerful as the near constant angular diameter distance in the @xmath1 range means that angle and comoving distance are much more closely linked than at lower redshift .",
    "therefore , any characteristic distance ( halo transition or sound horizon at last recombination ) will translate to a small range in angle .",
    "many colour criteria have been used to select high redshift galaxies .",
    "one of the crudest but most direct methods is to select galaxies with a large colour difference between optical and infrared wavelengths ( @xmath16 ) ( elston et al .",
    "1988 ) to select extremely red objects ( eros ) .",
    "this technique preferentially selects the most massive galaxies at @xmath11 which tend to be dominated by an evolved stellar population with a pronounced 4000@xmath17 break .",
    "however , the spectra of eros show evidence for a significant population of dusty , star - forming galaxies ( pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ; smail et al . 2002 ; roche et al .",

    "alternatively , a large near - ir colour difference , @xmath18 , can be used to select distant red galaxy ( drgs ) ( franx et al .",

    ", this simple colour cut selects galaxies with a range of redshift ( lane et al .",
    "2007 ; quadri et al .",
    "2007 ) and both dusty star - forming and passive galaxies ( labb et al . 2005 ; papovich et al . 2006 ) .",
    "drgs are also highly clustered ( grazian et al .",
    "2006 ; foucaud et al .",
    "perhaps the most striking evidence for clustering of high redshift galaxies is the angular clustering of _ herschel _ spire sources presented in cooray et al .",
    "( 2010 ) where the large scale clustering and its distinct curvature are unambiguously detected for @xmath11 fir selected galaxies that are presumably the progenitors of present day massive , early - type galaxies from the similarity of their clustering properties .",
    "the addition of a third photometric datapoint can improve the discrimination of high redshift galaxy selection .",
    "for instance , for galaxies with a strong uv continuum steidel & hamilton ( 1992 ) used an optical colour criteria to identify lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath20 and adelberger et al .",

    "the small field of view of imaging cameras has hampered the accurate measurement of large scale clustering .",
    "in particular , the lack of wide field near - ir instruments has prevented the detection of distant , passive galaxies since the bulk of their emission is redshifted to longer wavelengths .",

    "2007 ) mounted on the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . of the 5 sub - surveys ,",
    "the dxs is a deep , wide survey mapping 35 deg@xmath3 with 5@xmath26 point - source sensitivity of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "wfcam is composed of four rockwell hawaii - ii 2k@xmath302k array detectors ( casali et al .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.4 arcsec / pixel , so the size of each detector is 13.7@xmath3013.7 arcmin@xmath3 .",
    "the relatively large pixel scale can lead to an undersampled point spread function ( psf ) . to avoid this problem microstepping is applied .",
    "in addition there are gaps between detectors , and the width is similar with the size of a detector .",
    "therefore 4 exposures are needed to make a contiguous image , i.e. 4@xmath304 image tiling 0.8 deg@xmath3",
    ".    in this study we deal with @xmath43.3 deg@xmath3 sa22 field centred on @xmath31 22@xmath32 19@xmath33 17.0@xmath34 , @xmath35 + 00@xmath36 44@xmath33 00.0@xmath34 ( j2000 ) from ukidss dr5 .",

    "the ukidss standard pipeline creates a catalogue by merging detected objects for each array . however , foucaud et al . ( 2007 ) pointed out that creating a contiguous image before extracting the catalogue is more helpful to optimise depths in overlap regions and to make a homogeneous image .",

    "dye et al .",
    "( 2006 ) discussed various artefacts of ukidss early data release ( edr ) , including internal reflections and electronic cross - talk .",
    "the former have been eradicated by additional baffling and restricting the observations with respect to moon angle but the latter still have to be removed .",
    "cross - talk is straightforward as each cross - talk feature is a fixed number of pixels from a bright star and can hence be flagged ( see below ) .",
    "the standard casu detection pipeline is not optimised for galaxy photometry so we choose to create our own photometric catalogues from mosaicked images .",
    "firstly , four contiguous images were created from the reduced images including astrometric and photometric information from ukidss standard pipeline .",
    "as mentioned above , we used @xmath4 3.3 deg@xmath3 field which is composed of four 0.8 deg@xmath3 fields . instead of creating one large contiguous image ,",
    "four separate images were made , since the integration time for each exposure was changed from 5 seconds to 10 seconds after the first ukidss observing period . before stacking ,",
    "the flux scale of each array was calculated by using the _ zeromag _ from the ukidss standard pipeline .",
    "the swarp software , which is a resampling and stacking tool ( bertin et al .",
    "2002 ) , was run to stack the images .",
    "a weight map was created by swarp , and bad regions at the detector edges or around saturated stars were masked by visual inspection .",
    "secondly , objects were extracted from these contiguous images by running sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "to measure colours of objects , the flux has to be measured for the same part of each object .",
    "therefore the @xmath38-band image was transformed into the @xmath39-band image frame by iraf task geomap and geotran which calculate a transforming equation and transforms the images , respectively .",
    "also , in order to minimise the fraction of spurious objects , various combinations of thresholds and detection area were tested .",
    "finally , the @xmath39-band image was used as a detection image to detect faint objects in the other bands .",
    "colours were calculated using 2-arcsec aperture magnitudes for each band , and total magnitudes in @xmath39 were measured using the sextractor auto magnitude .",
    "a photometric calibration was applied by using the calibrated aperture magnitude of the point source catalogue from ukidss standard pipeline which was calibrated from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "thirdly , spurious objects such as cross - talk images and diffraction spikes were removed .",
    "the cross - talk images were located at multiples of 256 pixels from bright objects ( dye et al .",
    "we selected cross - talk candidates related to bright stars ( @xmath43 ) by position .",
    "all potential cross - talk images from the brightest stars ( @xmath44 ) were removed .",
    "however , those from fainter stars ( @xmath45 ) contain a fraction of real objects .",
    "fortunately , since cross - talk images of fainter hosts accompany dark spots around them , these spots were used to determine whether candidates are cross - talk images or real objects .",
    "in addition , spurious objects detected on diffraction spikes were selected by position from bright stars and removed . in total , 6 per cent of the objects were removed as spurious objects using these methods .",
    "we detected 303,473 bona fide objects from the masked 3.07 deg@xmath3 field .",
    "finally , a completeness test was performed to check the photometric quality .",
    "we randomly added 1,000 artificial stars into each image , and ran sextractor again with the same parameters .",

    "figure 1 shows the completeness of each field for @xmath38 ( top ) and @xmath39 ( bottom ) .",
    "horizontal and vertical lines indicate the 90 per cent completeness and the design depth of dxs , respectively .",
    "the completeness of dxs sa22 4 at @xmath38 is significantly lower than others .",
    "this was caused by the relatively high background value in this field .",
    "however , the other fields successfully reach the target magnitude limit in both bands .",
    "we followed the standard image reduction sequence for mosaic ccd , namely bias subtraction , flat - fielding by dome and sky flat images , masking bad pixels and removing cross - talk artefacts and cosmic rays .",
    "the usno - a2 catalogue was used to improve the astrometric solution for each field .",
    "this solution was also applied to project images so they had the same scale and astrometry using the iraf tasks geomap and geotran .",
    "finally , these projected images were combined by using median values , and exposure maps were used as a weight map .    as with",
    "the near - ir data , colours of galaxies have to be measured from the same part of each object .",
    "therefore , images for the same field have to be matched to have the same seeing . to do this",
    ", the better seeing images were degraded using the psfmatch task in iraf .",
    "the daophot package was used to select unsaturated stars and to create psf kernels .",
    "these kernels were then used to degrade better seeing images to the worst seeing .    in order to detect objects and measure fluxes , the same strategy used for",

    "the @xmath42-band image was used as the detection image .",
    "saturated stars and their halos were masked in the weight image to remove unreliable objects .",
    "various threshold values were tested , and the value minimising spurious objects was selected .",
    "finally , since the seeing of the ctio imaging was worse than the dxs , iso and auto magnitude were used to estimate colours instead of aperture magnitude and total magnitude .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) catalogue .",
    "aperture colours from sextractor were calibrated to those of sdss , and the absolute flux calibration was determined using the total magnitudes in @xmath42 with respect to those in the sdss . finally , we removed unreliable photometric results using a magnitude cut . to remove saturated stars , objects brighter than @xmath46",

    "the offsets were applied to the near - ir catalogue and then the offsets were recalculated .",
    "this process was repeated until the average offset was less than 0.1 arcsec .",
    "the calculated offsets were 0.05 arcsec toward the west and 0.43 arcsec toward the north . finally , the calculated offsets were removed from the near - ir catalogue , and the closest optically detected object within 1 arcsec was taken as the counterpart .",
    "a galactic extinction correction was applied to all objects .",
    "the coordinate of each object was used to measure the reddening value from a dust map ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "then the values were transformed into extinction values for each band using the coefficients in schlegel et al .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the goal of the colour criteria for eros and drgs are to select red galaxies that are likely to be at high redshift ( @xmath11 or @xmath19 ) . however , lane et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and quadri et al . (",
    "2007 ) find that the colour cut for drgs can include a significant fraction of relatively low redshift objects ( @xmath114 ) that are dust obscured . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the comparison of two different populations with clustering properties .",
    "table 7 lists correlation lengths of @xmath79 eros and @xmath18 drgs .",
    "it is apparent that brighter samples show stronger clustering .",
    "although the direct comparison of correlation length is difficult because of different slopes and redshift distributions , we can confirm that eros are more clustered than drgs from the comparison of figure 6 and 7 , and correlation lengths .",
    "this was also found by foucaud et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "however , it has been shown that the @xmath18 criterion selects @xmath0 objects as well as ones at @xmath19 ( grazian et al .",
    "2006 ; papovich et al .",
    "2006 ; conselice et al .",
    "2007 ; lane et al . 2007 ) .",
    "quadri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also pointed out that the fraction of @xmath115 drgs is 15 per cent at @xmath116 and 50 per cent at @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , from the different clustering properties of the two populations , we can contrast them at @xmath0 where most bright drgs and @xmath79 eros are located .",
    "the different clustering properties in the bin indicate that eros and drgs may have different characteristics .",
    "in fact , conselice et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrated that @xmath0 drgs show a broad range in stellar mass and that eros are more massive than drgs at the same redshift ( conselice et al .",
    "these mass differences can explain the stronger clustering of eros compared to bright drgs , since massive objects are expected to be more clustered .",
    "furthermore , contamination from low redshift drgs may lead to the variation of clustering between our samples and @xmath118 drgs seen in figure 7 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath119 drgs at @xmath120 magnitude range is @xmath440 per cent in nmbs redshift distribution .",
    "this effect is also verified by the weaker clustering of @xmath9 eros in the previous section .",
    "this means that when using a simple colour criterion it is difficult to avoid a contribution from different types of galaxy or galaxies over a wide range in redshift .",
    "our correlation lengths of drgs are apparently different from previous results .",
    "if a single power law is applied for our @xmath7 drgs , the correlation length is 9.5@xmath1211.0 @xmath122 mpc .",
    "this value is smaller than 14.1@xmath123 @xmath122 mpc with @xmath1240.5 redshift distribution or 11.1@xmath125 @xmath122 mpc using a gaussian redshift distribution with @xmath126 and @xmath1240.25 in foucaud et al .",
    "( 2007 ) but is within the error range of both of these estimates .",
    "these apparent differences may be caused by differences in the redshift distribution .",
    "the nmbs redshift distribution is broader and complicated than that assumed in foucaud et al . and is likely to better reflect the true drg redshift distribution .",
    "quadri et al .",
    "( 2008 ) measured @xmath12710.6@xmath1211.6 @xmath122 mpc on large scale for 2@xmath133 drgs .",
    "this is consistent with our results for faint drgs , but smaller than for our brighter drgs .",
    "the improvement in photometric redshift measurement for galaxies at @xmath11 that the nmbs provides is considerable .",
    "future broad band studies will benefit from the nmbs constraints on redshift distributions .       and @xmath79 eros.,width=283 ]",
    "cosmic variance is an important source of systematic error in the investigation of the high redshift universe ( somerville et al .",
    "in particular , it is a significant contribution to the uncertainty in galaxy number counts and luminosity function ( somerville et al .",
    "2004 ; trenti & stiavelli 2008 ) .",
    "somerville et al . ( 2004 ) defined the relative cosmic variance with mean and variance of number counts .",
    "@xmath128    the last term gives the correction for poisson shot noise .",
    "garilli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) compared cosmic variances defined by the above equation and correlation functions from the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ) data , and argued that the values were in agreement .",
    "therefore , we simply used the above equation to estimate the cosmic variance .",
    "we divided the sa22 field into 9 sub - fields using two criteria , ctio blanco field of view ( @xmath40.36 deg@xmath49 ) and wfcam field of view ( @xmath40.8 deg@xmath49 ) , with @xmath79 and @xmath7 eros .",
    "however the actual masked average areas were @xmath40.27 deg@xmath49 and @xmath40.63 deg@xmath49 for blanco and wfcam size fields , respectively . the number density of eros in each field was calculated and used in equation 8 .",
    "we note that the field - to - field ratios of number density were consistent with those for various brighter magnitude limits .",
    "therefore , the field - to - field variation at this magnitude range is not a systematic effect , unlike a change in the limiting magnitude or area .",
    "the measured cosmic variances were 0.30 and 0.20 for blanco and wfcam field size , respectively .",
    "in fact , it is known that the spatial distribution of eros is inhomogeneous ( daddi et al .",
    "2000 ; kong et al .",
    "2006 ) , at least in part due to the strong clustering that eros exhibit .",
    "figure 16 shows the spatial distribution of @xmath79 and @xmath7 eros . as checked by the number density variation of each sub - field and figure 16 ,",
    "the distribution of our eros is also inhomogeneous .",
    "there are some overdense regions in the northern part of the field .",
    "moreover , figure 17 shows the angular correlation functions corrected for the integral constraint of @xmath79 and @xmath7 eros in each sub - field by blanco size ( left ) and wfcam size ( right ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate the best fit of the correlation function for @xmath79 and @xmath7 eros in the whole field .",
    "it appears that the correlation functions show the most variation on blanco field size scales . in particular , the standard deviations of the amplitudes of angular correlation function on large scales are 0.011 and 0.007 for ctio and wfcam size sub - fields , respectively . also , the standard deviations of the correlation lengths are 4.5 and 2.8 @xmath122 mpc respectively .",
    "these results demonstrate that cosmic variance for these field sizes can significantly affect the uncertainty of the measured clustering strength and is likely to have been the dominant source of error in previous clustering analyses of high redshift galaxies .",
    "it is apparent that a large - area survey is important not only to confidently measure number counts but also to investigate clustering properties .",
    "we have used near - ir images from ukidss dxs dr5 and @xmath2 optical images from ctio 4 m blanco telescope to investigate the clustering properties of eros and drgs in @xmath4 3.3 deg@xmath49 sa22 field .",
    "this is the largest area survey of such galaxies to date , and using the precise redshift distributions from the nmbs we have made the most accurate measurements of the cluster of eros and drgs .",
    "the results are summarised as follows ;    1 .",
    "colour selection criteria were applied to extract eros and drgs . in total 5,383 eros with @xmath79 , @xmath98 and @xmath100 were selected .",
    "in addition , 3,414 drgs were extracted by a @xmath18 with @xmath129 and @xmath101 limits .",
    "the number density of eros was well matched to previous studies once the differences in selection method were taken into account .",
    "similarly , the number density of drgs was very well matched with the results from the ukidss uds field .",
    "both populations showed strong clustering properties .",
    "those of eros are best described by a double power law with inflection at @xmath4 0.6@xmath5 - 1.2@xmath5 . assuming a power law ,",
    "@xmath60 , ( @xmath69 , @xmath78 ) of @xmath130 18.8 and @xmath113 4.5 eros were ( 0.00414 , 0.99 ) and ( 0.04205 , 0.40 ) for small and large scales respectively .",
    "3 .   additionally a double power law is required to fit the angular correlation function of drgs with @xmath351.38 and 0.47 for small and large scale respectively .",
    "our relatively bright magnitude limit samples are diluted by @xmath0 drgs , so our clustering shows different trends when compared to deeper samples dominated by @xmath118 drgs .",
    "the angular two - point correlation function of eros shows clear trends with different magnitude limits , although those for faint samples may be dominant by relatively blue eros due to the optical limit . with a fixed power law slope ,",
    "the amplitude for small scales decreased at fainter magnitudes , but that for large scales was invariable with magnitude .",
    "these trends were also confirmed by the real space correlation length .",
    "on the other hand , with variable slopes , the correlation function at bright limits is steeper than for samples with fainter limits .",
    "5 .   the colour limited correlation function of eros presents slightly different features from the magnitude limited function . with a fixed slope , clustering amplitudes and real space correlation lengths for small and large scales",
    "were increased with redder colours .",
    "slopes were comparable between various colour cuts . 6 .",
    "the eros were classified into ogs and dgs by their @xmath10 vs. @xmath8 colours .",
    "the correlation functions of magnitude limited ogs show an apparent break at 0.6@xmath5 - 1.2@xmath5 and similar amplitude at large scales .",
    "the redder ones have stronger clustering .",
    "however , the functions for dgs , showed much weaker clustering .",
    "the relative proportion of ogs and dgs with colour and magnitude can explain the different trends seen in the clustering of the full sample of eros .",
    "eros selected either with @xmath9 or @xmath10 colours show different correlation functions , especially on large scales .",
    "the eros selected by @xmath83 are more clustered than those by the @xmath9 selection criteria .",
    "this may be caused by the different redshift distribution , since the @xmath9 criterion extracts more low redshift galaxies than the @xmath10 criterion .",
    "eros are more clustered than drgs over the same redshift range ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is evidence that the two populations at this redshift are different and eros are likely to be intrinsically more massive than drgs .",
    "9 .   by dividing the full survey field in to sub - fields of different sizes",
    "we demonstrate that cosmic variance is a significant issue for measurements of correlation function and is likely to have been the dominant source of error in previous measurements of high redshift red galaxy clustering .",
    "the results from this analysis illustrate the importance of sampling the widest possible fields in the near - infrared in order to recover representative clustering properties of distant galaxies . in the near future",
    "the combination of ukidss and vista surveys will cover more than an order of magnitude larger area to comparable depth .",
    "our ability to extract the clustering of eros in these areas is limited only by the depth of comparable optical imaging .",
    "we will be applying the same analysis to the other three dxs fields and making use of the additional _ spitzer _ data that these fields enjoy to refine the selection into narrower photometric redshift slices and fitting these the halo occupation distribution models .",
    "finally , ero samples are now of sufficient size to offer direct tests to galaxy formation models in terms of number density _ and _ clustering so future comparisons to semi - analytic simulations will be more powerful ( gonzalez - perez , in preparation ) .",
