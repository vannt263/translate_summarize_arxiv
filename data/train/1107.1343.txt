    "all in all , quantum numbers compatible with the experiment are the fundamental ingredients in theoretical analysis of composite particles within any specific model .",
    "we notice that @xmath0 was observed in the @xmath22 decay process . since the @xmath16 has negative g - parity , due to emission of the pion , the newly observed @xmath0 has positive g - parity . in consideration that it is charged , the known quantum numbers of @xmath0 are @xmath23 .",

    "mass property is expected to be helpful for understanding the configuration of bottomonium - like resonances @xmath31 . in the hadronic scale , it is difficult to get reliable theoretical estimate for the mass using the perturbative qcd . therefore , we need some non - perturative methods to describe the non - perturative phenomena .",

    "the qcd sum rule attempts to link the hadron phenomenology with the interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "it contains three main ingredients : an approximate description of the correlation function in terms of intermediate states through the dispersion relation , a description of the same correlation function in terms of qcd degrees of freedom via an ope , and a procedure for matching these two descriptions and extracting the parameters that characterize the hadronic state of interest .    in the phenomenological side , the correlation function",
