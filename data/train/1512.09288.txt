    "quantum memories ( qms ) are important devices in quantum information science .",
    "they provide an interface between flying and stationary quantum bits and are at the heart of several applications including quantum information networks @xcite , quantum repeaters @xcite , linear optics quantum computing @xcite , and multi - photon quantum light sources @xcite .",
    "several qm demonstrations have been reported recently in atomic and solid state systems @xcite . in order to progress towards large scale quantum information architectures involving several qms",
    ", it is important to rely on devices that can be easily duplicated and integrated .",
    "this would facilitate the scalability and the realization of complex optical circuitry involving qms .",
    "furthermore , the tight light confinement achieved in waveguide structures would lead to a strong enhancement of the light matter interaction .",
    "finally , the integration of qms with other required devices , such as quantum light sources and single photon detectors , would be greatly simplified .",
    "solid state systems are well suited for the exploration of integrated qms , and in particular rare - earth doped solids showed promising properties with bulk crystals @xcite .",
    "two approaches have been explored towards integrated rare - earth qms so far .",
    "the first one is to integrate rare earths in already available systems for waveguides @xcite .",
    "quantum light storage has been performed in a ti@xmath3:tm@xmath0:linbo@xmath4 waveguide fabricated by ti@xmath3 in - diffusion @xcite , where also more recently an integrated processor has been implemented @xcite .",
    "these demonstrations were limited to the mapping of light field into optical atomic excitations .",
    "moveover , the linbo@xmath4 matrix , although suitable for waveguide fabrication , degrades the coherence properties of the rare - earth ions , which then limits the storage performances , e.g. in terms of storage times @xcite .",
    "the second approach consists in realizing waveguides in crystals already used for demonstrating bulk qm and suitable for long term storage of quantum information , e.g. y@xmath1sio@xmath2 .",
    "photonic crystal waveguides and cavities have been fabricated in nd@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 and er@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 , using focused ion beam milling @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the coherence properties of the rare - earth ions are preserved during the fabrication process , which is very promising for quantum applications .",
    "this fabrication technique is however challenging to extend to mm long waveguides , which may be useful to achieve high storage and retrieval efficiencies .",
    "also , the ions used so far possess only two - fold ground states , which restricts the storage of light to the excited state , strongly limiting the achievable storage times . in order to attain spin - state storage , which enables long term storage and on demand - read - out , ions with a three - fold ground state , such as eu@xmath0 or pr@xmath0 ,",
    "should be used @xcite .",
    "pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystals are currently one of the best systems for quantum memory applications . very efficient",
    "storage of weak coherent states @xcite has been demonstrated in this material , as well as the longest storage time ever demonstrated in any system , in the order of 1 minute for classical images @xcite .",
    "recently the first demonstration of an on - demand quantum memory for time - bin qubits @xcite has been reported using this crystal .",
    "the coherence properties of devices based on teo@xmath1 slab waveguides deposited on a pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystal have been measured to be consistent with those of bulk ions @xcite , which is promising for the implementation of integrated rare - earth based quantum devices . nevertheless , in such a system the active ions are only evanescently coupled to the waveguide .    here",
    ", we propose an alternative way to fabricate waveguides in pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 using femtosecond laser micromachining ( flm ) , where the active ions are directly coupled to the light .",
    "flm demonstrated in the past two decades to be a very powerful technology for the direct inscription of high quality optical waveguides in the bulk of both amorphous and crystalline transparent substrates @xcite .",
    "several complex integrated photonic devices have been developed with this technique , ranging from all optical routers @xcite and power dividers @xcite , to modulators @xcite , and frequency converters @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that laser written waveguide circuits in glass are suitable for supporting the propagation of photonic qubits @xcite , and represent a promising platform for the development of the rapidly growing field of integrated quantum photonics @xcite .",
    "the class of materials where waveguide writing with flm has been demonstrated includes several rare - earth doped crystals , e.g. nd : yag , yb : yag , nd : yvo@xmath5 , and pr : ylf among others , with applications mainly oriented towards the realization of integrated laser sources @xcite . at the best of our knowledge ,",
    "flm in pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystals has never been reported in the literature before , despite it would allow to take advantage of the direct access to the active ions and the exceptional performances as light storage medium .    in this paper , we demonstrate that the coherence properties of pr@xmath0 ions in fs - laser written waveguides are not affected by the fabrication procedure .",
    "we show that the light confinement in the waveguide improves significantly the interaction with the active ions .",
    "finally , we perform storage and retrieval of light pulses using the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) protocol , both in the excited state and spin - states , demonstrating the first on - demand integrated optical memory .",
    "the substrate used is a pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 bulk crystal ( scientific material ) , @xmath6-long ( along the crystal @xmath7-axis ) and with a concentration of active ions of @xmath8 .",
    "optical waveguides are fabricated by flm adopting the so - called type ii configuration @xcite , where the fs - laser irradiation is used to directly inscribe into the substrate two closely spaced damage tracks , in correspondence of which the material locally expands and becomes amorphous .",
    "this procedure gives rise to the formation of a stress field in their proximity , which , in turn , causes a material refractive index alteration . by tailoring properly the irradiation parameters and geometry ,",
    "it is possible , with this method , to obtain a light guiding region , with positive refractive index change , localized between the two tracks .",
    "it is worth to highlight that in type ii waveguides the core region ( where most of the light remains confined ) is only marginally affected by the fabrication process , hence preserving all its bulk properties .",
    "single mode waveguides for 606 nm light have been fabricated accordingly , by inscribing pairs of damage tracks with a reciprocal distance of 25 @xmath9 and buried 100 @xmath9 beneath the sample top surface .",
    "each track is fabricated by focusing a femtosecond laser beam ( a home made yb : kyw oscillator , @xmath10=1030 nm , pulse duration @xmath11=300 fs @xcite ) inside the crystal volume , with optimized irradiation parameters : energy per pulse of 570 nj , repetition rate of 20 khz , uniform sample translation along the @xmath7-axis at the speed of 57 @xmath12 . a microscope objective with 50x magnification and 0.6 numerical aperture is used as focusing optics .",
    "note that , for higher laser repetition rates and equal energy deposited per unit volume ( at a fixed pulse energy ) we observed the formation of periodic disruptions along the damage tracks @xcite , which degrade the waveguide homogeneity and increase significantly the waveguide propagation losses . during the fabrication ,",
    "the crystal orientation is such that the fs - pulsed laser beam is parallel to the @xmath13-axis .",
    "the resulting waveguides support only one polarization mode , with the electric field oscillating parallel to the @xmath14-axis , which is compatible with the memory protocols , as it is the one that maximizes the interaction between the pr@xmath0 ions and the light field resonant to their @xmath15 optical transition at @xmath16 @xcite .    .",

    "we use the same beam for both memory preparation and input light pulses . after the modulating aom",
    ", the beam is steered to a separated optical table hosting the cryostat ( closed cycle cryocooler , oxford instruments ) where the waveguide sample is fixed and maintained at a temperature of about @xmath23 .",

    "the spot almost disappears , which confirms that the light is guided through the waveguide . as a matter of fact , in a bulk crystal the polarization perpendicular to the @xmath14-axis would only weakly interact with the pr@xmath0 ions , thus experiencing a higher transmission through the sample .    .",

    "the pulse sequence used is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2pe](a ) .",
    "it starts with an input pulse resonant with the @xmath33 transition between the ground @xmath34 and excited @xmath35 manifold of pr@xmath0 ( see level scheme in fig .",
    "[ afc ] ( a ) ) , which creates a coherent superposition of atomic excitations .",
    "a subsequent @xmath36-pulse after a time @xmath11 is used to refocus the dipoles associated to the collective excitation and induces thus the so called photon - echo after a time @xmath37 .",
    "when the time delay @xmath11 is increased , the amplitude of the echo is reduced due to the atomic decoherence .",
    "we thus estimate the optical coherence time @xmath31 from the decay of the echo efficiency ( fig . [ 2pe](b ) ) .",
    "we measure @xmath31 in single class absorption features of different optical depths ( @xmath38 ) on the @xmath33 transition @xcite prepared by optical pumping and by modulating the pulse power @xmath39 . to ensure efficient population transfer even when decreasing the pulse power ,",
    "the duration of the pulses @xmath40 is simultaneously increased , thus reducing their spectral bandwidth .",
    "figure [ 2pe](c ) summarizes the @xmath31 value obtained as a function of the quantity @xmath41 , which gives a measure of the excitation intensity ( full red circles ) .",
    "as expected , the less ions are excited by the pulses , the longer coherence times are obtained due to the suppression of instantaneous spectral diffusion effects @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the obtained values agree with those , also reported in fig .",

    "we prepare a single class @xmath48 wide absorption feature at the frequency of the optical transition to probe ( @xmath33 between the ground @xmath34 and excited @xmath35 manifold ) .",

    "[ rabi](a ) reports an example , where the long pulse , of power @xmath50 , is collected at the photodiode after the transmission through the optical waveguide ( solid curve ) .",
    "the pulse exhibits a fast oscillation with frequency about @xmath51 , i.e. the separation between the @xmath52 and @xmath53 ground states .",
    "we attribute the oscillation to beatings between the two transitions @xmath54 and @xmath55 which might be simultaneously excited by the pulse due to imperfect optical pumping .",
    "the rabi frequency is calculated in a trace corrected by the fast oscillation ( gray dashed curve in fig . [ rabi](a ) ) from the population inversion time , @xmath46 indicated with the dotted vertical lines , as @xmath56 .",

    "[ rabi](b ) as a function of the square root of the input power . for input powers",
    "up to @xmath57 the rabi frequency scales as the square root of the power , as expected , but at higher powers the slope changes as if a saturation occurred .",
    "this saturation may be due to the fact that the rabi frequency becomes comparable to the absorption feature width .",
    "further measurements are necessary to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "when moving the beam into the bulk ( black squares ) , the rabi frequency increases linearly with the square root of the power with a much lower slope than that observed in the waveguide ( the maximum being @xmath58 at @xmath59 ) . for input powers",
    "at which the behavior is linear , the waveguide features light - ion interaction strengths higher than in the bulk by about a factor 6 , due to the efficient light confinement .",
    "this value agrees with that theoretically obtained ( @xmath60 ) by comparing the average rabi frequency of a beam propagating along the bulk ( refractive index @xmath61 ) focused at the input facet with our measured waist of @xmath62 and of a beam confined in the waveguide with @xmath28 .",

    "the device efficiency @xmath83 , defined as the afc echo after the crystal divided by the input pulse before the crystal , can be estimated by multiplying @xmath81 by the waveguide transmission ( 50 @xmath76 ) and by exp ( -od@xmath84 ) , where od@xmath84 is the background absorption in the transparency window , due to imperfect optical pumping ( in our case od@xmath85 , see dashed line in fig .",

    "the possibility to operate coherent population transfer with significantly lower power is a fundamental advantage as the noise given by the control pulses is the main limitation for the implementation of many on - demand storage protocols at the single photon level .",

    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated an optical memory based on laser written waveguides in a pr@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 crystal .",
    "we showed that the waveguide fabrication does not alter the coherence properties of the bulk crystal , and that the light confinement in the crystal increases the light - matter interaction ( as measured by the rabi frequency ) by a factor of 6 compared to a bulk crystal with the same focusing .",
