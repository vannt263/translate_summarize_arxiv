    "the theory is known to be asymptotically free and to have a banks - zak fixed point @xcite at which the one and two loop beta functions balance to give a non - trivial , perturbative , conformal , ir fixed point . as @xmath5 falls the fixed point value rises until the perturbative regime is lost .",
    "based on the observation of chiral symmetry breaking in @xmath7 qcd it is presumed that at some critical @xmath8 the ir conformal theory is replaced by one with a chiral condensate and a mass gap .    a number of methods have been used to estimate @xmath8 .",
    "truncated schwinger - dyson equations suggest @xmath9 @xcite . in these models",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is triggered when the anomalous dimension of the quark anti - quark operator hits of order one and hence @xmath2 .",
    "to predict the critical value @xmath8 one needs to make an assumption for the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath5 at strong coupling . in @xcite the one loop form @xmath11",
    "is used and the criticality condition expanded at small @xmath11 giving @xmath12 as the condition if extended to strong coupling . using the two loop form for the running coupling in @xmath11 gives the prediction @xmath13 . ]",
    "@xcite . the precise value for @xmath8",
    "then depends on the truncation scheme , the choice made for the running coupling profile with energy scale , @xmath14 , and the anomalous dimension relation for the quark mass term , @xmath10 .",
    "other attempts to estimate the critical value have been made in @xcite-@xcite and typically give a similar estimate .",
    "recently there has been much interest in simulating such theories on the lattice too @xcite-@xcite the simulations are still in an early phase but already support the general picture from all these analyses .",
    "jarvinen and kiritsis @xcite have recently proposed a holographic model of the strongly coupled near conformal regime around @xmath8 ( the work in @xcite is also very relevant ) .",
    "their model consists of 5d supergravity with a dilaton field dual to the running coupling and a `` tachyon '' field dual to the chiral condensate .",
    "they impose potentials for all these fields that generate the known two loop running for the coupling and the perturbative relation for the anomalous dimension in the uv of their description .",
    "they predict the range @xmath15 and that the transition at @xmath8 is a bkt type transition in which the condensate grows exponentially from the transition ( as expected - see @xcite ) . in a sense all this physics",
    "is imposed by the choice of potentials in the model but those choices are reasonable and it is encouraging that the results match other estimates .    in this paper",
    "we wish to attempt a similar construction using an alternative holographic model of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the d3-d7 system @xcite provides the simplest and best understood holographic description of a strongly coupled gauge theory with quark fields . at heart",
    "it consists of @xmath16 @xmath17 super yang - mills theory with @xmath18 @xmath19 quark hypermultiplets . in the quenched approximation",
    "the theory is conformal and on the gravity side is described by probe d7 branes in @xmath20 .",
    "the theory is 3 + 1 dimensional at all energy scales and has a conformal uv in which the identification of the operator matching between the field theory and the gravity description is clean .",
    "the simplest description of chiral symmetry breaking is found by imposing a background magnetic field on this theory @xcite - the description is regular throughout and the interpretation again clear cut .",
    "interestingly the dbi action for the probe with the magnetic field present is equivalent to the same theory with a particular choice of running gauge coupling .",
    "this effective dilaton is not backreacted on the geometry .",
    "it therefore seems natural to move to phenomenological models where one simply imposes some running coupling on the theory by hand - the underlying reaction of the holographic description seems likely to correctly capture the resulting physics of chiral symmetry breaking . indeed in a recent paper we have looked at the phase structure of just such a model with a running coupling with a step change between two conformal regimes @xcite .",
    "the imposition of the two loop qcd running is a very similar analysis which we explore here , concentrating though on the transition to chiral symmetry breaking . placing the probe brane in the presence of the dilaton matching the two loop gauge running essentially looks at the dynamics of one of the @xmath18 quark flavours in a background backreacted to the full dynamics of the @xmath18 quarks .",
    "our model is more direct than that of jarvinen and kiritsis @xcite in that we simply impose the running of the gauge coupling , and also in a later analysis the qcd anomalous dimension relation , rather than imposing a potential and then solving for these quantities .",
    "if one had the correct gravity dual of the gauge theory then the more involved process would capture more of the dynamics but if we are simply modeling the gauge theory then our approach may be sufficient .",
    "first we will very naively impose the two loop qcd beta - function on the d3/d7 dynamics .",
    "we find that chiral symmetry breaking is induced for @xmath21 and that the transition to the chiral symmetry breaking phase is second order in nature .",
    "this value of @xmath8 is low relative to other estimates and the transition type is at odds with that argued for in qcd in @xcite .",
    "to understand this we recast the dbi action for small fluctuations about the chirally symmetric phase as a slipping mode in ads@xmath22 ( we study this analysis in more detail in the appendix ) .",
    "one can then plot its mass squared as a function of the radial coordinate and seek a violation of the breitenlohner freedman ( bf ) bound @xcite which would lead to an instability .",
    "the model only shows an anomalous dimension for the chiral condensate in the regimes where the dilaton is running and the size of the anomalous dimension is proportional to the strength of that running .",
    "our critical value of @xmath23 corresponds to the theory which first has sufficiently strong running present . in terms of the slipping mode mass",
    "squared the bf bound must be violated over a sufficient interval in the radial direction of the gravity description - within that interval the bf bound is substantially violated at the transition leading to the second order behaviour .",
    "this analysis highlights a failure of the d3/d7 system as analyzed so far - it has too much supersymmetry present . in the ir conformal regime",
    "the background gauge dynamics returns to that of @xmath17 super yang - mills .",
    "it has too much symmetry and does not induce an anomalous dimension for the quark mass / condensate no matter how large the gauge coupling .",
    "this is in direct contradiction to qcd where the anomalous dimension @xmath10 is directly proportional to the magnitude of the coupling , at least in the perturbative regime @xcite .",
    "simply put we need to introduce more supersymmetry breaking into the description .",
    "we show how by a choice of background dilaton the qcd one - loop anomalous dimension relation can be imposed on the model by hand .",
    "we next impose on top the two loop qcd running profile within the anomalous dimension relation .",
    "in this model the slipping mode s mass squared , @xmath24 , asymptotes to @xmath25 in the uv and to some lower ir fixed point value .",
    "as it passes through the bf bound of @xmath26 chiral symmetry breaking is triggered .",
    "the two loop running s ir fixed point implies that at the transition the ir mass squared lies at exactly @xmath26 and this is the condition needed for a bkt transition ( see @xcite for the first examples of holographic bkt transitions ) , which we indeed observe . in this model @xmath13 .",
    "it s worth stressing that the bf bound is violated in these holographic models precisely when @xmath27 and , using the usual conformal ads mass - operator dimension relation , @xmath2 .",
    "this seems a robust holographic prediction , particularly since we envisage a conformal ir regime where the ads mass - dimension relation is expected to hold .",
    "note that @xmath8 and the bkt transition behaviour are completely determined by the ir fixed point behaviour of the coupling and the precise non - perturbative running is not crucial .",
    "there are more vagueries in the precise prediction of @xmath8 since we must assume a non - perturbative relation between the anomalous dimension and the value of the ir coupling .",
    "we have used the leading perturbative relation between @xmath24 and the one loop anomalous dimension and extended it to the non - perturbative regime , giving criticality when @xmath28 and @xmath13 .",
    "given the full qcd dynamics this value may be different though .",
    "our starting point is the holographic d3/d7 system @xcite .",
    "strings tied to the surface of the @xmath29 d3 branes generate the adjoint representation fields of the @xmath17 gauge theory .",
    "strings stretched from the d3 to the d7 are the quark fields in the fundamental representation of the @xmath30 group .    in the strong coupling limit",
    "the d3 branes are replaced by the geometry that they induce .",
    "we will consider a gauge theory with a holographic dual described by the einstein frame geometry ads@xmath31 @xmath32 where we have split the coordinates into the @xmath33 of the gauge theory , the @xmath34 and @xmath35 which will be on the d7 brane world - volume and two directions transverse to the d7 , @xmath36 .",
    "the radial coordinate , @xmath37 , corresponds to the energy scale of the gauge theory .",
    "the radius of curvature is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 the number of colours .",
    "the @xmath40 limit of this theory is dual to the @xmath17 super yang - mills theory where @xmath41 is the constant large @xmath42 asymptotic value of the gauge coupling .",
    "in addition we will allow ourselves to choose the profile of the dilaton as @xmath43 .",
    "simplistically this represents the running of the gauge theory coupling , @xmath44 , where the function @xmath45 as @xmath40 . for the coupling profiles we will consider later the uv form of @xmath46 will have weak logarithmic running present",
    "- we will impose a uv cut off when @xmath47 corresponding roughly to the scale where the holographic dual should be matched to perturbative qcd . above that cut off we simply set @xmath47 .",
    "the physics we study is all in the ir and not affected by the precise form of this cut off though . in the final section",
    "we will use the dilaton function as an input to the dbi action for the quark physics to enforce the qcd anomalous dimension relation . at this point",
    "the relation between the dilaton , the gauge coupling and phenomenological corrections to the dbi action become less clear but our philosophy is simply to phenomenologically enforce the correct quark physics in the dbi action .",
    "we will introduce a single d7 brane probe into the geometry to represent the dynamics of one quark in the theory - by treating the d7 as a probe we are working in a quenched approximation although we can reintroduce some aspects of the @xmath18 quark loops through the running coupling s form .",
    "this system has a @xmath48 axial symmetry on the quarks , corresponding to rotations in the @xmath49-@xmath50 plane , which will be broken by the formation of a quark condensate .",
    "the hope is that the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking for the quark described by the probe is generic across many gauge theories and the results will be applicable to qcd .",
    "we find the d7 embedding function e.g. @xmath51 .",
    "the dirac born infeld ( dbi ) action in einstein frame is given by @xmath52_{ab } }   \\\\   & =   -\\overline{t}_7 \\int { \\mbox{${\\mathrm{d}}$}}^4x~ { \\mbox{${\\mathrm{d}}$}}\\rho ~ \\rho^3 \\beta \\sqrt{1 + ( \\partial_\\rho l)^2 } \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 when we have integrated over the 3-sphere on the d7 .",
    "the equation of motion for the embedding function is therefore @xmath56 - 2 l \\rho^3 \\sqrt{1 + ( \\partial_\\rho l)^2 } { \\partial \\beta \\over \\partial r^2 } = 0 \\,.\\ ] ] the uv asymptotics of this equation , provided the dilaton returns to a constant so the uv dual is the @xmath17 super yang - mills theory , has solutions of the form @xmath57 , where we can interpret @xmath58 as the quark mass ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 is proportional to the quark condensate .",
    "the embedding equation ( [ embed ] ) clearly has regular solutions @xmath61 when @xmath62 is independent of @xmath42 - the flat embeddings of the @xmath19 karch - katz theory .",
    "equally clearly if @xmath63 is none trivial in @xmath49 then the second term in ( [ embed ] ) will not vanish for a flat embedding .",
    "there is always a solution @xmath64 which corresponds to a massless quark with zero quark condensate ( @xmath65 ) . in the pure @xmath19 gauge theory with @xmath47",
    "this is the true vacuum . in the symmetry",
    "breaking geometries @xcite this configuration is a local maximum of the potential .",
    "if the coupling is larger near the origin then the d7 brane will be repelled from the origin ending at @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the symmetry breaking of these solutions is visible directly @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 symmetry corresponds to rotations of the solution in the @xmath49-@xmath50 plane .",
    "an embedding along the @xmath34 axis corresponds to a massless quark with the symmetry unbroken .",
    "the symmetry breaking configurations though map onto the flat case at large @xmath34 ( the uv of the theory ) but bend off axis breaking the symmetry in the ir .",
    "@xmath68 , the ir quark mass , is a good order parameter for studying the chiral symmetry breaking that also reflects the bound state masses of the theory .",
    "our first analysis is straightforward .",
    "we impose the two loop running of the qcd gauge coupling on the dilaton profile of the d3/d7 system . that running is determined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 in the @xmath71",
    ", we omitted a subleasing term @xmath72 at large @xmath29 .",
    "we simply identify the radial direction @xmath42 with the rg scale of the field theory and set @xmath73 .",
    "as is well known these equations have logarithmic running in the uv and an ir fixed point that grows from zero as @xmath5 is reduced from @xmath74 which is first achieved in the ir for @xmath13 ] .    here",
    "the uv is not strictly conformal although it approaches it at weak coupling asymptotically .",
    "nevertheless it is easy to look for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we continue to associate massless quarks with d7 embeddings that approach the @xmath34 axis at large @xmath34 and seek solutions that bend off axis with that uv boundary condition . in fact the simplest identifier of chiral symmetry breaking is to look for solutions that begin with @xmath67 and shoot out to lie below @xmath76 in the uv .",
    "we use the value of @xmath68 , the ir quark mass , as the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking .    in fig",
    "[ cxfirst]a we show a plot of @xmath68 vs @xmath5 .",
    "the transition is clearly second order and by fitting we determine it to be mean field with critical exponent 1/2 .",
    "this second order nature is of course at odds with expectations that the transition with @xmath5 should be of the bkt type @xcite .    to understand this behaviour",
    "let us perform a linearized analysis on our dbi action to see why the flat embedding @xmath76 becomes unstable .",
    "we have an action , which is proportional to , @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "we expand for small @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 . to make the kinetic term canonical",
    ", we can now make a coordinate transformation on @xmath34@xmath82    now the first term in our action can be recast by setting @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "this is the action of a canonical @xmath86 scalar in ads@xmath22 .",
    "the remaining term in the action becomes @xmath87 so we have a ads@xmath22 scalar with @xmath34 dependent mass squared @xmath88 we plot this mass against @xmath34 in fig [ bfv]a for a variety of choices of @xmath5 .",
    "we first note that the mass squared of the slipping mode approaches @xmath25 in both the uv and ir , which we will return to shortly .",
    "the instability that is causing our phase transition with @xmath5 is in the intermediate period where the mass squared is falling below the bf bound of @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath89 is the first case where the bf bound is met at one point in @xmath34 but that this value of @xmath5 is significantly above the critical value @xmath90 found above .",
    "apparently the bf bound must be violated in a region of @xmath34 for the instability to trigger a transition . at the point of transition",
    "the bf bound is violated in a range of @xmath34 and the effective mass squared lies considerably below the bf bound in the mid - region .",
    "such a scenario has caused a second order transition .",
    "see and footnote [ fn0 ] for more examples .",
    "this plot of the mass squared of the slipping mode against @xmath34 reveals a number of failings of our most naive model .",
    "in particular the mass squared returns to @xmath25 in the ir .",
    "the reason is that the gauge coupling becomes constant in the ir conformal regime and the brane construction returns to that of the @xmath17 gauge theory with quarks .",
    "the mass squared is @xmath25 because the model returns to a highly supersymmetric configuration in the ir where the anomalous dimension of @xmath91 is protected to be @xmath92 .",
    "this is quite unlike in non - supersymmetric qcd where the anomalous dimension , @xmath10 , of the quark mass @xmath93 ( the dimension of @xmath91 is @xmath94 ) , at one loop , is given by @xmath95 at the ir fixed point one expects a non - zero @xmath10 .",
    "however , in our holographic model , using the naive scalar mass operator dimension relation , @xmath96 , we find @xmath97 where @xmath98 is defined in .",
    "strictly the relation @xmath96 is valid only in conformal regimes where the scalar mass is constant but we allow ourselves to use it slightly more liberally here .",
    "therefore , the model we present only conjures an anomalous dimension in the regime in which the coupling is running ( @xmath99 ) , breaking both conformal invariance and supersymmetry . for a model that is precociously asymptotically free such as @xmath100 qcd this deviation of our model from qcd is probably not so important for the phenomenology - in both cases the coupling grows rapidly and",
    "a quark condensate is triggered .",
    "if we wish to model the transition to chiral symmetry breaking though with changing @xmath5 , where we leave an ir fixed point theory , it is more crucial .",
    "our estimate of @xmath90 is most likely an under estimate because we have not included the contribution to @xmath10 from the absolute value of the coupling @xmath101 .",
    "our naive model above of the @xmath5 dependence of qcd suffered from an excess of supersymmetry in the ir regime , left over from our underlying construction .",
    "the model included the running gauge coupling but not the qcd anomalous dimension relation .",
    "we will now enforce the perturbative qcd form of that relation ( with the two loop qcd form for @xmath101 ) on the model as an alternative way to include the qcd physics .",
    "that is we use the two loop relation to fix the coupling at the ir fixed point and then use the one loop anomalous dimension relation to predict @xmath8 from the point where the slipping mode mass becomes @xmath26 .",
    "let us first consider the ir conformal regime where we want a constant non - zero value of @xmath102 .",
    "our model predicts the slipping mode mass @xmath103 where we substitute @xmath46 for @xmath101 since we have given up the identification of @xmath46 in the dbi action with the gauge coupling .",
    "here we are concentrating on making @xmath10 match qcd instead so the quark physics is correct .",
    "the choice of @xmath46 that gives such a constant @xmath104 is @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) for which we find @xmath107 by , @xmath98 is related to @xmath108 @xmath109 here the use of is more valid than in the previous section ; the scalar mass in the action given by ( [ qa1 ] ) and ( [ qa2 ] ) is constant and by ansatz @xmath110 matches the rg scale of qcd .",
    "it is possible that back - reaction between the geometry and the scalar might disturb this relation but it seems fairly sound .",
    "note the conditions that @xmath111 and @xmath2 are the same , where @xmath112 .",
    "this model displays a bkt transition as @xmath113 is changed continuously through @xmath2 . as usual the bkt transition occurs due to the presence of an infinite number of unstable , efimov modes at the transition point @xcite .",
    "we can see them here explicitly by considering the action for static , linearized , mesonic solutions around the @xmath76 embedding .",
    "the action is @xmath114 where a prime is a @xmath34 derivative and dot a time derivative .",
    "if we move to the inverse @xmath115-coordinate ( @xmath116 ) we have @xmath117 where a prime is now a @xmath115 derivative .",
    "we can now write the equation of motion for a solution of the form @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 which is a 1d schrodinger equation form with a @xmath121 potential . this problem is known and becomes unstable when the coefficient of the @xmath121 term is equal to @xmath122 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath2 in ( [ irgam ] ) . at that point",
    "an infinite number of unstable negative energy modes emerge from @xmath123 . at the critical value of @xmath122 all of those modes play a role in the transition generating the bkt transition .",
    "this discussion so far has been restricted to the ir and a more complete model would require that @xmath45 in the uv . a simple fix is to set @xmath124 . in this case , @xmath125\\ ] ]",
    "its ir asymptotic behavior is @xmath126 which is the same as ( 15 ) with a @xmath34-dependent correction .",
    "the ir behaviour matches our discussion above .    at this point",
    "we can make a simple model to extract the critical value of @xmath18 in qcd .",
    "the two loop qcd beta function has a fixed point at @xmath127 in the banks - zak regime where perturbation theory applies , @xmath128 .",
    "the order @xmath101 relation between the @xmath129 and @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 where we used and and @xmath132 denote the order @xmath133 relation .",
    "of course we have no true idea how to continue this relation into the non - perturbative regime but following the spirit of @xcite we will simply assume ( [ guess ] ) applies at all values of the coupling .",
    "the holographic model tells us that the transition will occur when @xmath27 @xmath134 so we find , using the one loop qcd anomalous dimension result @xmath135 this gives @xmath136 .",
    "note that this amounts to @xmath137 , which coincides to the one - loop perturbative field theory computation @xcite .",
    "finally we can numerically check the bkt nature of the transition as well .",
    "we can simply set @xmath138 with @xmath113 and @xmath5 related , through the ir relations ( [ simg ] ) and ( [ guess ] ) , @xmath139 we then numerically solve for the d7 embedding , @xmath79 as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath68 , the ir quark mass , is a useful order parameter - we show the result for @xmath68 vs @xmath5 in fig [ cxfirst]b - the bkt type transition is apparent with @xmath13 .",
    "close to @xmath8 this simple model and the case @xmath140 coincide since the dynamics is dominated in the far ir .      to construct a full model of the rg flow in the conformal window , one should enforce the qcd anomalous dimension formula ( [ guess ] ) at all energy scales or @xmath34 .",
    "in particular we want @xmath141    to find the associated @xmath46 one can re - arrange for @xmath110 , @xmath142 differentiate , and find the differential equation @xmath143^{1/2 } = 0 \\,.\\ ] ] we can solve for @xmath46 numerically by shooting from some initial value of @xmath34 and trialling various values of the initial condition @xmath144 .",
    "typically the true solution lies on the crossover between solutions that are real at all @xmath34 and those that go complex so the correct initial condition can be tuned to .",
    "once found the numerical solution can be tested that it is a good solution of ( [ getlambda ] ) and that it has the ir fixed point behaviour @xmath145 where @xmath113 and @xmath5 are related by ( [ xq ] ) .",
    "we can then use these solutions to solve for @xmath79 as a function of @xmath34 - close to @xmath8 the results are again those in fig [ cxfirst]b since the dynamics is entirely determined by the ir fixed point .",
    "we have presented two simple holographic models of @xmath4 behaviour of qcd at large @xmath29 . in our first model",
    "we imposed the qcd two loop running directly on the d3/d7 system through a non - backreacted dilaton profile .",
    "we found chiral symmetry breaking sets in at @xmath90 at a second order transition .",
    "the transition is expected to be at a larger value of @xmath5 and to be of bkt type @xcite and we highlighted that this discrepancy is due to the ir supersymmetry of the model forcing @xmath146 . in a second model we imposed the perturbative qcd @xmath10 relation and found a bkt transition at @xmath13 .    whilst these models are much less sophisticated than the very nice model of jarvinen and kiritsis @xcite , in which the ads - space backreacts to the running coupling and the quark condensate , we believe they highlight the key ingredients .",
    "one must input into the model , either directly as we do , or indirectly through supergravity potentials as in @xcite , the form of the running coupling and the impact that has on the quark anomalous dimension . since we do not have the true qcd dual all of this is the model builder s choice .",
    "the clear prediction from ads is that the chiral transition will occur when the ads slipping mode associated to the quark condensate hits a mass squared at the ir fixed point of @xmath26 , the bf bound .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath2 .",
    "the miransky scaling or bkt nature of the transition is then also very clear in the holographic description through the presence of effimov modes .",

    "the bf bound is violated at @xmath182 and this violation by the continuous parameter , @xmath183 or @xmath174 , implies the bkt transition . if @xmath184 then @xmath185 , which is consistent with .        where @xmath187 by , the uv mass is @xmath25 in @xmath188 , while , by , the ir mass is ( @xmath189 ) , @xmath190 in @xmath157 .",
    "it satisfies the bf bound for all @xmath174 and @xmath183 .",
    "however , the instability is in the intermediate regime .",
    "we can see this by expanding the action in the regime @xmath191 , of which linearized equation of motion is @xmath192 the slipping mode is effectively the scalar of @xmath193 in ads@xmath194 , which violates the bf bound .",
    "it also can be seen more directly from , where the second term and third term cancel out , leaving the first term , @xmath195 .",
    "note that this instability happens only for a large enough @xmath174 ( or small enough @xmath175 ) to satisfy the condition @xmath191 .",
    "note also that the bf mass violation is _ finite _ as we dial @xmath174 for a fixed @xmath175 , and the phase transition turns out to be of mean - field typea non - mean field ( but non - bkt ) type transition also can be understood in the same way . in the model studied in @xcite , it can be shown that an instability can arise in the range ( @xmath196 ) , where @xmath197 is a phenomenological operator with dimension @xmath198 .",
    "this range is essentially where the operator @xmath197 dominates over @xmath199 . ] .",
    "( the _ infinitesimal _ violation of the bf bound as in is a characteristic of the bkt transition . )",
    "there is alternative way , in which we keep the uv ads space for all @xmath34 .",
    "for this , we need to redefine the coordinate system by @xmath200 so @xmath201 which is defined only for @xmath202 .",
    "otherwise , the integral diverges and @xmath110 is not defined .",
    "( so , the previous examples of the d7(d3 ) probe in ads@xmath22 @xmath150 @xmath151 can not be analyzed in this way ; @xmath113 is too big . ) in terms of a new coordinate @xmath110 , the action reads @xmath203 where we consider only the case @xmath166 , so that we can use .",
    "note that for a function @xmath204 ( the normalization of @xmath205 does not matter , since any normalization factor is canceled in ) , @xmath24 is constant : @xmath206 one might wonder if this analysis is consistent with the previous one ( appendix a.1 ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath207 , both analyses are applicable .",
    "they must be consistent since the bf bound analysis is an effective tool and how to interpret the action should not change the physics .",
    "i.e. for @xmath207 , we can interpret the action of either ( 1 ) a scalar in ads@xmath22 with @xmath208 or ( 2 ) a scalar in ads@xmath209 with @xmath193 .",
    "however , both cases tell us the scalar mass violate their own bf bound , so they are consistent . to see this more clearly ,",
    "let us check the bf bound conditions , which are @xmath210 in appendix a.1 , and @xmath211 in this subsection .",
    "these seemingly different conditions indeed give the same results : the bf bound is violated at the value of @xmath212 , @xmath213 therefore we may interpret our analysis as either ( 1 ) @xmath24 does not change but the effective background is changing ( 2 ) @xmath24 is changing but the geometry does not change .    of course , we can do a mixture : partial change of geometry and partial change of @xmath24 .",
    "how this works in general can be seen by the following simple example .",
    "the equation of the scalar field at the boundary of ads@xmath214 space ( @xmath215 ) reads @xmath216 by the definition @xmath217 , it can be transformed to @xmath218 it is formally interpreted as the scalar in ads@xmath161 space with the modified mass @xmath219 . in both cases",
    "the bf bound is the same , @xmath220 , so the physics does not change . especially , the equation for @xmath221 ( or @xmath222 ) corresponding to the effective ads@xmath223 is the schrodinger equation with the @xmath121 potential term and the @xmath224 potential plays a role for the bkt transition as discussed in @xcite and section [ sec4 ] .",
