    "since  zwicky ( 1933 ) first realised that unseen material is needed to explain the dynamics of galaxy clusters , many observations have indicated that large - scale structures are dominated by some form of dark matter .",
    "the now widely accepted cold dark matter ( cdm ) model provides a consistent explanation for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations , for type ia supernova distances , for clustering measures from galaxy redshift surveys , for galaxy cluster abundances and their evolution , and for the statistics both of weak gravitational lensing and of ly@xmath0 absorption in quasar spectra .",
    "the universe apparently contains about five times as much dark matter as ordinary baryons , providing in total about a quarter of the closure density .",
    "according to the cdm picture , every galaxy has its own dark matter halo , which may be partially disrupted in a group or cluster to produce a common halo .",
    "these structures can be predicted in great detail by numerical simulations , but the predictions are yet to be convincingly verified because we are unable to map the dark matter distribution in enough detail to make a proper comparison .",
    "weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies has allowed progress to be made , but only near the centres of the largest galaxy clusters is the signal - to - noise sufficient for true mapping",
    ". the limitations of this approach are clearly indicated by the recent image of a representative field made using deep hubble space telescope data by massey et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "the resolution and sensitivity of lensing maps based on galaxies are fundamentally limited by the finite number density and the intrinsic ellipticities of the sources . in this paper , we demonstrate that much higher fidelity and resolution can be achieved if future observations allow pregalactic hi to be used as the gravitationally lensed source .",
    "the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen during and before the epoch of reionisation ( @xmath1 ) fell out of thermal equilibrium with the cmb radiation , resulting in the absorption and emission of radiation .",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in the prospect of detecting and mapping this radiation using radio telescopes now under construction or in planning ( see furlanetto , oh & briggs 2006 , for an extensive review ) .",
    "this radiation provides an excellent source for gravitational lensing studies .",
    "structure is expected in the emission down to arcsecond scales , and at each point on the sky there will be @xmath2 statistically independent regions at different redshifts , and thus frequencies , that could in principle be observed .",
    "gravitational lensing will coherently distort the brightness temperature maps at these different frequencies . for each frequency",
    ", the gradient in the brightness temperature may be used to obtain an estimate of the lensing distortion .",
    "since the intrinsic structure in the hi gas that acts as noise on the estimate is uncorrelated for maps at ( sufficiently ) different frequencies , the coherent distortion of the brightness temperature can be measured with high accuracy if enough independent redshifts are observed . in this way",
    ", a map of the foreground matter density can be constructed ( zahn & zaldarriaga 2006 ; metcalf & white 2007 ) .    observing the radiation at high redshift is challenging .",
    "foregrounds of atmospheric , galactic , or extragalactic origin ( e.g. synchrotron radiation from electrons ) dominate over the signal in the relevant frequency range ( furlanetto , oh & briggs 2006 ) .",
    "the foregrounds are expected to vary much less with frequency ( and with position on the sky for galactic foregrounds ) than the signal from high - redshift hi structures ( zaldarriaga , furlanetto , & hernquist 2004 ; zahn & zaldarriaga 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , it is hoped that the foreground radiation and the signal may be separated by modelling the foregrounds as slowly varying functions of frequency .",
    "subtracting foregrounds from the observed radiation will be complicated and will contribute noise to the temperature map .",
    "in addition to the noise from foreground residuals , there is _ irreducible noise _ in the mass map constructed from the -lensing signal , which comes from the unknown intrinsic structure of the brightness temperature distribution . this noise can not be reduced by increasing the collecting area of the telescope , by increasing the integration time or by improving the removal of foregrounds .",
    "metcalf & white ( 2007 ) showed that if the signal - to - noise in the brightness temperature map at each frequency is greater than one , then the noise in the mass map will be close to the irreducible value . increasing the frequency resolution of the radio observations increases the number of effectively independent regions along the line - of - sight until the bandwidth becomes smaller than the radial correlation length of structure in the brightness temperature distribution . if the bandwidth is matched to the correlation length , the irreducible noise is minimised .",
    "the correlation length in turn depends on beam size , and is smaller for smaller beams . thus unlike galaxy lensing surveys , the irreducible noise _ decreases _ with increasing resolution for lensing . in practise ,",
    "there is a trade - off because smaller bandwidth means less flux , but this can be compensated by increasing collecting area and/or integration time . in this paper , we study what is achievable with an idealised radio telescope , so we assume that the irreducible noise level is reached , using values calculated by metcalf & white ( 2007 ) as a function of beam - size and frequency .    at least in principle , a lensing survey will be much less noisy than surveys using galaxies ( because of the larger effective number of sources ) and will have a substantially stronger signal ( because of the greater distance of the sources and the additional structure that lies in front of them ) . for a galaxy shear map , the noise increases with decreasing smoothing because fewer galaxies are used to estimate the shear at each point of the map .",
    "the opposite is true for lensing , where a smaller beam allows one to observe more independent sources along each line - of - sight .",
    "it should therefore be possible to make high - resolution images of the matter distribution at high signal - to - noise using lensing , while the smallest scale over which galaxy lensing can map with @xmath3 is @xmath4 , even using an ambitious dedicated space telescope .",
    "in addition , lensing will provide information about the mass distribution at redshifts much higher than can be probed by galaxy lensing .",

    "this is reasonable because angular size distances are a weak function of source redshift over the relevant range .",
    "the noise in the convergence map is worked out in metcalf & white ( 2007 ) under the assumption that the high - frequency components of maps of pregalactic hi decorrelate with increasing redshift separation in the same way as those of maps of the underlying cold dark matter distribution . in this case , the noise is very well approximated as a poisson process smoothed by the telescope beam , which we again model as gaussian .",

    "such detailed observations will provide a very direct and accurate test for structure - formation models .",
    "even with an ska - like telescope , halos with @xmath127 should be clearly detected out to high redshift .",
    "this contrasts strongly with mass maps constructed using gravitational lensing of distant galaxies , where high fidelity is only achievable for angular smoothings so large that all but the nearest and most massive individual objects are lost .",
    "our estimates of the irreducible noise are based on a convergence estimator that is not necessarily optimal .",
    "it may therefore be possible to achieve smaller ` irreducible ' noise levels than we quote . in practice , however , it is likely that other sources of error will dominate the overall budget , for example , the error introduced by incomplete foreground subtraction ( see furlanetto et  al . 2006 , for a review ) . for most purposes , imaging the surface density does not require reaching the irreducible noise limit ;",
    "the predicted signal is large enough to accommodate a noise level many times the irreducible value .",
    "in addition , the noise within a patch of area @xmath128 goes down like @xmath129 while the density fluctuations go down roughly like @xmath130 , so even if the noise is too large to map the surface density on the scale of a single beam , a high - fidelity map with larger smoothing can still be constructed ( as in the galaxy lensing case ) . the square kilometer array in its currently proposed configuration should be able to map the mass distribution on arcminute scales with moderate to high fidelity if reionisation is not completed too early ( metcalf & white 2007 ) . the optimal bandwidth for observing lensing is @xmath51 while the signal - to - noise for mapping the pregalactic hi at the same angular scales is maximal at larger bandwidths @xmath131 .",
    "lensing benefits from the stacking of many narrow redshift slices even if they are individually noise dominated while the temperature fluctuations themselves get diluted ( metcalf & white 2007 ) . to reach scales of a few arcseconds as discussed here will require a larger telescope with dense sampling .",
    "given the narrower science goals , this may be achievable with simpler and cheaper antennas .",
    "while high - resolution images of the cosmic mass distribution would be a unique product of observations of lensing , they are not the only reason to carry out such studies .",
    "if enough of the sky can be surveyed , cosmological parameters such as the density of dark energy and its evolution with redshift can be measured with much higher accuracy by a combination of lensing with galaxy lensing than they can by galaxy lensing alone or indeed by any other method proposed so far ( metcalf & white 2007 ) . the baseline configuration of ska may be powerful enough to achieve much of this improvement if problems with foregrounds can be overcome ."
