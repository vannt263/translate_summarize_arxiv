    "<S> we shall argue the above examples are special cases of a more general fact , namely translational invariant systems with _ topologically stable _ bulk nodes also possess protected gapless surface bound states . in the presence of disorder the otherwise degenerate zero energy band broadens into finite width , but does not lose the signature of gapless surface bound state .    </S>",

    "<S> this unusual behavior calls for the examination of possible nodal triplet pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically it has been proposed that the _ singlet _ gap function of lafepo possesses the so - called `` accidental nodes''@xcite where the nodal gap function transforms without any sign change under all point group operations . a schematic illustration of the proposed nodal structure is shown in fig .

    "<S> we have discussed , the e=0 states can be made eigenstates of it . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that for a fixed winding number the e=0 surface states with different @xmath60 eigenvalues localize at the opposite ends of the sample . reversing the winding number exchanges these localized states . </S>",
    "<S> thus local disorder potential can only mix e=0 states at surface momenta where _ opposite _ winding numbers occur . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out time reversal symmetry requires the 1d winding number to change sign from surface momentum @xmath61 to @xmath62 . as the result </S>",
    "<S> there are equal , opposite , intervals in the boundary bz with opposite winding numbers . </S>",
    "<S> smooth surface potentials do not mix them but sharp impurity potentials do . in the presence of the mixing the delta function density of states broadens into a peak centered around @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> therefore although the singular density of states at e=0 is not protected , a broadened version of it is . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly the @xmath64-wave pairing studied in conjunction with lafepo evades disorder broadening hence is strictly protected . </S>",
    "<S> this is because opposite winding number occurs for opposite spin . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]b are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71.,title=\"fig : \" ]    * detecting nodal spin liquids . * </S>",
    "<S> the search for spin liquid is a focused interest in current condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty with finding a spin liquid is precisely why they are novel - they are `` featureless '' in conventional sense . among different spin liquids </S>",
    "<S> there is a class that are nodal ( to ensure their stability we focus on the ones having @xmath72 gauge symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example such a spin liquid was proposed for the pseudogap state of the cuprates@xcite . like nodal superconductors described above </S>",
    "<S> , nodal spin liquid should have surface `` spinon '' flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> if exist these flat bands will give rise to curie behavior of local magnetic susceptibility hence allows for experimental detection , for example the low temperature susceptibility will diverge as @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , as discussed earlier , disorder broadens the singular density of state at @xmath63 into a peak hence renders the local magnetic susceptibility finite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition one might need to worry about the effect of residual spinon interaction on these flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> we believe if the residual spinon interaction is repulsive surface ferromagnetism will result .    * discussions . * </S>",
    "<S> experimentally one can prepare differently oriented surfaces by thin film growth and perform scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements to measure the local density of states associated with zbabs . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of using stm is it can probe @xmath74 length scale </S>",
    "<S> . therefore even when the surface is not ideal , it can pick up signals from surfaces with different local orientations . </S>",
    "<S> thus by scanning the tip it is possible to acquire the required data from a single sample .    </S>",
    "<S> after completion of this work we noticed a very recent experiment observing zero - bias conductance peak for fese@xmath75te@xmath76@xcite . </S>"
