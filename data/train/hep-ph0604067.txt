    "the emergence of complex patterns is one of the most distinct signatures of nonlinear interactions in natural systems .",
    "since einstein s pioneering work on brownian motion @xcite , it became clear that much can be accomplished by modeling the interactions of a system with its environment through the action of random and viscous forces . during most of the twentieth century , studies",
    "were mainly restricted to investigating the motion of a point particle in nonlinear potentials @xcite . with the advent of fast computers ,",
    "modeling of stochastic evolution added spatial dimensions , allowing for the quantitative study of spatio - temporal complex behavior . up to about ten years ago , most of the work concentrated in hydrodynamical and soft condensed - matter systems @xcite .",
    "recently , developments in high energy physics and cosmology have opened the interesting possibility that complex spatio - temporal behavior may also play a role in relativistic field theories , in particular during the early stages of cosmological evolution @xcite and may even be observed in high - energy colliders @xcite .    here",
    "we will briefly review some of the work done during the past few years which focused on understanding the effects of fast quenches on nonlinear scalar field theories .",
    "the quenches model both temperature quenches in the context of fast cosmological expansion ( in particular at scales close to the gut scale @xmath0 gev ) or the cooling of fireballs during high energy collisions such as those currently being investigated at rhic and soon at lhc .",
    "the quench may also represent a pressure quench , common in condensed matter physics or , more generally , the appearance of a low - energy effective interaction that modifies the effective potential of the long - wavelength modes of the field or order parameter describing the system s evolution .",
    "consider a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional real scalar field ( or scalar order parameter ) @xmath1 evolving under the influence of a potential @xmath2 .",
    "the continuum hamiltonian is conserved and the total energy of a given field configuration @xmath1 is , @xmath3= \\int d\\,^2x\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{t}\\phi)^2+\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + v(\\phi)\\right ] , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the potential energy density .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are positive definite and temperature independent .",
    "it is helpful to introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( we will henceforth drop the primes ) .",
    "prior to the quench , @xmath12 and the potential is an anharmonic single well symmetric about @xmath13 .",
    "the field is in thermal equilibrium with a temperature @xmath14 . at the temperatures considered ,",
    "the fluctuations of the field are well approximated by a gaussian distribution , with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and can be computed numerically ) .",
    "as such , within the context of the hartree approximation @xcite , the momentum and field modes in @xmath17-space can be obtained from a harmonic effective potential , and satisfy @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the hartree mass @xmath20 depends on the magnitude of the fluctuations ( and thus @xmath14 ) . within the hartree approximation",

    "all results are ensemble averages over 100 simulations .    if @xmath22 , the @xmath23 symmetry is explicitly broken . when @xmath24 , the potential is a symmetric double - well ( sdw ) , with two degenerate minima .",
    "this is the first case we consider .",
    "at @xmath25 , the quench amounts to switching from a single to a double well with the field initially localized at @xmath13 . in fig .",

    "@xcite , the quench sets oscillations in the field s zero mode , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the volume ( or area in 2d ) .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is controlled by the temperature of the initial gaussian distribution , as explained above .",
    "in fact , temperature here is simply a convenient way to set an initial gaussian distribution in momentum space .",
    "we did this using a langevin equation with white noise .",
    "one could state that the field is at @xmath28 but initially set with a gaussian distribution in momentum space with a certain width .",
    "this width is a measure of the initial `` temperature '' of the system .    at early times",

    "note that this is very distinct from spinodal decomposition , where competing domains of the two phases coarsen @xcite .",

    "@xcite . here",
    ", it is enough to mention that oscillons are long - lived , time - dependent , localized field configurations which express local ordering of momentum modes . what was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that after the quench oscillons emerge in synchrony , exhibiting both spatial and time ordering . in figure [ oscillons_count ]",

    "@xmath40 attains its maximum ( @xmath44 on a lattice with @xmath45 degrees of freedom ) when equipartition is satisfied .",
    "this occurs both at the initial thermalization @xmath46 and final equilibrium states , since in this case all modes carry the same fractional kinetic energy . in fig .",

    "also shown ( solid line ) is the average between successive peaks of @xmath40 , with a plateau at approximately @xmath51 that coincides with the maximum oscillon presence in the system .",
    "thus , oscillon configurations serve as early bottlenecks to equipartition , temporarily suppressing the diffusion of energy from low ( @xmath52 ) to higher modes .     from the initial state for closed systems at @xmath38 .",
    "the exponential approach to equilibrium is clear at late times .",
    "the inset illustrates the role of oscillons as a bottleneck to equipartition.,width=288 ]",
    "for @xmath53 the potential is asymmetric with the minimum at @xmath13 becoming metastable .",
    "we proceed as before by quenching the system from a single well , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ asympot ] .      as before , oscillons will once again be nucleated .",
    "however , the situation now changes dramatically .",
    "due to the asymmetry , the system will decay into the global minimum at @xmath54 .",
    "we have observed that this decay may occur in three possible ways depending on the initial temperature @xmath14 and the value of @xmath6 @xcite : i ) the transition to the global minimum happens very fast in what can be called a `` cross - over '' transition ; ii ) the transition occurs as a single oscillon becomes unstable and grows into a critical bubble . as is well know from the theory of first order phase transitions @xcite , once a critical nucleus forms it will grow to complete the transition ; iii ) two or more oscillons coalesce to become a critical bubble that then grows to complete the transition .    in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we fixed the temperature to be @xmath55 . from the hartree potential of eq .",
    "[ veff ] , one can see that for large temperatures the potential becomes a single well again . for @xmath32",
    "no oscillons are nucleated after the quench . in this case",
    ", we expect that the usual metastable decay rate based on the theory of homogeneous nucleation ( hn ) will apply , becoming more accurate for smaller @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "however , a quick glance at the time axis shows the fast decay time - scale , of order @xmath65 . for comparison , for @xmath66 , hn would predict nucleation time - scales of order @xmath67\\geq 10^{12}$ ] ( in dimensionless units ) .",
    "[ the related nucleation barriers with the effective potential are @xmath68 and @xmath69 . ] for small asymmetries @xmath30 displays similar oscillatory behavior to the sdw case before transitioning to the global minimum .",
    "as @xmath6 is increased the number of oscillations decreases . for large asymmetries , @xmath70 , the entire field crosses over to the global minimum without any nucleation event , resulting in oscillations about the global minimum .",
    "this is the situation described in case i ) above .      in fig .",
    "[ powerlaw ] we show the ensemble - averaged nucleation time - scales for resonant nucleation , @xmath73 , as a function of the nucleation barrier ( computed with eq . [ veff ] ) , @xmath74 , for the temperatures @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
