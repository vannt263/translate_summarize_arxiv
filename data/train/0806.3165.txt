    "one important clue about the nature of quantum gravity is that the einstein field equation and quantum field theory in curved spacetime imply that black holes behave as thermodynamical objects consistent with the four laws of thermodynamics .",
    "they are endowed with an entropy proportional to the cross - sectional area of the event horizon @xcite and a temperature due to quantum hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "although this interplay of gravitation , quantum field theory , and thermodynamics has been a focus of research for over 30 years , it has yet to be completely understood .",
    "one fascinating idea was the proposal by jacobson @xcite to reverse the logic of black hole thermodynamics and derive the einstein equations as a consequence of spacetime thermodynamics and quantum field theory .",
    "the idea is that the local acceleration horizons that exist through every point in spacetime are analogous to tiny pieces of a black hole event horizon and have an entropy proportional to their area .",
    "the equivalence principle is then invoked to view the local neighborhood around any point in a general curved spacetime as a piece of flat spacetime . even in flat spacetime accelerated observers can never receive information from certain regions . for these observers , quantum fields",
    "are localized to the rindler wedge of flat spacetime and they view the usual minkowski vacuum as precisely a thermal state @xcite .",
    "this supplies the notion of a local temperature . by demanding the clausius relation @xmath7 at every point , where @xmath2 is the flow of energy across the horizon and",
    "@xmath3 is the unruh temperature , jacobson was able to show the einstein equation appears as an equation of state .",
    "this derivation supports the idea that macroscopic spacetime dynamics is just the thermodynamics of the quantum vacuum . in the past several years other related",
    "work has shown that in certain spacetimes ( spherically symmetric , axisymmetric , and cosmological ) the gravitational field equations near a horizon can also be re - expressed as the thermodynamic identity @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these results have deep implications , but their true significance ( if any ) is not yet clear .",
    "recently , in order to probe jacobson s derivation further , a horizon entropy proportional to a function of the ricci scalar was considered @xcite .",
    "the idea was to determine whether higher curvature correction terms that one expects from effective field theory to appear in the gravitational field equation ( or action ) can be derived from the thermodynamical prescription .",
    "it was found that the field equations of @xmath9 gravity can be derived only if the setting is shifted from equilibrium to non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "an extra internal entropy production term proportional to the squared expansion of the horizon is required for the clausius relation ( or now more properly the _ entropy balance law _ ) to hold .",
    "perhaps more importantly , it was realized that the original derivation of the einstein equation via an area entropy can be easily generalized to a non - equilibrium setting . in this case",
    "an entropy production term proportional to the squared shear of the horizon appears when the entropy balance law holds .",
    "consistency with the einstein equation requires that the ratio of the shear term coefficient to area entropy density be @xmath10 . ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the meaning of these additional terms .",
    "the existence of entropy production terms proportional to squared shear and expansion is reminiscent of the shear and bulk viscosity terms that appear in viscous fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "a connection between horizon dynamics and fluid dynamics was first noticed by damour @xcite . in the 1980 s price , thorne , and",
    "collaborators further developed this picture into the black hole ",
    "membrane paradigm \" @xcite , using a timelike _ stretched horizon _ to approximate the null horizon .",
    "the shear and expansion of the horizon also appear in the membrane paradigm , where they are interpreted to be viscous terms in the law describing how the horizon area / entropy changes .",
    "however , this interpretation is just an analogy and it is not clear if there is a deep relationship between the dynamics of causal horizons and hydrodynamics .",
    "if there is a relationship we must not only understand horizons as a fluid system , but also the physics of this system must be consistent with hydrodynamics as an effective theory . in hydrodynamics , viscosities are phenomenological coefficients in the linear constitutive relations between fluxes of momentum in the fluid and the thermodynamic  forces \" given by gradients of the fluid velocity",
    ". these velocity gradients must be small ( both in space and time ) compared to some microscopic scale for hydrodynamics to be an accurate description of the near - equilibrium physics .",
    "after reviewing the thermodynamic derivation in detail we will show that it can be consistently reformulated in the language of hydrodynamics .",
    "we argue the minkowski vacuum , which is a thermal state when localized in the rindler wedge of spacetime , is holographic @xcite ; its properties are encoded into the 2 + 1 dimensional system near the rindler horizon .",
    "this is because the degrees of freedom in this thermal atmosphere are essentially piled up near the horizon boundary .",
    "the velocity and temperature gradients associated with these degrees of freedom can be made small enough so that hydrodynamics is the appropriate effective theory .",
    "therefore we think of these thermal atmosphere degrees of freedom as a fluid living on a stretched horizon approximating the local acceleration horizon . using hydrodynamics and the properties of the stretched horizon",
    ", we will derive the entropy balance law postulated in @xcite , showing that it is appropriate to interpret the coefficients of the shear and expansion terms in this law as shear and bulk viscosities respectively .",
    "just as in the thermodynamic derivation , the entropy balance law requires that spacetime dynamics is governed by the einstein equation and that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is @xmath10 . therefore in this more general formulation einstein s equation",
    "is a consequence of the hydrodynamics of spacetime vacuum .",
    "the value @xmath10 has attracted considerable attention over the past few years from work on the celebrated anti - de sitter ( ads ) /conformal field theory ( cft ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "this correspondence states that certain gauge theories in flat spacetime are equivalent to a quantum gravity theory in a higher dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "hydrodynamics arises as the description for the dynamics of long wavelength perturbations about equilibrium in high temperature gauge theory plasmas .",
    "working on the gravity side of the duality it has been found that @xmath10 is the value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio for all gauge theories with an einstein gravity dual @xcite .",
    "kovtun , son , and starinets conjectured that these theories may saturate a universal lower bound on the ratio @xcite , but the true significance of the ratio is unclear and the existence of a viscosity bound is controversial @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is not clear why the ratio , derived using relativistic field theories , is independent of the speed of light @xmath11 . similarly ,",
    "if gravity is somehow involved in saturation of the bound , why does @xmath12 not appear ?    here , since the ratio holds universally for any local acceleration horizon , it appears more fundamental than previous results involving ads spacetimes .",
    "it seems that @xmath10 is the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the local vacuum as a thermal state .",
    "we discuss the significance of this result and its connection to the gauge / gravity literature .",
    "we conclude by examining open questions and possible extensions of our work .",
    "we now review the derivation  @xcite of the einstein equation as the equation of state arising from the thermodynamics of local horizons .",
    "the motivating idea is that the origin of the thermodynamic behavior of black holes is rooted in the thermodynamic behavior of the local vacuum . in minkowski spacetime",
    "when quantum fields are restricted to a rindler wedge @xmath13 , the vacuum density matrix takes the form of a thermal state @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "notice that neither the  boost hamiltonian \" @xmath15 nor  boost temperature \" @xmath16 have dimensions of energy .",
    "this is because @xmath15 generates translations of dimensionless hyperbolic boost angle .",
    "when @xmath15 is rescaled to generate proper time along a worldline with proper acceleration @xmath17 , @xmath18 is rescaled to the usual unruh temperature @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the null surface @xmath20 forming the edge of the rindler wedge is one part of the boundary of the past for the bifurcation plane @xmath21 , and therefore acts as a causal horizon .",
    "accelerated observers in the rindler wedge can only access information on spacelike slices bounded by the bifurcation plane . since vacuum fluctuations are correlated between the inside and outside of the wedge , these observers will see an entanglement entropy . in a continuum field theory",
    "this entropy scales with the area of the boundary , but is divergent because of the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence in the density of states .",
    "when a uv regulator is introduced the entropy is proportional to the area of a horizon cross - section , with a proportionality constant that could depend on the nature and number of the quantum fields @xcite .",
    "this motivates jacobson s assumption of a universal entropy density @xmath22 per unit horizon area , with @xmath22 possibly dependent on the field content .",
    "a horizon entropy @xmath23 will be contributed by a little horizon patch of area @xmath24 .    when the thermal density matrix @xmath25 at temperature @xmath18 is perturbed , the change in entanglement entropy is related to the change in mean energy via ds = /t_b .",
    "because the change in the mean energy is due to the flux into the unobservable region of spacetime , which is perfectly thermalized by the horizon system , it is assumed to consist entirely of heat .",
    "thus , we have the thermodynamic clausius relation @xmath26 .",
    "jacobson s second assumption was this relation should hold for all causal horizons , with @xmath2 as the flow of boost energy across the horizon and @xmath1 the change in area entropy .",
    "since the area of the horizon is no longer fixed , the spacetime must become dynamical .",
    "now that the spacetime is no longer flat everywhere a _ local _",
    "horizon is defined in analogy with a black hole horizon .",
    "a global definition of the latter is the boundary of the past of future null infinity .",
    "the segment of a black hole horizon to the past of a spatial cross - section is the boundary of the past of that cross section .",
    "a local horizon at a point @xmath27 is defined in a similar way : choose a spacelike 2-surface patch @xmath28 including @xmath27 , and choose one side of the boundary of the past of @xmath28 . near @xmath27",
    "this boundary is a congruence of null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath28 .",
    "these comprise the horizon .    at @xmath27",
    "one can invoke the equivalence principle to view the spacetime in the neighborhood of @xmath27 as approximately flat . in this small patch",
    "the idea is to construct a future pointing approximate boost killing vector @xmath29 that vanishes at @xmath27 and whose flow leaves the tangent plane to @xmath28 at @xmath27 invariant .",
    "the normalization of @xmath29 is chosen so that @xmath30 .",
    "the construction can be done explicitly by solving killing s equation @xmath31 order by order in riemann normal coordinates @xmath32 .",
    "eventually , at @xmath33 , no solution exists because a general curved spacetime has no killing vectors . up to this ambiguity",
    ", our notion of time along the horizon is given by the parameter @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "this killing time is related to the affine parameter along the horizon generators by @xmath36 , so the point @xmath27 is located at infinite killing time and @xmath37 .",
    "the expansion @xmath38 and shear @xmath39 of the horizon in terms of killing time are related to the expansion @xmath40 and shear @xmath41 in affine time as follows = e^-v = - ,   = e^-v = - .",
    "[ falloff]thus , the killing expansion and shear vanish at @xmath27 ( as long as the affine quantities are not diverging ) and the horizon area is instantaneously stationary at this point .",
    "this defines our notion of equilibrium .",
    "the system is defined as the degrees of freedom just behind the horizon and we will consider transitions that terminate in the equilibrium state at @xmath27 .",
    "we define the heat as the flux of the boost energy current of matter across the horizon , q = t^m_^d^ , where @xmath42 is the matter stress tensor .",
    "this and all subsequent integrals are taken over a thin pencil of horizon generators centered on the one that terminates at @xmath27",
    ". it will be convenient to work in terms of affine parameter and the affinely parameterized horizon tangent vector @xmath43 . using the relation @xmath44 and the definition of @xmath18 we thus have = t^m _ k^k^(- ) dd^2a .",
    "[ dq / t ] to compute the entropy change @xmath23 we must follow the area change of the horizon , a = d d^2a , [ da ] where @xmath45 is the expansion of the congruence of null geodesics generating the horizon . using the raychaudhuri equation = -^2-_^-r_k^k^[ray]the entropy change",
    "is thus given up to @xmath46 by s = s   dd^2a , [ ds]where all quantities in the integrand are evaluated at @xmath27 .",

    "on the other hand , if it is required that @xmath49 at all points @xmath27 and for all null vectors @xmath43 , we first find that the affine expansion at @xmath27 must vanish since the heat flux ( [ dq / t ] ) vanishes at @xmath27 . at @xmath50",
    "the integrands of ( [ dq / t ] ) and ( [ ds ] ) then imply ( 2/ ) t^m_k^k^= s  ( _ ^+ r_k^k^ ) .",
    "[ clausiusfinal]note that the shear squared term can be written in terms of derivatives of @xmath43 , which can be independently chosen at @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the @xmath43 derivative part of ( [ clausiusfinal ] ) implies the shear must also vanish at @xmath27 if the clausius relation is to hold .",
    "however , ( [ falloff ] ) tells us the shear and expansion with respect to killing time fall off to zero at @xmath27 as @xmath51 when @xmath40 and @xmath41 vanish , while only as @xmath52 when @xmath40 and @xmath41 are non vanishing . in @xcite",
    "it was hypothesized that for a slower approach to equilibrium the clausius relation may not apply and thus @xmath53 . in this case",
    "there is an entropy balance law ds = q / t_b+d_i s [ balance]where @xmath4 represents internal entropy production for a system out of equilibrium .",

    "we also assume that @xmath4 depends only on squared gradients of @xmath43 .",

    "as noted above , the shear squared entropy production term ( [ shearprod ] ) is very similar to the entropy production term due to the shear of the fluid flow in viscous hydrodynamics .",

    "the shear in ( [ shearprod ] ) is a gradient of a null horizon tangent vector .",

    "it turns out the answers to these questions are in the affirmative and it is possible to _ derive _ the entropy balance law and entropy production term we postulated in ( [ balance ] ) and ( [ shearprod ] ) from hydrodynamics . before we start , it will be necessary to briefly review ( relativistic ) hydrodynamics .    in modern terminology , hydrodynamics is an effective theory describing the dynamics of perturbations about an equilibrium state on long length scales .",

    "this form of the stress tensor alone is not sufficient to determine the dynamics .",
    "however , if @xmath71 and @xmath72 are @xmath73 , the dissipative part of the stress tensor @xmath70 is smaller than the zeroth order perfect fluid part and can be expanded in terms of the derivatives of the fluid velocity . at each point",

    "but the technical drawback is the horizon is a null surface and @xmath43 is a null vector instead of being unit timelike .",
    "however , we can employ the notion of a stretched horizon pioneered by price and thorne to describe the physics of globally defined black hole event horizons @xcite .",
    "the stretched horizon is a timelike surface that lives close enough to the event horizon that it can capture its essential physics .",

    "( [ vectorlimit ] ) implies that the gradient has the form _",
    "l^. thus , we need @xmath136 where now @xmath137 for horizon killing time @xmath34 .",
    "this criterion is clearly satisfied for derivatives in @xmath34 .",
    "this can be seen because the local equilibration time for the system is @xmath138 , while the process is assumed to occur for an _ infinite _ amount of killing time before terminating in the equilibrium state .",
    "furthermore in section [ thermo ] there was no requirement on the size of the changes in @xmath139 directions of the horizon fluid .",
    "the stretched horizon cross - section at @xmath140 ( or equivalently the 2-surface @xmath28 as @xmath94 ) can be tuned so that the changes in @xmath141 and @xmath142 are @xmath143 near @xmath27 .",
    "thus , there is no obstruction to working in the hydrodynamic regime and therefore an order by order expansion in derivatives is justified . in the next subsection",
    "we will use the equations of hydrodynamics and the properties of stretched horizons to derive the near - equilibrium entropy balance law ( [ balance ] ) postulated in section [ thermo ] .      following our above review of hydrodynamics",
    ", we can proceed to add a dissipative part to the perfect fluid stress tensor ( [ stress ] ) and expand it in derivatives of the flow velocity . using conservation of the stress tensor in the stretched horizon , the thermodynamic relations @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath118 , and making the gauge choice @xmath146 , it follows @xcite that entropy balance law for the horizon fluid is    _ ( s u^ ) = + _ ^ + ^2 , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the clausius term is the flux of bulk matter energy into the fluid as heat .",
    "we will see below that the entropy change on the left hand side of this equation is a finite quantity ; the ratios of the divergent quantities on the right hand side will be finite .    integrating over a volume in the horizon fluid",
    "we find _ ( s u^ )  dd^2a = dd^2a[entropybal1]using stokes theorem on the left hand side and then taking the limit @xmath94 along with ( [ vectorlimit ] ) yields s(v ) = dv d^2a , [ entropybal2]where the @xmath39 and @xmath38 are now the expansion and shear of the null @xmath98 .",
    "notice how the @xmath83 s have also canceled out of the right hand side and the relativistic entropy balance law ( [ entropybal1 ] ) has been reduced to a non - relativistic form in the true horizon limit , with the left hand side just a change in total entropy in killing time .",
    "this result agrees with the equation for the  long - time \" evolution of black hole entropy in the membrane paradigm @xcite , if we identify @xmath149 as a hawking temperature . what is new here is the conceptual picture of ( [ entropybal2 ] ) as a consequence of relativistic hydrodynamics",
    "this is not present in the damour - price - thorne membrane paradigm because no hydrodynamic limit was identified . , where @xmath150 the hawking temperature .",
    "the schwarzschild radius @xmath151 is the characteristic size of the system .",
    "spatial gradients of velocity necessarily scale as @xmath152 so there can be no hydrodynamic limit .",
    "] thus , @xmath54 and @xmath77 are not just analogous to viscosities ; in our framework it is consistent to identify them as the shear and bulk viscosity of the horizon fluid .",
    "working with the bifurcation point parameterized as @xmath153 is not convenient ; therefore we change to the affine parameter @xmath154 so that @xmath27 is at the origin : @xmath155 and @xmath121 . using the relations @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 ,",
    "yields s( ) = -    dd^2a , [ entropybal2]which is consistent with the form of the entropy balance law ( [ balance ] ) written in terms of horizon quantities .",
    "the matter stress tensor term is the expected flux of boost energy , while the viscous terms form the internal production piece @xmath4 .",
    "notice that in general the horizon bulk viscosity @xmath77 also appears in addition to the shear viscosity @xmath54 .",
    "we can now proceed to expand the left hand side of ( [ entropybal2 ] ) order by order in @xmath48 just as in the original thermodynamic derivation discussed at the end of in section [ thermo ] , assuming that the entropy density @xmath159 is an undetermined quantity such that @xmath160 . at zeroth order the affine expansion at @xmath27 is again required to be zero . demanding the linear order equation hold for all null @xmath161 and at any arbitrary point @xmath27 in spacetime , along with local conservation of the bulk matter tensor @xmath162 yields the einstein equation and @xmath22 equal to @xmath163 .",
    "thus the uv cutoff length is fixed to be @xmath164 .",
    "the extra shear term in the area change that comes from the raychaudhuri equation ( [ ray ] ) is consistent with the balance law only if the shear viscosity to entropy density is @xmath165 , just like in the thermodynamical argument .",
    "the bulk viscosity @xmath77 is not determined by the balance law at this order because the affine expansion must be zero at @xmath27 .",
    "we now conclude with some remarks on the meaning and possible implications of these results .",
    "first , to summarize , we argued that the thermodynamic derivation of the einstein field equations can consistently be reformulated using hydrodynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom for the local vacuum state are associated with local acceleration horizons through any point .",
    "these are closely approximated by surrogate timelike stretched horizons and can be thought of as 2 + 1 dimensional fluids .",
    "the equivalence principle is invoked to view the neighborhood of each point as a piece of flat spacetime with a local rindler horizon .",
    "the entropy of these horizons is fixed and they describe local equilibrium for the horizon fluid .",
    "the unruh effect is then used to effectively assign these equilibrium states a local temperature in the limit where the stretched horizon approaches the true one . on length scales much larger than the mean free path",
    ", hydrodynamics must be an accurate description of the physics .",
    "when the horizon fluid is out of the equilibrium state , entropy is produced , the horizon area is no longer fixed , and the spacetime can no longer be flat .",
    "the entropy balance law is then re - derived using the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "together with the local conservation of bulk energy - momentum , the balance law implies entropy changes must be governed by the einstein equation .",
    "the einstein equation thus arises from the hydrodynamics of the local vacuum .",
    "remarkably , this argument also fixes the entropy density and shear viscosity of the vacuum such that their ratio is @xmath10 .",
    "our picture seems to imply that microscopic dynamics ( which could include quantum gravity below the cutoff ) leads to ( semi-)classical einstein gravity as collective hydrodynamic behavior at low energies .",
    "some ideas in the same spirit can be found in @xcite .",
    "what is interesting here is that some hydrodynamic properties turn out to be universal although we initially allowed for the properties of the horizon fluid to depend on the number and nature of the quantum fields and treated the viscosities as being purely phenomenological .",
    "once the value of the the uv cutoff scale @xmath101 was fixed to be roughly a planck length , the entropy density associated with all local rindler horizons is the bekenstein - hawking entropy density and @xmath166 is universally @xmath5 .",
    "all the dependence on the number and nature of the quantum fields is apparently absorbed into the low energy newton constant @xmath12 .",
    "this in accord with arguments that the bekenstein - hawking entropy is dependent implicitly on the nature of quantum fields through the renormalization of the gravitational constant and is either partly or wholly the entanglement entropy of the thermal atmosphere @xcite .",
    "these results are puzzling here since no knowledge of microscopic physics was needed to obtain them , only the balance law .",
    "we did , on the other hand , fix the value of cutoff scale to be the planck length  experimentally \" by requiring the einstein equation inferred from the entropy balance law to agree with the observed einstein equation . low energy physics ( the balance law ) and this one observation turn out to be enough to determine the entropy density and the shear viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the bulk viscosity though is one fluid property not fixed by the balance law in this case and therefore it seems one would have to know about the details of the microscopic physics in order to determine it .    as we noted in the introduction @xmath10",
    "also appears in the ads / cft literature as the universal value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of gauge theories with an einstein gravity dual .",
    "could this be merely a coincidence or is there a connection between this gauge / gravity duality result and our hydrodynamic derivation ?",
    "first , in both cases holography is crucial : we postulated the thermal vacuum state is holographic , while ads / cft is a precise realization of the equivalence of a higher dimensional gravity theory to a lower dimensional non - gravitational theory on a boundary .",
    "furthermore , in the duality , @xmath167 dimensional gauge theories in high temperature deconfining phases are dual to large black hole or black brane spacetimes in @xmath168 ads @xcite",
    ". therefore one can use classical perturbations of the large black hole or black brane spacetimes ( see @xcite for a review ) to perform analytical computations of the hydrodynamic transport coefficients .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary the notion of viscosity is meaningful in the infrared regime of the gauge theory , which corresponds to the near horizon limit of the translationally invariant black object . in this sense",
    "these black objects have viscosities , just like the viscosity we found for local stretched horizons .",
    "in both cases the hydrodynamics of a flat spacetime system is manifested in the dynamics of a horizon boundary . however , since @xmath10 holds for all local acceleration horizons it seems more fundamental than the ads / cft results for large black holes and black branes in ads spacetimes .",
    "the dynamics of the local vacuum is governed by gravity itself in the form of einstein s equations at each point in an arbitrary spacetime , while the gauge theory dynamics is encoded in the perturbation theory about an ads gravity background .    in the duality the @xmath10 result holds for both conformal and non - conformal gauge theories .",
    "the common feature is strong coupling , in particular very large t hooft coupling . in general the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of a gauge theory",
    "depends on the value of the t hooft coupling @xcite . for weakly coupled theories",
    "there is a large separation between the mean free path and any other microscopic scale , for example a thermal de broglie wavelength . in this intermediate region",
    "we can use a kinetic theory description where viscosity is due to momentum transfer by quasiparticle motion .",
    "larger mean free paths correspond to an easier momentum transfer and higher viscosity . as the coupling is tuned up the viscosity decreases and the kinetic theory description begins to break down .",
    "nevertheless , extrapolating all the way to strong coupling correctly indicates @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint suggests the dynamics of the local vacuum thermal state should also be strongly coupled in some sense .",
    "in fact , using the results of section [ balancelaw ] we can argue this is the case . from @xmath165 , we can roughly determine the other undetermined parameter in our analysis : the dimensionless parameter @xmath170 in the mean free path .",
    "first , from kinetic theory we can estimate @xmath171 . using @xmath172 and @xmath159 for the thermal state",
    ", this implies that ~. [ coupling ] thus , consistency with the entropy balance law implies the mean free path @xmath173 is of order the uv cutoff scale @xmath101 . since @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the local temperature at the cutoff",
    ", we find that @xmath170 must be roughly of order unity .",
    "we can think of the dimensionless parameter @xmath134 in @xmath176 as a coupling which controls the size of the mean free path compared to the microscopic scale ( here the uv cutoff scale ) . if @xmath177 the mean free path would be much larger than the uv cutoff length and the ratio much larger than @xmath178 .",
    "however the hydrodynamic derivation requires @xmath179 and @xmath180 , which is indicative of strong coupling .",
    "typically one would not consider the local vacuum thermal state a strongly coupled system .",
    "for example , the vacuum fluctuations of a free field do not appear to be strongly coupled .",
    "on the other hand , a free ( scalar , for example ) field theory in flat spacetime is a continuum field theory and has infinite entanglement entropy .",
    "this conflicts with the requirement of a finite entropy and a non - zero cutoff that allowed us to derive the entropy balance law .",
    "the balance law implies we must have backreaction effects that distort the flat background spacetime .",
    "these gravitational dynamics are imposed up to the uv cutoff , where the physics is strongly coupled . in this regime",
    "the entropy density and shear viscosity are universal constants proportional to one another .",
    "since the bulk viscosity is not determined , it may depend on the field content . if this is the case it would be similar to a non - conformal gauge theory , where the bulk viscosity is determined by the mass scales associated with the particular fields that break the conformal symmetry .",
    "since our picture of the local vacuum thermal state and its dynamics is consistent with key aspects of the gauge / gravity dualities , perhaps it can provide a new perspective on the puzzling aspects of the @xmath10 ratio .",
    "for example , although the ratio is derived for relativistic field theories , it is independent of the speed of light @xmath11 ( when we return to cgs dimensions ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic derivation indicates the ratio is tied crucially to the physics of null horizons .",
    "as we noticed in ( [ entropybal2 ] ) the entropy balance law for the local acceleration horizon reduces to a non - relativistic form .",
    "the same type of behavior was first noticed in the membrane paradigm @xcite , where the behavior of a black hole event horizon is analogous to non - relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "intuitively , the value of the speed of light should not affect the behavior of the intrinsically ultra - relativistic degrees of freedom living on the stretched horizon boundary surface .",
    "an important open question is whether @xmath10 is a universal bound on the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio for all systems , even those that are non - relativistic .",
    "experimental data and the fact that viscosity is larger than @xmath181 for weakly coupled systems indicate the bound is plausible @xcite . it is curious that the conjectured bound is independent of @xmath12 even though it is saturated in the special class of theories with a gravity dual .",
    "however , in the hydrodynamic derivation we relied only the general thermal properties of the minkowski vacuum .",
    "@xmath12 only appears ( in the planck length ) when we require agreement with the experiment and fix @xmath164 .",
    "this indicates that the bound , if it exists , may be a consequence of the behavior of quantum fields when they are localized into regions of flat spacetime .",
    "the conjectured bound may also be related to the bekenstein entropy bound @xcite , a result also first derived in a gravitational setting , yet which ultimately does not depend on @xmath12 .    in the future",
    "it would be interesting to consider higher curvature corrections to the assumed entropy density and compare the results for the viscosities to the gauge / gravity literature .",
    "for example , in the case where the acceleration horizon entropy density is assumed to be a ( non - constant , polynomial ) function of the ricci scalar @xmath9 it was found previously that @xmath165 , while the bulk viscosity ratio is @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "corresponding results in the duality would require study of corrections to non - conformal gauge theories , although an exact comparison is complicated by our inability to determine the bulk viscosity even when an area entropy is assumed . in ads",
    "/ cft , general corrections to einstein gravity involving contractions of the ricci and riemann tensors were found to modify the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio at strong t hooft coupling . with a choice of one parameter",
    "the ratio can now be less than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a comparison here would require assuming the local horizon has an entropy density proportional to these contractions and checking the effects in the entropy balance law ( [ entropybal2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we have only considered linearized hydrodynamics , which was sufficient to derive the einstein equations and fix the shear viscosity of the local rindler stretched horizon .",
    "however , @xcite recently showed the form of the hydrodynamic stress tensor on the ads boundary is determined up to 2nd order in derivatives by demanding the einstein equations ( with negative cosmological constant ) hold for perturbations about black brane spacetimes .",
    "the procedure is roughly the inverse of our hydrodynamic derivation : instead of starting with the hydrodynamics of local rindler stretched horizon and deriving einstein s equations , they impose einstein s equation order by order in a derivative expansion to derive the stress - tensor at the ads boundary .",
    "the resulting perturbative metrics are dual to solutions of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the set of hydrodynamic coefficients at the next order in the stress tensor characterize relaxation times @xcite .",
    "in our case it would be interesting to see whether higher derivative terms in the stress tensor of the local rindler stretched horizon can be meaningfully defined and fixed by the entropy balance law .",
