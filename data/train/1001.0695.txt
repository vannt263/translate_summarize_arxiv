    ", the geodesic diameter has been extensively studied and fully understood .",

    "hershberger and suri  @xcite showed that the diameter can be computed in linear time using their fast matrix search technique .    on the other hand , to the best of our knowledge , no algorithm for computing @xmath15 has yet been discovered when @xmath6 is a polygonal domain having one or more holes @xmath20 .",

    "this fairly wide gap between simple polygons and polygonal domains is seemingly due to the uniqueness of the shortest path between any two points ; it is well known that there is a unique shortest path between any two points in a simple polygon  @xcite . using this uniqueness",
    ", one can show that the diameter is indeed realized by a pair of corners in @xmath7 ; that is , @xmath23 if @xmath2  @xcite . for general polygonal domains with @xmath24 , however , this is not the case . in this paper",
    ", we exhibit several examples where the diameter is realized by non - corner points on @xmath9 or even by interior points of @xmath6 .",
    "( see  [ fig : examples1 ] and appendix a. ) this observation also shows an immediate difficulty in devising any exhaustive algorithm since the search space like @xmath9 or the whole domain @xmath6 is not discrete .",
    "the status of the geodesic center problem is also similar .",
    "the _ geodesic center _ is defined to be a point in @xmath6 that minimizes the maximum geodesic distance from it to any other point of @xmath6 .",

    "as with the diameter problem , there is no known algorithm for general polygonal domains .",
    "note that computing the geodesic center involves computing the geodesic diameter because the geodesic center may be determined by the midpoint of a shortest path defining the geodesic diameter .",
    "see orourke and suri  @xcite and mitchell  @xcite for more references on the geodesic diameter / center problem in simple polygons and polygonal domains . since the geodesic diameter / center of a simple polygon",
    "is determined by its corners , one can exploit the _",
    "geodesic farthest - site voronoi diagram _ of the corners @xmath7 to compute the diameter / center , which can be built in @xmath26 time  @xcite .",

    "our new geometric results underlying the algorithms indeed show that the existence of any diametral pair consisting of non - corner points implies multiple shortest paths between the pair ; as one of the cases , it is shown that _ if @xmath17 is a diametral pair and both @xmath44 and @xmath45 lie in the interior of @xmath6 , then there are at least five shortest paths between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . _ some analogies between polygonal domains and convex polytopes in @xmath46 can be seen . orourke and",
    "schevon  @xcite proved that if the geodesic diameter on a convex @xmath47-polytope is realized by two non - corner points , at least five shortest paths exist between the two .",
    "based on this observation , they presented an @xmath48-time algorithm for computing the geodesic diameter on a convex @xmath47-polytope .",

    "note that some portion or the whole of a feasible path may go along the boundary @xmath9 .",
    "the _ length _ of a path is the sum of the euclidean lengths of its segments .",
