    "the highest @xmath25 criterion was found to lead simultaneously to layers with maximized uniformity and minimized compensation by unintentional impurities and defects .",
    "the nominal doping @xmath11 spans a wide range from non - ferromagnetic insulating materials with @xmath10 to the highest @xmath25 materials with @xmath26 . within this nominal mn doping range and for film thicknesses smaller than approximately 50  nm and larger than 10  nm in case of higher doped samples with @xmath27",
    ", we obtained a series of ( ga , mn)as materials with reproducible characteristics . they show an overall trend of increasing saturation moment ( ascribed to substitutional mn@xmath0 ) with increasing @xmath11 , increasing @xmath25 , and increasing hole density .",
    "the materials have no apparent charge or moment compensation of the substitutional mn@xmath0 impurities and have a large degree of uniformity reflected by sharp magnetic and transport singularities at @xmath25 .    because experimentally it is difficult to determine on a precise quantitative level all relevant parameters of a given material and also because accurate quantitative theoretical modeling of even an idealized ( ga , mn)as is not feasible we are convinced that a meaningful examination of intrinsic properties of ( ga , mn)as ferromagnetic semiconductor materials should be performed on the level of qualitative or at most semi - quantitative trends observed over a wide doping range in a consistent set of materials .",
    "our series of epilayers represents an attempt to provide such an experimental basis .",
    "the optimization of the materials in the series , which is performed individually for each nominal doping , minimizes the uncertainties in the experimental sample parameters and produces high quality epilayers which are as close as possible to to uniform uncompensated ( ga , mn)as mixed crystals . we prefer this method for studying the doping trends over , e.g. , comparisons of as - grown and annealed samples because the as - grown state of a sample is not well defined ; the characteristics of as - grown samples are not well reproducible , the materials are less uniform and can have a large number of unintentional interstitial mn impurities which can compensate both the local moment and holes produced by mn@xmath0 and whose density is difficult to measure accurately .",
    "similarly , the approach based on individual optimization at each nominal doping provides a qualitatively better control over the whole set of sample parameters and therefore a better approximation to idealized ( ga , mn)as materials than the combinatorial method which on one physical wafer produces a wide range of samples due to the stoichiometry gradients across the wafer imposed during a single growth experiment . for further discussion highlighting the importance of the individual optimization of material synthesis at each nominal doping",

    "the growths were done in a veeco gen ii molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) system .",
    "we used 2-inch semi - insulating 0.5  mm thick gaas substrates mounted on a molybdenum in - free sample holder by mechanically fixing the sample at the edges .",
    "each growth started by a standard high - temperature grown gaas buffer of about 200 nm thickness .",
    "after the growth interruption the substrate was cooled down for the low - temperature growth of ( ga , mn)as ; during the cooling period the as source was closed when the substrate temperature dropped below 400@xmath28c .",
    "the ( ga , mn)as layers were grown at the growth rate of 0.2 monolayers / second , corresponding to temperatures of 940@xmath28 and 920@xmath28c at the tip and the base zone , respectively , of the dual filament ga source . the mn flux , and thence @xmath11 , was determined by measuring the ratio of the beam equivalent pressures ( bep ) of mn and ga sources before each growth . the mn content was cross - checked on several samples by secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) and by comparing the growth rates of gaas and ( ga , mn)as ; the results of the three methods agreed within @xmath29 . the bep - based method yields the best reproducibility and guarantees the correct ordering by increasing @xmath11 even though the relative uncertainty in @xmath11 may be large especially at low dopings .",
    "the arsenic was supplied by a valved cracker cell in the as@xmath30 regime ( cracking zone temperature 600@xmath31c ) .",
    "the as - to-(ga+mn ) flux ratio was calibrated using the as - controlled rheed intensity oscillations . for this purpose",
    "the substrate temperature was first set to 500@xmath31c .",
    "next , the as source was closed and the ga shutter was simultaneously opened for 30  40  s allowing accumulation of several ga monolayers on the substrate surface .",
    "after closing the ga shutter and re - opening the as source several growth oscillations were observed in the rheed image with period corresponding to the as flux .",
