    "the electromagnetic aspects of the proton and neutron structure are somewhat elusive .",
    "it is well known that the mass difference of proton and neutron is responsible for the stability of the universe ( the hydrogen atom would otherwise be unstable against beta decay into an electron - positron pair , a neutrino and a neutron ) .",
    "there have been attempts to explain the mass difference on the basis of the electromagnetic interaction among the constituent quarks  @xcite .",
    "a priori , one would think that the electrostatic interaction among the constituent quarks leads to an inversion of the mass hierarchy of proton versus neutron .",
    "namely , the coulomb interaction among valence quarks actually lowers the energy of the neutron as compared to the proton , as a naive counting argument shows .",
    "a hadron with valence quarks @xmath1 has interquark electromagnetic interactions proportional to the fractional charge numbers , @xmath2 whereas for the neutron with valence quarks @xmath3 , we have @xmath4 . the latter expression , being negative",
    ", would suggest that the neutron is lighter than the proton if the mass difference were of electromagnetic origin and due to coulomb exchange .    however , the radiative correction is not constrained to have any particular sign , and warrants further investigation especially because the electromagnetic wave functions of the valence quarks bound in an mit bag model  @xcite have a rather peculiar structure  @xcite and might give rise to significant radiative effects .",
    "the conclusion reached in refs .",
    "@xcite is that the electromagnetic self - energy of the quarks remains positive for all masses considered .",
    "thus , the quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) radiative energy shift can not explain the mass difference of proton and neutron , where a negative self - energy would otherwise be required in view of the larger fractional charge of the up as compared to the down quarks .    still",
    ", the investigations  @xcite as well as the proton radius conundrum  @xcite highlight the need for a closer look at the internal structure of the proton if one is interested in its own `` internal '' electromagnetic interactions , as well as the interactions of the proton with the `` outside world '' . if the interaction of the bound or scattered lepton with the proton is nonuniversal , then it is conceivable that the proton radius depends on the projectile particle .",
    "however , one can show that a number of perturbative higher - order effects which could appear to lead to such a nonuniversality of electron - proton versus muon - proton interactions are in fact absorbed into correction terms of known physical origin .",
    "let us consider electromagnetic interactions among the constituent particles of the proton , for example , a higher - order effect generated by a coupling of the scattered projectile ( electron or muon ) into a vacuum - polarization loop which in turn is inserted into a photon exchanged between two valence quarks .",
    "we here show that , because feynman propagators take care of all possible time orderings of virtual particle creation and annihilation processes , this effect actually constitutes a radiative correction to double scattering , and is absorbed , in lamb shift calculations , into the radiative correction to the proton s polarizability contribution to the lamb shift . a quantitative parametric estimate for",

    "let us consider the possible presence of light sea fermions as nonperturbative contributions to the proton s structure , inspired by a possible importance of virtual electron - positron pairs in the lepton nonuniversality in interactions with protons .",
    "we consider a thought experiment : if we switched off the electroweak interactions of quarks inside the proton , the resulting `` proton '' would of course be neutral but otherwise rather comparable in its mass and in its nuclear properties to a real proton with some nonperturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) `` wave function .

    "now , if we include back the electroweak interactions of quarks , virtual photons and electron - positron pairs would backreact on the previous `` wave function '' leading to a reshaping , and the actual `` proton wave function '' which now additionally contains photons and the electron - positron pairs .",

    "this density ( probability ) of electron - positron pairs , because of the inherently nonperturbative nature of qcd , is difficult if not impossible to quantitatively estimate , but its presence is not excluded by any known experiments . in fact , a significant photon content of the proton is well confirmed in the so - called deep inelastic compton scattering ( dics , see refs .",

    "in natural units , the photon annihilation diagram in the case of positronium leads to the effective interaction  @xcite @xmath56 this hamiltonian gives a nonvanishing interaction of the bound electron and the light sea positron if their spins add up to one . assuming that the electron - positron pairs within the proton are not polarized",
    ", we can replace @xmath57 after averaging over the polarizations of the sea leptons . for atomic ( electronic ) hydrogen ,",
    "the additional interaction of the electron with the proton due to the annihilation channel therefore is of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 measures the amount of electron - positron pairs within the proton . for muonic hydrogen",
