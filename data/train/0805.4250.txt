    "in the view of quantum theory , the time - energy uncertainty relation is interpreted as the limitation of how fast can a quantum system evolve from its initial state to an distinguishable state , equivalently , to an orthogonal state . in this relation , @xmath0 can be understood as the minimal evolving time between two distinct states of the quantum system . the time - energy uncertainty relation @xmath1 indicates the minimal evolving time is constrained by the energy spread of the system .",

    "following margolus - levitin theorem , once the average energy of the system is determined , the minimal evolving time between two distinct states is also determined .",
    "a quantum computer with every operation performed as quickly as the minimal evolving time has reached the maximum speed of the average energy .",
    "if we perceive the universe as such an quantum computer , as we already know the energy density and the age scale of the universe , we can work out the total operations performed by the universe from its beginning .",
    "this lead us to the third application , what is the accuracy of measuring the spacetime geometry ?",
    "a spacetime region can be viewed as a container filled with operations or events .",
    "the accuracy of spacetime measurement depends on density and distribution of the operations or events .",
    "accordingly , these applications of margolus - levitin theorem are using abstract or concrete models , including quantum mechanical , cosmological , and quantum gravitational ones . since the margolus - levitin theorem is quantum mechanical , and is deduced in pure state system with a non - interacting hamiltonian . what is the validity of margolus - levitin theorem on these applications ?",

    "this new estimation @xmath23 will get a higher bound than margolus - levitin theorem @xmath24 on @xmath0 in some special case@xcite , but we are not able to obtain a new bound with a constant @xmath25 , which limit @xmath0 more strictly than margolus - levitin theorem universally , as in fig . 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical interpretation of the expression @xmath26 with @xmath27 is obscure .",
    "the bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) is more meaningful in mathematics than in physics .",
    "however , margolus - levitin theorem relates the minimal evolving time to the average energy of the system , which offers a relatively clear physical picture . as a result",
    ", we still perceive margolus - levitin theorem as a fine bound of @xmath0 in this letter , and all our generalizations are based on margolus - levitin theorem .",
    "in quantum mechanics , mixed states , composite systems and entangled systems are always focused on as well as pure states , single and non - entangled ones .",
    "some previous work@xcite shows that margolus - levitin theorem as an fundamental limit on @xmath0 has its successful applications on these systems .",
    "consider a general state @xmath28 , and we assume @xmath28 can be decomposed with orthogonal energy eigenstates , @xmath29 here @xmath30 can be viewed as a mixed state or a pure state , depending what value @xmath31 takes .",
    "time translation denoted by an unitary operator @xmath32 transform @xmath30 to @xmath33 , @xmath34 a widely used function fidelity @xmath35 is devoted to discriminate orthogonality on mixed states . when we set @xmath36 to confirm the orthogonality , it is easy to obtain : @xmath37 @xmath8 is energy value of @xmath38(here the hamiltonian is assumed to be diagonal ) .",
    "we can easily see that fidelity coincide with the inner product between initial and final states , while @xmath28 is specialized to a pure state .",
    "further deduction gives out @xmath16 , and @xmath39 is the energy expectation value of the mixed state .",
    "noting that we have not taken interacting hamiltonian in our consideration yet .",
    "directly , this generalization on mixed state lead us to investigate the self consistency of margolus - levitin theorem on all kinds of composite quantum systems . for example , a mixed state @xmath28 can be composed by several pure states(@xmath40 ) , or , a pure state can be represented as directed product of several pure states , etc .",
    "a question is asked , what is relationship between the minimal time to orthogonal state @xmath0 of the system and @xmath41 of the @xmath7th subsystem ? it is answered that in the latter case , @xmath0 is no longer limited by @xmath17 , but , @xmath42 here @xmath8 is the energy expectation value of the @xmath7th subsystem , unless one of the subsystems has all the energy of the system@xcite .",
    "it does mean a composite system may reach its orthogonal state with longer time than single ones with the same average energy . however , the total operations performed by the system should independent of its architecture@xcite . in one second , a system with average energy @xmath4 would perform as most @xmath43 operations , which is the exact summation of maximum operations performed by the subsystems(@xmath44 )",
    "this is another advantage of margolus - levitin theorem , the operation rate of any system / subsystem limited by margolus - levitin theorem is proportional to its energy expectation value , which is a fine extensive variable .",
    "in contrast , the operation rate limited by energy spread @xmath45 @xcite or eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) is not additive generally , which could cause some severe problem .",
    "+ so far we have discussed the minimal time to orthogonal state of a non - entangled system with a free hamiltonian .",
    "although the entangled case or interacting case of margolus - levitin theorem is difficult to formulated , some testing calculation @xcite implies a composite system with entanglement - generating hamiltonian are capable to operate with a rate closer to the margolus - levitin theorem bound than without it .",
    "the differences are dependent on the dominance of interacting , while margolus - levitin theorem is still valid in these cases .",
    "margolus - levitin theorem enable us to evaluate how many operations or events can be discriminated at most of a 4-d space - time system , within a section of its history .",
    "the result should be invariant under any physical transformation of the observer .",
    "but apparently , the above form of the bound is not invariant in relativity . assuming a system @xmath46 with average energy @xmath4",
    "could be reported with @xmath47 operations at most in time @xmath48 , in a rest frame @xmath49 .",
    "now there is another observer in frame @xmath50 , watching @xmath46 is moving along the @xmath51 axis with velocity @xmath52 , with an average energy @xmath53 for a time interval @xmath54 in the same history , where @xmath55 .",
    "the new limitation of operations in frame @xmath50 is @xmath56 .",
    "this paradox does not even exist in special relativity .",
    "accordingly , a moving clock ticks slower than a same static clock with a rate @xmath57 for time dilatation effect . and",
    "the quantities of the ticks or operations detected from the clock is independent of observers for causality .",
    "margolus and levitin has already give a testing form@xcite of the bound of operation quantities detected in @xmath50 , in a special relativity view , which is @xmath58 .",
    "the inner product of 4-momentum @xmath59 and 4-translation @xmath60 guarantees lorentz invariance of the bound . and",
    "this result is easily achieved by replacing quantum field theory of quantum mechanics in deduction . for simplicity",
    "we focus on a state @xmath61 composed by massive particles@xcite , @xmath62 the indexes mean the @xmath7-th eigenstate of @xmath61 is occupied by an @xmath63-th kind of particle with 4-momentum @xmath64 and spin @xmath65 and so on . in quantum field theory ,",
    "a time translation @xmath66 is perceived as a trivial lorentz transformation of the coordinates by @xmath67 , as @xmath68 with a lorentz boost , the state @xmath61 transforms to , @xmath69    then the time translation @xmath66 becomes spacetime translation after the boost ,    @xmath70    here , @xmath71 is a lorentz transformation to the coordinate , @xmath72 is the lorentz transformation belonging to the little group , and @xmath73 furnish a representation of the little group .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "then the form of inner product between the two states becomes relevant to the lorentz boost , @xmath74 we still use inequality @xmath12 $ ] to obtain the special relativistic form of margolus - levitin theorem , @xmath75 \\\\ & = 1-\\frac{2p^\\prime x^\\prime}{\\pi\\hbar}-\\frac{2}{\\pi } im(s ) .",

    "a quick analysis gives the bound of minimal evolving time of orthogonal state of the system , @xmath80 the physical picture of this inequality is confusing . because time is not a lorentz invariant variable , it is not wise for us to seek a relativistic invariant form of minimal evolving time between orthogonal states of the system .",
    "although a system evolving for a time interval @xmath48 in the rest frame @xmath49 , could be described undergoing a dilated time @xmath81 in the moving frame @xmath50 , the bound of quantities of operations or events in the same history is still invariant , @xmath82 where we denote @xmath83 and @xmath84 by @xmath85 and @xmath51 for simplification , and we denote the upper bound of quantities of operations by @xmath86 .",
    "this result is inevitable , since @xmath87 is an direct covariant representation of @xmath88 in the rest frame @xmath49 .",
    "if the 3-components of @xmath85 are all zero-it means the system is relative static to observer-the upper bound @xmath86 degenerates to the original form @xmath88 .",
    "it shows margolus - levitin theorem still works on systems static to observer , and evaluating a covariant bound of @xmath2 is more practical than a covariant bound of @xmath0 .",
    "hence we should seek a generalized form of margolus - levitin theorem to give the bound of @xmath2 of a system other than @xmath0 .",
    "+ as long as the system @xmath46 is simple , it is possible to get the 4-momentum @xmath85 and 4-translation @xmath51 of the system , and to make an inner product .",
    "however in practice , it is hard to define 4-momentum and 4-translation of some complex system such as fluids or radiations . in most theoretical analysis",
    "the enery - momentum tensor @xmath89 is more general than 4-momentum , so a generalized form of margolus - levitin theorem should take @xmath89 as an component of estimation of the bound . apparently , an observer with unit timelike 4-velocity @xmath90 in minkowski spacetime will obtain an energy current density @xmath91@xcite , as measuring a fluid with energy momentum tensor @xmath89 , and the current density satisfies @xmath92 . by using gauss s law , we can get the conservation of energy .",
    "thus we can straightforwardly replace @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) by @xmath94(here a constant @xmath95 is omitted ) and then we get , @xmath96    the equivalence between eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) and margolus - levitin theorem can be proved by setting @xmath97 @xcite , noting that a 3-volume contracts by a factor @xmath57 under boost of lorentz transformation .",
    "since @xmath51 is 4-translation of the system , @xmath98 is not an arbitrary observer s 4-velocity , but the 4-velocities of observers at rest with respect to the system .",
    "this ensures the bound of the system with same history is not depending on different observers .",
    "the covariance of the generalized form is obvious .",
    "@xmath99 is a scalar and @xmath100 is an invariant 4-volume unit in a flat background .",
    "the operational capacity of a system is now determined by @xmath99 and the most quantities of operations or events can be detected is proportional to the size of the 4-volume of the system .",
    "it must be emphasized that the non - negative @xmath2 requires the system obeying the weak energy condition , @xmath101 though in some theory , system with matter violating weak energy condition is not unstable and is able to evolve from its initial state to an orthogonal state to perform operations , the validity of margolus - levitin theorem on these systems is still to be evaluated carefully .",
    "we assert that our estimations of upper bound of quantities of operations are following the weak energy condition .",
    "+ the generalized form of margolus - levitin theorem has a direct application on cosmology .",
    "consider a flat universe with constant @xmath102 above -1 , which describes the massive dust dominant era and radiation dominant era of the universe .",

    "according to our result , the bounds of the quantities of events detected in our universe vary from different expanding history .",
    "this is different with lloyd s result , since his deduction has omitted the expanding details of the universe .",
    "the result depending on @xmath102 can be explained that different expanding history dilute the energy density of the universe with different rate , while the expanding horizon contains more operational units from outside with different rate .",
    "then the form of upper bound of the total events in the observed universe is different among different expanding eras , while it always scales similar to the area of the horizon .",
    "it is consistent with and complementary to the bekenstein bound@xcite .",
    "any appliance of eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) on the @xmath113 matter dominating era is not successful , e.g. the cosmological constant .",

    "in the special relativity , we find that the upper bound of operations is associate with a conserved quantity of energy . however , in general relativity , there is not a notion of the local stress - energy tensor of the gravitational field .",
    "nevertheless , for asymptotically flat spacetimes , conserved quantity of energy associated with asymptotic symmetries has been well defined at spatial and null infinity@xcite .",

    "bekenstein presents a bound on information flow @xmath185@xcite , @xmath186 it is a reinterpretation of the proposition in @xcite as he said .",
    "this bound is consistent with previous work by bremermann and pendry etc@xcite .",
    "how much information can be transferred during the time @xmath178 ? by using ( [ sflow ] ) , it is easy to see that the information @xmath187 , and the entropy taken by the information is @xmath188 .",
    "this means all the information stored in a system can be transfered in a time it takes communicate from one side to the other if we can make the communication channel reach it s capacity limitation .",
    "it is also worth to note that equation ( [ ratio2 ] ) tell us the ultimate computer can produce new information as much as the ultimate communication channel can transfer , so that any computer will always be somewhat parallel .",
    "the form of bekenstein s entropy bound is unapparently covariant .",
    "bousso has already given out an apparently covariant entropy bound for gravitational systems .",

    "the signals might take intricate , long - winded path across the gravitational collapsing system@xcite .",
    "this means it takes more time to send the messages across the system , and more logical operations should be taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ ratio2 ] ) .",
    "it is quite plausible that this mechanism will protect the @xmath86-to-@xmath3 ratio lower bound from being violated .      in @xcite",

    "all the quantitative calculation were taken under the assumption that the entropy in the universe can be described by local entropy density @xmath189 and the matter content can be described by a perfect fluid , with stress tensor @xmath190 .",

    "in this paper , we revised margolus - levitin theorem and compared it with other form of limitation of minimal evolving time .",
    "we stated that margolus - levitin theorem has a clear physical picture and has successful applications on composite systems , mixed state and entanglement systems . following the spirit of margolus - levitin theorem",
    ", we have presented covariant versions of margolus - levitin theorem respectively in special relativity and general relativity .",
    "the covariant version in special relativity is deduced analytically , while the version in general relativity is still tentative but reasonable . after that we give some applications of the versions of margolus - levitin theorem on cosmology and quantum gravitational systems . in the end , we discussed the relation between entropy bound , maximal information flow and computational limit .",
    "all the applications were consistent with previous works , and presented more details and physical pictures on those topics .",
    "+ although the covariant version of margolus - levitin theorem in general relativity has its successful applications , we still need estimations to evaluate its validity more completely .",
    "so far the deduction shows the objects of relativistic version of margolus - levitin theorem are configured on space - like surfaces , excluding null - surfaces . because anything observed by an relativistic observer should be configured on the null - surfaces called light - cones , the deduction of margolus - levitin theorem needs to be extended to null - surfaces .",
