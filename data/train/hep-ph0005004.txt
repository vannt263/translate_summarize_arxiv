    "glueballs , as the most immediate manifestation of gluonic self - interactions in the hadron spectrum , represent a key challenge for our understanding of nonperturbative yang - mills dynamics .",
    "not surprisingly , therefore , theoretical interest in gluonium dates back to the early days of qcd @xcite and has spurred intense research activity ever since .",
    "estimates of glueball properties were obtained in a variety of approaches , ranging from model analyses @xcite and steadily improving lattice simulations @xcite to qcd sum rule calculations @xcite .    the qcd sum - rule technique , in particular , combines the advantages of an analytical approach with a firm and largely model - independent basis in qcd and should therefore be well suited for obtaining qualitative and quantitative insight into the glueball spectrum . during its early development ,",
    "however , it became clear that this approach encounters conceptual and practical problems in the scalar glueball channel @xcite .",
    "these problems , which have so far prevented fully consistent and conclusive sum - rule predictions , can be traced to the exceptionally strong coupling of the vacuum to the spin-0 glueball interpolators .",
    "the intense vacuum response generates nonperturbative violations of asymptotic freedom starting from unusually small distances @xmath3 fm @xcite , and the power corrections of the conventional operator product expansion ( ope ) are much too weak to account for this physics @xcite . as a consequence , stability and mutual consistency of different sum rules ( see below ) is partially lacking , and serious difficulties are encountered in reconciling the sum rules with the low - energy theorem @xcite which governs the long - distance behavior of the scalar glueball correlator .    in search of the origin for the apparently missing nonperturbative short - distance physics",
    "it is natural to expect that it may at least partly be provided by small ( or `` direct '' ) instantons @xcite .",
    "indeed , as coherent vacuum gluon fields instantons couple particularly strongly to the gluonic interpolators of the @xmath4 glueball channel . nevertheless , they are neglected in the perturbatively calculated wilson coefficients of the conventional ope .",
    "an additional and  perhaps more intuitive reason for expecting instanton physics to play a major role in the structure of scalar glueballs derives from their exceptionally small size @xmath5 fm , found in lattice @xcite and instanton vacuum model @xcite calculations .",
    "since @xmath6 is much smaller than the confinement scale and the size of heavier glueballs , it is rather unlikely that scalar glueballs are bound predominantly by ( iterated ) perturbative or by confinement forces .",
    "the attractive interactions mediated by instantons provide a suggestive alternative .    motivated by the above considerations , our main objectives in this paper are to evaluate the direct instanton sector of the scalar glueball correlator by means of an instanton - improved ope ( iope ) and to analyze the ensuing glueball sum rules . while analytical instanton calculations ( at low energies ) have long been hampered by insufficient knowledge of the instanton size distribution and notorious infrared problems , this impasse",
    "can nowadays be avoided by relying on the results of instanton vacuum model @xcite and lattice @xcite simulations for the required bulk features of the instanton distribution , i.e. , for the average instanton size @xmath7 fm and density @xmath8 @xmath9 . despite remaining numerical discrepancies pertaining to the distribution of large - size instantons , these scales provide  a solid foundation for our calculations below to which only small instantons of sizes @xmath10 0.5 fm will contribute",
    "our study will be based on the correlation function @xmath11 with the interpolating field @xmath12 carrying the quantum numbers of the scalar glueball .",

    "analogous contributions were found to be important in several nucleon @xcite and pion @xcite  sum rules . as noted there ,",
    "effects of multi - instanton correlations can be neglected in the short - distance expansion since the relevant distances @xmath28 fm are much smaller than the average separation @xmath29 fm between instantons in the vacuum .",

    "the quantitative analysis of the sum rules amounts to determining those values of the hadronic parameters in eq .",
    "( [ specdens ] ) for which both sides of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) optimally match in the fiducial borel domain . towards large @xmath63",
    "this domain is bounded by keeping the contribution of the highest - dimensional operator ( @xmath64 ) to @xmath65 below 10% and requiring multi - instanton contributions to be negligible .",
    "the latter requirement will be ( conservatively ) implemented by demanding @xmath66 gev@xmath67 .  towards small @xmath63",
    "we prescribe that the continuum contributions do not exceed 50% of the @xmath65 .",
    "the standard optimization procedure followed in previous analyses determined only the glueball mass @xmath68 and coupling @xmath69 from matching the sum rules , while the threshold @xmath52 had to be found by other means ( e.g. by finite - energy sum rules @xcite or stability criteria @xcite ) .",
    "the iope sum rules turn out to be stable enough , however , to determine @xmath70 together with the resonance parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the same sum rule .",
    "this is the procedure which we will adopt below .",
    "we start by analyzing the @xmath71 sum rule [ i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) with @xmath72 .",
    "figure 1 shows both sides  of the optimized sum rule and separately the three components ( ope with subtracted ope continuum , instanton contribution , and instanton continuum ) which make up its left - hand side .",
    "the matching between both sides of the sum rule is almost perfect over the whole fiducial region . comparing standard ope and instanton ( including continuum ) contributions",
    "shows that the latter are about 5 times larger .",
    "thus , the instanton contributions strongly dominate over the whole fiducial region and increase the predictions for @xmath73 by about a factor of 5 , resulting in @xmath74 gev .",
    "a similarly strong enhancement of @xmath69 was found in instanton vacuum model calculations @xcite .",
    "the prediction for the glueball mass , @xmath75 gev , on the other hand , differs surprisingly little from what is obtained without the instanton part .",
    "the continuum threshold becomes @xmath76 gev@xmath77 .",
    "figure 1 furthermore reveals that the instanton contributions to the unitarity cut are indispensable for generating an exponential @xmath63 behavior below @xmath78 gev@xmath67 , and thus for an acceptable fit to the pole contribution .",
    "( for larger values of @xmath63 the continuum contributions are practically negligible and a fit to the instanton contribution alone would become possible , although mostly outside of the fiducial domain and with about 20% smaller values for @xmath68 and @xmath79 . )",
    "it should also be noted that the hard nonperturbative instanton physics begins to enter @xmath71 at much smaller @xmath63 than the soft condensate contributions , thereby confirming the existence of an exceptionally large mass scale in the scalar glueball channel @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the remaining sum rules ( which all show a high degree of stability ) confirms the above observations about the role of the instanton contributions . as an additional example",
    ", we plot in fig .",
    "2 the separate contributions to the @xmath80 sum rule and the fit of both sides , which is again excellent .",
    "since the instanton contribution is somewhat less pronounced than in @xmath71 , we find a smaller value for the coupling : @xmath81 gev .",
    "the result for the glueball mass increases to @xmath82 gev , and the threshold @xmath83 gev@xmath77 is slightly reduced .",
    "the results of the @xmath61 and @xmath84 sum rules confirm the tendency of lower moments to predict somewhat smaller masses and somewhat larger couplings [ while maintaining consistency with the low - energy theorem ( [ let ] ) ] .",
    "the predictions of the higher moments should be more reliable , however , because they receive stronger pole contributions .",
    "the @xmath61 sum rule has played both conceptually and practically a special role since it contains the subtraction constant @xmath85 which dominates the power corrections of the conventional ope ( in the fiducial region ) .",
    "attempts to fit the resulting , almost flat @xmath63 behavior to the exponential pole contribution inevitably generate very small pole masses , at least half an order of magnitude smaller than those predicted by the other sum rules . this well - known inconsistency ( and the need to abandon the @xmath61 sum rule in practice )",
    "is largely resolved by the massive instanton contributions .",
    "their strong decay yields excellent fits and pole masses of the same order as those obtained from the higher moments .",
    "still , the @xmath61 sum rule remains probably least suited for quantitative predictions since it is most sensitive to the inaccurately known value of the gluon condensate and least sensitive to the pole contribution .",
    "the mutual agreement of all four iope sum rules ( in the typical range of uncertainty for sum rule results ) and their consistency with the low - energy theorem , obtained from the uv - regularized , unsubtracted dispersion relation with the spectral density ( [ specdens ] ) ( where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath52 have the predicted values )  satisfies the low - energy theorem ( [ let ] ) for all four sum rules in the range of uncertainty introduced by the inaccurately known value of the gluon condensate @xcite . ] , however , is reassuring and of considerable conceptual importance .",
    "for a quantitative consistency check between the predictions of different sum rules , we have evaluated the @xmath63-dependent mass function @xmath86 figure 3 shows that it deviates less than 2% from the constant @xmath68 over the whole fiducial region , indicating a high degree of compatibility between the sum rules .",
    "we have also found that the instanton contributions to the @xmath65 by themselves can generate stable sum rules .",
    "their approximately exponential @xmath87 behavior matches very well to the pole term , although with about 20% smaller glueball masses than those obtained from the full sum rules .",
    "this indicates that instantons alone can ( over- ) bind the scalar glueball , in agreement with the findings of instanton vacuum models @xcite ( which also show a tendency towards smaller glueball masses ) .",
    "we evaluated and analyzed the instanton contributions both to the ope of the scalar glueball correlator ( or , more precisely , to the wilson coefficient of the unit operator ) and to the continuum part of its phenomenological spectral - function model , and we solved the corresponding qcd sum rules .",
    "the previously neglected instanton contributions turn out to be dominant and render the iope sum rules the first overall consistent set in the scalar glueball channel .    in particular",
    ", the iope resolves two long - standing flaws of the earlier sum rules : the mutual inconsistency between different borel moments and the inconsistency with the low - energy theorem for the zero - momentum correlator .",
    "even the previously deficient and usually discarded lowest - moment ( @xmath88 ) sum rule becomes consistent both with those from the higher moments and with the low - energy theorem .",
    "any evidence for a low - lying ( @xmath89 gev ) gluonium state ( or a state strongly coupled to gluonic interpolators ) , sometimes argued for on the basis of this sum rule @xcite , is thereby rendered obsolete .",
    "the most dramatic phenomenological impact of the direct instanton contributions is associated with @xmath73 , the residuum of the glueball pole . due to the exceptional size of the instanton contributions ,",
    "its value increases by about a factor of 5 . taking the quantitative predictions of the @xmath80 sum rule to be the most reliable ones , we obtain @xmath90 gev ( in accord with recent lattice results @xcite ) and @xmath2 gev , where the errors are estimated from the uncertainties of the input parameters and the spread between the individual sum rules .",
    "potential ramifications for experimental glueball searches will be considered in a forthcoming publication .",
    "all four iope sum rules show an unprecedented degree of stability and allow for a simultaneous 3-parameter fit to the glueball mass , its coupling , and the continuum threshold .",
    "the stability region extends far beyond the fiducial @xmath63 interval and renders , as a side effect , the iope sum rule results almost insensitive to the precise boundaries of the fiducial domain .",
    "most importantly , however , the high stability indicates that the iope provides a rather complete description of the short - distance glueball correlator .",
    "a crucial contribution to the iope sum rules arises from the discontinuity of the instanton terms in the extended continuum part of the spectral functions .",
    "( the rough estimate of instanton contributions to the @xmath91 sum rule in ref .",
    "@xcite missed this contribution . ) in addition to substantially improving the overall consistency and stability of the sum rules , the richer structure on the phenomenological sides also sheds new light on the spectral content of the scalar glueball correlator .",
    "for once , the quantitative sum - rule analysis reveals that the instanton contributions , together with the weaker perturbative terms , counterbalance the pole contribution .",
    "this leads to an improved description of the correlator towards low momenta and thereby reconciles the sum rules with the low - energy theorem ( [ let ] ) , a stringent consistency check in the @xmath92 limit .",
    "a remarkable interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative physics can also be seen in the opposite limit , i.e. at short distances . as a consequence of the improved continuum description ,",
    "the instanton contributions to the correlator remain effective at small @xmath63 and stay finite even for @xmath93 ( in contrast to their contributions to the iope in the same limit , which suffer the expected suppression associated with funnelling a sizeable momentum through the coherent instanton field ) .",
    "this indicates that small - instanton physics accounts not only for much of the ground - state contribution but also for part of the higher - lying spectral strength ( in the sense of a generalized quark - hadron duality ) in the scalar glueball correlator .",
    "thus , the spectral distribution favored by the iopesum rules seems to imply a rather prominent role for instanton - induced effects in excited glueball states ( or in multiparticle states with strong coupling to the energy - momentum tensor )",
    ". the phenomenological impact of these results , which do not depend on details of the iope and should therefore be rather robust , deserves further study .",
    "in contrast to previously studied iope sum rules for quark - based correlators @xcite , those for the scalar glueball are the first where ( i ) the instanton contributions do not enter via topological quark zero - modes and ( ii ) the sum rules reach a satisfactory ( though not excellent ) level of consistency even without any perturbative and soft contributions , i.e. , with the instanton terms alone .",
    "the latter result explains why the instanton liquid model yields scalar glueball properties similar to those obtained above @xcite , and can be traced to both the exceptional strength and the particular shape ( mainly the curvature ) of the instanton contributions . in combination",
    ", those properties produce an approximately exponential @xmath63 dependence which extends far beyond the fiducial region and fairly well matches the ground - state signal without any perturbative and condensate contributions .",
    "the predominance and approximate self - sufficiency of the instanton contributions has a suggestive physical interpretation : it indicates that instantons may generate the bulk of the attractive forces which bind the scalar glueball .",
    "moreover , and in contrast to the instanton liquid model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the iope allows to consistently compare the instanton contributions with those of the remaining soft and perturbative fields , and to thereby judge their relative importance . at present",
    ", the iope seems to be the only controlled and analytical framework in which this can be achieved .",
    "the combined effect of the soft and perturbative contributions turns out to be repulsive and increases , consistently in all sum rules , the glueball mass by about 20% .    finally ,",
    "closer inspection of the iope  sum rules reveals another , quite striking instanton effect : the scales of the predicted @xmath0 glueball properties turn out to be approximately set by the bulk features of the instanton size distribution .",
    "indeed , neglecting the standard ope contributions one finds that the glueball parameters scale as @xmath94 in the case of proportionality between the glueball size @xmath95 and its compton wavelength , one would obtain another scaling relation @xmath96 which could explain the small values @xmath97 0.2 fm found on the lattice @xcite .",
    "conceptually , the main virtue of the above scaling relations lies in establishing an explicit link between fundamental vacuum and hadron properties .",
    "although strong interdependences between qcd vacuum and hadron structure are expected on general grounds , such scaling relations seem to have not been encountered previously .",
    "they could be of practical use e.g. for the test of instanton vacuum models , to provide constraints for glueball model building , or generalized to finite temperature and baryon density , where the scales of the instanton distribution change .",
