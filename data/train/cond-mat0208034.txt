    "note that in region ii only the two asymmetric solutions with positive and negative particle excesses are stable , and have the same maximum while in region i only the symmetric solution is stable .",
    "therefore the stationary probability distribution has the double peaks in region ii and only the central peak in region i. in region iii and iv both the symmetric and the asymmetric solutions are stable so that the maximum of @xmath66 should be determined by comparing its values at the stable fixed points .",
    "the crossover of the maximum point occurs when both values coincide .",
