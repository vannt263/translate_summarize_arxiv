    "data from the planck satellite @xcite and other cosmological probes have provided astoundingly precise information on cosmology .",
    "while some cosmological parameters , like the spatial curvature , are probed directly by the cmb measurements , others can only be inferred indirectly from a global fit to all cosmological parameters simultaneously .",
    "the prime example in the last category is the hubble parameter which formally has been determined very accurately from planck data @xcite .",
    "however , the inferred value can only be trusted within the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model .",
    "furthermore there is a pronounced discrepancy between the value inferred from cmb data and the value measured directly using standard candles in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is mitigated if the model includes additional relativistic species ( i.e. a non - standard value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "concerning neutrinos , big bang nucleosythesis ( bbn ) , cmb and large scale structure ( lss ) measurements disfavor a fourth ( sterile ) neutrino with a mass in the ev range , as indicated by oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons : on the one hand one additional degree of freedom is excluded by bbn and cmb observations ; on the other hand the ev mass scale is ruled out with high significance by lss bounds .",
    "recently , various models of neutrino self - interactions @xcite have been proposed to reconcile sterile neutrinos in cosmology , by preventing additional neutrinos from being fully thermalized in the early universe . among the secret interaction models ,",
    "the pseudoscalar model @xcite , where interactions are confined to the sterile sector and mediated by a light pseudoscalar , can naturally accommodate one ev - sterile neutrino in cosmology , solving the tension with bbn and cmb measurements .",
    "specifically , the model considered couples the mainly sterile 4th neutrino mass state , @xmath2 , to a new light pseudoscalar , @xmath3 , with mass @xmath4 via @xmath5 this new interaction provides a background matter potential for neutrinos which is quadratic in @xmath6 and , provided that the coupling constant @xmath7 is larger than @xmath8 , the sterile neutrino production in the early universe is significantly suppressed until after the decoupling of active neutrinos .",
    "this means that the total energy density in active neutrinos , quantified in terms of @xmath9 with @xmath10 , can be significantly lower than the @xmath11 predicted in the absence of non - standard interactions .",
    "however , even in the presence of a significant non - standard matter potential , sterile and active neutrinos can still equilibrate at later times , and if the sterile neutrino has a mass of order 1 ev this can lead to conflict with the cosmological bound on neutrino mass @xcite .    here",
    "we will refrain from a detailed calculation of how efficient the equilibration is and simply use the most conservative assumption possible .",
    "naively we expect that full equilibration leads to @xmath12 in the sterile sector and @xmath13 in the active sector .",
    "however , the pseudoscalar interaction leads to a strong coupling between sterile neutrinos and pseudoscalars at late times .",
    "if this happens prior to active - sterile equilibration the division will be @xmath14 in the strongly coupled @xmath15 fluid and @xmath16 in the remaining non - interacting and massless neutrinos . as we will see in the next section structure formation data prefer a smaller fraction of the strongly interacting component , so taking the fraction to be @xmath17 is the most conservative choice .",
    "the late - time phenomenology of the pseudoscalar model leads to a collisional recoupling of sterile neutrinos via the process @xmath18 before their non - relativistic transition ( assuming @xmath19 and @xmath20 ev ) and before recombination . in the collisional regime , neutrinos and pseudoscalars are not free - streaming , but rather behave as a single fluid with no anisotropic stress .",
    "the impact on the cmb temperature power spectrum consists of an enhancement of the monopole term @xcite , which would spoil the planck measurements if the collisional regime was extended to all neutrino species , including active neutrinos .    at temperatures higher than the sterile neutrino mass",
    "the combined fluid is fully relativistic with an effective equation of state parameter of @xmath21 .",
    "however , when sterile neutrinos go non relativistic , they annihilate into pseudoscalars @xmath22 , while the inverse process @xmath23 becomes kinematically prohibited .",
    "this increases the energy density of the combined fluid relative to that of a fully relativistic fluid . during this process",
    "the pressure of the combined fluid also drops relative to energy density because of the importance of the rest mass of the sterile neutrino @xcite .",
    "however , for much lower temperatures the fluid consists only of pseudoscalars and is again fully relativistic with @xmath21 .",
    "the redshift where deviations in @xmath24 and @xmath25 set in depends directly on the sterile neutrino mass .",
    "we have shown the redshift evolution of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the upper and lower panel of figure [ fig : rhow ] , respectively .",
    "+     at the end of the annihilation processes the cosmic abundance of sterile neutrinos is highly suppressed and there is little suppression of matter fluctuations on small scales .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the @xmath0cdm model where the presence of a free streaming massive sterile neutrino causes a dramatic suppression of the matter power spectrum .",
    "the difference between the two scenarios can easily be seen in figure  [ fig : mpk ] where we show the matter power spectrum obtained for three different sterile neutrino masses : in the pseudoscalar scenario the increase in the sterile neutrino mass does not lead to the suppression of power at small scales that one finds in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "( lower panel ) and the pseudoscalar model ( upper panel ) for various values of the sterile neutrino mass and for @xmath26 ( in the pseudoscalar model @xmath27 are strongly interacting ) . for comparision , the matter power spectrum obtained with planck 2015 best - fit",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      if the only non - standard physics is the addition of a sterile neutrino with the mass and mixing needed to explain the short baseline data , the expectation is that the additional species are almost fully thermalised in the early universe ( for a recent treatment see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the prediction therefore is that @xmath11 and @xmath28 or @xmath29 ev @xcite .",
    "thus , when testing the @xmath0cdm model with a varying sterile neutrino mass @xmath30 , we will keep @xmath26 .",
    "hereafter we will refer to this model as the @xmath31 model , while the pure @xmath0cdm model with 3.046 massless active neutrinos is denoted by @xmath0 and the model with @xmath32 ev fully thermalized sterile neutrino is denoted by @xmath33 .      in the pseudoscalar model",
    "@xmath1 is a free parameter depending on @xmath6 . however ,",

    "however , this ratio could be smaller if equilibration is incomplete or if steriles and pseudoscalars equilibrate after active - sterile equilibration . in most runs",
    "we fix the ratio , @xmath38 , to 11/32 , but we have also tested the case where @xmath38 is allowed to vary .    we stress that each value of @xmath6 corresponds to _ one _ value of @xmath1 and _ one _ value of @xmath38 , but while @xmath1 can be found as a function of @xmath6  @xcite , the calculation yielding @xmath38 is unfeasible to perform using current technology , and we simply leave @xmath38 as a free parameter when considering partial equilibration . when also letting @xmath1 vary freely , the result is a two - dimensional parameter space , where the pseudoscalar models trace out a one - dimensional path .      in order to test the ability of the pseudoscalar model to fit cosmological data and to constrain its parameters ,",

    "the preference for @xmath101 at more than @xmath96 underlines that additional neutrino species can not be free - streaming at recoupling , thus , if the short baseline experiments will confirm the existence of a sterile neutrino , non standard interactions will be required in order to accommodate a fourth neutrino in cosmology .",
    "note that the usual correlation between the scalar spectral index @xmath40 and @xmath1 is driven by diffusion damping at large @xmath102 which are absent for a tightly coupled fluid .",

    "the grey region shows the @xmath95 confidence interval from direct measurements . ]",
    "we have tested the pseudoscalar model against the most precise available cosmological data and found that the model is generally compatible with data , providing at least as good a fit as the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "furthermore the fit is vastly better than @xmath0cdm with an additional sterile neutrino in the ev mass range .",
    "if the ev sterile neutrino interpretation of short baseline data turns out to be true cosmology is faced with a very serious challenge .",
    "taken at face value such a model is excluded by cmb and large scale structure data at least at the 5@xmath107 level . with this in mind",
