    "amongst the most intriguing and unique features in exotic nuclei are rather significant changes from the conventional magic structure . as a result of them , the ground state of a nucleus with @xmath0  or",
    "@xmath4 close to a conventional magic number is not necessarily spherical , and can be strongly deformed .",
    "its fingerprint was first identified from extra binding energies of @xmath5na @xcite , whose origin was regarded , consistently with a hartree - fock calculation @xcite , as the dominance of strongly deformed intruder components in the ground state over the normal components . here ,",
    "normal ( intruder ) states imply the states comprised of shell - model configurations without ( with ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 or higher excited configurations across the @xmath2 shell gap .",
    "later , more direct experimental evidence of the strong deformation was found for @xmath8 mg from the low excitation energy of the @xmath9 state @xcite and the large @xmath10 @xcite value .",
    "thus , the disappearance of the @xmath0=20 magic structure has been established in some @xmath2 isotones including the recent case for @xmath11ne @xcite .",
    "it still remains , however , an open question as to where the ground state changes from a normal- to an intruder - dominant configuration in the chain of isotopes , and the question as to what mechanism drives this disappearance remains .",
    "the present paper aims at presenting the resolution of these questions , as exemplified in the structure of na isotopes .    for na isotopes",
    ", one may expect that the onset of the intruder - dominance of the ground state lies right at @xmath2 , from the comparison of the experimental mass to a shell - model result within the @xmath12 shell with the usd interaction @xcite .",
    "the usd interaction has been the most frequently used interaction in the @xmath12 shell , and we shall refer to shell model calculations with this interaction in the @xmath12 shell as usd model or calculation , hereafter .",
    "a similar picture about the onset is assumed in the so - called `` island of inversion '' model @xcite , where the lowest normal and the lowest intruder states are confronted without mixing between them .",
    "although the mass ( or the separation energy ) often provides us with helpful information on shell structure , studies from different angles are needed before one draws definite conclusions , as we shall demonstrate .",
    "the first part of the present paper is focused upon re - examination on the dominant configuration of the ground state of na isotopes .",
    "we perform a large - scale shell - model calculation using the monte carlo shell model ( mcsm ) @xcite , which is briefly described in sec .  [",
    "sec : sm ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mom ] and [ sec : level ] , respectively , the electromagnetic moments and the energy levels are discussed , and from such discussions the transition point from the normal- to intruder - dominant ground state is identified in the chain of na isotopes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gap ] , the second part of the present paper , we discuss the mechanism of the disappearance of the magic structure , focusing upon the ( effective ) @xmath0=20 gap between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 shells and emphasizing the special importance of the nucleus @xmath11na on this issue from a somewhat general viewpoint .",
    "we finally summarize the present study in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the model space and the effective interaction used in the present study are the same as those of our previous studies @xcite : the valence shell consists of the full @xmath12-shell orbits and two lower @xmath13-shell orbits .",
    "the effective interaction is called hereafter _",
    "sdpf - m _ for the sake of clarification from other interactions .",
    "the sdpf - m interaction was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in 1999 , by combining the usd interaction @xcite for the @xmath12 shell , the kuo - brown interaction @xcite for the @xmath13 shell , and a modified millener - kurath interaction @xcite for the cross shell . on top of this ,",
    "a small but important modification was made for its monopole part @xcite as we shall add some remarks later .",
    "a unique feature of the sdpf - m interaction is that the neutron shell structure , defined by the _ effective single - particle energy _ ( espe ) , changes , as a function of the proton number , more significantly than in previous models , for instance , the `` island of inversion '' @xcite . here",
    ", the espe includes mean effects from other valence nucleons on top of the usual single - particle energies with respect to the given inert core ( i.e. , closed shell ) .",
    "therefore , the espe depends on shell - model interactions between valence nucleons .",
    "the present varying shell structure can be explained by the shell evolution mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of the spin - isospin property of the effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath14 ) interaction .",
    "the strong @xmath15 monopole attraction between the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 enlarges the @xmath2 gap , as protons occupy @xmath17 .",
    "inversely , this effect diminishes towards @xmath18 , ending up with a rather narrow @xmath2 gap and a wider @xmath19 gap .",
    "this shell evolution leads us to the oxygen drip line at @xmath19 @xcite as a result of emerging @xmath19 magic number @xcite .",
    "the monopole part of the sdpf - m interaction was modified from that of the usd interaction so as to reproduce the oxygen drip line @xcite , while the resultant monopole part is closer to the g - matrix result as emphasized in @xcite .    in the @xmath2 region ,",
    "as we shall illustrate , the na isotopes give indispensable information on this shell evolution : ( i ) specific na isotopes provide us with clues of a narrow @xmath2 shell gap , ( ii ) with odd @xmath4 , their ground - state properties can be directly examined by non - vanishing electromagnetic moments , and ( iii ) many experimental data have been recently accumulated about the mass @xcite , moment @xcite , @xmath20-ray spectrum and transition by the coulomb excitation @xcite , etc .",
    "thus , we carry out shell - model studies on na isotopes from @xmath0=16 to 20 .",
    "since the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix becomes prohibitively large with the present problems , we perform a shell - model calculation by the mcsm based on the quantum monte carlo diagonalization ( qmcd ) method whose development has been described in @xcite . in the present mcsm calculation",
    ", we adopt the so - called _ @xmath21-compressed _ bases @xcite , i.e. , bases generated and adopted by monitoring the energy with the full angular momentum projection .",
    "the feasibility of the mcsm calculation for odd-@xmath22 nuclei has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this method works very well for odd - odd nuclei as well .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the @xmath23 matrix elements are calculated with the effective charges @xmath24 which are the same as those used in the usd model @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed that the mcsm with these effective charges excellently reproduce the @xmath25 values of even - even nuclei from stable to unstable nuclei @xcite . as for the effective @xmath26 operator , brown and wildenthal took an empirically optimum one within the usd model @xcite .",
    "they found that the free - nucleon @xmath27 factors give no obviously deviating magnetic moments but more quantitative agreement can be attained with the empirically optimum operator : for @xmath28 , @xmath29 is quenched by a factor 0.85 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are used where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the orbital angular momentum , the intrinsic spin , and @xmath37^{(1)}$ ] operators , respectively .",
    "recently , honma _ et al .",
    "_ have presented in @xcite that the spin @xmath27 factor does not have to be much quenched in the full @xmath13-shell model space using their newly developed interaction @xcite .",
    "based on these extensive shell - model studies , the @xmath27 factors are adopted , in the present mcsm calculations , so as to be rather close to the above - mentioned ones . namely the spin part is quenched by a factor 0.9 , and the other @xmath27 factors are shifted from the free - nucleon values by @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the isovector @xmath27 factor defined by @xmath40=@xmath41 .",
    "the shell - model calculation described in the above section is carried out for na isotopes from @xmath19 to 20 .",
    "we first compare , in fig .",
    "[ fig : moment ] , the electric quadrupole moments and the magnetic dipole moments between the mcsm with the sdpf - m interaction and experimental data . as a reference ,",
    "results from the usd model are presented , also . for the @xmath19 and 17 isotopes ,",
    "the experimental moments @xcite are well reproduced by both the shell - model calculations , reflecting the dominance of the @xmath12-shell configurations in their ground states ( see fig .",

    "it can be inferred , from the agreement with the experimental magnetic moments , that the present nucleon @xmath27 factors are reasonable . at @xmath42 ,",
    "the sdpf - m and usd calculations still give similar magnetic moments in good agreement with the experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the quadrupole moment by the sdpf - m is larger by about 30% than the usd value .",
    "recently , a very precise measurement of the quadrupole moments for na isotopes has been carried out by keim _",
    "the measured quadrupole moment of @xmath43na is 8.6(3 ) @xmath44@xmath45 in a good agreement with the sdpf - m prediction , 9.1 @xmath44@xmath45 . on the other hand",
    ", the deviation of the usd result for @xmath43na from experiment seems somewhat larger than that for typical @xmath12-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "the situation is almost unchanged if the radial wave function is replaced with the hartree - fock one or if the isovector effective charge is tuned @xcite .",
    "it was thus suspected in @xcite that the experimental quadrupole moment of @xmath43na might indicate some influence from the intruder configurations .",

    "let us start with the most unstable isotope , @xmath49na .",
    "the @xmath49na nucleus ( @xmath2 ) has been known as a typical case of the intruder dominance in the ground state @xcite .",
    "its magnetic moment was reproduced by previous shell - model calculations in a large shell - model space by fukunishi _",
    "_ @xcite and by caurier _",
    "@xcite , supporting this picture . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : moment ] ( c ) , the present calculation , allowing full configurations within the valence shell , confirms the intruder dominance in @xmath49na and indicates some mixing of even higher intruder configurations .",
    "accordingly , we can reproduce not only the magnetic moment but also the quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "note that the prediction of the energy of the first excited state of @xmath49na @xcite is in agreement with the measurement by intermediate - energy coulomb excitation @xcite .",
    "we shall now move on to @xmath11na ( @xmath1 ) , which is the most crucial nucleus in this paper .",
    "the ground - state property of @xmath11na had been rather obscure so far .",
    "the observed two - neutron separation energy shows no deviation from the usd - model systematics .",
    "the ground - state spin @xmath50 @xcite can be explained by the usd model .",
    "this is in contrast to the anomalous @xmath51 ground state in @xmath49na , which is not obtained by the usd model .",
    "the experimental magnetic moment of @xmath11na 2.083(10 ) @xmath52 @xcite , however , deviates from the usd - model value 2.69 @xmath52 .",
    "this deviation seems to be somewhat larger than typical deviations in @xmath12-shell nuclei .",
    "[ fig : moment ] ( b ) shows , this deviation is resolved by the mcsm with the sdpf - m interaction as a consequence of the intruder ground state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : moment ] ( c ) ) . as the calculated magnetic moments of @xmath53na can be changed only less than by 0.1 @xmath52 by replacing the effective @xmath27 factors with the free nucleon ones , the agreement with the experiment should not be attributed to the choice of the @xmath27 factors .",
    "recently , the quadrupole moment has been measured also by keim et al .",
    "this value , even its sign , turns out to be quite different from the usd prediction .",
    "figure  [ fig : moment ] ( a ) indicates that the mcsm with the sdpf - m interaction indeed reproduces this quadrupole moment , too .",
    "therefore , the properties of the electromagnetic moments indicate that , in na isotopes , the ground state is dominated by the intruder configurations at @xmath1 ( @xmath11na ) , and intruder configurations are substantially mixed in the ground state already at @xmath42",
    ".    it may be of interest to discuss the binding energies of na isotopes to some detail , because the usd model explains the observed trend of binding energies up to @xmath0=19 rather well .",
    "figure  [ fig : s2n ] compares the two - neutron separation energies ( @xmath54 ) of na isotopes between the experiment @xcite and the shell - model calculations .",

    "the competition between normal and intruder configurations in @xmath11na seems to be very intriguing , and is discussed in the next section in more detail .",
    "from the above discussions on the moments and the levels , it becomes evident that the transition from the normal to intruder ground state occurs fully at @xmath1 , after strong normal - intruder mixing already at @xmath42 .",
    "we shall show , in this section , that this normal - intruder transition for @xmath102 20 is particularly sensitive to the shell gap .    in general",
    ", an intruder state can be the ground state , if the energy gain due to dynamical correlations including deformation overcomes the energy loss in transcending nucleons across the shell gap .",
    "the shell gap is nothing but the difference between espe s of relevant orbits .",
    "the neutron espe changes rather gradually as a function of the neutron number , since the monopole interaction for @xmath103 is weak .",
    "namely , the neutron shell gap is rather constant as a function of the neutron number .",
    "this implies that what is crucial in the transition from a normal to an intruder ground state within an isotope chain is primarily the neutron - number dependence of the correlation energy and its relative magnitude to the shell gap . here",
    ", a good index of the correlation energy is the difference between the eigenvalue of the total hamiltonian and the expectation value of the monopole interaction for the filling configuration .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] , the sources of the correlation energy are sketched schematically . since a normal state of a ( neutron ) semi - magic nucleus",
    "consists of configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( a ) , only the proton rearrangement is relevant to the correlation energy , which is generally small . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation energy is very large in the case of an intruder state composed of configurations like fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( b ) , due to large numbers of particles and holes in active orbits .",
    "we note that the proton - neutron interaction produces much larger correlation energies than the interactions between like nucleons .",
    "this makes the correlation energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( b ) much larger than that of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( a ) , favoring the normal - intruder inversion even with a large shell gap .        on the other hand , in the cases like fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( c ) and ( d ) , a normal state of an open - shell nucleus has a neutron hole already .",
    "the neutron rearrangement is then possible , and strong proton - neutron two - body matrix elements contribute to the correlation energy .",
    "the intruder configurations of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( d ) gain correlation energy similarly to the case of fig.[fig : corr ] ( b ) .",
    "however , the difference of the correlation energy between fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( a ) and ( b ) is larger than that between fig .  [",
    "fig : corr ] ( c ) and ( d ) , because of the saturation of the correlation energy with many particles and many holes as is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ( d ) .",
    "a concrete example can be found with the usd interaction : a semi - magic @xmath49na gains the correlation energy only by 1.7 mev within the @xmath12 shell , whereas it increases to 3.7 mev for @xmath11na and further to 7.2 mev for @xmath43na .",
    "the correlation energy of intruder states increases more slowly due to the saturation as mentioned just above .",
    "this implies that the intruder dominance in @xmath104 nuclei becomes less favored as @xmath0 goes down from 20 .",
    "hence , if the normal - intruder inversion still occurs , it should be due to a narrower shell gap .",
    "we shall present a more detailed account on this point now .",
    "the sdpf - m interaction indeed gives a narrow @xmath2 shell gap ( @xmath101 3 mev ) for na isotopes .",
    "note that it still reproduces the large gap ( @xmath101 6 mev ) of @xmath3ca , owing to its monopole property .",
    "we now demonstrate how such a narrow gap of na isotopes plays a crucial role in the intruder dominance in @xmath11na , by means of a simulation based on the argument just above .",
    "namely , we vary the shell gap from the value given by the sdpf - m interaction to larger values , to see what happens .",
    "this can be done by changing the monopole interaction between the @xmath17 and the @xmath16 as @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the monopole interaction between @xmath107 and @xmath108 orbits with isospin coupled to @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath110 is to control the espe : @xmath111 represents the situation with the sdpf - m interaction as a starting point .",
    "a larger @xmath110 means primarily a lower neutron @xmath16 level , i.e. , a wider @xmath2 gap in @xmath11na .",
    "other effects are minor in this nucleus .    na as a function of the @xmath2 shell gap ( controlled by a parameter @xmath110 in eq .",

    "the range of the shell gap giving the @xmath116 ground state ( @xmath117 ) is indicated by @xmath118ex .",
    "note that the corresponding shell gaps of @xmath119na are , respectively , smaller and larger by 0.24  mev than the one of @xmath11na .",
    ", width=264 ]    figure  [ fig : varspe ] presents the variation of the ground - state properties of na isotopes as a function of the gap thus varied .",
    "results are mainly about @xmath11na unless otherwise specified .",
    "the sdpf - m interaction ( at @xmath111 ) gives a narrow @xmath2 shell gap , i.e. , 3.3 mev for @xmath11na .",
    "as @xmath110 is increased , the gap becomes wider , and the @xmath3ca gap ( @xmath120 mev ) is given by @xmath121 .",
    "an intermediate value @xmath122 reproduces the gap of usd ( @xmath123 mev ) , implying that the usd includes some fractional effects of the current shell evolution @xcite .    the quadrupole moment and the magnetic moment in fig .",
    "[ fig : varspe ] ( a ) and ( b ) are almost constant up to the  gap  @xmath101  4  mev , as @xmath110 is increased from 0 .",
    "but , it jumps to values comparable to that of the usd model around the 4 mev gap . in order to see how this rapid transition occurs , fig .",
    "[ fig : varspe ] ( c ) shows the probability of the intruder configurations in the lowest positive - parity state for @xmath11na . as expected from the change of the moments , the dominant component of the ground state moves rapidly from intruder to normal configurations at the shell gap @xmath101  4  mev .",
    "it is interesting to compare this transition in @xmath11na with the ones of @xmath119na shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varspe ] ( c ) . compared to the pattern of @xmath11na , notable differences are that ( i ) the shell gap causing the transition is larger in @xmath49na ( @xmath124  mev ) and smaller in @xmath43na ( @xmath125  mev ) , and ( ii ) the transition takes place more slowly than @xmath11na .",
    "the former is because of the difference of the correlation energies in the normal states of @xmath112na discussed already , and the latter is because even-@xmath0 configurations are strongly connected with the pair - excited states via the pairing interaction .",
    "this is the reason why the intruder dominance in @xmath11na has a particular importance to clarify the shell structure of na isotopes , and we now confirm that the narrower shell gap due to the shell evolution @xcite plays a crucial role . note that at the gap of stable nuclei ( @xmath120  mev ) the intruder dominance does not occur even in @xmath49na .",
    "we finally discuss the competition of the dominant configurations in @xmath11na including a negative - parity state .",
    "figure  [ fig : varspe ] ( d ) displays the energies of the @xmath7- and @xmath6-dominant lowest states measured from the energy of the @xmath115-dominant state , as the gap is changed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] , we can see what happens as @xmath110 is increased from 0 .",
    "the @xmath9 state is close to the @xmath126 but stays lower consistently with experiment .",
    "if the gap is made larger , the ground state is switched to a negative - parity state around at 3.5  mev , and persists for a while .",
    "at a larger shell gap @xmath127  mev , a competition between a positive - parity state and a negative - parity one is encountered again , where the former is dominated by normal configurations . finally , after this competition the normal - dominant ground state persists .",
    "the `` island of inversion '' picture @xcite seems to correspond to the gap near the second competition ( i.e. , around 4.5 to 5  mev ) : with the weak - coupling approximation , the @xmath128 and @xmath129 states were calculated to be located at 0.306 and 0.776 mev above the normal one , respectively @xcite .",
    "the competition of normal- and abnormal - parity states in @xmath11na ( @xmath1 ) can be compared to a famous example of the parity inversion in @xmath130be ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "both are related to the narrow shell gap , but we point out a large difference between them : the latter is considered as the competition between the @xmath115 and @xmath6 states , corresponding to the second competition in the present paper .",
    "thus , in the case of the @xmath2 region a more drastic event occurs in spite of the normal - parity ground state of @xmath11na , reflecting a further narrowing of the shell gap .",
    "in summary , we have investigated where the disappearance of the magic structure starts in the isotope chain of na referring to its mechanism .",
    "it is suggested that experimental electromagnetic moments , energy levels , and @xmath75 values of @xmath11na with @xmath1 clearly indicate the dominance of the intruder configurations in its ground state , by combining with a shell - model calculation using the mcsm .",
    "the present result is in sharp contrast to a previous speculation based on the usd model @xcite from the viewpoint of the binding energy , where the disappearance was supposed to occur right at @xmath2 . the same conclusion as this speculation",
    "was drawn by the `` island of inversion '' model .",
    "the difference between the present calculation and the previous models is mainly in the behavior of the effective @xmath2 shell gap for small @xmath4 : the gap is substantially narrow ( about 3 mev ) for na isotopes with the present sdpf - m interaction .",
    "nevertheless , owing to the monopole part of the sdpf - m interaction , in particular , its spin - isospin dependent component , the well - known 6 mev gap is restored for @xmath3ca , as an example of the shell evolution in stable and unstable nuclei @xcite . the validity of this argument has been confirmed in this study quite transparently with na isotopes below @xmath2 where the intruder states are shown to be , most likely , unable to beat the normal states without a narrower shell gap .",
