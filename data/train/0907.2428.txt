    "organic bulk heterojunction solar cells have shown an increasing performance in the recent years , and also scientific progress concerning the fundamental understanding has been made.@xcite however , the dominant charge carrier loss mechanism determining the photocurrent is still under discussion .",
    "the relevant processes during which the losses can occur are geminate recombination during polaron pair dissociation@xcite , nongeminate recombination during transport of the already separated polarons@xcite , and charge extraction from the device.@xcite a detailed analysis considering the interplay of these mechanisms has still to be done , as already the separate processes are not completely described yet .",
    "concerning nongeminate recombination , classically the bimolecular langevin formalism@xcite has been used for low mobility materials .",
    "however , already in 1997 , reports on a reduced rate as compared to langevin s derivation were discussed for polaron recombination in conjugated polymers,@xcite and recently a similar reduction was found for polymer  fullerene solar cells.@xcite last year , we presented investigations of the polaron recombination in poly(3-hexyl thiophene):[6,6]-phenyl - c61 butyric acid methyl ester devices .",
    "we found a reduced recombination rate as compared to classic langevin recombination , with a bimolecular decay in pristine samples , and a third order recombination in annealed samples.@xcite the low recombination rate as well as the third order decay have been observed by other researchers as well,@xcite the origin of both effects remaining unresolved . for the third order recombination , the scenario of a carrier concentration or time dependent bimolecular recombination should be considered , and is probably related to delayed recombination due to trapping in the tail of the density of states.@xcite concerning the reduced recombination rate , two models@xcite have been proposed in literature trying to explain the reduction mechanism .",
    "however , as we pointed out recently,@xcite both fail to predict the correct temperature depenence . in this paper",
    ", we will present a simple model predicting the low bimolecular recombination rate as compared to the langevin theory , as well as its temperature dependence .",
    "before introducing our model explaining the reduced langevin recombination , let us briefly present the basic idea behind the previously published models .",
    "four different recombination models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination - scheme ] : ( a ) the classic langevin recombination , ( b ) the minimum mobility model by koster et al.@xcite , ( c ) the model by adriaenssens and arkhipov,@xcite and ( d ) our model .    in the classic langevin recombination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination - scheme](a ) ) , the derivation of which is nicely shown in the book by pope and swenberg,@xcite assumes that the rate limiting factor for recombination is the finding of the respective recombination partners ( 1 ) , and _ not _ the actual recombination rate ( 2 ) .",
    "neglecting process ( 2 ) as it is faster than ( 1 ) , the finding of electron and hole depends on the sum of their diffusivities or  considering the einstein relation  their mobilities .",
    "thus , the langevin recombination rate is @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are electron and hole concentrations , respectively , and @xmath3 is the intrinsic carrier concentration . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the langevin recombination prefactor , where @xmath5 is the elementary charge , @xmath6 the effective dielectric constant of the ambipolar semiconductor , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the electron and hole mobilities .    .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the position dependent electron and hole concentration , respectively .",
    "the details are described in the text .",
    "[ fig : recombination - scheme],width=283 ]    the model introduced by koster et al.@xcite is an extension of the langevin model .",
    "it considers an inherent property of bulk heterojunction solar cells : the phase separation of donor and acceptor materials ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination - scheme](b ) ) . under the reasonable assumption that holes are exclusively transported in the donor polymer phase , and electrons through the fullerene acceptor",
    ", a bimolecular recombination can only take place at the heterojunction .",
    "therefore , if the slower charge carrier does not reach the interface , no recombination takes place . in order to consider this behaviour , koster et al .",
    "let the recombination prefactor be governed by the minimum mobility , @xmath11    the arkhipov model  @xcite proposes that potential fluctuations in an ambipolar material are responsible for the recombination rate reduction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination - scheme](c ) ) . as",
    "the band gap remains constant , electrons and holes accumulate at the potential minima of the corresponding bands , therefore being spatially separated . in order to recombine",
    ", a potential barrier proportional to the energy difference between the minimum and maximum of the band fluctuations has to be overcome . in some respect , this model is similar to the koster model , in as far as it also accounts for a spatial separation of the recombination partners .",
    "the origin of such a spatial separation could also be due to the above mentioned donor  acceptor phase separation .",
    "the recombination prefactor in the framework of the arkhipov model is changed to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the activation energy , and @xmath14 the thermal energy .",
    "if the arkhipov model could be applied to bulk heterojunction solar cells , one would expect @xmath13 to be proportional to the energy difference between either the polymer and fullerene lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals , or between the polymer and fullerene highest occupied molecular orbitals .     in dependence on temperature .",
    "shown are the results for annealed devices of ours ( diamonds),@xcite and of juska et al .",
    "@xcite ( circles ) .",
    "the models by koster et al .",
    "@xcite ( dashed ) and arkhipov et al .",
    "@xcite ( dotted ) are also included ; they show a markedly different temperature dependence as compared to the experimental data .",
    "[ fig : zeta - exp - vs - oldmodels],width=283 ]    in our recent publication on bimolecular recombination,@xcite we simultaneously determined the time dependent carrier concentration and charge carrier mobility in a photoinduced celiv ( charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage ) experiment on pristine and annealed poly(3-hexyl thiophene):[6,6]-phenyl - c61 butyric acid methyl ester solar cells .",
    "a positive aspect of this experimental technique is that is able to determine the reduction factor @xmath15 which is the fraction of the langevin rate @xmath16 ( eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : langevin ] ) ) over the experimentally determined recombination rate @xmath17 .",
    "a similar experiment had been done previously by juska et al.@xcite from the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta - exp - vs - oldmodels ] , @xmath18 shows a negative temperature coefficient in annealed devices , increasing with decreasing temperature , thus minimizing the difference to the classic langevin rate . in constrast to the experimental findings , the arkhipov model as well as the koster model predict a positive temperature coefficient of @xmath18 , thus increasing with temperature , going asymptotically closer to the classic langevin rate ( @xmath19 ) . as a side note , in order to calculate the temperature dependence for the koster model , temperature dependent mobilities have to be used .",
    "a suitable model is the gaussian disorder model,@xcite which implies an exponentially decreasing mobility with falling temperature , depending mostly on the energetic width of the gaussian density of states , @xmath20 , also called disorder parameter . attributing different values of @xmath20 to the electron and hole transporting phases in a bulk heterojunction , which is in line with koster s assumptions , the temperature dependence of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : gamma - koster ] ) shows the behaviour as described above . only in the case of having the same disorder parameter for electrons and holes",
    "does the calculated recombination prefactor @xmath21 become temperature independent , but it never can attain the experimentally found temperature coefficient .",
    "thus , neither the juska@xcite nor the koster@xcite model can predict the temperature dependence of the recombination reduction factor @xmath18 correctly .      our model considers the discrepancy between the experimental determination of the carrier concentration by charge extraction techniques , which gives only average values , and the locally varying carrier concentration gradients found in the devices under working conditions .",
    "this difference is of particular importance for bulk heterojunction devices , which consist of an ambipolar semiconductor layer  the donor ",
    "acceptor blend  sandwiched between anode and cathode .",
    "the experimental carrier concentration yields the complete density of charge carriers @xmath22 found in the device under test conditions .",
    "when calculating the langevin recombination rate , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : langevin ] ) , usually the assumption @xmath23 is made , so that @xmath24 should fit the experimental data . however , as described above , the additional reduction factor @xmath18 had to be introduced in order to yield a good description of the experimental carrier concentration decay with time , with @xmath25 being the experimentally determined recombination rate .",
    "the problem with the above mentioned assumption of @xmath23 stems from the implicit consequence @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the distance from anode to cathode of the device . even if electrons and holes could be extracted separately , only spatial averages @xmath28 and @xmath29 were experimentally accessible",
    ". however , considering the charge carrier distribution in a bulk heterojunction device , these are not valid assumptions under most measurement conditions .",
    "a sketch of a typical electron and hole carrier concentration in a bulk heterojunction solar cell is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recombination - scheme](d ) .",
    "the strong carrier concentration gradients are indeed typical for an ambipolar device with asymmetric contacts such as a bulk heterojunction solar cells . in principle",
    ", these gradients occur in the dark case and under illumination ; in the latter case , the carrier concentration gradient is somewhat lower due to the photogeneration of electron  hole pairs , but nevertheless very relevant to the topic under discussion .",
    "the limiting factor for the recombination is still the finding of electron and hole ( 1 ) , which is proportional to the sum of the mobilities , as described above .",
    "however , now the different electron and hole concentration gradients have to be considered .",
    "the indium tin oxide ( ito ) electrode , the anode , is a good hole injection contact into conjugated polymers such as p3ht .",
    "consequently , the hole concentration of the whole device finds its maximum at this spatial position for voltages below the built - in voltage . at the same time",
    ", hole concentration at the cathode is much lower for voltages below the flat band case , in darkness and under illumination .",
    "the concentration gradients are lowered due to illumination , as the generation of electron  hole pairs throughout the bulk changes the carrier concentration mostly where it was low without light .",
    "that means that the relative increase of the hole concentration is highest in the vicinity of the cathode , despite the extraction path of the photogenerated holes being via the anode .",
    "thus , the considerations concerning the carrier concentration gradients apply to both , dark and illuminated devices . in order to calculate a recombination rate based on average carrier concentrations @xmath28 and @xmath29considering these conditions  introduces a large systematic error .    in order to better illustrate the differences arising",
    "when comparing recombination rates calculated from either average carrier concentrations or actual gradients , we devised a simple model .",
    "this model will allow us to get a better impression of the recombination reduction factor @xmath18 , and thus the origin of the seemingly reduced langevin recombination rates in ambipolar organic devices , in particular bulk heterojunction solar cells .    according to our statement ,",
    "@xmath18 can be defined as @xmath30 where the denominator corresponds to spatial averages , for instance when using carrier concentrations from charge extraction experiments .",
    "the numerator instead correctly accounts for the carrier concentration gradients found _ in _ the device under a certain applied voltage and given light intensity .    , given by eqn .",

    "two important consequences arise : first , the recombination reduction factor @xmath18 depends on all parameters changing the carrier concentration gradients , such as applied voltage and charge carrier mobility .",
    "second , @xmath18 does not directly depend on the actual recombination mechanism : no matter if the dominant recombination is monomolecular or bimolecular , or if the solar cell is illumated or not , what counts is the resulting steady state carrier concentration .    in macroscopic device simulators considering at least one space dimension ,",
    "carrier concentration gradients are already accounted for .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 does not need to be explicitly considered . on the contrary , as the simple model presented above uses very rudimentary functions to describe the carrier concentration gradients , not considering injection barriers etc . , we will apply a macroscopic simulation program in order to better understand the apparently reduced recombination under typical measurement conditions .",

    "we point out that macroscopic simulations are very useful to study organic devices such organic bulk heterojunction solar cells , despite the assumption of an effective medium . in the latter ,",
