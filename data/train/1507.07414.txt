    "the understanding of quantum impurity systems is of prime importance in condensed matter physics .",
    "such systems , consisting of a small subsystem ( the impurity ) with only few degrees of freedom coupled to a continuous bath of noninteracting particles , often exhibit rather complex behavior due to the nontrivial interplay between coulomb repulsion at the impurity site and the impurity - bath interaction . a typical example is the kondo effect @xcite describing the screening of a localized magnetic moment by conduction electrons .",
    "kondo screening mechanisms are mostly characterized by the spin susceptibility of the impurity , a fundamental quantity describing the impurity s magnetic response .",
    "quantum impurities , such as magnetic molecules , qubits , adatoms , or quantum dots , would also constitute an enormous miniaturization of data processing technology by encoding and storing information in their magnetic states @xcite .",
    "making this prospect feasible requires very accurate knowledge on the local magnetic response of the impurity .",
    "experimentally , such local magnetic properties are relevant in traditional nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretically , a prototype model of quantum impurities is the single - impurity anderson model @xcite .",
    "while exact solutions of the anderson model are available by the bethe ansatz @xcite in some limiting cases , wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite provides a systematic nonperturbative method for arbitrary impurity systems . for the impurity magnetic response in the kondo physics ,",
    "the nrg calculation of the anderson model often emphasizes wilson s definition @xcite of the impurity contribution @xmath2 to the susceptibility due to a global magnetic field ( in the following , we term it the impurity susceptibility as usual ) , rather than the standard definition @xcite of the local spin susceptibility @xmath3 in response to a local field . despite the experimental relevance ,",
    "this is because evaluation of the local susceptibility is equivalent to calculating a dynamical spin correlation function which is much more complex and less accurate in the traditional nrg @xcite or its reduced density - matrix extension @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may calculate @xmath3 by differentiating the local magnetization with respect to the external field @xcite . from a numerical point of view , however , performing differentiations is something to avoid if possible . since in the most relevant case of a flat wide band the impurity susceptibility",
    "@xmath2 exactly coincides with the local susceptibility @xmath1 , it is clearly more convenient to only calculate @xmath2 which is a thermodynamic quantity and thus can be very accurately obtained using the traditional nrg .",
    "however , the nature of the electron bath in the kondo problem varies from one realization to another . it may possess a band of strong energy dependence , as in magnetic impurities adsorbed on graphene @xcite and square lattice @xcite , double quantum dots @xcite , the narrow - band anderson model @xcite , and so on , for which the two susceptibilities may differ significantly @xcite . in this case , extreme caution",
    "should be exercised when applying wilson s definition , because the impurity susceptibility , being defined through global quantities , involves a subtlety from the conduction bath such that it may not necessarily yield the intrinsic spin dynamics of the impurity .",
    "particularly , a negative @xmath2 was found by the calculations @xcite , signaling a diamagnetic kondo impurity , even with non - fermi - liquid behavior violating the low - temperature plateau in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with one s intuition .",
    "we emphasize that in those systems @xcite , though strongly energy dependent , the conduction bands are not gapped at the fermi energy . therefore , the impurity kondo physics is very likely to be still conventional , without the exotic non - fermi - liquid and diamagnetic behaviors ( gapped bands @xcite could , of course , lead to non - fermi - liquid behavior ) . with this respect , in order to provide a definitive answer to whether an energy - dependent band without gap could indeed make the impurity diamagnetic and a non - fermi liquid , it is highly desirable to establish a dynamical method of precisely calculating the local susceptibility .",
    "this is because @xmath1 is the standard quantity @xcite that characterizes the intrinsic spin dynamics of anderson impurities in arbitrary conduction bands .",
    "recent nrg improvements of the full density - matrix ( fdm ) generalization @xcite based on the complete basis set of discarded states @xcite may fulfill this purpose .",
    "this fdm approach avoids the overcounting ambiguity and the single - shell approximation for the density matrix in the previous nrg , giving rise to very accurate dynamical correlation functions for local operators at arbitrary temperature . within the fdm algorithm , the zeroth - moment spectral sum rule holds exactly to machine precision @xcite .",
    "higher - moment spectral sum rules are also fulfilled with a high accuracy @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to wonder whether the local susceptibility , as a ( @xmath4)th moment of the impurity - spin correlation function , can be calculated accurately from the fdm method , with an accuracy even higher than the impurity susceptibility .",
    "note that the accuracy of the impurity susceptibility from the fdm , as indicated by ref.[10 ] , is only in the percent range .",
    "besides , at low temperature , there also exists a severe artifact in the fdm algorithm to @xmath2 ( detailed in sec.iii a ) .    in this paper , we apply the fdm approach to dynamically calculate the local susceptibility of an anderson impurity , without involving numerical differentiations .",
    "it is shown that within the fdm algorithm , the local susceptibility @xmath1 can be calculated very accurately in all parameter regimes , while the thermodynamic calculation of the impurity susceptibility @xmath0 encounters severe artifacts at low temperature . by comparison with exact bethe ansatz results ,",
    "the fdm results of the local susceptibility @xmath1 are found accurate in the permil range .",
    "this accuracy is obtained at much reduced computational cost , and is at least one order higher than the accuracy of the impurity susceptibility .",
    "we then revisit the previous studies @xcite , by applying the fdm algorithm for the local susceptibility @xmath1 to the case with arbitrary energy - dependent conduction bands .",
    "the revisit reaches a definitive answer : as long as the host density of states is not gapped at the fermi energy , the low - energy excitations of an anderson impurity in arbitrary energy - dependent bands are still a fermi liquid and paramagnetic .",
    "the resultant kondo screening of the impurity magnetic moment is qualitatively same as in a flat wide band . for such systems ,",
    "the exotic behaviors previously observed @xcite in the impurity susceptibility do not represent the correct kondo physics of the impurity .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the non - fermi - liquid property and diamagnetism are spurious behaviors arising from the additional susceptibility of conduction electrons , which may be vulnerable to the nrg discretization error .",
    "we consider the single - impurity anderson model described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) creates an electron with energy @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and spin @xmath11 in the bath ( impurity ) , @xmath12 , @xmath13 parametrizes the on - site coulomb repulsion , and the two subsystems are coupled via the hybridization @xmath14 .",
    "the influence of the bath on the impurity s dynamics is fully determined by the hybridization function @xmath15 , which depends on specific realizations of the electron bath . in the standard case , @xmath16 is constant for @xmath17 and zero otherwise , with @xmath18 being the half bandwidth .",
    "while @xmath18 is usually the largest energy scale of the problem , the effect of finite bandwidth becomes important in the narrow - band model @xcite . for a magnetic impurity adsorbed on the top of a carbon atom in graphene with rashba spin - orbit interaction , the resulting hybridization function of the model",
    "has a linear energy dependence with sharp discontinuities @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 may have even singularities around the fermi energy , such as for magnetic impurities in square lattice @xcite .",
    "when the single - impurity anderson model pertains to the double quantum - dot system consisting of an interacting dot coupled to the leads through another noninteracting dot , the impurity is coupled to an effective bath with a lorentzian hybridization function @xcite .",
    "following , we calculate the local spin susceptibility @xmath3 of the above anderson model with arbitrary forms of @xmath16 by using the fdm - nrg method .",
    "the nrg strategy @xcite starts from discretizing the bath spectrum on a logarithmic grid of energies @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , thereby transforming the original impurity model into a semi - infinite tight - binding chain with exponentially decreasing hopping matrix elements , via a standard tridiagonalization procedure after dropping high - mode states in each discretization interval . with its first site representing the impurity ,",
    "the chain is then diagonalized iteratively adding one site at each step . in order to restrict the exponentially growing hilbert space , eigenstates of the chain hamiltonian @xmath22 including the newly added site ( the @xmath23th site ) , are constructed from the states of the @xmath23th site and the @xmath24 lowest - lying eigenstates ( kept states ) of the chain @xmath25 without the @xmath23th site , while discarding the remaining eigenstates of @xmath25 .",
    "the iterative diagonalization proceeds until the hopping matrix element between the last added site , say @xmath26 , and its immediate neighbor becomes the smallest energy scale of the problem , such that the hamiltonian @xmath27 of the full chain represents a good approximation of the original anderson model .",
    "anders and schiller @xcite have introduced a complete basis set of the fock space of @xmath27 by constructing the tensor - product state @xmath28 from @xmath29 the @xmath30th discarded states of @xmath22 and @xmath31 the state of the @xmath32th site with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes collectively the degrees of freedom of the sites @xmath35 , i.e. , the environment of @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath36 being the first iteration at which high - energy states are discarded and taking all eigenstates of the last iteration @xmath37 as discarded , the completeness relation of the basis set @xmath38 reads as @xmath39 along with the orthonormality @xmath40 and a useful identity for the subspaces spanned by the kept states ( denoted with @xmath41 ) at iteration @xmath23 , and by all discarded states at succedent iterations @xmath42 : @xmath43 note also that for @xmath44 , the kept and discarded states are orthogonal @xmath45 . since @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is only an exact eigenstate of @xmath22 corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath48 with @xmath49-fold degeneracy , one has to assume it is also an eigenstate of the original model , @xmath50 .",
    "this so - called nrg approximation represents the only approximation of the fdm algorithm .",
    "weichselbaum and delft @xcite hence write the full density matrix @xmath51 of @xmath52 as follows : @xmath53 with @xmath54 the inverse temperature . by using this form of the density matrix ,",

    "however , the fdm algorithm for the matsubara function would involve the nrg approximation , @xmath67 , which at low temperature becomes severe @xcite because of large @xmath68 involved .    to obtain high - quality susceptibility data in the low - temperature kondo regime , it is thus better to work with the retarded green s function for which the quality of the nrg approximation does not rely on the temperature . using the kubo formula for linear response in the static limit",

    "the two types of errors are interrelated . for coarser discretization at larger @xmath118 , the discretization error increases , whereas the truncation error decreases due to the enhanced separation of energy scales .",

    "particularly , the sum - rule nature inherent in the fdm algorithm to @xmath1 makes the local susceptibility very insensitive to @xmath24 .",
    "we thus always reduce the number of kept states for calculating @xmath1 to half the number of states kept for @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , one still has to carefully choose these parameters in any practical nrg calculations such that the resultant discretization and truncation errors do not affect physical conclusions drawn from the nrg data , which should be robust to changes of parameters .",
    "we first examine the fdm - nrg calculations of the two susceptibilities for a flat conduction band [ @xmath122 in the wide - band limit ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the calculations are performed for the temperature dependence of the susceptibilities , by fixing @xmath124 while varying the on - site coulomb repulsion and the impurity level position , as shown in figs.1 and 2 and tables i and ii .",
    "even though the two susceptibilities are essentially identical in this case , one can not expect the fdm - nrg calculation would always yield equal results for them .",
    "this is because the errors inherent in nrg may affect @xmath1 and @xmath0 in different ways since different algorithms as eqs.(12 ) and ( 18 ) are adopted . for small @xmath118 and moderate",
    "@xmath24 [ fig.1(a ) ] , it is shown that at high temperatures both algorithms have introduced only tiny artifacts . but",

    "the artifacts uncovered in fig.1(a ) are mostly due to the truncation errors which can be largely reduced by increasing the discretization parameter @xmath118 . for the impurity susceptibility @xmath0",
    ", we find that using a discretization parameter as large as @xmath135 and performing the z averaging for @xmath138 meshes are necessary in order to obtain satisfactory data [ fig.1(b ) ] , in agreement with ref.[10 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "high - quality data of @xmath1 , robust to changes of the number of kept states @xmath24 and the parameter @xmath82 , are already available at moderate @xmath133 , as given in fig.1(c ) .",
    "since at this value of @xmath118 the local susceptibility @xmath1 exhibits no spurious oscillations , there is no need to carry out the z averaging .",
    "this significantly lowers the computational cost . with these nrg parameters tuned independently for @xmath1 and @xmath0 to eliminate the artifacts , the two susceptibilities plotted as @xmath125 vs @xmath128 in fig.1(d )",
    "seem indeed identical in all parameter regimes .",
    "the resultant curves exhibit features of typical kondo screening for @xmath139 , that is , @xmath125 first increasing from the high - temperature value @xmath140 of a free impurity towards its local - moment value @xmath141 for intermediate temperature , and then falling to zero as @xmath127 due to the screening of the local magnetic moment by conduction electrons .",
    "however , a severe drawback of the fdm method to @xmath0 , obscured by the very small values of @xmath142 at low temperature and thus overlooked by ref.[10 ] , is that the low - temperature artifacts appearing in @xmath0 can not be completely eliminated in all parameter regimes , even though large @xmath118 and the z averaging are used . to explicitly demonstrate this , we present by fig.2 a detailed comparison of the two susceptibilities , plotted as @xmath126 vs @xmath128 rather than @xmath125 vs @xmath128 , emphasizing the low - temperature fermi - liquid plateau .",
    "as depicted , our fdm calculation of the local susceptibility gives high - quality data for all impurity parameters , ranging from the strongly correlated to the noninteracting regime [ fig.2(a ) ] , and from the kondo to the mixed valence and into the empty - orbital regime [ fig.2(b ) ] , whereas the data of the impurity susceptibility become wildly irregular at extremely low temperature .",
    "we have checked that such kind of irregularities always show up in @xmath0 by further increasing @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and even @xmath24 .",

    "the precise origin of these irregularities is not clear at present",
    ". it may be @xcite due to an imperfect cancellation of the logarithmic discretization oscillations by the simple z - averaging procedure , or the limitations in numerical precision for calculating @xmath0 by taking the subtraction of two extensive macroscopic values to obtain an impurity - related finite quantity . in any case",
    ", the fdm gives indisputably better data quality for the local susceptibility than for the impurity susceptibility , being distinct from the conventional nrg .",

    "this poses no difficulties for the local susceptibility , because @xmath1 do indeed converge to a definite value as @xmath127 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "we thus take the zero - temperature value of @xmath1 at the lowest temperature involved in our calculation , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "however , due to its low - temperature artifacts , extracting the zero - temperature value of @xmath0 would be problematic since @xmath146 is not convergent as @xmath127 . to avoid the problem ,",
    "the zero - temperature impurity susceptibility we used in tables i and ii for comparison is actually the values of @xmath146 in the plateau region at @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the low - energy kondo scale defined by @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "comparison with the bethe ansatz results indicates a relative error of @xmath1 from the fdm in the permil range , while @xmath0 is accurate only to within a few percent .",

    "additionally , for the values of @xmath311 used in plotting fig.4(a ) , there are no sizable deviations in the local susceptibility .",

    "the narrow - band anderson model is generated by the dynamical mean field theory for the mott - hubbard transition in infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "although the two models are of interest in such different contexts , the resulting impurity properties are similar since the lorentzian band is in analogy with the narrow band in the sense that it diminishes the high - energy conduction states reducing effectively the bandwidth .",
    "previous studies @xcite within the traditional nrg show that for both models the impurity susceptibility suggests a fermi liquid ( @xmath291 , @xmath331 ) in all parameter regimes , but also a diamagnetic ( @xmath292 ) region in @xmath0 vs @xmath128 for some parameters .",

    "<S> instead , the low - energy excitations of the impurity in arbitrary bands only without gap at the fermi energy are still a fermi liquid and paramagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that unlike the traditional nrg yielding @xmath1 less accurate than @xmath0 , the fdm method allows a high - precision dynamical calculation of @xmath1 at much reduced computational cost , with an accuracy at least one order higher than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , artifacts in the fdm algorithm to @xmath0 , and origins of the spurious non - fermi - liquid and diamagnetic features are clarified . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides an efficient high - precision algorithm to calculate the spin susceptibility of impurity for arbitrary structured bands , while negating the applicability of wilson s definition to such cases . </S>"
