    "4b this lineshape change occurs below @xmath1 200 @xmath2w and @xmath1 80 @xmath2w , respectively , ( also for the sample with _ x _ = 0.05 , not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the lineshape change for _ _ p@xmath47__@xmath3 200 @xmath2w has nothing to do with the saturation phenomenon . then , in eq .",
    "1 we again force the lineshape to change in the region of low-_p@xmath47 _ adjusting the @xmath41 parameter phenomenologically .",
    "figure 8c presents , following the same procedure adopted for figure 8b , the fits to the data of figure 5b .",
    "it means that the admixture of absorption / dispersion ( @xmath41 in eq .",
    "1 ) was adjusted to fit the observed lineshape change to a pure diffusive regime ( _ _ t__@xmath30__t__@xmath13 @xmath3 1 ) .",
    "the extracted _ p@xmath47_-dependence of @xmath41 is shown in the inset of figure 8c .",
    "notice that the fits can not exactly reproduce the two minimum lateral of the resonances , although they show a change in the lineshape the same _ p@xmath47 _ ( @xmath1 100 @xmath2w ) as observed experimentally .",
    "p@xmath47 _ is well below the regime where the saturation effects start to set in ( @xmath1 5 mw ) .",
    "we believe that the inability of our fits to reproduce exactly the experimental spectra exactly may be due to the simplified phenomenological approach employed .",
    "regarding to the @xmath50-dependent esr lineshape of figure 5a , figure 9 presents the fits of the spectra to eq .",
    "1 . for these fits",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rates , 1/__t__@xmath46 , were estimated from the saturation factors@xcite of figure 6a ( see inset of fig .",
    "moreover , the _ _ t__@xmath13 and @xmath41 parameters have been forced to assume the values that best fit the observed spectra .",
    "the obtained _ t_-dependence of 1/__t__@xmath13 , 1/__t__@xmath46 and @xmath41 parameter are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "these results show that as @xmath50 increases both 1/__t__@xmath46 and 1/__t__@xmath13 increase , restoring the local fluctuating field as the ensemble of nd@xmath0 ions reach their thermal equilibrium ( unsaturated state ) .",
    "in other words , the phonon relaxation , via so coupling , restore the local fluctuating field .    now , based on the strong evidence displayed in fig . 7 that the spin lattice relaxation of the nd@xmath0 ions is controlled by the _ phonon - bottleneck phenomenon _ in the high nd@xmath0 concentration limit , we conclude that the phonon - thermal bath contact must be poor and the kapitza resistance@xcite should be relatively high in ybipt .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the abrupt change of the lineshape , from diffusionless ( @xmath41 @xmath1 0.5 @xmath29 _ _",
    "t__@xmath30__t__@xmath13 @xmath12 1 ) to diffusive ( @xmath41 @xmath1 1 @xmath29 _ _",

    "3b and 4b ) and for _ _ t__@xmath3 10 k ( figs .",
    "5a , 5b , 5c ) , is associated to with the formation of a _ long life time phonons reservoir _ due to the poor phonon - thermal bath contact within the skin depth of @xmath16 15 @xmath2 m . since the so interaction ( @xmath73**__l__@xmath63.__s__@xmath63 * * ) is an important ingredient to form a ti@xcite we argue that these _ long life time phonons _",
    "could excite the _",
    "ce _ in the metallic surface state of this ti compound via so coupling . which , in turn , deliver the microwave energy absorbed at resonance by the nd@xmath0 ions to the thermal bath .",
    "then , this combination of _ long life time phonons _ and metallic surface states plays the role of _ ce _ diffusing across the skin depth in the usual dyson theory for normal metals@xcite .",
    "figure 10 presents an illustrative route diagram indicating a plausible path ( thick solid blue arrows ) for the net flow of microwave energy absorbed at resonance reaching the thermal bath .",
    "the intriguing results of fig .",
    "3a for _ x _ = 0.10 at low-_p@xmath47 _ clearly show that a diffusionless lineshape occurs for the larger particles while for smaller ones a diffusive lineshape does .",
    "such results can be also easily simulated ( not shown ) adjusting the @xmath41 parameter in eq . 1 as done for figures 8c and 9 .",
    "notice that even for the smallest particles their size are several times larger than the skin depth .",
    "we believe that this remarkable lineshape change is due to the increase in the surface / volume ratio for the smaller particles which turns the _ long life time phonons _ interaction with the dirac _ ce _ more effective .",
    "therefore , smaller particles would favor the diffusion of the microwave energy absorbed at resonance by the nd@xmath0 ions to the thermal bath .",
    "nd@xmath7bipt ( _ x _ = 0.002 ) at _ _",

    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate , 1/__t__@xmath46 , was obtained from the saturation data of fig .",
    "5a , the spin - spin relaxation rate , 1/__t__@xmath13 , and @xmath41 were free parameters that best fit the experimental spectra . their _",
    "t_-dependence are shown in the inset .",
    "the dashed lines are guide to the eyes . ]",
    "it is also worth mentioning that our microwave photons with energy _ _",
    "@xmath75 0.5 k may promote electrons across the gap of the dirac cones , increasing the density of the _ ce _ on the surface as the microwave power increases .",
    "thus , such an increase would favor the diffusion of the microwave energy absorbed at resonance by the nd@xmath0 ions to reach the thermal bath .",
    "this _ ce _ activation can be induced by electric dipolar transitions associated with the electric component of the applied microwave@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this electronic activation may not be so relevant here because a te@xmath25 esr resonator was used in the esr experiments .",
    "this means that the sample is located at the minimum of the microwave electric field in the cavity .",
    "additionally , we should mention that we have carried out similar studies of gd@xmath0 in y@xmath6gd@xmath7bipt for 0.01 @xmath15 0.05 .",
    "saturation effects at high microwave power , change of the esr lineshape below @xmath1 100 mw and _ phonon - bottleneck effects _ , similar to those of nd@xmath0 were also observed .",
    "however , describing the details of the gd@xmath0 esr in ybipt is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "finally , we believe that the results presented here will help to shed new light on the experimental characterization of the surface metallic states in ti materials . in particular , this work should motivate further esr work in other ti materials .",
    "however , it is possible that the effects of the surface states would be favored to be observable by esr in the presence of a _ phonon - bottleneck _ regime .",
    "the systematic esr study of the nd@xmath0 @xmath65@xmath66 kramer doublet ( s@xmath67 = 1/2 ) cef ground state in the cubic noncentrosymmetric half heusler semiconductor / semimetallic compound y@xmath6nd@xmath7bipt revealed that this system presents , simultaneously , metallic and insulating features .",
    "this dual character was verified by the saturation effects and relaxation processes observed on the dysonian ( metallic lineshape ) of the nd@xmath0 esr spectra .",
    "also , our phenomenological approach to analyze the esr lineshape suggests that saturation effects do affect the local fluctuation field and contribute to slow down the effective spin - spin relaxation rate , 1/__t__@xmath13 , i.e. , narrowing down the inhomogeneous esr linewidth .    moreover , the dramatic evolution of the lineshape between diffusionless ( a / b @xmath3 2.6 @xmath29 _ _ t__@xmath30__t__@xmath13 @xmath31 1 ) and diffusive regimes ( a / b @xmath12 2.6 @xmath29 _ _",
    "t__@xmath30__t__@xmath13 @xmath3 1 ) at microwave powers below @xmath1 200 @xmath2w , where no saturation effects are observed , strongly suggests that this peculiar behavior is caused by a subtle combination between the increasing presence of the _ phonon - bottleneck process _ ( as the nd@xmath0 concentration increases ) and the highly conducting metallic surface of this ti material .",
    "finally , we conclude that the _ phonon - bottleneck process _ allows the observation of several striking features on the nd@xmath0 esr metallic linshape behavior within a skin depth of @xmath16 15 @xmath2 m in ybipt , supporting the 3dti character of this compound .",
    "we argue that the _ phonon - bottleneck process _ allowed the formation of _ long life time phonons reservoir _ where these phonons , via so interaction , couple to highly mobile dirac _ ce _ at the fermi level that , finally , deliver the microwave energy absorbed at resonance by the nd@xmath0 ions to the thermal bath .",
    "we have also mentioned that electromagnetically excited electrons across the fermi level at the dirac cones by our low energy microwave photons may contribute to facilitate the observation of the diffusive effect of the nd@xmath0 esr lineshape in y@xmath6nd@xmath7bipt , although this contribution may not be so relevant due to our experimental configuration .",
