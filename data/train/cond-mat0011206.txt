    "this because , in average , the wave vector @xmath12 of the excited electron becomes scattered in the @xmath241 direction , even though the size @xmath211 of @xmath241 is about an order of magnitude larger than the difference @xmath242 .",
    "the vector @xmath239 changes a sign , if the cross section is orthogonal to the ( 1,-1,0 ) direction , proving zero current for a homogeneous distribution .",
    "because of the symmetry specified above , we can limit calculations to one quarter of the brillouin zone .",
    "note that @xmath239 is larger in the horizontal direction , where the squeezed population in fig.[kral2 ] is also larger , so that @xmath243 becomes increased .    in fig.[kral4]a",
    ", we present contributions to @xmath243 from different electron levels in the conduction band , as induced by phonon scattering @xcite .",
    "the temperature is @xmath228 k , and the dashed , solid and dash - dotted lines correspond to the light excitation at the energies corresponding to the levels @xmath244 ( used the same injection rate ) .",
    "the three results are very different , since the shift vector @xmath239 and , consequently , @xmath243 changes sign around level @xmath229 ( see also fig.[kral5 ] ) .",
    "this effect is related to the form of matrix elements , and it appears by chance close to the level @xmath229 .",
    "the contributions to the current density @xmath243 are summed and presented in fig.[kral4]b in the range @xmath245 k. the excitation energies are labeled by the level number @xmath246 . in this interval the response changes sign , as expected from fig.[kral4]a .",
    "@xmath243 is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath231 , but it increases for larger excitation energies ( see fig.[kral5 ] ) . for excitation around @xmath229 ,",
    "@xmath243 is nearly temperature independent , while away from @xmath229 it grows in size with @xmath57 .",
    "in general the increase is small , since @xmath243 depends weakly on the scattering strength ( see discussion at eqn.([jst ] ) ) .    in fig.[kral5 ] , we show the dependence of the ratio @xmath247 on the excitation energy , labeled as in fig.[kral4]b .",
    "as already mentioned , the ratio is negative close to the @xmath248 point , it changes sign around @xmath229 and approaches @xmath249 at @xmath250 .",
    "here we stop our calculations , since the departure from the parabolic band approximation is large .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves correspond to @xmath228 k ( @xmath251 k ) . since @xmath231 roughly increases by @xmath252 in this energy region , @xmath243 is responsible for the increased value in the ratio .",
    "note also that at higher excitation energies the current density @xmath243 is _ opposite _ to @xmath231 , which could be intuitively expected .",
    "the ratio can be larger for relaxation to / from local side minima in the band structure .",
    "finally , let us shortly discuss the recombination current density @xmath6 . since the momentum relaxation time @xmath253 is several hundreds fs , and the recombination time @xmath254 is about 1 ns , only a tinny fraction of carriers recombine before randomizing their momenta .",
    "the hot carriers first isotropically fill the brillouin zone , and in particular the distribution is practically the same in the ( 1,1,0 ) and ( 1,-1,0 ) directions .",
    "it is good to recognize that @xmath4 and @xmath6 resulting from transitions between two particular states have opposite signs .",
    "therefore , contributions to @xmath6 from the population in the above directions are the same in magnitude , but they point in the ( 0,0,-1 ) and ( 0,0,1 ) directions .",
    "this means that @xmath6 is practically zero , as suggested in fig.[kral1]b , where the recombining electrons going from ga atoms do not distinguish between the as atoms .",
    "the same observation is expressed in ref.@xcite in a more general way , namely , that @xmath6 is zero in non - pyroelectric materials .",
    "recombination through trap sites from impurities would give nonzero _",
    "microscopic _ shift currents , but its macroscopic value @xmath6 averaged over all impurity positions should be negligible .",
    "it would be also interesting to study the shift current related with transitions to excitonic levels .",
    "since these levels are energetically below the band edge , it can be expected that they give different ( smaller ) shifts in real space than in the interband transitions .",
    "these shifts would also vary level from level , and @xmath6 could be also nonzero .",
    "we have theoretically investigated laser beam generation of the shift current density in bulk ncs semiconductors .",
    "the excitation , scattering and recombination components @xmath75 reflect _ asymmetric carrier flows _ in elementary cells , induced by the relevant processes .",
    "the system was described by the ngf methods , which , in combination with the length gauge , gives a consistent approach to this problem .",
    "expressions for @xmath255 were derived for steady - state excitations , in terms of the carrier transition rates and the space shift vectors @xmath256 .    for practical purposes ,",
    "we have simplified the formalism to the boltzmann limit and demonstrated a tractable numerical scheme . within this approximation ,",
    "we have described optically excited gaas in the presence of lo phonon scattering .",
    "light induced electron transitions between the lowest conduction band and the nearest heavy hole bands were considered . for light polarized in the ( 1,1,0 ) direction , the excitation current density @xmath4 in the ( 0,0,-1 ) direction was obtained .",
    "the scattering current density @xmath257 was calculated from the hot - electron distribution in the conduction band .",
    "it is about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath4 , and the recombination current density @xmath258 can be neglected , since the momentum relaxation causes that electrons recombine with the same strength to atoms placed in opposite directions .",
    "therefore , _ steady - state pumping _ of electrons across the crystal can be realized .",
    "the shift current has potential applications in ultrafast photo - electric devices , since the response is practically instantaneous .",
    "modifications of the shift current might be observed in low dimensional structures , heteropolar nanotubes @xcite or molecular systems .",
    "+ the author would like thank j. e. sipe for many discussions of the problem studied and a financial support provided by photonic research ontario .",
    "he acknowledges b. adolf and a. shkrebtii for evaluation of _ ab - initio _ matrix elements .",
    "the work was greatly improved with the help of k. busch and with comments of a. p. jauho .",
    "let us first compare current expressions from ref.@xcite with our results .",
    "the sum of the term @xmath259 and @xmath260 , there , corresponds to the excitation shift current density @xmath4 from our eqn.([jsh ] ) , if scattering is neglected .",
    "the term @xmath261 there corresponds to the excitation part of the ballistic current ; eqn.([jsh ] ) with equal bands @xmath77 , and no transport vertex corrections to @xmath262 .",
    "next , we show how eqn.([je2 ] ) can be obtained from eqn.([je1 ] ) , in analogy to ref.@xcite .",
    "two situations can be considered in ( [ je1 ] ) , where either one of the two involved field self - energies @xmath263 is interband and the other is intraband , or both of them are interband . in the first case , the _ interband _ self - energy in eqn.([je1 ] ) is between the two green functions , since these are from different bands ( empty / full ) , to give real transitions .",
    "the _ intraband _ self - energy in front or back can be switched by partial integration ( see comment at ( [ sf ] ) ) to give a derivative , with a prefactor @xmath63 , over the front or back variable in the first or second term in eqn.([je1 ] ) with @xmath264 .",
    "these two can be combined into a derivative @xmath265 , and transferred by partial integration to the derivative in the prefactor @xcite @xmath266 . the resulting contribution to @xmath4 in ( [ je1 ] )",
    "is @xmath267 where we employ the definition @xcite @xmath268 in ( [ je1a ] ) the sum over bands @xmath269 selects real transitions between valence and conduction bands , tuned by the laser frequency @xmath3 .",
    "then , the top ( bottom ) signs correspond to @xmath148 , @xmath149 ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) .",
    "the second situation adds the expression @xmath270 $ ] to the bracket @xmath271 in ( [ je1a ] ) .",
    "these terms can be largely simplified with the following identity @xcite @xmath272\\ , \\label{ident}\\ ] ] which can be used to exchange the vector ( b ) and derivative ( a ) components in @xmath273 . if we substitute ( [ ident ] ) in ( [ je1a ] ) , and shift arguments , then the square brackets cancel and the expression ( [ je2 ] ) results .",
    "here we derive the expression for the intraband scattering shift vector @xmath191 , used in eqn.([jst ] ) , and linearize it in the wave vector difference @xmath192 .",
    "we assume @xcite that the commutator of the operator @xmath7 in ( [ xdefi ] ) and @xmath274 in ( [ mkk ] ) vanishes , _ i.e _ , @xmath275 = 0 $ ] . in the bloch representation",
    ", we can easily sum over intermediate states and momenta . upon separating out the terms of the position operator that are band - diagonal , we arrive at the following sum rule :    @xmath276 @xmath277 aided with eqn.([sumrule ] ) and writing the matrix elements @xmath278 in the form @xmath279 it is now straightforward to simplify the bracketed terms in eqn.([js2 ] ) for @xmath86 : @xmath280 @xmath281 here the @xmath88-component of the scattering shift vector @xmath282 is @xmath283 it has properties similar to the excitation shift vector @xmath284 in ( [ rsh ] ) .",
    "@xmath285 is invariant under phase transforms of bloch functions , and anti - symmetric upon exchanging @xmath12 and @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath286 , which follows directly from eqn.([mphi ] ) .",
    "therefore , the real ( first ) part in eqn.([rsd ] ) is also anti - symmetric , while the imaginary ( second ) part is symmetric , and these two give different contributions to the scattering shift current density @xmath41 .",
    "numerically , it is more convenient to evaluate the shift vector directly from from the matrix elements @xmath287 , which are accessible to _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "then , considerable care has to be exerted in order to maintain the invariance under phase transformations .",
    "we make use of the specific form of @xmath288 , with the structure factors @xmath289 given in eqn.([mkk ] ) , to evaluate @xmath290 from @xmath291 \\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\xi_{\\beta \\beta}^c({\\bf k}^ { ' } ) - \\xi_{\\beta \\beta}^c({\\bf k})\\ . \\label{rsnew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath289 only depends on the band structure , it is clear that the shift vector @xmath292 is an _ intrinsic property of the material _ and does not depend on the nature of the scattering mechanism .",
    "eqn.([rsnew ] ) can be used once @xmath293 are found . for practical evaluations",
    "it is much easier to obtain their linearized form in the difference @xmath192 .",
    "we can evaluate @xmath294 and @xmath295 as well as their derivatives from @xmath296 at @xmath297 using @xmath298-perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain corresponding perturbation theoretical expressions for @xmath299 , @xmath300 and the shift vector @xmath301 .    the linearized @xmath294 results in the form @xmath302 where @xmath303 .",
