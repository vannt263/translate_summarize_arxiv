    "the maximum total surface density present in the disk during this process is the critical active layer surface density , @xmath128 .",
    "if the critical active layer s surface density is small , then the planets will not move far during this process . however , a large critical surface density may be sufficient for a super  earth to migrate into the sun .",
    "we therefore find that there is a delicate balance between the need for a sufficiently large surface density in the active layer for the planets to migrate into the star , but also a small enough active layer surface density to allow the planets to form _ in situ _ in the first place .    for the super  earth to migrate into the sun",
    ", it must do so on a timescale shorter than the viscous timescale ( the timescale for the disk to accrete ) .",
    "equating equations  ( [ type1 ] ) and  ( [ tvisc ] ) we find that the minimum surface density in the disk for the planet to migrate in to the sun is @xmath129 now , if @xmath130 then we expect that super",
    " earths that form _ in situ _ will migrate into the sun at the end of the disk lifetime . on the other hand , if @xmath131 then there may be some type  i migration , but not enough to allow the super  earth to be accreted .",

    "for example , if the disk aspect ratio is decreased by a factor of two , down to @xmath132 , then we find that @xmath133 .",
    "we speculate that in our solar system , super ",
    "earths formed in the inner parts of a relatively cool disk , close to the dead zone inner boundary .",
    "there was sufficient time for them to migrate through the disk to be accreted on to the sun . while this outcome is less likely because of the cool conditions required , it is definitely not impossible and should happen in other planetary systems also .",
    "we note that an alternative mechanism for pushing the super ",
    "earths into the sun is the grand tack @xcite . in this model",
    ", jupiter migrates inwards to @xmath134 before it gets locked into resonance with saturn and then they both move outwards to their current locations . during this process",
    "the innermost super - earths get shepherded in to the sun .",
    "our disk model which includes a dead zone also provides an alternative explanation for the cleared inner regions of our solar system and the lack of super  earths .",
    "furthermore , the small masses of mercury and mars can be explained if the terrestrial planets form from a narrow annulus of rocky debris in the orbital range @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "our model can explain the inner truncation radius for this annulus as being where the super ",
    "earths cleared the material .",
    "the mmen is criticized because of the unusually high amount of material required for the _ in situ _ formation of super  earths .",
    "however , sub - mm observations of disks measure the properties of the outer disk while the inner parts of the disk are not very well constrained . furthermore",
    ", @xcite suggest that _ in situ _ formation can not operate unless type  i migration is suppressed in the region inside of @xmath16 . a disk model with a dead zone ( such as the one proposed in this work ) not only provides sufficient material , but it also suppresses the rate of migration in that region .",
    "@xcite argue that super ",
    "earths could not have formed _ in situ_. they use observations of systems that contain three or more planets to construct an mmen and find that the surface density profile @xmath136 has @xmath137 .",
    "they suggest that because viscous accretion disk models have difficulty in reproducing such extreme profiles that the super  earths could not have predominantly formed _ in situ_. these conclusions are based on a steady state disk model with the temperature profile dominated by stellar irradiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we suggest that the extreme values could be a result of a discontinuous surface density distribution brought about by the presence of a dead zone . in the dead zone material",
    "builds up and the surface density in the innermost mri active parts of the disk may be significantly lower than that farther out in the dead zone .",
    "if this is the case , then one can not smooth the profile from three planets out to a continuous surface density distribution .",
    "consequently , the most important factor is the amount of material in the inner regions available for planet formation , rather than its distribution .",
    "because planets that form _ in situ _ are expected to require an unusually large amount of solids in the inner parts of the disk , the prediction is that the metallicity of the host star must be higher in such cases .",
    "@xcite found that close - in super - earths are more likely to be found around metal - rich stars .",
    "similarly , the widely separated super - earths are more often around metal  poor stars . as metal - rich stars have more solid material closer to the star within the disk , this appears to favour the _ in situ _ formation .",
    "however , there may be be two populations of super  earths because there is a distinct transition in orbital period observed , rather than a smooth transition .",
    "@xcite proposed a mechanism to form the close in super  earths at the pressure trap at the inner edge of a dead zone , known as inside  out planet formation .",
    "once a planet forms there , the inner edge of the dead zone moves out allowing planet formation further out @xcite .",
    "this model requires a high rate of supply of pebbles to the inner disk .",
    "we suggest that a dead zone model can provide all the required material for planet formation without the need for accumulation .",
    "however , the inside  out planet formation mechanism potentially increases the range of possible dead zone parameters that are able to form the super  earths _ in situ_.    in this work we have considered only the formation of super  earth planets during the gas disk lifetime .",
    "it is entirely possible that some super  earth planets may form after the gas disk has dissipated and we expect these to have a high density , similar to the terrestrial planets in our solar system .",
    "however , this is not the only mechanism to form high density super  earths .",
    "a super  earth that forms in a dead zone with a small active layer will not accrete much material once it has carved out a gap",
    ". the only accretion on to the planet is through the active layer .",
    "thus , planets that form within a dead zone are likely to be less gaseous and more dense than planets that form farther out in a fully turbulent disk and migrate inwards .",
    "this may explain the weak dependence of density on semi  major axis observed in fig .  1 . however , the gaseous atmosphere of a close  in super  earth could be stripped from the planet , by tidal evolution or evaporation , leaving only the solid core behind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently ,",
    "as we can not tell the difference between these two mechanisms in the observed exoplanets , it is difficult to make firm conclusions as to which super  earths form by which mechanism",
    ". nevertheless , the existence of these different mechanisms may explain the range in the densities .",
    "there are two possible formation locations for observed close  in super  earths in exoplanetary systems : either _ in situ _ , or farther away from the star followed by migration to their observed location .",
    "we find that a disk that contains a dead zone ( a region of low turbulence ) may have sufficient material for the planets to form _ in situ _ although it depends upon the dead zone parameters . in order for the dead zone to last long enough for super  earths to form , the active layer surface density must be sufficiently low , @xmath138 .",
    "if the active layer surface density is too large , the disk becomes fully turbulent before there is sufficient time to form the super  earths .",
    "migration of super  earths through a dead zone is very slow and thus formation farther out in a disk with a dead zone is more difficult .",
    "we find that a fully turbulent protoplanetary disk model does not have sufficient material in the inner parts of the disk for _ in situ _ formation of super  earths . in this case , the only possible formation mechanism involves migration from farther out in the disk . the fast rate of migration in a fully turbulent disk lends itself to this scenario .",
    "we suggest that the observed large range in super  earth compositions may be the result of these two very different formation locations .",
    "the lack of super  earths in our solar system is somewhat puzzling given that more than half of observed exoplanetary systems contain one .",
    "however , the fact that there is nothing inside of mercury s orbit may not be a coincidence .",
    "_ in situ _ formation of super  earths in that region could have cleared the solid material .",
    "the super  earths would have had to subsequently fall into the sun .",
    "this is possible if the active layer surface density is sufficiently large that during the final accretion process there was enough material in the disk for the planets to migrate into the sun . in order to satisfy both this constraint , and the constraint that the dead zone must last throughout the disk lifetime ,",
    "requires a sufficiently cool disk during the final accretion process .",
    "the level of fine  tuning required is certainly possible , but we do nt expect it to happen in all systems and this can explain why the solar system is somewhat special in its lack of super  earths .",
