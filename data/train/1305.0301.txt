    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] , we can have the negative differential sse : when increasing the temperature difference @xmath119 , instead of observing an increasing spin current as in linear response regime , we get a decreasing and even vanishing spin current from the right magnetic insulator to the left metallic lead . </S>",
    "<S> it is readily to prove that when @xmath120 , @xmath121 is always positive so that the negative differential sse is absent in this parameter regime , as shown by cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](b ) shows that the negative differential sse also exists for a wide range of temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of negative differential sse can be reasoned as follows : when @xmath122 , the thermal bias drives spin current from the right to the left . </S>",
    "<S> if near the linear response regime , it is natural to have a positive differential sse that lowering @xmath39 will increase the thermal bias which in turn increases the spin current . </S>",
    "<S> if we further decrease @xmath39 with assuming two levels are both above ( below ) the chemical potential , the two states will be both depleted ( occupied ) , which in turn severely suppresses the magnon emission / absorption process that requires the concurrence of one occupied and one empty state . as a consequence , the seebeck spin conductance will decrease although the thermal bias increases . </S>",
    "<S> when the conductance decreases faster than the increasing of the bias , the negative differential sse emerges .    in summary , we have uncovered the rectification and negative differential sse in the metal - insulating magnet interface , as a consequence of the strongly - fluctuated electron dos of the metallic lead . </S>",
    "<S> we then have exemplified the identification of these intriguing spin seebeck properties in several typical cases . since the magnon carries not only spin but also energy , we additionally possess the rectification and negative differential thermal conductance , as in dielectric phononics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that throughout the work , we have ensured the condition @xmath123 so that the noninteracting magnon picture assumed in the theory is valid . in fact , in a following work we have shown that the high - order magnon - magnon interaction even becomes crucial for the manifestation of asymmetric and negative differential sse in magnon tunneling junctions  @xcite , based on which the concept of a functional spin seebeck transistor is illustrated . </S>",
    "<S> if considering the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition , the rectification and negative differential sse will be enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> our findings can also be readily generalized to the interfaces of metal - magnetic metal / semiconductor or the ferromagnetic metal - magnetic insulator interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> since recent studies imply the important role of phonon - drag in sse @xcite , taking account of the effect of nonequilibrium phonons on rectification and negative differential sse would be an interesting topic . by integrating the phononics  @xcite with spintronics  @xcite , magnonics  @xcite and spin caloritronics  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we expect to invigorate more opportunities to achieve the smart control of energy and information in low - dimensional nanodevices .    </S>",
