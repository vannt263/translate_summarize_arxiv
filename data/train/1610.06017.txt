    "vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics effects is an object that piques a great interest in contemporary physics @xcite .",
    "first of all it is related to the emerging opportunities of experimental research in terrestrial conditions using extreme laser facilities like extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) @xcite , helmholtz international beamline for extreme fields ( hibef ) @xcite .",
    "it opens up new possibilities in fundamental physics tests @xcite with an extremal electromagnetic field intensities and particle accelerations that have never been obtained before .    at the same time investigation of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics effects in astrophysics gives us an additional opportunity to carry out a versatile research using natural extreme regimes of strong electromagnetic and gravitational fields with intensities unavailable yet in laboratory conditions .",
    "compact astrophysical objects with a strong field , such as pulsars and magnetars are best suited for vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics researches .",
    "nowadays , there are many vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics effects predicted in the pulsar s neighborhood . for example",
    "vacuum electron - positron pairs production @xcite and photon splitting  @xcite , photon frequency doubling @xcite , light by light scattering and vacuum birefringence @xcite , transient radiation ray bending @xcite and normal waves delay @xcite . some of predicted effects are indirectly confirmed by astrophysical observations .",
    "for instance the evidence of the absence of the high - field ( surface fields more then @xmath0 ) radio loud pulsars can be explained by pair - production suppression due to photon splitting @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics corrections to electromagnetic radiation of rapidly rotating pulsar and analyze pulsar spin - down under these corrections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we present vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics models and discuss their main physical properties and predictions . in sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] pulsar radiation in post - maxwellian approximation is calculated .",
    "[ sect4 ] is devoted to analysis of pulsar spin - down under vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence . in the last section",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "modern theoretical models of nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics suppose that electromagnetic field lagrange function density @xmath1 depends on both independent invariants @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath4 .",
    "the specific relationship between lagrange function and the invariants depends on theoretical model choice . nowadays",
    "the most promising models are born - infeld and heisenberg - euler electrodynamics .",
    "born - infeld electrodynamics is a phenomenological theory originating from the requirement of self - energy finiteness for pointlike electrical charge @xcite . in subsequent studies ,",
    "the attempts of quantization were performed @xcite and also it was revealed that born - infeld theory describes dynamics of electromagnetic fields on d - branes in string theory @xcite . as the main features of born - infeld electrodynamics one can note the absence of birefringence ( however there are modifications of the born - infeld theory @xcite with the vacuum birefringence predictions ) and dichroism for electromagnetic waves propagating in external electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this theory has a distinctive feature  the value of electric field depends on the direction of approach to the point - like charge .",
    "this property was noted by the authors of the theory and also eliminated by them in the subsequent model development@xcite .",
    "lagrangian function in born - infeld electrodynamics has the following form : @xmath5}-1\\big\\ } , \\label{eqna}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a characteristic constant of theory , the inverse value of which has a meaning of maximum electric field for the point - like charge . for this constant only the following estimation",
    "is known : @xmath7 g@xmath8 .",
    "the other nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics  heisenberg - euler model @xcite was derived in quantum field theory and describes one - loop radiative corrections caused by vacuum polarization in strong electromagnetic field . unlike born - infeld electrodynamics ,",
    "this theoretical model possess vacuum birefringent properties in strong field .",
    "effective lagrangian function for heisenberg - euler theory has the following form : @xmath9d\\sigma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the value of characteristic field in quantum electrodynamics , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath13  fine structure constant and for brevity we use the notations @xmath14    @xmath15    many attempts to find out the experimental status for each of these theories were taken for a long time , but nowadays it still remains ambiguous .",
    "there are experimental evidences in favor of each of them .",
    "heisenber - euler electrodynamics predictions were experimentally proved in delbrck light - by - light scattering @xcite , nonlinear compton scattering @xcite , schwinger pair production in multiphoton scattering @xcite . at the same time the recent astrophysical observations @xcite point on the absence of vacuum birefringence effect which favors the born - infeld theory prediction .",
    "the measurements performed for the speed of light in vacuum show that it doestn depend on wave polarization with the accuracy @xmath16 .",
    "so clarification of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics status requires the expansion of the experimental test list both in terrestrial and astrophysical conditions .",
    "the main hopes on this way are assigned to the experiments with ultra - high intensity laser facilities @xcite and astrophysical experiments with x - ray polarimetry @xcite in pulsars and magnetars neighborhood .",
    "as it follows from lagrangians ( [ bi_lagr])-([he_lagr ] ) vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence becomes valuable only in  strong electromagnetic fields comparable to @xmath17 for born - infeld theory and @xmath18 for heisenberg - euler electrodynamics @xcite . in case of relatively weak fields ( @xmath19 )",
    "the exact expressions ( [ bi_lagr ] ) and ( [ he_lagr ] ) can be decomposed and written @xcite in the form of unified parametric post - maxwellian lagrangian :    @xmath20\\big\\},\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 , and the post - maxwellian parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend on choice of theoretical model . in case of heisenberg - euler electrodynamics",
    "post - maxwellian parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are coupled to fine structure constant @xmath24 @xcite :    @xmath25    for born - infeld electrodynamics these parameters are equal to each other and can be expressed through the field induction @xmath26 typical of this theory @xcite : @xmath27 the electromagnetic field equations for the post - maxwellian vacuum electrodynamics with the lagrangian ( [ pm_lagr ] ) are equivalent @xcite to equations of maxwell electrodynamics of continuous media @xmath28 @xmath29 with specific nonlinear constitutive relations @xcite : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the third power of the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "tensor @xmath32 can be separated into two terms @xmath33 , one of which @xmath34 will have a meaning similar to substance polarization tensor in electrodynamics of continuous media .    also it should be noted that in post - maxwellian approximation stress - energy tensor @xmath35 and pointing vector @xmath36 have a form : @xmath37\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38f_{(2)}^{0\\mu},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the second power of the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath40  is the metric tensor and the greek index takes a value @xmath41 .    as it was shown in @xcite that post - maxwellian approximation turns out to be very convenient for vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics analysis ,",
    "so we will use this representation ( [ pm_eq_hom])-([point ] ) to calculate radiation of the rapidly rotating pulsar .",
    "pulsars are the compact objects best suited for vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics tests in astrophysics .",
    "they possess sufficiently strong magnetic field with the strength varying from @xmath42 up to @xmath43 , so as this values are close to @xmath44 the vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence can be manifested . at the same time",
    ", the pulsar s fast rotation may enhance nonlinear influence on its radiation .",
    "let us consider a pulsar of radius @xmath45 , rotating around an axis passing through its center with the angular velocity @xmath46 .",
    "we shall suppose that the rotation is fast enough , so the linear velocity for the points on the pulsar s surface is comparable to speed of light @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that pulsar s magnetic dipole moment @xmath48 is inclined to the rotation axis at the angle @xmath49 , therefore cartesian coordinates of this vector varies under rotation as @xmath50 .",
    "as the vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence in post - maxwellian approximation has the character of a small correction to maxwell theory one can represent the total electromagnetic field tensor @xmath51 in form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electromagnetic field tensor of the rotating magnetic dipole @xmath54 in maxwell electrodynamics and @xmath55  is the vacuum nonlinear correction . substituting ( [ fik_tot ] ) in to ( [ const_rel ] ) and retaining only the terms linear in small value @xmath55 it can be found that : @xmath56 where @xmath57  polarization tensor calculated in approximation of the maxwell electrodynamics field @xmath58 .",
    "electromagnetic field equations ( [ pm_eq_hom])-([pm_eq_nhom ] ) with the account of ( [ fik_tot])-([qik_lin ] ) then will take a form : @xmath59 the solution of these equation may be obtained by successive approximation method . in initial approximation",
    "we assume that @xmath60 is the solution of maxwell electrodynamics equations @xmath61 corresponding to rotating magnetic dipole @xmath54 , current density for which @xmath62 is represented in right hand side of these equations .",
    "in this case , from ( [ total_sys ] ) follows that vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics corrections @xmath63 my be obtained as a solution of linearized equations : @xmath64 to satisfy homogeneous equation ( [ ned_hom ] ) electromagnetic potential @xmath65 should be introduced @xmath66 .",
    "using this potential the inhomogeneous equation ( [ ned_nhom ] ) under the lorentz gauge will take a form @xmath67 it is more convenient to rewrite the last equation in terms of the antisymmetric hertz tensor @xmath68 defined as : @xmath69 in this case equation ( [ pot_eq ] ) will take a simple form @xmath70 where @xmath71  is dalembert operator .",
    "six independent equations in ( [ hertz_pot_eq ] ) may be expressed in vector form by introducing hertz electric @xmath72 and magnetic @xmath73 potentials @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75  levi - civita symbol and all of the indexes take values @xmath76 . in terms of these potentials equations ( [ hertz_pot_eq ] ) can be rewritten : @xmath77 where the source vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 are expressed from polarization tensor @xmath80 by equalities : @xmath81 the explicit components of these vectors may be easily obtained in minkowski space - time with the using of ( [ const_rel ] ) and ( [ pm_vec ] ) : @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the electromagnetic field components of the rotating magnetic dipole in maxwell electrodynamics , the expressions for which are well described in literature @xcite and the field vectors themselves have the form : @xmath86 @xmath87\\over c r^3}+ { [ { \\bf r},\\ddot{\\bf m}(\\tau)]\\over c^2 r^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the retarded time and the dot corresponds to the derivative of the magnetic dipole moment @xmath89 with the respect to the retarded time @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the right hand side of the equations ( [ hertz_vect_eq ] ) can be obtained by using of ( [ p0])([e0 ] ) .",
    "the equations ( [ hertz_vect_eq ] ) themselves are the unhomogeneous hyperbolic equations the exact solution methods of which are well developed and described in literature @xcite .",
    "since we are interested only with the radiative solutions for the pulsar s field , when solving equations ( [ hertz_vect_eq ] ) one should retain only the terms decreasing not faster than @xmath91 with the distance to the pulsar . at the same time there is no restrictions on the rotational velocity so @xmath92 .",
    "due to excessive unwieldiness here we will not represent the whole solutions for the hertz potentials @xmath72 and @xmath73 , but we will use the results for them to find the components of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath63 and radiation properties such as pointing vector @xmath93 and tonal intensity @xmath94 .",
    "the pointing vector components represented by ( [ point ] ) in post - maxwellian electrodynamics , can be simplified by the radiative asymptotic condition @xmath95 which actually means that for radiation description we can use the maxwellian expression for this vector : @xmath96 finally , the total intensity can be obtained by integrating of pointing vector by the surface with the normal @xmath97 directed to the observer located at the large distance @xmath98 from the pulsar : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the solid angle .",
    "solutions of equations ( [ hertz_vect_eq ] ) with the right hand side ( [ p0 ] ) ,  ( [ m0 ] ) lead to the following expression for the pulsar radiation intensity : @xmath101 \\nonumber\\\\ * & & \\times ci(2 y)\\sin^2\\theta_0 + 4y^9\\big [ \\eta_2-\\frac{311}{45}\\eta_1 \\big]ci(2 y )   \\nonumber\\\\ * & & + y^3\\big[\\frac{\\eta_1 - 15\\eta_2}{5 } ( 2y^4 - 3y^2 ) - 18\\eta_1 -10\\eta_2\\big]\\cos(2y ) \\sin^2 \\theta_0 \\nonumber\\\\ * & & + \\frac{y}{6}\\big[\\frac{45\\eta_2 - 311\\eta_1}{15 } ( 2y^6 - 3y^4)+(172\\eta_1- 60\\eta_2)y^2 \\nonumber\\\\ * & & - 336\\eta_1 \\big]\\cos(2y ) + y^2\\big [ \\frac{30\\eta_2 -2\\eta_1}{5 } ( 2y^6-y^4)\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{41\\eta_1 + 85\\eta_2 } { 5}y^2",

    "it is obvious that obtained intensity can be represented in form which distinguishes maxwell radiation intensity and vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics correction . in this representation",
    "it is convenient to introduce the `` correction function '' @xmath106 which is a multiplier before the scaling factor @xmath107 determining how strong the vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence on the pulsar radiation is : @xmath108 for the most known rapidly rotating pulsars @xcite with @xmath109 the factor @xmath110 is small which matches the requirements of post - maxwellian approximation . at the same time",
    "this means that vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics corrections will be sufficiently suppressed in comparison with maxwell electrodynamics radiation .",
    "however , this assessment may be waived for special sources of so called fast radio bursts ( frb s ) , six cases of which have recently been discovered @xcite .",
    "one of the hypotheses explaining the nature of frbs assumes that their source is a rapidly rotating neutron star with the strong surface magnetic field @xmath111 called blitzar @xcite . in this case vacuum",
    "nonlinear electrodynamics corrections to pulsar radiation became significant but at the same time this makes strict solution ( [ i_total ] ) unapplicable because it was obtained in low - field limit . so our further evaluations will be applied to the case of the typical rapidly rotating pulsar , for instance psr b1937 + 21 with @xmath112 , and maybe for blitzars but with the restriction @xmath113 .",
    "the main purpose of our analysis will be in identification of new qualitative features of the pulsar radiation and comparing vacuum nonlinear corrections to the electromagnetic radiation with the other weak energy loose mechanisms .",
    "let s investigate the properties of the correction function @xmath114 .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that there is no radiation when the pulsar dipole moment is coaxial with the rotation axis i.e. when @xmath49 is zero .",
    "the correction function depends both on the angle @xmath49 and the angular velocity through @xmath115 , so the @xmath114 may be represented as a surface defined in the region where it s coordinates take values @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "some isolines  the relations @xmath118 at which this surface takes a constant value @xmath119 are represented at the fig.[contrfig ] , the numerical values for which were obtained with the @xmath120 and @xmath121 from the heisenberg - euler theory .",
    "the obtained isolines differ from each other by the absolute value of the correction function but all of them have pronounced extremum at some point which lies on the red line .",
    "this means that for each fixed angle @xmath49 between the pulsar dipole moment and rotation axis there is an angular velocity at which vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics corrections become the most pronounced .",
    "increasing @xmath122 at the constant @xmath49 up to the value marked by the red line increases correction of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "the subsequent @xmath122 and angular velocity increase becomes ineffective because the vacuum corrections in this case will be reduced .",
    "it should be noted , that increasing @xmath123 also will enhance total pulsar luminosity which is @xmath124 but at the same time , as it was mentioned , this will decrease vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics correction on the maxwell radiation background .",
    "for instance , if @xmath125 the correction will most significantly stand out for the pulsars with @xmath126 .",
    "so the correction function @xmath114 plays a role of a contrast . and the red line in fig.[contrfig ] marks the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath122 for the best contrast .",
    "another distinctive feature of the pulsar radiation is manifested in sophisticated , non - polynomial dependence between the radiation intensity ( [ i_total ] ) and the angular velocity , which greatly complicates the analysis . performing power - law approximation of ( [ i_total ] ) will allow us to describe vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence on the pulsar spin - down , in traditional terms of braking - indexes and torque - functions @xcite .",
    "it also provides a possibility for comparison of the pulsar spin - down caused by different non - electromagnetic dissipative factors and the power - low relation between the radiation intensity and angular velocity , for instance with the quadrupole gravitational radiation .",
    "let us investigate the features of the pulsar spin - down as a result of the radiation , with the amendments of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "the observed spin - down rate @xcite can be expressed by derivative of the angular velocity as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the pulsar s inertia momentum and the dot means the time derivative . for description in terms of torque functions , the right hand side of equation ( [ spd_initial ] ) should be represented in polynomial form of angular velocity @xmath129 where @xmath130 are decomposition coefficients and the number of the terms @xmath131 should be selected sufficient to ensure the required accuracy of the decomposition .",
    "we will take the number of terms in the expansion ( [ decomp ] ) equal to @xmath132 .",
    "this choice ensures the accuracy of power - law approximation for the pulsars with the @xmath133 better then 0.1% .",
    "it should be noted , that the series does not converge at @xmath134 but it s replacement by the partial sum with the specially selected number of terms allows to accomplish the polynomial approximation which provides a good match with the exact expression near @xmath135 , but leads to significant errors when @xmath136 . in this case",
    "the expansion coefficients ( with the @xmath120 and @xmath121 from the heisenberg - euler theory ) for the terms providing the largest contribution are represented in the table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the coefficients not listed in the table are small and can be neglected in further consideration .",
    "l|lllll @xmath49 & @xmath137 & @xmath138 & @xmath139 & @xmath140 & @xmath141 + @xmath142 & @xmath143 & @xmath144 & @xmath145 & @xmath146 & @xmath147 + @xmath148 & @xmath149 & @xmath150 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 & @xmath153 + @xmath154 & @xmath155 & @xmath156 & @xmath157 & @xmath158 & @xmath159 +    for quantitative analysis , we will take the inclination angle is equal to @xmath160 .",
    "this choice is justified because it provides the greatest total intensity of the pulsar radiation and in our comparison of nonlinear electrodynamics spin - down with the other non - electrodynamics dissipative factors , it gives the upper limit of nonlinear electrodynamics influence .",
    "after the expansion , the right hand side of the spin - down equation ( [ spd_initial ] ) will take the form : @xmath161 where @xmath162 corresponds to the torque function of the dipole magnetic radiation in maxwell electrodynamics @xcite : @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the torques originating form",
    "nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics : @xmath165    let us compare pulsar spin - down caused by nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics and dissipation caused by gravitational waves radiation . among several possible ways of gravitational radiation by an isolated pulsar we will choose two most relevant scenario  quadrupole mass radiation @xcite and the radiation caused by rossby waves @xcite , called r - modes",
    ".    quadrupole gravitational radiation can be originated by the strain caused by the pulsar rotation , which is especially likely for rapidly rotating pulsars .",
    "the spin - down under this kind of radiation can be represented as : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a gravitational constant and @xmath168 is the pulsar elipticity , which is in accordance with modern representations @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "another reason for gravitational waves emission by isolated pulsar are the oscillations modes induced by the pulsar rotation .",
    "gravitational radiation is caused by instability of such oscillations . as it was shown by owen et al .",
    "@xcite for young rapidly rotation pulsars spin - down caused by r - modes can be expressed in form : @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath45 are the pulsar mass and it s radius , the r - mode oscillations saturation amplitude @xmath172 was defined by @xcite , and dimensionless constant @xmath173 as it has been shown in @xcite is to be strictly bounded within @xmath174 .",
    "so the torque function for the quadrupole gravitational radiation @xmath175 can be compared with nonlinear electrodynamics torque @xmath176 and the r - modes radiation torque @xmath177 can be compared with the torque @xmath178 . for this comparison",
    "we suppose the pulsar with the typical radius @xmath179 , mass @xmath180 and inertia momentum @xmath181 . also we assume",
    ", that dipole moment inclination is @xmath160 and post - maxwellian parameters correspond to heisenberg - euler theory ( choice of born - infeld parameters in first estimation gives the similar order ) .",
    "for the pulsar with the surface magnetic field @xmath182 , which elipticity reaches the maximum value @xmath183 , r - mode saturation amplitude @xmath184 , and @xmath185 the following estimation takes place @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "so the quadrupole and r - mode gravitational radiation torque will significantly exceed nonlinear electrodynamics torque coupled with the terms @xmath188 and @xmath189 in spin - down equation .",
    "for another parameter set the opposite case takes place .",
    "if the pulsar distortion and elipticity is two orders of magnitude lower ( @xmath190 ) , and the pulsar field is stronger @xmath191 then @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the rapidly rotating pulsars with such a strong field have not been observed yet . nevertheless , the theoretical models assuming the blitzars as the sources of fast radio burst @xcite do not eliminate the possibility of such a strong electromagnetic fields for the rapidly rotating pulsar . therefore obtained ratio between the torques seems very exotic but",
    "still can not be completely discarded .",
    "in this work , we have studied vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence on rapidly rotating pulsar radiation in parameterized post - maxwellian electrodynamics . in assumption of flat space - time the analytical description of radiation intensity ( [ i_total ] )",
    "was obtained . despite on the fact that the expression for the intensity is quite complicating for analysis some new features of pulsar s radiation have been obtained .",
    "for instance , it was shown that for the rapidly rotating pulsar vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics corrections observation is optimal only for certain relations between the inclination angle @xmath49 of the magnetic dipole moment to the rotation axis and the angular velocity @xmath46 .",
    "such relation plays a role of the contrast for nonlinear corrections on total pulsar radiation background .",
    "it follows that enhancing of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics influence on pulsar radiation requires not only increasing magnetic field but also needs compliance of conditions marked on fig.[contrfig ] to ensure the best possible contrast for the nonlinear corrections .",
    "the obtained radiation intensity was used to estimate pulsar spin - down . in this framework , for description in terms of the torque functions the power - low expansion of the intensity ( [ i_total ] )",
    "was carried out ( [ spd_torque])-([kn ] ) with the decomposition coefficients listed in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "this provided an opportunity to compare nonlinear electrodynamics torque with the the weak mechanisms of the energy dissipation , for instance with gravitational waves radiation . for such comparison",
    "the most realistic scenarios of gravitational radiation by isolated pulsar were selected ",
    "quadrupole gravitational radiation and r - modes radiation .",
    "the quantitative comparison has shown that for the common rapidly rotating pulsar , gravitational radiation torques significantly exceed nonlinear electrodynamics torques coupled with the terms of same @xmath46 powers in spin - down equation .",
    "this result can be explained by low surface magnetic field @xmath194 specific for most of rapidly rotating pulsar s population .",
    "implementation of similar estimates for the compact object possessing stronger magnetic field ( hypothetical blitzar ) @xmath195 shows the possibility of the opposite case when vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics torques exceed gravitational torque and play more significant role in spin - down equation under certain conditions .",
