    "stellar modeling , and in particular helio- and asteroseismology , require an equation of state and corresponding thermodynamic quantities that are smooth , consistent , valid over a large range of temperatures and densities , and that incorporate the most important chemical elements of astrophysical relevance ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in astrophysics ,",
    "the equation of state plays two basic roles . on the one hand",
    ", it supplies the thermodynamic properties necessary for describing gaseous objects such as stars and gas - planets . on the other hand it also provides the ionization equilibria and level populations , which can be used as the foundation for opacity calculations .",
    "thanks to helioseismology , the sun has broadened this perspective .",
    "the remarkable precision by which we have now peered into the sun , puts strong demands on any physics going into a solar model .",
    "this , to such a degree , that we can turn around the argument and use the sun as an astrophysical laboratory to study coulomb systems under conditions not yet achieved on earth .",
    "although the solar plasma is only moderately non - ideal , the tight observational constraints prompts the use of methods normally reserved for studies of more strongly - coupled plasmas . in this way",
    "the solar experiment addresses a much broader range of plasmas , _",
    "e.g. _ , jovian planets , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars , as well as white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the two equation - of - state efforts we compare in this paper are associated with the two leading opacity calculations of the eighties and nineties .",
    "the mhd eos @xcite was developed for the international _ opacity project _",
    "( op ) described and summarized in the two volumes by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the opal eos is the equation of state underlying the opal opacity project at livermore ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "another highly successful eos address the extreme conditions in low - mass stars and giant planets and include the transition to the fluid phase @xcite . in a trade - off between accuracy and range of validity , this eos has so far only been computed for h / he - mixtures , rendering it less suitable for verification by helioseismic inversions .",
    "the equations of state by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and @xcite employ analytical fits to a great range of non - ideal effects resulting in accurate , flexible and fast equation of state calculations .",
    "the drawback of both attempts are their assumptions of complete ionization , again making it hard to verify them by helioseismic inversions .",
    "comparisons with these and other eos should , however , be an essential part of efforts to further develop precise stellar eos .",
    "the op and opal projects are based on two rather different philosophies ; the _ chemical picture _ and the _ physical picture _ ,",
    "respectively , as detailed in sect .",
    "[ chemeos ] and [ physeos ] .",

    "detailed comparisons between the mhd and opal eos have proved very useful for discovering the importance and consequences of several physical effects @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ eosscape ] , we extend these comparisons to a systematic search in the entire @xmath2@xmath3 plane , and in sect .",
    "[ eossun ] we take a closer look at the eos under solar circumstances .",
    "the consensus of the last few years has been that in helioseismic comparisons the opal eos is closer to the sun than the mhd eos @xcite although both are remarkably better than earlier theories .",
    "however , recent helioseismic inversions for the adiabatic exponent @xmath4 @xcite indicates that the mhd eos fares better than opal in the upper 3% of the sun including the ionization zones of hydrogen and helium .",
    "recently the previously converging solar abundances @xcite , have been upset by new abundance analysis @xcite performed on 3d simulations of convection in the solar surface layers .",
    "this approach avoids the free - parameters necessary in conventional abundance analysis employing 1d atmosphere models .",
    "the result is a lower solar heavy element abundance causing severe disagreements with helioseismic observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the consequences for equation of state issues and helioseismic measurements are further discussed in sect .",
    "[ ags05review ] .",
    "these new developments again highlights the importance of competing equation - of - state efforts and systematic comparisons such as the present .",
    "the simplest model of a plasma is a non - ionizing mixture of nuclei and electrons , obeying the classical _ perfect gas _ law . however , an _ ideal gas _ can be more general than a perfect gas .",
    "ideal only refers to the interactions between particles in the gas .",
    "the interactions in any gas redistribute energy and momentum between the particles , giving rise to statistical equilibrium . in an ideal gas",
    "these interactions do not contribute to the energy of the gas , implying that they are point interactions .",
    "since the coulomb potential is long - range in nature , and not a @xmath5-function , real plasmas can not be ideal .",
    "deviations from the perfect gas law , such as ionization , internal degrees of freedom ( _ i.e. _ , excited states ) , radiation and fermi - dirac statistics of electrons are all in the ideal regime . and the particles forming",
    "the gas can be classical or quantum , material or photonic ; as long as their interactions have infinitessimal range , the gas is still ideal .",
    "all such ideal effects can be calculated as exactly as desired .    the ideal picture , is however , not adequate even for the solar case . at the solar center ,",
    "an ideal - gas calculation leaves about 25% of the gas un - ionized .",
    "on the other hand , the mere size of the neutral ( unperturbed ) atoms , do not permit more than 7% of the hydrogen to be unionized at these densities , provided the atoms stay in the ground state and are closely packed .",
    "at the temperature at the center of the sun neither of these assumptions can possibly hold and the mere introduction of _ size _ and _ packed _ immediately imply interactions between the constituents of the plasma and it is therefore no longer ideal .    in a plasma of charges , @xmath6 , with average inter - particle distance @xmath7 , we define the coupling parameter , @xmath8 , as the ratio of average potential binding energy over mean kinetic energy @xmath9 @xmath10 plasmas with @xmath11 are _ strongly _ coupled , _ e.g. _ the interior of white dwarfs , where coupling can become so strong as to force crystallization .",
    "those with @xmath12 are _ weakly _ coupled , as in stars more massive than slightly sub - solar .",
    "as one can suspect , @xmath8 is the dimensionless coupling parameter according to which one can classify theories .",
    "weakly - coupled plasmas lend to systematic perturbative ideas ( _ e.g. _ in powers of @xmath8 ) , strongly coupled plasma need more creative treatments .",
    "improvements in the equation of state beyond the model of a mixture of ideal gases are difficult , both for conceptual and technical reasons .",
    "the new treatise on stellar structure and evolution by @xcite contains a comprehensive presentation of the current state of the equation of state .",
    "the present comparison is not merely between two eos - projects , but also between two fundamentally different approaches to the problem .",
    "the _ chemical picture _ is named for its foundation in the notion of a chemical equilibrium between a set of pre - defined molecules , atoms and ions .    in the _ physical picture _ only the `` elementary '' particles of the problem",
    "are assumed from the outset  that is , nuclei and electrons .",
    "composite particles appear from the formulation .",
    "most realistic equations of state that have appeared in the last 30 years belong to the chemical picture and are based on the free - energy minimization method .",
    "this method uses approximate statistical mechanical models ( for example the non - relativistic electron gas , debye - hckel theory for ionic species , hard - core atoms to simulate pressure ionization via configurational terms , quantum mechanical models of atoms in perturbed fields , _ etc . _ ) . from these models",
    "a macroscopic free energy is constructed as a function of temperature @xmath2 , volume @xmath13 , and the particle numbers @xmath14 of the @xmath15 molecules , atoms and ions ( and delectrons ) included in the plasma model . at given @xmath2 and @xmath13 ,",
    "this free energy is minimized subject to the stoichiometric constraints connecting the various particle species through ionizations and dissociations .",
    "the solution of this minimum problem then gives both the equilibrium concentrations and , if inserted in the free energy and its derivatives , the equation of state and the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "obviously , this procedure automatically guarantees thermodynamic consistency , through the fulfillment of the maxwell relations . as an example , when the coulomb pressure correction ( see sect .",
    "[ coulomb - corr ] ) to the ideal - gas contribution originates from the free energy ( and not merely as a correction to the pressure ) , there will be corresponding terms in all the other thermodynamic variables , as well as changes to the equilibrium concentrations .",
    "this is not properly appreciated in some of the equations of state used for modern stellar atmosphere models ( all in the chemical picture ) , and the values of thermodynamic derivatives will therefore depend on how they are evaluated .",
    "this affects the value of the adiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath16 , and hence the boundaries of convection zones . in the physical picture , outlined below",
    ", thermodynamic consistency is ensured in a similar way ; by modeling a thermodynamic potential and evaluating all thermodynamic quantities and derivatives from the maxwell relations",
    ". one major advantage of using the chemical picture lies in the possibility to model complicated plasmas , and to obtain numerically smooth thermodynamical quantities .    in the chemical picture ,",
    "perturbed atoms must be introduced on a more - or - less _ ad - hoc _ basis to avoid the familiar divergence of internal partition functions ( see _ e.g. _   * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the approximation of unperturbed atoms precludes the application of standard statistical mechanics , _",
    "i.e. _ the attribution of a boltzmann - factor to each atomic state .",
    "the conventional remedy is to modify the atomic states , _",
    "e.g. _ by cutting off the highly excited states in function of density and temperature .",
    "the mhd equation - of - state is based on an occupation probability formalism @xcite , where the internal partition functions @xmath17 of species @xmath18 are weighted sums @xmath19 here , @xmath20 label state @xmath21 of species @xmath18 , and @xmath22 is the energy and @xmath23 the statistical weight of that state .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 are the occupation probabilities that take into account charged and neutral surrounding particles . in physical terms , @xmath24 gives the fraction of all particles of species @xmath18 that can exist in state @xmath21 with an electron bound to the atom or ion , and @xmath25 gives the fraction of those that are so heavily perturbed by nearby neighbors that their states are effectively destroyed .",
    "perturbations by neutral particles are based on an excluded - volume treatment and perturbations by charges are calculated from a fit to a quantum - mechanical stark - ionization theory ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the opacity project and , with it , the mhd equation - of - state restricts itself to the case of stellar envelopes , where density is sufficiently low that the concept of atoms makes sense .",
    "this was the main justification for realizing the opacity - project in the chemical picture and basing it on the mihalas , hummer , dppen equation of state ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter mhd ) .",
    "the opacity project is mainly an effort to compute accurate atomic data , and to use these in opacity calculations .",
    "plasma effects on occupation numbers are of secondary interest .",
    "the chemical pictures heuristic separation of the atomic - physics from the statistical mechanics is avoided in the physical picture .",
    "it starts out from the grand canonical ensemble of a system of electrons and nuclei interacting through the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "bound clusters of nuclei and electrons , corresponding to ions , atoms and molecules are sampled in this ensemble .",
    "any effects of the plasma environment on the internal states are obtained directly from the statistical mechanical analysis , rather than by assertion as in the chemical picture .",
    "there is an impressive body of literature on the physical picture .",
    "important sources of information with many references are the books by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of work on the physical picture was not dedicated to the problem of obtaining a high - precision equation of state for stellar interiors .",
    "such an attempt was made for the first time by the opal - team at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and used as a foundation for the opal opacities @xcite .",
    "the opal approach avoids the _ ad - hoc _ cutoff procedures necessary in free energy minimization schemes .",
    "the method also provides a systematic procedure for including plasma effects in the photon absorption coefficients .",
    "an effective potential method is used to generate atomic data which have an accuracy similar to single configuration hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the chemical picture , plagued by divergent partition functions , the physical picture has the power to avoid them altogether .",
    "partition functions of bound clusters of particles ( _ e.g. _ atoms and ions ) are divergent in the saha approach , but has a compensating divergent scattering state part in the physical picture @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of the physical picture is that it incorporates this compensation at the outset .",
    "a further advantage is that no assumptions about energy - level shifts have to be made ; it follows from the formalism that there are none .    as a result ,",
    "the boltzmann sum appearing in the atomic ( ionic ) free energy is replaced by the so - called planck - larkin partition function ( plpf ) , given by @xcite @xmath26 \\ .\\ ] ] the plpf is convergent without additional cut - off criteria as are required in the chemical picture .",
    "we stress , however , that despite its name the plpf is not a partition function , but merely an auxiliary term in a virial coefficient ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "the major disadvantage of the physical picture , is its formulation in terms of density- or activity - expansions .",
    "expansions that first of all are very cumbersome to carry out , which means that so far only terms up to @xmath27 in density have been evaluated @xcite .",
    "second , the slow convergence of the problem , means that even this extraordinary accomplishment has a rather limited range of validity . the chemical picture ,",
    "on the other hand , do not need to rely on expansions , and complicated expressions , possibly with the correct asymptotic behavior , can be used freely .",
    "the coulomb correction , that is , the consequence of an overall attractive binding force of a neutral plasma deserves close attention , because it describes the main truly non - ideal effect under conditions as found in the interior of normal stars . already in a number of early papers @xcite",
    "it was suggested that improvements in the equation of state , especially the inclusion of a coulomb correction , could reduce discrepancies between computed and observed @xmath28-modes in the sun .",
    "responding to this , @xcite , showed that the mhd equation of state indeed improved the agreement with helioseismology . that the largest change was caused by the coulomb correction was not immediately clear , since the mhd equation of state also incorporates other improvements over previous work .    from early comparisons between the mhd and opal equations of state @xcite , it turned out , rather surprisingly , that the net effect of the other major improvement , the influence of hydrogen and helium bound states on thermodynamic quantities , became to a large degree eclipsed beneath the influence of the coulomb - term . in the solar hydrogen and helium ionization zones",
    "the coulomb - term is the dominant correction to the ionizing perfect gas . this discovery led to an upgrade of the simple , but astrophysically useful @xcite ( eff ) equation of state through the inclusion of the coulomb interaction term ( ceff ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the leading - order coulomb correction is given by the debye - hckel ( dh ) theory , which replaces the long - range coulomb potential with a screened potential , as outlined below .",
    "the @xcite theory of electrolytes , describes polarization in liquid solutions of electrons and positive ions .",
    "this description also applies to ionizing gases .",
    "assuming the particles can move freely , the electrons will congregate around the ions , and the ions will repel each other due to their charges . with their smaller mass and higher speeds ,",
    "the paths of electrons are deflected by the ions increasing the chance of finding an electron closer to an ion .",
    "this screening by the electrons decreases the repulsion between the ions , acting as an overall attractive force in the plasma .",
    "the fundamental assumption of debye and hckel is that of statistical equilibrium , according to which the local density of particles of type @xmath29 ( including electrons ) immersed in a potential @xmath30 around an ion , @xmath21 , can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the charge and mean density of the particles and @xmath34 are the perturbed densities .",
    "@xmath35 is the plasma - potential or the effective ( screened ) inter - particle potential . over - all charge neutrality",

    "the most critical of debye s approximations is to retain only terms up to first order .",
    "the zero - order term is the net - charge , eq .",
    "( [ no - net - charge ] ) . solving eq .",
    "( [ pois : boltz ] ) with the remaining first - order terms results in a screened coulomb potential  the _ debye - hckel potential _ @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the debye - length @xmath41 the approximation of disregarding higher order terms affects the low temperature and high density region where the inter - particle interactions becomes too large to be described by just the first order term .",
    "this is a manifestation of the problems with the classical , long - range part of the coulomb field in a plasma .",
    "investigations taking the physical picture point of view indicate that the original potential defined in ( [ pois : boltz ] ) , is a good choice for a plasma potential @xcite , and only the truncation of the exponential resulting in the debye - hckel potential is of limited validity @xcite    at high densities the effect is in fact overestimated by using the debye - hckel potential ( [ debye_pot ] ) .",
    "the relative coulomb pressure in the debye - hckel theory , expressed in terms of the coupling parameter , @xmath42 , is a negative contribution to the pressure . at very high densities",
    ", the over - estimation of the coulomb pressure can be so severe as to result in a negative total pressure .",
    "the negative pressure differences seen in the comparison plots in sects.[eosscape ] and [ eossun ] , suggests that the amplitude of the coulomb pressure is larger in opal than in mhd .",
    "this statement is true when the @xmath1-correction , mentioned below , is applied to the mhd eos .    to get a feeling for the behavior of the coulomb pressure",
    ", we use the perfect gas law to obtain the approximate expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mean - molecular weight .",
    "this leads us to anticipate differences between opal and mhd , stemming from different treatments of the plasma interactions , to increase with @xmath45 , and that such differences will be somewhat reduced when we mix in helium and metals .      as they were investigating electrolytic solutions of molecules under terrestrial conditions , it was natural for debye and hckel to consider electrolytes made up of hard spheres .",
    "assuming there is a _ distance of closest approach _ , @xmath46 to the ion , eq .",
    "( [ debye_pot ] ) is modified to @xmath47 for @xmath48 and constant , @xmath49 , inside , removing the short range divergence . to obtain the free energy ,",

    "the @xmath1-factor goes from one to zero as @xmath52 increase , reducing the coulomb pressure which was overestimated before . with the @xmath1 correction",
    "we can avoid the negative pressures mentioned above .",
    "@xcite proposed to use @xmath53^{-1}\\ , \\ ] ] for stellar plasmas , and it was later used in the mhd eos but not in opal .",
    "this choice of @xmath46 is merely the distance of equipartition between thermal and potential energy of electrons approaching ions . since the charges are opposite there are , however , no classical limits to their approach .",
    "also notice that since this choice of @xmath46 depends explicitly on charge , the recharging procedure will result in a different form of @xmath1 .",
    "a thorough and critical review of the debye - hckel theory can be found in @xcite , chp .",
    "ix , and a very clear presentation is found in @xcite , though the latter does not mention @xmath1 .      obviously , the @xmath1 correction is just one particular higher - order coulomb correction .",
    "we can use it as a model for developing more general expressions , by allowing some liberty in the choice of @xmath46 .",
    "let us begin by asking about the distance of closest approach for quantum - mechanical electrons .",
    "heisenberg s uncertainty relation puts firm limits on how localized particle can be  it is smeared out over a volume the size of a de broglie wavelength @xmath54 .",
    "this de - localization eliminates the infinite charge densities associated with classical point - particles , and hence the short - range divergence of the coulomb potential .",
    "based on that , we can tentatively suggest a distance of closest approach which is the combined radii of the electron and ion : @xmath55 .",
    "the diffraction parameter , @xmath56 , between two particles @xmath21 and @xmath29 , emerging from a more careful quantum - mechanical analysis implies the use of the de broglie wavelength in relative coordinates @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the reduced mass .",
    "comparing the @xmath1-function with the quantum diffraction modification in fig .  5 of @xcite , we see a similarity in the functional form .",
    "the asymptotic behavior differs though : @xmath59 for @xmath60 in the hard - sphere model , whereas quantum diffraction goes as @xmath61 .",
    "the two functions are very close up to @xmath62 , though , suggesting that preliminary investigations of quantum diffraction effects in the mhd eos could be carried out by means of the @xmath1-function and a new @xmath46 as given by eq .",
    "( [ rmin - diff ] ) .    dividing eq .",
    "( [ rmin - diff ] ) by @xmath40 , we find that the correction is now a function of @xmath63 only . that is , going from a hard - sphere model of interactions , to including quantum diffraction , the factor alleviating the short - range divergence of the coulomb potential becomes a function of @xmath63 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "abandoning the hard - sphere ion correction for the benefit of quantum diffraction , still leaves us with only the first term of the coulomb interactions .",
    "could the higher order terms be represented by @xmath1 in some form ?",
    "it turns out that @xmath1 would only fit in a very limited range , and it would be more fruitful to use proper expressions .",
    "the present analysis however , shows that the effect of including higher - order coulomb terms , is smaller than has previously been estimated by the mhd eos .",
    "it therefore might be a better approximation to leave them out for at least the solar case . as shown in fig .",
    "13 of @xcite , the coupling parameter attains appreciable values in the outer layers of the sun and higher - order coulomb terms will most likely cause better agreement with helioseismology .",
    "for this comparison , we have computed mhd eos tables with exactly the same @xmath64-grid points as the opal - tables @xcite , to ensure that the equation - of - state comparison is not influenced by interpolation errors .",

    "finally , at log@xmath132 , we find a broad dip supplied by the two uppermost ionization stages of c , n , o and ne , having ionization energies in the range between 400ev and 1360ev .",
    "the only quantity in which the introduction of heavy elements is manifested directly is @xmath70 , which is an important key variable in helioseismology ( since it is closely related to adiabatic sound speed @xmath133 ) .",
    "the promise of these features is that the presence of heavy elements is well marked in @xmath70 . actually , this marking is so distinct @xcite , that in future solar and stellar applications of the mhd and opal equations of state it might be worth to include more heavy elements the influence due to our small quantity of heavy elements is about three times larger than the difference between opal and mhd , though we hasten to add that our heavy element abundance of @xmath134 is chosen too high in order to exhibit the effects more clearly ; they would of course decrease with a more solar metallicity around @xmath135@xmath136% .    we have not discussed radiation pressure yet , merely because of the lack of controversy about it . however , it is worth a few notes .",
    "the ratio between radiation pressure and gas pressure is constant along iso-@xmath45 lines the two being equal around log@xmath137 .",
    "the largest radiation effects therefore occur at log@xmath96 where there is also the smallest discrepancy between opal and mhd .",
    "the effect of radiation changes log@xmath89 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath70 by @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "a closer inspection of the derivatives in the perfect gas region reveals some discrepancies which are likely due to the numerical differentiation performed in the opal eos .",
    "this is most noticeable in @xmath70 , where the opal - mhd differences in the perfect gas region are as large as 0.03% , which admittedly is small indeed .",
    "helioseismology will , however , soon be dealing with such precision .",
    "this difference most probably comes from problems in the numerical calculation of an adiabatic change as performed in opal ( note that mhd uses essentially analytical expressions for @xmath70 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 since an adiabatic change is not rectangular in the @xmath139 plane , such an interpretation is consistent with the fact that the differences in the derivatives with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath2 ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ) are about one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this also means , that in the ionization zones where pressure and entropy are non - linear functions of @xmath63 and @xmath2 , this differentiation noise must be much larger . on the other hand ,",
    "the differences between opal and mhd are still at least an order of magnitude larger than this differentiation noise .",
    "we hope , however , that future improvements will make opal and mhd converge to within that level of the actual eos , requiring higher numerical standards .",
    "the differences in @xmath81 and @xmath82 have a tendency to follow iso-@xmath45 tracks , while the differences in @xmath70 follow isotherms .",
    "these two behaviors are still unexplained . in fig .",
    "[ gamma1 ] , the differences following isotherms are pretty clear , but the iso-@xmath45 differences are also visible , well below the rising mountain at high @xmath45-values .",
    "recently the previously converging solar abundances @xcite , have been upset by new abundance analysis by @xcite ( and references therein ) performed on 3d radiation - coupled hydrodynamical simulations of convection in the solar surface layers ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "this approach completely avoids the concepts of micro- and macro - turbulence of 1d models , as the line - broadening velocity - fields are included explicitly .",
    "this results in synthetic spectral lines that not only have the widths of the observed lines , but also match the detailed ( asymmetric ) shapes of the lines @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of free parameters to essentially the abundances we seek , and gives less ambiguous abundances .",
    "the result is a general lowering of the solar heavy element abundances @xcite and most notably a halving of the oxygen abundance .",
    "this has a severe impact on the previously close agreement between solar models and helioseismic observations ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the lowering @xmath6 to about 1.1% , decreases the opacity at the bottom of the convection zone thereby decreasing the depth of the convection zone @xcite at odds with helioseismic measurements @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sunh - ne ] we touched upon the determination of the helium abundance by helioseismically measuring the bump in @xmath70 around @xmath140 .",
    "this bump also has a contribution from oxygen , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gam1_xcmp ] , and a lowering of the oxygen abundance will therefore have an effect on the solar helium abundance . to keep the agreement with the helioseismic helium abundance determination , a smaller @xmath6 has to be accompanied by a an increase in @xmath130 .",
    "we have interpolated the @xmath70-differences of mix  2 and 3 with respect to mix  1 , to find the amplitude of the feature around @xmath141 . from this",
    "we find that a change of @xmath6 from 1.8% to 1.1% should be accompanied by an increase of @xmath130 by 0.0039 ( using mhd ) in order to keep the bump unchanged .",
    "* @xcite perform a helio - seismic determination of the solar helium abundance using the new and lower @xmath6 , but based on the updated opal eos @xcite .",
    "they use a slightly higher @xmath142% for the new abundances and find an increase in @xmath130 of 0.0050 . to translate to our choices of @xmath6",
    "we derive a @xmath143 from their results , which gives a @xmath130-increase of 0.0072 .",
    "this means that the @xmath70 of the opal eos is about 1.8 times more sensitive to the heavy element content , than the mhd eos is . * evolutionary models with the two sets of abundances , calibrated to the present solar radius and luminosity ,",
    "on the other hand , result in a _ decrease _ of @xmath130 by 0.005 @xcite  a total discrepancy between models and helioseismology of about 0.0089 , accompanied by large discrepancies in the depth of the convection zone and sound speed and density profiles . for comparison , the helioseismic method for measuring the amplitude of the he - bump ,",
    "has an uncertainty of only 0.001 - 0.002 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here , that @xcite find that inversions using the mhd equation of state results in @xmath130 being about 0.004 higher than when using opal .",
    "* this is most likely a consequence of our finding above , that the heavy elements make a larger contribution to @xmath70 in the opal eos , resulting in a lower helium abundance compared to the same analysis based on the mhd eos . *",
    "the difference between opal and mhd in this region , although at a maximum here , is therefore too small to solve the problem .",
    "this is , however , also a region of the sun with rather extreme plasma conditions , as measured by the coupling parameter ( see eq .",
    "[ [ gamma ] ] ) making this a likely site for further improvements to the equation of state .",
    "@xcite performed a very interesting analysis of response of the intrinsic @xmath70 to a range of abundance changes , and the ability of helioseismology to pick - up these changes .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath70 differences between a model and the sun , are the differences between @xmath70s reduced to the same temperature and density stratification , _",
    "i.e. _ , subtracting the effects of different stratifications and finding the intrinsic differences @xcite , as caused by equation of state differences or abundance differences , and therefore directly comparable to our figs .",
    "[ solar_h8 ] , [ solar_hhe8 ] and [ solar_h - ne8 ] .",
    "@xcite find that a change in @xmath130 of 0.01 for fixed @xmath67 , results in changes in @xmath70 of similar magnitude as we see between mhd and opal in the present work .",
    "furthermore , a decrease in the carbon abundance actually improves the agreement between the sun and models below @xmath144 .",
    "both effects are visible in helioseismic inversions of the models .",
    "bear in mind that these abundance changes are accompanied by changes to the sound speed and density too , and we are therefore still far from a reconciliation between the new abundance determinations and the helioseismic inversions .",
    "an examination of the new opacities from the opacity project @xcite shows that the sensitivity to changes in the helium abundance is minimal in the region around the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the change in helium opacity is compensated by a similar , but opposite change in the hydrogen and heavy element opacities , and the depth of the convection zone will therefore be unaffected by a small increase of the helium content .",
    "the present comparison of the two mhd and opal eos has revealed the reasons of several differences between these equations of state .",
    "they can be summarized as follows ( in order of importance ) :      we find the largest differences at high densities and low temperatures , or more precisely , at high @xmath45-values . from sect .",
    "[ dhapprox ] and eq .",
    "( [ lambda - approx ] ) we know that this property is indicative of differences in the treatment of plasma interactions . comparing the peaks of the differences in _",
    "e.g. _ pressure ( see figs .",
    "[ solar_h1 ] , [ solar_hhe1 ] and  [ solar_h - ne1 ] ) , we obtain mix  1-to - mix  2 ratios of 0.797 , and mix  1-to - mix  3 ratios of 0.788 , which agrees very well with eq .",
    "( [ lambda - approx ] ) , and thus further substantiates our interpretation .",
    "these differences are lowered dramatically when we set @xmath113 in mhd , indicating that it is worthwhile to abolish @xmath1 and reconsider how to get rid of the short - range divergence in the plasma - potential ( see sect .",
    "[ higherorder ] ) .    in the high - temperature - high - density corner of the tables",
    "we observe how degeneracy sets in . along with degeneracy",
    ", we also notice how some specific differences are growing",
    ". this effect could be due to quantum diffraction or exchange effects , both included in opal but not in mhd .",
    "quantum diffraction is the effect of the quantum mechanical smearing out of , primarily , the electron due to its wave nature .",
    "the exchange effect is a modification of the quantum diffraction arising from the anti - symmetric nature of two - particle wavefunctions of fermions .    differences also appear in the ionization zones , and a great deal of them can be attributed to the @xmath1 correction , but not all of it .",
    "the causes for the rest of these differences are not easily identified .",
    "they might be due to the basic differences between the physical- and the chemical approach to the plasma .",
    "the treatment of bound state energies and wave functions might have an effect in this region .",
    "these are highly accurate in mhd but calculated in the isolated particle approximation , whereas they are approximate ( fitted to ground - state energies ) , but varying with the plasma environment in opal .",
    "we have also tried experimenting with the assumed critical field strength used in mhd for the disruption of a bound state [ eq .",
    "( 4.24 ) of @xcite ] .",
    "however , this intervention had only a very small effect .",
    "earlier investigations by @xcite indicated that a change in the micro - field distribution might have a greater effect , and that highly excited states are more populated in the opal eos , although the opal eos ionizes the plasma more readily than mhd @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of thermodynamic differentials is done numerically in opal but analytically in mhd . for the quantities",
    "we have examined here , the difference becomes most apparent in @xmath70 . in the trivial perfect gas region of the @xmath0 plane , opal",
    "is rugged on a 0.03% scale ( see sect .  [ diff ] ) , as opposed to the smooth mhd .",
    "these 0.03% may sound negligible , but helioseismology is approaching that level . in ionization zones ,",
    "the discrepancies due to differentiation are most likely larger . on the other hand ,",
    "physical differences between the two eos are still at least an order of magnitude larger .",
    "new solar abundance analysis performed on 3d convection simulations by @xcite lowers the metallicity and almost halves the oxygen abundance ( the most abundant heavy element in the sun ) , with detrimental effects on the agreement with helioseismology . since the helium abundance is found from helioseismic measurements of the bump in @xmath70 from the second helium ionization , and since this feature is blended with the third ionization of oxygen , a reduction in oxygen should be accompanied by an increase in helium .",
    "specifically we find that an 0.45% increase of @xmath130 is necessary to keep the bump unchanged with respect to the proposed change of oxygen .",
    "this is of the same magnitude , but opposite the change in @xmath130 required for a solar evolution model to fit the current radius and luminosity of the sun @xcite .    for helioseismic studies of the equation of state",
    "it is a fortunate property of the sun that high-@xmath45 conditions are found exclusively in the convection zone , where the stratification is essentially adiabatic , and therefore virtually decoupled from radiation and the uncertainty in the opacity @xcite . as opacity calculations are still subject to errors of 5 - 10% , we stress the importance of the fact that opacity effects do not contaminate the structure of the convection zone .",
    "this means that the solar convection zone is a perfect laboratory for investigations of the most controversial parts of the eos .",
    "the difference between @xmath70 from and eos and that of the sun can be inferred from helioseismology , and that with an accuracy that by far exceeds the discrepancy between the two of the best present eos for stellar structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the pursuit for a better eos is therefore not at all academic , and we can improve both solar models and atomic physics in the process @xcite .",
