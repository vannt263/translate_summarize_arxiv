    "quantum gravity ( qg ) strongly indicates the finite resolution of space - time , that is , space - time uncertainty .",
    "a glance at a recent qg literature obviously shows that space - time uncertainty is common for all approaches to quantum gravity : space - time uncertainty relations in string theory @xcite ; noncommutative space - time approach @xcite ; loop quantum gravity @xcite ; or space - time uncertainty relations coming from a simple gedankenexperiments of space - time measurement @xcite .",
    "well known entropy bounds emerging via the merging of quantum theory and general relativity also imply finite space - time resolution @xcite .",
    "the combination of quantum theory and general relativity in one or another way manifests that the conventional notion of distance breaks down the latest at the planck scale @xmath0 cm @xcite . since our understanding of time",
    "is tightly related to the periodic motion along some length scale , this result implies in general an impossibility of space - time distance measurement to a better accuracy than @xmath1 .",
    "it is tantamount to say that the space - time point undergoes fluctuations of the order of @xmath2 , that is , space - time point is effectively replaced by the cell @xmath3 , we refer the reader to a very readable papers of alden mead @xcite for his discussion regarding the status of a fundamental ( minimum ) length @xmath4 , as this conceptual standpoint was unanimous in almost all subsequent papers albeit many authors apparently did not know that paper . the local fluctuations , @xmath5 , add up over the macroscopic scale @xmath6 in this or another way that results in fluctuation @xmath7 .",
    "in view of the fact how the local fluctuations of space - time add up over the macroscopic scale different scenarios come into play .",
    "most interesting in quantum gravity are random and holographic fluctuations .",
    "if the local fluctuations , @xmath1 , are of random nature then over the length scale @xmath8 they add up as @xmath9 @xcite . in the holographic case",
    ", the local fluctuations , @xmath1 , add up over the length scale @xmath8 in such a way to ensure the black hole entropy bound on the horizon region @xmath10 @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will consider a relatively general case by parameterizing the space - time uncertainty as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is understood to be of order unity .",
    "eq.([lenunc ] ) tells us that because of background metric fluctuations the length @xmath8 undergoes fluctuations of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "having summarized the background metric fluctuations in eq.([lenunc ] ) , let us concisely formulate the problem we want to address in this paper .",
    "metric fluctuations naturally produce the fluctuations in energy - momentum of particle , for the particle with momentum @xmath15 has the wavelength @xmath16 and due to length fluctuation , eq.([lenunc ] ) , one finds @xmath17 . an interesting idea for detecting the space - time fluctuations",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider a phase incoherence of light coming to us from extragalactic sources .",
    "the energy - momentum uncertainties result in uncertainties of phase and group velocities of the photon leading to the phase incoherence of photon during the propagation .",
    "since the phase coherence of light from an astronomical source incident upon a two - element interferometer is necessary condition to subsequently form interference fringes , such observations offer by far the most sensitive and uncontroversial test .",
    "the interference pattern when the source is viewed through a telescope will be destroyed if the phase incoherence , @xmath18 , approaches @xmath19 . in other words , if the light with wavelength @xmath20 received from a celestial optical source located at a distance @xmath8 away produces the normal interference pattern , the corresponding phase uncertainty should satisfy the condition @xmath21 . soon after the appearance of paper @xcite it was noticed in @xcite that such a naive approach overestimates the effect as the authors of @xcite do not take into account the fact that the light coming from the distant stellar objects is incoherent from the beginning but acquires a mutual coherence later simply by propagation of rays over a large distance with respect to the van cittert - zernike theorem @xcite . in order to estimate the correct size of the effect ,",
    "let us follow a textbook @xcite , which gives the basics concerning the stellar interferometry .",
    "light from a real physical source is never strictly monochromatic but rather quasi - monochromatic , even the sharpest spectral line has a finite width . in a monochromatic wave",
    "the amplitude at any point @xmath22 is constant , while the phase varies linearly with time , that is , a general monochromatic wave of frequency @xmath23 can be represented as a solution of the wave equation of the form @xmath24 } ~.\\ ] ] this is no longer the case in a wave produced by a real source : the amplitude and phase undergo irregular fluctuations , the rapidity of which depends on the width of spectrum @xmath25 ,    @xmath26 } ~,\\ ] ]    where the amplitudes @xmath27 differ appreciably from zero only within a narrow range around a mean frequency @xmath28 @xmath29 such a quasi - monochromatic wave which is usually referred to as a wave packet in the physics literature is characterized with a group and phase velocities @xmath30     illuminated by an extended quasi - monochromatic incoherent source @xmath31 . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    if @xmath25 is sufficiently small the wave packet eq.([wpacket ] ) can be interpreted as a plane wave with frequency @xmath28 , wave number @xmath32 and variable amplitude    @xmath33 \\,r-\\left[\\omega - \\bar{\\omega}\\right ]      t\\right\\}}~.\\ ] ] the width @xmath25 determines duration of the wave packet @xmath34 , an important characteristic for the interference effect .",
    "namely , the interference effect to take place the path difference between the overlapping quasi - monochromatic beams must be less than the coherence length @xmath35 .",
    "now let us follow van cittert - zernike approach to the mutual coherence of light from an extended quasi - monochromatic source . a screen @xmath36 is illuminated by an extended quasi - monochromatic incoherent source @xmath31 taken for simplicity to be a portion of a plane parallel to @xmath36 , see fig.1 .",
    "the points @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspond to the slits of interferometer .",
    "we will make the following natural assumptions .",
    "the linear dimensions of @xmath31 are small compared to the distance @xmath39 between the source and the screen , and the angles between @xmath39 and the line joining a typical source point @xmath40 to @xmath37 and @xmath38 are small . dividing the source into elements @xmath41 centered on points @xmath42 and denoting by @xmath43 and @xmath44 the disturbances at @xmath37 and @xmath38 due to element @xmath41 , for total disturbances at these points one finds @xmath45 correlation function between the light signals @xmath46 and @xmath47 takes the form    @xmath48 because of mutual incoherence , the light signals coming from different elements of the source are statistically independent , that is , there is no correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath49 when @xmath50 @xmath51 the signals @xmath52 represent spherical waves coming to the points @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the elements @xmath41 @xmath53}\\over    r_{m1,2 } }   ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 denote distances between the elements @xmath41 and the points @xmath55 . using eq.([sphwaves ] ) for the correlation function one",
    "finds    @xmath56    if the path difference @xmath57 is small compared to the coherence length ( duration of the wave packet @xmath35 ) one can neglect the retardation @xmath57 in the argument of @xmath58 in eq.([intcond ] ) that gives @xmath59 the quantity @xmath60 characterizes the intensity of the radiation from the source element @xmath41 .",
    "so the correlation function eq.([corfunc ] ) takes the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 . in most applications the intensity @xmath63 may be assumed to be uniform on @xmath31 . to work out the integral eq.([corfunc1 ] ) let us denote by @xmath64 the coordinates of a point @xmath40 , referred to axes at @xmath65 , and let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be the coordinates of @xmath37 and @xmath38 referred to parallel axes at @xmath68 , see fig.1 . retaining only leading terms in @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the distance @xmath39 , one finds @xmath71 denoting @xmath72 the eq.([corfunc1 ] ) takes the form @xmath73 for a uniform circular source of radius @xmath74 with its center at @xmath65 , the eq.([corfunc2 ] ) reduces to    @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 stands for the bessel function of the first kind and first order . in most applications the quantity",
    "@xmath78 is very small , so that one can neglect corresponding phase factor in eq.([mutcoh ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath79 decreases steadily from the value @xmath80 when @xmath81 to the value zero when @xmath82 indicating that the degree of coherence steadily decreases and approaches complete incoherence when @xmath37 and @xmath38 are separated by the distance @xmath83 in experiments on interference and diffraction a departure of @xmath84 per cent from the ideal value of coherence that occurs at @xmath85 can be taken as a maximum permissible departure that gives for the separation of points @xmath86 and @xmath38 @xmath87",
    "as it was said in the introduction , due to quantum - gravitational fluctuations of the background metric the length scale @xmath8 undergoes fluctuations of the order of @xmath88 eq.([lenunc ] ) . because of background metric fluctuations there is an increment of the wave packet width which can be simply estimated by using the eq.([lenunc ] ) @xmath89",
    "a wavelength of the light from stellar objects considered in @xcite is in the region @xmath90 m and correspondingly for the width increment of a wave packet from eq.([width ] ) one finds ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 is of order unity ) @xmath91 in addition we need to check an important requirement that the path difference @xmath92 is still smaller than @xmath93 .",
    "we have @xmath94 , where with respect to the observational data considered in @xcite , @xmath95 is in the range @xmath96 m - @xmath97 m ( the distance between two slits of the interferometer ) .",
    "recalling that @xmath12 and @xmath13 takes on reasonable values , for the wavelength @xmath90 m from eq.([width1 ] ) one finds @xmath98 so one infers that there is no change in the coherence picture due to fluctuations of @xmath99 .",
    "the observational data considered in @xcite are collected from high - redshift astronomical sources with maximum @xmath100 .",
    "so that the photons left the sources at the shorter wavelength @xmath101 .",
    "but it is easy to see that the above conclusions do not change by inclusion the factor @xmath100 .    in light of the observational data considered in @xcite , the maximum value of @xmath78 reads @xmath102 and corresponding phase factor in eq.([mutcoh ] )",
    "may evidently be neglected .",
    "now by taking the variations of @xmath103 in eq.([explim ] ) one finds @xmath104 let us estimate the maximum of this variation by choosing the corresponding parameters from the data @xcite , that is , @xmath105kpc , @xmath106 cm , @xmath107 cm . for this set of parameters from eq.([effrate ] )",
    "one finds @xmath108 which for @xmath109 ( that gives a maximum as @xmath12 ) yields    @xmath110    so that the observations analyzed in @xcite have no chance to detect the quantum gravitational fluctuations described by the eq.([lenunc ] ) for any reasonable value of @xmath13 and @xmath111 .",
    "the effect to be somewhat appreciable the ratio @xmath112 should not be highly suppressed , that is , it should be possible to control the length @xmath113 with the accuracy @xmath114 .",
    "first let us outline how the problem of light incoherence from distant astronomical sources caused by the qg fluctuations of the background metric was treated in the previous study . in paper",
    "@xcite the authors assumed that the light coming from the distant extragalactic sources ( the diffraction / interference images of which are seen through the two slit telescopes ) is coherent from the beginning , but accumulates appreciable phase incoherence if the length of propagation , @xmath115 , is large enough .",
    "phase incoherence accumulates at the expense of factor @xmath116 and becomes sufficiently large even for small values of @xmath25 ( @xmath25 is caused by the qg fluctuations of the background metric ) when @xmath115 is large enough .",
    "so it is understood that the time dependance of the wave , @xmath117 , varies due to qg fluctuations as @xmath118 and because the second term is dominating it is taken as a main source of phase incoherence .",
    "the condition @xmath119 is understood as a criterion for incoherence that should lead to the destruction of the diffraction / interference patterns when the source is viewed through a telescope . from eq.([width1 ] ) one finds @xmath120 for a given @xmath28 and then readily estimates ( for a given value of @xmath121 ) the distance @xmath122 .    following this way of reasoning , in paper @xcite the distance through which the wave - front recedes when the phase increases by @xmath116 is taken as an error in measurement of a length , @xmath115 , by the light with wavelength @xmath123 , and due to this length variation an apparent blurring of distant point sources",
    "is estimated .",
    "those papers found the amplification of planck scale tiny qg effect to an extent that contradicts the existing observations of diffraction / interference images through the telescopes .    in order to mitigate the situation it was suggested in @xcite that the phase incoherence @xmath124 could be reduced by taking the factor @xmath125 instead of @xmath126 as it stands in eq.([cumfac ] ) . for motivating this step ,",
    "the authors of paper @xcite were assuming that in the case @xmath127 the fluctuations @xmath128 were expected to take on @xmath129 sign with equal probability and respectively had to add up over the length scale @xmath115 by the cumulative factor @xmath130 .",
    "then for other values of @xmath121 , the cumulative factor was assumed of the form @xmath125 .",
    "( this reduced expression for the phase incoherence is used in @xcite as well . ) first , one may question that as in the particular case @xmath131 the local fluctuations @xmath1 add up over the macroscopic scale @xmath8 to @xmath132 that obviously contradicts the argument that @xmath128 should also add by the same cumulative factor .",
    "second , what is most important , this artificial trick has nothing to do with the physics behind the phenomenon under consideration . as we see the approaches of these papers to the problem of stellar interferometry",
    "are oversimplified that leads to the misleading results .",
    "the ideology of papers @xcite has little to do with the theory of mutual coherence of light from an extended incoherent quasi - monochromatic source , that may be the only reliable way for a proper understanding of question under consideration .",
    "the discussion of our paper is based on the theory of mutual coherence of light from an extended incoherent quasi - monochromatic source ( which provides the basis of stellar interferometry ) .",
    "what we learn from this theory is that the light coming from a real astronomical source has a natural finite width @xmath120 from the very outset and the contribution to the width due to qg fluctuations is negligible .",
    "moreover , even were it not so this would not affect the mutual coherence of light as long as @xmath133 satisfies the conditions @xmath134 the rate of qg incoherence is discouragingly small as it is demonstrated by the eqs.([maxrate],[maxalphrate ] ) , to be detectable by the stellar interferometry observations considered in @xcite .",
