    "this paper explores approximation properties of finite smooth mixtures of normal regressions as flexible models for conditional densities .",
    "these models are a special case of mixtures of experts ( me ) introduced by @xcite .",
    "me have become increasingly popular is statistical literature since they are very flexible , easy to interpret and reasonably easy to estimate .",
    "see , for example , papers by @xcite and @xcite who employ the expectation maximization ( em ) estimation algorithm or papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and@xcite who use markov chain monte carlo methods for estimation of me in the bayesian framework .",
    "this paper contributes to the literature that provides a theoretical explanation of the success of me models in applications . in particular , i show that large classes of conditional densities can be approximated in the kullback  leibler ( kl ) distance by finite smooth mixtures of normal regressions .",
    "approximation results are obtained in the kl distance for the following reason .",
    "if a data generating density is in the kl closure of a class of models then this density can be consistently estimated from data by these models under weak regularity conditions [ see , e.g. , @xcite for a textbook treatment of schwarz s theorem on posterior consistency and @xcite for posterior consistency results for finite mixture of normals ] .",
    "consider a joint probability distribution @xmath0 on a product space @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "assume the conditional distribution @xmath4 has a density @xmath5 with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the marginal density of @xmath6 with respect to some generic measure is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "a model @xmath8 for the conditional density @xmath5 is described by @xmath9 .",
    "the kl distance between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 this distance can also be interpreted as the expected kl distance between the conditional distributions .",
    "either way , this is the distance useful for obtaining estimation consistency results .",
    "also , convergence in the kl distance implies convergence in the total variation distance .",
    "below , i consider several different specifications of mixture of normal regressions models , @xmath9 , and provide conditions on @xmath0 under which @xmath13 can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "i also derive rates of convergence and easy to interpret bounds for @xmath13 .",
    "in general , a finite mixture of normal regressions model can be written as @xmath14 where mixing probabilities satisfy @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a normal density with mean @xmath19 and standard deviation @xmath20 evaluated at @xmath21 ( if @xmath21 is multidimensional then the variance  covariance matrix is diagonal @xmath22 ) .",
    "most of the results obtained in the paper can be easily extended to models in which general location scale densities @xmath23 are mixed instead of the normal densities @xmath24 .",
    "models , in which the mixing weights depend on @xmath6 , are referred in this paper as smooth mixtures . in practice , @xmath25 s",
    "are often modeled by a multinomial choice model , for example , multinomial logit [ @xcite ] or probit [ @xcite ] , or it might not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "the mean @xmath26 can be constant , linear or flexible , for example , polynomial , in @xmath6 .",
    "an exponentiated polynomial or spline in @xmath6 can be used for modeling the standard deviation @xmath27 [ @xcite ] .    to the best of my knowledge ,",
    "previous literature on smooth mixtures of regressions ( or experts ) does not provide a theory on what specifications for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 deliver a model that can approximate and consistently estimate large nonparametric classes of densities @xmath0 .",
    "there are theoretical results on approximation of smooth functions and estimation of conditional expectations by me [ see @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "the only paper on approximation of conditional densities by me seems to be @xcite who develop approximation and estimation results for target densities from a single parameter exponential family , in which the parameter is a smooth function of covariates .",
    "a detailed comparison with results in @xcite is presented in section [ sec : comparison ] . in this paper ,",
    "i do not restrict the functional form of @xmath31 and use weak regularity conditions to describe a class of @xmath0 that can be approximated .",
    "conditions on approximable classes of @xmath31 and @xmath7 that are common for different model specifications include bounded support for @xmath7 , continuity of @xmath31 in @xmath32 , finite expectation of a change of @xmath33 in a neighborhood of @xmath21 and existence of the second moments of @xmath21 . the latter restriction can be weakened by adding densities with fat tails to the mixtures in addition to normal densities .    in section [ sec : lin_logit ] ,",
    "i show that considerable flexibility is already attained when @xmath28 s are modeled by multinomial logit with linear indices in @xmath6 , and @xmath34 are independent of @xmath6 .",
    "results in sections [ sec : poly_logit ] and [ sec : lin_logit ] suggest that using polynomials in the logit specification reduces the number of mixture components @xmath35 required to achieve a specified approximation precision . as shown in section [ sec : flex_mean ] , models for univariate response @xmath21 in which the mixing probabilities and the variances of the mixed normals are independent of @xmath6 , and the means are flexible , for example , polynomial in @xmath6 , can approximate large classes of @xmath31 .",
    "differences in quantiles of @xmath31 from these classes have to be bounded above and below uniformly in @xmath6 .",
    "these restrictions on @xmath31 can be weakened if the variances of the mixed normals are modeled by flexible functions of @xmath6 .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the findings .",
    "in this section , i explicitly construct a smooth mixture of normals model that converges to a given @xmath0 in the kl distance as @xmath35 increases .",
    "this model is not feasible in the sense that it is not based on components employed in practice , for example , logit / probit mixing probabilities .",

    "the fine part of the partition becomes finer , @xmath42 . also , it covers larger and larger part of @xmath38 : for any @xmath43 there exists @xmath44 such that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a hypercube with center @xmath21 and side length @xmath47 .",

    "here , i briefly describe the intuition behind the argument and the role of the assumptions .",
    "convergence in the kl distance is proved by the dominated convergence theorem ( dct ) .",
    "first , i establish point - wise convergence of the integrand , @xmath78 , to zero , and then i derive an integrable upper bound on the integrand for the dct applicability .",
    "nonnegativity of the kl distance is fruitfully exploited in the proof as it allows working only with upper bounds and ignoring the lower ones in convergence arguments .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : candidate_general_case ] ) ( the sum from 1 to @xmath35 ) approximates the integral @xmath79 when @xmath40 is much smaller than @xmath56 , and the fine part of the partition is large .",

    "thus , this intuitive argument explains the role of conditions ( [ eq : cond_delta_sigma_h ] ) and continuity of @xmath31 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : candidate_general_case ] ) converges to zero .",
    "this term is not needed for point - wise convergence .",
    "it can be omitted when the support of @xmath31 is bounded uniformly in @xmath6 as in this case we can set @xmath84 and use the same variance @xmath85 in all mixture components ( there is no need to define @xmath55 ) .",
    "this term together with part of assumption [ assn : general_case ] prevents tails of @xmath86 from becoming too thin relative to @xmath31 in the unbounded support case ( in the absence of this term the tails would be too thin as @xmath87 ) .",
    "parts and of assumption [ assn : general_case ] together guarantee existence of an integrable upper bound for the dct applicability .",
    "an upper bound on @xmath88 , @xmath89 involves a lower bound on @xmath90 . both terms on the right - hand side in the definition of @xmath90 in ( [ eq : candidate_general_case ] ) can be bounded below by an expression proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "that is how condition ( [ eq : intboundfinff ] ) is deduced .",
    "the lower bound for the second term in ( [ eq : candidate_general_case ] ) also includes @xmath92 and that is why finiteness of the second moments of @xmath21 is assumed .",
    "one interpretation of condition ( [ eq : intboundfinff ] ) [ part ( i ) of assumption [ assn : general_case ] ] is that local relative changes in @xmath31 due to changes in @xmath21 should not be infinitely large on average .",
    "it seems difficult to think of an unconditional density , which is well behaved and positive everywhere , that would violate ( [ eq : intboundfinff ] ) .",
    "this part of the assumption though can be violated by reasonable conditional densities as example  [ ex : exponential ] below illustrates .    .",
    "]    when @xmath31 is positive everywhere , part ( ii ) of assumption [ assn : general_case ] is not needed .",
    "it always holds if @xmath60 is a hypercube with center at @xmath21 . part ( ii )",
    "becomes important when @xmath31 can be equal to zero .",
    "in particular , the sets @xmath68 and @xmath72 in part ( ii ) of assumption [ assn : general_case ] are introduced to specify that @xmath60 needs to be defined differently near the boundary of the support and in the tails if one wants to use condition ( [ eq : intboundfinff ] ) in its present form .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : cryx ] .",
    "the support of @xmath93 should include @xmath60 a.s .",
    "@xmath0 ; otherwise , part ( i ) of assumption [ assn : general_case ] is not satisfied",

    "results in this section and similar results in the following sections can be generalized in several different ways .",
    "first , the derivation of the integrable upper bound in the proof of proposition [ prp : gen_case ] suggests that the requirement of finite second moments of @xmath21 can be weakened by adding a density with thicker than normal tails to the mixture of normals ; for example , substitute @xmath92 in ( [ eq : candidate_general_case ] ) with a student @xmath102-density .",
    "second , more general shapes of the support of @xmath0 can be accommodated if instead of hypercubes @xmath60 , @xmath68 , and @xmath72 in assumption [ assn : general_case ] different sets with positive lebesgue measure are used .",
    "for example , if the support of @xmath93 is a triangle in @xmath103 then small triangles can be used instead of the squares @xmath60 , @xmath68 and @xmath72 .",
    "third , general location scale densities @xmath104 can be used in mixtures instead of normal densities . as long as analogs of lemmas [ lm : boundrsbyint_esp ] , [ lm : boundintby1 ] and [ lm : boundrs_epp_new ] ( see the )",
    "are available for a particular type of densities , results in this and the following sections will hold for mixtures of these densities .",
    "lemmas [ lm : boundrsbyint_esp ] and [ lm : boundrs_epp_new ] hold for @xmath104 if @xmath105 is bounded and nonincreasing in @xmath106 ( proofs of the lemmas use only these facts about the normal distributions ) . the derivation of bounds in lemma [ lm : boundintby1 ] exploits normality ; however , the qualitative results of the lemma hold as long as @xmath107 and @xmath105 is positive in a neighborhood of zero . thus , all the results in this paper that establish @xmath108 do not depend on the normality assumption ; however , bounds and convergence rates for @xmath13 derived below are specific to mixtures of normal densities , and they might be different for mixtures of other densities .",
    "all these generalizations seem to be straight forward and i do not pursue them in this paper to keep the arguments short and simple .",
    "examples below demonstrate that assumption [ assn : general_case ] is satisfied for a large class of densities .",
    "they also describe some situations in which the assumption fails .",
    "[ ex : exponential ] exponential distribution , @xmath109 , .",
    "the density is continuous in @xmath21 ( part of assumption [ assn : general_case ] ) .",

    "most importantly , i do not assume that functional form of @xmath31 is known , for example , known @xmath404 , @xmath394 , @xmath395 and @xmath165 .",
    "the components of the model i employ , for example , normal densities and logit mixing probabilities , are generally not related to the true density . as examples [ ex : inf_student ] and [ ex : inf_cont_bddsupport ] and corollary [ crl : flex_mean_bddsupport ] illustrate ,",
    "many densities that are not from ( [ eq : exp_family ] ) are shown to be approximable by me models .",
    "examples [ ex : exponential ] and [ ex : exponential_flex_mean ] also show that some of the densities from class ( [ eq : exp_family ] ) satisfy sufficient conditions for approximation results i obtain .",
    "however , there might exist densities from ( [ eq : exp_family ] ) that violate these sufficient conditions .",
    "this would not be surprising since the `` correct '' functional forms are mixed in ( [ eq : jtmodel ] ) . for the same reason it is not surprising that the approximation rate obtained by @xcite , @xmath403 , differs from the ones obtained here , for example , @xmath405}$ ] for model @xmath221 in corollary [ crl : linlogit_case_bounds ] .",
    "finally , responses in @xcite class ( [ eq : exp_family ] ) can be discrete , for example , poisson . to accommodate discrete responses in the framework of the present paper one could map the discrete values of response @xmath21 into a partition of @xmath191 and introduce a corresponding latent variable @xmath406 .",
    "for example , for binary @xmath407 let @xmath408 if @xmath409 and @xmath410 if @xmath411 .",
    "any discrete distribution can be represented by a continuously distributed latent variable in this fashion .",
    "this continuous distribution can be flexibly modeled by @xmath412 .",
    "models with latent variables are easy to estimate in the bayesian framework using mcmc methods [ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "this paper shows that large classes of conditional densities can be approximated in the kullback  leibler distance by different specifications of finite smooth mixtures of normal densities or regressions .",
    "the theory can be generalized to smooth mixtures of location scale densities .",
    "these results have interesting implications for applied researchers .",
    "first of all , smooth mixtures of densities or experts can be used as flexible models for estimation of multivariate conditional densities .",
    "it seems this issue has not been explored in the literature and it would be interesting to see how specifications studied in the paper work in these settings .",
    "second , smooth mixtures of simple components , for example , models in which mixing probabilities are modeled by multinomial logit linear in covariates and the means and variances do not depend on covariates , can be quite flexible .",
    "a  simulation study in @xcite suggests though that models with more complex components perform better in practice .",
    "this issue should be further explored in simulation studies .",
    "third , results in section [ sec : lin_logit ] suggest that making mixing probabilities more flexible , for example , by using polynomials in logit , might reduce the number of necessary mixture components . however , these models are more difficult to estimate .",
    "fourth , models in which mixing probabilities do not depend on covariates can be very flexible at least for univariate response variables .",
    "however , they seem to require a lot of mixture components and very flexible models for the means of the mixed normals .",
    "also , approximation error bounds and convergences rates ( example [ ex:2side_exp_flex_mean_rates ] ) obtained in section [ sec : flex_mean ] suggest that models with flexible mixing probabilities might perform better in practice than models with flexible means of the mixed normals and constant mixing probabilities",
    ". nevertheless , it would be interesting to see how these specifications perform in actual applications and simulation studies .",
    "on the basis of a simulation study , @xcite generally recommend using heteroscedastic experts ( mixture components with variances that depend on covariates ) .",
    "the theory obtained here suggests that heteroscedastic experts might be necessary when differences in quantiles of @xmath93 are not uniformly bounded in @xmath6 and , especially , when the support bounds of @xmath93 are increasing without a bound in @xmath6 ( see examples [ ex : infeasible_unifrm ] and [ ex : uniform_flex_mean ] ) .",
    "this suggestion is likely to remain useful when the differences in quantiles and/or support of @xmath93 , although bounded , still change considerably with covariates .",
    "practical implications of the theoretical results obtained in the paper and summarized in this section are deduced under the assumption of no estimation and parameter uncertainty .",
    "exploring the behavior of the estimation error in addition to the approximation error would result in a more complete understanding of the me models .",
    "this issue is left for future work .",
    "overall , the paper provides a number of encouraging approximation results for ( smooth ) mixtures of densities or experts which might stimulate more theoretical and applied work in this area of research .",

    "<S> this paper shows that large nonparametric classes of conditional multivariate densities can be approximated in the kullback  leibler distance by different specifications of finite mixtures of normal regressions in which normal means and variances and mixing probabilities can depend on variables in the conditioning set ( covariates ) . </S>",
    "<S> these models are a special case of models known as `` mixtures of experts '' in statistics and computer science literature . </S>",
    "<S> flexible specifications include models in which only mixing probabilities , modeled by multinomial logit , depend on the covariates and , in the univariate case , models in which only means of the mixed normals depend flexibly on the covariates . modeling </S>",
    "<S> the variance of the mixed normals by flexible functions of the covariates can weaken restrictions on the class of the approximable densities . </S>",
    "<S> obtained results can be generalized to mixtures of general location scale densities . </S>",
    "<S> rates of convergence and easy to interpret bounds are also obtained for different model specifications . </S>",
    "<S> these approximation results can be useful for proving consistency of bayesian and maximum likelihood density estimators based on these models . </S>",
    "<S> the results also have interesting implications for applied researchers .    .    </S>"
