    "exclusive hadron production in high energy electron - positron annihilation is a very interesting task for theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "the presence of high energy scale @xmath7 that is much greater than typical hadronic scale allows one to separate the amplitude of such processes into hard part ( creation of quarks at very small distances ) and soft part ( subsequent hadronization of these quarks into experimentally observed mesons at larger distances ) .",
    "the first part of the amplitude can be calculated within perturbative qcd .",
    "the second part of the amplitude is described by distribution amplitudes ( da ) , which contain nonperturbative properties of final hadrons .",
    "the description of hard exclusive hadron production within this pattern gives some very interesting predictions of the properties of hard exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "one of such prediction is the asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes and cross sections of hard exclusive processes in the limit @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this behavior is determined by the perturbative part of amplitude and quantum numbers of final hadrons and does not depend on das of final hadrons .    to give quantitative prediction for the cross section of hard exclusive process one needs to know das .",
    "it is interesting to note that if das are known the theory can equivalently well predict the cross sections for the production of hadrons composed of light ( @xmath9 quarks ) or heavy quarks ( @xmath10 quarks ) .",
    "there is well known example of exclusive process with heavy quarkonia production @xmath11 measured at belle @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations .",
    "this process was extensively studied in many papers @xcite within different approaches , what led to a better understanding of charmonia properties and production processes .",
    "it is important to note that the approach to hard exclusive processes described above leads to a reasonable agreement with the experiments .    in this paper",
    "we study the processes @xmath12 , where @xmath1 .",
    "experimental measurement of the cross section of the process @xmath2 at babar collaboration at large center mass energy @xmath3 gev and some low energy experimental data @xmath4 gev allow us to study the cross section of this process in the broad energy region .",
    "our first purpose is to use these data in order to determine the asymptotic behavior of the cross section of the process @xmath13 . assuming that the same asymptotic behavior is valid for the other processes under consideration and using low energy experimental data one can predict the cross sections of the @xmath12 at energies @xmath6 gev .",
    "in addition , we apply perturbative qcd approach to estimate the values of the cross sections for the processes under consideration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we analyze the experimental data for the process @xmath2 and determine the asymptotic behavior of this cross section .",
    "then we apply the result of this study to predict the cross sections of the other processes under consideration at the center mass energies @xmath6 gev . in section [ sec : light - cone ] we give theoretical predictions for the cross sections @xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath18 gev and 10.6 gev and compare them with available experimental data .",
    "the final section is devoted to the discussion of the results of this paper .",
    "the amplitude of the process involved can be written in the following form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are electron and positron bispinors , @xmath23 is the invariant mass of @xmath24 system squared and @xmath25 is electromagnetic current .",
    "the matrix element @xmath26 can be parameterized by the only formfactor @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the polarization vector of meson @xmath30 .",
    "the cross section of the process under consideration equals @xmath31 in the last formula @xmath32 is the momentum of the vector meson @xmath30 in the center mass frame of final mesons .",
    "process.[fig : diags ] ]    in this section we will be interested in the asymptotic behavior of the formfactor @xmath27 in the high energy region .",
    "typical diagrams of the process under consideration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] . the asymptotic behavior of the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags]a is @xmath33 . at extremely large energies",
    "this diagram gives the dominant contribution .",
    "however , the amplitude of this diagram is suppressed by the smallness of the electromagnetic coupling constant and our study shows that in the energy region analyzed in this paper the contribution of this diagram is negligible .",
    "further let us consider the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags]b , c . according to perturbative qcd @xcite amplitudes ( [ eq : matr ] ) from such diagrams",
    "have the following asymptotic behavior @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are mesons with momenta @xmath37 , @xmath38 and helicities @xmath39 and @xmath40 . for the process under consideration",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the vector and pseudoscalar mesons respectively .",
    "the helicity of the pseudoscalar meson is , obviously , @xmath41 .",
    "because of antisymmetric tensor in ( [ eq : matr ] ) , longitudinal polarization of the vector meson is forbidden and it is transversely polarized ( @xmath42 .",
    "so , we have @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , in papers @xcite , it was stated that experimental data can be described only by the dependence @xmath45 .",
    "to clarify this situation we will parameterize the formfactor @xmath27 by the expression @xmath46 where @xmath47 slightly depends on @xmath48 due to power and logarithmic corrections to the leading asymptotic behavior . later in this section",
    "we will neglect such dependence .",
    "this approximation allows us to fix the constants @xmath49 from the low energy data and predict the cross sections at @xmath18 gev and 10.6 gev .",
    "we check three different hypothesis ( @xmath50 and 5 ) and compare the results with existing experimental data .",
    "first we are going to consider the process @xmath51 . to fix the constants @xmath49",
    "one can use low energy data @xcite .",
    "when the constants @xmath49 for different hypothesis are fixed , one can use them to predict the cross section in the high energy region and then compare this prediction with available high energy data @xcite measured by babar collaboration @xmath52 our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phieta ] and table [ tab : params ] . from these figure and table",
    "it can be clearly seen , that only @xmath53 describes satisfactory low and high energy experimental babar data @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with the predictions of perturbative qcd .",
    "[ fig : phieta ] one can see that low energy cleo - c data @xcite are in disagreement with hypothesis @xmath50 .",
    "only hypotheses @xmath54 does not contradict to the experimental results .",
    "however , if we assume that this hypotheses is correct we will faced with dramatic contradiction with the high energy babar data ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phieta ] and table [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "it should be also noted that in papers @xcite it was stated that the energy dependence @xmath55 describes experimental data more accurately .",
    "we believe that the disagreement of this statement with our conclusion arises from the fact that the authors of papers @xcite did not take into account low energy experimental result @xcite .    in view of this",
    "the question arises : is it possible to use asymptotic behavior of the cross section ( [ asympt ] ) in the region @xmath56 gev .",
    "first , one can estimate the cross uncertainty due to the power corrections as @xmath57 .",
    "even , for the heaviest meson @xmath58 and the smallest @xmath59 from the region @xmath56 the error is @xmath60 .",
    "we can also determine the size of power corrections from the fitting data @xcite by the asymptotic form ( [ asympt ] ) plus next - to - leading - order power correction .",
    "our analysis shows that the uncertainty is not greater than @xmath61 .",
    "we believe that these arguments confirm the applicability of the asymptotic expression for the cross section .",
    "now let us consider the processes @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "unfortunately at the moment only the low energy cleo - c data @xcite are available for these processes . as it is seen from tab .",
    "[ tab : params ] the experimental error of these data are rather large .",
    "more precise experimental data can be obtained from the decays @xmath64 .",
    "corresponding branching fraction are equal to @xcite @xmath65 generally speaking , these decays can proceed both via strong and electromagnetic interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ diag : psi ] for the typical diagrams ) . because of the isospin violation , however , the gluon induced diagrams are strongly suppressed , and purely electromagnetic diagram gives the dominant contribution .",
    "the branching fraction of these decays are equal to @xmath66 from this relation we can determine the value of the function @xmath67 ) and , neglecting energy dependence in @xmath47 ( this assumptions leads to additional errors , which can be estimated as @xmath68 ) , predict the cross sections of the processes @xmath62 and @xmath63 over the large energy region .",
    "the results are shown in figs . [",
    "fig : rhoeta ] , [ fig : rhoetap ] and table [ tab : params ] . from these results",
    "it is seen that the low energy data do not allow to understand what hypotheses gives the best agreement with the experiments .",
    "so , to determine the asymptotic behavior unambiguously the high energy data are needed .",
    "however , if we assume that the asymptotic behavior for the cross section of the process @xmath51 is the same as that for the processes @xmath62 , @xmath63 , one can predict the cross sections of these processes at energies @xmath69 gev @xmath70 the cross sections at the energy @xmath71 gev are in agreement with the cleo - c data .    .",
    "the constants @xmath72 are fixed from the experimental values of this cross section in the low energy region ( @xmath73).[fig : phieta ] ]     decay[diag : psi],title=\"fig : \" ] decay[diag : psi],title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "the constants @xmath72 are fixed from the @xmath74 branching fraction ( the rightmost point represents the cross section at @xmath75 calculated using relations ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : br ] ) . ) [ fig : rhoeta ] ]    .",

    "experimental information is even more poor . in the case",
    "one can not use the branching fraction of the decay @xmath79 , since in this case isospin is conserved and the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ diag : psi]a gives the main contribution to @xmath80 decay .",
    "in addition , cleo - c gives us only upper bound on the cross section @xmath17 , and no experimental information in high energy region is available . using @xmath81 mixing it is possible , however , to estimate the cross section @xmath82 from the value of the @xmath83 cross section .",
    "the mixing of pseudoscalar mesons can be described by different parameterizations @xcite . in our paper",
    "we will use the parametrization of @xmath81 mixing in quark flavor basis with one mixing angle @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 represents the basis of the quark mixing scheme . using this mixing scheme",
    "it is easy to obtain the following relation between @xmath83 and @xmath87 cross sections : @xmath88    there are plenty of theoretical and experimental works dedicated to the determination of the mixing angle .",
    "the well known estimation , based on gell - mann - okubo mass formulas give the value of @xmath89 about @xmath90 for linear mass formula and about @xmath91 for a quadratic case .",
    "the analysis of the axial anomaly generated decays @xmath92 was performed in papers @xcite and the estimate @xmath93 was obtained . in papers",
    "@xcite another anomaly based investigation of a large set of decay processes was performed and the value @xmath94 was presented .",
    "the authors of the recent work @xcite used dispersive approach to @xmath81 mixing and obtained the value @xmath95 it is interesting to note that this value is close to phenomenological value @xmath96 , presented in pioneering work @xcite .",
    "we will use this value of the mixing angle in our article .",
    "the error of this angle is small in comparison with the error in @xmath83 cross section .    knowing the value of the cross section @xmath97 one can determine the value of the cross section @xmath82 at the energy @xmath3 gev .",
    "@xmath98 from this we can calculate the value of the constants @xmath72 for different hypothesis and predict the cross section of the process @xmath87 in the low energy region .",
    "we show the energy dependence of this cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : phietap ] . from this figure",
    "one sees that the value @xmath54 contradicts experimental results at @xmath18 gev , while @xmath99 and @xmath53 do not . from theoretical arguments and presented above analysis of @xmath83 reaction we think , that the value @xmath53 is more preferable .",
    "for this hypothesis we can predict the value of the cross section at energy @xmath71 gev @xmath100 which does not contradict to the cleo - c data .    in table",
    "[ tab : params ] we present the results of this section .",

    "the results of the calculation are shown in the forth and sixth columns . from this table",
    "it is clear , that only relation @xmath103 agrees with experiment .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the following point deserves consideration .",
    "the models for the das that we use in our calculation are truncated series in gegebauer polynomials .",
    "this means that the end point behavior ( @xmath104 ) of these das coincides with the end point behavior of the corresponding asymptotic das . from this",
    "it is not difficult to see that the integral @xmath105 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "one way to regularize this divergence is to introduce cut off parameter @xmath106 . in our calculation",
    "we take the following value of cut off parameter @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 is of order of typical hadronic scale , which is of order of several hundreds mev .",
    "physical meaning of this cut off can be understood as follows : if @xmath109 quark momentum is of order of @xmath110 and in this region one must take into account transverse motion in hadron what regularizes the whole integral @xmath105 .",
    "the parameter @xmath108 can be determined from available experimental results .",
    "we determined this parameter from the cross section of the process @xmath111 at @xmath112 gev .",

    "it should be noted here that in addition to the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] , there is additional contribution to the formfactor @xmath27 which was not considered in this paper .",

    "this contribution was considered in papers @xcite . in paper",
    "@xcite the authors asserted that the fock state @xmath115 gives very important contribution to the cross section and must be taken into account .",
    "contrary to this conclusion , the author of paper @xcite asserted that the main contribution arises from the diagrams shown in fig .",
