    "bipolar relativistic jets are common features in a variety of astrophysical objects , most notably in galactic black holes ( gbhs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . accretion of gas onto black holes is thought to power these collimated outflows .",
    "however , the details of the jet formation as well as the nature of the coupling between accreting matter and outflows are still among the outstanding open questions in high energy astrophysics .    because of their vicinity and hence their high brightness ,",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of gbhs are much better known and can be used to infer information on their more powerful , extragalactic analogs . indeed considerable progress in this field has been made by multi - wavelength correlated studies of gbhs in different spectral states , which allow one to study the link between accretion ( generally probed by the x - ray emission ) and jet properties ( in the radio regime ) on `` human '' timescales .",
    "it is now well established that gbhs undergo state transitions , switching between two main states : the low / hard ( ls ) and the high / soft state ( hs ) passing through soft and hard intermediate states ( is ) , which are also named very high states ( vhs ) when they occur at high values of accretion rate ( see @xcite for recent comprehensive reviews on gbhs ) .",
    "each spectral state is unambiguously characterized by a specific combination of x - ray temporal and spectral properties and by well defined radio features ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the study of the disk - jet link one of the most interesting spectral states",
    "is the is / vhs , which is generally characterized by powerful transient relativistic ejections in the radio coupled with highly variable x - ray emission that is unambiguously associated with the accretion flow , unlike the ls where the origin of the x - rays is still matter of debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the physical conditions that lead to the transient relativistic ejections during the is / vhs are still poorly understood mostly because of their short duration in gbhs .",
    "since the dynamical time scales are proportional to the black hole mass , in individual agns it is not possible to observe long - term phenomena occurring in gbhs such as the canonical spectral transitions . on the other hand",
    ", agns may provide better constraints on short - lived gbh phenomena and hence shed light on the jet formation and the interplay between accretion and ejection processes .",

    "the  campaign in september 2008 confirms the presence of strong variability in the x - ray band of  and reveals the presence of moderate variability in the uv bands , whereas the optical bands appear to be consistent with the hypothesis of constant flux over short timescales .",
    "one of the best ways to get insights into the energetic of the central engine in  and in agns in general is to study the broadband sed , as demonstrated by numerous successful past studies ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "the resulting spectra were then combined with the 0.310 kev epic spectra and fitted in ` xspec ` with a model that comprises a disk and two comptonization components : _",
    "diskpn+wabs(bmc+bmc)_. only the comptonization models are absorbed by the galactic @xmath80 , because the optical and uv data were already corrected for absorption .",
    "as explained in @xmath98 the bmc is a simple but comprehensive comptonization model that can fit both thermal and bulk comptonization processes .",
    "the use of a comptonization model to parametrize the soft excess below 2 kev is guided by a thorough spectral analysis of the highest quality  spectra , which suggests that this component may arise from a hot `` skin '' in the innermost part of the disk in objects that accrete at rates close or above the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "for the hard x - rays we also used a bmc model instead of the phenomenological power law model ( pl ) because the bmc parameters are computed in a self - consistent way , and , unlike the pl , the power law produced by bmc does not extend to arbitrarily low energies and thus does not affect the normalization of the thermal component nor the amount of local absorption .",

    "we then fitted the x - ray spectra by linking the temperature of seed photons of both comptonization models to @xmath99 .",

    "the main goal of this work is to investigate the energetic of the radio - loud nls1  and shed some light on the nature of its central engine . to this end , it is first necessary to assess the role played by the jet and more specifically whether the jet may dominate the high energy emission of .",

    "therefore , for the rest of the paper we will assume that the bulk of the optical - uv - x - ray emission is associate with the accretion flow only .",
    "the main result from the analysis of the broadband sed ( described in @xmath132 ) is that the emission of  is dominated by a weakly variable uv bump ( @xmath133 ) , which is commonly associated with the emission from the accretion disk .",

    "since @xmath96 provides a measurement of the variability normalized over the average flux , a measurement of the  true \" variability ( hereafter @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively ) can be obtained by multiplying @xmath96 by the respective average flux .",

    "leads to an accretion rate of @xmath142 that strongly suggests that  accretes at super - eddington rate .",
    "note that with the less conservative assumption of @xmath143 ( which corresponds to a lower eddington luminosity and a higher bolometric luminosity ) , the accretion rate in eddington units would be of the order of @xmath144 .",
    "having measured the x - ray and bolometric luminosity over a period of ten days , it is possible to compute not only the average bolometric correction @xmath145 but also to investigate if it varies over time . from table 3",
    "we infer that @xmath146 indeed varies by a factor of @xmath02.5 ranging between 108 and 249 , with an average value of @xmath147 ( where the error quoted is 1@xmath90 ) .",
    "the large value of @xmath146 appears to be in qualitative agreement with recent studies that suggest that the x - ray bolometric correction is directly proportional to the eddington ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a more quantitative comparison can be performed using the recent results presented by @xcite , which are based on the optical and x - ray study of a sample of 545 x - ray selected type 1 agns from the xmm - cosmos survey . more specifically , plugging @xmath148 ( the value of the eddington ratio derived for ) into equation ( 14 ) from @xcite we derive @xmath149 , which is fully consistent with the average value empirically derived from the sed .",
    "since  possesses a radio jet , it is instructive to estimate the the inflow accretion rate and try to compare it to the the outflow mass rate associated with the jet , and similarly compare the accretion luminosity to the kinetic power . with the reasonable assumption that @xmath150 , we derive an accretion inflow rate of @xmath151 , assuming a typical radiative efficiency of @xmath152 ( larger values of @xmath153 are obtained if photon trapping effects play a significant role causing @xmath71 to decrease considerably ) .",
    "following @xcite it is possible to derive an estimate of the kinetic power of the jet for radio galaxies by making use of the formula @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the nuclear radio luminosity at 5 ghz . using the value measured with the , @xmath156 , we derive a kinetic power of the order of @xmath157 .",

    "we can now test this analogy in a more quantitative way .",
    "first , we can compare the results from the energetic section relative to the disk - jet interaction with the findings of @xcite that are derived from radiation - magneto - hydrodynamic simulations of a stellar bh system accreting at the eddington rate .",
    "the general agreement with the simulations ( specifically , @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) lends further support to the hypothesis that  is a large scale analog of a gbh in a highly accreting state .    the analogy with the is / vhs",
    "is supported by the direct comparison of with gro j1655 - 40 in the @xmath73 diagram that we used to estimate the black hole mass ( see fig .  [ figure : fig3 ] ) .",
    "specifically , the common spectral variability trend occurs when gro j1655 - 40 is switching from the ls to the hs ( i.e. , the source is indeed in the is ) during the rise of the outburst in march 2005 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray outburst of gro j1655 - 40 was accompanied by enhanced emission in the radio band that faded before the peak of the x - ray outburst . based on the values reported by @xcite ,",

    "further support to this conclusion comes from the comparison of the broadband spectral index @xmath165 of  with the corresponding quantity @xmath166 , which was recently introduced by @xcite to characterize the broadband spectrum of gbhs and allows a direct comparison with agns . during our short multi - wavelength campaign in october 2008 , @xmath165 ranged between 1.251.4 while the photon index varied from 2.12.25 .",
    "importantly , this is the very range corresponding to the intermediate state in gbhs ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) .    finally , it is instructive to compare  to grs 1915 + 105 , which is thought to be the only microquasar that regularly accretes at or above the eddington limit .",
    "interestingly , during its spectral transition hard - to - soft the x - ray spectra of grs 1915 + 105 are well fitted by two bmc components ( a hard component with @xmath1671.73 and a soft component with @xmath1672.74.2 ) which evolve following the trend shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig3 ] @xcite .",
    "also for grs 1915 + 105 the location of the is / vhs in the @xmath73 diagram is consistent with the position of  ( see figure 13 of @xcite ) .      in conclusion",
    ", our multiwavelength analysis of the emission properties of ranging between the radio and the hard x - rays reveals that this source has a radio jet , yet it is accreting at the eddington level or above .",
    "all our findings appear to independently lend support to the hypothesis that   may be a large scale analog of the is observed in gbhs .",
    "but can we extend this analogy to the whole class of nls1s ?",

    "[ figure : fig2 ] ) . bearing in mind that  is by far the brightest nls1 in the x - ray band and that its x - ray luminosity is nearly 100 times the typical value of  normal \" radio - quiet nls1s , similar values of the order of @xmath169 for  normal \" nls1s would correspond to radio fluxes of the order of 1 mjy or less .",
    "this would explain why only a small minority of nls1s is detected in the radio band .",
    "additionally , it must be pointed out that in the is the radio ejections are transients , therefore , genuine radio - quiet nls1 might still represent large scale analogs of the is .",
    "it is also interesting to compare  with the radio - loud nls1s recently detected at @xmath2-rays .",
    "the latter are characterized by large values of the radio - loudness ( @xmath170 ) , by compact radio emission , and by seds that are dominated by two broad bumps typical of jet - dominated sources .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that these very radio - loud nls1s galaxies represent a the third class of @xmath2-ray emitting agns along with blazars and radio galaxies . in this perspective ,  can play a crucial role since it may represent the prototype of nls1s with a jet seen at large viewing angles .",

    "fermi / lat _ , similarly to radio galaxies that are considered the non - beamed parent population of blazars .    in summary",
    ", we can hypothesize that  is indeed a prototypical nls1 .",
    "since the jet appears to dominate only in the radio band , the emission associated with the accretion flow can be cleanly separated by that related to the jet .",
    "this makes  an ideal system to study the disk - jet interaction . in this framework ,",
