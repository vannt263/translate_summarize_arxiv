    "<S> we present the results for the masses of the doubly heavy baryons @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath2 obtained in the framework of the simple approximation within the nonperturbative string approach .    </S>",
    "<S> doubly heavy baryons are baryons that contain two heavy quarks , either @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> their existence is a natural consequence of the quark model of hadrons , and it would be surprising if they did not exist . in particular , data from the babar and belle collaborations at the slac and kek b - factories would be good places to look for doubly charmed baryons . </S>",
    "<S> recently the selex , the charm hadroproduction experiment at fermilab , reported a narrow state at @xmath6 mev decaying in @xmath7 , consistent with the weak decay of the doubly charged baryon @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the candidate is @xmath9 signal . </S>",
    "<S> another candidate particle is related by the replacement of a down by an up quark , so the mass difference is expected to be similar to that of the proton and neutron . </S>",
    "<S> selex , however , sees a mass difference 60 times larger @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether or not the states that selex reports turn out to be the first observation of doubly charmed baryons , studying their properties is important for a full understanding of the strong interaction between quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this talk is to present the results of the calculation @xcite of the masses of the doubly - heavy baryons obtained in a simple approximation within the nonperturbative qcd ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of the approach is the feynman - schwinger representation for the green function of the three quarks propagating in the nonperturbatibe confining background . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the time parameter along the trajectory of each quark is played by the fock - schwinger proper time . </S>",
    "<S> the proper and real times for each quark related via a new quantity that eventually plays the role of the dynamical quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the final result is the derivation of the effective hamiltonian , see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eh ] ) below . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the standard approach of the constituent quark model the dynamical masses @xmath10 are no longer free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> they are expressed in terms of the running masses @xmath11 defined at the appropriate scale of @xmath12  gev from the condition of the minimum of the baryon mass @xmath13 as function of @xmath10 : @xmath14 technically , this has been done using the einbein ( auxiliary fields ) approach , which is proven to be rather accurate in various calculations for relativistic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> this method was already applied to study baryon regge trajectories @xcite and very recently for computation of magnetic moments of light baryons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the essential point of this talk is that it is very reasonable that the same method should also hold for hadrons containing heavy quarks . as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we take as the universal parameter the qcd string tension @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we also include the perturbative coulomb interaction with the frozen coupling @xmath16 .    from experimental point of view , </S>",
    "<S> a detailed discussion of the excited @xmath17 states is probably premature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we consider the ground state baryons without radial and orbital excitations in which case tensor and spin - orbit forces do not contribute perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> then only the spin - spin interaction survives in the perturbative approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the eh has the following form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the non - relativistic kinetic energy operator , @xmath20 are the current quark masses and @xmath10 are the dynamical quark masses to be found from ( [ frac ] ) , and @xmath21 is the sum of the perturbative one gluon exchange potential @xmath22 and the string potential @xmath23 . the string potential has been calculated in @xcite as the static energy of the three heavy quarks : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the sum of the three distances @xmath26 from the string junction point .    </S>",
    "<S> the baryon wave function depends on the three - body jacobi coordinates @xmath27@xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath29 cyclic ) , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the appropriate reduced masses @xmath32 and @xmath33 is an arbitrary parameter with the dimension of mass which drops off in the final expressions .    in terms of the jacobi coordinates the kinetic energy operator @xmath19 is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the six - dimensional hyper - radius @xmath36 and @xmath37 is angular momentum operator whose eigen functions ( the hyperspherical harmonics ) are @xmath38}=-k(k+4)y_{[k]},\\ ] ] with @xmath39 being the grand orbital momentum . in terms of @xmath40}$ ] the wave function @xmath41 can be written in a symbolical shorthand as @xmath42}(\\omega).\\ ] ]    in the hyper radial approximation which we shall use below @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the centrifugal potential in the schrdinger equation for the radial function @xmath45 with a given @xmath39 @xmath46 is not zero even for @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> in terms of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 the potential @xmath49 has rather complicated structure . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath50 be the angle between the line from quark @xmath51 to quark @xmath52 and that from quark @xmath52 to quark @xmath53 . if @xmath50 are all smaller than 120@xmath54 , then the equilibrium junction position @xmath55 is @xmath56 where    @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath50 is equal to or greater than 120@xmath54 , the lowest energy configuration has the junction at the position of quark @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily seen that dependence on @xmath10 in equations ( [ torr ] ) is apparent and @xmath60 does not depend on quark masses as it should be .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ]    .the constituent quark masses @xmath10 and the ground state eigenvalues @xmath61 ( in units of gev ) for the various baryon states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fig ]    to calculate hadron masses we , as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , first renormalize the string potential : @xmath62 where the constants @xmath63 take into account the residual self - energy ( rse ) of quarks @xcite . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we adjust the rse constants @xmath63 to reproduce the center - of - gravity for baryons with a given flavor . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66    we keep these parameters fixed to calculate the masses given in table 2 , namely the spin  averaged masses ( computed without the spin  </S>",
    "<S> spin term ) of the lowest double heavy baryons . in this table </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our predictions with the results obtained using the additive non  relativistic quark model with the power - law potential @xcite , relativistic quasipotential quark model @xcite , the feynman - hellmann theorem @xcite and with the predictions obtained in the approximation of double heavy diquark @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the change of @xmath15 to @xmath67 increases the mass of @xmath8 by @xmath68 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative spin - spin interaction introduces an additional shift of the @xmath8 mass @xmath69 mev . </S>",
    "<S> note that the mass of @xmath8 is rather sensitive to the value of the running @xmath70-quark mass @xmath71 , see fig.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have employed the general formalism for the baryons , which is based on nonperturbative qcd and where the only inputs are @xmath15 , @xmath72 and two additive constants , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the residual self  energies of the light quarks . using this formalism </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed the calculations of the spin  </S>",
    "<S> averaged masses of baryons with two heavy quarks . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from table 2 that our predictions are especially close to those obtained in ref . </S>",
