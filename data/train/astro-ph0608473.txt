    "neutron star ( ns ) astronomy has been recently invigorated by the identification of a new class of magnetically dominated emitters .",
    "known as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , these objects are apparently young , isolated neutron stars ( nss ) , whose properties differ markedly from those of the crab pulsar , previously considered prototypical of the young nss ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "all axps and at least 3 of the 4 sgrs are identified as relatively slow ( @xmath5  s ) pulsars .",
    "many are located at the centers of recognized , young supernova remnants ( snrs ) , directly associating them with their supernova explosions .",
    "these objects emit predominantly at x - ray energies and are distinguished by their characteristic spectral signature .",
    "this radiation can not be accounted for by rotational energy losses alone , as for the radio pulsars , but is most likely powered by the decay of an enormous magnetic field characterized by a dipole with @xmath6  g , at the pole .",
    "collectively , these isolated nss are understood within the context of the magnetar theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "a unique pulsar has been discovered whose remarkable properties offer great promise for deciphering the emission mechanism(s ) of magnetars .",
    "is a 5.54  s x - ray pulsar whose measured and derived physical parameters are fully characteristic of an axp , but expresses behavior not previously associated with any such object ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .  is a transient axp ( taxp )  it was discovered during a bright impulsive outburst @xcite that is still fading steadily .",
    "even more surprising is the discovery of highly variable radio emission , providing the first confirmed example of radio flux from an axp @xcite , and the subsequent detection of radio pulsations at the x - ray period @xcite .",
    "the outburst that resulted in the detection of the transient axp occurred sometime between 2002 november and 2003 january @xcite .",
    "since then , over the course of a year , regular scans of the region with rxte  recorded an exponential flux decay with a time - constant of @xmath7  days from a maximum of @xmath8 erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 . in comparison ,",
    "the previous average quiescent flux , with its softer spectrum , gives @xmath11 erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 ( paper  i ) .",
    "this contrast is unprecedented for an axp .",
    "further rxteobservations yielded sgr - like episodes of bursts @xcite , similar to those seen from 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "a search for an optical / ir counterpart detected a fading ir source within the chandra  error circle , similar to ones associated with other axps , confirming its identification with @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the latest results from taxp  including new xmm - newton  observations extending to 2006 march .",
    "these observations allow us to characterize the spectral evolution of a taxp in outburst as it returns to quiescence .",
    "we show that the spectrum has now begun a marked transition back to the nominal quiescent state , with a distinct temperature and flux evolution .",
    "this long - term evolution provides the unique possibility of decomposing its fading spectral components in a manner unavailable for other magnetars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) ) . in the following , we used a revised distant to the ns , @xmath12 , quoted in units of @xmath13  kpc and based on the radio pulsar dm measurement of @xcite .",

    "instead , we find that a two - temperature blackbody model gives equally acceptable spectral fits but is better motivated physically ( see  5 ) . a summary of spectral results is presented in table  1 and the spectra , fitted with the double blackbody model , are displayed in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ( the 2003 oct observation is excluded here for clarity ) . although the hot blackbody component ( bb2 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] ) initially dominated the emission at low energies , it fades more rapidly than the cooler `` warm '' emission component ( bb1 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] ) .",
    "evidently the spectral fits after 2004 march deviate significantly at the lower end of the xmm - newton  energy band , below 0.7  kev .",
    "it is not yet clear if this is an instrumental artifact , however , taken at face value there seems to be an absorption feature at @xmath23  ev with a gaussian width of @xmath24  ev .",
    "the mean equivalent width of this feature is @xmath25  ev , but its strength is somewhat time dependent .",
    "perhaps as the hotter component contributes less , this feature becomes more evident , suggesting an association exclusively with the cooler component .",
    "further research is needed to quantify this feature and consider its reality , or physical implications .",
    "the spectrum of  can be thought of as the combined flux from two concentric emitters , `` hot spots '' , whose temperature and size are evolving at different rates , effectively changing the overall shape of the spectrum with time ( paper ii ) . with a set of spectral measurements spanning two and a half years",
    ", a clear trend has emerged .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the two components are shown in figure  [ fig : luminosity ] .",
    "this reveals a cooler component decreasing exponentially in time with @xmath0  d , while the hotter temperature flux declines with @xmath1  d. as might be expected , the shorter time constant is very close to the one described by the long - term flux above @xmath26  kev ( figure  [ fig : flux ] ) , where the hotter blackbody component dominates .",
    "however , the latest two data points show that this component has now fallen faster than the original exponential . although the _ bolometric luminosities _ of the two components are quite different at the latest epoch , their measured _ fluxes _ are now nearly equal in the @xmath27  kev range .",
    "we also note that , while it is possible to fit an alternative power - law decay model to the hot blackbody flux , such a model would require a decay index that steepens with time .",
    "based on the decay rates and approximate outburst time we estimate an initial bolometric luminosity for the two spectral components of @xmath28  erg  s@xmath10 and @xmath29  erg  s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the total luminosity at the peak of the outburst is comparable to that of a persistent axp , suggesting that this taxp is anomalously faint .",
    "we can now compute the implied fluences of @xmath30  erg and @xmath31  erg , for the two components , respectively .",

    "figure  [ fig : params ] displays the time histories of these parameters for each spectral component , obtained from the model fits . based on the three latest data points , the temperatures now show a definite cooling trend for each spectral component , as suggested by the broken line in figure  [ fig : params ] . prior to mid 2004 , the temperatures likely remained nearly constant , after which they both fell at a rate of @xmath34 per year ( @xmath35  kev  yr@xmath10 ; @xmath36  kev  yr@xmath10 ) .",
    "the size of the effective hot spots ( derived from the blackbody emission areas ) also followed distinct evolutions .",
    "the hot component has been shrinking exponentially since the initial xmm - newton  observation , while the warm component has steadily increased in size .",
    "a notable exception is the initial data point which deviates from the trend for both the areas and temperatures .",
    "this may be associated with a glitch or rotation instability , as suggested by the pulse timing results around this epoch (  3 ) .",
    "the area of the warm component ( @xmath37 ; table  1 ) may be reaching a maximum , corresponding to the whole ns surface .",
    "this would then provide a lower - limit on the ns radius of @xmath38  km , ignoring relativistic effects ( redshift and light bending ) .",
    "in contrast , the area of the hotter component continues to shrink and its contribution to the flux is severely diminished .     per year since mid 2004 .",

    "[ fig : params ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as shown in figure  [ fig : luminosity ] , the x - ray luminosity of taxp  has nearly returned to its historic quiescent level .",
    "this is also true of the temperature and inferred blackbody area .",
    "the pre - burst rosat  spectrum of 1992 march 7 is reasonably well fitted with a single blackbody of @xmath39  kev covering @xmath40  @xmath41 and @xmath42  erg  s@xmath10 ( paper i ) .",
    "the latest xmm - newtonspectrum that overlaps the rosat  band is again dominated by the cooler blackbody component .",
    "furthermore , the current pulsed fraction is consistent with the quiescent upper - limits .",
    "thus the double blackbody model is sufficient to describe the observed properties , and may not require a third `` quiescent '' component to explain the pre - outburst observations .",
    "xmm - newton  data from the next observing window ( 2006 september ) is likely to be consistent with the rosat  result in the soft energy band , effectively defining a return to the quiescence state .",
    "the barycentered pulse period of  measured at each xmm - newtonobserving epoch is shown in figure  [ fig : spindown ] .",
    "these data points were derived following the method outlined in paper  i. prior to epoch 2004 , the spin - down rate derived from the rxte  and initial xmm - newton  measurements were highly erratic , ranging from @xmath43  s  s@xmath10 ( @xcite ; paper  iii ) .",
    "this temporal behavior is likely associated with the outburst event .",
    "the latest period measurements suggest that the spin - down rate has settled down somewhat .",
    "a linear model fit to the last 5 period measurements yields a period derivative of @xmath44  s  s@xmath10 with a @xmath45 for 3 dof , corresponding to a null hypothesis probability of 0.27 .",
    "compared to the radio @xmath46  s  s@xmath10 of 17 march - 7 may @xcite , there is evidently still timing noise in the pulsar s spin - down .",

    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] displays the pulse profiles at each xmm - newton  epoch , folded at the best determined periods .",
    "the data has been broken up into six energy bands , with the corresponding background in each band subtracted .",
    "the pulsed fractions , defined as the pulsed emission divided by the total flux , are indicated on the corner of each panel of the figure .",
    "these profiles are aligned so that phase zero is the same at each epoch , for ease of comparison . in any case , within an observation , the phase zero does not change with energy .",
    "this suggests a geometric interpretation for the modulation , such as from localized emission on the rotating ns star surface .",
    "the pulsed fraction has generally decreased with time , most notably at x - ray energies below @xmath50  kev ; at higher energies the trend is less clear due to the large uncertainties derived for those pulsed fractions .",
    "furthermore , at all epochs , the pulsed fraction clearly increases with energy , an equally interesting result discussed below .",
    "the evolving spectral shape and pulse profiles of taxp  provide an important and unique ( so far ) diagnostic of the emission geometry , and ultimately , the emission mechanism(s ) of nss . because the spectrum is well modeled by two blackbody components , and the phase alignment of the pulse profiles are energy independent , it is most natural to consider emission from two concentric regions on the ns surface .",
    "the hot component is associated with a smaller hot - spot , while the blackbody model predicts a larger annulus for the warm component .",
    "the complete collection of observed pulsed fractions is consistent with this model .",
    "the smaller , hotter spot always dominates the spectrum above @xmath26  kev and offers a natural explanation for the higher modulation at these energies . however , at lower energies , this contribution gradually fades relative to cooler emission ( which is less modulated ) , contributing less and less to the pulsed emission over time .",
    "we note in passing that a fitted power - law spectral component would have to dominate the soft ( @xmath51  kev ) x - rays at _ all _ epochs , while varying in its contribution to the hard ( @xmath52  kev ) x - rays .",
    "such a power law would drive an evolution of the pulse shapes that is opposite of what is observed .",
    "thus , we find that the detailed evolution of the x - ray emission from  further supports the assumption of a purely thermal spectral model , and leaves no evidence of a steep power law as is commonly fitted to individual observations of axps .    since the first observation of  it was apparent that the broad - band pulse shape is not a simple sine function ; the pulse peak is relatively sharp with a broader inter - pulse trough ( paper  i ) .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at higher energy , where the profile is nearly triangular in shape .",
    "this suggests that the pulse profiles can be decomposed into a triangle function and a sinusoidal function , a model that was explored for the earlier data sets and detailed in paper  ii & iii .",
    "this model continues to be appropriate for the new data and is used to extract unbiased pulsed fraction measurements for the profiles shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "given the success in modeling the pulse profiles with these functions it is natural to associate the two pulsed components uniquely with the two spectral components , i.e. , the triangle shape for the hotter blackbody component and the sinusoidal shape for the cooler one .",
    "however , we find that we can not model all the profiles in a consistent manner with just a simple superposition of these temporal components , based on the implied flux ratio in each energy band @xcite .",
    "instead we conclude that either the two spectral components contain an admixture of the two shapes or there is a third , unmodeled spectral component present .",
    "this is a direction of active research , to consider the correct characterization of the phase dependent spectral contribution .",
    "considering that the absence of radio emission is a defining characteristic of axps , the serendipitous radio detection from  came as a great surprise . a chance search of vla data taken about a year after outburst reveals an unresolved point source with a flux of @xmath53  mjy at 1.43  ghz , located at the precise coordinates of the taxp @xcite .",
    "other archival vla data obtained at various frequencies provide upper - limits before and after outburst .",
    "a follow - up vla observation in 2006 march yielded a flux of @xmath54  mjy at 1.43  ghz .",
    "together , these results indicate highly erratic radio emission .",
    "a second surprise came with the detection around that time of pulsed radio emission at the x - ray period @xcite .",
    "this search , at @xmath55  ghz using the parkes radio observatory , revealed a narrow , bright pulse with a high degree of linearly polarization @xcite .",
    "a series of multi - frequency measurements in 2006 april - may confirms the erratic flux behavior and provides an unusual spectral slope of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "@xmath58 for a typical radio pulsar ) . a revised distance to the pulsar of @xmath13  kpc",
    "is inferred from the pulsar s dispersion .",
    "a search for pulsations in archival data acquired in 1997/1998 produced a null result and argues against significant emission prior to the outburst event .",
    "a summary of these radio observations is shown in figure  [ fig : radio ] .",

    "although transient axps such as  are relatively rare , their short active duty cycle suggests the existence of a larger population of unrecognized young nss .  provides a unique window into this population , with prior measurements in the quiescent state and detailed observations during its active , pulsed phase",
    "ultimately , we hope to use this taxp to give insight into the emission mechanisms of magnetars , in general . with the discovery of pulsed radio flux , this may carry over to interpreting emission mechanism of radio pulsars , as well .",
    "below we now summarize our initial attempts to interpret the  results in the context of a physical model .",
    "first we outline the basic arguments for the two - temperature blackbody spectral model as a plausible alternative to the nominal power - law plus blackbody model .    while both models give reasonable fits to the spectrum , it s important to note that the power - law component is used to model the _ low energy residuals and not any high - energy tail_. without a low energy cut - off of this component , it is not possible to connect it with the observed ir emission without an energy catastrophe . as detailed in paper",
    "ii , invoking synchrotron self - absorption is excluded by radius / magnetic - field inconsistently .",
    "in contrast , the extrapolated spectrum of the warm blackbody component does not exceed the measured ir flux .",
    "furthermore , currently there is no acceptable physical model to anchor a power - law component .",
    "as discussed earlier , the two components of the double blackbody model can be associated with a pair of hot spots on the surface of the star .",
    "the warm temperature component , covering a large fraction of the ns surface , is consistent with the decreased pulsed fraction at lower energies .",
    "the hotter blackbody component is consistent with a smaller emission area and greater modulation at higher energies .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of this issue can be found in paper  ii .",
    "determining the emission geometry on the ns is of great interest .",
    "the natural conclusion of applying the double blackbody model to the time resolved spectra and pulse profiles is that concentric hot regions give rise to the observed modulation .",
    "we consider a model of the phase - resolved spectrum taking into account the viewing geometry and offset of the hot spots from the rotation axis ( perna & gotthelf 2006 , in prep . ) .",
    "this is based on the ns emission model given in @xcite that includes general relativistic effects ( redshift and light bending ) .",
    "our goal is to match spectrum and energy dependent pulse shape in order to determine viewing geometry , distance , and ns size .",
    "preliminary work is able to reproduce the pulsed fraction to a reasonable degree but the pulse shape remains elusive .    a framework for a theoretical interpretation of the emission from  is suggested by the magnetar coronal model of @xcite .",
    "according to this model , the large outburst was generated by a starquake that resulted in a transition to an active coronal state that caused energy to be stored in the twisted b - field of the coronal loop .",
    "particles ( mostly @xmath59 ) are accelerated within this loop and impact the ns surface with gev energy .",
    "this heats up the loop footprint resulting in the observed hot spot emission .",
    "the decay timescale of the coronal loop , and thus the hotter component of the double blackbody luminosity , is of order of a few years .",
    "the decay rate is determined by ohmic dissipation of current in the excited loop .",
    "a cooler component likely arises from deep crustal heating associated with the initial outburst and possibly earlier ones .",
